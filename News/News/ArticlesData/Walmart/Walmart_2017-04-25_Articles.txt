Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 26 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Amy Witherite Discusses Walmart’s Decision To Test Dual-Facing Cameras In Semis Dallas, 04/25/2017 /SubmitPressRelease123/ By now, you have probably heard of the fatal semi-truck wreck involving a Walmart truck driver, Kevin Roper, 35, of Jonesboro, GA, and comedian Tracy Morgan. Morgan suffered a traumatic brain injury, but his friend, James McNair, was killed in the accident. Investigators discovered that the truck driver who caused the accident had been awake for 28 hours straight at the time of the wreck and was charged with manslaughter. The truck wreck brought new awareness to the issue of “trucker fatigue” and the abuse of hours of service regulations, which currently limit truck drivers to 11 consecutive hours behind the wheel. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has placed some of the blame for the accident on Walmart, saying the company should have done a better job of training and educating their drivers. NTSB Chairman Christopher Hart believes regulations can only go so far and that companies that employ truck drivers must be vigilant about creating a work culture that discourages violations of safety rules to prevent truck wrecks. Inward-Facing Cameras Divide Truckers Perhaps in response, Walmart recently announced that it is testing dual-facing cameras in some of their semi-trucks. The retail giant has a fleet of about 6,000 trucks. Currently, the program is volunteer-only, with the dual-facing cameras only placed in trucks of drivers who agree to have them on board. Amy Witherite, co-founder and principal of Eberstein Witherite says, “There are other trucking companies exploring the idea of having these types of cameras in their trucks. Some companies have combined the cameras with other technologies, such as warning systems that signal a trucker when the truck drifts out of a lane. There are even safety systems that brake automatically if a truck gets too close to another vehicle.” The dual cameras record both the view immediately ahead of a semi, as well as the interior of the truck, including the driver. The goal is to cut down on safety violations, including texting and driving, talking on cell phones, and driver inattention — all activities that can cause a devastating truck accident. However, not all truck drivers are thrilled with the idea of inward-facing cameras. One trucker likened the interior of his cab to his office, and the area behind his front seat as his home away from home, where he sleeps when he’s on the road. He compared the camera to a Peeping Tom, claiming that the camera is a serious invasion of privacy. Other drivers support the dual cameras, saying it protects them in the event of an accident. They claim that having video footage of the road as well as their actions behind the wheel can prove they were not responsible for a collision.

(WOFL FOX 35) - A heavily lobbied measure that would remove a Depression-era "wall" separating the sale of liquor and groceries was positioned --- after more than two hours of discussion Tuesday --- for a final House vote as soon as Wednesday. The House agreed to take up a Senate-approved version of the proposal (SB 106), after years of debate that has pitted the supermarket giant Publix and small liquor stores against retailers Walmart and Target. House sponsor Bryan Avila, R-Hialeah, said the proposal, which would repeal a decades-old state law requiring stand-alone liquor stores, doesn't make Walmart and Target winners. He said the decision to vote on the Senate measure, which includes a provision regarding convenience stores that was not in the House version, was done in the "spirit of cooperation." Walmart and Target lobbyists have argued that repealing the law is needed to meet customers' demands and convenience. Instead of going elsewhere to buy liquor, shoppers could buy it in the same stores where they pick up groceries and other items. But more than 100 liquor-store owners and employees, many wearing white T-shirts stating "Save Jobs & Small Business Vote No," lined the entryway to the House chamber prior to the session Tuesday. The bill also could affect Publix, which has opened liquor stores in many of the same shopping centers as its supermarkets. Critics pointed to the potential impact of the change on small businesses and the possibility there would be greater access to liquor by minors, either as store employees or shoppers. Rep. Julio Gonzalez, R-Venice, called the proposal "decidedly anti-free market." "Isn't this bill essentially a conduit to allow the large package stores to run amok, to run the small businesses out of the various market places and restrict their ability to find places to conduct their businesses?" Gonzalez said. In addition to repealing the separation law, enacted in 1934 as Florida was responding to the end of Prohibition, the measure would prohibit new package stores from being licensed within 1,000 feet of schools; require small bottles, 6.8 ounces or less, to be displayed only behind the counter; and require that checkout clerks under the age of 18 to be supervised by someone 18 or older when alcohol is being purchased. The Senate voted 21-17 last month to approve the proposal sponsored by Sen. Anitere Flores. It also would require retail businesses that sell gas to be 10,000 square feet or larger to receive liquor licenses. The size restriction had been a sticking point when the proposal first reached the House floor last month. But Avila noted that a number of senators expressed concern about the potential for liquor stores appearing on neighborhood street-corners. "For all intents and purposes I have not seen a gas station, other than the Busy Bee, that is more than 10,000-square-feet," Avila said. Rep. Scott Plakon, R-Longwood, and Rep. Al Jacquet, D-Lantana, failed to convince House members to approve a series of amendments that Avila said were intended to "kill" the bill. One of Plakon's proposals, for example, would have prohibited package stores holding liquor licenses from employing anyone under age 21. "For the first time, tens of thousands of young people, without this amendment, will be in close proximity to hard liquor," Plakon said of his amendment, which failed in a 70-48 vote. By taking up the Senate version, and not making any changes, approval by the House would send the bill to Gov. Rick Scott rather than having the bill bounce back to the Senate.     Information provied by The News Service of Florida.   false false false false false false false false false Popular false false false Recent Teen shot at apartment complex; suspect sought Deputies investigate attempted abduction Marijuana bill moving to full Florida Senate Deputies search for missing Orlando man Police nab shooting suspect after multi-car crash Stories You May Be Interested In – includes Advertiser Stories false false false All content © Copyright 2000-2015 Fox Television Stations, Inc.

Todd Hembree, attorney general for the Cherokee Nation, says drug companies didn't do enough to keep painkillers off the black market or to stop the overprescription of these powerful narcotics, which include OxyContin and Vicodin. "They flooded this market," Hembree says. "And they knew — or should've known — that they were doing so." Walgreens, CVS Health and Wal-Mart are all named in the suit, along with the nation's three largest pharmaceutical distributors: AmerisourceBergen, McKesson and Cardinal Health. They act as middlemen between pharmacies and drugmakers, distributing 85 to 90 percent of the prescription painkillers that some see as fueling a growing opioid epidemic in the U.S. When reached for comment, one of the defendants, Cardinal Health, sent a statement to NPR saying the suit was a mischaracterization of facts and a misunderstanding of the law. "We believe these lawsuits do not advance the hard work needed to solve the opioid abuse crisis — an epidemic driven by addiction, demand and the diversion of medications for illegitimate use." But the Cherokee Tribe says these companies regularly filled large, suspicious prescriptions within the Cherokee Nation's 14 counties in northeastern Oklahoma. It also says the companies turned a blind eye to patients who doctor-shopped and presented multiple prescriptions for the same medication. Oklahoma, where 177,000 tribal members live, leads the nation in opioid abuse. Almost a third of the prescription painkillers distributed in that state went to the Cherokee Nation. "There are safeguards that are supposed to be followed — federal laws — that they turn a blind eye to because their profits are much more important to them," Hembree says. "We were being [overrun] by the amount of opioids being pushed into the Cherokee Nation." A spokesperson for Walgreens told NPR the company declines to comment on pending litigation. CVS Health said in a statement, "We have stringent policies, procedures and tools to ensure that our pharmacists properly exercise their corresponding responsibility to determine whether a controlled substance prescription was issued for a legitimate medical purpose before filling it." The other companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Nowhere has the country's opioid crisis hit harder than in Indian Country. Compared with other racial and ethnic groups in the U.S., American Indians have the highest rate of drug-induced deaths in the country. The use of OxyContin by American Indian high-schoolers is double the national average. The lawsuit estimates opioid abuse led to over 350 deaths within the Cherokee Nation between 2003 and 2014. Cherokee babies are often born with an opioid addiction resulting from their mothers' use of prescription painkillers throughout the pregnancy. Some spend their first moments on earth suffering through withdrawals. "They will have shakes, they will cry, and a lot of these children go on to have developmental and cognitive issues," Nikki Baker-Limore, executive director of child welfare for the Cherokee Nation, says. "These children are born and they don't even have a chance the second they come out of the womb." Several studies suggest that high rates of addiction in Indian Country stem from the violence and cultural destruction brought down upon Natives over the past 200 years. Because both trauma and resilience are remembered in our DNA, the genocide and forced removal of Cherokee and other tribes from their homelands by the U.S. government during the early 19th century has resulted in generational trauma. Cherokee Nation claims in the suit that drug companies are making money off a vulnerable population and ignoring epidemiological and demographic facts. While this is the first time an Indian Nation has sued top drug distributors and pharmacies, it's not the first case of its kind in the country. The city of Everett, Wash., recently filed suit against Perdue Pharmaceuticals, the maker of OxyContin, for allowing its drug to saturate the black market. West Virginia, one of the hardest hit places in the nation's opioid epidemic, settled with Cardinal Health for $20 million last year. Soon after, the federal government slapped Cardinal Health and McKesson with multimillion-dollar fines for failing to report suspicious orders of controlled substances to the Drug Enforcement Agency. "Legal action is one of the only effective measures we have against pharmaceutical companies and distributors," Adriane Fugh-Berman, an associate professor in the Department of Pharmacology and Physiology at Georgetown University, says. Fugh-Berman has served as an expert witness in several cases against pharmaceutical companies. "Companies don't like lawsuits," she says. "It's a great way to get information into the public domain." But the Cherokee Nation's lawsuit is different from other cases in a fundamental way: It was filed in tribal court. By doing so, lawyers for the Cherokee Nation say they hope to gain quicker access to internal corporate records. However, Hembree says they expect the defendants will file a motion to move the case into federal courts. "We're ready for that jurisdictional battle and we look forward to trying this case in Tahlequah, Okla.," Hambree says, referring to the Cherokee Nation's headquarters. The suit seeks billions of dollars in damages, and Hambree hopes it will help change the behavior of drug distributors and pharmacies. "I can't put Cardinal Health and McKesson and Amerisource in jail, but I can make them responsible for the damages they've incurred," he says. Even if the tribe is successful, Fugh-Berman says a change in behavior isn't going to cure the opioid crisis in Indian Country and the U.S. in general. "It's just one piece in this whole fabric of how to stop the opioid epidemic," she says. But curing that one piece could really make a big difference in the Cherokee Nation, according to Baker-Limore. She says the tribe has the infrastructure to provide recovery and rehab services. "Somebody needs to stop letting these opioids be so readily available," she says. "We're a small-town community. It's hitting us hard." Nate Hegyi is a reporter for Montana Public Radio.

The Cherokee Nation is suing a group of companies that sell and prescribe opioids, accusing them of fuelling the opioid epidemic in their communities. (George Frey/Bloomberg/Getty) Related Stories Washington city says pharmaceutical company should pay for opioid crisis 'The system failed': addict kept getting prescribed opioids, says grieving mom 2 Saskatchewan doctors disciplined for handling of opioid prescriptions Former Cape Breton doctor reprimanded for large opioid prescriptions One of the largest Indigenous tribes in the United States is suing a group of companies that includes Walmart and Walgreens, accusing them of fuelling the opioid epidemic in their communities. The Cherokee Nation, whose territory spans 14 counties in northeast Oklahoma, filed the lawsuit this week in the Cherokee Nation District Court, naming AmerisourceBergen, Cardinal Health Inc., McKesson Corp., Wal-Mart Stores Inc., and pharmacies CVS Health and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. as defendants. How one First Nation is fighting opioid addiction "As we fight this epidemic in our hospitals, our schools and our Cherokee homes, we will also use our legal system to make sure the companies, who put profits over people while our society is crippled by this epidemic, are held responsible for their actions," said Cherokee Nation Principal Chief Bill John Baker in a statement. Up to 720 pills per citizen The tribe said that deaths from opioid-related overdoses have more than doubled within the Cherokee Nation in the past decade — surpassing the number of deaths from car crashes. Citing figures from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency, the tribe also accused companies of prescribing an estimated 845 million milligrams of opioids in the 14 counties of the Cherokee Nation in 2015. That averages out to between 360 and 720 pills per year for every prescription opioid user in the Cherokee Nation, which has over 300,000 citizens. Doctors 'part of the problem' in opioid overdose crisis Amid national opioid crisis, Dalhousie teaches doctors how to prescribe safely The lawsuit says that the companies need to do a better job of alerting authorities when large or suspicious orders —which may allow pills to enter the black market — are filled. Cherokee Nation Principal Chief Bill John Baker said his people are 'crippled' by the opioid epidemic. (Cherokee Nation) "These companies must be held accountable for their gross negligence, which has fuelled the opioid epidemic," said Cherokee Nation Attorney General Todd Hembree. "We deserve better." Targeting the sources The lawsuit was applauded by Bryn Wesch, the head of Novus Medical Detox Center, a national drug treatment facility headquartered in Florida. She said better monitoring standards are needed when it comes to prescribing opioids. "How can a doctor prescribe 1,000 pills to a single individual in a day and not have it be a problem?" she said.  But Wesch said the drug manufacturers themselves should also be held responsible for the opioid crisis.  Everett, Wash. sues pharmaceutical company for alleged role in opioid crisis "They're supposed to know their customers, they're supposed to track where their product goes, and they're the ones who are making millions in profits off of it." Companies respond According to the Associated Press, Walmart and McKesson haven't responded to the suit, while Walgreens said it doesn't comment on pending legal cases. Cardinal Health said in a statement that it will defend itself against the allegations and believes the lawsuit does not advance "the hard work needed to solve the opioid abuse crisis — an epidemic driven by addiction, demand and the diversion of medications for illegitimate use." Doctors and pharmacies still doling out opioids to addicted patients, study finds A spokesperson from AmerisourceBergen said the company already stops the shipment of orders it believes are suspicious. "The issue of opioid abuse is a complex one that spans the full health-care spectrum, including manufacturers, wholesalers, insurers, prescribers, pharmacists and regulatory and enforcement agencies," the spokesperson said. 'David and Goliath' "I tip my hat to the Cherokee Nation," said Norman Boudreau, a Winnipeg-based lawyer who often represents First Nations and has launched several large class-action lawsuits in recent years against companies like Volkswagen. More than 100 Volkswagen owners join Winnipeg class action lawsuit Boudreau said such a lawsuit is possible in Canada, where a similar opioid crisis has gripped Indigenous communities — but it would be costly and ultimately a David and Goliath-type battle. If First Nations launching such a suit lost, they would probably be on the hook for potentially costly legal fees, he added. "Pharmaceutical companies have the money and would defend themselves quite fiercely," Boudreau said. As the third-largest tribe in the U.S., the Cherokee are also among the wealthiest and contribute nearly $2 billion to Oklahoma's economy, according to a recent study.

Webb's fortunes changed a few months ago when he wandered into the Salvation Army. All he wanted was a shower. He found new friends, April Morton and Leo Suarez, and from them a network of support. James Edward Bates and his Operation Homeless Hope Facebook page helped raise money to get Webb out of the parking lot and into an apartment. Then Becky Montgomery Jenner heard about Webb and helped him get his discharge papers, which in turn got him into hospice at the Biloxi VA. She took him to Wal-Mart to get new clothes. That was about all he had; new clothes, a duffel bag, two bags of groceries and a food stamp card. He didn't need the food stamps; hospice was providing his meals. So he had Jenner take him to Sam's Club, where he spent the last of his benefits on groceries the two then delivered to the Salvation Army food pantry. A few days later, he died, Suarez and Morton by his side. At Webb's funeral at the Biloxi National Cemetery, his new friends said it was they who were blessed by their friendship with the once-homeless man. And that is the story that gives us hope. And, we should all strive to be like those who looked at Mike Webb and saw not just another homeless soul, but a blessing in disguise. Their world of compassion is the world we all should choose to live in. Online: http://www.sunherald.com/ ___ April 25 The Columbus Commercial Dispatch on Confederate Memorial Day: On Monday, Mississippi observed Confederate Memorial Day, a holiday observed by just two states, Alabama being the other. State employees, at least the ones who haven't lost their jobs after the latest series of state agencies cuts implemented by Gov. Phil Bryant, got the day off, as did some county and city employees around the state. The governor, who has cut the budget, on average, every three months for the past year-and-a-half, keeps telling us we must live within our means and that in these hard economic times, there are some things we just can't afford — education, roads/bridge repairs, mental health services, take your pick. Let's add one more item to the list of things Mississippi can no longer afford: Confederate Memorial Day. The cost goes beyond that associated with providing a paid holiday for those employees who got the day off. The real cost is to Mississippi's image beyond our state borders and the damage it does to a state economy that desperately needs an infusion of jobs. Mississippi is 50th in the nation in both per-capita income ($21,036) and median household income ($39,680). Our state needs every positive factor we can find in trying to appeal to industries and potential residents as they consider their options. Aside from a workforce that can be guaranteed to work for low wages and a state government that must resort to bribery to lure businesses to our state, there are few real incentives. It's an uphill climb. It has always been an uphill climb. Our job growth rate has stalled — only a net of 800 more jobs were created in 2016 than the previous year, according to labor statistics. The national economy is prospering. Our economy is foundering. And yet, even as we try to conjure up new reasons why companies should come here, we stubbornly cling to imagery that creates a negative perception of our state as backwards, regressive and, in the eyes of many, institutionally racist. Relics of our past — the Confederate imagery on our state flag, the governor's annual proclamation of April as "Confederate Heritage Month" and Monday's "Confederate Memorial Day," confirm the very stereotypes our state must escape. Mississippians are free to draw their own conclusion about the propriety of maintaining these traditions, of course. But the time has far since passed that the state should give its sanction to these ideas. The truth is pretty simple: When it comes to recruiting the industries our state so desperately needs, it doesn't matter much what Mississippians think of these tributes to the Confederacy. What matters is what those businesses and industries think of those things. For the overwhelming majority, the Confederacy is forever and indisputably linked with the abomination of slavery. Knowing that, no one in their right mind would insist that this sort of imagery remain a part of its brand. We simply can't afford it. Online: http://www.cdispatch.com/ ___ April 25 The Greenwood Commonwealth on government contracts: Mississippi's "lowest and best" standard for awarding government contracts creates an avenue for public officials to award business to their friends and supporters. What's considered a "best" bid to those who are inclined to push government business to their cronies may not be best for the taxpayers. By even the most liberal definition of "best," however, it is incredible that the staffs of the state's Information Technology Services Department and the corruption-scarred Department of Corrections have recommended that a $4.8 million contract be awarded to a company implicated in the Chris Epps prison bribery scandal. That contract with California-based Sentinel Offender Services was tabled last week after a Republican lawmaker who sits as a non-voting member on the ITS board raised questions about the propriety of doing business with a company that's being sued by the state over a previous contract for the same service that the new contract would cover — monitoring offenders on probation or parole. Attorney General?Jim Hood has brought litigation against Sentinel and several other companies whose business with the state was allegedly contingent on funnelling kickbacks to Epps, the former corrections commissioner who is awaiting sentencing for his graft. According to federal prosecutors, Sentinel paid a Gulf Coast consultant, Robert Simmons, $4,000 a month from 2012 to 2014, from which Simmons then kicked back $1,400 to Epps. Simmons has pleaded guilty to bribery in the case. Although Sentinel has denied any knowledge of the kickbacks and no criminal charges have been brought against the company, Hood disputes its profession of ignorance and claims it is civilly responsible for what took place. Until this matter is cleared up, the state should not be entering into any new business with Sentinel. One of the ways to deter graft is to penalize the companies that benefitted from it, whether knowingly or unknowingly. Simmons was one of Sentinel's agents. He acted on the company's behalf, and at the minimum Sentinel should have kept closer tabs on him. Gov. Phil Bryant, a former state auditor, suggests that awarding a new contract to Sentinel, while this cloud hangs over it, is inappropriate, even if it's legal. He is right.

Walmart says its ethics and compliance focus is part of its efforts to grow in this “new era of retail” and to position the business for sustainable growth and shareholder returns. So how is Walmart improving its approach to ethics and compliance? Organize compliance staff into one global organization   Walmart needed a clear, global view of its ethics and compliance issues. The company decided its ethics and compliance function should be consolidated into one global group, rather than establishing separate compliance teams that reported to its market or divisional business leaders. The company appointed chief ethics and compliance officers, as well as anti-corruption directors, within each of its retail markets. The company organized them and their staff into one global organization; the teams were arranged to support but operate independently from local business management. The company gained a clearer view into ethics and compliance issues and increased consistency in its standards and processes. Walmart has assigned 300 associates to monitor and track compliance across the company’s 56,000 licenses and permits. Significant training for ethics and compliance leaders   In restructuring its ethics and compliance program, Walmart wanted each of its businesses to have both subject-matter experts and teams that were well trained and able to put policies into practice, given local conditions and laws. Walmart invested in a multi-year effort to appoint and train ethics and compliance associates throughout its business. Its dedicated ethics and compliance staff now numbers over 2,300 associates. Invest in technology   In order to reliably and efficiently track its governance programs, Walmart knew technology would be essential. The company developed and deployed electronic systems to implement anti-corruption policies, obtain and monitor licenses and permits, enhance food safety, track donations to the community, provide training to associates, and comply with anti-money-laundering obligations, among other functions. Walmart says that since 2013 it has invested more than $141 million in global ethics and compliance systems, including building and deploying its own centralized licensing system. The system allows teams to monitor and track licenses and permits in each market, reducing the risk of error or wrongdoing by organizing workflows and implementing safeguards such as requirements for approvals and documentation for paying required fees. The system also provides a repository for licensing information, thereby creating transparency and enabling the company to monitor compliance with both global policy and local procedures. Ensuring food quality and safety   For several years, Walmart says it has been deploying an electronic system to monitor the temperatures of the foods in its stores in order to maintain the right temperature for each type of fresh food. Over the last year, Walmart has installed the system in 630 additional stores. The system is active throughout the US and in many of its international markets. It records over four million food temperatures each month in the US alone. These electronic data help the teams track trends, identify issues, and maintain food at optimal temperatures. Seeking recognition for results   Walmart points out that the New York Stock Exchange Governance Services recognized Walmart for having “the best governance, risk and compliance program at a large-cap company.” The external validation helps the company know that it’s on the right path, Walmart says. External validation is also important to help the company overcome the situation that has hounded it since 2012, when the New York Times uncovered a history of bribery in Mexico that Walmart had been engaged in to help expand its business there. The company’s stock value dropped by $17 billion following the report; Walmart began reporting its on global ethics and compliance shortly thereafter, according to Compliance Week. Walmart is still facing a potential $600 FCPA settlement.

Mueller told the Northwest Arkansas Business Journal his two-person business is growing beyond expectations and Wal-Mart Stores of Bentonville is the big reason why. Carolina Gumbaya recently landed in 234 Walmart U.S. stores in eight southeastern states, as well as Publix and Harris Teeter grocery stores. Mueller, a former restaurant owner growing up in the food business, said flavors always intrigued him, and when he relocated to Myrtle Beach in 2012 he began experimenting with gumbo made from locally sourced fish, shrimp, sausage and fresh vegetables. New Orleans has somewhat been the standard for gumbo over the years, but his research found the dish could also be traced back to South Carolina in the 1600s. He and partner Laura Spencer came up with their own version of gumbo which could be sold into retail. He said Carolina Gumbaya has less preservatives including salt, and the rue is blonde, not dark. He said the gumbo is thick, almost stew-like, and the product does not contain rice, like other products on the market. “It’s a base product, but consumers can cook their own rice and add it to the gumbo for serving,” Mueller said. “Some people also like to add chicken. Our recipe doesn’t burn the tongue, but the diverse flavors in the dish explode on the back of the tongue as it’s eaten.” GROWING INTO WALMART Mueller said his gumbo was selling well at festivals and farmer’s markets, so he waltzed into his local Walmart U.S. store in December 2013 and asked to talk to the manager. He was hoping for 10 minutes of his time, but what he hadn’t expected was immediate interest from regional manager Steve Harvey. About 45 minutes later the managers told him they would help him champion the product. “They turned me over to Katherine Johnson, the seafood buyer at the time who worked closely with me to align production so that the product could go into retail stores,” Mueller said. “I outsourced my manufacturing to Duke Productions that already makes products sold at Wal-Mart. This helped to streamline the process. About 18 months later Carolina Gumbaya made its way into 17 Walmart stores in South Carolina.” He said it was baby steps at first and that was exactly the right strategy for his small operation. About a year later the product was expanded into 137 stores in five states. In September 2016, new buyer Tom Thurow expanded the footprint to 237 stores in eight states. The product is frozen and sold in the fresh frozen cases in the seafood section. “It really has been an amazing experience, to see so many people embrace this recipe I created in the kitchen of my own home,” he said. “People told me doing business with Wal-Mart could be a mistake, but that simply hasn’t been my experience.” Mueller has expanded his product line and plans to offer a vegetarian version of the gumbo as well as spiced rub. With Wal-Mart’s Open Call slated for June 28, Mueller is hoping to pitch his ideas to buyers, well ahead of the next scheduled product review meeting in September. Wal-Mart considers Carolina Gumbaya part of its initiative to buy more products made in the U.S. and further the expansion of U.S. manufacturing jobs. Mueller has not added additional personnel, but his manufacturer has added 23 new full-time jobs to meet the increased demand, according to Scott Markley, corporate spokesman for Wal-Mart. “Our customers tell us that where products are made is most important second only to price,” Markley added.

In an announcement, store manager Gerilynn Olson said the business will be hiring full- and part-time workers but did not say what positions are to be filled. "Portage Walmart is seeking highly motivated individuals who will provide the excellent service our customers expect daily," Olson said in a press release. Interested job applicants may apply online at http://careers.walmart.com.  The Portage Walmart is being expanded from 151,000-square-foot general merchandise store to a 190,000-square-foot store that will carry additional grocery merchandise and have a full-service pharmacy with drive-through, a tire and lube express, a garden center and an eight-pump gas station adjacent to its south entrance. Construction started last summer and the expansion is to be completed this summer. The majority of new associates were expected to begin work in May to help prepare the store for its grand opening, according to the release. Walmart's website allows people to apply for jobs in seven categories: cashier and front end associate; cart attendant and janitorial associate; stocker, backroom and receiving associate; sales associate; fresh food associate; and department management. It also allows people to apply for specialized areas such as its pharmacy, its optical care, and auto areas.

It also said it offers eligible associates: matching 401(k) contributions of up to 6 percent of their pay; discounts on general merchandise; an Associate Stock Purchase Program; and company-paid life insurance.

LIVE SMARTER Smart Shopping BIG QUESTIONS Lists VIDEOS QUIZZES STORE PLUS Amazing Facts Job Secrets Language Space Weather World War I Kennections LIVE SMARTER SMART SHOPPING BIG QUESTIONS LISTS VIDEOS QUIZZES PLUS Amazing Facts Job Secrets Language Space Weather World War I Kennections STORE Walmart Unveils the ‘Crotilla,' a Tortilla and Croissant Hybrid Share Michele Debczak filed under: Food image credit: Walmart Like us on Facebook Pastry fanatics lined up the block to get a taste of Dominque Ansel’s uber-trendy Cronut after its debut in 2013. Time will tell if customers will do the same for the latest pastry hybrid from Walmart: the "Crotilla," a mix between a tortilla and a croissant, which Delish reports hit 800 Walmart stores on April 17. “We know customers, especially millennial customers, are hungry for new food trends and cool ways to experience food," Walmart Bakery’s senior buyer Bradlee Underwood said in a statement, "and we want to be a destination for that.” If you’re confused about how to eat a combination of two foods that rarely appear on the same menu, Walmart has a few recommendations. “You can add Nutella and bananas for breakfast, or dress up a burger for lunch, or even make mini pizzas in the toaster oven for a fun dinner one night,” Underwood suggests. Walmart Walmart isn’t the first brand to attempt to cash in on the pastry mashup trend. Since the Cronut, we’ve seen the Mufgel (muffin bagel), the Cherpumple (pie in a cake), and the Capookie (cake in a cookie in a pie). Based on the response to Crotilla so far, which has ranged from bewilderment to contempt, the product isn’t on its way to living up to the Cronut’s legacy.

Plans to build a Wal-Mart in McCandless have died. But the political storm created by those plans is very much alive. Voters in one McCandless ward will decide next month whether to shift the balance of power on council from those who voted to approve the Wal-Mart plan to those who opposed it. Incumbent Ward 6 Councilman Ralph LeDonne faces a challenge in the May 16 primary from fellow Republican Carolyn Schweiger. She has the support of the political action committee McCandless 4 Tomorrow, which along with the group Citizens of McCandless, formed in the wake of town council's 2014 decision to approve the Wal-Mart project. The groups vowed to replace council members such as LeDonne who approved the Wal-Mart project with ones they support. With no Democrats running for their party's nomination in Ward 6, the winner of the May 16 Republican primary will be assured a victory in the fall barring a successful write-in campaign. Schweiger, who recently changed her political party affiliation from Democrat to Republican, said while she has long been concerned about how McCandless government operates, the Wal-Mart issue was a tipping point. An Allegheny County judge ruled that town officials acted properly — a decision upheld in a series of appeals that reached the state Supreme Court. Despite losing in court, the residents group claimed victory because their legal filings delayed the project until Giant Eagle bought a small portion of the Blazier Drive property Wal-Mart wanted to develop, essentially killing the project. In 2015, McCandless 4 Tomorrow and the residents group used the Wal-Mart issue to help elect council members Kim Zachary, Steve Mertz and Gregory Walkauskus. Schweiger served as campaign manager for Mertz, who along with Zachary, switched from Democrat to Republican prior to seeking office. Even if LeDonne fends off Schweiger's challenge, efforts to replace council members with the Citizens-aligned candidates will continue in the fall. Republican Bill Kirk is running unopposed in the primary for the Ward 2 seat. Incumbent council President Gerard Aufman, also a Republican, withdrew from the race after deciding against seeking a 12th term as the Ward 2 representative. In November, Kirk will face Democrat Barbara Richards, a vocal members of Citizens of McCandless, who also is uncontested for her party's nomination in the primary. Councilwoman Joan Powers, who represents Ward 4, is running unopposed in the Republican primary. There are no Democrats seeking the seat, which means Powers is virtually assured reelection in the fall. In the 15 months since taking office, Zachary, Mertz and Walkauskus have clashed with the four other members of council over issues such as appointments to advisory boards and the vote in December to reduce property taxes, which they did not support. Zachary and Mertz most recently voted against adopting the guiding documents for operation of the new McCandless/Northern Allegheny Heritage Center, which has become a rallying point for the resident group's efforts to replace council members. Group members have accused town officials of poor planning for the project and hiding the true cost of construction. They say the town's efforts and resources would have been better spent on developing a community center. Town officials say all costs associated with the heritage center project followed proper accounting practices, were presented to members of council and approved at public meetings. Schweiger said while she “appreciates what he (LeDonne) has done” in reference to his years as a township employee and then as an elected official, she thinks it is time for a change. “I've attended a lot of meetings and see how they treat people when someone tries to make a suggestion or give them an idea,” Schweiger said. “I want to listen to and represent everybody. Even if we have differences, I want to get away from this negativity and work together with people.” LeDonne said he is seeking a fourth term on council to address several key issues facing the community. “I want to do more to deal with the opioid addiction crisis by working with the school district to emphasize to students the dangers of getting involved with drugs,” he said. LeDonne, who chairs council's public safety committee, said he also wants to continue work to ease traffic problems in the town, address issues related to stormwater management and strengthen public safety. “Our police departments and fire services are among the most highly regarded in the area and I want to ensure that they continue to receive the training and equipment they need to continue providing that high level of service,” the retired McCandless police chief said. He said the town's current leadership cut the property tax rate this year to make it the second-lowest in Allegheny County without sacrificing services such as road paving and maintenance of municipal facilities. LeDonne said he is “not surprised” that the residents group is using the heritage center in much the same way the Wal-Mart project was used. “As this (heritage center) project progressed, council received regular updates and reports at our (public) work sessions,” he said. “We have line items expenditures for every dollar spent. So in my opinion, this is absolutely political. These tactics worked in the past, so why would they stop now? I think it's something we're going to continue to see in McCandless.” Tony LaRussa is a Tribune-Review staff writer. Reach him at 724-772-6368 or tlarussa@tribweb.com.

Walmart Tries Its Hand At Stunt Foods With Whatever A ‘Crotilla’ Is Supposed To Be Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Walmart Tries Its Hand At Stunt Foods With Whatever A ‘Crotilla’ Is Supposed To Be April 25, 2017 12:30 pm EDT By Ashlee Kieler@akieler bakery croissant Crotilla food franken-food mash-up retail stunt food that's so fetch? tortilla trying to make crotilla happen walmart Fast food companies have never been shy when it comes to shocking customers and drumming up business with odd food mash-ups like fish stick pizza, fried chicken or fried egg shell tacos, Cheetos chicken fries, the list goes on, and on, and on. But now it appears that Walmart is looking to get a piece of the stunt food pie with the debut of a tortilla-croissant bakery item.  Walmart announced Monday the creation of a hybrid bakery item, dubbed the Crotilla. Described as a combination of a croissant and a tortilla, Walmart says that in creating the flatbread-like bread it took a page from the Cronut sensation, using two products customers already loved and making it into one. “Also, we know customers, especially millennial customers, are hungry for new food trends and cool ways to experience food, and we want to be a destination for that,” Bradlee Underwood, senior buyer for Walmart Bakery, said in a blog post. The company believes that customers — millennials in particular — will be attracted to the Crotilla’s convenience and versatility in use for things such as breakfast sandwiches, pizzas, or burgers. In order to promote the new item, Walmart dedicated today, April 25 National Crotilla Day, a move that was perhaps predictably mocked by Twitter. @beerinator I thought a ‘crotilla’ was a road-kill crow? — Phineas (@Phineas) April 25, 2017 Wait, the "#crotilla" is a thing now? — RC Guerrilla (@RCGuerrilla) April 25, 2017 They were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn’t stop to think if they should.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 25 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Walmart Highlights Progress in Creating Shared Value in Tenth Annual Global Responsibility Report 2017 report outlines the retailer’s milestones in creating shared value for people, business and society BENTONVILLE, Ark., Apr. 20 /CSRwire/ – Walmart today released its tenth annual Global Responsibility Report, which looks back at the company’s progress during fiscal year 2017 in advancing the key areas of opportunity, sustainability and local communities. The report also looks ahead at the retailer’s role in helping rewire whole social and environmental systems as it strives toward a new era of trust and transparency.   “At Walmart, we aim to use our strengths and collaborate with others to transform the systems we all rely on,” said Kathleen McLaughlin, chief sustainability officer and president of the Walmart Foundation. “We believe that the value-maximizing strategy is the one that creates shared value for customers, business, and society.” The three aspirational goals Walmart set in 2005 remain constant to this day while the company’s approach and vision of global responsibility continue to evolve. This past November, the retailer announced a new approach in advancing the key areas of opportunity, sustainability and community which consists of a 10-year vision to create shared value and underscores the importance of true integration into the company’s core business. Notable milestones and progress from the 2017 Global Responsibility Report include: Increasing Economic Opportunity in Retail Supply Chains Supporting Economic Mobility in Retail for Walmart Associates and Beyond Enhancing associate opportunity: Walmart is addressing barriers that can impede career advancement for associates. In FY2017, Walmart completed a $2.7 billion investment in U.S. associates that included increases in training, education and higher wages. Accelerating frontline retail job mobility beyond Walmart:  In addition to investing in its own associates, Walmart and the Walmart Foundation in 2015 launched the Retail Opportunity Initiative, a five-year, $100 million sector-wide effort aimed at strengthening the transferability of skills of the U.S. retail workforce and developing ways to make it easier for front-line workers to advance their careers.  Through the end of FY2017, Walmart and the Walmart Foundation invested more than $59 million and collaborated with leading nonprofits, employers, government agencies and educational institutions such as the Chicago Cook Workforce Partnership, The League of Innovation and the Aspen Institute.  Investing in American Jobs Supporting local, diverse and small businesses: In 2013, Walmart pledged to purchase $250 billion more in products supporting American jobs through 2023. To raise awareness for this initiative, Walmart hosted the U.S. Manufacturing Summit and Open Call for new U.S. made products in June 2016. Entrepreneurs from 40 states participated in 800 meetings at the event. Walmart, the Walmart Foundation and the U.S. Conference of Mayors launched a $10 million U.S. Manufacturing Innovation Fund in 2014. The fund supports innovative research into manufacturing processes. The FY2017 funding cycle marks the completion of the $10 million commitment; however, the projects continue to advance. Enhancing the Sustainability of Operations and Our Value Chain Reducing Emissions, Energy Intensity and Waste In Operations Setting emissions reduction goals:  Walmart is the first retailer with an approved science-based target emissions-reduction plan. The company aims to reduce its absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 18 percent by 2025. The retailer will also work with its suppliers to reduce CO2e, or carbon dioxide equivalent, emissions from upstream and downstream Scope 3 sources by one billion tons (a gigaton) between 2015 and 2030. Continued advancement toward 100 percent renewable energy goal: Walmart aspires to eliminate reliance on fossil fuel-based energy sources by meeting its needs with 100 percent renewable energy. By 2025, Walmart aims to power 50 percent of its operations with renewable energy. At the end of FY2017, approximately 26 percent of Walmart’s electricity needs globally were supplied by renewable sources, including more than 460 onsite and offsite projects in operation or under development globally. Progress toward zero waste goal: By the end of FY2017, Walmart diverted from landfills 82 percent of materials previously considered waste from Walmart U.S., and 77 percent* from Walmart International. As a large global grocer, Walmart is also committed to reducing food waste within its own operations. Since 2005, Walmart stores, clubs and distribution centers have donated more than 3.3 billion pounds of food to organizations that distribute to those in need in the U.S., including more than 600 million pounds in FY2017. Improving Sustainability in Global Value Chains Working with our suppliers: Since 2014, suppliers have reported a 96 percent reduction of high priority chemicals by weight in Walmart U.S. stores. In FY2017, Walmart reached a goal set in 2012, of buying 70 percent of the company’s U.S. goods from suppliers that participate in the Sustainability Index, in categories where the Index is available.  Strengthening Local Communities Relieving Hunger Efforts to donate 4 billion meals: Walmart and the Walmart Foundation surpassed the halfway point in their goal to provide 4 billion meals over five years, by providing support for 2.4 billion meals to date since 2014. In FY2017, Walmart and the Walmart Foundation donated more than $50 million toward hunger relief. Strengthening the capacity of hunger relief programs: Walmart and the Walmart Foundation are helping organizations who are on the front lines of charitable food provision to improve their infrastructure, so they can increase access to charitable meals.   In the U.S., Walmart stores and Sam’s Club locations teamed up with customers and participating suppliers to support Feeding America through the “Fight Hunger. Spark Change.” campaign, raising more than $17 million in funds in FY2017. Engaging associates to volunteer: Walmart associates around the world are dedicated to addressing hunger. In the U.S. alone, Walmart associates donated more than 110,000 hours toward hunger relief in FY2017. In FY2017, 73,000 full-and part-time associates volunteered more than 1.2 million hours generating more than $12 million in Walmart donations. Strengthening Disaster Response and Community Preparedness Increasing disaster relief and preparedness efforts: In FY2017, Walmart and the Walmart Foundation supported communities after 30 disasters. A total of $6.8 million in cash donations was given specifically for disaster preparedness and relief. * Based on review of material handling and waste diversion processes in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Central America, Chile, Japan, Mexico, South Africa, U.K., and U.S., as reported by waste vendors, food banks and stores. In cases where real numbers were not available due to industry challenges they have been estimated based on industry acceptable standards. About Walmart Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 25 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Is Wal-Mart’s New E-Commerce Acquisition Strategy Any Better Than Its Old One? Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) has been on a buying spree since last summer, when it bought Jet.com for $3 billion. It’s since snatched up several smaller e-commerce websites for less than $100 million each. Most recently, it’s been in talks to buy upscale men’s clothing retailer Bonobos for $300 million. Despite the somewhat higher price tag, it follows the same strategy as Wal-Mart’s other recent acquisitions. Wal-Mart is buying up retailers selling for a relative bargain. For example, just last year Bonobos was seeking funding at a $500 million valuation, but those talks seem to have fallen through. Wal-Mart could be getting 40% off retail for the retailer. But Wal-Mart’s new e-commerce acquisition strategy is very similar to its old acquisition strategy with Wal-Mart Labs. Between 2011 and 2014, Wal-Mart acquired 15 small companies tied in some way to e-commerce. The other thing most of them had in common was that they were selling for a bargain after failing to attract a new round of venture funding. None of them managed to significantly accelerate Wal-Mart’s growth in e-commerce. Will this new strategy prove any more successful? Image source: Wal-Mart. Buying sales growth One key difference in Wal-Mart’s new acquisition strategy is that the online stores it’s buying up will contribute sales directly to Wal-Mart’s online sales. Its previous acquisitions largely supported backend technology for growing e-commerce sales organically. Additionally, Wal-Mart’s acquisitions are focused specifically on the high end of the market. Wal-Mart’s head of e-commerce Marc Lore said the company is specifically pursuing retailers „in the categories where they are long-tail, high-margin products and harder-to-crack brands.” Wal-Mart has failed to attract those kinds of brands to its flagship store because it’s often associated with lower prices and lower quality. Buying up companies like Bonobos or Modcloth will help Wal-Mart sell higher-quality goods at a higher margin. But sales won’t keep growing Growth through acquisition isn’t a bad strategy. The problem with Wal-Mart’s strategy, however, is that these companies are selling for a bargain precisely because their growth is slowing. As such, if Wal-Mart wants its e-commerce sales to keep growing a year from now, it’ll have to keep buying up these small e-commerce retailers. On top of that, Wal-Mart could face backlash from these small boutique retailers’ loyal customer bases. Numerous consumers threatened to take their business elsewhere on social media since reports surfaced of Bonobos’ potential acquisition. What’s more, some of the top talent from these companies, such as Bonobos founder Brian Spaly, have already left to go onto more promising projects. So, Wal-Mart won’t gain the advantage of bringing on a lot of great talent to support growth of its main e-commerce platforms, either. There’s a limit to the number of deals Wal-Mart can find. If it really wants to grow e-commerce, it needs to look for businesses that are selling at a premium because their growth is accelerating. It would cost more upfront, but it would set Wal-Mart up to keep growing e-commerce sales into the future. Jet.com is one such acquisition, which is why it was one of the biggest e-commerce acquisitions in history. By comparison, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has been willing to spend big on its acquisitions. It bough Quidsi (diapers.com, soap.com) for $545 million, Zappos for $1.2 billion, Audible for $300 million, and most recently Souq.com (a Middle Eastern marketplace) for $650 million. While its acquisitions don’t always work out (it recently shuttered Quidsi), Amazon’s willingness to spend has resulted in better growth than Wal-Mart’s. In effect, Wal-Mart’s new acquisition strategy suffers from the same problem that plagued its old one: The companies it’s buying don’t support long-term growth. Wal-Mart is spending hundreds of millions on companies that could just cause more headaches than revenue growth down the line, especially as it has to manage a growing basket of brands. Investors should look for commentary from management during Wal-Mart’s earnings call about how much e-commerce sales growth is coming from these kinds of acquisitions. In all likelihood, though, management will keep that information close to its vest. 10 stocks we like better than Wal-Mart Stores When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

MEREDITH HEUER The New York Times Recipes April 24, 2017 5:21 PM The hippies have won – on our plates and in our kitchen By Christine Muhlke The New York Times It’s Moosewood’s world. We’re just eating in it. Consider granola: The word used to be a derogatory term. Now it’s a supermarket category worth nearly $2 billion a year. Kombucha was something your art teacher might have made in her basement. The company GT’s Kombucha brews more than 1 million bottles annually and sells many of them at Wal-Mart and Safeway. And almond milk? You can add it to your drink at 15,000 Starbucks locations for 60 cents. Just as yoga and meditation have gone mainstream (and let’s not get started on designer Birkenstocks), so have ideas and products surrounding health, wellness and eating that play like a flashback to the early 1970s. Co-op staples of that time – the miso, tahini, dates, seeds, turmeric and ginger that were absorbed from other cultures and populated the Moosewood restaurant cookbooks – now make appearances at some of the most innovative restaurants in the country, where menus are built around vegetables and heritage grains. Vegetarianism and veganism are on the rise; and kale, the bacon of the clean-eating moment, is now routinely heaped on salad plates across the land. The hippies may not have won the election, but they are winning the plate. (Or rather, the bowl.) “The counterculture is always ahead of what’s happening in mainstream culture,” said Peter Meehan, the editorial director of Lucky Peach magazine. “It’s as true in any creative field as it is in food.” Deborah Madison, the author and chef who made vegetarian cooking sophisticated with her 1987 cookbook, “Greens,” has seen this food before: She cooked it in the 1960s and ‘70s, as one of “a growing number of people who were trying to cook differently from our parents,” she said. “Our intentions were good,” Madison continued. “We were using wholesome foods in contrast to our mothers’ new reliance on cake mixes, white flour, TV dinners and that sort of thing.” The problem, she said, was that her generation did not know much about cooking. “What we cooked was very much on the stodgy side,” she said. “Today the same foods are now seen as interesting and delicious and worth eating. We can appreciate their flavors, textures and general possibilities because we – that is, the big collective we – know so much more about cooking foods of all kinds.” The current food mood may also be a reaction to the more exhausting aspects of life in the digital era. “It’s a weird mixture of technology and palo santo” – iPhones and incense – said the chef Gerardo Gonzalez, suggesting that people who live online may be moved to seek out the restorative properties of natural foods. “You’re constantly in this thing that’s not reality, and eating food can be the most real act you can partake in.” At Lalito, his restaurant in Manhattan, Gonzalez serves food he describes as “hippie Chicano,” like vegan chicharrones and the brown goddess cucumber salad, with brown mole vinaigrette, mint and candied pepitas, as well as dishes like eggplant topped with tahini, lemon juice and Japanese gomasio seasoning. (The restaurant opened in late 2016 as Lalo; it was recently renamed to avoid conflict with a similarly named restaurant.) Growing up with chain restaurants and living with the “mental fog” that comes from regularly eating meat, dairy and starch, said Gonzalez, 34, has led him and his peers to seek an alternative. “I think people are now more likely to turn to açai bowls than a bacon cheeseburger for their hangover,” he said. “For a lot of people who gravitate toward this lifestyle, it’s not hypocritical.” As one of the owners of Dimes, a restaurant that opened three years ago in Manhattan, Alissa Wagner is partly responsible for bringing those açai bowls to the Instagram set. Wagner believes that diners are a lot more knowledgeable about where and how to eat better than they were when she graduated from the Natural Gourmet Institute, a mostly vegetarian cooking school in Manhattan, in 2010. “There was a huge awakening that happened in the last couple of years with the way that New Yorkers approach food,” she said. “The meat-heavy, super-masculine-style restaurants that were ever-present became outdated and were overtaken by a much more vibrant and produce-driven menu.” (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.) Some of the most anticipated restaurant openings of the past year have had a crunchy vibe. Tartine Manufactory in San Francisco is never without a line for its rustic sourdough bread, whole-grain pastries and turmeric kefir. At Destroyer in Culver City, the chef Jordan Kahn incorporates elements like puffed rice and pickled mushrooms into his precise and visually arresting cooking. For his avocado toast – a dish that is the spiritual descendant of the ‘70s avocado sandwich, smashed on health bread and topped with a handful of alfalfa sprouts – the avocado is confited. Brunch at the “veg-forward” Bad Hunter in Chicago includes miso-apple sticky buns and sourdough porridge with walnut butter. In New York, Jean-Georges Vongerichten recently opened abcV, an organic, all-vegetable restaurant that serves dishes like “stems and sprouts” with sunflower seeds, and traffics in ayurvedic tonics, which have captivated millennials hunting for the next thing after juice. At L'estudio, the rough-hewed pottery is fired in the cafe’s adjoining ceramics studio. And while the landmark vegan restaurant Angelica Kitchen in Manhattan is closing this week, its legacy is vast – veggie burgers and grain bowls, once a menu rarity, can be had at chains like Hillstone and Sweetgreen. (The chef Camille Becerra, who just opened De Maria, which is heavy on bowls, cooked at Angelica Kitchen – a formative experience.) Even the elegant French restaurant Le Coucou serves avocado toast at breakfast and brunch, charging $18 for the winkingly named “Le Californien.” (END OPTIONAL TRIM.) Despite the often extragravant price tag attached to many haute-hippie staples and the Vitamix required to prepare them, this is food that is easy to make at home, with plenty of cookbooks for guidance. The last several months have seen the release of many vegetable-rich and raw-food cookbooks, including ones from Lucky Peach; Martha Stewart; Wolfgang Puck; the vegan website Thug Kitchen; Sarah Britton, of the website My New Roots, whose Instagram feed of bowls and sprouts has more than 330,000 followers; and Amanda Chantal Bacon of Moon Juice, a small chain of juice shops that started in Venice, in Los Angeles. (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.) In her book and at her shops, Bacon, a former line cook at Lucques in Los Angeles – and the subject of a Twitter storm last summer, after a crystal was stolen from her Silver Lake location – spreads the gospel of coconut yogurt, reishi mushroom powder and meditation, while selling $10 Moon Dusted Milks made with brown rice protein, chia seeds and blue spirulina. Her plans for Moon Dust expansion are global. Madison recently released “In My Kitchen: A Collection of New Vegetarian Recipes.” Her elegant earth-motherhood has given rise to a generation of chefs, cookbook authors and bloggers focused on vegetables and whole foods, like Anna Jones, who wrote the vegetarian cookbook “A Modern Way to Cook.” (Madison, like a baby boomer who is both tickled and horrified to see bell-bottoms come back in style, said she always found it “amusing that foods like the once-abhorrent brown rice have come around to being seen as good to eat, and preferable even to white rice.”) (END OPTIONAL TRIM.) For amateur picklers and kimchi-makers, there is a new edition of “Wild Fermentation,” the 2003 manual that helped its author, Sandor Katz, become a heroic figure among cooks who ferment their own foods. Like the back-to-the landers and Whole Earth Catalog readers before them, a new generation is once again becoming interested in fermentation, especially do-it-yourself projects, a shift that Katz attributes to people becoming more critical of the industrial food system and seeking alternatives. “Once you start asking questions about how this food was produced, then fermentation is just part of the answer,” he said. He also cited recent scientific findings on the microbiome and the notion that health may be affected by bacteria and other microbes living in your intestinal tract, which are in turn influenced by what you eat. “People are recognizing that this important biodiversity inside of us has been diminished and are seeking strategies to restore it for immune function, digestion, mental health and everything else,” he said. “So people are seeking out bacteria-rich foods.” In fact, a kombucha- and tempeh-making business just opened near Katz’s home in Cannon County, Tennessee, population 16,000. “It’s not just happening in New York, San Francisco and Portland,” he said. (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.) (For the record, Katz bristles at the association of fermentation with hippiedom. “In terms of countercultural movements, I feel like punk is much more resonant,” he said. “The punk movement was all about DIY and publishing your own zine, and figuring out how to make things yourself and improvise.”) Gonzalez has noticed a change in diners’ palates toward flavors that are brighter and more acidic, like those produced by fermentation, as well as earthier and umami-rich flavors, like nutritional yeast. “People are starting to realize that these ingredients are a whole new color palette,” he said. (END OPTIONAL TRIM.) This group of Americans has also developed a less-sweet tooth and an appreciation of the textures imparted by grains like buckwheat and rye. “I was in a meeting last night where one person suggested making a chocolate cake recipe with fermented cabbage in it,” Madison said. As with anything counterculture edging toward the mainstream, the threat of co-optation looms. Alice Waters, the Berkeley queen of local and seasonal cooking, applauds the movement away from fast and processed food, but said she was wary of how its language had been appropriated by mainstream brands. “There’s a lot of hijacking going on right now that is very disturbing,” Waters said. “I mean, they can’t quite take ‘organic,' but they’re taking everything else.” At the restaurant level, though, hippie fare has long been “a lifestyle and a brand,” Gonzalez conceded. “You’re not just selling food,” he said. “You’re giving the promise of a healthier life, or a more enlightened meal.” ‘Hippie’ ingredients A home cook in the early ’70s might have been hard-pressed to identify these ingredients, which are now part of mainstream cooking and dining: Açai: The inch-long, reddish-purpleSouth American berry is prized for its antioxidant properties. Kombucha: Fermented, sweetened black or green tea drink. Mirin: A Japanese sweet rice wine. Miso: A staple in Asian cooking, miso is a paste made from fermented soybeans, sea salt and koji, often mixed with rice, barley or other grains. Usually white, red or mixed. An ingredient in soups, sauces and spreads. Tahini: A paste made from sesame seeds, it’s common in Mediterranean and Mideast cooking. Often used as a condiment. Turmeric: The bright gold spice is a key ingredient in many South Asian and Middle Eastern dishes. Compiled by Bee staff Pan-griddled sweet potatoes with miso-ginger sauce Total time: About 1 hour Serves 4 to 6 4 sweet potatoes (about 6 ounces each), scrubbed 1 clove garlic, chopped One 1-inch knob of fresh ginger, peeled and grated A few pinches of sugar or 2 teaspoons mirin 1 heaping tablespoon white miso 1 tablespoon unseasoned rice wine vinegar 1 tablespoon light sesame oil or other neutral oil, plus more for the pan 1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil 2 teaspoons toasted black sesame seeds, for garnish Add about 1 inch of water to a stovetop steamer or a pot fitted with a steaming basket. Add sweet potatoes and steam until tender, 30 to 40 minutes, depending on their size. While sweet potatoes are cooking, make the sauce: Pound garlic and ginger in a mortar until very smooth and then stir in the sugar, miso, vinegar, sesame oils and 1 tablespoon water. Halve steamed sweet potatoes lengthwise and score the cut sides in a crisscross pattern with a small knife. Heat a large skillet or grill pan over medium-high heat. When hot, add a swirl of light sesame oil (about 1 tablespoon), then add sweet potatoes in a single layer, cut side down, and cook for 3 minutes, or until their natural sugars caramelize and turn an appetizing golden brown. (Depending on the shape of your potatoes, you may have to work in batches.) Arrange sweet potatoes on plates or a platter and spoon sauce over them. Garnish with sesame seeds and serve alone or with any accompaniment you like. Miso chicken Time: 45 minutes Serves 4 Recipe from The New York Times. 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened ½ cup white miso 2 tablespoons honey 1 tablespoon rice vinegar (do not use seasoned rice vinegar) Black pepper, to taste 8 skin-on bone-in chicken thighs, approximately 2 1/2 to 3 pounds Heat oven to 425 degrees. Combine butter, miso, honey, rice vinegar and black pepper in a large bowl and mix with a spatula or spoon until it is well combined. Add chicken to the bowl and massage the miso-butter mixture all over it. Place the chicken in a single layer in a roasting pan and slide it into the oven. Roast for 30 to 40 minutes, turning the chicken pieces over once or twice, until the skin is golden brown and crisp, and the internal temperature of the meat is 160 to 165 degrees. Roasted cauliflower with almond-herb sauce Serves 2 for a main course or 4 to 6 as a side dish To make this recipe vegetarian, eliminate the anchovies. Or try the cauliflower with garlic tahini sauce (see recipe). For the cauliflower: 1 large cauliflower Olive oil Salt For the sauce: 1/3 cup blanched almonds 6 to 10 anchovy fillets (optional) 2 garlic cloves, peeled 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus extra for basting 2 teaspoons wine vinegar (white or red), more to taste 1/2 cup coarsely chopped parsley, mint, tarragon, cilantro or a combination 1/2 to 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional) Salt and ground black pepper Heat the oven while you prepare the cauliflower: Place a heavy ovenproof skillet (a cast-iron skillet looks very nice) or a baking sheet in the oven and turn the heat to 375 degrees. Place a small pan of hot water on the floor of the oven, to create steam. Break off and discard the outer leaves from the cauliflower. Cut off the bottom of the stem, and then use the tip of a small, sharp knife to cut off the leaves close to the stem. Carefully cut out the hard core of the cauliflower, near the bottom. Leave the main stem intact and make sure not to cut through any of the florets. Rinse the cauliflower (leave the water clinging to the outside) and place on a work surface, core side up. Drizzle with olive oil and use your hands to rub over the cauliflower until evenly coated. Sprinkle with salt. Place the cauliflower on the hot pan in the oven, core side down, and cook until very tender all the way through when pierced with a knife, at least 1 hour or up to 2 hours. During the cooking, baste 2 or 3 times with more olive oil. It should brown nicely. If you have a convection feature, use it toward the end of baking to brown the crust. Make the sauce: In a small frying pan, toast nuts over low heat, shaking often, just until golden and fragrant. Set aside to cool. Soak anchovies, if using, for 5 minutes in cool water. Rinse and set aside on paper towels. In a food processor, combine almonds, anchovies, garlic and butter and pulse until smooth. Mix in oil, then vinegar. Mix in herbs and red pepper flakes, if using. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Set aside. When cauliflower is tender, remove from the oven. (If desired, run it briefly under the broiler first to brown the surface; there is no need to do this if you used convection.) Serve cauliflower in the skillet or from a serving plate. Cut into wedges and spoon sauce around each wedge. Garlic tahini sauce Makes 1 scant cup Tip: The sauce will keep in the refrigerator for a few days but is best made just ahead, because the taste of garlic grows stronger over time. Recipe via The New York Times. 1 garlic clove, cut in half, green shoots removed Salt to taste 1/3 cup sesame tahini 2 to 4 tablespoons fresh lemon juice (more to taste) Aleppo pepper or red pepper flakes for sprinkling In a mortar and pestle, mash the garlic clove to a puree with a generous pinch of salt. Transfer to a bowl and whisk in the sesame tahini. Whisk in the lemon juice, beginning with the smaller amount. The mixture will stiffen up. Gradually whisk in up to 1/3 cup water, until the sauce has the consistency of thick cream or runny yogurt. Taste and adjust salt. Sprinkle in pepper. Parsnip gratin Serves 4 to 6 For this savory gratin, the parsnips are parboiled and splashed with cream seasoned with turmeric, cumin and cayenne, then topped with feta and baked. 3 pounds parsnips Salt and pepper 2 tablespoons butter, for greasing dish 2 cups heavy cream 1/2 teaspoon turmeric 1/2 teaspoon toasted and ground cumin Pinch of cayenne 4 ounces feta cheese, crumbled Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Peel parsnips and quarter lengthwise. With a paring knife, remove and discard hard central core. Cut parsnips into 3-inch batons. Parboil for 2 minutes, then drain and spread out on a baking sheet to cool briefly. Butter a 9-by-12-inch shallow earthenware baking dish. Arrange parsnips in dish in one layer. Heat oven to 400 degrees. Whisk together cream, turmeric and cumin. Season with salt and pepper and add a small pinch of cayenne. Pour cream mixture over parsnips and sprinkle with feta. Bake for about 30 minutes, until bubbling and nicely browned. Weeknight mushroom and kale pasta Serves 3 to 4 From “100 Days of Real Food Fast & Fabulous,” by Lisa Leake (William Morrow). 1 ounce dried wild mushrooms, such as porcini or shiitake 2 tablespoons butter 2 shallots, diced 3 garlic cloves, minced 1/2 cup dry white wine 3/4 cup heavy cream 3 cups loosely packed kale (thick ribs removed, leaves cut into strips) 1/2 teaspoon salt Ground black pepper 8 ounces uncooked whole wheat pasta, cooked according to the package directions 1/3 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese Combine the dried mushrooms and 1 1/2 cups water in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce to a simmer and cook until the mushrooms have softened, 3 to 4 minutes. Reserving the cooking liquid, drain the mushrooms in a fine-mesh sieve. Measure the cooking liquid and if it’s less than 1 cup, add some water. Dice the mushrooms and set aside. Melt butter in a large saute pan over medium heat. Add mushrooms, shallots and garlic and cook, stirring, until the shallots begin to soften, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour in the wine, increase the heat, and bring mixture to a boil. Cook until the wine almost completely boils off and is reduced down to a couple tablespoons, 3 to 4 minutes (if you are doubling this recipe, it will take longer.) Pour in the reserved mushroom cooking liquid and cook for several minutes until reduced by half. Reduce the heat to medium and add the cream, kale, salt and pepper to taste. Cook until the sauce thickens, 2 to 3 minutes. Fold in the pasta and serve garnished with the Parmesan. West African peanut soup Serves 3-4 This was one of the most popular recipes in the “Sundays at Moosewood Restaurant” cookbook, published more than 20 years ago. This version was simplified for the updated “Moosewood Restaurant Favorites.” Make ahead: The soup can be refrigerated for up to 1 week or frozen for up to 3 months. 1 tablespoon vegetable oil 1 small onion, chopped 1 small celery rib, chopped 1/2 teaspoon sea salt, plus more to taste 1 tablespoon peeled, grated fresh ginger root 1 1/2 teaspoons Tabasco or other hot sauce, plus more to taste 12 ounces sweet potatoes, peeled, then cut into 1/2-inch pieces 1 1/2 cups water 1 1/2 cups tomato juice, preferably low-sodium 1/2 cup creamy peanut butter 2 tablespoons chopped cilantro leaves, plus a few leaves for garnish 1 scallion, white and green parts, cut crosswise into thin slices, for garnish Pour oil into a medium soup pot over medium heat. Add onion, celery and salt; cook, stirring frequently, until softened, 10 to 15 minutes. Stir in ginger and Tabasco. Add the sweet potatoes and water. Increase the heat to medium-high and bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium or medium-low so the liquid is barely bubbling around the edges. Cover and cook until the vegetables are very tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Add the tomato juice and peanut butter. Use an immersion (stick) blender to create a creamy, puréed soup. (If you use a blender instead, work in batches and remove the center knob in the lid, placing a paper towel over the opening to avoid splash-ups. Pour back into the soup pot.) Stir in the chopped cilantro and warm through. Taste, and add salt and/or hot sauce as needed. Divide among bowls and top with the scallions and cilantro leaves. Serve hot. An easy chicken dish relies on miso, plus honey and rice vinegar, for flavoring. RIKKI SNYDER The New York Times West African peanut soup is from the “Moosewood Restaurant Favorites” cookbook. Deb Lindsey The Washington Post Roast cauliflower works as a vegetarian main dish or a side with a meat dish. Serve it with parsley almond sauce, shown here, or garlic tahini sauce (recipes, Page 2D). MELINA HAMMER NYT This savory parsnip gratin includes the spices turmeric, cumin and cayenne.

Edwin Charge Jr., 20, ran through traffic on Interstate 84 and through a residential area before falling off a cliff, said Sgt. Don Cheli of the Hood River Police Department. Two other suspects were jailed, he said. Cheli said police were never in a foot chase with Charge — a Goldendale, Washington, resident — and that officers didn't chase him off the cliff. The fall was accidental, Cheli said. Police initially responded to the Walmart to investigate a theft, he said, and eventually arrested the other two suspects. A state trooper saw Charge, the third suspect, run across the interstate, Cheli said. Officers responded to Westcliff Drive, which sits between the interstate and a bluff that drops to the Columbia River, and a resident told police he saw a man matching Charge's description running east. Police, aware of the dangerous terrain, chose not to go after him, Cheli said. A Union Pacific employee found Charge's body Monday morning. The two other theft suspects, Cadence Rogers and Lynise Browning, were booked into the Northern Oregon Regional Corrections Facility in The Dalles.  Both face second-degree theft charges, court records show.  They're accused of stealing miscellaneous merchandise valued at $100 or more, according to the records. Rogers remains jailed on $500 bail, records show, and Browning was released on bail. — Jim Ryan jryan@oregonian.com 503-221-8005; @Jimryan015 Most Read Active Discussions AM News Snapshot The day's important news, including local and national headlines, delivered every morning.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Essential Tips to Being More Productive So much to do, so little time. But those who are willing to get organized can make it all happen. Alison Southwick and Robert Brokamp, CFP (TMFAlison) Apr 25, 2017 at 7:30PM In this episode of Motley Fool Answers, Alison Southwick and Robert Brokamp welcome Motley Fool co-founder David Gardner to the show as the trio share their secrets to productivity. One of their favorite “gurus” on the subject is David Allen, author of the popular book Getting Things Done, but David has his own approach to clearing a to-do list.  And reaching into the mailbag, the team responds to a Foolish listener in Japan who has concerns about a single stock position that has grown into an outsized portion of his portfolio. A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on January 24, 2017. Alison Southwick: This is Motley Fool Answers. I'm Alison Southwick and I'm joined, as always, by Robert Brokamp, personal finance expert here at The Motley Fool. He's also the advisor on Motley Fool's Rule Your Retirement newsletter and also [part of a new service] coming soon. Robert Brokamp: Oh, yeah. You'll just have to wait on that one. Southwick: Just going to tease that one a little bit. We also have a very, very special guest today. It's David Gardner. He's the co-founder and chief rule breaker of The Motley Fool! David Gardner: I am excited to be back on Answers. Southwick: We love having you. Gardner: There's one or two reasons a year that I'll make it on and I'm really excited about our reason today. So thank you. Yeah! Southwick: I think it's going to be great. Gardner: Yeah, I'm totally psyched. Southwick: I am, too, because today you're going to talk about productivity and the tools that you use to focus on what matters to stay on task. I've written down on my notes that you're a productive juggernaut? I don't know. Is that fair? Gardner: I will absolutely accept that. Guilty as charged. Brokamp: I will second it. Gardner: That's the best compliment that I've received in the last 10 years, and that includes things that my family would have said about me. Southwick: Yeah. I don't know. I don't even know ... Gardner: That's awesome. Southwick: ... if that's a thing, but I'm saying it. Brokamp: It is now. Gardner: That's great. Southwick: So productive juggernaut, David Gardner. Also he founded a little company called The Motley Fool. Maybe you've heard of it. We'll also answer your question about how much of your portfolio should be in one stock and we're going to, of course, close out "There's an App for That" with reviews for a few productivity apps. All that and more on this week's episode of Motley Fool Answers. Southwick: It's time for Answers, Answers and today it comes from Tony in Japan. Brokamp: Hi, Tony. Southwick: People in Japan listen to this show. It's so cool. Konnichiwa! Uh, also you should know how to say "good morning" in ... oh, oh, ohayo gozaimasu. I think that's how you say "good morning." Brokamp: I'll take your word for it. Gardner: You are a language juggernaut. Southwick: Thanks! Thank you! Beer is also biru. So if that's fun, remember that one. That one's important. All right, whatever. Let me move on. Let's get to Tony. Are you still there, Tony? All right. Tony writes: "I hit a home run by buying Amazon back in 2001. I sold a bunch of shares over the years as it continued to rise, but still have a fair number left. I'm reluctant to sell more as I believe the future is still bright, but as a single holding, it's now about 10% of my total individual stock portfolio and 3% of my net worth. Do you normally hang on to big winners even when they become a larger position than you intended?" Brokamp: Well, Tony, your email reminded me of a conversation I had with a member a few years ago because not only did he also live in Japan, but he had more than 50% of his portfolio in Amazon stock because he actually worked for Amazon. Southwick: Oh, wow, yeah. Brokamp: So I gave the typical financial planner speech about how you shouldn't have too much [of one stock] in your portfolio, and to remember what happened to people at Enron and WorldCom. And he said, "Yeah, I know about that, because I did this with my previous employer. Had more than 50% of my stock. Lost everything." And here he was doing it again. So I totally understand how it's very difficult to let go... Gardner: Investors who love too much... Southwick: Aw! Brokamp: Exactly. Exactly. So I understand how that's difficult. If you look at standard financial planning advice, people will tell you, you should limit the amount you have in one stock to about 5% to 10% of your portfolio. So Tony, you're kind of pushing that. There are different factors to consider. First of all, if you work for the company, I would pare it back even more because then you have your investment capital and your human capital all in the same company. It also depends on what the rest of your portfolio looks like. If the other 90% of your portfolio are companies similar to Amazon, then you're not very diversified. If it's very different, then maybe you can have a more concentrated holding in one stock. Now, how much you should have in one stock, as well as how many stocks you should own, is one of those things that among Motley Fool investors is kind of debatable. We all have very different opinions, so I'm going to turn to David Gardner for his opinion, because it might be a little different and he is someone who has done this Amazon journey as well as someone who's owned the stock since 1997. Gardner: And I, at different points over the course of my 30 years of investing (which is a lot, but not nearly as many as many others who are listening to us right now) [am] always conscious that there's a lot more to learn for each of us, even at the age of 50, whatever we are (Robert and not Alison). The way that I've actually lived my life, I've been comfortable with 10%+ positions, but I know myself pretty well and I also know that a lot of my own net worth is tied up in the Motley Fool. So that's enabled me to allow my stock market positions to grow outsized, and it's happened not just from Amazon. Back in the 1990s, it was AOL. It became more than 50% at one point of my portfolio. That's what happens if a stock is up 200x in value on six years ... Southwick: Ugh! Gardner: ... and you let it go. Or more recently -- and this is a great day for Netflix investors -- Netflix is an outsized position in my portfolio. So I think that it comes down to how much you need the money, what your own risk tolerance is, what your backup plan is. One thing I really like Tony mentioned is I like that he said that it's 3% of his net worth. So yes, you should actually not just think of it in terms of your portfolio, but what you have, overall, in this world. As long as everything keeps going well at the Motley Fool, I could probably, literally afford to lose my entire investment portfolio and still be a pretty happy guy, so this is why it's all contextual. Each of us is in a different place -- not just where we are in terms of our age, and not just in terms of our own mentality -- but really I think it comes down to a weird combination of time, who you are, and who's dependent on you. So I think that's a good answer, what you gave, Robert. It's how mutual funds run for the most part. Mutual funds can't usually hold a position more than 5%, so that's why the thinking that you have is aligned, and why it's good. Standard. It's the rules of bridge. I know we need to move on, so I'll just close my answer by saying that if you've ever played the card game bridge, which I have (not that well, but I've played it extensively over the course of a long period of time), you need to learn all the rules to bid. To know how to bid. One spade -- pass. Two hearts. What does that mean? And so once you learn all those rules, now you're ready to really play bridge and the best players know when to break the rules. And so there's a little bit of rule breaker vibe here in my answer, but the best players know when to break the rules, but they're taking a risk to do so, and they know the downside of being burnt. In the case of cards, it's a bad hand. In the case of your wallet or your net worth, it's much, much more important. So I think we each have to get to know ourselves, our time, and proceed accordingly. But I personally have broken a lot of the rules when it comes down to asset allocation by letting big stocks, like Amazon, grow and not selling them. If you're looking at the company, and you believe that Amazon's going to be relevant five, 10 years from now (or Netflix) ... the list goes on ... then I feel comfortable with that. Final, final, final answer from me, then I kick it back to the stars, is that one thing you can do, Tony, [is] systematically sell off portions. So you could just say for any position that I have, if it's outsized ... let's say it's 18% of your portfolio. How about this? How about over the course of the next eight years, sell off 1% of that stock? Of your 18%, I should say, every year, so that you're down to 10% over the course of the next eight years. And it doesn't matter where the stock is at that point. It might be down. It might be up. You just systematically (and I'm picking arbitrary numbers and time line here) but sell down a portion over time, because you're going to be able to redeploy the funds. Southwick: All right. As a reminder, David Gardner, co-founder and chief rule breaker of The Motley Fool is joining us in-studio today. David also has his own podcast, Rule Breaker Investing, so if you haven't listened to it, you should check it out. And he's here to talk about how to be more productive. This is the last in our series of how to be more blank in 2017. So we did wealthier, healthier, happier and we're going to close it out with more productive. Brokamp: Right. Southwick: So David, thank you for joining us. Gardner: I am honored. Southwick: Well! Brokamp: Your honor is all right. Gardner: Maybe I'll add some value. Southwick: Every time we ask David to be [on the show], I'm always like, "Hey, do you think David...?" You know, "Oh David, will you be on the show?" And he's always like so open helping us out. And I'm always like, "Wow! David said yes! He's got so many other more important things to do." Gardner: I love your podcast. I'm very pleased to be here. Southwick: Oh, thank you! Gardner: And I'm going to try to give shorter answers than I gave with my Amazon answer. Southwick: No, you can talk ... Brokamp: That was an outstanding answer. Southwick: ... you can talk as long as you want. Brokamp: So I'll kick this off just a little bit about why we're talking about productivity with money. In my experience talking to clients -- when I was a financial advisor and when I talk to either members or even Fool employees, which I do as part of my job -- one thing I often hear people say is, "Yeah, I've been meaning to do that, but I haven't gotten around to it." It might be increasing your contributions to a 401(k), opening your college savings account, getting the life insurance, getting an estate plan. There's all these things we know we need to do to get our finances on firmer footing, but we haven't gotten around to it. So as for my own productivity journey, I am biologically, physiologically made to be unproductive. I am distractible, I am scatterbrained, [and] I am a slow reader and writer which is a problem, because it's like 70% of my job. So I did a lot of reading about productivity about a decade about, and I stumbled across a book called Getting Things Done by a guy named David Allen. And that was when I found out that David Gardner, here, also has a mutual admiration for David Allen and actually has had David Allen come to the company a couple of times. So that is why we asked David Gardner to be a part of this show. So welcome, David. Gardner: Thank you, Robert. Brokamp: Would you consider yourself a naturally productive person? Gardner: No, I would not. In fact, it wasn't until probably my early 30s when I first read Getting Things Done, David Allen's book. A lot of people use the acronym GTD. If you're part of the cult, then you already instantly recognize what GTD stands for. It stands for Getting Things Done, David Allen's (I think it was early 2000s) book. Brokamp: Yup. Gardner: So I was desperate to be more productive at that stage. We had three young kids. I was in my early 30s. The Motley Fool was humming. I was doing things like book tours, needing to pick stocks, needing to help run the company, and lots of other things besides. Plus I wanted to have fun. That's a big part of being productive is getting the stuff done that you don't want to do, that you have to do, in order so that you can do what you actually want to do. And in fact, one of the things I try to do these days is free up as much time as possible for myself, so part of being productive is a completely selfish aim to just be able to do the stuff that I want to do in life. Southwick: I actually have not read the book, Getting Things Done, so now I'm feeling like I am not getting enough things done. Can you explain kind of the gist of what he's proposing I do to get things done? Brokamp: Philosophically, the main point is that you need a trusted system to capture all your commitments and responsibilities so that you can free up your brain to be more productive [and] to be more creative, because if you rely on your brain to keep track of everything; first of all, it's not very good at that and second of all, it's going to cause you a lot of angst. Gardner: So there are five steps, really quickly. The first is to capture all the things. Collect what has your attention. Collect. So he even just suggests you sit down with a piece of paper in the morning and for five minutes just anything that pops into your head. Need to pick up Charmin. Also need to let my boss know I'm quitting my job. And by the way, I need to also get to my kid's kindergarten assembly to speak there. Whatever it is. And you just fill that piece of paper. And then you start having collected. Step two is you clarify and process what that means. So you start saying, "OK, well, the following two are when I'm in my car, so I'm going to put that in my When I'm in My Car list. And then my At Work list. And maybe Talk to My Spouse list." And so you start to process those. And then third, you then organize it. OK, I've got Car, Talk to Spouse, and Stuff at Work. And so if you have an extra hour, what are you going to do? The classic GTD answer is the first thing you note is what your context is. Because you can't actually go pick up Charmin at Safeway if you're sitting here in Fool HQ in the studio. So all that really matters, right now, is Fool HQ things for us, or At Work for you, whoever you are if you're at work. And so you would just look at that context. And then the question is how do you pull up that context? I like to use the computer or apps, so I use OmniFocus as a Mac person, myself. OmniFocus is a pretty comprehensive app for doing this. It's not specifically a GTD app. In other words, it's not David Allen's product, but it's people who love what David Allen does and have created a product. There are other "listy" kinds of apps that you can find. You can also use a journal or a yellow legal pad, I guess, but the key is that what I love to do is just immediately filter (drop down list, filter, At Work,) and then see, "OK. Oh, that's right. I need to go talk to Alison and Robert and do the podcast. Or talk to them ahead of time about what we're going to do on the podcast." So you know your context and then you're ready to act within that context. By the way, I don't want to be too comprehensive, here, but just to finish out the five steps, I guess, since I put it out there. So fourth is that you reflect and you review frequently. If you have stuff you need to do, or things you need to say to your partner, make sure you're checking back in with that list. Don't just write it down and then forget to go back to that list -- otherwise you faked yourself out. You externalized it, got it out of your head, but you didn't actually do anything with it. So fifth and final, of course, is just that you do. You engage. You simply do. So to the extent there's a system, here, that's the foundation of the system. But there's a lot more to it. There are tropes and things. Maybe we'll touch on a few of them. There's enough, here, that it fills a really good book. Getting Things Done was a life changer for me. A life improver for me. But we'll do our best to give a few more examples to inspire people. To circle back, Robert, you were saying, you know, that thing. Like I need to do this thing. I need to finally do my finances. You kind of opened with that. My reaction to that is anytime you feel like there's something you need to be getting to and you're not getting to it, the classic David Allen reflection that I've learned is probably you have not determined what your single next action is toward that goal. So you might think, "I've got to get on top of my money to start 2017." Well, that sounds like about 100 different actions probably. What's the actual next action? What's the single next physical action watching the movie of what you need to do to get on top of your finances in 2017? And all that really matters is that next action. That first step up the mountain is the only step that matters when you're at zero steps. So I think determining your next action is like a profound, key productivity enhancer. Brokamp: Right. Another one that I know that you're a big fan of is the Two-Minute Rule. Can you explain that one a little bit? Gardner: It's a great one and this is, again, straight David Allen and you know it, too, Robert. So the Two-Minute Rule is as simple as this. Anytime there's something that you need to do, or somebody asks you to do something, if you can do it literally in 120 seconds or less, do it right then. It might be a quick text. Might be a really quick phone call. Might just be take the garbage out. If it's two minutes literally, or less, just do it. Because a lot of times we don't, and so we add that to a list and then you end up with lists upon lists, and you're not getting stuff done, and you just feel stressed. So it's a great productivity enhancer -- the Two-Minute Rule. And the one caveat to that is it has to be two minutes or less. If it's actually five minutes, then you start to distrust yourself when you think about the Two-Minute Rule. You start saying, "Well, you know, I'm going to do that," and if it takes five minutes, then the next time you think about doing something that will take two minutes or less, you'll start to not do it because you'll be like, "Well, it's more of a pain than I think," because sometimes it's five minutes or six minutes. So literally you have to be kind of hardcore on this, in my experience. Two-Minute Rule -- two minutes or less -- just do it. Brokamp: Got it. There have been times when I've actually tracked my time on a spreadsheet -- how I spend my day in 15-minute increments -- and have been shocked at how much time I spend on email. And here at Motley Fool we use Slack, and even looking at my computer now, I see I have 38 direct messages on Slack. Gardner: You are a popular guy. Southwick: Wow! Brokamp: Well ... Gardner: I've never gotten to 38. Alison? Southwick: Me, neither. No! Gardner: Wow! Brokamp: It's part of this, I think, this new thing that's coming out. But anyways... Gardner: Groupies. Groupies! Southwick: Yeah, I know. Is it? You're kind of bragging a little bit. Gardner: Robert gets stalked around Fool HQ a little bit. Brokamp: Look at the pictures they send me. Southwick: Let me just interrupt you really quick. For those who don't know, Slack is like email. It's kind of replacing email. I always think of it as being like AOL Instant Messenger, where you're kind of like in different chat rooms and direct messaging people. Brokamp: That's exactly what it's like. Southwick: Well, there we go. That's exactly what it's like. OK. Brokamp: So I've tried a couple of things. One is -- and Alison, I think you even saw this on my desk. I have like a piece of paper, and I have Slack, personal email, work email and I can only check it three times a day. And when I've checked it, I have to cross it off and keep track of it. I've also tried to time-block it so that I don't really look at things until noon. But it's very hard to resist looking at your email and Slack, or whatever else you use for messaging, so how do you handle all that? Gardner: I don't think of myself as particularly disciplined, so I'm definitely the shiny thing that moves. And I follow it and do it often. Now, I love that you've mapped your time. That's something that each of us would benefit from. You don't have to do it for a whole week. How about just a single day? How about tomorrow? And just notice, and have insights like that. So for some people, Robert, the equivalent of Slack in their lives is their job. They need to be responsive. They need to be ready. If a quick note comes in from the boss, they need to act. So it kind of comes down to who you are and what you're doing. I guess the way that I've set it up is when things come in to me, generally if I have time, I'll look at them, and if not ... Like here's one thing I did a long time ago, thanks again to David Allen. I turn off the notification that I got an email, whether it's on my computer, like Windows, or something flashes in "an email's come in." Turn those off. The same thing on your phone. Turn off notifications for things that really don't matter. Facebook updates that really don't matter. Emails -- if you're getting spammed all the time -- just turn off all of those kinds of notifications. Make sure you're filtering so that when things come in to you, and you're looking at it, it matters. Brokamp: You brought up time-blocking, and when I look at some of the things that I've tried, one of the most successful things (at least the most helpful things) is when I start the day (and even the week) scheduling certain things. And there are a couple of good books about this. One is Take Back Your Life. Another one is Eat That Frog. Basically a to-do list is unlimited, but your calendar is limited, and if you calendarize your day and work from your calendar and not a to-do list or your inbox, you have a better idea of what you can actually accomplish and what you can actually focus on. Do you ever have something -- maybe you have a project you're working on, something you have to write, something you have to do for someone -- that you put on your calendar as, "I am going to work on this thing for an hour or two hours?" Gardner: So more chapter and verse orthodoxy, David Allen. If you put something on your calendar, you have to. You must respect that and do it. Because again, if you don't, then you'll start faking yourself out. You'll start putting future stuff on your calendar and then you'll also blow those things off. So in the end, how much do you trust yourself? That's fundamentally what this comes down to. You need to create a trusted system and you need to be a figure of trust within that system. So the suggestion from David Allen is if you do put something on your calendar -- which is a formal step -- it's an extra bit of time you just spent to actually put something on your calendar, hardcore stay to that. And if you're not going to, then don't put it on your calendar. Keep it on a to-do list, but don't fake yourself out. Brokamp: Got you. Very good. I've noticed a lot of people who are into, I guess I will say, lifestyle types of books. It could be productivity. It could be all kinds of other things. They often don't have kids. David Allen is one of them. Have you found that you've had to expand your system to include your wife? To include your kids? How have you been able to coordinate everyone else's to-do lists and everyone else's schedules? Gardner: So really important for me is that I have shared calendars with my wife, so that's very helpful so we can see what each other's doing. And if you want to have a little private calendar because you don't want your wife to know that you're setting up a surprise for her birthday ... Southwick: Yes, that is exactly what you're doing. Brokamp: That is the reason you would be doing that. Gardner: ... then you can, but having a shared calendar with the people that matter to you is a real productivity enhancer. Another thing that I think is important is to have ... David Allen talks in terms of 50,000-foot views, 40,000-foot views, etc. So really quickly, down there at zero feet we're on the runway. It's whatever our next action [is] wherever we are right now. We're on the runway. What are we doing? Ten-thousand feet up is actually -- and I'm maybe fudging this a little bit, but you'll get the metaphor -- 10,000-feet up is the projects. Your commitments. So down there on the runway it's just what my next task [is], but Allen defines a project as anything that's more than one task. So just think of all the different projects. In fact, if you ever have kind of a GTD person hired in to coach you (a GTD coach), one of the first things they'll do is get you to list all of your projects. And there's no division between your work life and your family life or any other life. It's all you. And so making sure you understand every single project that you (even if you didn't think of it as a project) [are] committed to mentally. Something you think you're going to do in 2017 -- that's a project -- and so you need to have a full view of that at 10,000 feet. Twenty-thousand feet -- 30, 40, 50 -- these are like, "OK, what's my 2017 goals?" Or, "What are my three-to-five-year goals?" Or at the top, 50,000 feet, why am I here? What is my purpose? What am I actually trying to achieve? And so making sure you spend some time at each of those altitudes -- most of your time you're on the runway -- but making sure you get above that at different points with people that matter [like] your family, spouse or partner. Conversations like that are what keep you, ironically, maybe grounded. Brokamp: Any other particular challenges you have with being productive? Anything that you still struggle with on a regular basis? Gardner: Well, a key feature to, again, orthodox Getting Things Done is that you do a weekly review. And this is probably where most people fall off the wagon. And I have, in a way, fallen off the wagon, but in a way just kind of made it my own. So I guess I've just rationalized falling off the wagon. Brokamp: I didn't like that wagon anyhow. Gardner: And I don't know about you, Robert, because I know you're a GTDer yourself, but the weekly review ... the idea is to block off an hour or so and look over all your projects. So if you have 117 projects, which is probably about how many projects you have, whoever you are, if you actually are honest with yourself and list [them]; then it seems daunting to go over 117 things every week. Now, the truth is you don't need to look over all of the projects. What you do is you look over the next actions for each of the projects. And maybe some of the projects aren't relevant right now, so you could skip that. But the idea is to look back and reengage, recommit, and review all of the commitments that you've made to yourself and others on this weekly basis. And I don't, admittedly. If you watch the movie of me in a given month, I'm not doing weekly reviews. For me, the way that I've made it my own, a little bit, is I think a lot of the time we need to do weekly reviews is because we don't want to deal with stuff. So we're like, "Oh, that's right. I do have to -- taxes are coming. Quarterlies. OK, so I will make sure I'm reviewing that and doing that." But what I've ended up doing to make it my own (and this is a weird, idiosyncratic, geeky admission on my part), and I don't often talk about this, but this is why I come on Motley Fool Answers ... Southwick: To save face. Gardner: ... to save face with Alison and Robert is I randomize a lot. So randomizing, for me, is gamifying life, and I do that a lot. In fact, I read that Tolstoy used to randomize his life decisions. Just cast a die and go off and do it. Brokamp: You're coming back to write a book. I don't know. Gardner: I'm not quite that hardcore, but one of my favorite things to do is have my list of things to do in the day ahead. Start with that in the morning. And instead of being the really disciplined person who tackles the hardest things first (which is, indeed, what we all should be doing), I tend to randomize. So if I have 10 things, I will, with my die app, roll a 10-sided die and it will be like number seven. Great. And there's a weird commitment that I've made that if I roll number seven and number seven is the worst thing (the most wet, prickly thing I don't want to have to do) I literally will do it right then. And so seven, four, one. And by the end of the day I'll try to have all 10 done, but I never [know] what [is] going to come next. Surprises are fun for us... Southwick: Yeah ... Gardner: ... even sometimes if they're bad, so that's how I've made it my own, is I've taken out weekly reviews and I've added in gamification and I get enough stuff done that I feel like it works, but just for me. I'm not putting that out for anybody else to do. Brokamp: That's so funny. Gardner: It's Leo Tolstoy and I, but nobody else. Brokamp: Now I was trying to come up with a definition of productivity, and it basically is focusing on the most important things and getting them done as efficiently as possible. One little mantra I say to myself, sometimes, is "priorities before frivolities." Gardner: I say hard/easy, not easy/hard. I say it to the kids all the time. The same thing. Brokamp: And I thought about it during a little talk you gave to our company in which you told the tale that involved a very big number (86,400) so I thought it would be good if we closed out with that, because it talks about using a limited resource (time) to get important things done. Gardner: So I have a very short passage I'm going to read, and this is not mine. This, like David Allen's system, it's not mine. It's something that I've learned and it's something that I love. So this is from a book called Tie-Ins for Life by Joe Shusko. He is a Marine martial arts instructor. Every U.S. Marine learns martial arts, and those who go through Quantico have learned for the last few decades from Joe Shusko. And one thing he does is he tells the Marines stories that he ties into the lessons that he's giving as he teaches karate chops, or all the different forms of martial arts that they learn. He ties a story in because, of course, that's the best way to learn. So this is a tie-in and it's entitled "86,400 Seconds" and here's how it goes. It starts this way. Imagine there's a bank that credits your account $86,400 every day. It carries no balance and every evening it deletes what you don't use. What would you do with it? Each of us has that bank account. It's called time. Every morning it credits you with 86,400 seconds and every evening it writes off what you don't use. It has no balance. Each day you have a new account. If you fail to use those deposits, you can't go back. Live in the present. Live for today. The clock is running. Make the best of everything you have. Take responsibility for your life. Make a difference. Write down at the end of the day how you've made a difference. Don't watch the world go by. You would spend every penny of the $86,400. Spend the seconds just as well. Brokamp: That's great. Thank you, David, for coming on. Southwick: Yeah. Thank you for putting Motley Fool Answers on your to-do list. We really appreciate it. Gardner: I can't wait for my next appearance, whatever the excuse is to pull me back. Maybe sometime late this summer I'd love that you have me back. Let's talk something else. Southwick: We'll have you back whenever you want. Thank you. Gardner: Thank you for your wonderful podcast. I'm so grateful for you both, and I know you've got a lot of fans and deservedly so. And thank you for Motley Fool Answers. Southwick: Aw! Thank you! Gardner: By the way, the average human heart beats 100,000 times a day. Make every beat count. Southwick: Oh, it's our final episode of There's an App for That. I'm so sad. I've been enjoying you guys coming in and talking about apps. And today we have Mohna Shah, again. She's back. Yay! Mohna Shah: Yay! Thank you. It's nice to be back. Southwick: Yes, it's nice to have you. And, of course she works for Motley Fool, oh, Wealth Management, a sister company of The Motley Fool. And we also have Kara Chambers. She is ... have you been on the show before? Kara Chambers: No, I haven't. Southwick: All right. Kara Chambers works on our people team and she is ... I basically went right to her and I was like, "Kara, can you be on this because you are like a person famous for using apps and productivity tools." So you didn't volunteer. You were volun-told. Chambers: My favorite thing. Southwick: Same for Mohna. So we are going to talk about probably four apps, today, and just to get it out of the way, these are all four apps that we love. So not necessarily some reviews, but here's some recommendations. All right, Mohna. What apps have you brought us today? Shah: So today I wanted to recommend Dropbox and 1Password. It is a way for families to be productive together. One of the inefficiencies about being married or trying to coordinate with your parents is that you want to share documents with them, or be able to give somebody a password in case something happens to you. And those are always the troubling things. Who do you trust? How should we maintain it and then my password changes? And how do I tell them? So for Dropbox, which is a document storage solution in the cloud, my husband and I share an account and you can have separate folders that the other person doesn't see, but you can also share folders ... Southwick: Mohna, what are you putting in that folder that your husband can't see? Shah: It's my birthday gift to him. Brokamp: There you go. There you go. Southwick: We are all so concerned about our spouses' birthdays on this show today. Shah: But one of the things is when you get married and you're sharing insurance, and a mortgage document, etc., it's really hard to have both people keep referencing a paper document in your home. It's much easier to have that available on your phone and both people can share that and access it when they happen to need it, which makes things a lot easier. It's also encrypted, so for people who are concerned about security, there's definitely safety in using the app. The other thing is for people who have aging parents, they might want to be able to have access to their will or other documents that would help them help manage their parents' lives a little bit better, and I think that that's a good way to go, as well, so that you can make sure if something does happen, chaos is reduced and you're able to proceed as you need to. With 1Password, I know that immediately when I got married and we combined our finances, we started using his checking and savings account, which meant that when I called the bank, they wanted me to tell them what my husband's first pet was in order to get by the security clearances and I just thought, "That's really silly. I have no idea." So 1Password is a way in which you can store your passwords for each thing that you have a log in for, as well as put in the notes of what your answers to the security questions are. That way if I have to change a password for our insurance, I can go in, change it in the app. It changes it on his phone and the next time he logs in, he's aware of it. Also it does generate passwords, so we all know we need to keep complex passwords. Not reuse passwords from one thing to the next. And so this is another great way in which you don't have to remember it. Keep it on your phone. Anytime you need to log into something, it's right there at your fingertips. Southwick: Cool! OK, and then so for Dropbox and 1Password, there are both free and paid versions if you want like more bells and whistles and more storage space. Shah: Right. Southwick: All right, cool. All right, Kara. You have brought us a couple of apps today. Pocket? I've never heard of Pocket. Chambers: Pocket is my helpful way of managing all the things to read on the internet. Southwick: Oh! Chambers: One of my favorite bad habits is to just endlessly get lost in reading article after article and Twitter, and you barely read like three sentences and you skip through. Or someone forwards you an interesting article. So Pocket will clean up the interface and save it for you for you to read offline. So what you've got is kind of a nice magazine. And sometimes I'll deliberately put my iPad in airplane mode so I'm not endlessly down that rabbit hole of the internet at the end of the day, and just have got some nice magazine-linked articles. Long reads to read. And you can tag them and hold onto them. They're formatted nicely, so you're not just clicking through a big, long interface. It basically cleans up and organizes the internet for you. So things like The New York Times Sunday magazine always has great articles that I always just miss. So if you're saving something you found on Twitter, or someone at work forwarded you something interesting, just saving it all during the day to Pocket and then having that to read at the end of the day is just a nice compromise between paper books, which are no longer satisfying my attention span. So if you find yourself not with the patience to sit down with a book to read, this is a good interface to just settle down at the end of the day. Southwick: Sure. Own no magazines, yes. Use Pocket. And is this one free, or do you pay for it? Chambers: I believe there's a free and a paid version. Also you can forward emails into Pocket, so if someone sends you an email with an article, you just forward it to Pocket to read later and then find it in your queue at the end of the day. Southwick: Cool. And the next one we're going to talk about is one that we are all fans of... Shah: Yes. Southwick: Trello. Brokamp: Trello. Chambers: Trello pretty much runs the Fool, by now, and most of our lives. Southwick: Between Slack and Trello, that's the only way things get done around here. Chambers: Absolutely. In fact, the new thing is now instead of someone saying to you, "I haven't gotten around to that," say, "it's on my Trello board. It's on my Trello board." So Trello is a to-do list, but it's really beautifully designed based on Agile methodology, which is basically to-do, doing, done and then maybe a waiting column. We've talked about David Allen here, Getting Things Done. Just a simplified look at what I have to do next. But it organizes it in terms of visual cards, and for a lot of people they just find the interface helpful. What I love about a good app is one that adds features time over time. It continues to make it better. And Trello does that. There's a lot of filtering and tagging. You can play around with it to make it beautifully visual. That's also a habit of mine, to just say, "OK, I have this boring meeting, but I'm going to hold up this beautiful organized Trello board and it looks like I've got something done." So you can use it on your own. You can use it in collaboration with others. I was in a team meeting, and I have some teams that people say, "I don't really use Trello. I have my own system." But I can still use Trello to run the meeting, so you can use it at work, but if your workplace doesn't use Trello, it's really helpful to use on your own. You can snap pictures of things and upload them. You can save bookmarks like from Pinterest or something else. You could put your Pocket articles on there and save them, and you can physically move them around. There's an iPad, an iPhone, and a desktop app, and I think what we love about it is it's just so beautifully designed. Southwick: Yeah, it's really rewarding to move like cards to the "Done" column. Or you can have the column be whatever you want, but this show runs on Trello, too. Brokamp: It does, yeah. Southwick: So there we go. 1Password and Dropbox to help you collaborate, get organized, and be more productive with your loved ones. And then Trello to get organized with your projects in a very GTD kind of way. See, I'm using the lingo. Brokamp: That's very impressive. Southwick: Thank you. And then Pocket to help organize all those things you want to read and just save for the end of the day. Yay! Thank you guys for joining us for the final, final version... Oh, for the final. What do I call it? For the final... Brokamp: Installment of our series. Southwick: The final installment of our series, There's an App for That. Which is also your Motley, isn't it Kara? Chambers: Yes, it is. Every Fool has a Motley. We have our own little phrase or saying and I picked that one because I like to look at new technology for the Fool all the time. Southwick: And that's why I dragged you in here. Chambers: Anytime. I could talk about apps all day. Southwick: Thank you, guys. Chambers: All right, thank you. Shah: Thank you. Southwick: All right, that's the show. I want to thank David Gardner for joining us, as well as Mohna Shah and Kara Chambers. We really couldn't do this show without the whole village. Brokamp: We could not. Southwick: We've received a ton of postcards over the holidays from exotic places. Brokamp: Wow! Southwick: I know. We got one from Cody, who works for UNICEF in the Sudan. Bruno in Rio, Patrick from the Grand Canyon, Brent who is stationed in Kuwait, and Dan and Beth who went to Caneel Bay. And I am peanut butter and jealous over that one. It's gorgeous. Ugh! Well, you guys all live such exciting lives. Brokamp: And if we haven't said this already, we hang all those up. They don't go into a pile. Everyone can see these postcards. Southwick: Because we're very proud of them -- that our listeners are so cool. Yee! All right, so our email is Answers@Fool.com. Remember how we set up that phone number for people to leave a question and a message? And then I forgot to go and check the box? Brokamp: There's like a hundred. Southwick: No, there's not a hundred, but I feel bad because people left some questions over our voice mail and I forgot to circle back. But not anymore, because it's going on my GTD list ... Brokamp: There you go. Southwick: So yes. Please send us your questions to Answers@Fool.com or you can call and leave a voice mail at 1-800-MRSFOOL. All right.

Mary Chamberlain and Smith also are members of the Crossroads Through Time steering committee. (Carie Canterbury / Daily Record) Click photo to enlarge This is how the Stegosaurus looked when it first arrived at PCC - Fremont Campus in October 2014 from its location near Walmart on land managed by the Chamber of Commerce. « 1 2 » The Stegosaurus at Pueblo Community College - Fremont Campus has undergone one final transformation. The Fremont County Historical Society recently donated $500 toward its refurbishment and painting, which was carried out by Vaughn Chamberlain and completed earlier this month. Chamberlain built up the giant dinosaur's legs and used bedliner for the skin to give it a more realistic looking texture. Located at the Crossroads Through Time - Geology Time Trail, the project took about a year and a half to complete, Chamberlain said, adding that during that time, he had two knee surgeries. "It was a lot of fun, but I was glad when it was over," he said. The creature stands 23 feet tall, 43 feet long and weighs 7 tons. Cindy Smith said the Crossroads Through Time steering committee appreciates the contribution that made the project possible. The Stegosaurus first arrived at PCC in October 2014 from its location near Walmart on land managed by the Chamber of Commerce. It originally was constructed by the Department of Corrections in 1995. The Stegosaurus is one piece of the Crossroads Through Time project, which aims to educate the public on the region's rich paleontological, geological and historical heritage. Along with the historical society, the Greater Denver Gem and Mineral Council and the Western Interior Paleontological Society of Denver have contributed financially toward the project. Advertisement Volunteers completed laying fabric and fines for the Geology Time Trail in September 2016, completing the final 1,100 feet of the 2,300-foot trail, which adjoins the Riverwalk on the campus. There also are stone benches for seating. Smith said next steps in the project include adding more boulders and an outdoor amphitheater and continuing to work on signage.

Andrew Purdum, 28, allegedly hit Jonathan Tanner with a truck in the Elkins Walmart parking lot at approximately 2:14 a.m., according to the Randolph County Sheriff's Office. When deputies responded to the parking lot, they found Tanner lying on the ground bleeding from his head and mouth, deputies said.  Tanner was unable to provide the deputy with any information due to his injuries, according to court documents. Several witnesses watched the incident take place, deputies said.  A woman who was with Tanner at the time of the incident told deputies that Purdum said it was okay to borrow the truck, get gas, and stop at Walmart.  The woman said she was driving and leaving Walmart when Purdum came out of nowhere in a black car and began beating on the truck.  The woman said she put the truck in park, and Purdum pulled Tanner out of the passenger seat.  The woman told deputies Tanner ran, before Purdum came around to the driver's seat, pulled her out, and jumped in the truck, deputies said.  Deputies reviewed video footage of the incident that a witness took.  A deputy said he saw Tanner running from the truck while Purdum made a quick U-turn in the parking lot and proceeded to chase Tanner. Purdum missed on his first attempt to strike Tanner, but he accelerated at a high-rate of speed and struck him on the second attempt, deputies said.  Purdum then left the area. Purdum is charged with malicious assault.

The board in fiscal 2017 had a median age of 54, down from 65 in fiscal 2015, according to the retailer’s Proxy filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Board Vice Chairman Rob Walton is the only director older than 70. Four directors are under 50 years old, which is what has brought down the median age. Seven of the 11 director nominees are under 60 years old, and four of those are under 50. The Proxy shows the Bentonville-based global retailer has reduced the board size from 15 members three years ago to 11 in the recent year. With the leaner structure the board also split its compensation, nominating and governance committees into two groups. One of those committees will focus on executive compensation and management development, and the other is focused on director nominations and corporate governance, according to the Proxy. “This new structure allows greater focus on aligning our compensation and performance management programs with our strategy, as well as emphasizing our continuing commitment to board refreshment and succession planning. To further this commitment, beginning in fiscal 2018, our independent compensation committee approved important changes to our executive compensation program to ensure that it continues to support our strategy as we transform our business,” the company noted in the filing. DIRECTOR SLATE The smaller board of 11 includes 7 independent directors and two female nominees. The spots held by females are down from four in 2015 when the board was larger. Linda Wolf is retiring as a director, a position she has held since 2005. The nominee to fill Wolf’s seat is Carla Harris. Shareholders are asked to elect a slate of 11 directors at the retailer’s upcoming annual Shareholder Meeting slated for June 2. Board leadership also asked shareholders to reject three shareholder proposals brought by interest groups and to approve a nonbinding advisory resolution to approve the compensation of the retailer’s named executive officers. “We are committed to an independent and robust Board and to thoughtful and effective Board refreshment, and have added 7 new directors in the past 5 years. This year, we are excited to announce Carla Harris as a new director nominee. Carla brings deep experience in capital markets and global finance, and I’m confident she will be an asset to the Board and to Walmart,” Board chairman Greg Penner noted in the Proxy. He said the proposed board for the new year has a broad mix of experience, skills, and backgrounds which is a strategic asset for the company. Four of the proposed directors have less than three years on the Board. Three have spent between four and six years as a director, two have between seven and 10 years, and two have more than 10 years. The retailer has a 12-year term limit for independent directors. Lead independent director James Cash will reach that milestone after this year. Wal-Mart has a generous payment structure for its directors which has a base compensation valued at $175,000 paid in shares and an annual cash retainer of $90,000. There are additional fees earned for leadership roles. Penner, as non-executive chairman earned $200,000 with payment split evenly between shares and cash. Following are payments received by Wal-Mart’s director’s last year. • Alda Alvarez, (retiring): $62,510 • James Cash Jr.: $363,915 • Roger Corbett: $76,488 • Pamela Craig: $319,047 • Mike Duke, retired: $38,567 • Timothy Flynn: $383,364 • Thomas Horton: $317,561 • Marissa Mayer: $266,808 • Greg Penner: $468,976 • Steven Reinemund: $289,787 • Kevin Systrom: $288,978 • Jim Walton (retiring): $45,903 • Rob Walton: $268,978 • Steuart Walton: $226,901 Wal-Mart Stores CEO Doug McMillon said given the company’s ongoing investigation related to alleged violations of the Federal Corruption Practices Act a number of directors have spent more time on corporate governance issues which drove up their compensation. Flynn, Horton and Cash comprised the audit committee who met 12 times last year and had oversight of the FCPA internal investigation. The other committees met between one and six times last year. The Board met five times last year as a group. The company said its directors attended 98% of the meetings of the group and their respective committees. Nine out 10 nominees for this year had perfect attendance, according to the filing. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS The company also noted several related party transactions. Following are some of those. On Sept. 19, 2016 Wal-Mart acquired Jet.com with Jet becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of the retailer. Marc Lore, founder of Jet, received $477 million in cash for his interest in Jet. Of this amount, approximately $80 million was paid following the closing of the transaction. The remaining approximately $397 million will be paid to Mr. Lore over the five year period following the closing date of the transaction, subject to Mr. Lore remaining employed by Wal-Mart during such period. If Wal-Mart terminates Lore’s employment without cause, or if he resigns for good reason, Lore will continue to receive the payments over the five year period following the closing date of the transaction. His equity payment consisted of restricted stock units for 3,554,093 shares of Walmart stock vesting over the five year period following the closing date of the transaction, subject to his continued employment during such period as further discussed. Wal-Mart also does business ($350,000 annually) with Some Spider Inc., an internet marketing company in which Lore is a minority owner (20%). The retailer said it cannot estimate the dollar value the Lore benefits from this association. McMillon has several relatives employed at the retailer’s corporate offices and with vendors with which do business with Wal-Mart. Lori Haynie, his sister, works for Mahco, which did about $21 million of business with Wal-Mart last year. The retailer said it plans to purchase similar sporting goods products from Mahco this year. McMillon’s brother-in-law, Greg Bray, is employed as management in the retailer’s finance department. Bray earned total compensation of more than $361,500 last year. This year he may receive compensation and other benefits in amounts similar to or greater than those he received during fiscal 2017. Nichole Bray, a management associate in the company’s Information Systems Division, is the sister-in-law to McMillon, Last year she earned $229,400 in total compensation. Her pay should be similar for this year as long as she remains employed. Arvest Bank, owned by Jim Walton and other members of the Walton family made payments of $310,000 to Wal-Mart last year for leased space in stores where it runs bank branches. For this year the company said banking leases to Arvest should generate about $220,000 for Wal-Mart. These leases are not awarded on a competitive-bid basis. Jim Walton is the father of director Steuart Walton. NON-COMPANY SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS • Proposal No. 5 Requests the board to adopt an independent chairman. The proposal said the policy should be implemented without violating any contractual obligation and compliance could be excused if not independent director is available or willing to be chairman. The Wal-Mart board asked shareholders to vote against this proposal saying its independent directors chair all the governance committees. • Proposal No. 6 Requests the board extend Proxy access to shareholders so they have access to nominate board candidates of their own choosing. The Wal-Mart board is also against this proposal. • Proposal No. 7 Asks the board to consider appointing an Independent director with environmental expertise. The Wal-Mart board opposes the proposal. “Our Board currently has one member with significant expertise in environmental issues. Rob Walton, retired Chairman of the Board, currently serves as the chair of the executive committee of the board of directors of Conservation International, and he is also the co-chair of the Arizona State University Global Institute of Sustainability,” noted the Proxy.

As we age, we have to adapt -- here’s how. Alison Southwick and Robert Brokamp, CFP (TMFAlison) Apr 25, 2017 at 1:30PM In this episode of Motley Fool Answers, Alison Southwick and Robert Brokamp talk about the many different priorities we will have throughout our financial lives. From our vibrant 20s to our golden years, financial goals and needs will naturally shift. For the best advice for every decade (the important mistakes to avoid) -- the Motley Fool has you covered. A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on April 18, 2017 Alison Southwick: This is Motley Fool Answers. I'm Alison Southwick and I'm joined, as always, by Robert Brokamp, personal finance expert here at the Motley Fool. Robert Brokamp: Well, hello Alison. Southwick: Well, hello there. We're going to take our listeners on a wonderful journey through time and give you your financial priorities for every decade of your life. We're also going to answer your question about avoiding dividend stocks because of taxes. Should you? I don't know! Let's ask Bro. All that and more on this week's episode of Motley Fool Answers. __ Southwick: It's time for [Answers, Answers] and today's question comes from Anna from Twitter. She writes: "I'm 10 to 20 years away from retirement. Should I avoid dividend stocks in order to avoid the income tax?" Brokamp: Well, that's an interesting question, Anna. I would say if you're going to avoid dividend payers, the problem, there, is you're actually going to have to ignore most of the market, because most stocks actually do pay dividends. Also several studies have shown that as a group, dividend payers outperform non-payers over the long term, although that can change depending on the time frame you look at, like during the '90s. During the boom-boom years, it was actually better to have non-dividend payers. But, of course, that all changed. All those non-dividend payers didn't turn out so well in the 2000s. But I will give you a real-life example of investing in a dividend payer outside of an IRA, because I just came across this when I did my taxes. So 20 years ago, when I was but a wee little Bro, or at least a ... Southwick: Aw! Baby Bro! Brokamp: ... a Bro with less hair. As a poor teacher ... Southwick: Bro with probably more hair, actually. Brokamp: Well, maybe more hair is what I meant to say. So as a poor teacher I was about to leave teaching to go to grad school, so I was not investing a whole lot. But I found out that Home Depot had what is called a direct stock purchase plan, or a dividend reinvestment plan. You can send the money directly to the company (so you didn't have to have a brokerage account [and] you didn't need a broker), and the minimum was $500. So this is 1996, 1997. I sent them $500. Well, because it's not in my brokerage account, I also forget about it until tax time rolls around [and] they tell me how much I owe in taxes based on the dividends they paid me. So this morning I looked [at how much that is] worth now, because I really hadn't been paying attention. So $500 back in like 1996, 1997 today is worth more than $6,000. Southwick: Oh! Brokamp: Because the stock price has gone up [and] because I've been reinvesting the dividends to buy more shares and those dividends are growing. I don't have the information from when I first bought it, but I do have the information from the end of the year 2000. Back then, I had 29 shares and each share paid a quarterly dividend at the end of 2000 of $0.04 per share. Now I have over 40 shares and each dividend -- the last quarter's dividend -- was $0.89, so it's gone up from $0.04 to $0.89. That's all good, but [Anna] brings up a good point, and that is while this has been growing, I have been paying taxes on the dividend ... Southwick: Even though you've reinvested them, you still have to pay taxes on them. Brokamp: Exactly. Southwick: Ach! Brokamp: That's a very good point. So if you're going to invest in dividend-paying stocks and you are also going to invest in non-payers, ideally keep the dividend payers in your IRA and 401(k). Use your regular, taxable brokerage for the non-payers, but don't not invest in a good stock just because it pays a dividend and you have to have it in a taxable brokerage account. __ Southwick: [Chorus from "Video Killed the Radio Star" sung by The Buggles] You're listening to WFOL Radio. We're playing the greatest hits from your decade, no matter how old you are. We've got the tunes and the financial advice that will be music to your ears. I can't keep doing that! In today's episode, Bro is going to offer up the best advice for every decade of your life. What should be your top priority in your 20s? How much should you have saved by your 40s? And what is the biggest mistake to avoid in your 50s? Bro, we're going to do all that. We're going to actually take people all the way into post-retirement. Brokamp: That's true. Southwick: So let's start with our listeners in their 20s. Your 20s are an exciting time. You're starting to adult, you're shopping at IKEA, and you're thinking maybe you should maybe, at some point maybe kind of a little bit, start thinking about your finances some more. Brokamp: Maybe a little bit. The very first thing you should think about, because I'm the retirement guy at the Fool, is saving for your retirement, and if you start in your 20s you should be shooting for maybe 10% if not 15% of your income. That is how much you contribute to your accounts and you can throw in your employer match, as well. So if you're contributing 10% and the match is 5%, then you've hit that 15%. If you wait until you're in like your mid-30s to start saving for retirement, then you have to start targeting like 15% to 25%, so starting soon is definitely better. The other thing you want to focus on in your 20s is paying off debt. Many people graduate with student loans. They might have gotten those credit cards in college that came with a free t-shirt and then maybe used them a little too much, so you want to focus on paying down that debt. And one of the best things about paying off that debt is you will start building your credit score, and that is a third priority of your 20s. We've talked about this in previous episodes. Your credit score will determine so much about your financial life: whether you can get a loan, the interest rate on a loan, insurance rates, employers, and all types of things. So this is a time when you want to focus on building a great credit score and the most important thing about your credit score is basically making your payments on time. Southwick: All right. How much money should you have saved for retirement in your 20s? Brokamp: [For] the average person in their mid-20s, the average income in the U.S. is anywhere between $30,000 and $40,000. It's not a lot, [but] basically as long as you're starting, that's good. You want to target to have at least about half of your income in retirement accounts by the time you get to your 30s. Southwick: And then what about a mistake to avoid? What's the number one mistake to avoid in your 20s? Brokamp: I would say the biggest mistake is getting married too soon. When you look at divorce statistics, according to the Department of Labor, people who get married between the ages of 15 and 22 ... Southwick: Yes, that's rough. Brokamp: ... the divorce rate is 58%. You wait until between 23 and 28, it is closer to 43%. Once you make it into your 30s or so, it's 36%. So I think the longer you wait, the better your odds that you will stay married. Why is that good for your finances? Well, divorce is very expensive. It can cost anywhere from a few hundred dollars to tens of thousands. The average is around $10,000 to $15,000. You have to split up all your assets, and of course there's an emotional toll. So one mistake I think people should avoid is wait until you are absolutely convinced you have found the right person to marry. Southwick: Let's head back on over to WFOL radio. And if you're in your 20s, then you might remember this song that was burning up the charts. It's the official song of summer for 2010. [Chorus from "California Gurls" sung by Katy Perry and Snoop Dogg] Your 30s are an exciting time. You're hitting all the major milestones. Marriage, home ownership, kids, and a career. You're making a lot of decisions and because of those aforementioned kids, probably on very little sleep. Brokamp: So true. Southwick: So what should be your priorities in your 30s? Brokamp: Well, you touched on it there. Number one is really your career, and that is being very strategic about your career. Your job is going to determine so much about your finances. Your income. Your benefits. Your retirement. The quality of your 401(k) and whether you have a pension will be a big factor in your retirement savings. And even, of course, your happiness. So you want to make sure you have a job that you enjoy, but I think it's very important to be strategic about it and to continually come up with ways to make yourself more valuable to your employer, to your colleagues, and to your customers. Number two is to arrange your finances for a family. That has several aspects. First of all, it's a slightly bigger emergency fund. It's time to get life insurance. You probably haven't thought about that, but once you have kids you really need to get life insurance. It's also time to finally get an estate plan. The majority of people in America don't. According to a Gallup poll last year, only 44% of Americans have a will. But once you have kids, you need to set up your finances in a way to take care of them in case something happens to you. And then the third priority in your 30s is to maybe buy a house. Southwick: Maybe? Brokamp: We've talked before about how it's maybe not the best thing in the world, but most people do, especially once they have a family. Just keep in mind that you want to be buying a house you're going to be happy with for at least six years and ideally a decade. Southwick: And how much should you have saved for retirement in your 30s? Brokamp: Once you're at around 30, you want to be aiming for about one-half of your household income. By the time you're in your mid-30s, you want to have about one to two times your household income stashed away in your 401(k)s and your IRAs. You can also add other things to that. Maybe employee stock if you receive it. Maybe home equity if you plan to downsize when you retire. But for the most part you're really just looking at how much money you've saved in your retirement accounts. Southwick: And what's the biggest mistake to avoid in your 30s? Brokamp: I would say buying too much car and replacing it too soon. Remember when we're all in our 20s, we're driving a piece of junk. And finally once we're in our 30s, we have a little bit of money. We decide to buy a car. Maybe we buy too much of a car, or too nice of a car, and we sell it too soon. According to IHS Automotive, the average new car purchased [is kept] for about 6.6 years, which is actually longer than it used to be. So people are getting this message, but the average life span of a car that's on the road, now, is almost 12 years. In other words, they could keep that car longer, but they choose not to. But you think of even just putting off a new car purchase a year what the average monthly payment is now -- between $400 and $500 --and that's several thousand dollars more you can save just by keeping that car for another year. Southwick: Back to the radio, shall we? If you're in your 30s, you may remember getting motion sick and throwing up in your favorite yellow sweatshirt at the theater during The Blair Witch Project. Oh, it's so jerky, that camera action. I know. I sure do. You might also remember the song of summer for 1999. Yeah, it's that "Genie in a Bottle". [Chorus from "Genie in a Bottle" sung by Christina Aguilera] Your 40s are an exciting time. Your kids are so busy with school and their friends that it gives you time to get to know you again. You'll do things like start a Styx cover band with your neighbors, and you'll lie to yourself and your friends that it's actually cool to drive a minivan. And it's practical, too, because of all those guitars and amps you'll have to haul around to open mic nights one day. Does that sound like your 40s, guys? Rush! Sorry. It's a Rush cover band. Brokamp: No, Styx. Actually I was a big Styx fan before I was a big Rush fan. Rick Engdahl: I just don't have time to practice my guitars. Brokamp: Both of those work. Because Easter is coming up, at this point [my wife and I] we get the kids more little gifts than candy, and I got Styx' "Mr. Roboto" in eighth grade. My Easter basket. I still remember this many years later. Southwick: Because it was the coolest thing ever. Brokamp: Because it was the coolest thing ever. So 40s, three priorities. You want to be super saving for your retirement. And most people hit their peak earning years in their late 40s, early 50s. From the point from your 20s to your 40s, your income probably went up pretty significantly because you were climbing the corporate ladder. It starts to level off once you reach your late 40s, early 50s. You're about at where you're going to be, so you want to take advantage of that as much as possible. That's number one. Number two is start planning for how you'll pay for college for the kids, and that means, of course, saving, but also arranging your finances to a certain degree for financial aid. You don't want to wait until the year before they go to college. You want to start doing that a good three years [in advance]. So if your kid is a sophomore in high school, you need to start thinking about arranging your finances for financial aid. And actually, even a freshman in high school is a better way to do that. And then number three is to update your estate plan, which includes your life insurance. If you got your will and your life insurance back in your 30s when you first had kids and had your first house and all that stuff, a lot has changed since then. You might have had more kids. You've accumulated more assets. You probably own things that are not incorporated into your will. You're also earning more money, so you might need more life insurance. Now's the time of life to do that. Southwick: And how much should you have saved for retirement in your 40s? Brokamp: By the time you reach 40, ideally two to three times your household income. By your mid-40s you'll want to be around four times. Southwick: Whoa! Brokamp: Yes. Southwick: Things accelerate. Brokamp: And of course there's a lot of variation on this. It depends on your own situation. It depends on your income. It depends on whether you'll get a traditional pension or not. So these are rough guidelines, but they're good road signs along the way of whether you're roughly on track or not. Southwick: And what's a big mistake to avoid in your 40s? Brokamp: I would say actually spending too much on kids, as we've talked about. There was a good article in The Wall Street Journal last year about mistakes to avoid and it quoted a financial planner at Compass Planning Associates in Boston. Her name is Jennifer Lane. She recommends that parents pay no more than 10% of income on expenses related to kids. I'd never heard that guideline before, but I liked it. She also said that giving kids allowances actually helps keep costs down. Her quote was: "They'll choose not to spend when it's their money versus your money," which I thought was pretty good. So it's very difficult. You want to give your kids all that they want. You want to send them to camps. You want to get them whatever when it comes to clothes, and toys, or even college (the situation I'm in with my kids right now). We've looked at two colleges so far this year. One was UVA as a Virginia resident. One was Duke. There's about a $40,000 a year difference between those two schools. Southwick: Yeah, so I know where you're leaning. Brokamp: Right. But you just have to put it in the context of your own finances. You don't want to compromise your own financial security because if you don't take care of your own financial security, if you don't take care of your own retirement, it's going to fall back on your kids at some point. Southwick: Let's head back to the radio. If you're in your 40s, you also remember this iconic song from 1986, because the video pretty much blew everyone's mind and aired 100 times a day on MTV. Wubba wubba wubba! [Chorus from "Sledgehammer" sung by Peter Gabriel] Your 50s are an exciting time. You're reaching cruising altitude in your career. The kids, who also work in your office, perplex you, but that's fine if they think you're the old, wise one in the office because you've learned the coolest thing you can do in life is not care what other people think about you. I'm looking forward to my 50s, I think, for that reason. So what should be your priorities in your 50s? Brokamp: Well, it's the time to do some great retirement saving. Southwick: I said it was an exciting time. Brokamp: So take advantage of the higher retirement account contribution limits. For example, this year if you are not 50 and older, you can only contribute $18,000 to a 401(k) or $5,500 to an IRA. But if you're 50 or older, you can put an extra $6,000 into the 401(k) and an extra $1,000 in the IRA. So take advantage of that. Number two is take advantage of the extra money you have since the kids are out of college and out of the house. I've talked to many subscribers to my Rule Your Retirement service about how surprised they were at how much money they had once the kids were gone. But the problem is some people then use that money to buy a second house, or a boat, or something. And if you're behind in your retirement savings, what you should be doing is really getting it into your retirement accounts. And number three, take a good hard look at your retirement projections. I'm a big fan of retirement calculators, but honestly if you're using them in your 20s and 30s (and maybe even your 40s), there's so many variables that you have to guess at they're probably not going to be totally accurate. But once you're in your 50s, you really have to start looking at whether you're on track and a good retirement calculator can actually get a relatively accurate projection of whether you're headed in the right direction. Southwick: And how much should you have saved? Brokamp: Around age 50, maybe five to six times your household income. Once you're in your mid-50s, you really want to be 6 to 7 times. Southwick: And what's a mistake to avoid? Brokamp: I would say ignoring debt. One trend that we've seen over the last few decades is people entering retirement with more debt. So according to the Federal Reserve, back in 1989, only 11% of people in the 65 to 74 age group had a mortgage. Back in 2013, that was 43%. So almost half of people 65 and older having a mortgage. I've talked before on previous episodes how I think it's a great idea to go into retirement without a mortgage or car loans, or any other kind of debt because it lowers your expenses. You don't have to take so much out of your retirement account once you get into your 50s, especially when you're supposed to be playing it a little safer with your portfolio. The safe investments these days are cash and bonds, which no one likes. Use some of that money that would be considered "safe money" to pay down debt. Southwick: If you're in your 50s, all I have to say is "epic sax solo", and you'll know what I'm talking about. It's this hit from 1978. [Sax solo and chorus from "Baker Street" sung by Gerry Rafferty] Your 60s are an exciting time. These are the years where you transition out of being a workaday Joe and it gives you time to, you know what? Get to know you again. Again! You and your neighbors try to get a Troggs cover band together and end up playing Friday nights at the country club. Not bad! So what should be your top money priorities in your 60s? Brokamp: So we're thinking, here, in terms of the early 60s. Obviously it's time to get ready for retirement. What that means is really learning a lot about Social Security and Medicare, because these are two programs that are going to have a big influence on the quality of your retirement. Number two is to learn how to turn your portfolio into an income-generating machine. Up until now you've been spending decades learning how to accumulate money, but it's a little different in terms of using a portfolio to generate income. It might be the first time in your life that you've ever actually looked at bonds, for example. So learn about how to make your portfolio generate income. Number three, I would also say it might be time to visit a fee-only financial planner. You might have had a financial planner all along, but if you never have, this is such an important transition with so many moving parts. It's time to get a good, qualified second opinion on when you actually can retire. And you want to get someone who provides holistic advice. A lot of people who call themselves financial advisors just really provide advice about your portfolio, but don't really know that much about Social Security, Medicare, and things like that. You want to get a good, fee-only, comprehensive financial planner. Southwick: How much should you have saved for retirement in your 60s? Brokamp: By age 60 you want to be shooting for eight to 10 times your household income. Southwick: And what's a good mistake to avoid? Brokamp: Retiring too soon. A lot of people retire just because, for example, they're eligible for Social Security at age 62. They think, "Well, I can take it now. Why shouldn't I retire?" But that doesn't mean that really all their finances are ready for retirement. We're all aware that many of the studies indicate most people aren't prepared, but if you look at what people can do to improve their chances of having a secure retirement, it basically means retiring closer to age 70. It's more years of contributing to your accounts. More years of them growing without you touching them and years of maximizing Social Security by putting it off to age 70. If you think of everyone retiring at age 70 in this country, the vast majority of people are actually pretty prepared for retirement. Southwick: All right, let's head on over to the AM dial. Does that still exist? Brokamp: It does! Southwick: Great. If you're in your 60s, you'll probably remember this classic that is so saccharine sweet you'll get a stomach ache. [Chorus from "Cherish" sung by The Association] Our 70s and beyond are an exciting time. Your years of saving and planning are paying off. You get to volunteer your time, travel, and spoil grandchildren. Sure, your body aches a bit and you've got some sunspots and some laugh lines around your mouth, but they are all signs of a life well lived. So what should be your priorities in retirement? Brokamp: Number one, you want to ensure your portfolio will last as long as you do, and that is understanding safe withdrawal rates in retirement, which is one of my favorite topics. Southwick: Yeah. I know. Brokamp: You know. And most people think of 4%. That's a classic rule of thumb, and it's a fine rule of thumb, but most people should be taking out either a little bit more or a little bit less depending on your circumstances starting, for example, with your age. The studies that determine that 4% safe withdrawal rate assume you'll retire at age 65. But what if you're 55? What if you're 75? You really need to learn about how all that goes. I would recommend the three people to read to learn about this type of stuff is David Blanchett at Morningstar, Michael Kitces, and Wade Pfau. If you want to learn a lot about safe withdrawal rates in retirement, go check out those guys. Number two, you want to learn how to sell investments in a tax-efficient manner. You're now in this situation where you are selling assets to generate income. One rule of thumb is if you have a taxable account, a traditional tax-deferred account, and a Roth; you drain your taxable account first, then the traditional account, and then the Roth. It depends on your circumstances because it might be better to touch the Roth a little bit sooner to avoid huge withdrawals from traditional accounts when you have to take money out at age 70 1/2. So there's some stuff to learn about that, but there are lots of ways to reduce the tax bill on how you turn your portfolio into an income-generating machine. And then the third one is managing healthcare costs. For retirees, most of their expenses actually go down as they get older. The one exception is healthcare. So for someone who's 65, on average they spend about 10% of their budget on healthcare. Eighty-five year olds spend about 20%. Of course, you first want to make sure you're taking care of yourself so you don't have to spend so much on healthcare. But then understanding the healthcare system, Medicare, and all that so you can manage those costs as well as possible. Southwick: And how much should you have saved once you're in retirement? All of it? One hundred percent? Brokamp: As a good rule of thumb, you should have 12 times your annual income before you retire. And then beyond that it depends on your age, but 12 is a good rule of thumb. If you have a lower income, or a lot of your income will be provided by Social Security and a pension, you can have less. If you had a higher income throughout your life, Social Security is not going to replace as much of that, so you might need something like 14 times your income before you retire. Southwick: All right, and this is a tough question, but what do you think is one of the biggest mistakes to avoid in your retirement? Brokamp: I would say not preparing for changes in your ability and availability to handle your finances. And what I mean by that is as we get older we may not be as sharp as we used to be. A month ago we had a [professor from Georgetown] by the name of Dr. Sumit Agarwal [talking about behavioral finance]. In one of his studies he concluded that our peak age for making financial decisions is 53. It turns out that our raw intellectual power (our IQ) peaks pretty early in life, like in our 20s, but it's compensated by wisdom and experiential learning. Once we hit age 53, that might be the peak, and for some people it goes down considerably to a point where as many as half of people in their 80s and 90s have some sort of cognitive difficulty handling their finances. Not everyone. Warren Buffett's in his 80s and he's doing just fine. But you have to prepare for that possibility. That means getting your estate plan set up and thinking about who's going to handle your finances if either you're mentally not able to do it or if you're the person in this married couple that handles the finances and you die before your spouse. It could be one of your kids that you trust, or it could be you start a relationship with a good financial planner who can handle that for you later in life. Southwick: We'll trot over to WFOL one more time before signing off for the day. If you're in your 70s or in retirement and took a Motley approach to your finances, you're no poor little fool like the one in this summer hit from 1958 by Ricky Nelson. [Chorus from "Poor Little Fool" sung by Ricky Nelson] This was fun! Brokamp: It was fun. So nostalgic. Southwick: Any time we can music work into a show, I get excited because I love music. It's funny how all of these songs that were like the big summer songs or the big songs of the year -- a lot of them didn't really last that long. Like there weren't a lot of Beatles songs and stuff like that. It's kind of weird. Whatever. Engdahl: People are fickle. Southwick: I guess so. So that's the show. I don't have any postcards to talk about this week. Womp womp. I will tell you that this show is edited nostalgically by Rick Engdahl. Our email is Answers@Fool.com.

Alexander Santiesteban-Criado, a Cuban citizen and lawful U.S. permanent resident, was sentenced Monday, April 24, by U.S. District Judge Janet Neff. She ordered Santiesteban-Criado to spend two years on supervised release after his prison sentence ends and to pay $39,239 in restitution. He is the last of four to be sentenced in this case. Daniel Hernandez Perez was sentenced to 45 months in prison while Lixandra Gelaber Matos was sentenced to 46 months. Both are Cuban citizens in the U.S. under parole. They were ordered to pay $218,000 in restitution. Yume Ubmit Martinez-Orta, also a Cuban citizen and permanent U.S. resident, was sentenced to five days in prison, with credit for time served, for withholding information on a crime. She was ordered to pay $39,000 in restitution. The four were arrested last year in Kent County. They were part of a Texas-based scheme in which credit cards were re-encoded with stolen credit-card numbers to buy gift cards and purchases at retailers such as Sam's Club and Walmart, the government said. 'Bricks of $100 bills:' Credit-card scheme at Sam's Club brings prison The FBI said the defendants hit Sam's Club stores in Alpine Township, Cascade Township, Holland, Lansing and Muskegon. Sheriff's deputies responding to a disturbance last July at the Cascade Township Motel 6 discovered evidence of the crime: wrappers for seven $200 gift cards, and later, after getting consent to search a suspect's room, a credit-card reader/writer device used to put stolen account numbers on blank or depleted cards. The cards would then be used to buy gift cards or merchandise. In all, the group used 87 account numbers over the course of four days in June to obtain $40,167, the FBI said. Assistant U.S. Attorney Hagen Frank said investigators found images on Santiesteban-Criado's phone showed him holding bricks of $100 bills, and posing in front of a bed covered with $50 bills. He was wearing an "absurd amount of heavy gold and diamond-encrusted jewelry, Frank wrote. Suspects tied to $300K credit-card scheme at Walmart, Sam's Club, FBI says Defense attorney Keith Turpel suspected that his client was a "favored and pampered child naive in many ways," and did not appreciate the seriousness of his crimes. Santiesteban-Criado came to the U.S. for a better life but didn't realize how difficult it would be to find a job. "He surrendered to a fellow Cuban's pitch for money and fun, the defense contends, and enjoyed being a 'player' for a period of time, even posing with jewelry and money that was not his," Turpel said. "It was an intoxicating life while it lasted. He is embarrassed by what he did and ashamed to the point that he does not want to disclose his involvement to his father for fear that it would kill him.

See below for a new member sign-up bonus and ways to earn more SB points so you can earn even more gift cards! Snack Code Extravaganza The Extravaganza begins on Wednesday, April 26 at 10 am ET and lasts until 8 pm. There will be 6 Swag Codes throughout the day worth a total of 40 SB! The first code should be released on Wednesday at 10 am ET. Each code is valid for 1 hour after it is released. New codes are usually released every 2 hours. When each code becomes available, we will post the codes in the comments section for this post so you can find them easily. Once you see the code, just copy and paste it into the Swag Code box on their website, the SwagButton on your desktop or on their Mobile App. New to Swagbucks? If you don't know about Swagbucks yet, it's the largest rewards website that gives people free gift cards for the things they do online (searching, shopping, watching videos, playing games and more).

Make sure you use all caps since it is case sensitive. How do you get these SB points? There are lots of ways. * Search online: Each time you need to search for something online, use the Swagbucks search engine on their website (instead of Google). I actually have the Swagbucks toolbar installed on my desktop and it places a search box right on my screen making it super easy to search. Every once in a while, they award SB points just for doing the searches I used to do using Google. * Take surveys on their website * Answer the daily poll * Watch videos through their website or multiple mobile apps (I earn about 80 - 100 SB a day doing this) * Use their online shopping portal (I do most of my online shopping at major retailers who are part of the Swagbucks Shop and Earn program (like Amazon.com, Kohls.com, Walmart.com and more) and earn Swagbucks every time I shop. Recently, I was credited with 562 SB points (worth $5.62 in gift cards) for an online purchase I made a few weeks ago at Kohls.com. * Play games * Participate in special Swag Code events * Enter the daily Swag Code (which we usually let you know about here on the blog each day). Swagbucks posts bonus codes on their Facebook, Twitter and blog pages each day. If you have the Swagbucks Mobile App, it will buzz when there is a new code. When the code becomes available each day, one of us posts it here on the blog so we can all get it. The codes are only valid for an hour usually. Once you get the code, you then copy and paste the code into the Swag Code box at the top of the homepage of Swagbucks.com. Look for the circle with the words Swag Code next to it. . . .

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 25 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Walmart Today | Why We’re Setting a Hefty Goal to Reduce Emissions By Laura Phillips SVP – Sustainability, Walmart SOURCE: Walmart DESCRIPTION: What is sustainability? For businesses and consumers alike, it means finding cleaner, renewable sources of energy like solar panels and wind turbines, and reducing waste using the three R’s – reduce, reuse, recycle. Companies like Walmart and our suppliers can go one step further by setting a goal to sell products that are sourced and produced with people and the environment in mind. Since Walmart first began incorporating sustainability into our everyday work years ago, we have learned that it’s not just good for people and good for the environment – it’s good for business, too. It has made us a better company and showed us that when we work with others, we can make a greater impact. One specific way we’re aiming to do that is through Project Gigaton, a platform that will help our suppliers make progress in reducing emissions from their operations. Our collective goal is to eliminate 1 gigaton worth of emissions by 2030. That’s equal to three times the annual emissions of the state of California.  We’re excited about the positive actions already happening with some of our suppliers. Land O’Lakes, for example, by 2025 will enroll 20 million acres of land in the SUSTAIN program, a sustainable agriculture initiative in which farmers are reducing soil erosion, conserving water and cutting their carbon emissions by keeping more carbon in the ground. It’s also worth noting that consumers can take positive actions on sustainability. Recycling when possible and reducing food waste are just a couple of ways to cut waste and emissions. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, every ton of paper recycled can save the energy equivalent of 322 gallons of gasoline.

That's the name of Walmart's new hybrid bakery item, the Crotilla. It's a combination of a croissant and a tortilla and Walmart says it can be used for everything from breakfast sandwiches to Indian food.  Remember the "Cronut" trend? This one is very similar, but not as sweet as the doughnut, croissant combo.  Bradlee Underwood, senior buyer for Walmart Bakery says "we know customers, especially millennial customers, are hungry for new food trends and cool ways to experience food, and we want to be a destination for that." Walmart says the product is made with all butter, and baked fresh in their bakery every day.  Make breakfast and dress up your Crotilla with Nutella and bananas, or top a burger for lunch and wrap it in a Crotilla, or you could make a mini pizza in the toaster oven for a fun dinner.  What would you put on your Crotilla? Let us know on our Facebook page.  The new product is available in 832 Walmart stores nationwide and you can purchase them in packs of eight for $3.98 in the fresh bakery department.  Walmart even took the new product a step further and declared April 25 "National Crotilla Day."

April 25, 2017 08:00 ET Turbo Global Partners Executes Option to Acquire GP Brands, Inc. CARSON CITY, NV--(Marketwired - Apr 25, 2017) -  Turbo Global Partners (TURBO) trading as "DIBZ" (OTC PINK: DIBZ), has announced it has executed an option to acquire in whole GP Brands, Inc. GP Brands, Inc. is franchisor of 360 Goin' Postal® pack and ship retail franchise stores that are located throughout the United States, smaller Goin' Postal® franchise stores within Walmart Supercenters in the Southeast, and newly introduced boutique Goin' Postal® franchise kiosks within independent pharmacies in Florida. "I am pleased to announce that TURBO has executed an option to acquire GP Brands, Inc., franchisor of the Goin' Postal® pack and ship retail franchises," states Robert Singerman Chairman & CEO of TURBO. He continues, "With their 360-store national franchise network, Goin' Postal® pack and ship retail franchise stores serve the needs of hundreds of communities in the U.S. and this business model generates long-term renewable predictable cash flow, the ideal acquisition for our portfolio.

Andrew Link / alink@postbulletin.com Riders exit park-and-ride bus Friday, April 21, 2017, at the IBM campus in Rochester. Kim Bjugan doesn't know what she'd do without the bus that stops near the Paragon Chateau Theatre every half hour between 6 and 8:30 a.m. The Plainview resident was using the city's park-and-ride service at WalMart North, but when the retailer pulled the plug she switched to the site near the northeast movie theater, which offers 160 dedicated space, but on Thursday the lot at 3450 East Circle Drive Northeast contained more than 200 cars by 8 a.m. Stuart Geltman, senior transit planner with Aecom, the consultant hired to develop the city's latest five-year transit plan, said overcrowding is likely to continue. "As Mayo Clinic continues to grow — and associated downtown employers grow — the demand for park-and-ride systems are going to continue to grow," he said. Rochester contracts for 1,297 spaces spread throughout five lots, and the city and Olmsted County recently inked a deal to add another 138 spots at Graham Park in July. The spaces allow commuters a chance to park at no cost and use a bus pass to get downtown. Using a count from January last year, Geltman noted the city's five contract lots were filled to 101 percent capacity. The Chateau Theatre lot topped the list at 155 percent capacity, with 248 vehicles parking in a lot contracted for 160. The city is eyeing another 125 spaces for a park-and-ride stop at Bethel Lutheran Church, 810 Third Ave. SE, but the proposed contract was put on hold earlier this month when Rochester City Council member Mark Bilderback cited concerns voiced by neighbors. Bethel concerns Bilderback and city staff met with neighbors from the Slatterly Park and Sunnyside neighborhoods Tuesday to discuss the concerns and look at options. Ahmed Makkawy, a member of the Slatterly Park Neighborhood Association board, said two issues have been raised — worry that overflow parking will crowd neighborhood streets and that morning and afternoon traffic congestion will worsen where Third Avenue Southeast meets Ninth Street at the south side of the parking lot. "I see people cutting through the church parking lot to avoid Ninth Street," he said. Additionally, nearby neighbors envision the lot attracting more than 125 vehicles since it will be the closest park-and-ride location to Rochester's downtown. The direct service could lure people to fill streets Makkawy said are already considered tight. Bilderback said on-street parking could be handled by requiring permits, which has been a solution in a growing number of blocks surrounding Mayo Clinic facilities. Traffic concerns, on the other hand, he said will need to be studied. DMC discussion While the Bethel site would be the only park-and-ride location next to a residential neighborhood, discussions of enhancing parking opportunities in the general vicinity have been frequent since discussions of Destination Medical Center started. Last week, members of the DMC Corp. board met with transportation planners to discuss options, which could include constructing ramps on the edge of the DMC footprint to encourage commuters to use public transit to finish their daily journeys. R.T. Rybak, a DMCC board member, cited the challenge and pointed to the importance of making the final section of the commute as pleasant as possible, which requires predictable schedules. "The main thing we're trying to do is get people to do things that are illogical," he said, noting the logical choice would appear to be taking a car from door to door. To some extent, Mayo Clinic already encourages the use of parking alternatives that by limiting options for employees and providing bus passes for those who use the city's park-and-ride services. With two and a half years as a clinic employee, Bjugan said she's not sure what her options would be, and she said downtown parking privileges aren't provided until people are deep in their careers. System growth Nick Lemmer said that's why the city remains in search of new opportunities. The cost of providing the spaces varies for the city. In a new contract with the county, the city will pay $17 per space — $2,856 total — each month and will take care of snow and ice removal. The county will provide a credit for days when fairground events prohibit parking for commuters. If approved, the Bethel agreement will be the city's most expensive on a per-space basis — $28 per space — but Lemmer noted the church pays for snow removal and the city fills a growing need. Other spaces have been found at no cost to the city, especially those where commuters get off buses next to stores. "Ideally, we'd like them all to cost nothing," Lemmer said. He said at least one more park-and-ride location is in the works. City staff is working on an agreement with Rochester Community and Technical College, which could be in place this fall.

Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ... Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ... Entry: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ... Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ... Whether it’s Wal-Mart, Safeway, CVS, or any other kind of local or national retail chain, the norm nowadays is for customers to swipe loyalty or “customer care” cards during checkout.  Membership is a way for customers to accrue purchasing points, receive e-mail alerts about future buyer discounts, and most often reduced prices on certain goods selected at time of purchase. Why do retailers offer these deals? Are they feeling extra generous, or are they oblivious to profits? Not a chance. Retailers reward their loyalty-card swiping clientele simply because knowledge of the buying habits of their customers is extraordinarily valuable.  If they know what various demographics tend to buy, and better yet how and when they like to buy it, and in what quantities, they can plan inventory with much greater precision.  Lest we forget, inventory is very expensive, which means it’s crucial that retailers know buying habits so that they know best how to clear their shelves as quickly as possible.  Let’s also not forget that buying trends similarly help retailers divine what buyers are losing interest in; the latter equally crucial. And while it’s perhaps an apocryphal story, it’s been said that Target often knows its female customers are pregnant before they do.  All based on what they buy.  All of the above requires mention in consideration of President Donald Trump’s recently reiterated promise to “Buy American, Hire American.” Since the federal government awarded more than $445 billion in contracts in 2014 alone, Trump figures the spending should be directed toward U.S. companies.  Up front, let’s be clear that the feds were able to award $445 billion in contracts only insofar as taxpayers had $445 billion less to spend.  Consumption is always and everywhere an effect of production that always and everywhere takes place in the private sector.  Politicians get to play Santa only to the extent that we taxpayers have less to give away, or spend, or save. Back to President Trump, at first glance even the fiscally conservative might cheer on the idea that if the federal government is going to waste money, at least it should waste it on American companies.  In truth, such a belief is cruel.  It is simply because there’s very little useful information in government spending, but much that will impede company growth.  When it’s someone else’s money, buying is distorted to the point of unrecognizability.  Getting right to the point, government spending blinds businesses to economic and market realities.  When businesses cater to the needs of governments, they’re almost as a rule setting themselves up for a less prosperous future thanks to government waste not transmitting crucial information about the evolving needs of the real marketplace.  A visit to a government office is almost always a visit to the past, and to the technologies of the past.  Governments as a rule have to be conservative (in the non-ideological sense) about what they waste money on, and it’s invariably on what is already known and useful as opposed to what will be known, and what will transform. “Buy American” is cruel because it transmits false, growth-sapping information about what used to be valuable to businesses.  The problem is that investors generally only reward the businesses developing the goods and services that will be valuable in the future.  “Hire American” is also cruel.  Government contracts that Trump would like directed toward American companies that hire American workers are as previously mentioned, blinding.  Government spending is once again not information as much as it’s irrational noise transmitted by prodigals spending the money of others.  Just as it harms businesses by shielding them from market realities, so does it harm American workers.  Trump talks about the “theft of American prosperity,” but his support of that which shields American businesses and workers from the message of the markets reveals Trump as the burglar. Some may respond that government spending often has a forever quality to it such that its recipients don’t require information necessary to adapt, and they have a point.  But their point further underscores just how cruel is the notion of “Buy American, Hire American.” Precisely because government spending sometimes has endless qualities, its recipients aren’t as much required to positively evolve.  When corporations know the federal contract will be there no matter what, there’s reduced pressure to adapt their goods and services to the private marketplace on the way to sales that could eventually eclipse government buying that so often rewards stasis.  It’s probably easier to understand the above through the prism of the worker.  As is well known, governments rarely fire.  But because they don’t, because constant stress and fear of failure are not part of the government employment bargain, neither is the grand success that only comes to those bloodying themselves daily in the proverbial arena.  The U.S. is littered with great successes who failed a lot on the way to major wealth, major prestige, or both.  In that case, “Hire American” amounts to high sounding rhetoric that obscures something much darker.  Those employed thanks to government spending are meanly ensnared by what is relatively easy, and by extension, are paid to pursue a path to average.  This means that American workers who might “benefit” from Trump’s generosity with the money of others will be deprived of an employment path that’s difficult and often defined by periodic failure, but that for just those reasons offers the potential for the greatest advancement alongside personal fulfillment.  The paradoxical truth is that “Hire American” is cruel precisely because the possibility of embarrassing failure is not part of the equation. As for decrees about private businesses hiring the American born over foreigners, sadly even conservative publications like National Review have bought into the latter.  While members of the right would be horrified almost unanimously by governments planning what businesses import in order to create goods and services, some want that same government to plan the accession of easily the most important driver of company growth of all: human capital.  It’s a silly idea, so it’s no surprise that Trump buys into it.  At least rhetorically. Indeed, it’s possible that all the talk from Trump is just that.  One can hope.  “Buy American, Hire American” is war on the American people of the non-shooting kind.  And while Trump is promoting what is mindless with our money, that it’s our money he’s wasting is perhaps the least injurious aspect of his latest policy proposal meant to lure more American companies and more American workers onto Washington’s dole.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 1:20 PM, April 26, 2017 CHICAGO - Tyson Foods Inc <TSN.N>, the biggest U.S. chicken company, said on Wednesday it may raise wages again for workers at all of its poultry plants, a sign of an intensifying battle for employees in a tightening labor market. The increases would come after Arkansas-based Tyson boosted base wages for poultry workers by between 3 and 3.5 percent in November, said Hector Gonzalez, vice president for human resources operations. The base rate is a pay level workers can reach after finishing a probationary period. Under a pilot program, Tyson gave workers at one poultry plant a bigger increase in November and further raised pay at another facility in January, Gonzalez said. The company will evaluate how those increases help attract and retain workers and affect their performance, he said. "The pool of available labor is shrinking," Gonzalez said. Employers are competing for workers as the number of Americans on unemployment rolls has dropped to a 17-year low. Last year, companies including Wal-Mart Stores Inc <WMT.N>, a Tyson customer, raised wages for hourly workers under pressure from the competitive job market and labor groups calling for higher wages at retail chains. Tyson rivals Sanderson Farms Inc <SAFM.O> and Pilgrim's Pride Corp <PPC.O> did not respond to requests for comment about wages. Asked whether Tyson would pass on the cost for higher wages to customers, Gonzalez said the increases were an investment that executives "hope to get back in a lot of ways, particularly through operational efficiencies." At some facilities, Tyson is "looking for a dramatic improvement in the numbers of quality applicants to help staff our plants and avoid creating a scenario where we can't meet the demand of our customers," he said. Tyson said it did not have an estimate for the cost of the wage increases. In January, the company raised the starting wage at one union-represented poultry plant to $12 per hour from $10 and the base rate to $14 from $11.70. In November, employees at a separate plant saw the starting wage rise to $13 from $10 and the base rate rise to $15 from $11.65, Tyson said. That increase was made in lieu of the 3 to 3.5 percent increases at other plants. Tyson declined to give the locations of the two plants. The company has also shortened the time for workers at the plants to reach the base rate to six months from a year, Gonzalez said.

I cover seven themes that, while not comprehensive, span critical elements of the great global drama. Here is a short summary of each this month. Climate action: Trump endeavours to dig a little coal  President Trump moved to dismantle President Obama’s climate legacy with an executive order that seeks to dismantle the Clean Power Plan. Within a week, 17 US states filed a legal challenge. China immediately pledged to uphold its Paris climate commitments, including considerable efforts not to use coal, accusing the US of “selfish” behaviour. The EU joined the pushback. Miguel Árias Cañete, the EU’s climate action commissioner, said: “The continued leadership of the EU, China and many other major economies is now more important than ever. When it comes to climate and the global clean energy transition, there cannot be vacuums, there can only be drivers, and we are committed to driving this agenda forward.” Fine sentiments. But whereas China can point to policies consistent with its rhetoric, unfortunately the same cannot be said of much EU national policymaking, as things stand. Among EU states, only Sweden, Germany and France are pursuing goals consistent with the Paris target of 40% cuts in carbon emissions by 2030, according to a study by Carbon Market Watch. As ever, much will depend on industry, and one encouraging development this month was a pledge by Eurelectric, a trade body which represents 3,500 utilities with a combined value of over €200 billion, vowing no new investments in coal plants after 2020. Among the 28 EU countries, only Polish and Greek companies did not join the initiative. Energy transition: Fast, but not fast enough Record new renewable power capacity was added in 2016, UNEP figures showed: 138 gigawatts of it, up 9% despite investment falling by a worrying 23%. Renewables now provide 11.3% of global electricity. New global solar capacity outpaced wind, IRENA reported, by 71 to 51 gigawatts. Solar in California exceeded 50% of supply, for the first time ever, causing a net market oversupply resulting in a short interval of negative wholesale prices. Costs of renewables keep falling. GTM Research predicts that solar will drop below two cents per kilowatt hour in 2017. Offshore wind is the latest renewable to defy predictions. EnBW and Dong won offshore wind tenders in the North Sea with the first subsidy-free bids. Moody’s reported that wind is now cheaper to install new than coal is to operate in 58 power plants across 15 Midwestern states, at $20 a megawatt versus $30. Trump told a rally in Kentucky that “the miners are coming back”. But they aren’t. Not even top US coal boss Robert Murray expects that, in the face of real contemporary economics. As for US renewables companies, they were professing this month that their industries will thrive even without the Clean Power Plan. Their confidence is rooted in record solar installation and above average wind installation in 2016, plus federally agreed tax credits that would be difficult for the Trump administration to dismantle. The news was also broadly good for EVs this month, with Tesla meeting production targets and its shares soaring to an all time high, for a while making it the most valuable car company in America. Meanwhile Big Oil, facing predictions of significant demand destruction by EVs within just years, is struggling to break even. Most of the oil majors didn’t even cover their costs in 2016, a Wall Street Journal analysis showed, despite a rising oil price. Some oil companies say American shale will help save them. But of the three main oil-producing shale belts, production has already peaked in two. The oil industry loves to taunt its critics with the mantra that “peak oil is dead”. For some players, it is clearly not the case. Mexico’s proved oil reserves have declined by more than a third since 2013. This month its National Hydrocarbons Commission country warned that the country will run out of oil in less than nine years if there are no new discoveries. What an incentive fast oil depletion like that must be to build a clean-energy economy fast, never mind climate change. (More on this in my keynote to the MIREC renewables congress in Mexico City on 10th May). And there are many other stand-out non-climate incentives around our troubled world, from air pollution to risk of stranded assets. But new figures showed that clean energy investment dropped 17% in the first quarter of 2017. Tech for Good: Evidence of effort Advances in artificial intelligence and robotics outpace even those in clean energy, and continue to be used in many ways for the betterment of society. But evidence that they have profound downsides was everywhere this month. YouTube and Google’s use of algorithms to automatically match ads with content is the basis for widespread criticism that they fed the spread of fake news in the crucial months running up to both the Brexit vote and Trump’s election, much of it orchestrated by a well organised nationalist-right dark-propaganda network. The two companies ran into further, related, trouble, with big name advertisers boycotting them for posting ads next to racist and other offensive content. The boycotters included such diverse actors as AT&T, the BBC, the British government, PepsiCo, Starbucks, Verizon, and WalMart. Google responded quickly, saying it was in a race to ramp up its AI capability to deal with the problem. But that is no easy task. Nobody has pulled off such a feat of megadata sifting before. As part of their effort, they have begun to use outside firms to verify ad standards. They might want to hurry. The inventor of the web, Tim Berners-Lee, argues that concentration of power over information, such as Goggle and Facebook now possess, is dangerous for society. He is plotting, with others in the Decentralized Information Group at MIT’s Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence (CSAIL), means to decentralise control of data in his creation. The threat AI and robotics pose to jobs becomes ever clearer. More than 10 million UK workers are at risk of being replaced within 15 years, PwC calculated, some 30% of the workforce. The IPPR estimates a similar figure: robots replacing 1 in 3 UK jobs over the next 20 years. A report by the US National Bureau of Economic Research goes further, suggesting that large numbers of jobs have already been lost to robotics in America, and are unlikely to come back. Wages have been depressed in the process, they contend. The question arises, then, as to how much this has been fuelling populist rage, on both sides of the Atlantic, making it easier for nationalist demagogues to push their argument that “the other” – immigrants and anyone else who is not in what psychologists call their in-group – is entirely to blame. Whatever the answer to that question about the past, the additional stress just around the corner will clearly pose a dire threat to social cohesion if nothing is done. The imperative for government and business to act is obvious. Truth: Liars under growing scrutiny As investigations into the conduct of the Trump election and the Brexit vote continue, it becomes ever clearer that the nationalist right is capable of extraordinary feats of voter manipulation. A group of UK academics warned this month that dark money is a threat to the integrity of British elections. The Electoral Commission is investigating whether work by Cambridge Analytica, one data firm at the heart of the controversy, constitutes an undeclared donation from an impermissible foreign donor. Cambridge Analytica is majority owned by the hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer, a major bankroller of Donald Trump. Steve Bannon, Trump’s head of strategy, has been a major player in the development of the company and its capabilities. Filings of White House staffers’ interests this month show he has made millions shaping right-wing thought, via Cambridge Analytica and other organs. The pushback unfolding against this fast-emerging Orwellian narrative is often extraordinary to behold. The Los Angeles Times published a series of  essays by its editorial board this month. “Our Dishonest President”, the first was entitled. “Why Trump lies”, the second. They read like a science fiction novel of a dystopian future society. But they are about real-life America, today. New arenas of corporate responsibility are being stimulated, unsurprisingly. Google announced it will begin to display fact-checking labels to show if news it purveys is true or false. Facebook gave a green light to its employees to protest against Trump on May 1st. Dramas build slowly in the courts as truth and lies compete. A judge rejected Trump’s defense against a claim he incited violence at one of his rallies. Equality: Talk of cutting aid as famine rages Meanwhile, though you would hardly know it from mainstream media coverage, we are in the midst of the gravest humanitarian crisis since 1945 – since the creation of the United Nations. 20 million people face starvation and famine in Yemen, Somalia, South Sudan and Nigeria, the UN warns. Drought has descended on Kenya, triggering violence as displaced peoples migrate. Amid all this, populist nationalists continue to contend that aid budgets should be cut. The UK government, to its credit, is resisting this so far. As for the considerable potential role of clean energy in building equality and alleviating poverty, an international gathering of the Sustainable Energy for All organisation in New York this month called for more urgent action on progress towards global energy goals. In SolarAid, my colleagues and I could not agree more. Our work is based on the fact that if you burn oil in a kerosene lamp in Africa and it will cost you almost $80 a year, yet a solar lamp retailing at around $5 will give clean light for free, for 4 years. So if you were one of the poorest people in Africa, which would you rather do? Save $70 a year to spend on food and other essentials, in a time of famine, or burn a fistful of ten dollar bills each year, and risk your health breathing the fumes? This should be an obvious starting point for a massive programme to free up local money for the necessities of poverty alleviation, SolarAid contends. But sales of the most affordable of these lights are actually falling in Africa, and in fact the rest of the world too. In Malawi, for example, we are one of only a few organisations working to help. More on that subject, a microcosm of global challenges and opportunities in energy, in an e-mail in a week or so. Reform of capitalism: Graphic evidence of the need The Bank of England has admitted to fearing, in the current febrile financial climate, that it may not be able to spot the next global crisis coming. Few who studied the forensics of the last one, and the response – or mostly lack thereof – can be surprised. There are obvious candidates for a trigger in the inflated stock market, and mountainous debt in car loans, credit cards, and mortgages. The Brexit gamble is also potentially on the list. The IMF professes that its unpredictable outcome poses a risk to global stability. Given the fact that regulators regard another crisis as inevitable, and see an unreadable multiplicity of potential paths to it, who can realistically contend that the unbridled 21st century version of capitalism is anything close to a satisfactory way to run a global economy today? Root-to-branch reform might take some mapping, but starting points are not too difficult to find. One involves the jailing of executives guilty of gross corruption. Until this starts happening, how there can be hope for wider reform, or the necessary adjustments of cultures? Shell offered up a perfect example this month. The company is under investigation for one of the most corrupt deals in the history of the oil industry.  E-mails show that top executives handed a billion dollars to the Nigerian government, knowing it would be passed to a convicted money-launderer,  in return for a giant oilfield. The CEO of the day, Peter Voser, knew of the deal. The current CEO, ben van Buerden, described the evidence in e-mails as “really unhelpful”, but “just pub talk.” One might hope that if the forces of the law cannot sort out behaviour of this kind., then investors might be queuing to punish a company as wide of the ethical mark as this using their money and governance power. Not on recent evidence from Wall Street. The social media company Snap, owner of a popular photo exchange website, went public in February with investors queuing to pour cash into it. This despite the twenty-something co-founders specifying that investors would have zero voting rights. Far from failing, in the exodus of financial custodians that this dangerous first-of-a-kind should have been faced with, Snap raised $3.4 billion and achieved a valuation of $19.7 billion. As of early March it was worth $28 billion, which would put it in the 100 biggest economies, were it a nation. What a gloomy precedent this now sets for the future. It raises the prospect, in principle, of a small cadre of almost unregulated and unconstrained tech billionaires calling the shots on how the AI and robotics innovations of the next few years are deployed. We had better all hope, if this is the way investors and regulators allow events to unfold, that said billionaires, and investors in them, are not friends of the the populist nationalist right. Yet the way financiers were lining up to engage with Marine Le Pen as the French Presidential election neared suggests we can far from rely on this. Common security: If you elect nationalist demagogues, you will be more likely to experience World War 3 Let me be brief on this final point. In the Trump administration’s handling of Syria and North Korea, where is there any evidence at all of basic statesmanship? Of rudimentary strategy even? Of any thought that there might be lessons to be learned in decades of diplomacy? Ahead of the election, Trump seemed to grasp the inadvisability of poking a hornets nest with a stick, let alone many millions of dollars worth of cruise missiles. “Again, to our very foolish leader”, he tweeted at Obama (all in capital letters), “do not attack Syria – if you do many very bad things will happen.” Suffice it to say that one particularly bad knee-jerk reaction from Trump and/or those he turns into his adversaries, and all bets are off on the balance of play I endeavour to summarise above. A message for my senior grandson, if he made it this far in this blog. Sorry fella, I have been trying for a quarter century. But I and all the people like me have pretty much failed, to date. Hopefully there is some comfort in the thought that we are still trying. 3 Tags: clean energy transition, climate change responses Jeremy Leggett Jeremy Leggett is a social entrepreneur and author.

(Clean Line Energy Partners) Photo by Contributed Photo /Times Free Press. The developers of a proposed transmission line to carry wind-generated power from the Oklahoma plains to the Tenneseee Valley claim their $2.5 billion project could help TVA get cheaper and cleaner power. But the political winds appear to be blowing against TVA buying the wind-generated power, even though it is cheaper than even the fuel prices for coal or natural gas, according to one of the executives who has worked on the project for the past eight years. POLL: Should TVA support wind energy generation? Yes No Submit Results Yes: 68.75% (11) No: 31.25% (5) Total Responses: 16 Mario Hurtado, executive vice president, development, Clean Line Energy Partners, speaks Tuesday, April 25, 2017, to writers and editors at the Chattanooga Times Free Press.

Clean Line Energy wants to build a 720-mile direct-current transmission line from Oklahoma to a Memphis suburb to carry 4,000 megawatts of wind-generated electricity from where the wind blows the strongest to where the power demand is most needed. Clean Line Energy wants to build a 720-mile... Illustration by Contributed Photo /Times Free Press. "We can get the power delivered to TVA for less than 2 cents per kilowatthour, which is less than just the fuel costs for coal or natural gas generation," said Mario Hurtado, the executive vice president of development for the Houston-based Clean Line Energy Partners. "It is a very, very compelling economic prospect for the region to get a long-term supply of power that is clean, that reduces air pollution, that is renewable to help economic development and is lower priced than just burning more fossil fuel." TVA signed a memorandum of understanding with Clean Line Energy in 2011 to study the proposal, but the utility has yet to commit to buying any of the 3,500 megawatts of wind-generated power Clean Line Energy will bring to the western edge of TVA's territory along its 720-mile transmission line from near Diamond, Okla. TVA says it doesn't need additional power generation due to the stagnant demand for electricity in its seven-state region. But Hurtado said Clean Line could substitute for more expensive existing generation and provide the type of renewable power that businesses like Google, Apple, Wal-Mart and Facebook want from power utilities where they locate. "I think politics is getting in the way of rational economic decisions," Hurtado said. "Big infrastructure projects are always political." U.S. Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., one of the biggest defenders of the nuclear power industry, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., one of the biggest backers of the coal industry, are among Tennessee Valley lawmakers who are skeptical of the Clean Line project. In a speech on the Senate floor last month, Alexander said TVA abandoned its Bellefone nuclear power plant because it doesn't need any additional power so it shouldn't contract with a Houston company for future wind power that he said may prove inconsistent and more expensive in the future. "Why would TVA announce that it doesn't need new power for the next 15 years, sell a nuclear power plant capable of producing reliable baseload power for the next 60 years, and then turn right around and buy unreliable wind power that might only be available for 20 or 30 years assuming the turbines don't break down?" he asked. Alexander urged TVA to wait on the appointment of new board members by President Trump, who will be able to appoint a majority of the nine-member board this year, before deciding on the Clean Line proposal. But Hurtado said waiting will only raise the costs of wind power since federal production tax credits for builders of wind turbines are being phased out over the next three years and that will add about 2 cents per kilowatthour to the price of wind generation. "We will still be competitive in the future, but not as competitive as we are right now so we believe it is important to act this year," he said. Backers of infrastructure spending proposed by Donald Trump during his campaign last year also are backing the Clean Line Energy project since the $2.5 billion transmission line is expected to spur another $7 billion of wind turbines in Oklahoma and Texas. Construction of the project is projected to add more than 5,000 jobs. The Clean Line Energy project was one of 50 major projects compiled by an advisory task force for the Trump administration last year as part of the president's goal of creating 4 million infrastructure jobs and injecting $1 trillion into the American economy. CG/LA Infrastructure, a global infrastructure strategy firm in Washington, D.C., is sponsoring a conference today to tout its Blueprint 2025 to double U.S. infrastructure investment. The plan includes the Clean Line project. "The U.S. electricity system, with 450,000 miles of high-tension transmission lines, represents our greatest achievement and our greatest vulnerability," said Norm Anderson, president of CG/LA Infrastructure. "Four new electricity transmission lines alone would usher $30 billion in new capital and create 51,000 direct and indirect jobs." TVA continues to study the Clean Line Energy proposal as the company tries to finalize purchases of land easements and complete other final environmental approvals for its transmission line. TVA could both buy the power from Çlean Line and use its transmission lines to wheel the wind power to other Southern utilities wanting more renewable energy, including Duke, Southern and Entergy. "We continue to evaluate the costs for Clean Line to connect to the TVA system and the potential impact that would have on reliability for our customers," TVA spokeswoman Gail Rymer said Tuesday. "Of course, any upgrades that would be necessary to our system for the interconnection to our grid would be the responsibility of Clean Line."

Updated 6 hours ago Three years ago, Rusty and Christy Bryner began discussions on starting their own business. They wanted something they could manage themselves while serving the community. After many conversations, Munch Lazy was born. The Jeannette couple delivers food to your door, from snacks to groceries and even take-out orders. “My wife and I were looking for a creative idea, a small business to start up,” says Rusty Bryner. “We had talked about starting our own business without much direction on what that would be.” Bryner found inspiration while working at the Light of Life Rescue Mission on Pittsburgh's North Side. He often ordered from Grub Hub, a food delivery service. After doing some research, he realized that online food services are scarce in Westmoreland County. The National Grocers Association reports that 16 percent of Americans shop online for their groceries. So far, the delivery experience is mostly limited to larger cities. While the Walmart in North Huntingdon offers an online order option, customers must still go to the store to pick up the food. Other grocery chains, such as Giant Eagle and Shop 'N Save, may offer online-ordering and delivery services, but they are only available in the Pittsburgh area and other large cities. Munch Lazy bridges that gap and brings food to your door. The business, which began in March, is run from the Bryners' Jeannette home. While Christy handles the marketing and design aspects, Rusty handles the logistics. There are three components to the business. The first is restaurant take-out orders. The customer can order the food and Munch Lazy will do the pick up. Delivery for these orders averages 27 minutes. “They don't have to worry about going out to dinner,” Rusty Bryner says. “We'll deliver to anyone with a 15601 or 15644 zip code.” The second service is geared toward the late-night munchers. They have a full menu of drinks, chips and dips, and various cookies and dessert items. “The snack menu so far has been used as an addition to the take out,” Rusty says. The third part of the business is grocery orders. Customers provide a list of the items they need, along with preferred brands and sizes. There is an order form on the website that can be used for the grocery order and emailed to them. “We have extended hours for grocery orders,” Rusty Bryner says. “We do deliveries during the week in the evenings. Weekends we are very flexible. We are willing to stretch coverage for grocery orders because we can take more time. “We've had a great response with the elderly and new mothers who don't want to leave the house,” he says. “We're looking at ways on how to get onto college campuses to get the word out to them.” As of now, they do not deliver cigarettes or alcohol. “Alcohol is pretty well regulated. I'm unsure of that,” Rusty says. So far, the marketing campaign has involved Facebook and word of mouth. Even with limited marketing exposure so far, the business has doubled within the past month.

In the surveillance photos, you can see the suspects at stores like Food Lion and Walmart. Concord police is teaming up with the U.S. Secret Service to track down the suspects. PHOTOS: Nearly dozen wanted in Concord credit-card skimming cases The skimming devices were found at three gas stations; Exxon, 1160 Copperfield Boulevard, Kangaroo Express, 1529 Concord Parkway, Exxon, 1110 Union Street. (Watch Action 9 investigator Jason Stoogenke explain how to protect yourself from skimmers) Police said the skimming devices were placed on card readers on pumps and ATMs. They used credit card information stolen from devices put on gas pumps, ATMs and retail stores, police said. “It can happen anywhere and that's a shame,” a driver said. “You work hard for your money.” In response to the incidents, one of the gas stations is putting red tape on the pump, indicating there is a good chance the pump is compromised “It's a good way to find out who is doing it,” said Lisa Hammer, who works at the Exxon off Copperfield Boulevard. She said the skimmer device was found two months ago on pumps 3 and 4. “You wouldn't expect it from Concord, small town not many people,” Hammer said. Concord police have warrants out for this woman, Yelenys Rodriguez Peraza, 38, of Miami. They need help identifying the other suspects but say it is unclear if they are working together. Concord police are asking the public’s help in identifying nearly a dozen people believed to be connected to skimming cases across the city. Drivers hope everyone is caught soon. “No excuse at all, everybody works for their money,” Terrance Brevard said. “I get up every morning, every night and go to work, I expect people to do the same thing.” Read more top trending stories on wsoctv.com: Dale Earnhardt Jr. to retire from NASCAR following 2017 season Blood gang members receive life sentences in Lake Wylie double murder Man arrested more than 40 times prompts north Charlotte SWAT standoff 13-year-old arrested in connection with pair of sex assaults in Charlotte Big rig crashes into barriers in I-77 toll lane construction zone VIDEO: Keith Monday's Tuesday morning forecast Blood gang members to be sentenced in Lake Wylie double murder VIDEO: Body cam shows man chased, tackled, arrested by CMPD officers © 2017 Cox Media Group.

Photographer: Gabriella Demczuk/The New York Times President Donald Trump plans to unveil a tax cut blueprint Wednesday that would apply a vastly reduced, 15 percent business tax rate not only to corporations but also to companies that now pay taxes through the personal income tax code — from mom-and-pop businesses to his own real estate empire, according to several people briefed on the proposal. The package will also increase the standard deduction for individuals, providing a modest cut for middle-income people and simplifying the process of filing tax returns, according to people briefed on its details. That proposal is opposed by homebuilders and real estate agents, who fear it would diminish the importance of the mortgage interest deduction. And it is likely to necessitate eliminating or curbing other popular deductions, a politically risky pursuit. It is not clear whether the plan will include Trump’s promised $1 trillion infrastructure program, but it will jettison a House Republican proposal to impose a substantial tax on imports, known as a border adjustment tax, which would have raised billions of dollars to help offset the cost of the cuts, two of the people said. With that decision, Trump acceded to pressure from retailers and conservative advocacy groups, but the move could deepen the challenge of passing a broad tax overhaul in Congress, where concern about the swelling federal deficit runs high. His plan would put off the difficult part of a tax overhaul: closing loopholes and increasing other taxes to limit the effect of tax cuts on the budget deficit. Republicans are likely to embrace the plan’s centerpiece, substantial tax reductions for businesses large and small, even as they push back against the jettisoning of their border adjustment tax. The 15 percent rate would apply both to corporations, which now pay 35 percent, and to a broad range of firms known as pass-through entities — including hedge funds, real estate concerns like Trump’s and large partnerships — that currently pay taxes at individual rates, which top off at 39.6 percent. That hews closely to the proposal Trump championed during his campaign. But Trump’s decision to extend the corporate tax cut to real estate conglomerates like his own will give Democrats a tailor-made line of attack. “Yesterday, we learned President Trump wants to slash the corporate tax rate, even though corporations already dodge most of their tax responsibilities while making record profits,” said Frank Clemente, executive director of the liberal Americans for Tax Fairness. “Today, we find out it’s even worse. In trying to slash taxes for ‘pass-through’ business entities, Trump is seeking to dramatically reduce his own tax bill.” The people who were briefed on the plan spoke on the condition of anonymity before a formal announcement that Trump has said will come on Wednesday, three days before his presidency reaches the 100-day mark with nothing to show for his promises to cut taxes or revamp the health care system. The border adjustment tax may be revisited later but was considered too controversial to include now. Spokeswomen for the White House and Treasury Department declined to comment on the details of the plan before Wednesday’s announcement, which is expected to contain only broad principles, leaving unanswered crucial questions about the financing of the package and the process for advancing it through Congress. Emerging from a meeting in the Capitol where he briefed Republican congressional leaders Tuesday evening, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said participants had “very, very productive discussions” and were united in their desire to accomplish a tax overhaul this year. The broad contours of the plan seemed to please conservatives who had worried in recent weeks that Trump, who has dropped or modified many of the major proposals of his campaign, was drifting away from the plan he had laid out for voters. “Conservatives are going to be very happy with this plan, because it achieves a lot of the objectives that we’ve wanted: lower business taxes, simplification, and not a major tax increase that is unacceptable,” said Stephen Moore, an economist at the Heritage Foundation who advised Trump’s campaign and helped craft his tax proposal. But Moore conceded that finding ways to offset the large revenue reductions envisioned in the blueprint would be a challenge. “That’s the unknown right now, is whether there is some sort of pay-for for any of this,” he said. Government officials crafting the tax plans are aware of the math problem, one of the people involved in the proposal said, but they see the 15 percent corporate tax rate as a compelling starting point for negotiations. Trump may yet reveal other tactics for replenishing lost tax revenue, someone who has been briefed on the plans said. But the final plans remain very much in flux. At midafternoon Tuesday, for instance, it was still not clear whether personal income-tax rate cuts or an increase in the standardized deduction for individuals would be part of Wednesday’s announcement. Nor was the precise fate of a $1 trillion infrastructure spending plan that Gary Cohn, the director of the National Economic Council, has pressed to pair with the tax overhaul. The demise of the border adjustment tax was met with relief by Republicans in the Senate, who had been cool to it from the start. On Tuesday, Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said it was safe to conclude that the provision was “not going anywhere” because of skepticism in the Senate. But Cornyn described Trump’s plan to cut the corporate income tax to 15 percent as “pretty aggressive,” with unknown consequences for the deficit. Other Republican senators appeared ready to embrace a tax proposal that adds to the deficit in the name of jump-starting the economy. Republicans appear intent on using parliamentary rules that would block Democrats from filibustering the plan in the Senate, but would also put a time limit on the tax cuts. “I’m open to getting this country moving,” said Sen. Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, chairman of the powerful Senate Finance Committee. “I’m not so sure we have to go that route, but if we do, I can live with it.” Most analysts say the notion that Trump’s tax cuts will pay for themselves is unrealistic. A Tax Foundation analysis concluded this week that, on its own, a 15 percent corporate tax rate would reduce federal revenue by about $2 trillion over a decade. To make up for those losses without raising taxes elsewhere, the economy would have to become five times larger. Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., said he was also open to tax cuts with an expiration date if that was the only way to get them passed without Democratic support, pointing to President George W. Bush’s cuts. “You look at the tax cuts from 2002 and 2003 — well over 90 percent of them became permanent law,” Blunt said. Democrats have criticized Republicans for failing to engage with them on a tax overhaul. Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the ranking Democrat on the Finance Committee, said he would be open to working with Republicans on a plan that would bring home corporate profits parked overseas and use some of the funds to pay for infrastructure. But Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Senate majority leader, said Tuesday that he intended to pass tax legislation through budget rules that would block a filibuster. He accused Democrats of being more interested in “wealth transfers” than spurring economic growth. So far, the Senate has taken a back seat in tax discussions. The abandonment of the border adjustment tax will deal a blow to the comprehensive rewrite of the tax code championed by House Speaker Paul Ryan and Rep. Kevin Brady of Texas, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. Brady said Tuesday that he would press ahead with the import tax, not merely because it would make up for lost revenue but because it would protect American jobs. However, he acknowledged that his goal of producing legislation before summer was slipping. “I’m less focused on the month than on the year for tax reform, which would be this year,” Brady said.

The adoption of online behavior has lead to experts placing bets on what retailers will survive. Several, such as Sports Authority and HH Gregg, have been shuttered, while other such as Rue 21 are reportedly filing bankruptcy soon.  NBC 4 Washington has a disturbing list of retailers said to be under threat. The most potentially game-changing closure, if it comes to pass, would be Sears. The giant retailer, a staple in many malls across the country, has had several years of sales decline, and announced it may face bankruptcy. Other mall-anchor retailers have been close behind with sales struggles – Nordstrom's and Macy's notably – or are fighting tooth and nail to discover new opportunities.  Sears' current era is a stark contrast to other retailers which are online first. They have innovated core operations and scaled sales through applied business intelligence – the holy grail of analytics. Amazon, which has been at the forefront of the eCommerce retail movement, is experiencing a modern day version of the Sears' evolution beyond its mail-order catalog. Sears evolved from its mail order business to serve as one-stop shopping for consumers' household needs. According to Wikipedia's account of Sears history, the retailer had its heyday expansion in the 1950s and 1960s, becoming the largest US retailer. It held that position until WalMart passed it in 1989. Today it operates 1500 stores total, down from 3500 locations in 2010. So what lessons should retailers consider as the fate of Sears unfolds? Apply analytics with relevant expertise Successful retailers are gaining more than right-sized operations.  They are making inroads into the use of advanced analytics.   Applying these techniques means relies on judgment about where advanced analytics can best serve an organization.  Amazon has used machine learning to help predict likely purchase outcomes, driving not only its own sales, but also positioning itself as an attractive partner with other organization. That contrasts with the strategy from Sears' parent company Sears Holdings, run by real estate mogul Edward Lampert. Sears Holdings invested heavily in its property, with Sears acquiring an even larger real estate footprint with its Kmart acquisition. While real estate can be valuable, unlocking that capital through sales and deals might not occur rapidly enough to be of help to  a company's earnings. Analytics can save capital from poor-performing investments. Amazon has not only built an online audience, it has expanded its resources into cloud services, consumer IoT technology like Amazon Dash & Echo, and an offline retail presence. It opened Amazon Go, a convenience store that features no check-out line as a real-world generator of customer preference, and a source of data for its predictive engine initiatives.    Now contrast that against Sears and its considerable investment in real estate. The holdings have left Sears burdened with mall locations that are experiencing declining foot traffic, which in turn has depressed sales. Apply analytics with a coherent vision across an organization The current blending of product and services comes from a strategy trend – the capacity to create a customer experience offline and online.  Implementing it requires coordinating networked devices and services for nimble decision making.  Many traditional retailers such as Sears have made strides to incorporate technology, but have not made fast adjustments to a marketplace that is moving at light speed to engage customers and deliver experiences. Unleash a community of developers to create your solutions Someone once said that software is eating the world. Well, analytics involves software, and more than ever retailers need developers to create offerings that enhance the software that impact customer experience.  And the developer world has become more accommodating in supporting such an environment. Programming languages have frameworks, functions for addressing repeatable coding tasks, and libraries to implement algorithms.   This makes repeatable tasks in development and modeling easier to create, run, and share results with colleagues. Amazon is among the leading organizations attracting a developer community around its solutions. It announced a new program that will allow developers to build and host most Alexa skills using Amazon Web Services for free.  But organizations across a number of industries are establishing communities of their own. Last spring I got to speak to a few Capital One managers at, of all places, OSCON, an O'Reilly Media conference aimed specifically at developers.  Capital One's presence – and OSCON sponsorship – was part of a larger strategy to attract developers for its open source development dashboard Hygeia. Get In The Game…Now! Sears lagged behind The Gap, which invested quickly in analytics, and combined website elements across its various clothing brands so that customers could shop seamlessly and easily. The result? The Gap's eCommerce decision exceeded $1 billion in online revenue in a fiscal quarter, and did so for the first time back in 2009, years before Sears began experiencing declining sales and closing stores. Retailers are starting to realize that analytics is essential for meaningful execution of strategy. Sears may have been too late in adopting, but it is not too late for others to integrate new tactics that can renew their relevance.

When’s the medical marijuana become available? • Entered the liquor store when one of those bad-ass looking Harleys pulled up. Driver walked in. Had on the usual garb. A bandana, black jeans with a black shirt, leather and worn boots. Grizzly beard. Tough looking fella. He gets a bottle of Kahlua. Yep, Kahlua. I’m looking like some lame-ass professor in my flip flops, horned rim glass, t-shirt and frat boy cargo shorts, but am carrying out a big bottle of bourbon. Maker’s Mark. Spent the next several minutes wondering how this upside downness could be Obama’s fault. Maybe it’s the fault of that jackass Trump, who might have some of us thinking about a White Russian. • Sure, some songs are better than others, and folks with a deep aversion to any form of country music may abhor “Girl With Far Away Eyes.” But is there such a thing as a bad Rolling Stones tune? • Most, if not all, pharmaceutical companies have a policy against their drugs being used for lethal injection. They want us to know their products are for medicine, and not for death. That’s admirable, and am sure well received by the growing number of Americans who believe the death penalty is not the option of a civilized society. But there is an obvious in-your-face hypocrisy with drug company policies on executions. They object to direct death of convicted murderers via lethal injection, but have for decades encouraged the broad use of opioids, which has resulted in the indirect deaths of thousands of innocents. There is a lot of money to made with pain meds. There is no money to be made with death meds. Low profits create an easy path for taking the high road. And vice versa. • Speaking of killing innocent people. A 2014 report from the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences noted: “Since 1973, 144 people on death row have been exonerated. As a percentage of all death sentences, that’s just 1.6 percent. But if the innocence rate is 4.1 percent, more than twice the rate of exoneration, the study suggests what most people assumed but dreaded: An untold number of innocent people have been executed. Further, the majority of those wrongfully sentenced to death are likely to languish in prison and never be freed.” The report also found that the rate of exoneration for death row inmates is higher than any other category. “Death sentences represent less than one-tenth of 1% of prison sentences in the United States, but they accounted for about 12% of known exonerations of innocent defendants from 1989 through early 2012, a disproportion of more than 130 to 1.” What is our acceptable margin of error for use of the death penalty? 1 in 10? 5 in 100? If some innocent people have to die to ensure our version of the ultimate justice, what number would allow you comfort? My vote is something along the lines of zero. • Wal-Mart Stores CEO Doug McMillion was paid – salary, stocks, gum and trinkets, use of the corporate jet to get to the end of his driveway and get the mail, etc. – $22.352 million in the most recent fiscal year. OK, maybe not gum and trinkets and mail gathering, but he did get paid $22.352 million. That’s $61,238 a day. The next four guys received $38.11 million combined. The five guys earned $60.462 million – or enough for 1.511 million bottles of Maker’s Mark – in the recent fiscal year. The general fund budget for Arkansas’ second largest city is around $42 million. Based on the most recent Census data on household income in Arkansas, the combined pay of the five Wal-Mart associates at the top of the associate ladder earned as much as 1,439 Arkansas households. You, Kind Reader, are probably thinking this is one of those Bernie Sanders-induced rants. That’s up to your perspective about value and worth and the philosophical intangibles that range between an unfettered marketplace and the social responsibility of a corporation and associated executives. But here’s the thing. Wal-Mart Stores generated roughly $1.331 billion in revenue a day in the recent fiscal year. Not a typo. $1.331 billion a day. Would you, as a board member of company XYZ, vote to pay the top five folks a combined $165,000 a day to manage the collection of more than $1.33 billion in daily sales? My simple Johnson County farm boy logic sees that as a square deal. I’d even throw in the gum and trinkets.

PUNE, INDIA, April 25, 2017 /EINPresswire.com/ — The market research analyst predicts the e-cigarettes market in the US to grow at a CAGR of around 33% during the forecast period. The increased desire among consumers to quit smoking tobacco is the primary driver for the growth of this market. For instance, according to the US government, approximately 480,000 people die in the country every year due to active smoking. E-cigarettes are considered a healthier alternative to tobacco smoking, and, therefore, are becoming popular among end-users. The low cost of e-cigarettes is also expected to contribute to the growth of the market during the forecast period. E-cigarettes are cheaper than traditional cigarettes due to the lack of legitimate taxation on their sale. The wholesale price of a disposable e-cigarette is between USD 2.5 and USD 4.0, whereas rechargeable e-cigarette costs between USD 6 and USD 15.

Strategies News provided by National Press Club , STEMconnector 25 Apr, 2017, 17:42 ET Share this article WASHINGTON, April 25, 2017 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- The nation's top employers join industry thought leaders at the Global STEM Talent Summit Initiative (GSTS) on April 27–28th, 2017, at The National Press Club in Washington, D.C. Its mission is to create solutions for developing the next generation of skilled talent necessary to drive innovation and economic growth within a global context. The summit is led by STEMconnector,® the leading organization working with industry, higher education, NGOs and the public sector to provide resources and leadership that supports smart STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) investments. This year's theme is short-term STEM talent development strategies and impact on business performance. "We are building off the success of last year's first-ever employer-led annual Global STEM Talent Summit and bringing together major industry partners to address the STEM talent gap that exists in our country—and globally," said Dr. Heidi Kleinbach-Sauter, Senior Vice President, Global R&D, PepsiCo, and Chairwoman of the Global STEM Talent Summit. "We have fully transitioned from STEM theory into action and our industry partners are implementing STEM talent development strategies to deliver sustainable enterprise growth." Several keynotes will present a call to action, such as Jan Geldmacher, President of Sprint Business, in conjunction with "Pepper," the intelligent humanoid robot. Jay Bavisi, CEO, EC-Council, will address why we must upskill STEM talent for the projected 8.1 million global cyber jobs, with two million in the USA alone.  Surya Kant, President, North America, UK and Europe Operations, Tata Consultancy Services, challenged last year's summit participants to work on supporting one million tech jobs for the underserved, and he returns in 2017 to build on the digital fluency priority. "Digital technologies are transforming every industry around the world, including manufacturing, banking, retail, and healthcare. Companies are adopting the forces of cloud and automation to make their enterprise far more agile and responsive, in order to provide superior experiences to their end consumers," says Surya. "In this new world order, companies across almost all sectors need talent with a combination of digital fluency, innovation excellence, and employability skills." Other keynotes include Robert Fraley, Executive Vice President and Chief Technology Officer, Monsanto, and Nina Vaca, Chairman & CEO, Pinnacle Group. Media Moderators include Megan Murphy, Editor, Business Week, Bloomberg, and Angela Greiling Keane, Deputy Technology Editor, Politico. This two-day summit serves as a platform for discussion, sharing best practices in STEM talent development strategies, networking and taking collective action to drive scale and speed in helping to solve the STEM shortfall. Together with 50 strategic partners representing more than six million employees, over $2 trillion in combined revenue, and broad industry segmentation from over 200 delegates, the GSTS will report on progress made as part of a three-year strategic roadmap that aims to drive sustainable impact and deliver tangible solutions to diminish the STEM talent shortfall gap. "As disruption is evident, business leaders are shifting focus to talent investments and engagement in STEM and tackling the latest of new technology and skills required for jobs," says Edie Fraser, Chief Executive Officer of STEMconnector.® "As this GSTS initiative continues, leaders are intent on identifying and proselytizing investments in education proven to strengthen a sustainable, long-term talent pool." "Ensuring a robust and sustainable pipeline of stem talent is key to drive innovation in industries and economies all over the world," said Seema Kumar, Vice President, Innovation, Global Health and Science Policy Communication, Johnson & Johnson. "Great innovative ideas can come from anywhere, and our opportunity is to cultivate a broad base of stem talent that is inclusive and diverse. The future of our economy… and our world… depends on it." The 2017 GSTS strategic partners include Acord, APCO Worldwide, Apollo Education Group, AT&T, BAE Systems, Base 11, BP, Burning Glass, Cargill, Carnival Corporation, Cengage Learning, Centene Corporation, Cigna, Credit Suisse, Dassault Systems, Deloitte, Discovery Education, FedEx, Gulfstream, Honeywell, Hope Street Group, Gallup, GM, Eaton, Indeed, Johnson & Johnson Innovation, ManpowerGroup, Lockheed Martin, Mind Research Institute, Microsoft, Monsanto, Monster, My College Options, The National Press Club, PepsiCo, Pillsbury Law, Pinnacle Group, Smiths Group, Stratasys, Sodexo, Sprint, S&P Global, Tata Consultancy Services, UCI Henry Samueli School of Engineering, Unilever, University of Phoenix, and Walmart.  Join us at the Global STEM Talent Summit The Global STEM Talent Summit will be held on April 27–28, 2017 at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C.

In the spirit of patriotic occupiers of wildlife habitat who don’t believe any place is so beautiful, historic, or ecologically significant that it couldn’t be improved by a Walmart and/or a strip mine, Trump wants to do in a few national monuments. And this time he’s not just stopping with rolling back Barack Obama. President Donald Trump is planning to sign an executive order on Wednesday ordering a review of national monument designations going back 21 years, according to multiple media reports. That’s every monument named under Obama, every monument named under George W. Bush, and several named by Bill Clinton. That’s the islets of the California coast, the groves of Giant Sequoia, and over 6,000 archaeological sites at Canyon of the Ancients. It’s both the monument to the battleship Arizona at Pearl Harbor and the internment camp for Japanese Americans at Tule Lake. It’s monuments that include the deepest point in the ocean, the trails of ancient reptiles, and scenes of perfect beauty. The monument to Harriet Tubman is in there. So is the home of “buffalo soldier” Charles Young, the first African American to reach the rank of colonel in the US Army. There were 55 national monuments created in the decades that Donald Trump wants to “review,” and together they represent  treasures of history and the majesty of nature. Now they all hang on the word of a man whose idea of ‘”outdoors” is a golf course. Conservation groups have condemned the impending executive order as an attack on U.S. public lands. It’s not an attack on public lands. It’s an attack on the public. 145 Comments Share this article 167 167 167 145 Comments Comment Settings Close Settings Auto refresh Collapse on load Show hidden Show until I hide Comments are closed on this story.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 25 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman REPORT: Fortune 500 Companies Accelerating Renewable Energy, Energy Efficiency Efforts SOURCE: Ceres DESCRIPTION: Media Contacts: April 25, 2017 /3BL Media/ — Despite efforts from Washington to sideline action on climate change, a growing number of Fortune 500 companies are taking increasingly ambitious steps to reduce their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, procure more renewable energy and reduce their energy bills through energy efficiency, according to a new report released today from World Wildlife Fund (WWF), Ceres, Calvert Research and Management (Calvert) and CDP. Sixty-three percent of Fortune 100 companies have set one or more clean energy targets. Nearly half of Fortune 500 companies – 48 percent – have at least one climate or clean energy target, up five percent from an earlier 2014 report. Accompanying this growth is rising ambition, with significant numbers of companies setting 100 percent renewable energy goals and science-based GHG reduction targets that align with the global goal of limiting global temperature rise to below two degrees Celsius. Findings from the new report, “Power Forward 3.0: How the largest U.S. companies are capturing business value while addressing climate change,” are based on 2016 company disclosures to CDP, which holds the world’s largest collection of self-reported corporate environmental data, and other public sources. “American businesses are leading the transition to a clean economy because it’s smart business and it’s what their customers want,” said Marty Spitzer, World Wildlife Fund’s senior director of climate and renewable energy. “Clean energy is fueling economic opportunity from coast to coast without regard for party line. Washington policies may slow this boom, but these companies are making it very clear that a transition to a low-carbon economy is inevitable.” The report highlights the financial benefits companies receive from their clean energy investments: Nearly 80,000 emission-reducing projects by 190 Fortune 500 companies reporting data showed nearly $3.7 billion in savings in 2016 alone. The emission reductions from these efforts are equivalent to taking 45 coal-fired power plants offline every year. Praxair, IBM and Microsoft are among the companies saving tens of millions of dollars annually through their energy efficiency efforts. The 240 companies with targets have set one or more of the following goals: GHG reductions, energy efficiency improvements, or renewable energy sourcing. Two hundred and eleven companies have set a GHG reduction goal, making it the most common target. “We are encouraged to see significant improvement in both the number of Fortune 500 companies setting climate and clean energy goals and the ambition of those goals – in particular commitments to setting science-based and 100 percent renewable energy targets,” said Anne Kelly, senior director of policy and the BICEP network at Ceres. “But in order to meet our national and global emissions goals, more companies will need to join the champions highlighted in this report, both in setting goals and in becoming vocal advocates for continued federal and state policies in support of climate and clean energy progress.” Ten percent (53) of companies have set renewable energy targets, and almost half of those (23) have committed to power 100 percent of their operations with renewable energy – among those, Wal-Mart, General Motors, Bank of America, Google, Apple and Facebook. The growth in the number and ambition of renewable energy commitments is mainly the result of recent sharp declines in renewable energy costs, which saves companies money, and of price certainty that comes with renewable energy. “Corporate commitment to energy efficiency and renewable energy is an accelerating trend that illustrates broader recognition within the business community of the importance of clean energy and the financial benefits it can yield,” said Stu Dalheim, vice president of corporate shareholder engagement for Calvert. “Many of the largest companies in the U.S. are achieving significant cost savings through clean energy programs and mitigating longer-term risks associated with energy price volatility.” Some of the strongest efforts are also among Fortune 100 companies, with nearly two-thirds (63 percent) adopting or retaining goals. The report also shows strong improvement among the smallest 100 companies in the Fortune 500, with 44 percent setting goals in one or more categories, up 19 percentage points from the 2014 report. The report shows a significant spread in target setting among different sectors, with Consumer Staples (72%), Materials (66%), and Utilities (65%) sectors leading in setting clean energy goals and the Energy sector (11%), including oil & gas companies, significantly lagging. “CDP and the investors we work with, representing over US$100 trillion in assets, engage thousands of the world’s largest companies to measure and manage climate-related risks” said Lance Pierce, president of CDP North America. “Voluntary corporate disclosure highlights the compelling business case for corporate clean energy procurement and clearly demonstrates the transition underway in the energy markets. Companies in turn have benefited, identifying billions of dollars in savings and new opportunities through their disclosures to CDP.” The report includes key recommendations for companies, policymakers and investors to continue to scale clean energy efforts, such as: Companies should continue to set, implement and communicate clean energy targets, while supporting local, state and national policies that make it easier to achieve their climate and energy commitments. Federal and state policymakers should establish clear, long-term low-carbon polices that will help companies meet their clean energy targets while also helping the U.S. meet its carbon-reducing commitments under the Paris Climate Agreement. Investors should consider allocating their investments to companies well-positioned for the low-carbon economy. Investors should continue to file shareholder resolutions and engage in dialogues with companies to encourage them to set climate and energy efficiency targets and position themselves for a low-carbon future.

Its mission is to create solutions for developing the next generation of skilled talent necessary to drive innovation and economic growth within a global context. The summit is led by STEMconnector,® the leading organization working with industry, higher education, NGOs and the public sector to provide resources and leadership that supports smart STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) investments. This year's theme is short-term STEM talent development strategies and impact on business performance. "We are building off the success of last year's first-ever employer-led annual Global STEM Talent Summit and bringing together major industry partners to address the STEM talent gap that exists in our country—and globally," said Dr. Heidi Kleinbach-Sauter, Senior Vice President, Global R&D, PepsiCo, and Chairwoman of the Global STEM Talent Summit. "We have fully transitioned from STEM theory into action and our industry partners are implementing STEM talent development strategies to deliver sustainable enterprise growth." Several keynotes will present a call to action, such as Jan Geldmacher, President of Sprint Business, in conjunction with "Pepper," the intelligent humanoid robot. Jay Bavisi, CEO, EC-Council, will address why we must upskill STEM talent for the projected 8.1 million global cyber jobs, with two million in the USA alone.  Surya Kant, President, North America, UK and Europe Operations, Tata Consultancy Services, challenged last year's summit participants to work on supporting one million tech jobs for the underserved, and he returns in 2017 to build on the digital fluency priority. "Digital technologies are transforming every industry around the world, including manufacturing, banking, retail, and healthcare. Companies are adopting the forces of cloud and automation to make their enterprise far more agile and responsive, in order to provide superior experiences to their end consumers," says Surya. "In this new world order, companies across almost all sectors need talent with a combination of digital fluency, innovation excellence, and employability skills."

"Ensuring a robust and sustainable pipeline of stem talent is key to drive innovation in industries and economies all over the world," said Seema Kumar, Vice President, Innovation, Global Health and Science Policy Communication, Johnson & Johnson. "Great innovative ideas can come from anywhere, and our opportunity is to cultivate a broad base of stem talent that is inclusive and diverse. The future of our economy… and our world… depends on it."

According to the new documents, Loyd arrived at the Walmart where he’s accused of shooting Lt. Debra Clayton on Jan. 9 at 6:45 a.m. Related Headlines Court hearing for murder suspect Markeith Loyd canceled Murder suspect Markeith Loyd gets public defender, waives right to speedy trial State files new motions of evidence against Markeith Loyd While inside the store, a woman, who said she’s the cousin of Loyd’s wife, recognized him. The woman ran to tell Clayton, who was also shopping in the store. Loyd was already being sought in the shooting death of his pregnant ex-girlfriend, Sade Dixon, and the shooting of her brother, who was trying to help her. At 7:17 a.m., Clayton radioed to dispatch, “I guess we’re looking for a Markeith. He’s walking out of the door right now.” At 7:18 a.m., Clayton said, “Foot pursuit, foot pursuit.” Less than a minute later, an officer radioed, “Officer down, officer shot. Hurry up.” Clayton died about 20 minutes later after being shot four times. The medical examiner said the last shot, which was fired after Clayton was on the ground, was the one that killed her. Two days later, investigators searched the car Loyd ditched soon after the shooting. Inside, they found toiletries, including a toothbrush, indicating he may have been living inside the vehicle. They also found a cellphone, which investigators used “in the apprehension efforts to locate Markeith Loyd,” a report said. The reports also detail that investigators tapped Loyd’s phone and the phones of people with whom he associated. Loyd was found Jan. 17 in an abandoned home on Lescott Lane. Investigators found nearly 11 pages of handwritten notes that “gave a detailed account of what has transpired up to the killing of Sade Dixon and the shooting of her brother." Police said Loyd wrote the death of his unborn child was an unintended consequence. Documents show he was questioned inside headquarters for about 40 minutes before he was taken to the hospital. Loyd was combative and complained about injuries he sustained during the arrest. The documents also included text messages between Dixon and Loyd before she was shot and killed. They both accuse the other of cheating. In one message from Loyd on Dec. 10, he said, “What I wanted was to spend my life with someone that I trust with my life, but you can’t even be trusted with your word.” Dixon later responded with, “I have no problem telling you the trust, but how can I do that when this whole relationship is built off a lie?” The two texted multiple times on Dec. 13, the day she was killed. About 20 minutes before her death, the conversation became more heated, with Loyd saying, in part, “All you had to do was answer my calls, but you was doing you.” That was at 8:42 p.m. The first 911 call after Dixon was shot came in at 9:03 p.m. At 9:24 p.m., police said Loyd wrote, “Don’t know if you go make it, hope you don’t. Told you don’t play with me.” When police arrested Loyd, they said he claimed Dixon pulled a gun on him, and that he was mad because she was smoking while pregnant. As police continued to question Loyd, he told them, “I ain’t talking until I get medical attention. I need medical attention.” He ended the interview by saying, “I’m a good guy.”  © 2017 Cox Media Group.

(AP) - Police in Tennessee say two men were shot, one fatally, during a confrontation with bail bondsmen in a Walmart parking lot. The Leaf Chronicle (http://leafne.ws/2pi8xmp ) quotes family members as saying 24-year-old Jalen Johnson died Sunday as a result of the shooting in Clarksville. They said Johnson didn't have any outstanding warrants and they're demanding justice. Clarksville Police spokesman Jim Knoll says an investigation is underway. Clarksville police said in a statement that the bail bondsmen believed a man with warrants they were serving was inside a Nissan at the parking lot. Gunshots broke out before the Nissan fled the scene with the bondsmen chasing in two separate vehicles. Police didn't say who fired shots and haven't identified the bondsmen or the men inside the Nissan. The second man wasn't killed. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

A 75-year-old Walmart greeter in Clarksville, Indiana suffered a nasty injury after a confrontation with a shoplifter left her on the ground. Store greeter Patricia Wilson was working an early morning shift at the retail giant in late March when she spotted a man trying to leave the store with a full cart. Related: United Airlines Engine Blows Out Over The Ocean! The employee spotted "large merchandise" hidden under bathroom tissue, and as customary of her job, went to make sure everything was paid for. She explained via phone call to WDRB: "He has a cart full, I mean, large merchandise underneath some bathroom tissue. So, I went over to him and asked for his receipt. He didn't say a word … he just automatically turned the cart towards me, and I thought he was going to knock me over, so, my instinct was to grab hold." That's when things took a painful turn, as the suspect sharply pulled the cart away from the elderly worker and sent her falling to the floor, landing her one agonizing hip injury. She added: "I landed on my hip. I couldn't move, I felt like I was paralyzed." Clarksville Police say the incident happened around 4 in the morning. Officials are trying to identify the suspect, who faces more than just a shoplifting charge. Related: Tom Hardy Takes Down Thief Until The Cops Arrived! Detective Ray Hall told local press: "Since he forcibly took the product from a Walmart employee, he will be charged with strong arm robbery." As for Wilson, who left the scene on a stretcher with a broken hip, she seems to regret trying to be a hero, noting: "I would never try to stop him or anything, but I do regret asking for his receipt." Well, that is her job, after all. But are Walmart greeters also supposed to double as bodyguards? Let's hope the chain titan does a better job at keeping its employees safe.

Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. See All Comments How Chris Soules' Criminal Past Could Turn A Fatal Car Crash Into Murder Charges Chris Soules' arrest Monday night isn't his first time getting in trouble with the law. And that could make his punishment this time around far worse. The former Bachelor star was originally charged with fleeing the scene of a fatal accident, a class D felony. But later on alcoholic beverage containers were found in his possession. Even for someone with a spotless record, driving under the influence could bring far greater consequences. But Chris doesn't have a clean record. Related: Read 'Devastated' Chris Soules' First Public Statement Following Crash He reportedly was busted for minor in possession of alcohol in 2001 (when he was 19-20 years old), for unlawful use of a license in 2002, and seven times for speeding between 2000-2012. He was even charged with leaving the scene of an accident once before in 2002, but that was later amended. But those violations pale in comparison to the bust that could damn him to a murder charge. As we previously reported, he's already been busted for a DUI (though it was called an OWI in Iowa) back in 2005. He got 60 days in jail, a year probation, and a fine of $500. Doesn't seem like much of a penalty to us. But it could change everything for him now. Legal expert Troy Slaten explained to E!

At 36 feet long, with a diameter/aperture of 2 feet, the instrument is tied for the sixth-largest refracting telescope in the U.S., according to a Supporting STEM & Space press release. Supporting STEM & Space plans to use it as the centerpiece for a STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) education center with a planetarium and observatory. The idea for the facility has been in the works with the organization since its inception two years ago. “Having this donated means we will likely be able to move forward our final plans probably by several years,” said Katherine Auld, chairman of the board of directors, adjunct faculty member at Northwest Arkansas Community College and NASA/JPL Solar System Ambassador. Auld is hopeful the project will come together soon. “Let’s see if we can break ground in two years. That’s probably way too ambitious, but I think we should push for it and be ambitious,” Auld said. The 36-foot-long telescope was made by the John A. Brashear Company in Pittsburgh in 1911. An agreement between the organization and Swarthmore College stipulates that the school will pay for disassembling and loading the telescope, while Supporting STEM & Space is tasked with handling transport to Northwest Arkansas. The organization estimates the cost, with insurance, will be about $20,000. Supporting STEM & Space launched a GoFundMe site on Monday (April 24) to help raise money for the effort. EXOPLANET RESEARCH Supporting STEM & Space board Vice Chairman Clint Branham, senior systems engineer of cyber security at Wal-Mart Stores, made a trip to see the telescope in person after attending the Northeast Astronomical Forum in nearby Suffern, N.Y. Branham also met with Swarthmore College officials on the trip and spoke with individuals who serviced the telescope in 2005 for an assessment of the requirements to complete the restoration project. “It is hard to describe how big this telescope is,” Branham said in the press release. “However big you think it is, it’s bigger than that.” The long‐focus refracting telescope is tied with the 24-inch Clark telescope at Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Ariz., as the sixth-largest, according to the release. The tube of heavy sheet steel is bolted to a cast iron centerpiece mount and pier. It is now in a 45‐foot diameter dome at Swarthmore. The telescope was once used in astronomical photography and by 1974 it had been used to take 100,000 photos on 5‐inch by 7‐inch glass plates. The camera used to create those plates is now in the collection of The Smithsonian Institution, according to Supporting STEM & Space. The telescope was made by the John A. Brashear Company in Pittsburgh in 1911. Originally housed in the Sproul Observatory, it is tied to the earliest claims of the detection of an exoplanet by Peter van de Kamp in 1963, according to the organization. $250,000 RESTORATION PROJECT Auld found out a few months ago about the telescope through an email she received as a member of the International Planetarium Society. Planning to use the building housing the telescope for another purpose, Swarthmore College was accepting proposals for the next phase of the telescope’s life, and once the board of Supporting STEM & Space learned that the college was willing take on the significant cost of disassembling the telescope, the two signed an agreement April 19. “I am thrilled that Sara Schnecher, committee member of the American Astronomical Society Working Group for the Preservation of Astronomical Heritage, had the vision to find this telescope a new home where it can continue to inspire the people of Northwest Arkansas in their STEM‐focused efforts for years to come,” Auld said in the release. Supporting STEM & Space plans to restore the telescope to operation, upgrade the control system to work with modern computer systems and use it for public outreach. The organization’s long-term goal is to install the piece in an observatory and science center, although definite plans have not yet been made. Auld estimates that restoring the telescope to immaculate condition would cost about $250,000. As far as fundraising and building the science center, Auld said: “We will go as far as we can, as quickly we can.” SMALLER TELESCOPE SUPPORT In 2016, Supporting STEM & Space launched a local chapter of the Library Telescope Project, which places telescopes available for check out in public libraries, with Bentonville Public Library as the first recipient. On Sunday (April 23) the organization announced the addition of eight other libraries to receive telescopes, including facilities in Bella Vista, Gravette, Prairie Grove, Springdale, West Fork, Rogers and Fayetteville, according to the organization. Other Supporting STEM & Space board members include Penny Holland (secretary), sixth‐grade science teacher at Bentonville Public Schools; Blaine Sanders (treasurer), fifth‐grade science teacher at Fayetteville Public Schools and founder of SpareChangeYourLife; Dr. Daniel Barth, assistant professor of STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) education and director of the Astronomy for Educators program at the University of Arkansas; Larry Cooper, high school science teacher at Springdale Public Schools; Dr. Anne Diallo, visiting assistant professor in  political science at the UA; Kent Marts, editor and publisher of the weeklies division at Northwest Arkansas Newspapers; Dustin Masterson, cyber security analyst at Walmart; Scott Roberts, founder of Explore Scientific in Springdale; and Kathrine Trovini, delivery driver at Enchanted Designs.

The conference aims at building support for investment in women's economic empowerment programs. Michael Sohn/AP | Caption Loading... Schuyler Velasco Staff writer | @Schuyler_V April 25, 2017 —Is the right way to build a female-friendly workplace really from the top down? Headlines and corporate discussions about working women typically focus at the top: statistics about female CEOs, the number of women on Forbes’ billionaires list, profiles of individual icons like Facebook CEO Sheryl Sandberg of “Lean In” fame and Ivanka Trump, whose “Women who Work” brand includes self-help books and a fashion line. Individuals like Ms. Sandberg and Ms. Trump do bring greater visibility to the obstacles working women of all stripes face, says Julia Beck, a marketing strategist and founder of Forty Weeks, a consulting firm that focuses on pregnant women. “This issue remaining in the headlines does move the dialogue forward, and both are presenting a level of optimism” that they can be solved, she says. “But are either of them creating something realistic for a large swath of the population?" she asks. "We don’t want a place where most women don’t feel included in that conversation.” On Tuesday, Trump joined German Prime Minister Angela Merkel at the W20 Summit in Berlin, as part of a panel conversation on Women’s Empowerment and Leadership. She was booed for defending her father’s treatment of women. But aside from President Trump's past indecorous remarks, the event is in keeping with the theme of Ivanka Trump’s work within her father’s White House so far, and her personal brand before that: a conversation on women’s empowerment, held by and largely concerning women with a lot of power. The panel’s other participants included Queen Maxima of the Netherlands, Christine LaGarde of the International Monetary Fund, and Bank of America vice chairman Anne Finucane, among others. Who owns Gatorade: Coke or Pepsi? Take our 'parent company' quiz! Critics say the attention on the needs of women, and particularly mothers, who are already in the upper echelons of power ignores more serious problems faced by the vast majority of low- and middle-income working women. Announcements of increasingly generous parental leave policies for high-skilled employees at companies like Google and Etsy don’t trickle down to, say, the people working in warehouses for Amazon or on the floor at Wal-Mart. But a growing number of companies – from stalwarts such as Campbell Soup to start-ups like Birchbox – are taking a more comprehensive look at their policies. “It’s important that good policies and practices aren’t reserved for professional staff,” says Dina Bakst, a women’s rights attorney and founder of A Better Balance, a legal advocacy organization based in New York. There are women “who are one sick child away from losing their job, or one complicated pregnancy away from homelessness,” she says. “We want to improve corporate policies, yes, but we also need to address the barriers that hold all women back.” That can’t be done by relying on a few high-profile CEOS to change conditions for all women. For one, a female CEO  and generous benefits do not automatically equal a family-friendly work culture, as employees at Yahoo can attest. Sandberg, who changed bereavement policies at Facebook after losing her spouse, has acknowledged that it took personal experience for her to more fully understand the challenges some of her employees were going through. “There’s a famous story where Sheryl Sandberg went into her manager’s office at Facebook and demanded pregnancy parking,” Ms. Bakst says. “That’s great, but the reality is, we have pregnant clients who can’t carry a water bottle on the job and are hospitalized for dehydration, or are not allowed to take bathroom breaks.” But the focus on elite professional women is not without its benefits, experts say. “The thinking is that getting women into top positions can’t be separated from making the workplace more welcoming to parents at all levels,” says Krista Carothers, the executive research director of Working Mother magazine, in an email. The publication curates an annual list of major companies with family-friendly policies. “They can't develop a pipeline of female talent to move into executive roles if their women employees drop out at mid-level or have to turn down challenging projects.” Hollow values? In addition to being limited, that kind of top-down corporate feminism can ring hollow when the image doesn’t match up with a company’s practices. In March, Mira Agrawal, the founder and CEO of underwear company Thinx, faced allegations of sexually harassing, underpaying, and offering scant benefits packages to female staffers, despite the company’s message of female empowerment and Ms. Agrawal’s fraught emergence as a feminist role model. Trump’s company (from which she has given up a more active role and taken up an unpaid post in her father’s administration) does offer its corporate employees paid parental leave, but G-III, the company that licenses her fashion line, does not. Additionally, the maternity leave plan Ivanka Trump championed during the presidential election was roundly criticized: first, for being designed as an income tax credit for new mothers, meaning the burden of child care was placed squarely on women; and secondly, because there was no benefit for lower-income families who paid no income tax and were most likely to need financial help with child care. “Ivanka Trump talks about ‘maternity leave,’ and that would be terrible,” Bakst says. “Mommy policies risk encouraging discrimination.” What’s better, she says, are policies are that apply neutrally to all parents, regardless of gender. What’s being done Some companies have tackled the challenge of keeping women of all economic levels attached to the workforce – making it easier for women with changes big and small like affordable childcare, flexible hours, and paid leave policies accessible to rank and file employees – not just those in the C-suite. For example, some firms, including makeup subscription company Birchbox and eyeglasses startup Warby Parker, don’t allow meetings to start before 9:30 a.m. or after 4:30 p.m., so childcare pickup and drop-off schedules aren’t affected. More predictable scheduling practices for hourly workers, including the phasing out of so-called “on-call scheduling,” have been instituted at many retail and restaurant chains, prompted by legislative pressure from state and local governments. Extending parental leave benefits to hourly employees is still rare (only 12 percent of private sector workers in the United States have access, according to the Department of Labor), but it’s gaining traction. Companies including IKEA, Netflix, and Danny Meyer’s Union Square Hospitality Group now do so. Some companies go even further, financially: Campbell Soup Company offers onsite, subsidized day care to employees at its headquarters in Camden, N.J., as well as emergency babysitting services.   Even Trump’s approach has evolved in recent months. According to The New York Times, Trump administration officials are at least weighing a parental leave plan that could include all birth and adoptive parents, and a childcare tax credit that would be refundable for low-income workers – addressing two major criticisms of the Trump campaign’s initial plan.

She applauds the expansion of paid sick-time laws in several states in recent years, as well as a New York state policy, taking effect in 2018, that extends 12 weeks of paid family leave to all workers. “Our policies are stuck in a very different world,” she says. “When you allow the policies to catch up, then we can get to the conversation around quality of life” that is the focus of the Trumps and Sandbergs of the world. “Too many workers aren’t able even to get to that question.” Did this story deliver on 'paths to progress'?    Thanks for your feedback.

A post shared by Ellen (@theellenshow) on Apr 17, 2017 at 12:36pm PDT The world is inarguably a better place with 2016 Presidential Medal of Freedom recipient Ellen Degeneres in it. Case in point: the talk show host regularly surprises her more socially disadvantaged guests with jaw-dropping, (keyword:) useful gifts. Remember that time she and Walmart handed out college scholarships to the entire senior class of a Brooklyn charter school? The woman puts Michael Scott to shame. For her latest act of awesomeness, Ellen invited 12-year-old singing sensation Reuben de Maid on her show. Reuben, who hails from Llandaff, Wales, blew the audience away with his rendition of “And I Am Telling You I’m Not Going” before sitting down to chat with Ellen about makeup, which he loves “just as much as singing.” “Ever since I was eight, I [have been] so interested,” explained the aspiring makeup mogul. “And I [would] watch my phone for hours on end just learning from tutorials, like blogs, and seeing how to do it.” (That time investment certainly paid off  — his contour rivals Kylie’s.) Unfortunately, when Reuben wore makeup to school, many of his peers reacted unkindly. “I used to get bullied a lot,” he told Ellen. “I had friends, but not a lot. In my drama group, I used to get hit, punched and kicked…Then after two months, I tried to brush it off, but brushing it off just doesn’t work. So I stood up to them and I told my mom.” Needless to say, Ellen’s response was on point. “Good for you for not stopping being who you are,” she said. “The fact that just because you want to wear makeup, that somebody thinks they have to hit you or even call you names — it’s not hurting anybody, it’s what you want to do. And you look fantastic.” What happened next? To help Reuben achieve his dream of becoming the next, say, James Charles, Ellen presented the prodigy with his own super-luxe makeup tutorial station, featuring a desk, a new laptop and a lighting kit (very necessary). Watch Reuben’s reaction in the video below, then follow his soon-to-explode YouTube channel for further updates.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 25 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Leading Energy Storage and Ice Rink Provider CALMAC Celebrates its 70th Anniversary /EINPresswire.com/ — FAIR LAWN, NJ–(Marketwired – Apr 25, 2017) – CALMAC®, a leader in cool energy technologies, today celebrates its 70th anniversary. Founded in 1947, Calvin ‚Cal’ MacCracken started the company to pursue his love of inventing. Prior to founding CALMAC, Cal designed and throttled the first jet engine ever built by GE. During his 50 years with CALMAC, he created over 250 inventions and had 80 patents. Some of his most widely known to the public include a hot dog cooker called Roll-A-Grill and the award-winning Alumazorb low emissivity ceiling, which has saved hundreds of millions of kWhs for ice rinks around the world. In addition to being a prolific inventor, Cal was an industry icon who was honored by ASHRAE and inducted into the ASHRAE Hall of Fame for his pioneering work in energy conservation through energy storage and ice rinks. Cal was so far head of his time, that on a „futuristic” 1953 T.V. show entitled 2000 A.D., Cal correctly predicted, in detail, the coming of the Solar Age. CALMAC was the originator of the IceMat® Ice Rink Floor, which creates perfectly uniform ice with dramatic reduction in pumping power. IceMat rolls out like a carpet and connects to a refrigeration unit for quick installation at both temporary and permanent ice rinks. This flexible design has since become the industry standard for ice rinks.  CALMAC’s most widely applied product is IceBank® energy storage which functions like an affordable, simple and reliable battery for a building’s air-conditioning system. IceBank® saves dramatically on the cost to cool buildings by reducing a building’s on-peak use of electricity. The IceBank ice battery system uses standard cooling equipment plus an energy storage tank to shift all or a portion of a building’s cooling needs to off-peak, nighttime hours. During off-peak hours, ice is made and stored inside IceBank energy storage tanks. The stored ice is then used to cool the building the next day. IceBank® offers a critical service to grid, since air-conditioning is the main culprit behind spikes in peak electrical demand. This on-peak reduction decreases the need to build new power plants or turn on expensive „peaker” power plants. The award-winning product has received many accolades including the Buildings Money-Saving Products Award and Building Operating Management Top Products Award. Used by over 4,000 businesses in 60 countries, CALMAC has over 1GW of energy storage worldwide and has built a prestigious list of customers including Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs, Google, Kohl’s, IBM, IKEA, McDonald’s, Morgan Stanley, Nordstrom, Rockefeller Center, Wal-Mart and more. The company’s customers range from school districts, universities and places of worship to government buildings, retailers and medical centers. One customer for example, St. Lucie County School District, has reduced utility costs by $5 million a year thanks to CALMAC. „As a school district located in South Florida, consistently hot temperatures and high humidity rates makes cooling 6.5M square feet of buildings and 40,000 students one of our biggest priorities and biggest expenses,” said Marty Sander, Executive Director of Growth Management, Land Acquisition, Inter-Governmental Relations, Facilities & Maintenance at St. Lucie County School District. „We pair high efficiency chillers with CALMAC’s energy storage technology for hybrid cooling system that shaves peak demand and reduces our utility bill. Before working with CALMAC, we ranked 60th out of 67 school districts statewide for energy use per student. Now, we have moved to 16 in the state and have reduced our energy costs from $12M to $7M per year. Not only are we saving money, but now we can budget for an extra 100 teachers.” As changes in business and the energy landscape occur, CALMAC’s ice based energy products continue to meet the challenges of today’s energy and facility managers. IceMat ice rinks are growing as a major player in retrofit markets with flexible, affordable engineered solutions for indoor and outdoor rinks. IceBank energy storage remains a leading thermal storage solution. Although storing energy in ice has been applied for over 40 years, there have been a number of internal and external factors that have led to a renewed interest in ice storage in the past decade. Materials of construction and manufacturing practices have increased the durability and life of the IceBank product, while growth of renewable energy and the green building market has turned the spotlight on the energy storage marketplace.  „In the mid-1970s, I joined the company because of its focus on solar energy,” said Mark MacCracken, son of Cal MacCracken and now CEO of CALMAC. „CALMAC’s development of IceBank became the top priority in the 1980’s. In the 1990’s, Demand Side Management was critical to the electric utilities and ice storage became a common tool to lower customer costs and decrease peak demand. As popularity for renewable energy rose following the development of LEED in the 2000s, the need for demand flexibility of energy storage became even more paramount. I went to Phoenix in 2009 to attend the GreenBuild Expo and was elected to be Chairman of the Board of Directors of US Green Building Council — ironically in the same city where my father attended the first Solar Energy Convention in 1955. It was an honor to be elected to run the most impactful non-profit organization in the sustainable marketplace in the same location my father launched CALMAC into it 54 years prior. He was truly ahead of his time.” In April 2017, Mark MacCracken was also recognized by City and State New York as an honoree of the Corporate Social Responsibility Award for Sustainability and Environmental Impact for his success in promoting sustainability initiatives in the energy sector as well as devoting his time to creating a positive environmental impact. For more information on CALMAC, visit www.calmac.com. About CALMAC Since 1947, CALMAC Corp has been a leading U.S. manufacturer of cool energy related technologies. CALMAC is most known for its IceBank energy storage systems which strengthens the smart grid by storing critical energy sources — including renewables like wind power — for later use. IceBank energy storage tanks are installed at over 4,000 locations in 60 countries and last over 40 years. CALMAC’s IceMat and Alumazorb products are found in hundreds of rinks worldwide. Customers trust CALMAC for the best ice skating surfaces under any conditions — and lower construction and operating costs. Widely recognized for promoting peak energy conservation and energy cost savings, CALMAC Corp is a member of the Ice Skating Institute, U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) and the New Buildings Institute.

Yes, a cross between a croissant and a tortilla poised to make some noise. Kinda like the cruffin. “I missed the cruffin. I don’t know where I was,” Hoda Kotab told her “Today” show co-host Kathy Lee Gifford. Moving on to April 25: National Crotilla Day. The flaky tortilla will be available exclusively at Wal-Mart. A company blog post says the company worked with one of its suppliers to create a trendy food that would appeal to on-the-go millennials craving new food experiences. The buttery pastry is baked fresh in the stores’ bakeries everyday. It’s also value priced: $4.18 for eight Crotillas. The Crotilla has already received a plug in Food & Wine as a “flatbread fusion” that’s the perfect platform for a Mexican-inspired breakfast. We received our Crotillas and I flagged members of the newsroom to conduct an informal taste test. We tried the pastry both straight from the box and toasted. Here are their comments: “It gives more deference to the croissant than the tortilla, but I like it. It could make great hors d’oeuvres.” “Tastes like a croissant and a biscuit. I get no tortilla. It tastes like flat puff pastry. It’s in the genre of baked goods that’s not worth the calories.” (250 calories per, plus 14 grams of fat.) “Nice and buttery.” “I could eat a load of this. It’s easy on the mouth.” “Significantly better toasted.” “There’s nothing better than fried dough.” “Crisp it up. It needs crunch.” (We put them in the toaster — even thought they don’t fit in the slot — and nearly everyone was unanimous that they tasted better toasted. We also put one in the microwave; not suggested as it toughens the flaky pastry.) “It’s like a Toaster Strudel without the (filling).” “I’m in. I’m thinking of what to put with it …” (I brought Nutella to the party, but the response chorus included: anything, hot dogs, pastrami, hummus, artichoke dip, smoked salmon, cream cheese, beer) Check Wal-Mart’s Facebook at 2 p.m. Tuesday, when they will go live to preview viewer-submitted pairing ideas.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 25 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Report: Fortune 500 Companies Accelerating Renewable Energy, Energy Efficiency Efforts WASHINGTON, DC, April 25, 2017 – Despite efforts in Washington to sideline action on climate change, a growing number of Fortune 500 companies are taking increasingly ambitious steps to reduce their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, procure more renewable energy and reduce their energy bills through energy efficiency, according to a new report released today from World Wildlife Fund (WWF),Ceres, Calvert Research and Management (Calvert) and CDP.   Sixty-three percent of Fortune 100 companies have set one or more clean energy targets. Nearly half of Fortune 500 companies – 48 percent – have at least one climate or clean energy target, up five percent from an earlier 2014 report. Accompanying this growth is rising ambition, with significant numbers of companies setting 100 percent renewable energy goals and science-based GHG reduction targets that align with the global goal of limiting global temperature rise to below two degrees Celsius. Findings from the new report, “Power Forward 3.0: How the largest U.S. companies are capturing business value while addressing climate change,” are based on 2016 company disclosures to CDP, which holds the world’s largest collection of self-reported corporate environmental data, and other public sources. “American businesses are leading the transition to a clean economy because it’s smart business and it’s what their customers want,” said Marty Spitzer, World Wildlife Fund’s senior director of climate and renewable energy. “Clean energy is fueling economic opportunity from coast to coast without regard for party line. Washington policies may slow this boom, but these companies are making it very clear that a transition to a low-carbon economy is inevitable.” The report highlights the financial benefits companies receive from their clean energy investments: Nearly 80,000 emission-reducing projects by 190 Fortune 500 companies reporting data showed nearly $3.7 billion in savings in 2016 alone. The emission reductions from these efforts are equivalent to taking 45 coal-fired power plants offline every year. Praxair, IBM and Microsoft are among the companies saving tens of millions of dollars annually through their energy efficiency efforts. The 240 companies with targets have set one or more of the following goals: GHG reductions, energy efficiency improvements, or renewable energy sourcing. Two hundred and eleven companies have set a GHG reduction goal, making it the most common target. “We are encouraged to see significant improvement in both the number of Fortune 500 companies setting climate and clean energy goals and the ambition of those goals – in particular commitments to setting science-based and 100 percent renewable energy targets,” said Anne Kelly, senior director of policy and the BICEP network at Ceres. “But in order to meet our national and global emissions goals, more companies will need to join the champions highlighted in this report, both in setting goals and in becoming vocal advocates for continued federal and state policies in support of climate and clean energy progress.” Ten percent (53) of companies have set renewable energy targets, and almost half of those (23) have committed to power 100 percent of their operations with renewable energy – among those, Wal-Mart, General Motors, Bank of America, Google, Apple and Facebook. The growth in the number and ambition of renewable energy commitments is mainly the result of recent sharp declines in renewable energy costs, which saves companies money, and of price certainty that comes with renewable energy. “Corporate commitment to energy efficiency and renewable energy is an accelerating trend that illustrates broader recognition within the business community of the importance of clean energy and the financial benefits it can yield,” said Stu Dalheim, vice president of corporate shareholder engagement for Calvert. “Many of the largest companies in the U.S. are achieving significant cost savings through clean energy programs and mitigating longer-term risks associated with energy price volatility.” Some of the strongest efforts are also among Fortune 100 companies, with nearly two-thirds (63 percent) adopting or retaining goals. The report also shows strong improvement among the smallest 100 companies in the Fortune 500, with 44 percent setting goals in one or more categories, up 19 percentage points from the 2014 report. The report shows a significant spread in target setting among different sectors, with Consumer Staples (72%), Materials (66%), and Utilities (65%) sectors leading in setting clean energy goals and the Energy sector (11%), including oil & gas companies, significantly lagging.   “CDP and the investors we work with, representing over US$100 trillion in assets, engage thousands of the world’s largest companies to measure and manage climate-related risks” said Lance Pierce, president of CDP North America. “Voluntary corporate disclosure highlights the compelling business case for corporate clean energy procurement and clearly demonstrates the transition underway in the energy markets. Companies in turn have benefited, identifying billions of dollars in savings and new opportunities through their disclosures to CDP.” The report includes key recommendations for companies, policymakers and investors to continue to scale clean energy efforts, such as: Companies should continue to set, implement and communicate clean energy targets, while supporting local, state and national policies that make it easier to achieve their climate and energy commitments. Federal and state policymakers should establish clear, long-term low-carbon polices that will help companies meet their clean energy targets while also helping the U.S. meet its carbon-reducing commitments under the Paris Climate Agreement. Investors should consider allocating their investments to companies well-positioned for the low-carbon economy. Investors should continue to file shareholder resolutions and engage in dialogues with companies to encourage them to set climate and energy efficiency targets and position themselves for a low-carbon future.

Anytime. Anywhere. Build Apps 5x Faster For Half the Cost Enterprise Cloud Computing On Force.com As More Buy Clothes Online, Walmart Eyes a Piece of the Action By Edward Helmore PUBLISHED: APRIL 25 2017 "Founded on Fit, Focused on Style, Built on Service" -- that's the retail promise offered by Bonobos, the men's e-tailing business that's being courted by Walmart and idolized by the garment industry as a model for reviving US retail woes. The $300m acquisition of the chain, which has more than two dozen stores or "guideshops" in key cities like Chicago, New York and Atlanta, is likely to be announced imminently, according to industry sources. If the deal is confirmed it will not only place Bonobos 38-year-old co-founder and CEO Andy Dunn at the forefront of Walmart's online clothing battle with Amazon, but will endorse a hybrid online/bricks-and-mortar vision some hope can be retail's future. US high streets are witnessing a Darwinian winnowing. In recent months hundreds of closures have been announced as retailers including Macy's, Sears, American Apparel and Abercrombie & Fitch have scaled back their bricks and mortar operations in the face of a shift to online shopping. Bonobos offers an alternative. It operates a small number of stores that act as fitting rooms but do not to fulfill orders on site, only from distribution centers. Their locations carry no inventory -- customers try on its slim-fitting, fashion conscious clothes -- ranging from T-shirts and jeans to business suits and black-tie -- for fit and style, and then have their acquisitions shipped to their home from a central warehouse. The stores are as much advertisement as sales floor. Most of Bonobos's sales are done online by people who may never have visited one of their stores. It's an e-tailing hybrid that's become popular with men, who, broadly observed, do not enjoy shopping or require the same level of consideration as their counterparts. "I always hated shopping. It wasn't fun, even for me. But here I just want to buy out the store," said 28-year-old medical student Philip Maynard, outside a Bonobos guide-shop on 5th Avenue in Lower Manhattan. Maynard said it didn't matter to him that he couldn't walk out with his purchases. "They have a good business online, and the stuff comes when they say its going to come, and I've never had a problem returning anything." Bonobos, which was founded in 2007, established its reputation as retailer with jeans and chinos. After several rounds of investment, sales are reported to be around $100m, up from $40m in 2012. The model addresses the online retailers problem of consumers not being able to try on clothes before they buy them, and the traditional retailers issue of delivering good service. As Dunn told Business of Fashion in 2013, he'd worked at Abercrombie & Fitch folding sweaters. "You're basically the inventory manager of the store, being marginally helpful to the customers. It's more of a job about keeping clothes folded than it is about delivering service." Bonobos true innovation may be challenging the belief that the instant gratification of walking out with a purchase is key to the retail experience. "It's not," Dunn said. "It's has been astonishing how little our customer cares." The concept started as a Stanford MBA project involving Dunn and co-founder Brian Spaly with the goal to provide men with better-fitting clothes, and specifically to design and produce chinos that eliminate "Khaki Diaper Butt." Dunn recognized it could be the internet company he was looking for. As he told Coverteur : "Sometimes the future is rooted in the past, which is sort of counter-intuitive. If you think about old school menswear, it was about the tailor around the corner and that one-to-one relationship you had with that person. We are bringing that back." They started with a show room in New York, followed by a 500 sq ft store in Boston. Dunn realized they'd hit on something. "All of a sudden, it was like, this is it, it's going to be these small, service-driven experiential stores where you have one-on-one service and where you keep out the complexity of a lot of inventory, but you can access this incredibly wide assortment." In lower Manhattan, a store associate explained that by not worrying about back of house stuff like inventory they can focus on customer service. "If you're fitted for one suit, then your measurements are good for all out different suits. That makes it easier -- they get sized once and don't have to come back in unless they want to. Customers may stop by every few weeks and get a couple of things, or the men who come in once a season and we just wardrobe them." But, she cautioned, the system might not necessarily work for women, whose requirements around style and color and sizing are more intricate and nuanced. Nor will the Bonobos model solve the retail sector's larger problems, which accounts for around one in 10 American jobs, or the blight affecting the US main street or its declining system of shopping malls. Since October, more than 89,000 retail positions have been lost. According to some estimates, the sector is on track to lose more stores this year than during the great recession of 2008, its problems accelerating even as a consumer confidence is high and unemployment low, suggesting the changes are systemic and not cyclical. But the Bonobos deal illustrates the accelerating arms race between Amazon, valued at $423bn, and Walmart, valued at $222bn. Wall Street might love Amazon more but the Arkansas-based retailer far exceeds Amazon in earnings -- $13.6bn last year to Amazon's $2.4bn -- and it is aggressively expanding its online businesses. Last September, Walmart completed a $3.3bn acquisition of the discount and deals-driven shopping site Jet.com. It has gone on to pay $70m for footwear online retailer ShoeBuy and $51m for outdoor e-tailer Moosejaw, and agreed the acquisition of Modcloth, a vintage-inspired womenswear producer. Jet.com founder Marc Lore, now president and chief executive officer of Walmart's e-commerce arm, rationalized that smaller brands would gain visibility on the larger platforms. "So suddenly what was a certain size business now, overnight, becomes that much bigger," he told WWD. Amazon, meanwhile, has been pumping up its high-end online offerings, making deals with brands including Levi Strauss & Co. Meanwhile, "real" shops are suffering. Outside Bonobos of 5th Avenue, Philip Maynard explained that he used to shop at J Crew and Brooks Brothers but had since switched. "I love the stuff and its perfect for me," showing off a pair chinos. "It's fashionable and work-appropriate. It's half tech and half friendly and approachable." © 2017 Guardian Web under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media. All rights reserved.

T-Mobile Wins Big in Airwaves Auction Next Article > FCA, Google Begin Offering Rides in Self-Driving Cars By Dee-Ann Durbin PUBLISHED: APRIL 25 2017 Fiat Chrysler and Google for the first time will offer rides to the public in the self-driving vehicles they are building under an expanding partnership. The companies announced in the spring of last year that they would build 100 self-driving Chrysler Pacifica hybrids minivans. Those vehicles have been tested in Arizona, California and Michigan. Waymo, Google's self-driving car project, said Tuesday that it will allow hundreds of people in Phoenix to take rides in the vehicles so that it can get feedback on the experience. Phoenix-area residents can apply on Waymo's website. The company also said that it's expanding its fleet to 500 Pacifica hybrids. Waymo -- created by Google in 2009 -- has given rides to the public before in its hometown of Mountain View, California. In 2015, it let a blind man ride around Austin, Texas, in one of its completely self-driving pods. The Phoenix program will be much larger in scale, and it will be the first to use the Pacifica minivans [pictured above]. Waymo isn't the first to put regular passengers in self-driving cars in the race to develop the technology. Ride-hailing company Uber has had self-driving Volvos on the road in Pittsburgh since last fall. Boston startup nuTonomy is giving taxi rides to passengers in Singapore and Boston. In all cases, there is a backup driver behind the wheel. Waymo said it wants to learn where people want to go in a self-driving vehicle, how they communicate with it and what kinds of information and controls they want. Fiat Chrysler builds the Pacifica minivan in Windsor, Canada, just across the border from Detroit. It adds Waymo's self-driving software and hardware, including sensors and cameras, at a facility in Michigan. Fiat Chrysler's U.S. headquarters is in Auburn Hills, Michigan. "This collaboration is helping both companies learn how to bring self-driving cars to market, and realize the safety and mobility benefits of this technology," said Waymo chief John Krafcik in a company release. Michelle Krebs, an executive analyst for the car shopping site Autotrader, says studies have shown that a majority of Americans are still reluctant to ride in a fully self-driving car. Opening Waymo's vehicles to the public will help build riders' confidence, she said. "The key to acceptance is exposure and education," she said. Ultimately, Waymo says, self-driving cars could prevent many of the 1.2 million deaths that occur on worldwide roads each year. Waymo has made clear that it intends to form partnerships with automakers and not build its own self-driving cars. It's also in talks with Honda Motor Co. about a potential collaboration. © 2017 Associated Press under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media. All rights reserved. Image credit: Google/Waymo.

Apr 25, 2017 Asia-Pacific India Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Google+ Email Print Comment Quote Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Google+ Email Print Comment Quote Late last year, Morgan Stanley marked down the valuation of Indian internet “unicorn” Flipkart by 38%, taking it to a low of $5.54 billion compared to the peak $15.5 billion it stood at in 2015. This was the fourth consecutive markdown by the New York-based global financial services firm. Even as the media was full of reports of Sachin and Binny Bansal (the unrelated cofounders of Flipkart) attempting to secure funding from larger firms – Walmart was rumored to be interested – India’s leading e-commerce site sprang a surprise: In early April, it announced fresh funding at a post-transaction valuation of $11.6 billion. Executive chairman Sachin Bansal, who had described the valuation markdowns from Morgan Stanley and others including U.S.-based Vanguard, Fidelity and Valic as “a very uninformed opinion,” stood vindicated. “This deal helps Flipkart secure some strategic investors who can bring technology and operational expertise, something much needed to solidify its market leadership,” says Sandy Shen, research director at Gartner. “This is different from the previous rounds of mostly financial investors. So Flipkart is getting more than just the funding.” More than the valuation, it’s the credentials of the strategic investors who have come in that matter. The biggest slice of the $1.4 billion investment is $700 million from Chinese tech giant Tencent. EBay will invest $500 million. But it is also selling its local operations to Flipkart for $200 million. Microsoft brings up the rear with $200 million. “Today we entered into strategic agreements with three of the world’s biggest tech companies who join us as partners in our Indian e-commerce journey,” said group CEO Binny Bansal in an email to employees. Amazon vs. Flipkart The battle-lines are being drawn in India’s e-commerce arena. On one side is Amazon. During a visit to India, CEO Jeff Bezos said that the company plans to invest an additional $3 billion in its operations in the country to take its outlay in India to over $5 billion. On the other are Flipkart and its backers. Tencent is the largest company by market cap on the Hong Kong stock exchange. Last year, it overtook e-commerce rival Alibaba. The San Jose-based eBay may have given up its India dreams; it will be a part of Flipkart but operate as an independent company. It helps that eBay India will report to Flipkart CEO Kalyan Krishnamurthy, who came to the firm from eBay Asia-Pacific. And Microsoft, which already has a deal with Flipkart for the latter to use its Azure cloud platform, is adding fertilizer for possible future growth in business. The deal comes at a time when the internet space in India — including e-commerce — is undergoing a major shakeout. EBay, which tried to add muscle after its acquisition of fellow e-tailer baazee.com in 2005, is seeing the flip side of takeovers today. Online marketplace ShopClues, which was planning a Nasdaq IPO later this year, has had to push back plans after a cofounder alleged fraud against the rest of the team. Image messaging firm Snapchat, fresh from a successful $3.4 billion IPO in the U.S., is being blackballed in India because of a reported statement by its CEO that he doesn’t “want to expand into poor countries like India and Spain.” (The allegation was made in a lawsuit filed by a former employee in a U.S. court; the company has denied it.) The CEO of homestay platform Stayzilla is out on bail after nearly a month in jail on charges of fraud filed by its vendor Jigsaw Solutions. Jigsaw owner Radha Shekhar has written to New Delhi politicians – including the prime minister — saying that Stayzilla should be investigated “instead of letting them take cover behind the startup ecosystem.” “The real challenge for large Indian companies like Flipkart and Ola is that India’s capital markets aren’t as large and mature as those in the U.S.” –Kartik Hosanagar List of Casualties Then there is online marketplace Snapdeal, facing a financial crisis and being pushed by SoftBank, a Japanese telecommunications and Internet company with major technology-related investments, into a merger with Flipkart. (SoftBank holds a 35% stake in Jasper Infotech, Snapdeal’s parent.) An email to employees by Snapdeal cofounders Kunal Bahl and Rohit Bansal captures all that is wrong with e-commerce in India today: “Over the past two-three years, with all the capital coming into this market, our entire industry, including ourselves, started making mistakes. We started growing our business much before the right economic model and market fit was figured out… [Today] we are combining teams, reducing layers, eliminating non-core projects and strengthening the focus on profitable growth. Let’s remember: GMV (gross merchandise volume) is vanity. Profit is sanity.” A third force seems to be emerging to challenge Amazon and Flipkart. The SoftBank Group is in talks to put in between $1.2 billion and $1.5 billion in electronics payments provider Paytm, making it one of the largest shareholders in the fintech startup. “The deal could increase Paytm’s valuation to $7 billion-$9 billion,” reports Mint business daily. “SoftBank’s potential investment in Paytm and another $1 billion bet on Flipkart is likely to make its chief Masayoshi Son the toughest competitor Bezos will ever have faced in India,” notes The Economic Times. “There are two parallel deals expected in 2017 that could define the way the Indian e-commerce sector moves for at least the next three years.” Alibaba of China is an investor in Paytm e-commerce. Sponsored Content: In this expansion and consolidation process, a lot of questions are being asked. Is it too early for e-commerce to take root in India? Is brick-and-mortar retail going to dominate for many more years to come? Does India need a different e-commerce model? Is “capital dumping” at the core of the problem? Capital Dumping Take capital dumping first. The three prominent voices against capital dumping are Flipkart’s Sachin Bansal, ride services firm Ola cofounder Bhavish Aggarwal, and Vani Kola, managing director of Kalaari Capital, a venture capital (VC) major. Their demand: the government should stop foreign funding of their rivals (like Amazon and Uber) and create a level playing field. “What we need to do is what China did [15 years ago] and tell the world we need your capital, but we don’t need your companies,” said Bansal at a meeting in Bangalore. Added Aggarwal: “The real fight is on capital, not innovation. The markets are being distorted by capital.” “We support free flow of capital that is not only good for customers, but also helps create jobs [and] develop infrastructure, aids the growth of small businesses, and facilitates India’s economic development,” says Amit Agarwal, senior vice president and country head, Amazon India. He has no comment on Flipkart’s capital harvesting. “As a company we are customer focused and not competition obsessed,” he adds. “All e-tailers are desperately trying to get out of this vicious cycle [of discounts]. This is not a sustainable business model.” –Ashis Mishra “Personally, I don’t buy the capital dumping arguments,” says Kartik Hosanagar, Wharton professor of operations, information and decisions. “Small retailers who got crushed by venture-funded startups like Flipkart could have claimed capital dumping back then. Local companies have access to private equity markets and can technically raise lots of capital there if they can convince investors of their long-term potential. The real challenge for large Indian companies like Flipkart and Ola is that India’s capital markets aren’t as large and mature as those in the U.S. So Indian players will find it hard to raise the mammoth funds needed to compete with Western counterparts who commit billions of dollars to India. The solution isn’t to block investment by Western companies, but ask how we can address the capital market challenges faced by private companies.” Adds venture capitalist Mahesh Murthy in a post on LinkedIn: “Of course, the same level playing fields were not deemed necessary by the same VCs when Big Bazaar [a brick-and-mortar retailer] petitioned the government for them against Myntra [an online fashion store] and Flipkart, and when small shopkeepers asked for protection against Snapdeal.” Whether the dumping argument will itself be dumped, one thing is clear: The era of massive discounts in order to grow business has to come to an end. According to Mint, financial 2015-2016 (year ended March) saw Amazon record revenues of Rs2,275 crore (about $350 million) with a loss of Rs3,572 crore ($550 million). Flipkart wasn’t much better. It had revenues of Rs1,952 crore ($300 million) and a loss of Rs2,306 crore ($350 million). “As a company policy we do not comment on financials” says Agarwal. “That being said, we have seen a healthy growth in India. In 2016 we have grown over 100% year-on-year despite demonetization and other headwinds. For Amazon, India is one of the highest priority investments.” (Flipkart did not respond to Knowledge@Wharton’s queries.) “All e-tailers are desperately trying to get out of this vicious cycle,” says Ashis Mishra, professor of marketing at the Indian Institute of Management Bangalore. “This is not a sustainable business model.” No Fundamental Problem “Does India need a different model: I don’t think so,” counters Hosanagar. “There is no fundamental problem with the e-commerce market in India. The case for e-commerce is strong. First, urban areas have traffic congestion issues and high real estate costs, making e-commerce attractive. Smaller towns don’t offer great product selection. The issue in India has been twofold. First, in their intense battle for marketshare, all companies have discounted too aggressively, and that isn’t sustainable in the long run. Second, investors like SoftBank and Tiger Global created a bit of a frenzy by over-investing at unreasonable valuations. These created the current issues and not any supply-demand fundamentals. I imagine all this will get sorted out in the next couple of years.” Others see problems that will take longer to resolve. “India’s online retail market is at an early stage and is lagging compared to many other markets in volume and maturity,” says Shen. “Given the not-so-well-established retail infrastructure, e-commerce is an efficiency channel for merchants to reach out to a wide audience and scale up quickly. As more businesses are moving to the digital channel in a way to follow their customers, e-commerce will see high growth down the road.” She lists some shortcomings of the market: “Some key challenges: User behavior takes time to establish for online shopping (currently more limited to the elite group); product/brand choice ranges are not great; logistics can be difficult in rural and remote areas; and digital payment is not widely established, though demonetization and Aadhaar (the universal biometric identity card) will move this forward quickly.” “India has a multiple economy — that of the metros and big cities, smaller towns and rural area,” says Mishra, who has worked on retail atmospherics and retail consumer behavior. “E-tail in metros and big cities may establish itself after reasonable consolidation in the next two-three years. Smaller towns are just having a taste of modern retailing. Online is catching up; still, it may take five-10 years to be a major force under favorable conditions. In the rural areas, no business model is available yet.” Is trust an issue? “The quality of brands has never been a problem with online retailing,” says Mishra. “Most customers are net savvy and they can search and figure out the quality. However, lack of trust is significant in terms of accuracy of the order, timely delivery, condition [of the goods delivered], ease of cancellation of order and ease of returns. The cash-on-delivery logistics for high-value items, even for lower-value items in smaller towns, is not developed adequately. The order cycle gets elongated unduly as a result. So, both the parties find it is difficult to trust each other.” In the U.S., Amazon was set up in 1994; it went online in 1995. It began by selling books. It took two decades to overtake Walmart in market capitalization – considered a measure of future earnings potential. But the difference between the U.S. and India is that brick-and-mortar retail has yet to come of age in India. In the U.S., stores are closing down (“Are Retailers Facing a Coming ‘Tsunami’?”). Now, in India, both those eras are overlapping. Avenue Supermarts – the owner of the D-Mart retail chain brand – had an IPO in India in March. The shares listed on March 21 at over 100% the IPO price, giving it a valuation higher than all the retail stocks in the country put together. The next player is the Future Group; the market cap of all its listed entities add up to Rs25,000 crore. D-Mart is more than double that. “This deal helps Flipkart secure some strategic investors who can bring technology and operational expertise.” –Sandy Shen D-Mart is among the most expensive global retail stocks (brick-and-mortar), with the price/earnings (P/E) ratio for fiscal 2018 and 2019 at around 56 times and 42 times respectively, according to brokerage firm JP Morgan. Walmart’s P/E ratio is about 17. “The world over, in developed markets including the U.S., physical retail commands over 93% share of modern retail,” says a Future Group spokesperson. “Even in the remaining 7%, more than half is captured through omnichannel operations of physical retailers. Physical retail continues to be the dominant and the most cost efficient channel in India by a huge margin.” Adds Binny Bansal: “E-commerce accounts for less than 2% of all retail in India, and the potential for online retail alone is about $100 billion.” That’s a $100 billion cake waiting to be cut. Small wonder that Flipkart’s Big Billion Day sale last year and Amazon’s Great Indian Festival earlier this year were so successful. “The question isn’t physical or virtual retail,” says a Future Group spokesperson. “Today, as consumers, we live a seamless life, and retailing, too, will be a seamless experience. Like major physical retailers, we have built significant digital interfaces. From conducting major sales events on Twitter, to a full-fledged digital wallet, Future Pay, from omni-channel portals to a large social media presence, we are transforming into a store-led digital organization.” Adds Amazon’s Agarwal: “We believe there is room for multiple formats, players and most importantly, for innovation.” Citing Knowledge@Wharton Close For Personal use: Please use the following citations to quote for personal use: MLA "Funding Flipkart: Can India’s Internet ‘Unicorn’ Take on Amazon?."

But why experiment with growth when you could hack it? Just ask the likes of Airbnb, Pinterest, LinkedIn, Facebook and Uber — not to mention IBM, Walmart, and Microsoft — universally recognizable companies whose brands are permanently embedded in the American psyche. What they all have in common is the methodology laid out in the highly anticipated Hacking Growth: How Today’s Fastest-Growing Companies Drive Breakout Success, authored by Inman COO Morgan Brown and CEO and cofounder of GrowthHackers.com Sean Ellis.

This roadmap for the aggressive upstart, determined entrepreneur and business stuck in the middle provides the practical toolkit necessary for getting out of neutral and onto the highway. Hacking Growth doesn’t leave readers in the theoretical but shows them how to remove the unknowns and replace wasteful big bets with a proof-laced plan built for speed. Eric Ries, bestselling author of The Lean Startup, said of the book: “In an increasingly erratic business landscape where new competition can emerge overnight, customers’ loyalties can shift unexpectedly, and markets are constantly being disrupted, finding growth solutions fast is crucial for survival. “Hacking Growth provides a compelling answer to this urgent need for speed, offering companies a methodology for finding and optimizing new strategies to increase their market share and quickly.” Catch Brown’s keynote address —- “Growth Hacking Your Way To Success” — with live insights from the book at Inman Connect San Francisco in August.

Rachel Cernansky | Apr 25, 2017 Once Upon a Farm has been making waves in the baby food category since its launch about a year and a half ago: It brought the cold-pressed, HPP techniques that have revolutionized the juice sector into the baby food category. It started with local distribution and made headlines again when it turned up on some Target shelves last May. Now, a little over a year into its existence, it continues to change the very makeup of the baby food aisle by enticing stores of all sizes to install refrigerators right in the aisle, which is otherwise stocked with row upon row of shelf-stable products. And the brand is quickly branching out of the natural channel and increasingly into more mainstream stores, including Hy-Vee, Kroger and Wegmans. "Right now we’re primarily in the natural channel, but that’s about to shift," said cofounder and COO Cassandra Curtis, adding that the expansion into the mainstream channel is happening almost on its own—while getting into even three regions of Whole Foods has been something of a struggle. "We’ve had to push and push to get in there, whereas these other accounts are coming to us," she explained. She’s even been approached by Walmart, although it’s too soon to know if that conversation will go anywhere. One sign Once Upon a Farm is succeeding not just in sales but in shifting the category is that retailers are stepping up to meet one of the company’s core challenges, which is almost beyond its control—accommodating the need for refrigeration. The company also deals with buyers for both baby food and dairy, because the products don’t fit easily into either category. "One of the biggest challenges has been finding space in the store because we are pioneering a new category that didn’t exist before," she said. But still, "Stores are taking the initiative to install refrigerators in the baby food section—and stores are reaching out to us." That may be one reason that larger chains are taking more initiative than smaller, more independent stores—because they can more easily afford the burden and expense of installing new refrigerators. But Curtis said it’s built into Once Upon a Farm's model to work with smaller stores in providing their own branded coolers. Stores have also been stocking Once Upon a Farm in other sections—in some cases, next to child-targeted squeezable yogurts, which is a good place to be because that’s already a high-traffic area for parents. But in other cases they’re near, say, hummus, and lower sales in those stores show that’s much less than ideal. Curtis sees Once Upon a Farm really as part of a larger paradigm shift in the category, pointing to other businesses offering things like delivery and subscription services for fresh, organic baby food. Ultimately, she said, she thinks the market for fresh, higher-quality baby food will become bigger than what it’s been for shelf-stable. "It’s very ingrained in our society that baby food should keep and should be this weird foreign substance that adults shouldn’t touch. We’re changing that; we’re offering blends that everyone can eat," she said. "They should be eating the same types of food that adults want to eat." Once Upon a Farm also uses ingredients not often seen in baby foods, such as flax and hemp seeds. "We use healthy fats," Curtis said. "They’re not only important for brain development, but nutrient absorption as well." The company plans to launch a new product—Curtis wouldn’t say what, other than it’s an entirely new type of baby product and not just a new flavor in the existing line—later this year, possibly at Natural Products Expo East.

Danielle Thomas, Elizabeth's sister-in-law, said the 15-year-old appears OK 'at times' but 'there are times where she's curled up in the middle of the floor crying and shaking and having panic attacks.'  Anthony Thomas, Elizabeth's father, added that she is 'very thin and very jittery' after vanishing for 39 days with former teacher Tad Cummins, 50. Danielle Thomas (left and right), the sister-in-law of kidnap teen Elizabeth, has said the girl is suffering panic attacks that leave her curled up on the floor in tears since being found Anthony Thomas, Elizabeth's father (pictured right, alongside eldest daughter Kat Bozeman), said the teen is 'thin and jittery' after her ordeal, and is apprehensive around people Mr Thomas told CNN's Ashleigh Banfield that his daughter was 'the extrovert in a family of introverts', but she is now withdrawn and apprehensive around people. He said the family regularly visit her at the safe house where she is recovering, but they try to keep the conversation light and want to avoid bombarding her with questions about her ordeal. Mr Thomas said it is important that she is given time to heal.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Deadliest Catch star Jacob Harris is arrested for stealing a... Pictured: Neighbor and grandfather-of-three, 66, 'killed' in... Share this article Share Elizabeth, who is from Tennessee, was discovered in a cabin in a remote part of northern California with Cummins on Thursday last week. The pair went missing on March 13. Cummins has since been charged with transporting a minor across state lines for the purpose of criminal sexual intercourse. He is facing a maximum of life if convicted. Daphne Quinn, Cummins' sister, said she spoke with her brother at the weekend and he told her that he only went with the teen because she was planning to run away and he wanted to keep her safe. Reacting to that news, Mr Thomas said: 'If that's his idea of guidance, then he's a very poor excuse for a teacher and authority figure, a father... In fact he's a poor excuse for a human being.' Tad Cummins, 50, Elizabeth's former teacher, is in jail charged with sex crimes and is facing life in jail. His high school freshman victim (right) is recovering in a safe house Cummins and Elizabeth were pictured in a Walmart in Oklahoma City two days after they went missing. They were found five weeks later in California Danielle added that she does not believe Elizabeth knew she was running away for a long time, saying she did not take many clothes with her. The high school freshman also left her dog behind, Danielle said, and was very close to her younger sister Rebecca - to the point where the girl would call her 'mommy'. 'In my heart I don't think she would have left Rebecca for a very long time,' she said. Quinn did not say whether she believes her brother or not, but added: 'He's done this horrible thing, that he has to pay for. But he's still my brother and I love him. 'He's repentant-sounding and I think he would like to get his family back, but I think it just hasn't hit him yet that that's not going to happen.  Prosecutors say Cummins was planning to take Elizabeth in a boat to Mexico, and possibly flee further into South America 'He's going to have to learn a new normal. He's got a very long, tedious route ahead of him in a place that he's never been and he's just going to have to deal with it.'   At Cummins' arraignment on Monday, prosecutors in Sacramento said he planned to take the girl to Mexico in a boat, and possibly further into South America. To prepare for the trip, the teacher test-drove a boat from San Diego to Mexico with the intention of later taking Elizabeth on the same route to evade police. In documents filed in federal court ahead of the hearing, lawyers said he admitted to switching license plates on his car several times and disabling its GPS system to avoid being caught. He paid for essentials - including chocolate for the teenager - with cash and only took back roads to avoid roadside surveillance, the documents say.  Prosecutors said when Cummins and the teen were discovered, there were two guns in his vehicle and at least seven pills of erectile dysfunction drug Cialis.   Cummins spoke only briefly in court to confirm his identity, and agreed to be returned to Tennessee to face trial there.  Cummins and Thomas were found last Thursday after a nationwide manhunt. Police were pointed to them by the caretaker of the cabin. A SWAT team broke in on them in a 4am raid, arresting Cummins and taking Elizabeth to safety. The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation issued an Amber Alert for the schoolgirl in March when she failed to come home after being dropped off at a restaurant. Cummins took Elizabeth from their hometown of Columbia, Tennessee, to a remote cabin in California over the course of five weeks before they were arrested As their hunt for the pair intensified, sickening details of her relationship with the teacher, a grandfather and self-described 'Jesus freak', emerged. The pair left emails for one another on his classroom computer and were seen by other students at the school where he taught kissing in front of his grandson.  Bosses suspended Cummins after police launched an investigation into the claims. The day before they vanished, he was seen on surveillance footage buying women's hair dye. Once on the run, they were spotted again in store surveillance footage in Alabama and then in Oklahoma having both changed their hair and clothes. Numerous reported sightings of the pair were made across the country for weeks as police hunted them. They included reports that the duo were in Corpus Christi, a border town on Texas's south east coast. Police eventually tracked them down on April 20 in a cabin in Siskiyou County, a rural area north of the city of Redding, in California.  Read more: Kidnapped Tennessee teen is withdrawn, jittery, family says - CNN.com Share or comment on this article e-mail Most watched News videos Animal lover smashes car window to free a dog dying in the heat Ex-con fashion model Jeremy Meeks gets denied entry to the UK Schoolboy, 14, fends off angry adult using martial arts Unflinching female tram driver smashes into car on the track Former Southampton striker James Beattie rescues children on yacht Aston Villa fans bully and taunt a couple on train Ian Huntley's daughter Sam says he doesn't deserve to be called dad Shocking video shows drug addict writhing around on street Shocking moment over 60 teenage girls brawl in Florida mall Arkansas executes Jack Jones and Marcel Williams on the same day Dramatic moment speed boat crashes into rocks and flips over Dog has to be rescued after getting head stuck in jar KATIE HOPKINS Kim’s ass hasn’t just broken the internet,...

The reason? The rise of mainstream smartphone and tablet use encroaching on family time. But an influx of new games and interest generated by millennial consumers has revived the time honored tradition. That good news benefits Holyoke, Mass. manufacturer Edaron Inc., which installed its first-ever new paper cutter earlier this month when Colter & Peterson delivered a 54” SABER® machine with Microcut®. Edaron project manager Bob Shevlin said the company is a turnkey subcontractor that services major accounts. Those accounts are responsible for handling all licensing and artwork requirements and Edaron handles the rest, from printing and conversion to shipping to distribution centers throughout North America. Their work can be seen on game shelves at Wal-Mart, Target, Toys R Us and other major retailers. “We procure and laminate the puzzle images to the chipboard, then use the guillotine knives to cut the printed material and prepare it for converting,” said Shevlin, who has worked at the company for 20 years. “We produce millions of puzzles every year, and many are packaged 5-in-1 and 10-in-1 products.” The game industry revival is par for the course for both Edaron, a 41-year-old company, and its home city. Holyoke is a former mill town that in its heyday, once had 26 paper mills feeding off the Connecticut River. Licensing of core brand classic board games like Monopoly, Scrabble and Clue, plus newer games like Disney Frozen and independent board games that have attracted the millennial generation, has spurred the revival that is keeping Edaron’s staff of 150 employees busy. It also signaled time for a cutting department upgrade. “Our guillotine knives were becoming outdated so we did some research on new knives. I got quotes from several companies but Colter & Peterson (www.papercutters.com) was really the only company that was selling knives and providing the services we needed,” recalled Shevlin. “We had four paper cutters at the time, but after speaking with C&P’s Sean Solomon, we scrapped two of them. We bought the SABER and still have a 54” Polar and 52” Lawson. All three of them are serviced by Colter & Peterson, and they did preventive maintenance and updated several things on the other two when the SABER was installed on April 3.” They chose the right new paper cutter. The SABER has a workhorse reputation, delivering highly precise cuts and having the ability to cut several inches of difficult substrates and materials at a time. The computerized Microcut® PLUS system has a 15” programmable touch screen with CIP3 and CIP4 file capability. The automated process guides the back gauge knife into position and memorizes cutting sequences for future use. All told, it often leads to productivity increases. “It’s too early to tell but the SABER is already saving a good amount of time with the work it is cutting. It is a very sturdy machine, the draw is excellent and with the double arm action, we load 5 or 6 inches of material at a time to cut. Our goal is to increase productivity by 25-30%,” acknowledged Shevlin.  “I evaluate equipment by specs and put together a spreadsheet for comparison purposes. For example, the Microcut screen is 15” and the other competitors were only 8-10”. I also liked that we can change the cutting pressure. The software allows you to compensate on the left side, right side or both, so it saves time. The older guillotines could not do this.  “The software also tells you step-by-step how to change out the knives and self-balance it, too,” he continued. “As our staff becomes more familiar with it, they have gained more confidence. With the Microcut programs, we get more definition. It has alpha numeric programs so we can change sheet size for a job, create a new program for every sheet size and assign a number to it for future use. We couldn’t do this with the older machines.  Every time I walk by the SABER cutter, the operators are talking about something new they are doing with it.” Shevlin’s analytics revealed other findings. Edaron uses the SABER to cut 70 or 80 lb. printed litho paper, and its double arm action has led to other time saving measures. That’s a good thing since they currently run five days a week with two shifts. Peak season at the 100,000 square-foot facility begins in late July or early August as activity ramps up for the retail holiday season. It requires a 6-day work week with extended second shifts before slowing down in early December. “We never had a machine with double arm capability or the maximum clamping pressure it has. I also like its cutting depth, and no other manufacturer we considered had it or the clamping pressure,” admitted Shevlin. “The SABER’s width is 54” but it’s also 58” deep. With our older cutters we had to make an extra cut, but the SABER has eliminated that step from the process.”      Tweet       Email    Print    Order Reprints   Post a Comment To post a comment Log In or Become a Member, doing so is simple and free   Industry News RR Donnelley and Xeikon Extend Their Successful Partnership Screen Truepress Jet520HD Helps IWCO Direct’s Clients Get Upfront and "Personalized" Esko at interpack 2017: A Simplified Way to Manage, Design and Produce Packaging Cenveo Announces Conference Call for First Quarter Results and Responds to NYSE Communication HP Inc.

Game Changer: The Remarkable Story of Caroline's Cart, recounts Long's journey from harried mother to manufacturer, negotiator and advocate for special needs children. It is available today in hardback on Amazon.com, whitecapsmedia.com, and as an ebook from Apple and Amazon.com (also Amazon Prime).  The official launch party will be held at Innovation Depot on May 11 at 11 a.m. "Caroline's Cart started as a drawing on a napkin, and through nine years of hard work and lessons learned, it has become a staple in stores like Target, Wal-Mart, Best Buy, Kroger and Home Depot," Long says. "With the book, I wanted to share the story of how the commitment and hard work became a game changer for many in need around the world, and to challenge readers to become game changers in their own lives.  From my first meetings at University of Alabama (UAB) in 2009 and my early collaboration with Innovation Depot, Caroline's Cart has grown to be a widely used accessible shopping option for the special needs community." Game Changer: The Remarkable Story of Caroline's Cart shares the story of a mom who simply needed to buy groceries but couldn't manipulate a shopping cart, and a wheelchair at the same time. Determined that there must be a better way, Long set out to create a new standard for one of the country's largest industries. Eventually, she succeeded, through a crazy, faith-challenging and remarkable journey that drew her into the worlds of engineering, manufacturing, finance, patent law and the corporate boardroom. The National Retail Federation recently honored Caroline's Cart as one of the top 25 companies shaping the future of retail in 2017. A key player in the success story of Caroline's Cart is Rebel Negley, who joined Long's company in 2012 as CEO and helped negotiate an international licensing and manufacturing agreement to make Caroline's Cart available on five continents. Negley and Long are available for speaking engagements, in which they share the story of the product that has been life-changing for families that have children and adults with special needs, as well as motivate listeners to become difference-makers in challenges they face in their everyday lives. About Caroline's Cart Caroline's Cart is a shopping cart created for children and adults with special needs. It provides parents and caregivers a viable option to transport a child through a store while grocery shopping, without simultaneously having to maneuver a wheelchair and a traditional grocery cart.

If you make a purchase by clicking one of our links, we may earn a small share of the revenue. Our picks and opinions are independent from any business incentives. Security cameras aren't a new idea. For years, they’ve been watching you and recording your every move at shops, movie theaters, and public parks. But home security cameras have come a long way in the past few years, including those designed to be installed outdoors. Like many other electronic devices, today’s outdoor security cameras are smarter than their ancestors. Tied to the cloud, they can send alerts to your phone the moment someone approaches your door, or tip you off when they spot suspicious activity in your yard. Many also function as two-way communicators, letting you talk to visitors, tell solicitors to buzz off, or scare away other, even more unwanted “guests.” But not all security cameras are smart enough to keep you and your family safe from harm. To make sure you’re covered like you should be, we installed five of the most popular cloud-connected models to see what they could see.  (Photo: Reviewed.com / Ben Keough) Best Overall: Nest Cam Outdoor As long as you don’t mind it being tethered to a power outlet, the Nest Cam Outdoor is the best smart outdoor security camera you can buy. That said, it's definitely a case of getting what you pay for, because the Nest Cam Outdoor is also one of the most expensive options we tested. While the upfront price is comparable to rivals, a subscription to the awesome Nest Aware cloud storage service will cost you anywhere from $100 to $300 per year. Nest Aware totally makes this camera. It adds tons of super useful features, including notifications that differentiate between people and pets; customizable activity zones that prevent areas with frequent, benign motion from triggering alerts; and the ability to create clips that you can share with family, friends, or law enforcement. Coolest of all, it adds a video history feature that records to the cloud 24/7. With a fast enough connection, you can scrub through the remote footage like it’s on a local DVR. It’s absolutely magical. Nest’s app is also the most user-friendly and functional of all those we tested. Streaming starts up quickly, navigation is fluid and natural, and the settings menu is broken up into sections that actually make sense. The video itself is the highest quality you can get from a smart security camera, with 1080p recording and excellent night vision. Where to Buy: $175.76 at Amazon $199.00 at Home Depot $181.99 at Best Buy $199.00 at Walmart  (Photo: Reviewed.com / Ben Keough) Best Value: Netgear Arlo Pro Most of the smart outdoor security cameras we tested cost around $200 for a single unit, but the Netgear Arlo Pro costs a little more—about $250. So how can it possibly be the best value? Because unlike the other options, it includes all of its software and cloud backup features for free. Yep, where Nest charges $100-300 per year for its Nest Aware subscription service, the Arlo Pro includes a rolling seven-days worth of cloud storage at no additional cost. Sure, you can pay for a subscription, but all that does is extend video backups to 30 or 60 days. It doesn’t unlock any otherwise hidden features. In other words, if all you need is seven days of video history, an Arlo Pro will only cost you $250, all-in. And if you'd like to expand your security camera setup, add-on Arlo cams are just $170 each. The Arlo Pro's video quality is just a touch behind Nest's in broad daylight, and lags a bit further behind in night vision. However, it has an exceptionally reliable connection thanks to the included base station, which plugs directly into your router. The base station also includes an incredibly loud siren, in case you need to scare off an intruder. Other pluses include a phenomenally long-lived battery and a freely adjustable magnetic mount. The Arlo app is perfectly functional, but its method of storing events in a calendar format is less intuitive than Nest Aware’s 24/7 scrollable timeline. Where to Buy: $227.50 at Amazon $249.99 at Home Depot $229.99 at Best Buy $227.50 at Walmart Kuna Toucan Surveillance Kit If you want your security cam to function as a doorbell, the Toucan Outdoor Security Camera is our top pick. Designed to be positioned just below a porch light, it uses 3M adhesive to stick to the wall of your house and is cleverly powered by a USB cable that plugs into a hub, which itself screws into the light socket. Trust us, it may sound complicated, but it’s really painless and intuitive to set up. Once it’s up and running, the Toucan works much like the other cameras we tested. It offers 720p HD live streaming, two-way audio, and a 100dBa siren. When something more subtle is called for, you can choose from an array of stock phrases (like “Sorry, not interested!”) that play through the camera's built-in speaker. Since the camera is powered via the light socket, you can also use the app to manually turn the light on and off, set a schedule to automatically toggle it, or set it to turn on when it detects motion. Unfortunately, the light bulb above the camera tends to attract flying insects, which can trigger false movement notifications at even the lowest sensitivity settings. And while Toucan’s $4.99 per month subscription plan is among the cheapest we’ve seen, it’s also only good for seven days of recording. If you want 14 or 30 days, it’s going to cost you as much as the vastly superior Nest Aware service. Image quality is fine in daylight, but you can’t really see anything at night, and WiFi performance is only so-so. Where to Buy: $149.02 at Amazon $179.99 at Home Depot Ring Stick Up Cam Ring’s Stick Up Cam has a charmingly scrappy feel to it—the box even includes a letter from the inventor thanking his wife for her support. Still, it lacks the polish of our top picks. The most annoying issue is that while the camera both tilts and pivots, there’s no resistance to the tilting mechanism. Since it’s top-heavy, that means it just tilts forward all the time, so you need to install it way up high on a wall in order to actually see anything other than your visitors’ shoes. While functional, the Ring app has fewer features than rivals, and video quality is mediocre in both daylight and at night. The battery-powered camera has a nifty solar panel accessory you can buy at an additional cost, but without it, battery life is average at best. Based on our calculations, you're unlikely to ever hit the advertised 6 to 12 months. And finally, WiFi reception seems weaker than on other models we tested; in our experience, the Stick-Up Cam frequently failed to begin live video streaming. Your experience may vary, depending on your WiFi setup. Where to Buy: $179.00 at Amazon $198.49 at Home Depot $179.99 at Best Buy $199.00 at Walmart Avoid: Canary Flex On the surface, the Canary Flex has a lot going for it. For instance, both the camera and the Canary app are slickly designed. The former has a stylish, soft-touch black finish and has the friendly, rounded pill shape of a lot of Bluetooth speakers, while the app shares a lot of Apple’s design language. Unfortunately, as a security camera, it has significant shortcomings. For one thing, the battery is supposed to last up to two months, but in our experience it's highly variable, perhaps due to weak WiFi signal strength. In comparison, the Arlo Pro can go for up to six months on a charge and exhibited no issues during our testing. Worse, several of the Canary Flex's best features simply don’t work. Not yet, anyway. Case in point: there’s a speaker on the camera, but it's not enabled, so you don’t get two-way audio. Canary says it will be activated "in the coming months," but for now it's a no-go. Video quality isn't a strong point, either; it's fine in daylight, but truly atrocious at night.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 25 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Leading Energy Storage and Ice Rink Provider CALMAC Celebrates its 70th Anniversary Over 1GW of IceBank energy storage and 1000 IceMat ice rinks have been installed in 60 countries FAIR LAWN, NJ–(Marketwired – Apr 25, 2017) – CALMAC®, a leader in cool energy technologies, today celebrates its 70th anniversary. Founded in 1947, Calvin ‚Cal’ MacCracken started the company to pursue his love of inventing. Prior to founding CALMAC, Cal designed and throttled the first jet engine ever built by GE. During his 50 years with CALMAC, he created over 250 inventions and had 80 patents. Some of his most widely known to the public include a hot dog cooker called Roll-A-Grill and the award-winning Alumazorb low emissivity ceiling, which has saved hundreds of millions of kWhs for ice rinks around the world. In addition to being a prolific inventor, Cal was an industry icon who was honored by ASHRAE and inducted into the ASHRAE Hall of Fame for his pioneering work in energy conservation through energy storage and ice rinks. Cal was so far head of his time, that on a „futuristic” 1953 T.V. show entitled 2000 A.D., Cal correctly predicted, in detail, the coming of the Solar Age. CALMAC was the originator of the IceMat® Ice Rink Floor, which creates perfectly uniform ice with dramatic reduction in pumping power. IceMat rolls out like a carpet and connects to a refrigeration unit for quick installation at both temporary and permanent ice rinks. This flexible design has since become the industry standard for ice rinks.  CALMAC’s most widely applied product is IceBank® energy storage which functions like an affordable, simple and reliable battery for a building’s air-conditioning system. IceBank® saves dramatically on the cost to cool buildings by reducing a building’s on-peak use of electricity. The IceBank ice battery system uses standard cooling equipment plus an energy storage tank to shift all or a portion of a building’s cooling needs to off-peak, nighttime hours. During off-peak hours, ice is made and stored inside IceBank energy storage tanks. The stored ice is then used to cool the building the next day. IceBank® offers a critical service to grid, since air-conditioning is the main culprit behind spikes in peak electrical demand. This on-peak reduction decreases the need to build new power plants or turn on expensive „peaker” power plants. The award-winning product has received many accolades including the Buildings Money-Saving Products Award and Building Operating Management Top Products Award. Used by over 4,000 businesses in 60 countries, CALMAC has over 1GW of energy storage worldwide and has built a prestigious list of customers including Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs, Google, Kohl’s, IBM, IKEA, McDonald’s, Morgan Stanley, Nordstrom, Rockefeller Center, Wal-Mart and more. The company’s customers range from school districts, universities and places of worship to government buildings, retailers and medical centers. One customer for example, St. Lucie County School District, has reduced utility costs by $5 million a year thanks to CALMAC. „As a school district located in South Florida, consistently hot temperatures and high humidity rates makes cooling 6.5M square feet of buildings and 40,000 students one of our biggest priorities and biggest expenses,” said Marty Sander, Executive Director of Growth Management, Land Acquisition, Inter-Governmental Relations, Facilities & Maintenance at St. Lucie County School District. „We pair high efficiency chillers with CALMAC’s energy storage technology for hybrid cooling system that shaves peak demand and reduces our utility bill. Before working with CALMAC, we ranked 60th out of 67 school districts statewide for energy use per student. Now, we have moved to 16 in the state and have reduced our energy costs from $12M to $7M per year. Not only are we saving money, but now we can budget for an extra 100 teachers.” As changes in business and the energy landscape occur, CALMAC’s ice based energy products continue to meet the challenges of today’s energy and facility managers. IceMat ice rinks are growing as a major player in retrofit markets with flexible, affordable engineered solutions for indoor and outdoor rinks. IceBank energy storage remains a leading thermal storage solution. Although storing energy in ice has been applied for over 40 years, there have been a number of internal and external factors that have led to a renewed interest in ice storage in the past decade. Materials of construction and manufacturing practices have increased the durability and life of the IceBank product, while growth of renewable energy and the green building market has turned the spotlight on the energy storage marketplace.  „In the mid-1970s, I joined the company because of its focus on solar energy,” said Mark MacCracken, son of Cal MacCracken and now CEO of CALMAC. „CALMAC’s development of IceBank became the top priority in the 1980’s. In the 1990’s, Demand Side Management was critical to the electric utilities and ice storage became a common tool to lower customer costs and decrease peak demand. As popularity for renewable energy rose following the development of LEED in the 2000s, the need for demand flexibility of energy storage became even more paramount. I went to Phoenix in 2009 to attend the GreenBuild Expo and was elected to be Chairman of the Board of Directors of US Green Building Council — ironically in the same city where my father attended the first Solar Energy Convention in 1955. It was an honor to be elected to run the most impactful non-profit organization in the sustainable marketplace in the same location my father launched CALMAC into it 54 years prior. He was truly ahead of his time.” In April 2017, Mark MacCracken was also recognized by City and State New York as an honoree of the Corporate Social Responsibility Award for Sustainability and Environmental Impact for his success in promoting sustainability initiatives in the energy sector as well as devoting his time to creating a positive environmental impact. For more information on CALMAC, visit www.calmac.com. About CALMAC Since 1947, CALMAC Corp has been a leading U.S. manufacturer of cool energy related technologies.

Founded in 1947, Calvin 'Cal' MacCracken started the company to pursue his love of inventing. Prior to founding CALMAC, Cal designed and throttled the first jet engine ever built by GE. During his 50 years with CALMAC, he created over 250 inventions and had 80 patents. Some of his most widely known to the public include a hot dog cooker called Roll-A-Grill and the award-winning Alumazorb low emissivity ceiling, which has saved hundreds of millions of kWhs for ice rinks around the world. In addition to being a prolific inventor, Cal was an industry icon who was honored by ASHRAE and inducted into the ASHRAE Hall of Fame for his pioneering work in energy conservation through energy storage and ice rinks. Cal was so far head of his time, that on a "futuristic" 1953 T.V. show entitled 2000 A.D., Cal correctly predicted, in detail, the coming of the Solar Age. CALMAC was the originator of the IceMat® Ice Rink Floor, which creates perfectly uniform ice with dramatic reduction in pumping power. IceMat rolls out like a carpet and connects to a refrigeration unit for quick installation at both temporary and permanent ice rinks. This flexible design has since become the industry standard for ice rinks.  CALMAC's most widely applied product is IceBank® energy storage which functions like an affordable, simple and reliable battery for a building's air-conditioning system. IceBank® saves dramatically on the cost to cool buildings by reducing a building's on-peak use of electricity. The IceBank ice battery system uses standard cooling equipment plus an energy storage tank to shift all or a portion of a building's cooling needs to off-peak, nighttime hours. During off-peak hours, ice is made and stored inside IceBank energy storage tanks. The stored ice is then used to cool the building the next day. IceBank® offers a critical service to grid, since air-conditioning is the main culprit behind spikes in peak electrical demand. This on-peak reduction decreases the need to build new power plants or turn on expensive "peaker" power plants. The award-winning product has received many accolades including the Buildings Money-Saving Products Award and Building Operating Management Top Products Award. Used by over 4,000 businesses in 60 countries, CALMAC has over 1GW of energy storage worldwide and has built a prestigious list of customers including Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs, Google, Kohl's, IBM, IKEA, McDonald's, Morgan Stanley, Nordstrom, Rockefeller Center, Wal-Mart and more. The company's customers range from school districts, universities and places of worship to government buildings, retailers and medical centers. One customer for example, St. Lucie County School District, has reduced utility costs by $5 million a year thanks to CALMAC. "As a school district located in South Florida, consistently hot temperatures and high humidity rates makes cooling 6.5M square feet of buildings and 40,000 students one of our biggest priorities and biggest expenses," said Marty Sander, Executive Director of Growth Management, Land Acquisition, Inter-Governmental Relations, Facilities & Maintenance at St. Lucie County School District. "We pair high efficiency chillers with CALMAC's energy storage technology for hybrid cooling system that shaves peak demand and reduces our utility bill. Before working with CALMAC, we ranked 60th out of 67 school districts statewide for energy use per student. Now, we have moved to 16 in the state and have reduced our energy costs from $12M to $7M per year. Not only are we saving money, but now we can budget for an extra 100 teachers." As changes in business and the energy landscape occur, CALMAC's ice based energy products continue to meet the challenges of today's energy and facility managers. IceMat ice rinks are growing as a major player in retrofit markets with flexible, affordable engineered solutions for indoor and outdoor rinks. IceBank energy storage remains a leading thermal storage solution. Although storing energy in ice has been applied for over 40 years, there have been a number of internal and external factors that have led to a renewed interest in ice storage in the past decade. Materials of construction and manufacturing practices have increased the durability and life of the IceBank product, while growth of renewable energy and the green building market has turned the spotlight on the energy storage marketplace.  "In the mid-1970s, I joined the company because of its focus on solar energy," said Mark MacCracken, son of Cal MacCracken and now CEO of CALMAC. "CALMAC's development of IceBank became the top priority in the 1980's. In the 1990's, Demand Side Management was critical to the electric utilities and ice storage became a common tool to lower customer costs and decrease peak demand. As popularity for renewable energy rose following the development of LEED in the 2000s, the need for demand flexibility of energy storage became even more paramount. I went to Phoenix in 2009 to attend the GreenBuild Expo and was elected to be Chairman of the Board of Directors of US Green Building Council -- ironically in the same city where my father attended the first Solar Energy Convention in 1955. It was an honor to be elected to run the most impactful non-profit organization in the sustainable marketplace in the same location my father launched CALMAC into it 54 years prior. He was truly ahead of his time." In April 2017, Mark MacCracken was also recognized by City and State New York as an honoree of the Corporate Social Responsibility Award for Sustainability and Environmental Impact for his success in promoting sustainability initiatives in the energy sector as well as devoting his time to creating a positive environmental impact.

Now, we have moved to 16 in the state and have reduced our energy costs from $12M to $7M per year. Not only are we saving money, but now we can budget for an extra 100 teachers." As changes in business and the energy landscape occur, CALMAC's ice based energy products continue to meet the challenges of today's energy and facility managers. IceMat ice rinks are growing as a major player in retrofit markets with flexible, affordable engineered solutions for indoor and outdoor rinks. IceBank energy storage remains a leading thermal storage solution. Although storing energy in ice has been applied for over 40 years, there have been a number of internal and external factors that have led to a renewed interest in ice storage in the past decade. Materials of construction and manufacturing practices have increased the durability and life of the IceBank product, while growth of renewable energy and the green building market has turned the spotlight on the energy storage marketplace.  "In the mid-1970s, I joined the company because of its focus on solar energy," said Mark MacCracken, son of Cal MacCracken and now CEO of CALMAC. "CALMAC's development of IceBank became the top priority in the 1980's. In the 1990's, Demand Side Management was critical to the electric utilities and ice storage became a common tool to lower customer costs and decrease peak demand. As popularity for renewable energy rose following the development of LEED in the 2000s, the need for demand flexibility of energy storage became even more paramount. I went to Phoenix in 2009 to attend the GreenBuild Expo and was elected to be Chairman of the Board of Directors of US Green Building Council -- ironically in the same city where my father attended the first Solar Energy Convention in 1955. It was an honor to be elected to run the most impactful non-profit organization in the sustainable marketplace in the same location my father launched CALMAC into it 54 years prior. He was truly ahead of his time." In April 2017, Mark MacCracken was also recognized by City and State New York as an honoree of the Corporate Social Responsibility Award for Sustainability and Environmental Impact for his success in promoting sustainability initiatives in the energy sector as well as devoting his time to creating a positive environmental impact. For more information on CALMAC, visit www.calmac.com. About CALMAC Since 1947, CALMAC Corp has been a leading U.S. manufacturer of cool energy related technologies. CALMAC is most known for its IceBank energy storage systems which strengthens the smart grid by storing critical energy sources -- including renewables like wind power -- for later use. IceBank energy storage tanks are installed at over 4,000 locations in 60 countries and last over 40 years. CALMAC's IceMat and Alumazorb products are found in hundreds of rinks worldwide. Customers trust CALMAC for the best ice skating surfaces under any conditions -- and lower construction and operating costs. Widely recognized for promoting peak energy conservation and energy cost savings, CALMAC Corp is a member of the Ice Skating Institute, U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) and the New Buildings Institute.

Nearly half of Fortune 500 companies – 48 percent – have at least one climate or clean energy target, up five percent from an earlier 2014 report. Accompanying this growth is rising ambition, with significant numbers of companies setting 100 percent renewable energy goals and science-based GHG reduction targets that align with the global goal of limiting global temperature rise to below two degrees Celsius. Findings from the new report, “Power Forward 3.0: How the largest U.S. companies are capturing business value while addressing climate change,” are based on 2016 company disclosures to CDP, which holds the world’s largest collection of self-reported corporate environmental data, and other public sources. “American businesses are leading the transition to a clean economy because it’s smart business and it’s what their customers want,” said Marty Spitzer, World Wildlife Fund’s senior director of climate and renewable energy. “Clean energy is fueling economic opportunity from coast to coast without regard for party line. Washington policies may slow this boom, but these companies are making it very clear that a transition to a low-carbon economy is inevitable.” The report highlights the financial benefits companies receive from their clean energy investments: Nearly 80,000 emission-reducing projects by 190 Fortune 500 companies reporting data showed nearly $3.7 billion in savings in 2016 alone. The emission reductions from these efforts are equivalent to taking 45 coal-fired power plants offline every year. Praxair, IBM and Microsoft are among the companies saving tens of millions of dollars annually through their energy efficiency efforts. The 240 companies with targets have set one or more of the following goals: GHG reductions, energy efficiency improvements, or renewable energy sourcing. Two hundred and eleven companies have set a GHG reduction goal, making it the most common target. “We are encouraged to see significant improvement in both the number of Fortune 500 companies setting climate and clean energy goals and the ambition of those goals – in particular commitments to setting science-based and 100 percent renewable energy targets,” said Anne Kelly, senior director of policy and the BICEP network at Ceres. “But in order to meet our national and global emissions goals, more companies will need to join the champions highlighted in this report, both in setting goals and in becoming vocal advocates for continued federal and state policies in support of climate and clean energy progress.” Ten percent (53) of companies have set renewable energy targets, and almost half of those (23) have committed to power 100 percent of their operations with renewable energy – among those, Wal-Mart, General Motors, Bank of America, Google, Apple and Facebook. The growth in the number and ambition of renewable energy commitments is mainly the result of recent sharp declines in renewable energy costs, which saves companies money, and of price certainty that comes with renewable energy. “Corporate commitment to energy efficiency and renewable energy is an accelerating trend that illustrates broader recognition within the business community of the importance of clean energy and the financial benefits it can yield,” said Stu Dalheim, vice president of corporate shareholder engagement for Calvert. “Many of the largest companies in the U.S. are achieving significant cost savings through clean energy programs and mitigating longer-term risks associated with energy price volatility.” Some of the strongest efforts are also among Fortune 100 companies, with nearly two-thirds (63 percent) adopting or retaining goals. The report also shows strong improvement among the smallest 100 companies in the Fortune 500, with 44 percent setting goals in one or more categories, up 19 percentage points from the 2014 report. The report shows a significant spread in target setting among different sectors, with Consumer Staples (72%), Materials (66%), and Utilities (65%) sectors leading in setting clean energy goals and the Energy sector (11%), including oil & gas companies, significantly lagging.   “CDP and the investors we work with, representing over US$100 trillion in assets, engage thousands of the world’s largest companies to measure and manage climate-related risks” said Lance Pierce, president of CDP North America. “Voluntary corporate disclosure highlights the compelling business case for corporate clean energy procurement and clearly demonstrates the transition underway in the energy markets. Companies in turn have benefited, identifying billions of dollars in savings and new opportunities through their disclosures to CDP.” The report includes key recommendations for companies, policymakers and investors to continue to scale clean energy efforts, such as: Companies should continue to set, implement and communicate clean energy targets, while supporting local, state and national policies that make it easier to achieve their climate and energy commitments. Federal and state policymakers should establish clear, long-term low-carbon polices that will help companies meet their clean energy targets while also helping the U.S. meet its carbon-reducing commitments under the Paris Climate Agreement. Investors should consider allocating their investments to companies well-positioned for the low-carbon economy. Investors should continue to file shareholder resolutions and engage in dialogues with companies to encourage them to set climate and energy efficiency targets and position themselves for a low-carbon future.

McIntyre April 25, 2017 6:50 am EDT Print Email Tweet The two companies that dominate internet use took the first and second place in audience size in a new study of digital media. Of the two, Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google holds a substantial lead over Facebook Inc. (NASDAQ: FB) in terms of monthly unique visitors in March. comScore has issued its monthly report, “Top 50 Multi-Platform Properties.” It includes mobile and PC users, as well as use both at home and at work. Google’s monthly unique visitors in March totaled 242 million. The number for Facebook was 203 million. Ironically, Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ: YHOO) sites were in third place with 197 million unique visitors. The company was recently sold to Verizon for $4.48 billion. Facebook, although only slightly larger in U.S. audience, has a market value of $421 billion. Of course, each company has large overseas visitor counts. Facebook has nearly 1.9 billion members. And marketing on Facebook is considered a major part of the future of online advertising. Yahoo’s reliance on display advertising is considered primarily the past. Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT) sites, which include MSN, finished fourth based on monthly unique visitors in March with 184 million, followed by Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) at 183 million to round out the top five. Amazon’s nearly complete dominance of e-commerce is reflected in the figure. The next largest retailer based on unique visitors is Wal-Mart, in 24th place with 87 million. The Wal-Mart number does show that among retailers of any kind, it is the only one that has a chance to challenge Amazon. Among social media sites, Microsoft’s LinkedIn had 110 million unique visitors in March. Twitter had 97 million, followed by Snapchat at 91 million and Pinterest at 88 million. Among media companies, Comcast’s NBC Universal was the leader with 166 million unique visitors in March. The company owns many media properties, including NBC Sports, Universal Studios, Bravo and MSNBC. CBS Interactive was slightly behind at 162 million, followed by Time Warner’s Turner Digital, which includes CNN and Time’s online sites. Google’s lead over all the largest sites is so large that it is unlikely to be topped anytime soon. I'm interested in the Newsletter Get Newsletter terms and conditions   By Douglas A.

Good News Nation World Debunked Entertainment Sports Tech Science Connect with us Morning News USA Good News Nation World Debunked Entertainment Sports Tech Science Teacher Raises Money To Buy 650 Students A Bike Of Their Own Share Tweet Bike Pixabay Good News Teacher Raises Money To Buy 650 Students A Bike Of Their Own By Jennifer Ong Published on April 5, 2017 Share Tweet Comment A teacher has taken it upon herself to make sure that every student in her school has a bike to call their own. Katie Blomquist is a first-grade teacher who strongly believes that every child should have the opportunity to enjoy his or her childhood. And what’s a better way for a child to spend a sunny afternoon than to ride a bike around the neighborhood? One little boy inspired his teacher to get a bike for everyone. Blomquist said that the idea to get bikes was inspired by one of her students. “Due to his circumstances, he wasn’t getting the opportunity to enjoy many life experiences, and he never had been given a reason to be motivated in school,” she explained. That’s when Blomquist decided to do something about it. She started taking her student out to museums, restaurants, plays, music stores and the beach. For his birthday, Blomquist decided to take him to Walmart so he could choose gifts. The boy asked her for a bike, but Blomquist said she couldn’t afford it. That’s when the teacher decided to set up a GoFundMe page to get some help. While setting up the page, Blomquist realized that a lot of students in her class are experiencing the same financial situation as the little boy. Students in her school are generally from low-income families, and a bike just isn’t something they can afford to spend on. This is what inspired her to secure bikes for all 650 students in the school instead. According to a report from ABC News, Blomquist managed to raise $80,000 in less than three months. She also received a generous donation from Steve Harvey. In fact, the host presented Blomquist a check for $20,000 when she appeared on “The Steve Harvey Show.” With the money, Blomquist approached local bike shop Affordabike. Together, Blomquist and the store spent seven months designing the perfect bikes for the kids. They also picked out the colors and named the bikes, “The future, let’s go places.” Today, Blomquist has a bigger goal. She recently created the organization Going Places, dedicated to providing children of low-income families with various enjoyable activities. These include summer camp, swimming lessons and more. Blomquist’s new organization provides bikes, too! To help Going Places, you can make a donation here. ALSO READ: Boy With Autism Sells Drawings To Buy Toys For Sick Brother Liked this story?

But is that a good thing? A new bill proposed in the U.S. House of Representatives could eliminate one of the favorite tactics of shareholders who want companies to change how they conduct business. Supporters of the Financial Choice Act 2.0, including Jeb Hensarling, Chair of the House Financial Services Committee, claim that this legislation will hold Wall Street accountable by empowering ordinary Americans instead of Washington, D.C. bureaucrats. But critics of this legislation, which promises to overhaul the Dodd-Frank Act, say that if this bill becomes law, it will do more than end the “too big to fail era” and end the banking bailouts, which in part fueled the rise of the Tea Party earlier this decade. They argue that the legislation throws the baby out with the bathwater, as it would phase out the mechanism by which activist shareholders have been able to nudge companies to become more environmentally and socially responsible. Current U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules require investors to own either 1 percent or $2,000 worth of a publicly-traded companies stock for a continuous year in order to allow them to file shareholder resolutions to be voted on at a company’s annual shareholders meeting. The rule has allowed non-profits such as PETA, the Humane Society and Philadelphia-based Sisters of St. Francis to attempt to influence corporate policies by forcing shareholders to vote on a wide variety of issues on annual proxy statements. While these shareholder proposals were generally non-binding, and have overall been voted down by an overwhelming margin over the years, the public relations fallout has often convinced companies to enact such changes eventually. The Humane Society, for example, has taken credit for companies such as Tysons and Smithfield to push their suppliers to improve their animal welfare standards due to their wielding of shareholder proposals. But this proposed legislation would end the $2,000 minimum threshold and keep the one percent mandate intact, and prohibit the filing of shareholder proposals on the behalf of other investors. Walmart’s market cap currently is over $227 billion; one only has to imagine the hurdles imposed on shareholders who want to pursue change at a company of even one-tenth of Walmart’s size. The effect would serve to muzzle the vast majority of shareholders, who in the past have pushed for reforms related to executive compensation, lobbying activities, climate change and campaign finance. Earlier this year, investors urged the Trump Administration to keep rule 14a-8, the SEC directive that allows such proposals to come to a vote at annual shareholder meetings. While the sheer number of these resolutions have increased in recent years, as a percentage, this is still a rare tactic; the 172 resolutions that made ballots during last year’s proxy season affected less than 5 percent of the publicly traded firms selling shares within the U.S. Market. As the New York Times pointed out yesterday, this legislation would create sweeping changes that go beyond proxy ballots. Instead of allowing the SEC to continue file administrative cases before its own internal judges, those cases would be tried in front of a federal district court, which in recent years have ruled more favorably to companies. In addition, the SEC would no longer be able to bar someone guilty of violating federal securities laws from serving as an executive or director of a publicly owned company. And while the SEC could still impose multi-million dollar fines for securities violations, the agency would also have to determine whether such penalties would harm shareholders, which in the end would discourage such punishment in the first place. “Change is certainly in the air for the S.E.C,” wrote Peter J. Henning in the Times. “The question is whether it will be hamstrung by the Financial Choice Act 2.0 if it is adopted in its current form, and how effective it will be in policing corporate America.” Considering that the White House prefers a neutered SEC that will ditch enforcement for unfettered business expansion, watch for yet another reform from the previous decade to disappear in the coming months.

By Sarmistha Acharya Updated April 25, 2017 09:04 BST The pre-orders for Galaxy S8 and S8 were the best everGetty Images/Jung Yeon-Je Samsung has said that the pre-orders for the latest Galaxy S8 surpassed those for its predecessor by 30%. Last week, the company announced the availability of its new Galaxy flagship device in select markets such as the US, Canada, Puerto Rico and Korea. The rollout will expand to additional markets across the globe in the coming weeks. Major carrier networks in the UK such as EE, iD, O2, Three and Vodafone have already kicked off pre-orders throwing in several data deals. Those in the US can purchase the S8 and S8+ from AT&T, Cricket Wireless, Sprint, Straight Talk Wireless, T-Mobile, US Cellular and Verizon. It is also on sale on Best Buy retail stores as well as its online store and Samsung online store, Target and Walmart. "At Samsung, we believe it is a privilege to make groundbreaking products that are enjoyed by millions, and have recommitted ourselves to innovate, not only with new products and services, but also in process," Samsung Electronics America president and chief operating officer Tim Baxter told CNBC. "The Galaxy S8 and S8+ are a result of that recommitment and the market has responded – with a more than 30% year-over-year growth in pre-orders versus the record pre-orders we had with Galaxy S7, making it our best ever," added Baxter. Earlier this month, Samsung confirmed that the pre-orders for the S8 and S8+ exceeded those for the S7, without revealing the figures. It merely said: "Initial response to the pre-orders that have begun at various places across the world have been better than expected." Analysts too believe the handsets have been received better than expected since their launch. Meanwhile, Samsung will release a software update soon to address the red-tinted screen issue.

Jonathan said he discovered the magic of Jeff Bezos’ e-commerce giant almost a decade ago while he and his wife, both busy running their small business, were raising their three kids and were always running out of diapers. “I quickly realized how, being a family of five, we didn’t have time to go to the store,” he told The Post this week. The Rhudys’ buying habits mimic those of millions of Americans, and that surely makes Bezos very happy — not to mention immensely wealthy. Bezos, who has grown his humble, money-losing online book shop in 1995 into one of the most powerful economic engines on Earth — selling everything from airplane parts to zebra-print dresses — saw his net worth grow alongside his company. This week, he became the world’s second-richest person, worth $76 billion. Amazon, which is also in the movie-producing business — it won an Oscar for its “Manchester by the Sea” — is now the fourth-most-valuable company in the United States and employs 341,400 full- and part-time employees. Amazon will add another 100,000 full-time jobs over the next 18 months, Bezos proudly announced this year. The new jobs are great, but a closer inspection shows Amazon may simply be adding back jobs it helped kill off. Jeff BezosGetty Images For example, Amazon played a large role in eliminating more than 50,000 jobs in recent years from just three companies — Staples, Office Depot and Best Buy, public filings show. In March, MarketWatch estimated that Amazon will destroy 1.5 million retail jobs in the next five years. And with its push into self-driving trucks, drone delivery, automated grocery stores and more, the site said the total number of lost jobs would likely be more than 2 million, concluding, “Could Amazon actually kill more American jobs than China did? It’s quite likely.” In addition to capturing 50 cents of every dollar spent online, Amazon, according to a report by the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, a nonprofit research organization, is used for half the online shopping searches undertaken by US consumers. In other words, Bezos knows what you want to buy before you buy it. Critics are beginning to wonder if Amazon — with such control over retail sales, jobs, ad dollars and more — is good for America. One thing is for sure: Bezos isn’t ready to slow down — he wants Amazon to control even more of Americans’ lifestyles. A report several weeks ago from Bloomberg revealed that Amazon has invited executives from companies that make major consumer brands — like Nike, Oreos and Cheerios — to a meeting in May where the company hopes to convince them not to sell their products through Walmart and other big-box retailers. SEE ALSO Jeff Bezos could buy every NFL team and still be set for life 0:0 Amazon’s amazing 46 percent run-up in its stock price over... Bezos wants the brands to be sold direct to consumers through Amazon. The company also is spreading its wings deeper into media with its $50 million deal last week to stream 10 Thursday night NFL games next season. Bezos paid five times what Twitter paid for the streaming rights in 2016. There is also chatter that Amazon will soon add freighters to its retail arsenal, which already includes trucks, plans for drones and some planes. Not everyone is scared of Amazon’s growing influence and power. “Retail always evolves and reflects society, and right now, consumers are getting more value for their money,” said Richard Kestenbaum, a partner in Triangle Capital. “That makes our society stronger and it forces other retailers to be more creative and competitive.” But more and more are casting a wary eye on the Seattle company, whose brown boxes with the “smiling” arrows are ubiquitous. Critics say Amazon is crushing local jobs and tax bases. “People need to have jobs to be able to afford online delivery, and Amazon has knocked out so many private-sector retail jobs and will knock out public-sector jobs as well,” said Burt Flickinger, managing director of Strategic Resource Group, a retail consulting firm. For years, there has been talk about Amazon ruining better-paying retail jobs and replacing them with lower-paying ones. It has tried to fight back — but there is still a strong belief that jobs at Bezos’ company don’t pay well. “This is a company that is so sophisticated in its use of the web and supply chain, but it adopts this retrograde way of employing labor,” said Nelson Lichtenstein, director of the Center for the Study of Work, Labor and Democracy at the University of California Santa Barbara. Amazon played a large role in eliminating more than 50,000 jobs in recent years from just three companies — Staples, Office Depot and Best Buy, public filings show. “Here are these 500 to 800 workers toiling away in a big warehouse, but many aren’t employed directly by Amazon, and if they have a complaint, Amazon says, ‘It’s not our problem,’ because they are contract workers.” Most of the jobs Amazon creates are low-paying warehouse and customer-service positions. The warehouse jobs pay, on average, $12.32 an hour, 9 percent less than the industry average at other warehouses, according to ILSR, which looked at 1,300 Amazon wage postings on Glassdoor.com. Amazon says its employees receive a “comprehensive benefits package,” including healthcare, 401(k) and company stock awards, in addition to performance-based bonuses that add to the overall value of base pay. Recent Amazon ads for customer service reps who work from home show that the company is paying just $10 an hour— or just $2.75 more than the federal minimum wage. Although Amazon defends its salaries, touting that they’re 30 percent higher than what other retailers pay, critics say the comparison is not apples to apples. Bezos disagrees. “These jobs are not just in our Seattle headquarters or in Silicon Valley — they’re in our customer-service network, fulfillment centers and other facilities in local communities throughout the country,” he said in a statement. But research shows that Amazon’s job gains have come at the expense of other jobs and that the quality of the Amazon positions is inferior, with about 40 percent of the workforce in its warehouses considered contract or temporary employees, according to ILSR. Amazon counters, claiming that on average nearly 90 percent of its warehouse workers are regular, full-time employees, though the number of temporary workers rises during peak demand times. For years, one of Amazon’s biggest edges over competitors was that it didn’t collect state sales tax, giving it a price advantage equaling as much as 9 percent in states like New York. That income, experts say, deprived states of revenue and contributed to budget shortfalls. That changed on April 1. Amazon is now collecting state taxes in the 45 states that have them, according to the Tax Policy Center. “But the damage was done,” said Flickinger. “The money that was not collected can’t be made up, and those budget deficits are going to force state governments to lay off employees at unprecedented rates.” Bezos is hardly cowed by critics or allegations that Amazon is a job wrecker. Such taunts almost seem to embolden the brash entrepreneur, whose vision for the company includes convenience stores without cashiers, deliveries with drones and, irony of ironies, opening bookstores. Bezos has shown an unlimited ability to spend money to accomplish his goal of dominating different sectors. And now the grocery business may be in his cross hairs. He is developing an Amazon Go store, which will allow the company’s Prime customers to pull items off shelves and carry them home without passing through a cashier’s line or opening their wallets. Customers simply scan their phones on a kiosk when they enter the store, and Amazon technology charges their account after they leave the store. The stores require way fewer employees — and could drive rival grocers out of business. Bezos’ hiring announcements generate excitement in the media, most recently in January, when he revealed a plan to add 100,000 employees over the following 18 months. But left unsaid are all the jobs quietly killed off over the years — in bookstores, electronics chains, office-supply shops and soon, perhaps, supermarkets. And maybe, too, another block in another town left a little less active.

As Wolf alludes in this post, one of the reason so many real world retailers are hitting the wall so hard is that private equity leverage and asset stripping made them particularly vulnerable. While the losses to online retailers would have forced some downsizing regardless, the fact that so many are making desperate moves in parallel is in large measure due to the fact that the tender ministrations of their private equity overlords have made them fragile. Eileen Appelbaum and Rosemary Batt, in their landmark book Private Equity at Work, described a real estate looting strategy that as of 2014 had already ruined some formerly viable retail and restaurant chains. As we summarized their observations: For instance, one way that private equity overlords enrich themselves at the expense of the businesses they acquire is by taking real estate owned by the company, spinning it out into another entity (owned by the PE fund and to be monetized subsequently) and having the former owner make lease payments to its new landlord. The problem with this approach is usually twofold. First the businesses that chose to own their own real estate did so for good reason. They were typically seasonal businesses, like retailers, or low margin businesses particularly vulnerable to the business cycle, like low-end restaurants. Owning their own property reduced their fixed costs, making them better able to ride out bad times. To make this picture worse, the PE firms typically “sell” the real estate at an inflated price, which justifies saddling the operating business with high lease payments, making the financial risk to the company even higher. Of course, those potentially unsustainable rents make the real estate company look more valuable to prospective investors than it probably is. Eileen Applebaum provided examples of how this worked (and regularly left bankruptcies in its wake) in an interview with Andrew Dittmer. Now here is the cute part. First, remember that the private equity fund manager makes out regardless of whether their investors do well, since nearly 2/3 of their total fees are not related to performance. We’ve posted on how private equity fund managers get rich on management fees alone. However, private equity fund managers do have an incentive not to burn private equity limited partners, since they want to raise more funds. The real estate asset stripping op co/prop co model is analogous to the discredited dividend recap strategy, which was widely criticized after Clayton & Dubilier quickly bankrupted Hertz that way. But leveraging up a company in a very big way and extracting a lot of cash, which the op co/prop co model does, allows the private equity fund manager to make a big distribution to investors early on, producing a handsome IRR on that deal. And if the deal goes bad, what happens? The end result to the private equity investors depends on how much cash was returned, between the real estate sale and any positive cash flows afterward, before the company goes bust. It could turn out to be pretty profitable to a bit of a turkey. The real losers are the lenders to the retailer. And who might they be? Increasingly they are the very same investors as in the private equity funds. Private equity fund managers offer credit funds, which lend in large measure to private equity deals. However, the effect for an investor like CalPERS is to distort which pocket made the money. The private equity deal looks better by virtue of dumping losses on the credit fund, which are seldom recouped even in case of seemingly obvious fraudulent conveyance (those cases are costly and difficult to win and even then, recoveries are almost always partial). So from the perspective of reporting investment strategy returns, the private equity gains are coming at least in part from bankruptcy-induced diminished returns at credit funds held by the same investors. By Wolf Richter, a San Francisco based executive, entrepreneur, start up specialist, and author, with extensive international work experience. Originally published at Wolf Street Mall traffic is sagging. Department store sales have been in decline since 2001. Most retailers are loaded up with debt. Many have been losing money. Now they’re running out of options. Store closings numbered in the thousands last year. This year they promise to get much worse. “Zombie malls” have become reality, their vast parking lots rented to car dealers to store their excess vehicle inventory. But ecommerce sales are booming, including online sales by some brick-and-mortar retailers, such as Walmart and Macy’s:   Over-indebted retailers are notoriously difficult to restructure and many end up being liquidated. Unsecured creditors, such as suppliers and junior bond holders, are often left out in the cold. Even secured creditors can end up holding the bag. April so far is huge for brick-and-mortar meltdown: April 21 – Bebe Stores, a fashion retailer, announced, after four years of losses, that it would close all its 180 stores by the end of May and liquidate all merchandise and fixtures in the stores. It might also file for bankruptcy to get out of the store leases. It will only sell online. Barely a month earlier, Bebe said it had hired a financial adviser to look at “strategic alternatives” and a real estate adviser “to assist with options related to its lease holdings,” at which point its shares plunged. April 19 – Neiman Marcus, the luxury retailer with 42 stores around the country and two Bergdorf Goodman stores in Manhattan, announced that, in order to preserve cash, it would not pay interest on a bond issue in cash, but “in kind.” The payment-in-kind (PIK) option had been written into the bond covenant. At the time, creditors didn’t care. Now they’ll get the coupon on these $600 million in 8.75% notes for the next six months in form of more bonds of uncertain value. The already beaten-down notes traded at 56.7 cents on the dollar. On March 3, sources told Reuters that Neiman Marcus has hired investment bank Lazard Ltd to help restructuring its nearly $5 billion in debt though it was, these sources insisted, in no immediate risk of bankruptcy. The company was acquired by private equity firms in a leveraged buyout before the Financial Crisis and is now owned by Ares Management and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board. They were going to dump it into the public’s lap, but the IPO was scrapped when the problems could no longer be hidden. April 17 – Marsh Supermarkets was preparing to file for Bankruptcy, sources told the Wall Street Journal. Three weeks earlier, it stopped paying rent on six Indianapolis stores. Here too, there’s a private equity angle. Sun Capital Partners acquired Marsh in 2006 for $88 million in cash and the assumption of $237 million in debt. At the time it had 120 stores. Ten years of asset stripping later, the chain is down to 67 stores and going bankrupt. April 11 – Arhaus, a furniture retailer that designs its own furniture and contracts out manufacturing, with 67 stores in 25 states, has appointed a “chief restructuring officer, two sources close to the situation said,” according to Debtwire. “This complements the co-advisory roles of Piper Jaffray and Candlewood Partners to explore a refinancing.” In early March, Arhaus announced that CEO Adrian Mitchell, after just 13 months on the job, would be replaced by co-founder and Chairman John Reed. In 2014, private equity firm Freeman Spogli made a minority investment. April 4 – Rue21, a teen apparel chain with over 1,000 stores, missed principal and interest payments on its debt and is preparing to file for bankruptcy as soon as this month, said “people familiar with the matter,” according to Debtwire. Once again, there is a private equity angle: the company was acquired by PE firm Apax in 2013 for about $1 billion. Back in September 2013, problems were already piling up when JPMorgan, Bank of America, and Goldman Sachs had trouble selling the junk debt they pledged to sell to fund the buyout. April 4 – Payless Inc., the discount shoe retailer with almost 22,000 employees and over 4,000 stores in 30 countries, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. It plans to slash its debt in half. It said its restructuring plan has the support of creditors holding two-thirds of its first-lien and second-lien term debt. It said it would immediately shutter about 400 stores in the US and Puerto Rico. CEO W. Paul Jones blamed “the continued challenges of the retail environment, which will only intensify.” Here too, a PE angle: Payless was acquired by PE firms Golden Gate Capital and Blum Capital Partners in 2012 when publicly traded Collective Brands was broken up. And this is the March meltdown: On March 20, Sears, the big whale that everyone is waiting for to wash up on the beach, came closer to washing up on the beach by acknowledging that it will likely wash up on the beach, when it said in its annual report that it had “substantial doubt” about its ability to keep operating as a “going concern.” It lost over $10 billion in recent years. When will Sears finally file for bankruptcy? Not before the second half of 2017. That was our verdict in December, and we’re sticking to it. If it files before July 8, 2017, it might run afoul of the bankruptcy code’s two-year look-back period governing “fraudulent conveyance,” concerning what happened to Sears’ real estate. On March 11, Gordmans Stores, with over 100 locations in 22 states, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy with plans to liquidate its inventory and assets. By the end of March, Stage Stores jumped in and offered to buy at least 50 of the stores. Gordman’s is another PE firm asset-stripping special. It was acquired by PE firm Sun Capital in 2008 at the end of the leveraged buyout boom for an undisclosed price. In 2010, Sun Capital sold 30% of this shares in an IPO. Gordman’s got nothing. In 2012, Sun Capital sold more shares, slashing its ownership to 50%. In 2013, Sun Capital forced Gordman’s to issue a $70 million special dividend, of which Sun Capital got half. Of that dividend, $25 million came from cash holdings; $45 million was borrowed money. In total, Sun Capital obtained $140 million, likely exceeding the purchase price by good margin. And the party may not be over yet. On March 10, Gander Mountain, after a failed expansion drive, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. It will shutter 32 of its 160 stores. It had been taken private in 2010 by Gratco, a holding company controlled by Gander Chairman and CEO David Pratt, and Holiday Station stores, a gas-station retail operation. On March 8, RadioShack, owned since 2015 by General Wireless, filed for bankruptcy for the second time. It will close about 200 stores and evaluate options on the remaining 1,300. On March 6, hhgregg, an appliance and electronics retailer, filed for bankruptcy, after announcing a few days earlier that it would close 88 of its 220 stores, shutter three distribution centers, and shed 1,500 jobs. On March 1: BCBG Max Azria filed for bankruptcy. The fashion retailer that once had more than 570 boutiques globally, including 175 in the US, started closing 120 of its stores in January. The January and February meltdown: Michigan Sporting Goods Distributors said it will liquidate its 68 stores and lay off its 1,300 workers. Eastern Outfitters, the parent of Bob’s Stores and Eastern Mountain Sports, owned by PE firm Versa Capital, filed for bankruptcy. Wet Seal filed for the second time in recent years. The teen retailer closed all its stores. Limited stores, another victory for PE firm Sun Capital, shuttered all its 250 stores. American Apparel, a manufacturer with 110 retail stores, which had filed for bankruptcy for the second time last November, said that it had started to lay off 2,400 workers and that everything would be shut down. Only the brand name was acquired by a Canadian firm. This thermometer for discretionary spending is the first to react when consumers hit their limits.

Reply ↓ Art Eclectic April 25, 2017 at 11:49 am Exactly. The crappified shopping experience and lack of inventory came first. A miserable brick and mortar experience drove shoppers into the welcoming arms of Amazon because they just wanted to buy stuff and retail made it hard. Reply ↓ Vatch April 25, 2017 at 12:46 pm lack of inventory A couple of days ago, reader Heron pointed this out: http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2017/04/amazon-com-effect-retailers-say-theyre-not-selling-consumers-report-buying.html#comment-2804851 Whether it’s called “slim inventory” or “JIT”, it’s a problem for shoppers. Reply ↓ sgt_doom April 25, 2017 at 2:01 pm Indeed! I’m sure an old junk bond Wall Street dood like Bezos is already pals with ’em! Great article, and should be enlightening for those not in the know. Whether Josh Kosman’s outstanding book, The Buyout of America, or Eileen Appelbaum’s marvelous work, the PE swineherds have been dismantling the American (and other countries’) economy for quite a few years now, and the kings of debt, led by Peter G. Peterson who spends his free time decrying debt (?!?!?!?), are the villains of our age! Reply ↓ AnotherTosser April 25, 2017 at 6:18 pm The retail market, by and large, is hosed, especially if they’ve decided to get into bed with PE. Amazon might be filling out the areas left bare by the collapse, but Amazon itself has a major problem in the form of counterfeit inventory which is going to blow up in its face. If you look at the comments on HN, more than a few people mention how they got something that was sold (sometimes by Amazon) as legit, but turned out to be fake – this stems from Amazon’s practice of commingling inventory when you participate in their “fulfilled by” program. Considering their expansion into grocery and other food-type items, a counterfeit scandal is one they can ill afford. If retail’s currently fried, and you can’t trust what you buy on Amazon, what’s left? The correction is going to take a while, and will be deeply felt, I fear. Reply ↓ cnchal April 25, 2017 at 10:06 pm > If retail’s currently fried, and you can’t trust what you buy on Amazon, what’s left? Manufacturers cooperating or colluding to develop their own sales platform and cutting out Amazon and Wal Mart and selling direct to the customer. Reply ↓ Colonel Smithers April 25, 2017 at 5:26 am Thank you, Yves. You won’t be surprised to hear about this scam operating in the UK. It has been the case for about thirty years and forms part of the “financial engineering” that has replaced metal bashing in Blighty. It’s not just retail, but football (aka soccer) that has fallen victim. Many clubs were similarly divided between the operating company / team and the ground. Some still are, e.g. Chelsea and Stamford Bridge. Around the turn of the century, a former footballer (ex West Ham and Manchester City and one of the mobile chicanes negotiated by Diego Maradona for his second goal against England at the World Cup in 1986) who had made a small fortune at the Lloyd’s insurance market, approached my employer, HSBC, for a loan, if not a partnership, to take over Aston Villa, which operates from a big site in Birmingham (Villa Park). His plan was to split the football club from the ground / stadium and get the club to pay the landlord rent, develop the ground for residential and retail purposes, and get the club to share a stadium with another Birmingham / Midlands region club, e.g. Birmingham City, Wolverhampton Wanderers (Wolves) or Port Vale. HSBC wisely declined. It was still just about a boring trade bank then, but was embarking on a spree under John Bond. Not long after, Barclays (a future employer at the time) became adviser to Leeds United. I don’t know if Leeds split between club and ground (Elland Road), but the club began leasing, not buying players, and securitising the income stream. After some success, including an appearance in Europe’s top competition, Leeds fell apart and is languishing in the lower divisions (minor leagues). Philip Augar, a former banker (Schroeders, NatWest etc.) and author (Reckless Capitalism, Decline Of Gentlemanly Capitalism etc.), dedicated one of his books to Leeds United, his childhood club, “one of the early victims of this madness”. The footballer I mentioned above is still active in the City, not so much at Lloyd’s (opposite one of my two offices), but with financial engineering in sport. He was widely quoted in the FT a few weeks ago. With regard to retail, the scam played a part in the collapse of a retail chain, British Home Stores. The former chairman and main shareholder, “Sir” Philip Green, split the retail operations from the stores. He / his Monaco company owns many of the (former) sites, including what was BHS HQ in Marylebone (just down the road from Baker Street station and Mme Tussaud). Reply ↓ Colonel Smithers April 25, 2017 at 5:33 am I forgot to add that said player was still hawking the same “financial solutions” (snake oil) in the FT. The paper did not mention how the solutions had worked out. The thing is, in many cases, the solutions seem / are designed to fail, after some roaring success, and (or so) the insiders can profit from the wreckage (“disaster capitalism”) as they are often creditors (e.g. the knight of the realm above) and can salvage what they consider to be the valuable bits. Reply ↓ Colonel Smithers April 25, 2017 at 5:40 am Just one more thing to add, sorry, is that many UK retailers are under similar pressure. One hears in the City that one or two household names are nearing collapse. One well known US Main Street store merged with a well known and similar UK High Street store a couple or so years ago. They are run / owned from Switzerland, I think, by an Italian, whose PE firm, again based off shore, is one of the biggest shareholders in the group. The Italian billionaire ran the UK firm before the merger. They are rumoured to be one, if not the, next domino. Reply ↓ allan April 25, 2017 at 6:58 am Yet another unintended (?) consequence of QE ∞. The ZIRP simultaneously made pension funds and endowments desperate for returns and enabled PE firms to raise large amounts of money at low rates. But on the bright side, QE saved us over the last 8 years from the horror of meaningful fiscal stimulus and infrastructure investment. So we should thank Drs. Bernanke and Yellen and their enablers for letting the market work its magic and protecting us from the dead hand of state intervention. Reply ↓ Jim A. April 25, 2017 at 8:06 am And the great recession meant that there were plenty of stressed business which PE funds could gain controlling interests in for relatively low cost. Reply ↓ Grumpy Engineer April 25, 2017 at 9:58 am ZIRP also made it easier to load all of these retailers up with excess debt. Management could borrow more money than necessary, pay themselves lavish bonuses with the excess, and claim that “interest rates are low; making payments will be easy“. They could even show you the math. Of course, that math assumed that sales would steadily climb into the future. If sales fell even slightly, the payments became an oversized burden. And paying off the enormous loan principal was beyond all hope. Companies with little debt can generally survive a reduction in sales. They can engage in cost-cutting exercises, maybe encourage some employees to retire earlier, etc. It’s even easier if they own their own property and don’t have to renegotiate a lease. But when you’ve got a lot of debt and servicing that debt requires that sales continue to rise quarter after quarter after quarter without fail, then things get a LOT more fragile. The effects of even a single bad quarter get greatly amplified. [“Leverage” can work both ways.] And steadily-declining sales are the kiss of death. Oh, yes. Ultra-low interest rates “helped” retailers a lot. Helped set them up for failure, that is.

Reply ↓ McWatt April 25, 2017 at 10:36 am Interestingly, it seems to me, that the off shoring of clothing manufacturing to China, and the subsequent fall in inventory cost to retailers and the incredible margins they operate on hasn’t done anyone any good in the end. Reply ↓ FedUpPleb April 25, 2017 at 10:47 am I have found retail shopping over the last ten years to be a poor now bordering on depressing experience. Poor selection, sparse stores, uncompetitive prices,staff either untrained or trained only to nag about loyalty cards, and the quality of items has nosedived across the board. Even the “luxury” items are cheap and poorly made. The only consistent exvception to this trend is toy stores. I guess kids are tougher customers. I hate shopping online. I hate the uncertainty. I hate the delay. I hate the decision fatigue. But what choice do I even have anymore? It costs me more petrol to go shopping than they charge for delivery. Reply ↓ sgt_doom April 25, 2017 at 2:05 pm Thanks, FedUpPleb — I keep telling this to the stooges who keep prattling on about the low cost of items — which are far too expensive, last only several washings (delicate cycle only, of course) or several months and are of the poorest quality, completely different from my youth! Reply ↓ Sutter Cane April 25, 2017 at 12:28 pm Given the post and the comments, it actually sounds like the future for retailers that survive doesn’t seem so bleak, IF (big if): 1. They manage to avoid private equity takeover 2. Don’t take on debt 3. Make customer service a priority 4. Sell quality goods a step above the usual Chinese garbage found everywhere else (or at least that can’t be shipped as easily) 4. Keep their stores updated and pleasant to visit What with all of the closures, there might be opportunities for the retailers that survive if they avoid the mistakes of their fallen competitors. But are there any examples of companies out there that are doing these things? Nordstrom? Costco? Anybody? Reply ↓ MyLessThanPrimeBeef April 25, 2017 at 2:42 pm There retailers are national chain retailers. Before them, there were mom-and-pop retailers. They had bleak-future-moment a long, long time ago. Perhaps they will come back one day, when people make enough money to value service again, instead of supporting ‘trade’ as a WSJ poll shows, because trade means affordable junk commensurate with stagnant or declining real wages.

If you need tall sizes for shirts, you used to be able to get these at most every department store, but over the last decade or two almost every department store around these parts was sold and restructured; after these changes the stores always have less inventory for higher prices. Now the only place you can find a wide selection of tall sizes is the internet. Retail clothiers have essentially said we’re not interested in selling things to tall men. And they’re not interested in selling things to large men, or large women, or short people, or old people. How badly should I feel about the disappearance of an industry that decided they had no interest in me whatsoever?

Bonds issued by Guitar Center, the biggest retailer of musical instruments in the world, are languishing at record lows on growing concern that the company is going to be overwhelmed by its roughly $1 billion of outstanding bond debt, part of a debt burden that totals about $1.6 billion, once loans and other borrowings are included. … … in 2007, the company was taken private by Mitt Romney’s former private-equity firm Bain Capital in an LBO valued at $2.1 billion that left it saddled with $1.6 billion of high-yield debt. Coming just ahead of the 2008 financial crisis, the company struggled with its high interest payments for several years. In 2014, its main creditor, private-equity firm Ares Management LLC, took a controlling stake in the company in a deal in which it converted some of its debt into equity, and left Bain as a partial owner with representation on the board. … As Mitt would say, why don’t they get a loan from their parents?

Reply ↓ Pwelder April 25, 2017 at 6:55 pm Ares had a deal down in West Texas with Clayton Williams Energy Inc. (You remember Clayton – he ran for Governor of Texas against Ann Richards) Unfortunately Clayton decided not to hedge his production for 2015-6, just before the Saudis pulled the plug on the oil price in November 2014. All of a sudden CWEI, whose share price had been bouncing around above $100, was two jumps ahead of the sheriff with bankruptcy a real threat. The stock got down to 7. Beginning last March Ares put in a bunch of equity and debt, and it turned out Clayton had squirreled away a ton of acres in the best part of the Permian Basin. With BK off the table the stock price recovered, Noble Energy bought them out for $130+ per share, and Ares made about six times their money in less than a year. What’s interesting for present purposes is there was no asset-stripping or any other shenanigans. Ares took a risk – which looked huge at the time – and made out like bandits. That’s how it’s supposed to work. And the funny thing is, Ares is owned by a bunch of Arabs out in the Middle East. Great piece by Richter and Yves – and a lot of smart commentary from out here in the bleachers. Thanks to all.

It is exactly what Philip Green did at BHS having stripped a £1 billion dividend courtesy of HBOS corruption. This game was well exposed under Robert Campeau decades ago. It is amazing how the old shell games continue. Same story at Karstadt in Germany with Thomas Middlehof and the Arcandor disaster. The Western economic model has been built around Liquidation for decades and the ramping up of liabilities within shell businesses so looters can extract equity and cash.

Jeymar Canales was hospitalized after being taken into protective custody for his “high level of intoxication” by the Grand Junction Police Department, which reported in an arrest affidavit that officers found him after responding to a report that he was throwing rocks at cars near Ridges Boulevard and Ridgeway Court. The security guard told officers he was helping put Canales in restraints at the hospital, when Canales began struggling and hit him in the face, the report said.

Rick Scott on Tuesday for stripping her office of nearly two dozen first-degree murder cases because she refused to consider the death penalty. In the lawsuit filed in federal court, Aramis Ayala challenges Scott's decision to reassign 23 homicide cases to another prosecutor. Ayala, state attorney for the 9th Judicial Circuit, argues the move violated her constitutional rights, harmed her reputation and deprived those who elected her "of the benefit of their votes." "The governor did not take this drastic step because of any misconduct on Ayala's part, but simply because he disagreed with her reasoned prosecutorial determination not to seek the death penalty under current circumstances," the lawsuit says. Scott signed executive orders on March 16, April 3 and April 6 that reassigned the cases to 5th Judicial Circuit State Attorney Brad King, also named as a defendant in the suit. Dispute started with Markeith Loyd case The showdown between Scott and Ayala started when Ayala announced her decision not to seek the death penalty in the high-profile case of Markeith Loyd, accused of killing a police officer, or future cases her office prosecutes. Loyd was captured on January 17 after a nationwide manhunt. He was indicted about a month later in the December 13 shooting death of his ex-girlfriend, Sade Dixon, 24, and in the January 9 death of Orlando police Lt. Debra Clayton, 42, outside a Walmart. "The moment I heard that she had decided not to prosecute Markeith Loyd to the full extent of the law, it bothered me personally," the governor said Tuesday, CNN affiliate WFTV reported. "(Loyd) is accused of murdering a pregnant girlfriend. He's accused of shooting officer Debra Clayton, and when she's down walking up to her and pummeling her with bullets so she died," the governor said in remarks to reporters posted on the Orlando Sentinel website. Scott said he asked Ayala to recuse herself from the Loyd case in March. When she wouldn't, he said he reassigned it to King. King could not be reached on Tuesday. The governor cited the Dixon and Clayton families and that of Orange County Sheriff's Deputy Norman Lewis, who died in a crash during the manhunt for Loyd. "These families deserve a state attorney who will aggressively prosecute Loyd to the fullest extent of the law and justice must be served," he said in a statement Tuesday. Ayala argues that state law gives her "absolute" discretion in deciding whether and how to prosecute cases. The defendants violated her rights "when they assumed the authority to veto the prosecutorial discretion of an independent elected official," the suit says. The lawsuit claims Scott chose King as Ayala's replacement because of his "well-known" public support for the death penalty. Scott's decision was "motivated by a specific desire to influence the course of capital prosecutions in Ayala's circuit," the suit says. Ayala seeks an injunction ordering Scott to reinstate her as prosecutor on the pending cases and barring him from replacing her with any other state official. She also seeks an injunction prohibiting King from assuming her duties. "State Attorney Aramis Ayala has the right to use her discretion to determine how and to what extent she's going to prosecute cases in her district. That is the right that the voters gave her," said her attorney, Roy Austin of Washington, D.C. Ayala says in her suit that she, not King, was elected by voters in her circuit. She became Florida's first African-American state attorney when she was elected in November 2016. Her term began in January. Governor, prosecutor say they prioritize victims Scott and Ayala have cast their positions as a fight for justice, and said their stances consider the families of victims. "State Attorney Ayala's complete refusal to consider capital punishment for the entirety of her term sends an unacceptable message that she is not interested in considering every available option in the fight for justice," Scott said in a statement earlier this month. Scott said Tuesday he would continue to review cases "because I'm going to think about the victim and I'm going to think about the victim's family." In her lawsuit, Ayala says she was willing to seek a death sentence in "appropriate" cases earlier in her career and held that belief throughout her campaign for state attorney. Ayala says she came her decision to seek life without parole in Loyd's case after researching the law and the facts the case. She says she also met with victims' families, reviewed files from other cases and spoke with other individuals involved in the criminal justice system, the lawsuit said.

In her March 16 public announcement not to seek the death penalty, Ayala said capital punishment in Florida had led to "chaos, uncertainty, and turmoil." Ayala argued then that evidence has shown the death penalty is overly expensive, slow, inhumane and does not increase public safety. She said after "extensive and painstaking thought and consideration," she determined that pursing the death penalty "is not in the best interest of this community or the best interest of justice." "Some victims will support and some will surely oppose my decision," Ayala said then. "But I have learned that the death penalty traps many victims, families in a decades-long cycle of uncertainty, court hearings, appeals and waiting." Her lawsuit claims she "was not categorically refusing to ever seek a death sentence" during the Lloyd press conference. There may be cases in which "I think the death penalty may be appropriate because of the egregiousness of the offense," she said then, according to the suit. Ayala: Scott 'mischaracterized' her stance Ayala's suit said the governor asked her to recuse herself when she called him before her March announcement. "She refused and asked him for the opportunity to explain her position. He declined and ended the call after less than 30 seconds," the lawsuit says. The governor issued his March 16 executive order soon after removing her from the Loyd case. The order "mischaracterized Ayala's careful weighing of the circumstances," the lawsuit says. Civil rights groups applauded Ayala's decision, but Orlando police Chief John Mina and victims' families criticized it and urged her to recuse herself from Loyd case.

Life Buy/Sell Multimedia AP Prosecutor sues Florida governor over death penalty cases By Tina Burnside and Darran Simon, CNN Apr 24, 2017 (…) A Florida prosecutor sued Gov. Rick Scott on Tuesday for stripping her office of nearly two dozen first-degree murder cases because she refused to consider the death penalty. In the lawsuit filed in federal court, Aramis Ayala challenges Scott's decision to reassign 23 homicide cases to another prosecutor. Ayala, state attorney for the 9th Judicial Circuit, argues the move violated her constitutional rights, harmed her reputation and deprived those who elected her "of the benefit of their votes." "The governor did not take this drastic step because of any misconduct on Ayala's part, but simply because he disagreed with her reasoned prosecutorial determination not to seek the death penalty under current circumstances," the lawsuit says. Scott signed executive orders on March 16, April 3 and April 6 that reassigned the cases to 5th Judicial Circuit State Attorney Brad King, also named as a defendant in the suit. Dispute started with Markeith Loyd case The showdown between Scott and Ayala started when Ayala announced her decision not to seek the death penalty in the high-profile case of Markeith Loyd, accused of killing a police officer, or future cases her office prosecutes. Loyd was captured on January 17 after a nationwide manhunt. He was indicted about a month later in the December 13 shooting death of his ex-girlfriend, Sade Dixon, 24, and in the January 9 death of Orlando police Lt. Debra Clayton, 42, outside a Walmart. "The moment I heard that she had decided not to prosecute Markeith Loyd to the full extent of the law, it bothered me personally," the governor said Tuesday, CNN affiliate WFTV reported. "(Loyd) is accused of murdering a pregnant girlfriend. He's accused of shooting officer Debra Clayton, and when she's down walking up to her and pummeling her with bullets so she died," the governor said in remarks to reporters posted on the Orlando Sentinel website. Scott said he asked Ayala to recuse herself from the Loyd case in March. When she wouldn't, he said he reassigned it to King. King could not be reached on Tuesday. The governor cited the Dixon and Clayton families and that of Orange County Sheriff's Deputy Norman Lewis, who died in a crash during the manhunt for Loyd. "These families deserve a state attorney who will aggressively prosecute Loyd to the fullest extent of the law and justice must be served," he said in a statement Tuesday. Ayala argues that state law gives her "absolute" discretion in deciding whether and how to prosecute cases. The defendants violated her rights "when they assumed the authority to veto the prosecutorial discretion of an independent elected official," the suit says. The lawsuit claims Scott chose King as Ayala's replacement because of his "well-known" public support for the death penalty. Scott's decision was "motivated by a specific desire to influence the course of capital prosecutions in Ayala's circuit," the suit says. Ayala seeks an injunction ordering Scott to reinstate her as prosecutor on the pending cases and barring him from replacing her with any other state official. She also seeks an injunction prohibiting King from assuming her duties. "State Attorney Aramis Ayala has the right to use her discretion to determine how and to what extent she's going to prosecute cases in her district. That is the right that the voters gave her," said her attorney, Roy Austin of Washington, D.C. Ayala says in her suit that she, not King, was elected by voters in her circuit. She became Florida's first African-American state attorney when she was elected in November 2016. Her term began in January. Governor, prosecutor say they prioritize victims Scott and Ayala have cast their positions as a fight for justice, and said their stances consider the families of victims. "State Attorney Ayala's complete refusal to consider capital punishment for the entirety of her term sends an unacceptable message that she is not interested in considering every available option in the fight for justice," Scott said in a statement earlier this month. Scott said Tuesday he would continue to review cases "because I'm going to think about the victim and I'm going to think about the victim's family." In her lawsuit, Ayala says she was willing to seek a death sentence in "appropriate" cases earlier in her career and held that belief throughout her campaign for state attorney. Ayala says she came her decision to seek life without parole in Loyd's case after researching the law and the facts the case. She says she also met with victims' families, reviewed files from other cases and spoke with other individuals involved in the criminal justice system, the lawsuit said. In her March 16 public announcement not to seek the death penalty, Ayala said capital punishment in Florida had led to "chaos, uncertainty, and turmoil." Ayala argued then that evidence has shown the death penalty is overly expensive, slow, inhumane and does not increase public safety. She said after "extensive and painstaking thought and consideration," she determined that pursing the death penalty "is not in the best interest of this community or the best interest of justice." "Some victims will support and some will surely oppose my decision," Ayala said then. "But I have learned that the death penalty traps many victims, families in a decades-long cycle of uncertainty, court hearings, appeals and waiting." Her lawsuit claims she "was not categorically refusing to ever seek a death sentence" during the Lloyd press conference. There may be cases in which "I think the death penalty may be appropriate because of the egregiousness of the offense," she said then, according to the suit. Ayala: Scott 'mischaracterized' her stance Ayala's suit said the governor asked her to recuse herself when she called him before her March announcement. "She refused and asked him for the opportunity to explain her position. He declined and ended the call after less than 30 seconds," the lawsuit says. The governor issued his March 16 executive order soon after removing her from the Loyd case. The order "mischaracterized Ayala's careful weighing of the circumstances," the lawsuit says. Civil rights groups applauded Ayala's decision, but Orlando police Chief John Mina and victims' families criticized it and urged her to recuse herself from Loyd case. This month, King filed a notice that he intends to seek the death penalty against Loyd. Capital punishment was recently in limbo in Florida for a brief period. The US Supreme Court ruled in January 2016 that Florida's death penalty process was unconstitutional because it let judges have the final say, even when a jury's decision was not unanimous. The governor signed a bill into law in March abolishing non-unanimous jury recommendations for death and requiring unanimous jury recommendations before a trial judge may impose a death sentence.

It is disturbing that someone would take issue with handicapped accessibility (note the earlier author’s reference to using electric chairs to go to Wal-Mart). Some folks do not have easily accessible means of transportation. Sidewalks seem like a wonderful [auth] way for folks to have additional shopping/community access; 2. Walking facing traffic is much safer since it is easier to see the occasional hurried driver turning into a business in front of you while you are in a crossing area in front of said business. 3. How many times has the writer of the earlier letter walked in many of the neighborhoods? There are tree roots uplifting many of the stones making for uneven footing, especially during early morning and late evening when the light is dim. An article in the RDR within the last year noted that it was an owner’s responsibility to maintain a sidewalk in front of his/her residence, but failure to do so was not enforced. I have found walking in the street facing traffic a much safer alternative to using many of the neighborhood sidewalks. 4. Some areas have no sidewalks or sidewalks end abruptly. These are just a few reasons that I am happy to see the installation of the sidewalk on the northwest side of Main Street. Not only is there disabled access but many of the visitors (as well as residents) who enjoy walking can go from the north part of town to the south safely.

Trudeau has been walking a communications tightrope in recent days, refusing to speak directly to the president's executive order banning immigrants from seven majority-Muslim countries. Trudeau, who was in Yellowknife Friday, says there are many areas where he sees eye-to-eye with Trump, including jobs for the middle class and economic growth. ——— TRUDEAU DEFENDS HANDLING OF ELECTORAL REFORM: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says he abandoned a promise to overhaul Canada's electoral system because he was afraid the result would be political discord and instability. He told a town hall in Yellowknife that he knows people are disappointed but suggests he's prepared to accept the political consequences, whatever they may be. He explained that the idea of a ranked ballot was abandoned because too many people believed it would be a system that would favour the governing Liberals. ——— QUEBEC STUDENT BLOCKED FROM ENTERING U.S.: A Quebec student athlete is mystified as to why he was barred from entering the U.S. this week. Yassine Aber underwent a five-hour interrogation in which he was asked about religion and his Moroccan roots. The track and field athlete with the Universite de Sherbrooke said he was travelling to a weekend competition in Boston on Thursday when he ran into trouble at the Stanstead crossing on the Quebec-Vermont border. Aber was told he did not have a valid passport or visa to enter the country. Aber, who was born and raised in Sherbrooke, Que., says his Canadian passport is valid and does not expire until 2026. ——— TRUMP SAYS HE'LL PREVAIL ON TRAVEL BAN: U.S. President Donald Trump says his administration will do whatever is necessary to keep the country safe. And he says he has "no doubt" that he will win the court fight over his travel ban. His comments at a news conference came hours after Trump tweeted that Wednesday's appeals court decision on the ban was "disgraceful." The court ruled against reinstating the refugee and immigration order. Speaking at a White House news conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Trump says the administration will continue to work the case through the court process ——— PAYPAL FREEZES MEDIA ORGANIZATION'S ACCOUNT: A community newspaper's payment to enter a feel-good story about a family of Syrian refugees in an awards competition prompted PayPal to freeze the account of a national media organization as a suspicious transaction. The weekly Flin Flon Reminder entered the article as part of its submissions to the annual Canadian Community Newspaper Awards. Flin Flon publisher, Valerie Durnin, said when she tried to pay the $242.95 for the paper's entries, PayPal flagged the payment as possibly not in compliance with its "acceptable use policy." In an email, PayPal promised to follow up within 72 hours of its investigation, which it never did. Instead it reversed the payment. ——— CLASS ACTION SUIT FILED AGAINST WALMART CANADA: A Calgary-based law firm has launched a class-action suit against Walmart Canada, alleging the retailer sold potentially contaminated food after the Fort McMurray wildfire. The lawsuit seeks damages for anyone who was not refunded for food that had to be thrown out — whether or not it was contaminated — as well as anyone who got sick. The Alberta government has charged Walmart with 174 violations of the province's Public Health Act. Some of the charges include failing to dispose of food items, including candy, potato chips, beans and condiments. Walmart did not comment on the allegations, which have not been proven in court. ——— JOBLESS RATE FALLS MARGINALLY: Canada's jobless rate dropped marginally in January to 6.8 per cent from 6.9 per cent. Statistics Canada says there was an increase in part-time jobs and a lesser gain in full time work. Economists described the overall job growth as "very impressive" and "remarkably strong." ——— CANADA'S EAST AND WEST COASTS GET BLAST OF WINTER: Snow storms caused havoc in both the Atlantic provinces and British Columbia's south coast Friday. Drivers in parts of the Maritimes faced snow squalls and blinding whiteouts as a fast-moving winter storm blew into Atlantic Canada. Parts of southwestern New Brunswick ended up with more than 30 centimetres of snow. The storm in British Columbia tied traffic in knots between the south coast and the interior. ——— POLICE TO SKIP CANADA'S LARGEST PRIDE PARADE: Toronto Police Chief Mark Saunders says his force won't participate in the city's annual pride parade. Saunders pointed to divisions within the LGBTQ community as the primary reason for his decision, but emphasized it "will have no impact" on the force's outreach efforts. The presence of police in the parade emerged as a contentious issue when the parade was interrupted last summer by a protest from the local chapter of Black Lives Matter. ——— BC PREMIER APOLOGIZES FOR HACKING CLAIM: British Columbia Premier Christy Clark has apologized to New Democrat Leader John Horgan over her accusations that the Opposition was involved in criminal hacking of her Liberal party's website. Clark said she made a mistake and jumped to conclusions. The apology came as an Independent member of the legislature came forward to say her staff had access to the private information — without any attempt at hacking. Vicki Huntington says her staff uncovered the private information on the B.C. Liberals website while looking for 2016 donations to the party. ——— © Copyright 2017 Prince George Citizen Email to a Friend Your Email Address: * Your Name: * To Email Address: * Message: * * Please separate multiple email addresses with the semi-colon character.

JESSICA NYZNIK/Postmedia Tweet Change text size for the story Print Report an error Lise Fredette's children pleaded with their mother's killer to tell them where her body is. "If you ever loved my mom, like you said you did, the only decent thing to do would be to tell us where my mom is so we can put an end to all this," said Nathalie Leclerc, Ms. Fredette's daughter. Leclerc read her victim impact statement in court Monday during Andrew Watson's sentencing. He was convicted of the first-degree murder of Ms. Fredette on Thursday. Ms. Fredette's daughter cried as she addressed the man who killed her mom. Watson sat with his head down in the prisoner's box. He opted out of wearing the court's headset to help him hear. "I'm not interested," Watson told his lawyer when he tried to give him the headset. Leclerc went to her mother's house Nov. 13, 2014 after receiving a phone call from Walmart saying her mom hadn't shown up to work. "That day in November when I walked into my mom's driveway - the day that changed our life forever - I could not ever imagine...that someone had killed my mother," said Leclerc. Ms. Fredette was last seen the night before by the co-worker she dropped off on her way home. Despite numerous police and community searches, her body has never been found. Watson, 79, stalked his ex-girlfriend before eventually attacking her in her driveway, killing her and hiding the body. "I used to love going to my mom's place. It was such a happy and comforting place...now it has become a scary place, because I know that's where my mom was killed," Leclerc said. A mother of two, Leclerc said her mother didn't deserve what happened to her and Ms. Fredette's family didn't deserve what Watson was continuing to do by not letting them lay her to rest. "I hope that some day, Andy, you can find it in your heart to please tell us where my mom is," she said. The courtroom was filled with friends of Ms. Fredette's. Five of the 12 jurors in the trial also sat in on the sentencing. Watson received a life sentence with no chance of parole for 25 years. His Subaru was also confiscated by the Crown. Ms. Fredette's son also read a statement he'd written. "What happened, Andy? You told me and promised me you'd never hurt my mom," said Stéphane Leclerc. Watson and Fredette, 74, dated off and on for a few years, ending the relationship for good in April 2014. Stéphane said he used to think of Watson as a gentlemen, as someone he respected. They'd shared drinks together and family dinners. "Little did I know, you'd be the demise of my family," he said. Ms. Fredette's son told Watson he was denying the family the most basic and the last act of respect and decency they could offer Ms. Fredette. "Be a man and do the right thing by allowing us to give our mother the respect and dignity as she so rightly deserves," he said. Stéphane asked for a moment to recognize his mother, Lorraine Roach and her children and Joanne MacKenzie and her daughter - all women who've disappeared. Unlike Ms. Fredette and Ms. MacKenzie, whose former boyfriend's were convicted of their murders, Roach's disappearance has not led to any criminal charges. "Their sudden disappearances...have left gaping holes where there was once a family unit," Stéphane said.   Featured Businesses Contact us to Advertise » Insurance Rivet Insurance Services DOMES ELECTRIC Insurance Rivet Insurance Go to the Marketplace » Local Businesses Advertise with us Contribute Send Your Scoop!

PDT April 24, 2017 A wind farm in Gilliam County, Oregon. (Photo: KGW) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST PORTLAND, Ore. -- One of the world's biggest brands is making an environmental investment in Oregon. Apple has announced it's financing two solar panel and wind farms in Central Oregon. The electricity they'll generate will power Apple's three data centers near Bend. It's going to save enough fossil fuels to power 65,000 homes every year. Experts are hoping a company as big as Apple is enough to push others like Walmart and Facebook, which has also data centers in Oregon, into the same mindset. From Portland, if you fly over the Cascades and zoom in on Southwest Millican Road in Prineville, Google Earth shows nothing but juniper and sagebrush. But under construction there right now, is a huge solar panel farm, commissioned for Apple. It will be completed next year. In their environmental report released on Earth Day, the company says 100 percent of the solar energy harnessed at the farm will go to power the company's three data centers a few miles away. Farther north in Gilliam County, Apple says it's also backing construction of a new wind turbine farm to funnel power back to Prineville. Apple's goal is to have all it's facilities worldwide on renewable energy. "You need to have leaders in this kind of thing," said Rachel Shimshak, executive director of Renewable Northwest. Shimshak says not only is it great public relations for Apple to stop using fossil fuels, it's obviously good for the environment, it's getting comparable in price to regular electricity and it helps local counties with jobs and subsidies. "Customers really value companies who want to do well by the environment and I think Apple has stepped to the front of the line, along with others, to recognize what customers want from them and show they're going to give it to them." Facebook also has three data centers in Prineville, but hasn't delved into renewable energy yet in our state. It's because Oregon's Public Utility Commission doesn't make the "transition charge" cheap to switch from regular fossil fuels to solar or wind. Walmart agrees, saying it's not cost effective yet in Oregon. The legislature is working on it, but Apple didn't seem to mind. Shimsahk says you'll see more households and companies moving that way as more of these farms get built. "Over the next several years, the utilities are going to transfer out of coal resources and grow the amount of renewable resources that meet their needs," she said. Nike is another company that has made the transition to buying renewable energy in Oregon. According to research by the Portland Business Journal, Nike buys wind power from a plant in the Gorge. It's also beneficial for household customers. Right now, if you're a Portland General Electric or Pacific Power customer, you can call them and ask to switch to renewable energy. It might cost a few cents more a month, but Shimshak says it's getting closer to the same price every year. And instead of installing solar panels on your own roof, thanks to a new bill passed in 2016, soon you'll be able to invest in a community solar panel farm to share the electricity with your neighbors. © 2017 KGW-TV CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST JOIN THE CONVERSATION To find out more about Facebook commenting please read the Conversation Guidelines and FAQs Leave a Comment TRENDING VIDEOS George Fox University student missing Attack at Iraqi restaurant caught on camera Marine arrested after attack on Portland Iraqi restaurant Ilani casino grand opening draws thousands Police say hash oil lab exploded, injured man 82nd Avenue or Roses parade canceled Apple launches Oregon solar/wind farms Car of missing Camas teen found, body inside Wyoming engineer wins Nike sneaker contest Man arrested in hash oil lab explosion More Stories Korean War veteran says he was punched in road rage attack Apr 25, 2017, 8:43 p.m. Missing hitchhiker last seen in Hood River found dead Mar 28, 2017, 6:42 p.m. 82nd Avenue of Roses Parade canceled due to threats Apr 25, 2017, 3:48 p.m. About Us Contact Us Reporters Index Help Connect With Us FCC Online Public Inspection File • EEO Public File Report Home Weather 7 Day Forecast Closings Weather Alerts Radars Live Cameras hyperlocal-radars More...

Prev Next At tonight's meeting, the city council approved an incentive package for Oldacre McDonald, the firm that has purchased and plans to renovate the Wildwood South shopping center. The plans were first introduced last summer, and include two roundabouts, an inter-parking lot road, the construction of several new retail spaces, new monument signs, additional lighting, new paint, landscaping and metal awnings to replace the current fabric ones. Some work has already been in progress, including a new freestanding Starbucks building that the tenant will take possession of this Wednesday. The incentive plan approved tonight will split any increase in sales tax revenue on the property equally between the city and Oldacre McDonald. This does not include the percent of the tax allotted to schools, nor sales tax revenue from Walmart and Sam's Club. This agreement will last for 10 years and earnings are capped at up to $5 million in revenue during that time. Bill Oldacre, who was present tonight, said he remembers the shopping center's "glory days" of the 1990s and believes with renovation and new tenants, it can return to that success. However, he said recent years have given the center something of a reputation problem to overcome. "I saw that center at its heights, and I saw it on its way down," Oldacre said. "There's no reason it can't be successful." Since part of the shopping center is in Birmingham city limits, Oldacre McDonald has negotiated a separate incentive package for that area of the property. Birmingham council member Jay Roberson also spoke tonight in support of the incentive agreement. The council approved the agreement unanimously. They also voted to spend $30,000 from the proceeds of the city's $110 million bond for Homewood City Schools to hire a demographer. The chosen demographer, Cooperative Strategies, will work for two to three months to determine enrollment projections based on current enrollment, growth rate, economic developments, live birth and population data and housing trends. The demographic results will help the school system determine its plans for expanding its facilities to accommodate student population growth. Cooperative Strategies has recently worked on similar projects in school systems in Auburn and Huntsville. The school board is also interviewing project management firms Friday at 9 a.m. for the expansion project. Superintendent Bill Cleveland said they hope to have a decision for the council to approve in early May. The council also took time out of its meeting to recognize Homewood Fire Department's retiring battalion chief, Brian Bonner. Bonner has served the city for 22 years, rising from a firefighter and paramedic to the battalion chief position. "He's done an awful lot for the city of Homewood," Mayor Scott McBrayer said. "We love you, we're going to miss you. Fire Chief John Bresnan said Bonner didn't want "fanfare" for his retirement, so Bresnan took the council meeting as an opportunity to publicly thank him. "There is not a finer individual who's ever worked in the fire service," Bresnan said. The council also: Approved funding to create schematics for plans to add parking, sidewalks and crosswalks on Central Avenue. Approved new streetlights in Rosedale on 17th Place South at 25th Court and on Central Avenue between 27th Avenue South and 27th Court South. Additionally, Ward 1 Representative Britt Thames said members of the Rosedale community have sent letters to owners of properties that could be considered public nuisances due to unsafe or neglected structures. Thames said they're waiting to see the response to these letters before deciding whether to pursue legal abatement proceedings in a month or so. Approved a sign variance for McDonald's at 124 State Farm Parkway. The McDonald's is replacing its signs and wants to add two more attached signs than the city ordinance allows. Approved three residents to work in the city right-of-way in the alley adjacent to 1504-1508 Melrose Place for better vehicle access. Approved declaration of 2827 and 2831 16th Place South public nuisances due to excessive growth and litter. Approved Creative Montessori School to work in the city right-of-way at 2800 Montessori Way during the construction of a retaining wall, which will not be in the right-of-way. Authorized a voting delegate from the council to attend the Alabama League of Municipalities annual convention in May. Approved a contract with Sprint Solutions for communication services. Approved the mayor to sign an agreement reassigning the American Tower Lease to Allcom Radio. Set a May 8 public hearing to consider a driveway ordinance violation. Set a May 8 public hearing to consider a request to rezone 285 Palisades Boulevard from Office Building District to Green Springs Urban Renewal District.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 25 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Why Whole Foods Market, Inc. Shareholders Have Something to Worry About The past few weeks have seen shares of Whole Foods (NASDAQ: WFM) advance over 25% on speculation that the company might sell itself. Jana Partners took an 8.8% position in the company, and there are rumors that Amazon and Kroger (NYSE: KR) could be potential suitors. It wouldn’t be shocking to see such a move. Over the past decade, the industry has seen massive consolidation: Harris Teeter, Roundy’s, Safeway, and Supervalu ‚s grocery stores have all gone private or been acquired. And they all went for premium prices. Image source: Pixabay But an acquisition is far from a sure thing. And potential acquirers and shareholders alike have a host of issues to worry about. These are the three biggest. What makes you so special? Let’s go back 10 years. In 2007, some chains were dipping their toes in the organic pool, but tepidly. Then, the Great Recession hit and all the interest in the niche went out the window. While Whole Foods had its own struggles, it was a huge benefactor: it had the entire organic sandbox to itself. That was critical, because it meant booming business once the economy started recovering. Grocery stores are normally pleased to see comparable store sales (comps) grow slightly ahead of inflation, but from 2010 to 2013 Whole Foods crushed these expectations. Data source: Annual Reports That success, however, didn’t go unnoticed. Competition soon followed: Costco , Wal-Mart and — most importantly with its private label — Kroger all became huge vendors of organic fare. Just as importantly, they were doing it cheaper than Whole Foods. Back in 2011, while Whole Foods had a reputation for high prices, it still offered organic goods for less  than the competition. But just two years later, that advantage had vanished into thin air. The problem was simple: commoditization. There’s nothing Whole Foods does that other grocers can’t. As demand for organic goods has grown, more and more farmers around the world have signed on. But they aren’t all beholden to Whole Foods, and if the Krogers of the world can offer the same thing for less money — and they have far more convenient locations to shop at — then Whole Foods is plumb out of luck. That’s exactly what’s happened at the company. Data source: Annual Reports In the fact, one recent analyst estimated that Whole Foods had lost 14 million customers over the past 18 months, mostly to Krogers. On profit margins, balance sheets, and management overhaul Whole Foods rightly earned the „Whole Paycheck” moniker. For a long time, that wasn’t a bad thing: the company enjoyed profit margins other grocers could only dream of. After the cost of goods, employee salaries, real estate, electricity, and everything else involved in running a store are factored in, the average grocer will be lucky if it can pocket $0.02 for every dollar spent as profit — a 2% margin. But Whole Foods routinely doubled that mark. Once competition came in, however, the company got serious about „investments in price.” That’s Wall Street talk for simply lowering the prices of your goods. When you combine that dip with slower traffic, this is what happens to your profit margins. Data source: Annual and quarterly reports. MRQ=Most Recent Quarter In essence, this means that the amount of cash Whole Foods gets to keep as profit has dipped over 50% since 2013! At the same time, management has made odd long-term financial decisions. After eschewing debt following the Great Recession, the company decided to take on $1 billion in low-interest loans. Obviously, that could help expand the pace of store openings, and perhaps be used for nationwide marketing. Instead, it was used for dividends and share buybacks. Even as a former shareholder, that was a real head-scratcher. It seemed the company was more focused on propping up the stock for the short-term than in creating long-term value. Perhaps there was dissent in the C-Suite over this, because shortly thereafter co-CEO Walter Robb stepped down. That left founder John Mackey (who is also on The Motley Fool’s board of directors) as the lone CEO. Since then, he has signaled that instead of trying to gain market share at all costs, Whole Foods would return to focusing on high-end clients. That’s probably a good move, as it’s the one area where Whole Foods’ brand name can function as a moat and differentiator from the competition. But it’s awfully expensive Under normal circumstances, I might even consider buying shares. I like the new focus, and the fact that Mackey is calling the shots. However, shares are simply too expensive: they trade for 27 times future earnings, and 29 times trailing free cash flow. For a company with negative comps, that’s far too much. Shareholders might luck out if potential suitors see the situation differently, but if that doesn’t happen, there’s still a host of problems to worry about as the company undergoes its transition to Whole Foods 2.0. 10 stocks we like better than Whole Foods Market When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 25 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Want a Nintendo Switch Now? Expect to Pay Up Nintendo (NASDAQOTH: NTDOY) has made a big splash with its new Switch console, but production can’t keep up with demand. You can get a Switch now if you buy it from a third-party seller, but expect to pay a hefty premium. In this segment of the Industry Focus: Consumer Goods  podcast, analyst Vincent Shen and contributor Seth McNew discuss new games for Switch and other news for the growing video game industry. A full transcript follows the video. 10 stocks we like better than Nintendo When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, Motley Fool Stock Advisor , has tripled the market.* David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now… and Nintendo wasn’t one of them! That’s right — they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. Click here to learn about these picks! *Stock Advisor returns as of April 3, 2017 This video was recorded on April 13, 2017. Vincent Shen: This is the newest video game console from Nintendo that was originally unveiled last October, and made its official debut on March 3. In its six weeks on the market, the Switch continues to fly off store shelves. If you go to the official Nintendo Switch product page online, they have links to retail partners where you should technically be able to buy one of these consoles. I actually checked all six of them — Best Buy , GameStop , Target , Wal-Mart , and Toys „R” Us. Can you guess, Seth, whether or not I was able to find a Switch available at those retail partners? Seth McNew: I would say probably not. If you’re looking places like eBay , you can definitely get one if you’re willing to pay a little bit of a premium. Shen: Yes, exactly. Amazon was also one of the partners. It’s available only from third-party sellers, not from Amazon themselves. They’re charging a premium, like you said, in the face of such high demand. So, buyers can expect to pay at least $360, when the Switch’s official MSRP is $299. I got curious, I did go to eBay to see what people had been willing to pony up to get their hands on one of these consoles, and more recent listings are similarly going for around $400. In the initial weeks after the release, when the frenzy was really building up and people had to get their hands on one, there were some listing for the Switch console being sold for well over $1,000. McNew: That’s absurd. Shen: Pretty incredible. All of this incredible hype bears out in sales for the console in numbers that we’ve seen. There’s a report from DIGITIMES that said, based on estimates from Nintendo’s supply chain partners, the company could end up shipping as many as 20 million units in its first year. Looking out further, the president of Nintendo sees a lifetime total for the console of potentially 110 million units, which would far eclipse the previous generation, Wii U. McNew: 110 million units, but we don’t know how long it’s going to take for them to actually produce that many. At this rate, it could be a few years before they’re able to get that out. Shen: Yeah. It’ll take several years for them to even get that number. Recently, they doubled their shipping estimates from 8 [million] to 16 million. I think that’s going up again to potentially this 20 million number that we’re seeing. But our biggest concern last episode, in addition to their inability to meet some of this demand, every store being sold out, there was also a concern about a relative lack of top-tier game titles. But with these kinds of forecasts, I have to imagine at this point the developers are getting pretty excited about tapping into this corner of the console market. What do you think? Is that something, with these kinds of numbers, that people, especially third-party developers, are perking up their ears and thinking to themselves, „It’s time to get in on this.” McNew: Yeah, I think so. You’re right that when the Switch came out it had such a lean amount of titles that came with it. They have already announced some pretty interesting new titles. Mario Kart is coming out this month, which is going to be a hit, I’m sure. Then, other games like Minecraft , Ubisoft has talked about Monopoly is coming out soon. So, you’re having these very classic games like Pac-Man that you would expect for this kind of console, but you have some new franchises as well that are coming out as well, some different sports games. And then, I think it lends itself well to some competition. They talk about a Mario Kart competition. But, as we talked about last time I was here, with e-sports, this mobile gaming, it seems like such an easy way to get into that online competitive space. So, I would imagine a lot of third-party developers are pretty interested in that aspect. Shen: I think Nintendo has also done its part with this specific console, a better job than they did with the Wii U, and that is making the platform more attractive to third-party developers. They’re supporting common game engines that make it easier to create the games and the titles for the console. Something that might be more important, you mentioned e-sports, but there’s also this online gaming element. The company has announced that there will be an online gaming platform for the Switch that will launch later this year. Initial testing has already started. Like its biggest competitors, Nintendo will actually start charging players for access to this service. That adds another income stream on one hand. On the other hand, I think game developers will be attracted, because you want a robust online player base for additional opportunities to monetize their titles. You look at Activision Blizzard , Electronic Arts , they’re making 60% to 75% of their sales digitally, and it becomes very clear how important getting this online platform right will be for Nintendo. Moving on, also making waves in the space recently was Microsoft . The tech giant released some additional details for its Project Scorpio. The official reveal will happen at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in June. But, the gist of it is, you get more powerful hardware, better graphics, 4K compatibility, and support for virtual reality headsets. As we discussed a little bit on the last show, titles will be compatible across Xbox One, the Xbox One S, and Scorpio, so game developers will be a very favorable position where they can work on one title and tap into bigger player basis than they have in the past.

Shareholders Have Something to Worry About Talk of a possible buyout doesn't eliminate these obvious threats. Brian Stoffel (TMFCheesehead) Apr 24, 2017 at 7:14PM The past few weeks have seen shares of Whole Foods (NASDAQ:WFM) advance over 25% on speculation that the company might sell itself. Jana Partners took an 8.8% position in the company, and there are rumors that Amazon and Kroger (NYSE:KR) could be potential suitors. It wouldn't be shocking to see such a move. Over the past decade, the industry has seen massive consolidation: Harris Teeter, Roundy's, Safeway, and Supervalu's grocery stores have all gone private or been acquired. And they all went for premium prices. Image source: Pixabay But an acquisition is far from a sure thing. And potential acquirers and shareholders alike have a host of issues to worry about. These are the three biggest. What makes you so special? Let's go back 10 years. In 2007, some chains were dipping their toes in the organic pool, but tepidly. Then, the Great Recession hit and all the interest in the niche went out the window. While Whole Foods had its own struggles, it was a huge benefactor: it had the entire organic sandbox to itself. That was critical, because it meant booming business once the economy started recovering. Grocery stores are normally pleased to see comparable store sales (comps) grow slightly ahead of inflation, but from 2010 to 2013 Whole Foods crushed these expectations. Data source: Annual Reports That success, however, didn't go unnoticed. Competition soon followed: Costco, Wal-Mart and -- most importantly with its private label -- Kroger all became huge vendors of organic fare. Just as importantly, they were doing it cheaper than Whole Foods. Back in 2011, while Whole Foods had a reputation for high prices, it still offered organic goods for less than the competition. But just two years later, that advantage had vanished into thin air. The problem was simple: commoditization. There's nothing Whole Foods does that other grocers can't. As demand for organic goods has grown, more and more farmers around the world have signed on. But they aren't all beholden to Whole Foods, and if the Krogers of the world can offer the same thing for less money -- and they have far more convenient locations to shop at -- then Whole Foods is plumb out of luck. That's exactly what's happened at the company. Data source: Annual Reports   In the fact, one recent analyst estimated that Whole Foods had lost 14 million customers over the past 18 months, mostly to Krogers. On profit margins, balance sheets, and management overhaul Whole Foods rightly earned the "Whole Paycheck" moniker. For a long time, that wasn't a bad thing: the company enjoyed profit margins other grocers could only dream of. After the cost of goods, employee salaries, real estate, electricity, and everything else involved in running a store are factored in, the average grocer will be lucky if it can pocket $0.02 for every dollar spent as profit -- a 2% margin. But Whole Foods routinely doubled that mark. Once competition came in, however, the company got serious about "investments in price." That's Wall Street talk for simply lowering the prices of your goods. When you combine that dip with slower traffic, this is what happens to your profit margins. Data source: Annual and quarterly reports. MRQ=Most Recent Quarter   In essence, this means that the amount of cash Whole Foods gets to keep as profit has dipped over 50% since 2013! At the same time, management has made odd long-term financial decisions. After eschewing debt following the Great Recession, the company decided to take on $1 billion in low-interest loans. Obviously, that could help expand the pace of store openings, and perhaps be used for nationwide marketing. Instead, it was used for dividends and share buybacks. Even as a former shareholder, that was a real head-scratcher. It seemed the company was more focused on propping up the stock for the short-term than in creating long-term value. Perhaps there was dissent in the C-Suite over this, because shortly thereafter co-CEO Walter Robb stepped down. That left founder John Mackey (who is also on The Motley Fool's board of directors) as the lone CEO. Since then, he has signaled that instead of trying to gain market share at all costs, Whole Foods would return to focusing on high-end clients. That's probably a good move, as it's the one area where Whole Foods' brand name can function as a moat and differentiator from the competition. But it's awfully expensive  Under normal circumstances, I might even consider buying shares. I like the new focus, and the fact that Mackey is calling the shots. However, shares are simply too expensive: they trade for 27 times future earnings, and 29 times trailing free cash flow. For a company with negative comps, that's far too much. Shareholders might luck out if potential suitors see the situation differently, but if that doesn't happen, there's still a host of problems to worry about as the company undergoes its transition to Whole Foods 2.0.

By Reg Henry / Pittsburgh Post-Gazette Many Americans are greeting the first 100 days of the Trump administration with weeping and gnashing of teeth. Not me. I am Mr. Optimism and Good Cheer. I am for walking on the sunny side of the street while the climate is still temperate enough to allow that. So today, let us count all the good things that have occurred since the inauguration while gloomy people were moping. First, President Grump hasn’t started a nuclear war with North Korea (yet). There’s still time to build a classic 1950s shelter. His administration has adopted a very sensible policy for countering the paranoid North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, he of the strange haircut. It basically amounts to shaking a large stick at him so he will forget to feel paranoid and maybe even visit a regular barber. Have you ever tried this with a paranoid person in your neighborhood who is walking down the street yelling wild things? No, I haven’t either, but I am sure it would be helpful. If push comes to shove, we can be confident that our armed forces are up to the task. They were in a shocking state just a few months ago — Mr. Grump suggested so on the campaign trail — but miraculously when the new president came on board they suddenly became the best again. They misplaced a carrier battle group the other day. The administration said it was going to Korea when at the time it was actually steaming to Australia. Fortunately, the ships were soon found and turned around, which was a good thing as you can’t have admirals saying, “What the heck? I know those ships are around somewhere.” Of course, fair-minded Americans recognize this could happen to anyone as Korea and Australia are often confused. People talk about the fog of war, but the fog of peace can be just as impenetrable, especially if you are new to the job and bring your own fogginess. Fortunately, the president has recruited China to help us deal with the bad-haircut guy. They have promised to do as little as they can but will continue to sell us stuff for Wal-Mart and Ivanka can also sell fashion items to them. So everything is swell. Moreover, the Chinese president gave our president a great little lecture about North Korea — better than TED Talks without Ted, better even than the lectures available to students at Trump U., assuming they were not already in bankruptcy. Now he is an expert in the field and can tell you that kimchi is not the North Korean defense secretary. Unfortunately, Mr. Grump apparently didn’t take the opportunity to scold the Chinese for starting the climate-change hoax. This shows what a natural diplomat he is, not wishing to offend without proof they are Muslim or Mexican. What we need in this country is more methane, a manly sort of gas that spells employment. Breathing is overrated anyway. We can’t have effete liberals sitting around tasting the air like wine snobs. No, what we need are people busy at jobs fueled by fossil fuels promoted by fossil politicians. Americans can grow bigger noses if they need more air or else have them surgically enhanced, which would be a boost to the health care industry. Ah, health care. One little temporary hiccup occurred in the unveiling of Trumpcare, which is going to be the greatest innovation in the medical world since the application of leeches to infected wounds. Did you know that stupidity will not count as a pre-existing condition? The health of insurance companies will soon be restored and we will all be dying to see that. The best thing Mr. Grump has done is to destroy the idea of role models, which was a concept invented by academics, some wearing beards and sandals, and then propagated on daytime TV by media personalities. The idea was always nonsense. Little kids were coerced to go against their natures and emulate all sorts of unsuitable characters chosen by the media. Mr. Grump has broken that myth forever. Who wants to have their kid grow up to be a swaggering, untruthful, name-calling, bullying braggart? Why, a kid like that could end up as president of the United States! George Washington was said to have chopped down a cherry tree as a child but did not lie when confronted. If young Donald Grump chopped down a cherry tree, he would say: “It’s fake news. Obama chopped it down!” What a blessing he has been to us these 100 days.

'Your child is amazing Mommy. Be strong. Keep your head up,' she wrote on a note attached to Heustess's carryout order. 'You are doing a great job. Have a great night. [heart] Your server, Kailyn.' A Georgia server named Kailyn gave Jamie Mathews Heustess (R) the support she needed when the setting restaurant proved too much for her autistic son, Ian (R), on Friday Heustess now has the note hanging on her refrigerator at home, for those times when she 'needs to be reminded of the kindness of strangers' and when parenting a child with autism it's just a little bit tougher than usual.   Their server had visited their table 'five or six times' to try to get her family's order when she finally told her it would only be a to-go order, Heustess explained in a Facebook post from Friday. Her husband had taken Ian home to reduce the stimuli around him, after a long day of karate, awards and shopping. Heustess now has the note hanging on her refrigerator at home, for those times when she 'needs to be reminded of the kindness of strangers' and when parenting a child with autism it's just a little bit tougher than usual 'Our server was gracious and sweet,' Heustess wrote in her post; she said her faith in humanity had been restored after the Cracker Barrel encounter 'By this time I was crying and having a moment, not because I was embarrassed that my son is autistic, but because he is a good kid and I didn't want anyone to think he was just a spoiled kid being a brat,' Heustess wrote in her post.  'Our server was gracious and sweet. She said it was not a problem, that she would get my order in quickly.' About 15 minutes later, Heustess's food was ready and when she went to pay, Kailyn said it had been taken care of.

Her tears kept flowing as she walked out of the restaurant; That's when she noticed the piece of paper stapled to the bag holding her dinner was not a receipt like she initially thought 'In the midst of my own meltdown she reached out with words of encouragement and a kind heart. I am very thankful,' she said. Heustess later learned that Kailyn had planned to pay for Heustess's meal out of her own tips, but when the store's manager, James, learned of the situation, he took care of the bill.

Heustess later learned that Kailyn had planned to pay for Heustess's meal out of her own tips, but when the store's manager, James, learned of the situation, he took care of the bill 'I had a good cry walking out of our local Cracker Barrel in Pooler, Ga this evening... I had posted earlier about the trials and adventures of trying to have a dinner out when you have a child with autism. It is truly hit or miss...most days we do ok. After Chris and Ian left, our waitress came to ask if we were ordering. This was probably her 5th or 6th time stopping by the table...I said yes, a to go order, just for me. She asked if my husband or son wanted anything and I said no, my husband took our son home to reduce stimuli around him. I told her Ian was autistic and had had a long day, awards, karate, Wal-Mart.... His breaking point was the Nemo/Dory toy-that was neither of those characters. By this time I was crying and having a moment, not because I was embarrassed that my son is autistic, but because he is a good kid and I didn't want anyone to think he was just a spoiled kid being a brat. Our server was gracious and sweet. She said it was not a problem, that she would get my order in quickly. I sat quietly and made a post to my page about the realities of autism that you never quite know until you experience it. About 15 minutes later, out comes my server with my bag of dinner. She smiled and told me that my dinner had been taken care of, no need for payment. I started crying all over again. I asked if she was sure and she reassured me it was taken care of, not to worry. I cried walking out, sure the other customers and employees thought I was crazy. There was a piece of paper stapled to my bag, I thought it wad the receipt.....no.... it was something far more precious. In the midst of my own meltdown she reached out with words of encouragement and a kind heart. I am very thankful. EDITED TO ADD: Little did I know this was TRULY a collaboration and work of love between two dedicated employees, Kailyn & her manager, James. While she didn't have enough tips to cover right then, she was sure she would by end of shift.... her manager took care of the bill after learning about her actions....She left me the words I needed to hear, that I think EVERY MOM needs to hear. Their caring and thoughtfulness did not go unnoticed...my note from Kailyn is now hanging on my fridge, for those moments I need to be reminded of the kindness of strangers... #CrackerBarrel #SuchABlessing #GreatEmployees #FatihInHumanityRestored.'   Read more: Update Your Browser | Facebook Share or comment on this article e-mail 34 shares Most watched News videos Animal lover smashes car window to free a dog dying in the heat Ex-con fashion model Jeremy Meeks gets denied entry to the UK Schoolboy, 14, fends off angry adult using martial arts Unflinching female tram driver smashes into car on the track Former Southampton striker James Beattie rescues children on yacht Aston Villa fans bully and taunt a couple on train Ian Huntley's daughter Sam says he doesn't deserve to be called dad Shocking video shows drug addict writhing around on street Shocking moment over 60 teenage girls brawl in Florida mall Arkansas executes Jack Jones and Marcel Williams on the same day Dramatic moment speed boat crashes into rocks and flips over Dog has to be rescued after getting head stuck in jar KATIE HOPKINS Kim’s ass hasn’t just broken the internet,...

The problem is textile waste and the answer the Fiberizer v.2, a machine that challenges the national problem of textile waste by taking old garments and recycling them into reusable fabric. The team — organized by Prof. Tasha Lewis, fiber science and apparel design — consisted of students from fiber science and apparel design, design and environmental analysis, physics, mechanical and aerospace engineering, and materials science and engineering. “The idea came from a collaboration I had with a company making new clothing from the used clothing exported and sold in Haiti,” Lewis said. “This company upcycled clothing in a local factory and wanted a way to deal with the fabric waste left over after the new garment was made.” Lewis said that the company asked her and her team if they could develop solutions that would help to eliminate the waste by recycling it for another purpose. “It took us a week to get a presentable machine,” said Rayne Milner ’17, a member of the Fiberizer team. “We had to assemble the frame from aluminum and plexiglass, set up motors to control the fiberizing mechanism and the conveyor through a series of pulleys and belts. Assembling the machine so that all the moving parts connected and worked together was very difficult.” The project was funded by a Walmart Foundation U.S. Manufacturing Innovation Fund grant that Lewis secured for the team. Their project specifically targets the small and damaged textile waste that could not be otherwise put to use. So far, the machine has had an extensive array of purposes, creating products for domestic use and for the outdoors. “This project is important because it is redefining how we think about recycling and reusing,” Milner said. “The Fiberizer is really just a re-designed paper shredder, but the excitement and interest surrounding the machine is incredible. It is a great example of the growing interest with sustainable design.” Lewis also established a partnership with Green Eileen, a recycled clothing initiative of Eileen Fisher, Inc., which aims to reduce the textile industry’s environmental impact. Green Eileen donates all the garments used in the Fiberizer project, and in return the team provides the company with fiber samples and end-product recommendations, Lewis said. “For the next steps, we plan to refine the Fiberizer’s operation and capability to make sure it can handle a variety of fabrics,” Lewis said. “We are working to ensure the machine can fiberize all the types of fabrics found in our closets, and this is a huge challenge.” The team will continue to “work out kinks in the design” and make refinements to the current model. “There is hopefully enough interest and money that we may be able to make a third fiberizer and beyond,” Milner said. “The goal is to have many fiberizers available to produce so they could use them in design and eventually use them to process large amounts of material for repurposing.” Click Here to Donate To The Sun We are an independent, student newspaper.

Non-toxic manicures, crystal therapy and hydrating I.V. drips will be on offer at June's "In Goop Health" summit, according to the event site; the location for "In Goop Health" has been chosen but will not be released at this time, a Goop press rep told LAist, prompting us to speculate that it's somewhere super-secret and mystical, like an enchanted cave or the Bermuda Triangle. The summit's panels will feature an array of Goop acolytes, including Girls collaborators Lena Dunham and Jenni Konner, actresses Cameron Diaz and Nicole Richie, fitness trainer Tracy Anderson, fashion designer Tory Burch and "Clean Program" founder Dr. Alejandro Junger. In news that will come as no surprise to anyone who's ever perused Goop's product list, tickets to the convention don't come cheap. Below, LAist has put together a guide to "In Goop Health"'s three-tiered ticket options (each tier is named for a different crystal, by the way), plus some equally-priced ideas for readers who aren't that into crystals and sound baths. "Lapis" ticket, $500: - Access to every panel and keynote - “Wellness activations” like crystal therapy and aura photography - Clean and gourmet food and drinks from brands like Moon Juice and Tropicana Probiotics - A $200 “adult goody bag” of Goop-endorsed products. For $500, you could also: - Buy an actual block of Afghanistan lapis on Ebay - Pay off a whole classroom of kids' school-lunch debts - Fill your pantry with 14 jars of Moon Juice Cordyceps powder - Pay for exactly one-tenth of an all-inclusive spa weekend at Arizona's Canyon Ranch - Ride the L.A. Metro exactly 285 times "Amethyst" ticket, $1000: everything from "Lapis," plus: - A cocktail reception with Gwyneth herself - A foam-roller workout with "body whisperer" Lauren Roxburgh - A mini-version of "The Class" led by founder Taryn Toomey - A $350 "adult goody bag" of Goop-endorsed products For $1000, you could also: - Buy two actual amethysts - Pay for two units toward a Nutritional Sciences degree at the University of Arizona - Provide 10 rural women with access to health education through the German nonprofit URIDU - Buy approximately 72 Walmart foam rollers - Rent the 1998 Robert Redford film The Horse Whisperer on Amazon Prime 333 times (or 60 times in HD) "Clear Quartz" ticket, $1500: - Everything from "Lapis" and "Amethyst," plus: - Private morning sound meditation class with Sara Auster, followed by Gwyneth's breakfast pick [wouldn't it be great if 'Gwyneth's breakfast pick' was a microwavable Jimmy Dean Sausage, Egg & Cheese biscuit?] - Lunch with Gwyneth and select panelists, "curated" by Chef Seamus Mullen - A set of Tumi luggage packed with $500 of Goop-endorsed products, - 3 months of early access to new Goop releases - Valet parking (this one's the kicker) For $1500, you could also: - Buy seven 90mm clear quartz spheres - Fly to to Chaiya, Thailand, to attend one of the Wat Suan Mokkh monastery's famed meditation retreats - Stock your fridge with an approximately three-year supply of microwavable Jimmy Dean Sausage, Egg & Cheese biscuits - Feed approximately 375 people at the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank - Pay your half of the average L.A. rent for a two-bedroom apartment ($2978) - Rent out your very own parking lot in Downtown LA Heads up, Goopies — the $1,500 "Clear Quartz" ticket is already sold out, so don't sleep on the "Lapis" and "Amethyst."

This award also recognizes individuals who make outstanding contributions to their state’s pharmacy association and community. “It’s an honor to receive the Distinguished Young Pharmacist Award for Maine. I’m extremely passionate about the pharmacy profession and feel fortunate to have such a fulfilling job. I’m also proud to be able to teach future pharmacists attending the Husson University School of Pharmacy. Furthermore, it’s a great privilege to provide care to United States Veterans in the spinal cord injury clinic while precepting students at the VA Maine Healthcare System. A career in pharmacy can be very rewarding.” The recipients of the Distinguished Young Pharmacist Award must have completed his or her degree in pharmacy within the past 10 years.

Larson, Ph.D., R.Ph., founding dean of the Husson University School of Pharmacy. “She was recently named president-elect for the Maine Pharmacy Association by her peers. She is a valuable member of our team and is helping to make Husson University a regional leader in integrated pharmacy education.” About Dr. Cassandra Parsons: Dr. Cassandra Parsons, a native of Hermon, Maine, is proud to be a licensed pharmacist in her home state.

Its mission is to create solutions for developing the next generation of skilled talent necessary to drive innovation and economic growth within a global context. The summit is led by STEMconnector,® the leading organization working with industry, higher education, NGOs and the public sector to provide resources and leadership that supports smart STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) investments. This year's theme is short-term STEM talent development strategies and impact on business performance. "We are building off the success of last year's first-ever employer-led annual Global STEM Talent Summit and bringing together major industry partners to address the STEM talent gap that exists in our country—and globally," said Dr. Heidi Kleinbach-Sauter, Senior Vice President, Global R&D, PepsiCo, and Chairwoman of the Global STEM Talent Summit. "We have fully transitioned from STEM theory into action and our industry partners are implementing STEM talent development strategies to deliver sustainable enterprise growth." Several keynotes will present a call to action, such as Jan Geldmacher, President of Sprint Business, in conjunction with "Pepper," the intelligent humanoid robot. Jay Bavisi, CEO, EC-Council, will address why we must upskill STEM talent for the projected 8.1 million global cyber jobs, with two million in the USA alone.  Surya Kant, President, North America, UK and Europe Operations, Tata Consultancy Services, challenged last year's summit participants to work on supporting one million tech jobs for the underserved, and he returns in 2017 to build on the digital fluency priority. "Digital technologies are transforming every industry around the world, including manufacturing, banking, retail, and healthcare. Companies are adopting the forces of cloud and automation to make their enterprise far more agile and responsive, in order to provide superior experiences to their end consumers," says Surya. "In this new world order, companies across almost all sectors need talent with a combination of digital fluency, innovation excellence, and employability skills." Other keynotes include Robert Fraley, Executive Vice President and Chief Technology Officer, Monsanto, and Nina Vaca, Chairman & CEO, Pinnacle Group. Media Moderators include Megan Murphy, Editor, Business Week, Bloomberg, and Angela Greiling Keane, Deputy Technology Editor, Politico. This two-day summit serves as a platform for discussion, sharing best practices in STEM talent development strategies, networking and taking collective action to drive scale and speed in helping to solve the STEM shortfall. Together with 50 strategic partners representing more than six million employees, over $2 trillion in combined revenue, and broad industry segmentation from over 200 delegates, the GSTS will report on progress made as part of a three-year strategic roadmap that aims to drive sustainable impact and deliver tangible solutions to diminish the STEM talent shortfall gap. "As disruption is evident, business leaders are shifting focus to talent investments and engagement in STEM and tackling the latest of new technology and skills required for jobs," says Edie Fraser, Chief Executive Officer of STEMconnector.® "As this GSTS initiative continues, leaders are intent on identifying and proselytizing investments in education proven to strengthen a sustainable, long-term talent pool." "Ensuring a robust and sustainable pipeline of stem talent is key to drive innovation in industries and economies all over the world," said Seema Kumar, Vice President, Innovation, Global Health and Science Policy Communication, Johnson & Johnson. "Great innovative ideas can come from anywhere, and our opportunity is to cultivate a broad base of stem talent that is inclusive and diverse. The future of our economy… and our world… depends on it."

Kombucha has a healthy halo about it as a fermented beverage packed with beneficial bacteria. The leading kombucha brand in America also adds an efficacious dose of GanedenBC30 probiotic strain. One ingredient. Two winners. There’s a reason probiotics are the star of the nutritional market today. Like most functional foods, it helps to have nutritional ingredients integrated into foods and beverage products that already share some benefits—added beta-glucans into oatmeal, for example, or protein into dairy products. Or, as is the case here, probiotics into the naturally probiotic fermented beverage kombucha. Probiotics are an easy fit in almost anything.  The core strategy of Ganeden is to get consumers to consume more probiotics—all without changing their lifestyle habits. “We all know you need to take a probiotic every single day—some days you want a supplement, other days a kombucha, or a cereal or snack or hummus,” says Ganeden president Mike Bush. “We try to not go into inherently unhealthy products, like we won’t go into Swedish Fish. We try to have a good mix of products for consumers.” That means putting probiotics wherever any healthy product meets a shopper. “We went with GanedenBC30,” says Amy Burgess, communications manager at organic, cold-pressed juice maker Suja Juice, “because they have a ton of studies around gut and immune health and we wanted to be able make those claims when talking to people about these new products. And also the strain is able to withstand the HPP process. We wanted to have them not just taste great but also have some functionality behind them.” Claims can be made because of Ganeden’s commitment to published research—the company is up to 25 clinicals on GanedenBC30. If clients formulate with 500 million CFUs of GanedenBC30, they can use an immune health claim, while 1 billion CFUs will net an additional digestive health and protein utilization claim (a dozen of its most recent research studies support the latter). Ganeden’s success is exemplified in the number of finished products that have bought into not just the probiotic story but into the spore-former bacteria story, which features a protective shell that protects the bacteria from the vagaries of food processing conditions like heat and shear. “I’ve been watching probiotics for five or ten years in the supplements industry, and I’m seeing a gradual shift into the spore-forming bacteria. Spore-forming bacteria are the future of probiotics,” says Nick Bitz, N.D., chief science officer at supplement company Youtheory. “They’re really advantageous for several reasons, the main one being that they arrive alive.” Spores are essentially seeds, surrounded by a strong calcium coat, says Bitz. “No matter the manufacturing process you use, they always arrive alive.” At the 2016 Natural Products Expo West, Ganeden showcased 60 new products that launched with the GanedenBC30 probiotic strain. In 2017’s show, Ganeden boasted 125 such products. That’s just from the holiday season through early March. The company is doubling in size every two years, including over 50 percent sales growth last year. A business shift Perhaps the most remarkable thing about Ganeden’s growth is that the company started out as a finished product supplement company selling probiotic capsules, tablets and gummies. Then, in 2006, the company hired Bush as a consultant. At the time, the flagship GanedenBC30 was in its Digestive Advantage and Sustenex SKUs, sold in 65,000 food/drug/mass stores. Bush saw opportunity elsewhere. Despite the appearance of success as a supplement brand, there could be greater opportunity as a licensing business, in particular given the hardy nature of its spore-forming probiotic strain. So the company sold its supplement business in 2011 to Schiff (which later sold it to Reckitt Benckiser). “We had this established team getting pills and tablets out the door every day,” Bush says. “There was this back hallway where me, Joe and Julia were working away.” The trio was doing something completely different from the rest of the company, which was selling nine SKUs into the likes of CVS, Walmart, Safeway and Kroger. Yet there was a problem. “It was a great business, it’s growing, but in order to knock it out of the park we’d have to dedicate $15-20 million to do it how we wanted to,” says Bush. “So we decided that there were other people with greater financial resources to take advantage of the science, brand, and distribution. We didn’t have money to compete in the supplements space. Obviously Reckitt has it, and they’re doing great.” Bush says that Harvard University students wrote a case study on Ganeden and its shift from being a direct consumer model to being a licensing model. The company attained GRAS status in 2007, which led to the first product in food launched in 2008. “It was a slow build until we sold the supplements business and we could focus on just that,” says Bush. “Now we have 31 employees focused solely on the licensing side of the business.” While the company continues to churn out research (roughly four to six new studies each year), it also claims an impressive intellectual property dossier, with 135 issued patents. One such example is an exclusive on using Bacillus coagulans probiotic strains for coffee, tea and cereal. So if you’re a coffee or tea maker and want to put Bacillus coagulans in it, you have to either source Ganeden’s or pay them a royalty fee—an area that is a growing revenue source for the company. The “partner” process Ganeden’s elevator pitch is that they are a company that can help brands innovate in the probiotics space with a shelf-stable strain with solid claims backed by science. “We’re not an ingredient supplier. We sell and license our ingredient,” says Bush. “When we sell to anybody, they get, in the price of the material, a license to use our logo, our relevant IP, our clinical studies. We help with marketing. We’re editing press releases for our customers. We have a full-time graphic designer for mock-up packaging. We have a style guide. We spell out the claims clients can use at certain CFU levels. Then we test all products to make sure they’re doing that.” The more products those companies sell, the more ingredients Ganeden sells. “We’re a partner,” says Bush. Creating opportunities The company continues to innovate. One growing area is with animals. Companion animal food and treat marketers want probiotics. The livestock business, too, is ripe for probiotics. Producers are looking to reduce the amount of antibiotics in their operations, and the wellness claim is attractive.  Other areas come from Ganeden’s research program, which includes the simple yet painstaking concept of tinkering with the Bacillus coagulans bacteria. A five-year effort looked at metabolites produced during the fermentation process that creates GanedenBC30. Normally, the solids are kept, and the liquid is discarded. So the company looked into the liquid and discovered lactic acid and other metabolic byproducts, which can have effects on wrinkles and fine lines when used topically. The branded ingredient, Bonicel, was born. A more recent discovery, four years in the making, came from examining the cellular composition of the strain. The immune-health benefit of the probiotic comes from the cell walls of the bacteria. The advantage here is that “inactivated” cells not only still confer a health benefit (though they are not technically a probiotic) but can now be used in shelf-stable beverages and for products that need no refrigeration. “We had a very soft launch at Expo West this year,” says Bush, “and the interest was crazy high.” The branded ingredient, Staimune, was born. Ganeden is a company doing more than riding the probiotic wave.  It is shaping that wave, thanks to its hardy bacterial strain that gives it entrée to products run-of-the-mill strains can’t cope with. It also helps that the company is dedicated to a continuous research effort that continues to open up new product and claims opportunities. Its IP dossier is formidable, and that also contributes to growth. But while all these things add up to success, the biggest contributor may well be the one item that can’t be quantified on a P&L statement for an ingredient company: vision. “We’ve always started with the end consumer and worked our way back, rather than thinking B2B first,” says Bush. “Our primary objective is always efficacious doses in whatever products we sell to.”   From Nutrition Business Journal's 2017 Awards issue.

(Cuyahoga County Jail) Print Email Adam Ferrise, cleveland.com By Adam Ferrise, cleveland.com The Plain Dealer Email the author | Follow on Twitter on April 25, 2017 at 4:38 PM, updated April 25, 2017 at 4:43 PM comments CLEVELAND, Ohio -- A strip club patron, a worker at the popular Mexican restaurant Barrio, a couple on a date and a man returning home from a party will all testify against the suspected Heartless Felons charged in a two-month armed-robbery spree in Cleveland's trendy Tremont neighborhood. The five will testify against Antwoine "Ballzy" Palmer, 24, and Kenneth Jackson Jr., 20 whose trial began Tuesday in U.S. Northern District Court in Cleveland.  Palmer, who faces an unrelated aggravated murder charge in a 2015 shooting, pleaded guilty before the trial began on Tuesday to a charge of possessing a weapon as a felon. He will be sentenced on that conviction following the trial. He is still fighting the carjacking charges. Jackson also pleaded not guilty.  Palmer and Jackson were part of a group that became known as the Tremont Carjackers, which carried out brazen and violent robberies set Tremont on edge in the summer of 2015, according to police and prosecutors. Assistant U.S. Attorney Kelly Galvin said during her opening statement that Palmer masterminded the carjackings. Palmer was a higher-ranking member of the Heartless Felons' Broadway sect, Galvin said. He ordered the carjackings because he needed a new car after he and another man used his old car in a drive-by shooting against a member of the rival Heartless Felons' Fleet sect, Galvin said. Palmer didn't commit the carjackings himself because of his facial tattoos that he knew potential victims would easily remember, Galvin said. "He knew he had to be insulated," she said. "He planned it that way. He strategized it that way." All four carjackings happened between June and August 2015. In three cases, the victims were pistol-whipped, she said. The group chose Tremont because of the high-volume of street parking, Galvin said. Galvin said prosecutors found DNA and fingerprints in the cars connecting Palmer and Jackson to the robberies. Palmer's cellphone put him in Tremont on Aug. 12 at the same time as one of the carjackings. Palmer also had photos of one of the stolen cars on his phone, Galvin said. Investigators also have surveillance video of Palmer, Jackson and two others from a Bedford Walmart where they used one of the carjacking victim's credit card, prosecutors said. Prosecutors will also rely on the testimony of two co-defendants -- Tervon'tae Taylor and Calvin Rembert. Both previously pleaded guilty to carjacking charges and will be sentenced after the trial. Galvin said that they were offered the plea deal in exchange for their testimony. A third defendant-- D'wan Dillard Jr.-- also pleaded guilty but is not expected to testify.  Defense attorneys for both Palmer and Jackson argued that Rembert's and Taylor's testimony will be tainted by deals that will likely include lesser sentences and because both repeatedly lied to the police and FBI. Palmer's attorney, Jaime Serrat, said Taylor changed his story at least six times during several interviews with investigators. "He's lied to the police, the FBI, the U.S. attorneys, he lied under oath to this judge and he's going to lie to you under oath," Serrat said during his opening statement. Kevin Cafferkey, who represents Jackson, said the victims in the case have hazy memories because of the violent and surprising nature of the crimes. In two cases, they picked Jackson out of a photo line-up but misidentified a second carjacker. One picked out a photo of a man who was more than 400 miles away in Connecticut at the time of the carjacking, Cafferkey noted. Cafferkey also accused Cleveland Mayor Frank Jackson of pressuring the police department to make speedy arrests in the case because they occurred in one of Cleveland's premier neighborhoods. "Mayor Jackson put a ton of pressure on the chief of police, his commanders and detectives," Cafferkey said. "They rushed to stop these from happening and they rushed to judgment."

To do so, it is making investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy. IBM isn’t alone. In fact, nearly half the companies in the Fortune 500 have set targets to cut their greenhouse gas emissions, improve energy efficiencies and up their consumption of renewable energy, says the just-released Power Forward 3.0 report. And as the cost of the technologies and the fuels drop, companies are striving to do more and more. Ceres, the World Wildlife Fund, CDP and Calvert Investments contributed to the report.  As for IBM, it is designing, building and operating its data centers and manufacturing facilities in a way that optimizes energy and material use while at the at the same time, limiting its greenhouse gas emissions. Using more renewable energy is also key to its strategy.  And it has kept its eye on the ball: In 2015, IBM set a goal of cutting its greenhouse gas emissions from energy consumption by 35% from 2005 levels by 2020. In the same year, it raised its renewable energy targets from 16% to 20%, all by 2020. “IBM’s longstanding commitment to energy conservation delivers improved operational efficiency, reduced GHG emissions, and cost savings,” says the Power Forward report. “In addition, IBM greatly extends the influence of its activities by translating approaches from its internal operations into solutions that help clients achieve greater energy efficiency,” the report adds. “IBM also requires global suppliers to implement an environmental management system that includes inventorying and reducing their energy use and related GHG emissions.” The Fortune 100 companies are leading the trend, the report says, with 63% of those companies setting goals. Still, the smallest 100 companies in the Fortune 500 are doing a lot as well, it adds, noting that 44% have such targets. That’s up from 19% in 2013. Consumer staples such as food and beverage companies are the highest achievers while oil and gas companies are at the bottom of the list. “Meanwhile, businesses are reaping bigger and bigger cost savings from energy efficiency projects they have implemented to meet their targets, with 190 companies collectively reporting $3.7 billion in annual savings,” says the report. The most significant trend is that companies are setting science-based targets as well as trying to run their operations using just renewables. About 24 companies aim to operate their facilities using solely green energy and include Facebook, Google and Microsoft as well as Walmart and Bank of America, the report says. Companies can either buy renewable power in the form of power purchase agreements, invest directly in those projects or own and operate them outright. A science-based target, the organizations say, is when a company sets its personal goals in line with the best-available science, all to limit global temperature increases to less than 2 degrees Celsius from the pre-industrial era. As of January 2017, 210 companies are using such a standard to set their greenhouse gas goals. They include Proctor & Gamble, General Mills and Kellogg Company.  The organizations have some advice for companies, investors and the electricity sector. It is suggesting to companies to help create economies of scale within the renewable energy sector by joining alliances and to strike while the iron is hot, buying such power before the federal tax credits expire in a few years. At the same time, it is telling those businesses to support initiatives at the state level and to report their progress in achieving greenhouse gas reductions. As for investors, they should disclose their investment portfolios to illustrate that they are promoting the development companies with sustainable agendas. To that end, the organizations are also suggesting that those investors work with the companies in which they hold an interest to limit their carbon footprints. And finally, the organizations say that utilities need to offer ever-larger shares of renewable to their corporate customers. “We’ve been tracking and reducing emissions since 2007, and we’ve been operating our data centers and the rest of the company at 100 percent carbon neutrality since 2012,” Brad Smith, chief legal officer for Microsoft said in the report. “We’ve achieved this progress by driving efficiencies, charging our business units a fee on carbon, and investing in sustainable energy projects and technologies.” Categories Air, Clean Energy, FeatureTags ceres, Facebook, General Mills, Google, IBM, Kellogg, Microsoft, Proctor & Gamble, Walmart Leveraging EHS Software in Support of Culture Changes Sponsored By: VelocityEHS    Video: Expense & Data Management for Complex Payables Sponsored By: Ecova, Inc.    Choosing the Correct Emission Control Technology Sponsored By: Anguil Environmental Systems    Four Key Questions to Ask Before Your Next Energy Purchase Sponsored By: EnerNOC, Inc.    Leave a Comment Cancel reply NEWSLETTER NEWSLETTER SIGNUP Join 100,000+ subscribers who gain a competitive advantage with our news and analysis.

Metal objects like theses colorful roosters, at right, are also among the treasures to be found at the Zillah drive flea market. By Julia Hart By Julia Hart Thousands of items — both newly flipped and vintage finds — are included under the canopies of the “No Rhyme or Reason Flea Market,” which will be open the next two weekends. ZILLAH  New tourist attractions are popping up around the Lower Yakima Valley that may at first seem like ‘just another flea market.” The rebirth of flea markets has a whole new look here, thanks to events like the Bloomerang in Sunnyside in mid-September and the Sunnyside Lions 16th Street Community Flea Market in early August. But organizers of the “No Rhyme or Reason Flea Market” this past weekend believe there is room for one more such event to lure thousands of tourists to the Lower Yakima Valley. The two-day event attracted more than 45 vendors and thousands of shoppers to Don and Edie Allan’s farm on 2060 East Zillah Drive. The vendors offered everything from handmade yard furniture to specialty items like Scentsy non-flame candles and kettle corn. There were also food vendors who helped keep market-goers on-site for a bit longer. Market creative designer Shelleigh Goodwin said she and her step-mother, Edie Allan, began in February to advertise and search for vendors to fill the more than 4 acres with specialty items from jewelry to one-of-a-kind shabby chic items and primitive arts and crafts “We wanted to offer an event that shoppers of all kinds would enjoy,” Goodwin said. Goodwin, who specializes in creating yard and garden art, said the flea market proved to be a huge success. “We will be open again Saturday and Sunday for the pre-spring barrel events in the valley.” “And, we’ll be open on the official Spring Barrel Weekend, April 28-30,” said Edie Allan, who handled the antique and vintage collectibles side of the market. Allan also operates this Old House Antiques at the farm. Goodwin, who works as a retail representative for Walmart, said she hopes to open her own country garden design shop at the farm. Goodwin said they were encouraged by area winery staffs to be open more than just one weekend. “We’ll believe we can find more customers from among the winery visitors looking to extend their visit to wine country,” she said. “After all, we are in the middle of the Rattlesnake Wine Trail,” Goodwin said.

Snapp will report to NCM President Cliff Marks and lead what the company calls a “newly formed digital products team focused on delivering innovative consumer experiences and new ways for brands to connect with movie audiences.” At Microsoft, Snapp created and built its direct retail channel for business customers.

And their ideas came pretty close to what emerged in other locations across the country more than two decades later. Granite Geek David Brooks covered this group in Keene when they first won a design contest in the early 1990s and he’s revisiting the idea now in his column this week in The Concord Monitor. He spoke with NHPR’s Peter Biello. Listen Listening... / 5:46 Granite Geek David Brooks speaks with NHPR's Peter Biello. What did this group come up with back in the early 90s? This was a contest prodded by California, which had zero-emission standards. Massachusetts had some as well, and it was obvious to a lot of people back then that vehicles with no tailpipe emissions would have to exist to make that happen. This was almost a quarter century ago. Back then, electric vehicles didn’t exist. There were a few demonstration models full of lead-acid batteries. But people realized that, if yo’re going to have electric vehicles, you need infrastructure. So this contest was about designing infrastructure. So the folks in Keene entered in the “Small City” category and they looked at what would be necessary in Keene. And what did they think was necessary? They thought that batteries were the bottleneck, even moreso back then. The range anxiety and concerns of an electric vehicle would have to be met, but they also realized the big benefit. Unlike gasoline or diesel cars, you have options for how to fuel electric vehicles. I have to go to the gas station now. That’s my only choice. But with an electric car, I have multiple choices. So they set up what they called “parallel activities”—ways you can charge during different activities in life. There’s the home charge. Then there’s the medium level charges, which are the most interesting, and then the large-scale chargers, envisioned as a multi-fuel station, where you could get gas or electrons to put in your electric car. And they designed it—really nice stuff they did—put it down Route 9 and, you know, home chargers, and then all the ones for the downtown. And how close did this idea come to the reality that we see in some locations today? One thing about this is that they said all this would happen by 2005. Not quite. Didn’t quite make it. And they said that if this happened, roughly 15 percent of the cars on the road would be electric. That’s off by an order of magnitude. This wasn’t a prediction, but they did say that, within these parameters, this could happen. This has mostly not happened, with one exception. When you drive around, you see almost no public charging stations. You don’t pull into a gas station to see an electric option. People who have bought electric cars, usually a Leaf or a Tesla, will have some sort of charging at home. So that aspect has happened. But the intermediate ones—there’s a few, for example, hotels, a few restaurants that have some electric charging that you can do while you’re there, eating, but not much. But that middle level was most interesting. Middle level being… Being: going downtown, how can you charge up your car while you’re shopping, and how can you use this to revitalize downtown. Remember, this was the early 1990s, when what they called the “Walmart Juggernaut” was helping to kill downtowns, so they saw this as a way to bring people back downtown. They designed several clever options, including putting them on inertial reels up high on streetlights, so when you pull into your parking spot on the street, you can just pull the reel down and plug in your car and charge right there. Keene also has some funky little alleyways and they designed what I think of as down in Texas, the “Brew Thrus” where you drive through and get beer. In this case, you’d get electricity in this covered alleyway. It would be charged up and driven out when you’re done shopping. So they had a number of options like that and developed a logo. A consistent look would help people identify these electric charging stations. You mention that there’s a chicken and egg situation that drives the dollars and cents behind electric cars. Which comes first? The cars, or the infrastructure to support the cars? That’s why the only thing that exists is from Tesla. Tesla has done the latter. They’ve managed to convince these venture capitalists to give them bazillions of dollars, so they said they’d just build the infrastructure and that will cause people to buy Teslas. That’s why the only places you can get these multi-fuel stations they envisioned nearly 25 years ago is by the Hooksett welcome center. You can get your gas and see six Tesla charging stations. Trouble is, those are only for Teslas. They won’t work for your Leaf or the Chevy Bolt, which is a really interesting electric car coming out. So nobody else has done this yet. Nobody else has decided to cough up all the bucks to solve that chicken and egg problem. So that’s a real obstacle.

Ware   |   April 25, 2017 at 2:46 PM Follow @upi Comments | License Photo April 25 (UPI) -- More than a dozen people face federal charges stemming from what authorities called a "chop shop" in South Dakota that trafficked bald eagles and dozens of other bird species, the U.S. Department of Justice said Tuesday. An indictment unsealed Monday revealed charges against 15 people that vary from conspiracy to unspecified violations of three federal wildlife laws. According to prosecutors, the accused participated in a network that illegally possessed bald eagles -- the national bird and animal of the United States -- and 39 other species and sold parts, such as feathers, for profit. The defendants are accused of committing the various violations in South Dakota in 2015 and 2016. A minimum of 200 birds -- and 100 bald and golden eagles -- were killed, usually shot, dismembered and then trafficked by the suspects, officials said. Sellers and buyers coordinated the transactions online and at various locations in western South Dakota. "As with any black market, there's a wide variety of prices depending on what the buyer and seller can negotiate and the specific species," U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Assistant Special Agent-in-charge Dan Rolince said. "For instance, golden eagles bring a larger price than bald eagles. So, to put as an exact price is not possible. But in general terms, a whole eagle carcass would be sold for $1,000 to $1,200." Among the items sold were a golden eagle head for $250 and two pairs of eagle wings for $900, officials said. Six of the 15 charged in Monday's indictment, who prosecutors believe were the main operators, face a charge of conspiracy to commit wildlife trafficking. One, Troy Fairbanks, owns Buffalo Dreamers, a Rapid City-based Native American Lakota dance company -- which prominently features the bald eagle throughout its website. "These [birds] were treated like garbage. They were in Walmart bags. They were in garbage bags. They were spread out all over the house," U.S. Attorney Randolph J. Seiler said at a news conference Tuesday. "There was blood in vehicles, blood in trunks and no effort whatsoever to afford the eagle or the eagle part any sense of tradition or culture or any aspect of spirituality with respect to how they were handled." Other protected birds were also trafficked, according to investigators who spent two years on the case, called Project Dakota Flyer. Thirteen of the 15 defendants face charges of violating at least two of three federal wildlife laws -- the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act (1940), the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (1918), and the Lacey Act (1900). The first law was enacted to protect bald eagles and says a person cannot "take, possess, sell, purchase, barter, offer to sell, purchase or barter, transport, export or import, at any time or any manner, any bald eagle ... alive or dead, or any part, nest, or egg thereof." It was amended by President John Kennedy in 1962 to include the golden eagle. RECOMMENDEDThousands of birds slaughtered in South Korea avian flu outbreak The Migratory Bird Treaty Act extends similar protections to certain migratory birds -- including the barn owl, American black vulture, common nighthawk, red-tailed hawk, American crow and Canada goose. The Lacey Act bars unlawful trafficking of wildlife, fish and plants that have been illegally taken, possessed, transported, or sold. Charged in the indictment are: Troy Fairbanks, 54; Majestic Fairbanks, 22; Troy Young Fairbanks, 24; Alvin Brown, Jr., 37; Michael Primeaux, 32; Juan Mesteth, 39; Aaron David West, 62; Aaron David West, Jr., 33; Jorge Pena, 44; Valencia Neck, 38; Benjamin Iron Hawk, 44; Chet Christensen, 66; Ronald Fisher, 64; Gary Fisher, 69; David Jasper, 60. Authorities said more charges are expected in the case. Initial court appearances for the defendants of Monday's indictment are scheduled for next month in Rapid City and Pierre.

Kearney weigh in on the topic. By Jim Singer and Johan Gott on April 25, 2017 Share This Article Reddit LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Print Talk Chinese President Xi Jinping (left) and U.S. President Donald Trump (right) Business abhors uncertainty. But uncertainty has been the organizing principle of the Trump administration’s approach to global trade policy, leaving every American business with an offshore supply chain scrambling for clarity and options. The financial survival of thousands of retailers is dependent on two factors: which set of conditions emerges, and how effectively they react. In a trade environment that threatens to penalize large U.S. importers, especially retailers in certain categories such as electronics and apparel, the question is not how to avoid risk, but rather how to be better prepared than your competitors to respond to whatever policy scenario emerges once the rhetoric and “tweet storm” settles. Here, we focus on three plausible trade scenarios: the imposition of a Border Adjustment Tax (BAT); what happens if NAFTA is dismantled, and the possibility of trade conflict with China. BAT A Border Adjustment Tax is included in the Paul Ryan-Kevin Brady plan, a Congressional blueprint for corporate tax reform advocating a reduction of the corporate tax rate from today’s 35 percent to 20 percent. Under a BAT, companies would be taxed on revenues generated in the United States less cost of goods sold, provided, of course, those goods were not imported, in which case their costs couldn’t be deducted. Exporters could keep all profits from goods sold outside the United States. This nets out as an effective 20 percent, across-the-board, tax on all imports. While they provide localized services, retailers buy goods from diverse locations — often overseas. Because they rarely export, a BAT would hit retailers especially hard, raising the costs of many goods by 20 percent. Even more troubling, that impact doesn’t show up at the border, but rather in the company profit-and-loss statement, potentially destabilizing retailers with thin margins or high imports. BAT proponents argue that resulting exchange-rate moves will compensate for the increased costs of imports. If that doesn’t happen immediately, retailers with significant imports would face considerable financial risk. NAFTA During his campaign, candidate Trump described NAFTA as “the single worst trade deal ever signed anywhere.” We don’t know how that translates in terms of policy but, at a minimum, the administration will likely seek to renegotiate the treaty — assuming they don’t tear it up altogether. Since NAFTA took effect, Mexico has enjoyed tariff-free access to the United States, and in 2016 exported $24 billion worth of food and beverages such as vegetables, fruits and juices; $28 billion of household durable goods like TVs, refrigerators, and cell phones, and $8 billion of household nondurables like apparel to American retail shelves. Under a benign NAFTA scenario, the U.S. and Mexico might agree to modifications, like those previously agreed to during Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations — primarily in areas like environmental standards on overfishing, needed updates to e-commerce and digital trade, and rules of origin regulations that are important to the auto industry. While certain labor standards updates may raise costs, specifically in areas like apparel, these reforms wouldn’t cripple U.S. retailers. In a disruptive NAFTA scenario, American and Mexican negotiators would be unable to agree to a deal. The U.S. Congress must ratify any changes to NAFTA, but President Trump can terminate it with a stroke of his pen — an Amerexit, to borrow a phrase — and tariffs would return to pre-1994 levels. China China is the other target of the Trump administration’s ire. The most extreme Chinese trade policy proposal involves imposing a 45 percent tariff across the board. This would profoundly impact retailers, specifically in the apparel and electronics categories. Chinese exports account for 20 percent of U.S. household spending on furniture and household goods categories; for clothing and shoes, the rate reaches 36 percent. The math is simple. Retailers would have to either absorb massive increases, killing their margins in the process, or pass those increases on to consumers. China would retaliate, likely by imposing counter-tariffs on American exports. The recent closure of South Korean department store operator Lotte’s Chinese outlets by Chinese authorities — a way of showing China’s displeasure over American missile deployments in South Korea — suggests yet another plausible response. American retailers might suffer Lotte’s fate in the event of U.S.-China confrontation, either economic or political. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. is a prominent example of an American retailer in China, alongside outlets for iconic American brands like Apple and Nike. As these scenarios suggest, retailers face risks and certain categories of retailers are unevenly impacted. What unites them all is the need to understand their risk exposure to trade disruption and an imperative to develop plans to address those risks. In the words of GE chief executive officer Jeff Immelt, there are two ways to succeed: “One is when everything’s perfect. And the other one is when everything’s in chaos, but you’re better than everybody else.” A number of optional responses exist for retailers and other importers, each requiring detailed thought and analysis. Absorbing costs will be difficult for most retailers given thin margins in many categories, so costs may have to be passed on to consumers. Importers face a number of issues, including: determining cost impacts under different scenarios; assessing real price elasticity in their category; thinking through competitive response; calculating currency implications; considering how retaliation by other nations may affect export markets. On the supply side, assessing alternative location options – including serious consideration of re-shoring to the U.S. – requires understanding the necessary investments, cost differences between countries, technological and demand capacity, and what happens to prices if large demand volume moves to a new set of suppliers in a short time frame. These responses must be framed against wider considerations such as whether these policies are being used as short-term negotiation tactics or reflect a longer shift toward a more protectionist age. While future success can’t be ensured, war-gaming potential responses helps companies develop strategic blueprints and the flexibility of thinking needed to address whatever the future of trade may bring. Furthermore, it gives them first mover advantage over their competition. Jim Singer is a partner and board of directors member at management consulting firm A.T. Kearney.

If anything, there would be hiring.  KL Outdoor currently employs about 300 fulltime workers, and about 200 part-time workers during its busy time from January-July, he said.  Harris was unsure of the administrative structure moving forward, or whether there would be a new name for the combined company.  "There will be consolidation of processes and sharing of best practices," he said. "We make a different type of kayak than they do, so we weren't real strong competitors. ... We think it will be a good match there. ... We thought it would be a great way for us to team up, and be a better asset for our customers."  The companies are offering their combined product portfolios and manufacturing capacity to customers.   "Our two companies are a natural fit, with products and areas of expertise that complement one another and provide a tremendous opportunity to expand into new product lines in the rapidly growing outdoor water sports market," said Robert Farber, GSC president, in the release.  Both firms were owned by Boca Raton-based New Water Capital, which recently made "significant investments" in both companies. New Water purchased a large share of KL Outdoor at the end of 2016. An investment of $1.4 million in a new building and machinery allowed the KL Outdoor to move warehousing to a facility at 1224 E. Pontaluna Road in Norton Shores, making room for additional manufacturing equipment at its existing factories. Plans were approved by the city of Norton Shores in fall 2016.

Those are just some of the striking details about Dave, a Los Angeles startup with a chummy name that launched its app Tuesday. The company — which has raised $3 million from the billionaire Mark Cuban and other investors — will fund its own advances instead of using a bank partner, and its income will rely on $1 monthly user fees (they start after the first month of use) and voluntary donations. However, the mission of the app underscores a growing trend among banks and fintech startups alike: attempt to ease cash flow challenges at a time when almost half of consumers say they could not afford a $400 emergency expense or would cover the expense by selling something or borrowing money. Instead of predicting what consumers can save, like Digit does or what consumers can spend, like BBVA’s Simple does, Dave is crunching transaction data, including upcoming bills, to predict when bank customers will encounter low balances within the next seven days and offering them one remedy — advancing up to $250 to their linked accounts. When users are paid, the app will automatically grab money owed from their accounts if they agree to it. But users can also pay the startup back manually. And new advances are barred before the previous one is paid, company officials say. Such services typically raise privacy issues. Dave’s privacy policy says consumers may limit sharing of personal information for joint marketing with other financial companies and for affiliates and nonaffiliates to market to its customers, but they may not block marketing directly from Dave or sharing with affiliates or credit bureaus for everyday business purposes. Jason Wilk, Dave’s chief executive and co-founder, sees the service as a way to avoid overdraft fees — something he still believes requires solutions despite reforms made in recent years and banks' offering alternative accounts. “The problem isn’t getting any better,” Wilk said. Although it’s hard to quantify the revenue all banks make on overdraft fees, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau estimates banks with $1 billion or more in assets totaled $11.42 billion on overdraft and nonsufficient-funds fees in 2016 (the second year banks with $1 billion or more had to make the data publicly available). The agency estimates that consumer overdraft and NSF fee revenues total as much as $17 billion annually. And sure, banks are required to get consumers to opt in to overdraft fees; however, data from the Pew Charitable Trusts shows that more than half of consumers who received a debit card overdraft penalty fee do not recall opting in to overdraft coverage. “The vast majority of people who overdraft appear to do it by accident or unintentionally,” said Nick Bourke, director of consumer finance at the Pew Charitable Trusts. According to a survey Dave conducted in March, consumers cited “forgotten bills” and “I come up short before my payday” as top reasons why they were dinged with overdraft fees. And as Wilk sees it, there is also a segment of consumers who do not opt in to overdraft protection because they are either unaware or want to avoid using overdraft as an expensive form of credit. For all of these consumers, Dave is meant to be a cheaper alternative for times when bills are due, balances are low and payday is still a ways off. Besides the monthly $1 fee, there are no interest charges, but Dave asks users to make an optional donation at a time when most overdraft fees are around $34 a pop. “Our current mission is to enhance existing checking accounts with Dave's technology,” Wilk said. Regardless of whether Dave lives up to its goal of an overdraft fee remedy, there is no question that consumers struggle with juggling income swings and expenses. “It’s not a niche issue,” said John Thompson, senior vice president of the Center for Financial Services Innovation. “Spikes and dips and expenses and lack of correlation between [them] put households in situations where they have to scramble to cover those gaps.” Dave is but the latest to launch a service designed to rethink the payday cycle to bridge gaps between payday and money owed. Some, like FlexWage, are positioning their services as an employee benefit. Others, like Activehours and Even, are direct-to-consumer like Dave. The name-your-fee model is atypical in finance with a few exceptions. Activehours and the startup Aspiration still ask for tips as part of their revenue models. Green Dot’s original GoBank model also requested tips from users, but the name-your-price model was dropped when Walmart announced it would distribute the mobile checking account. Like the others, Dave is up against many challenges, including courting consumers. In Dave’s case, it could be harder to engage consumers with something that could be considered depressing: low-balance predictions. Wilk casts Dave’s service as a positive experience. “We are saving people from a very negative" outcome, Wilk said. As Pew’s Bourke sees it, a paycheck is somewhat of a forced savings device and the jury is still out on whether advances ahead of paychecks actually help someone more than they harm them. Consumers need to be able to pay small-dollar credit over time so as to avoid a cycle of dependency, Bourke says. Granted, Dave users do not have to advance a portion of their paychecks. The forecasting feature, after all, is designed to get people thinking about ways to avoid the outcome. However, forecasting transactions is almost as controversial as offering small lines of credit. Some see forecasting transactions as being more useful than personal financial management services that show things that have already happened. But others see predicting transactions as potentially confusing to consumers and possibly dangerous if it deepens their debt. Certainly, Wilk is in the camp that believes forecasting transactions will help consumers. As he sees it, apps need to crunch the financial data they have to help consumers better understand their available balance before it is too late to prevent a negative outcome. Dave will also let users pause the predictions as well as alert the app when something is inaccurate. Regardless of whether Dave flames out or endures, the app’s emergence points to a blending of products that some believe will increasingly gain importance in banking. “It’s different than it used to be,” Thompson said. Dave "represents an opportunity to solve problems consumers have as opposed to just asking them to solve them on their own.” Article Your Top CECL Questions Answered How should banks approach CECL implementation and can existing processes be used as a starting point?

Follow @sbanjo Facebook Twitter Email Print Share April 25, 2017 12:11 PM EDT WHOLE FOODS MARKET INC -0.40 At Closing, April 25th 36.06 USD The "Whole Paycheck" moniker applies to more than just the steep prices at Whole Foods Market Inc. It's also the biggest roadblock for an Albertsons Cos. buyout.  The closely held U.S. supermarket chain is reportedly exploring a takeover of Whole Foods, perhaps because a would-be deal for rival Sprouts Farmers Market Inc. has been shelved. Hoping for a Deal Whole Foods Market's shares are trading roughly 20 percent higher than the $30 average price target from analysts, partly due to hopes of a takeover Source: Bloomberg A buyout by Albertsons would provide a sense of deja vu for Jana Partners LLC, the activist that earlier this month disclosed an 8.8 percent stake in Whole Foods and played a role in the 2014 sale of Safeway Inc. to Albertsons. This time, though, it won't be as easy as just bolting on a similar-sized grocery chain to take advantage of economies of scale.  For one, swallowing Whole Foods, with a market value of almost $12 billion, would require Albertsons to add as much as $7 billion in new debt to roughly $13 billion in existing borrowings. That's a risky prospect considering the grocery industry's razor-thin margins, the potential for market-share loss and the prospect of rising rates. What's more, bond and loan investors are likely to demand higher rates than they would for a buyout target in a less-challenged sector as Whole Foods' sales sag amid heightened competition. And Cerberus Capital Management and other Albertsons investors would need to cobble together an equity check of $4.5 billion or more, a feat we've only seen once in the past four years.   In a Drought Only a handful of leveraged buyouts over $10 billion have occurred since the financial crisis Source: Bloomberg A merger between Whole Foods and Alberstons would certainly be easier if the latter was publicly traded, but Albertsons scrapped its IPO in October 2015, citing market volatility. One workaround would be to structure the deal as a so-called reverse merger, where the joint company would assume Whole Foods' publicly traded status. It would be tough, though, for Albertsons and Whole Foods to agree on an ownership ratio in the combined company that both view as fair, especially before any integration has taken place. And entering into the public eye would make it harder to execute on far-reaching cost-saving measures and other operational improvements from the merger, given the distraction of quarterly earnings. If an Albertsons' bid doesn't materialize, Whole Foods could catch the eye of non-buyout acquirers (Amazon previously pondered a deal and passed, according to Bloomberg News).  But even for logical parties like Kroger Co., the behemoth chain that was one of three grocery retailers to bid for Whole Foods competitor Fresh Market Inc., hurdles remain. An all-cash transaction at a slight premium would almost double Kroger's adjusted debt-to-Ebitda ratio from its most recently reported level of 2.3, while a cash-and-stock transaction would be dilutive to existing shareholders unless significant synergies can be achieved.   Whole Foods' best bet is to start cracking on an internal repair job. It has to stop wasting its energies engaging in price wars or building more stores, and start focusing on what it's customers want -- new and different products they can't find at their neighborhood grocer. Fresh fish and quality produce are actually getting harder to come by in the large quantities and prices Wal-Mart Stores Inc. or Kroger want, and Whole Foods already has the supplier relationships and customer trust to fill those needs.  Check, Please After growing sales for 23 straight quarters, Whole Foods has posted six consecutive quarters of comparable-store sales declines Source: Bloomberg Behind the scenes, Whole Foods can take steps such as revamping its supply chain and back-end technology to reduce costs and make it easier for customers to shop there. Continuing to add more prepared foods, meal kits, restaurants, and other experience-heavy offerings could help boost traffic.  Adding new board members and other management changes, which Jana agitated for earlier this month, is a good start in accelerating a much-needed turnaround at the organic grocer -- and that could have more lasting benefits for shareholders than they'd get from a onetime takeover payout. This just might be an instance where Whole Foods' high price -- by keeping suitors away -- could work in its favor. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners. To be sure, this isn't impossible due to the fact that other private equity funds, sovereign wealth funds and pension funds are flush with cash. This is certainly possible: Credit Suisse Group AG reckons synergies from a Kroger-Whole Foods deal could reach 3 percent of the natural grocer's sales, or roughly $470 million based on fiscal 2016 figures.  To contact the authors of this story: Gillian Tan in New York at gtan129@bloomberg.net Shelly Banjo in New York at sbanjo@bloomberg.net To contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.net A Series of Fortunate Events A Series of Fortunate Events Markets loved the news of a tie-up between Netflix and Baidu's iQiyi Source: Bloomberg Chinese adventure Tune In for This Netflix Original Entertainment Tim Culpan In the Red In the Red Toshiba's losses have been deepening Source: Bloomberg Seed Sowing Toshiba's Little Sale With Big Promise Deals Nisha Gopalan Wells Fargo Directors Who Survived 15/15 Narrow Margin Wells Fargo's Board Can't Relax Yet Finance Gillian Tan Lovin' It Lovin' It McDonald's shares have outperformed the S&P 500 over the last few years Source: Bloomberg Keep It Simple, Stupid McDonald's Shows Cheap Beats Hip Consumer Shelly Banjo Money Owed on Junk-Rated Tech Debt in 2021 $39 billion Drop Like a Shop Retailers Foreshadow Tech Debt Carnage Tech Shira Ovide Decline in Venezuela's Oil Consumption Per Capita, 2013-15 19% Both Sides Venezuela's Complicated Crisis For Oil Energy Liam Denning The Unkindest Cut Express Scripts' Anthem Loss Goes Deeper Than Numbers Health Max Nisen Building Faith Building Faith Analysts' EPS estimates for the first quarter have recovered somewhat since plunging on the back of Arconic's disappointing fourth-quarter results Source: Bloomberg Proxy Fight Arconic's Fighting Words Necessitate Vote Brooke Sutherland Faith Healer Faith Healer Investors have warmed to Fresenius's M&A activity Source: Bloomberg This looks similar Fresenius Spends Billions On a Falling Akorn Chris Hughes Priced for Perfection Priced for Perfection Mining and construction equipment valuations look quite stretched Source: Bloomberg Dump Those Worries Diggers Finally Feel the Earth Move Industrials Chris Bryant Bling It On Bling It On Luxury goods valuations have risen over the past six months on recovery in China Source: Bloomberg New Look for Arnault This Little Dior Number Is Yours for $13 Billion Consumer Andrea Felsted Coming Home Coming Home Home Depot's shares have outperformed the S&P 500 in recent years as it focused on e-commerce and its supply chain, rather than building more stores Source: Bloomberg Floor & Decor Plan Are We Wrong About Brick-and-Mortar Retail?
