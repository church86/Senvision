On October 6 and 7, 2016, Orlando Sentinel reporters and photographers covered Hurricane Matthew's impact on Central Florida with the goal of keeping locals and visitors alike safe and informed with all the current storm information. Kyle ArnoldContact ReporterOrlando Sentinel Hurricane Matthew: Stores run out of essential foods, gas as storm approaches Water, bread and other emergency preparation essentials are running low at many area supermarkets as people get ready for Hurricane Matthew. Wal-Mart and Publix stores throughout the region Wednesday were down to the last varieties of bread, water had disappeared from store shelves, and canned food was going fast. Publix, Winn-Dixie and Wal-Mart are all bringing extra trucks to accommodate the rush demand, which is only expected to increase as Hurricane Matthew makes its anticipated pass by Central Florida early Friday. Some gas stations ran out of fuel and had a tough time keeping up with anxious drivers topping off vehicles. "It looks like there have been shortages at a few stations, but it's not because of an overall supply problem. Some stations are just getting a lot of demand all at once," AAA spokesman Mark Jenkins said. PICTURE GALLERY: Check out photos of Hurricane Matthew as the storm affects Orlando and the rest of Central Florida. A spokeswoman for RaceTrac confirmed that. "A few stations have run out of gas here and there, but it's not a widespread thing. We are getting stations refueled pretty quickly," said Karissa Bursch at RaceTrac. Trucks were resupplying stations from tanks at Port Canaveral, but that facility was being closed at 3 p.m., port officials said. Propane has also run out at most retailers, and new shipments aren't expected at some stores until after the storm. Winter Park resident Leon Greenwood waited in line for nearly 30 minutes to get a full propane tank at Costco. "I've never seen a line so long," he said. After that, he headed to a Wawa gas station in eastern Orlando to fill up two 5-gallon gas cans. Lowe's manager Candace Hartley said only stores on the coasts would get new shipments before the storm. "We are out of batteries, flashlights and tarps," Hartley said. "But they are sending all new shipments to Titusville and the coast, the areas with the greatest need." Home improvement stores saw a rush of customers Wednesday looking for generators, fans, plywood and tools. Zach Rowe loaded up a cart at The Home Depot in east Orlando with a first-aid kit, tarps and plywood, hoping that he won't need them ahead of the storm. Rowe is helping organize the Orlando Come Out With Pride parade scheduled for Friday. "I've been through this so many times myself that I'm not really doing much at my house," Rowe said Wednesday. "Maybe if things still look bad tomorrow, I'll get myself prepared." karnold@orlandosentinel.com or 407-420-5664; on Twitter @kylelarnold Copyright © 2016, Orlando Sentinel AAA Hurricane Matthew: What to expect where you live Hurricane Matthew sandbag and shelter locations in Central Florida Preparing for Hurricane Matthew - Orlando News Now All Sections News Sports Business Classified Entertainment Travel Obituaries 73°

In a regulatory filing late Wednesday, Wal-Mart said that it has upped its stake in JD.com to 10.8 percent from 5.9 percent. The move comes nearly four months after Wal-Mart bought an initial stake in JD.com in a deal that also gave JD.com ownership of its Chinese e-commerce site Yihaodian, including the brand and app. Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, is trying to improve its business in China, which is lucrative but increasingly challenging. In China, Wal-Mart faces a business that has been slow and uneven. It operates more than 400 stores despite entering the country 20 years ago. It sees bolstering its online business as the future in China. Wal-Mart said at the time that it announced its initial stake that it could see a tremendous amount of traffic from JD.com's huge customer base and its same-day delivery network. Getting China right is key to strengthening Wal-Mart's global online business. In September, it completed its deal to buy fast-growing U.S. online retailer Jet.com for a purchase price of $3 billion in cash plus $300 million in stock. Wal-Mart's global online sales rose 11.8 percent in the second quarter. That's up from the 7 percent pace of the first quarter but still far weaker than the 20 percent increases from less than two years ago. ___ This story has been corrected to show that Wal-Mart Stores paid $300 million in stock in addition to $3 billion in cash for Jet.com.

The pair went directly to the electronics section at the back of the store and the woman looked out for witnesses while the man unclipped a display laptop from its base. He then shoved the laptop down the front of his pants and left through the grocery store exit while she left through the pharmacy exit. The stolen laptop is a silver HP computer, model number 15AU018WM with the serial number 5CD61953JY and is valued at $799. The man wore a red and white striped v-neck t-shirt with blue jeans and a dark baseball cap and he appears to have facial hair in surveillance images. The woman is described as heavyset and wore glasses with dark hair and she wore a dark t-shirt and jeans. Anyone with information about the suspects or the alleged crime should contact Detective Jacob Burger at 706-278-9085, dial 9 and enter extension 325.

For $24.99, here’s what you get, according to an ad for the item on a web retailer still displaying the costume: INCLUDES: Includes Dress, Head Scarf, Butt and Boobs Broom, Stockings, Slippers, Cigarette and Glasses Not Included Neither Walmart nor Amazon were selling the costume directly. Instead, a third party vendor posted the item on the store’s websites. In response, Walmart told Browning, “While it’s listed on other sites, it clearly violates our policy and was quickly removed once we were notified. We’re appalled this seller put it on our site to begin with.” Walmart added gender identity protection for employees in 2011. Its LGBT employee resource group marched in this year’s Alan Ross Texas Freedom Parade. And like Target, it doesn’t care which bathroom its transgender customers choose to pee in. — David Taffet | Follow Me on Twitter Comments (powered by FaceBook) Related posts: GLAD to file suit against Walmart for same-sex marriage discrimination Anti-gay Walmart to add 12 stores in Dallas WalMart Selling LDS Anti-Gay Children’s Book Labor Day, Walmart and me Advocates urge Amazon to stop funding Boy Scouts This entry was posted in Instant Tea, news.

Gina Northrop was shopping with her husband and eight year old daughter Monday night at the Walmart store on Route 3 in the town of Watertown. She said she took a pair of children's boots off a hanger, pulled paper out of one of them and reached into the other to pull out more paper. That's when she felt pain. "And then I looked and I was bleeding so I turned the boot upside down and a razor fell out," she said. Northrop said she left her daughter with her husband and immediately went to wash the wound. She said she reported the incident to store management, who assured her they would inspect all footwear. Northrop said Walmart's asset protection manager reviewed security camera video, which records the previous 24 hours, and saw no suspicious activity. She said she plans to file a report with the Jefferson County Sheriff's Department. Northrop decided against seeking medical attention for the injury, which she described as a "small puncture." She took a photo of the razor blade, which she says looks identical to one found in a new pair of shoes a woman bought at a Walmart in Texas. "They need to find out if this is some disgruntled factory worker who's putting razors in shoes. They need to find out where the distribution center is and I don't fell like they're doing that," she said. Northrop said she has empathy for Walmart and its employees, but will likely not shop at the retail chain in the future. "I'm not going to open shoes anymore and not check inside for razors. I'll be checking my merchandise before I use it for sure," she said. When asked for comment, the Watertown Walmart store referred 7 News to the retailer's media relations department. Erica Jones, senior manager of corporate communications, issued the following statement: "We are dumbfounded that someone would do this in our store; this is appalling. We immediately checked all of our shoes and have also done follow-up checks. Additionally, we are working (with) police and encourage anyone with information to share it with them," said Next Article Rutland Man Allegedly Throws Woman & Baby To Floor Most Popular Clayton Homeowner Praises Town in Salt Snafu Watch the video Brasher Falls Man Dies After Dog Cable Wraps Around Mower Blades Police Ask for Help In Solving Gouverneur Burglaries Watch the video Need A Ride?

Fred Neiman said some employees hid and locked their doors, while others ran outside once the gunman started firing. Neiman said workers "did the right thing" by evacuating or taking refuge and calling police. He says the gunman did fire rounds inside the store, but he did not immediately know what was struck or how many rounds were fired. He also did not know a possible motive, or how many people were in the store at the time of the shooting. An employee told KGW that the shooting took place near the Subway restaurant inside the store. Steve Gallas is a new employee who says he just had emergency training on Tuesday.  But nothing prepared him for how he felt about showing up to work shortly after the shots were fired. "Scared, nervous, not knowing what went on and then finding out there was a shooting in Subway.  I mean, that’s where I ate yesterday and I thought about that happening in there, I thought that was kind of scary," said Gallas.   Gayle Yoshizawa, an associate who answered the phone at the store, told The Associated Press that no one was injured and that "everybody is fine and the situation is under control." The store has reopened, with an area roped off where while detectives from the Clark County Major Crimes Unit investigate the shooting.

Bread aisle at Wal-Mart Neighborhood Market on Semoran Boulevard in Orlando on Wednesday, Oct. 5. (Kyle Arnold) Kyle ArnoldContact Reporter Water, bread and other emergency preparation essentials are running low at many area supermarkets prepare for the worst ahead of the threat of Hurricane Matthew. Wal-Mart and Publix stores throughout the region were down to the last varieties of bread, water had disappeared from store shelves and canned food is going fast. Shoppers such as Apopka's Danny Davenport went to Wal-Mart Neighborhood Market Wednesday with hopes of restocking his cupboards before the storm. What he found was aisles full of shoppers but short on the kinds of food he needs. "They don't have anything for bread," said Davenport. "My wife is coming home from the hospital with our new baby today, so I wanted to get things taken care of. That didn't work very well." He did manage to find snack foods and juice for his two other children, as well as pet food.  But customers began snatching up water early Tuesday, despite the efforts of store employees to keep up with demand. Lines were long too. Publix, Winn-Dixie and Wal-Mart are all bringing extra trucks to accommodate the rush demand, which is only expected to increase as Hurricane Matthew makes its anticipated pass by Central Florida early Friday. Home improvement stores saw a rush of customers Wednesday looking for generators, fans, plywood and tools. Zach Rowe loaded up a cart at Home Depot in eastern Orlando with a first aid kit, tarps and plywood, hoping that he won't need them ahead of the storm. Rowe is helping to organize the Orlando Come Out With Pride parade scheduled for Friday.  "I've been through this so many times myself that I'm not really doing much at my house," Rowe said. "Maybe if things still look bad tomorrow I'll get myself prepared." karnold@orlandosentinel.com or 407-420-5664; Twitter @kylelarnold Caption Canaveral National Seashore handles brush with Hurricane Matthew Laura Henning, a park ranger at Canaveral National Seashore, surveys the impact of high winds and storm surge from Hurricane Matthew's brush along Florida’s east coast, Wednesday, October 12, 2016.

Kim LaCapria Oct 05, 2016 Share - - Claim: Amidst "clown sightings" rumors, Walmart shoppers attacked or killed a woman "wearing too much makeup." false Example: [Collected via e-mail, October 2016] Origin:Amidst a national rumor frenzy over clown sightings across the U.S., several fake news sites published versions of stories reporting that a woman wearing "too much makeup" was shot and killed (or otherwise) attacked in the parking lot of a Walmart store. On version from 5 October 2016 stated: A 34 year-old woman identified as Kelly Perez was shot dead early Tuesday in the parking lot of a Walmart in Oklahoma City, according to police. She was shot by frightened David Brownie who felt Patricia Perez was a mischievous clown breaking into cars. Police say the victim was walking to her car after grocery shopping at her local Walmart when she was shot. David Brownie pulled out a handgun, shot the victim whom he believed was breaking into cars, police said. After the media frenzy over crazy clowns in his city David seemed very paranoid and family member of Mr. Brownie say he has always had a fear for clowns. A similar item claimed: A 26 year old woman named Melissa Reyes, resident of the Englewood neighborhood was walking home at around 7PM when she was reportedly attacked by a mob of angry black teenagers upset over the mysterious clown apparitions around the country. Reportedly, after she was beaten the perpetrators realized she wasn’t a clown she was only wearing an excessive amount of makeup. Melissa Reyes told authorities she could not identify any of her attackers but she did recall what one of the attackers had said: “Kill this f*cking clown, n*gga think sh*t sweet, this chicago n*gga, I merch that.” But all of these articles were published by fake news sites such as TheNoChill, who carry the following disclaimer: TheNoChill.com is the most notorious entertainment website in the world founded by Pancho Villa in 1922. Shared by trillions around the world. TheNoChill has previously advanced hoax news stories claiming Angelina Jolie sought to "return" her adopted children after breaking up with Brad Pitt, and that a teen was killed while trespassing during a game of Pokemon Go.

Both Target and Wal-Mart see their growth coming from pint-sized versions of their traditional cavernous stores. But they're each taking a unique approach to get there. As Target on Wednesday opens a 45,000-square-foot store in downtown Manhattan, it's cutting the ribbon on its latest effort to dive deeper into dense, more affluent markets. Fourteen of these tiny shops are slated to open by year's end, giving the bull's eye retailer a total of 32. Target CEO Brian Cornell has said he can eventually envision hundreds of these stores opening. Yet the retailer remains far behind Wal-Mart, which is likewise shedding the notion that its stores only work at more than 100,000 square feet. After scrapping its smallest-store concept earlier this year, meant to compete with the dollar store chains, the world's largest retailer is focused on building out its Neighborhood Market footprint. These nearly 700 stores average closer to 40,000 square feet. Unlike Target's small shops, Wal-Mart's Neighborhood Market stores tend to be located in more rural destinations. However, they're still closer to population centers than its superstores to appeal to shoppers who don't want to drive all the way out to those locations for a gallon of milk. Neighborhood Market stores allow Wal-Mart to capture additional, midweek spending from existing shoppers, and potentially steal share from local grocery stores. Target, in contrast, is using its small shops to gain entry into cities that didn't have the available real estate to house its 100,000-plus-square-foot stores. By doing so, it's exposing its brand to a new group of shoppers. Whereas the average Target store has historically counted 60,000 households with a median income of $74,000 in a three-mile radius, those numbers are edging higher as it opens more small shops, according to CoStar. Over the last three years, the average Target store has expanded its reach to 172,000 households in a three-mile radius, with a median household income in the range of $79,000. Yet no matter how they get there, it's crucial that each retailer looks beyond their traditional formats, analysts said. Not only do these smaller stores provide more touch points for them to connect with shoppers, they enable these brands to more efficiently connect their physical and digital capabilities, such as their in-store pickup service. "You're able to get to places where you normally might not get," Moody's analyst Charlie O'Shea said. "You extend the brand and you deepen the relationship with consumers." Bring on the traffic Despite their differences, Wal-Mart's and Target's small shops share a few similar goals, said Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners. One of those is the desire to draw frequent, repeat visits from shoppers. Because these shops tend to be located in costlier markets — and lean more heavily on low-margin products such as grocery — they'll need that volume to churn a profit. To bring in repeat shoppers, both small-store chains sell a mix of grocery, alcohol and high-velocity general merchandise, which needs to be replenished often, Johnson said. Most also feature pharmacies and a food and beverage component, which also drum up frequent visits. Target's Tribeca store, for example, includes a Chobani-branded yogurt cafe. "They're each trying to address the small-basket shopping mission," Johnson said. Both Wal-Mart and Target are likewise using their small shops to tie together their bricks-and-mortar presence with their online services. That includes marketing them as pickup points for digital orders. "I don't think any retailer that is savvy and gets it is building new stores and not having at least almost a full one eye on where it fits in a multichannel strategy," O'Shea told CNBC. "Everybody's probably thinking that way and if not, they probably should be." "It's additive overall and that's what I think you have to focus on." -Charlie O'Shea, Moody's analyst Even though these stores' small size will prohibit them from churning out the same volume as their larger counterparts — and in turn, generate a smaller return on invested capital — they can still be quite profitable, Johnson said. Though neither retailer has shared details regarding the profitability of their respective small stores, comparable sales growth at Wal-Mart's Neighborhood Market stores has been easily outpacing its overall figures. During the fiscal second quarter, same-store sales at Neighborhood Markets increased 6.5 percent, compared with 1.6 percent overall growth at Wal-Mart's U.S. fleet. Target does not break out the financials for its small stores, though it has said they generate higher sales per square foot and more frequent footfall. Yet investors shouldn't spend too much time comparing the performance at the company's various store formats, O'Shea cautioned. Similar to how digital sales work in tandem with bricks-and-mortar, both of these formats serve their own role in each company's ecosystem, he said. In Wal-Mart's case, if a Neighborhood Market store steals $20 million in revenue from a $100 million a year supercenter, but brings in an additional $40 million, it's nonetheless grabbing share from a competitor. "It's additive overall and that's what I think you have to focus on," he said. Playing to their strengths Both Target and Wal-Mart are playing to their traditional strengths to grow their small-store footprint. Target's "tarjay" image resonates well with urban shoppers, whereas Wal-Mart built its brand catering to deal-seeking rural customers, O'Shea said. By locating its shops in dense, urban markets, Target has the opportunity to attract a broader swath of shoppers — in some cases with a higher income, CoStar's senior real estate economist, Ryan McCullough, said. "Generally speaking, urban areas are growing faster with respect to populations," he said, adding that these communities are "really the only place that we've seen household incomes rise over the past 15 years on a real basis." Yet with that opportunity comes challenges. City space is hard to come by, thanks to limited building and supply. It's also pricey. Though Target declined to share details on the terms of its rent, ground floor space in lower Manhattan cost an average $294 per square foot as of the second quarter, according to CBRE. "Rents are in large part a function of store productivity," McCullough said. "They're able to charge higher rents because in general their tenants are doing more in sales." Indeed, Target's Tribeca location is just a short walk from the reimagined World Trade Center area. Roughly 60,000 residents live in downtown Manhattan, and have a median household income of $134,756, according to the latest data from the Alliance for Downtown New York. show chapters <p>Target opens small NYC shop to attract big city shoppers</p> <p>The new downtown Manhattan location is much smaller compared to the size of a regular Target store.</p> Target opens small NYC shop to attract big city shoppers    Wednesday, 5 Oct 2016 | 7:04 AM ET | 00:38 For Wal-Mart, the economics of large cities have so far kept it at bay, executives said at its shareholders meeting this summer. Because Wal-Mart's value proposition hinges on offering shoppers the lowest price, it would be difficult to churn a profit in such an expensive market. As such, it has no intentions of bringing a Neighborhood Market to Manhattan anytime soon, the company said. The world's largest retailer has already scrapped one of its small-store concepts, Wal-Mart Express. At around 15,000 square feet, these shops were designed to compete against the rapidly expanding dollar store players. Customer Growth Partners' Johnson said the logistics of these small stores proved too difficult to match with the retailer's existing supply chain, which was built upon unloading the contents of 18-wheel trucks into large stores. Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon told reporters in June that the company abandoned the roughly 100-store concept, which it started piloting in 2011, to focus on its larger supercenters. "We can't do everything," McMillon said. For both retailers, the idea of small stores is relatively nascent. At Wal-Mart, supercenters still outnumber Neighborhood Markets 5 to 1. And for Target, its small stores represent less than 2 percent of its overall base. Analysts, however, have no doubt these stores will play a more crucial role in each retailers' financials moving forward — and eventually, cause them to compete head-to-head in multiple markets. Yet the growth of these formats won't spell the demise of the companies' big-box stores, Johnson said. "I don't think there'll be any extraordinary closures of the large-format stores," he said. But with new store growth skewing toward these shops, "there will be a higher representation from the smaller-format stores with each passing year."

MUST CREDIT: Sarah Halzack, The Washington Post. The Washington Post, The Washington Post .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... ..........FRANKLIN, TENN. — On a sweaty September morning in the Nashville suburbs, Anna Brummel pulls her white SUV into a Wal-Mart parking lot to stock up on groceries. But she never sets foot in the store. The mother of three had tapped out her order on her smartphone earlier while lying in bed. And now, she parks in a designated spot during a time slot she selected, and Wal-Mart workers load up her car with the goods they picked and packed for her. Wal-Mart is America’s largest grocer, and its aggressive expansion of pickup services has turned its parking lots into a laboratory for the future of online grocery shopping – one of the trickiest puzzles in all of retail. Advertisement Continue reading Plenty of companies have tried to carve out a market for this. Instacart, along with tech titans Google and Amazon.com, have put their muscle behind doorstep grocery-delivery models that are similar to what Peapod has offered for decades. And yet, despite an e-commerce stampede that has upended sales of items such as books, electronics and clothes, researchers estimate that online shopping accounts for 2 percent or less of total U.S. grocery sales. With the pickup model, Wal-Mart is testing whether its best weapon in this digital fight is its most old-school – and hardest to replicate – asset: a network of more than 4,600 stores. It is counting on a different idea of convenience, one that caters to time-starved suburbanites who spend hours each day in their cars. Maybe for them swinging into a parking lot for a few minutes makes more sense than waiting around the house for a delivery. Kroger and Giant are also touting pickup services, and even Amazon is reportedly considering opening bricks-and-mortar locations with grocery pickup capabilities. Pickup programs, not delivery, were the main driver of growth in habitual online grocery shopping in the past year, according to Tabs Analytics, a firm that studies the consumer-products industry. While Wal-Mart does not disclose sales figures for online grocery pickup, it has taken the program from five markets to more than 80 nationally in the past year. “We see a huge opportunity through pickup, particularly in grocery,” Doug McMillon, Wal-Mart’s chief executive, told investors last year. “The combination of digital relationship and stores is a winner.” And the grocery business overall is an extremely important one for Wal-Mart, making up 56 percent of its U.S. sales last year. Advertisement Continue reading Wal-Mart executives say pickup has had particular appeal with a demographic many retailers are eager to court: millennial moms like Brummel. As her 1- and 3-year-old sons babble in their car seats, Brummel explains that they are the pint-size reasons she does her weekly shopping this way. “I physically have no room in the cart,” said Brummel, 33. “It was a nuisance before. I would have to get a babysitter, or wait till my husband was home and shop at night, and then things are kind of picked over.” Wal-Mart will have hurdles to clear as it aims to build the free service into a bigger business: For one, shoppers have often been reticent to buy groceries online because they are worried about the quality of the fresh meat and produce. This will be a consumer-psychology challenge for any company trying to get in the game, but it may be a particularly acute one for Wal-Mart. “They’ve historically gotten mediocre marks from consumers for produce and meat,” said Jim Hertel, senior vice president at Willard Bishop, a consultancy that studies the grocery business. And Wal-Mart has been outgunned online before. The retailer notched $13.7 billion in online sales last year, a far cry from the $99 billion posted by Amazon. (Jeffrey P. Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon, owns The Washington Post.) Yet, if the pickup format keeps gaining customer affection, Wal-Mart could be especially well-suited to ride the wave. About 90 percent of Americans live within 10 miles of a Wal-Mart store. — At the Wal-Mart store in Franklin, as at other locations offering pickup, the company has added personal shoppers who handle only these online orders. James Gilmore, who leads e-commerce pickup for Wal-Mart in the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast, said stores typically have four to nine staffers on the team. Advertisement Continue reading Personal shoppers get in-depth training on how to evaluate produce and meat for quality and freshness. As Gilmore walks down an aisle of fruits and vegetables, he reaches for a jicama. “We teach them how to tell the firmness – this one actually feels really good,” Gilmore says, noting that the root vegetable’s brown skin is smooth to the touch. Workers are taught to look for signs that a particular item is past its peak freshness. Wal-Mart holds produce tastings for team members so they know what they’re selecting for customers. There’s a reason that the instruction focuses so heavily on getting fresh foods right: Gilmore says that, for shoppers, letting Wal-Mart pick out their fruit, vegetables and meat is “the trust fall,” the moment when they count on a stranger to understand what they want. Of shoppers who have never bought groceries online, 67 percent say it’s because “I like to select fresh products for myself,” according to research by Morgan Stanley. This is why the personal shoppers show customers items such as produce and eggs before packing them into the car. The idea is that if someone saw an avocado that wasn’t quite ripe or an egg that was cracked, a substitution could be made on the spot. And also, personal shoppers are supposed to get to know the preferences of repeat customers, so they might learn, for example, if someone likes their bananas a little on the green side. They might also slip your dog a biscuit or your child a lollipop. Personal shopper April Styers gathers the orders, making her way through the store pushing a wheeled cart outfitted with four rows of blue bins that allow her to keep each order separate. As she stops in front of the Honeycrisp apples, she spins each one in her hand and gives it a gentle squeeze before bagging it and placing it in the cart. Advertisement Continue reading “If I’m not going to eat it,” Styers said, “then I’m not going to give it to anybody else.” — In Wal-Mart’s version of pickup, which is not yet available in the greater Washington area, shoppers have about 30,000 items to choose from – mostly groceries, but also general merchandise such as pet products or printer cartridges, all priced the same as in-store merchandise. To fill the orders, the personal shoppers make their way through the store’s grocery aisles, guided by a handheld device that takes them on the most efficient route to collect all the items. Workers have a variety of ways of knowing when a customer has arrived: They have a backroom camera pointed at the designated parking spots. Shoppers can also phone in or, in some markets, use a mobile check-in feature on the Wal-Mart Grocery app. It’s a pretty straightforward process, and it helps illuminate why Wal-Mart, in some ways, might have an advantage relative to other comers in the online grocery space. Doorstep-delivery models come with some difficult logistical hurdles: How do you transport milk to a customer’s front door and have it stay fresh? How do you reimagine a system built for selling durable goods such as books into one that works for perishables? For pickup, Wal-Mart doesn’t have to reinvent its supply chain – it is already getting these goods to its stores. “That is the opportunity. They’re redeploying an asset they already have,” said Laura Kennedy, a principal analyst at Kantar Retail. Pure-play delivery services have another challenge: The grocery world is known for its razor-thin profit margins. Add in shipping costs, and it’s extraordinarily hard to make a healthy business. The pickup model, though, eschews that cost. Advertisement Continue reading “The consumer is essentially subsidizing their supply chain by their willingness to travel to the groceries and pick them up themselves,” said Kurt Jetta, chief executive of Tabs Analytics. The logistical differences might help explain why Wal-Mart can offer pickup free, while delivery options typically come at a cost: AmazonFresh is only available to those who pay a membership fee, and Google Express requires a membership fee or per-delivery fee. Because of the popularity of Amazon Prime, it is often assumed that doorstep delivery is what shoppers think of as the ultimate convenience. But, Hertel said that for families with kids, “being at home at a given time is somewhere between really, really tough and impossible.” At the Franklin store, Ashley Green was among the millennial moms who have turned to the pickup program because it fits into their schedule. “I have two little ones in the back,” said Green, 31, gesturing to her 4- and 1-year-old daughters. “To just pick up my groceries and go, instead of getting out of the car, it takes five minutes instead of an hour.” The early results of the pickup program are tantalizing for the big-box chain: Executives say users tend to be more affluent than the typical Wal-Mart customer, and that they are often people who weren’t buying groceries there before. In its San Bruno, Calif., office, Wal-Mart has a team of techies working to find ways to shave even more time off the pickup process. To keep on top of potential customer pain points, these Silicon Valley customer-experience specialists spend one or two days a month working in a Wal-Mart store. “That gives them the opportunity to see their product in action with real customers,” said Michal Russ, director of customer experience for the online grocery program. Then they go back and tweak the app to try to cater to shoppers like Trudy Mishev, 41, who swings by the Franklin store almost every week for items such as orange juice, half-and-half and salt-and-vinegar chips. “Right now, I have a dryer going, a puppy waiting to be walked – I have a thousand things to do. And look at this, I’m on my way,” Mishev said. walmart Share Tweet LinkedIn Print Subscribe More News Suggested Stories: Wal-Mart's new tool gives competitors prices – Mar 21, 2014 Wal-Mart to expand online savings tool nationwide – Jun 4, 2014 Wal-Mart faces scrutiny at annual meeting – Jun 6, 2014 Wal-Mart's shutdown creates new food deserts – Jan 27, 2016 Advertisement Comments Subscribe to the Journal for only $12.

(Ariane Kunze/The Columbian) By Emily Gillespie, Columbian Breaking News Reporter Published: October 5, 2016, 12:30 PM A   A Clark County sheriff’s deputies quickly detained a Wyoming man who they say opened fire inside the Hazel Dell Wal-Mart early Wednesday morning. No one was shot or injured during the incident. Law enforcement swarmed the Wal-Mart, 9000 N.E. Highway 99, just before 7 a.m. when a 911 caller reported an active shooter at the store, Clark County Sheriff’s Office Sgt. Fred Neiman said. The man was reportedly firing shots near the Subway restaurant, which is inside the store near the front entrance, Neiman said. Arriving deputies entered the store and quickly detained the accused gunman, Shaun Michael Sprague, 35, of Gillette, Wyo., without further incident, Neiman said. He was arrested on suspicion of first-degree assault and booked into the Clark County Jail. After they had Sprague in custody, law enforcement searched the store for potential victims and possible accomplices, but none were located, Neiman said. The store had been open for about an hour when the shooting occurred; employees and shoppers either evacuated the store or sheltered in place by hiding and locking themselves inside, Neiman said. “It sounds like they did the right thing,” he said. Jake Bodle, a Subway employee working at the Hazel Dell location Wednesday, said that he spoke with Sprague prior to the shooting. While Bodle was outside smoking, Sprague approached him and asked him for a cigarette. Bodle declined. Sprague then came into the store and told Bodle he wanted a sandwich. Bodle said they weren’t open yet, but said he’d make him one when they got up and running. Bodle then heard Sprague ask “if there was a cop shop nearby,” which he said he found odd. “I went back in the back … when I came back out, I saw him pull out the gun, and he started shooting,” said Bodle, who said he was about 40 feet away. “He was not aiming at anybody in particular, just firing randomly out in the aisles.” He said that Sprague didn’t seem upset, but that it appeared to him that he may have had some mental health issues. Bodle ran to the back area again as he heard six or seven gunshots ring out. “At first, I just thought, ‘Is this happening?’ ” he said. “He could come back and kill me at any point.” He said he tried to call 911 but couldn’t get through. A manager at Wal-Mart, Bodle said, did get through though. He said deputies arrived within five to 10 minutes. “They took him down pretty quickly,” Bodle said. “They told him to get on the ground, and he put the gun down like he expected to be arrested.” Bodle said that his boss let him take the rest of the day off, which he spent with his 4-year-old daughter. “We’re just really fortunate that this just wasn’t a worst situation,” he said. James Kancewick, 28, was in the store shopping when he heard what sounded like a pallet drop. Then he heard several more in quick succession and peeked around the corner. “There were two employees hunkered down moving toward, I guess, the safe room,” he said. “I don’t really know the store that well, so I went to back away from where I heard the gunfire and followed the employees into the back room.” Kancewick said he thought it might be a drill, but he didn’t want to risk it and remained in the room full of nervous people while he tried to stay calm. When police secured the scene and Kancewick left the store, he said he saw a revolver and a knife on the ground near the Subway restaurant. The shooting created a tense morning for shoppers, employees working inside and their loved ones. Colby Bell was awake and at home when he got a text message from his wife, Wal-Mart employee Sierra Bell, 19, about the shooting. He tried to call, but she didn’t answer. Colby Bell said that all he could think was, “please be OK and answer my damn calls,” he said. “I need to make sure everything’s OK, that’s my wife. I love this woman and there could be something wrong with her.” His wife then responded with another text that said she couldn’t talk and that she was supposed to be silent. Colby Bell said the texts he got from his wife read: “I heard three shots and we are in lockdown, cops are here and caught the guy … I am OK though,” he said. Colby Bell put some clothes on and drove straight to the Wal-Mart. He said he’s happy his wife was OK and added that it put him at ease to see so many officers on the scene, searching cars and making sure everything was safe. “There’s a plethora of good cops here that are doing their job, working really hard and doing exactly what they’re supposed to do,” he said. “I really appreciate that.” When Sierra Bell finally exited the store, she was met with a big hug from her husband. The Hazel Dell store re-opened following the incident, and corporate communications for Wal-Mart issued the following statement: “This is an awful situation. Thankfully, our associates and customers are safe and no one was injured. We are grateful to our management team for their quick thinking in getting customers and associates out of harm’s way, and to the police for their swift action in stopping the suspect.” Detectives with the Clark County Major Crimes Unit remained on scene throughout the morning and into the early afternoon, collecting evidence and interviewing witnesses. Neiman said that law enforcement have a plan in place for an active-shooter situation and that Wednesday’s incident went as well as it could. “It’s something we train for and prepare for but that we hope never actually happens,” he said.   Emily Gillespie Columbian Breaking News Reporter  360-735-4522  @col_cops  Send an Email Please take a second to review our community guidelinesCommunity guidelines Blogs Staff Blogs Home All Politics is Local Blazer Banter Brews in Clark Cannabis Chronicles Clark County Faces Digital Desk Family Room Ghost Stories High School Sports HealthBeat History Political Beat Tailgate Talk Community It's the Fair!

And the fishermen end up serving as crew on their own boats." One of the nation's largest environmental groups -- bankrolled with $50 million from the heirs to the Walmart fortune -- has spent millions of dollars pushing a wholesale change in how the U.S. manages its fisheries, an AL.com investigation reveals. Critics blame the Environmental Defense Fund effort for hurting fishing communities on every coast, from Kake, Alaska, and Gloucester, Mass., to Bayou La Batre, Alabama. The group has pushed a system that turns the right to catch a pound of fish into a private commodity that can be bought and sold like a share of stock on Wall Street. The government then gives these shares to individual commercial fishermen, granting them the right to catch that fish, or lease or sell the right to catch it to another fisherman. EDF has been profoundly successful at persuading regulators that commercial fisheries should be managed through these so called "catch share" systems. Now the organization is turning its sights on recreational fishermen, particularly when it comes to red snapper.  The environmental group likes catch shares because they put hard limits on the number of fishermen in a given fishery, and on the number of fish caught. Instead of an open season for commercial harvest, fishermen in a catch share system are allowed to fish anytime they like, for instance when the weather is nice, until they use up their shares.  And the system provides a steady supply of red snapper for market year round, instead of just during a finite fishing season. But catch share systems are also blamed for knocking thousands of fishermen out of the industry, usually because of inequities in how the shares were originally distributed by the government. In the Gulf of Mexico's red snapper fishery for instance, some fishermen were granted the right to catch six percent of the annual harvest, worth millions of dollars a year, while others were granted as little as 0.006 percent of the harvest, or a few hundred pounds a year, meaning they could no longer earn a living from fishing. Because all other fishermen are locked out of the fishery unless they buy or lease catch shares, critics say the system has turned those who were granted the largest portion of the harvest into Sea Lords who lease the right to fish to those who received the least. Many of these lords are able to earn millions of dollars a year without ever leaving the dock, simply by bartering the right to fish. The Sea Lord problem has affected fisheries all over the country, creating haves and have-nots when it comes to the basic right to fish, and forcing hundreds of crews out of the industry. Now, with 15 of the largest commercial fisheries in the United States managed this way, EDF is working to spread catch shares to recreational fishermen. A pilot program supported by EDF in the Gulf of Mexico let about 20 charter boats – known as "head boats" that typically carry 30 to 60 anglers per day -- operate under a catch share system for two years. Those boats were allowed to fish year round, which caused a lot of friction with the rest of the charter fleet of about 1,300 boats. The bulk of the charter fleet was only allowed to fish for 46 days in the year. But the EDF's most controversial proposal has been for a system that would require private recreational anglers to have a harvest tag for each fish they catch. EDF documents examined by AL.com make plain that the organization has envisioned spreading catch shares to people fishing for pleasure since at least 2009. That year, internal reports touting EDF's accomplishments state that the organization's work in the Gulf "will form the foundation for a for-hire IFQ and harvest tags for private anglers."  This notion of requiring tags for families headed out in their boats to catch a few fish for the dinner table has proven highly contentious. Especially so when a fleet of just 400 commercial vessels is allowed to catch 5 million pounds of snapper a year while recreational anglers have suffered under annual snapper seasons as short as 10 days in recent years. While EDF officials tried to distance themselves from the idea of recreational harvest tags in a recent interview, state officials in Alabama say the group actively lobbied for such tags in private meetings with regulators. When pressed, EDF officials said harvest tags are one of several options for the recreational fishery, which they described as "out of control and very poorly known and very poorly managed." The levers of power EDF gained unprecedented access to the levers of power in 2008 when President Obama appointed the vice-chair of EDF's board – Jane Lubchenco -- as the head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which manages the nation's fish stocks. Once in power, Lubchenco, a respected but little known fisheries professor at Oregon State University, enacted a national catch share policy that mirrored EDF's longtime goals. Sea Lords and Red Snapper Sharecroppers As Lubchenco pushed for catch shares from the top, EDF staff members simultaneously organized and funded the creation of several non-profit activist groups made up of small numbers of commercial fishermen on the Gulf and Atlantic coasts. Critics say the move was intended to create the impression of grass roots support for catch shares that didn't actually exist. The leadership of these non-profits often consists of the fishermen who control the largest portion of a given fishery, who are also the folks who benefitted most from the switch to catch shares. Buddy Guindon is one of the true kingpins of the Gulf, with his seafood business responsible for about 30 percent of all red snapper landed annually. He is a strong supporter of the catch share system used to manage the fishery, and says it has been good for most fishermen. Ben Raines | braines@al.com  For instance, Buddy Guindon, the founder and executive director of the Gulf of Mexico Reef Fish Shareholders' Alliance, controls at least 4.7 percent of the red snapper harvest, one of the largest shares held. In addition, his seafood business, Katie's Seafood, handles about 30 percent of all the snapper, grouper and tilefish brought to market His group, the Shareholders' Alliance, received $623,000 from EDF between 2010 and 2014, the most recent years that records are available, according to the federal 990 tax forms filed by the organizations. Likewise with another group tied to the EDF called the Charter Fishermen's Alliance, which purports to represent charter boat captains. The charter boat group was funded entirely in its first year from a $48,000 donation from the Shareholders' Alliance, using money that came from EDF. "They work hard to make the public and politicians believe they are representing the majority of charter for hire boats when in reality they represent maybe 200 of 1,300 federally permitted owners," said Bob Zales, president of the National Association of Charterboat Operators. "Through EDF and their puppet associations such as the Charter Fishermen's Association, there is much political lobbying and at least yearly, sometimes more often, trips to D.C. to garner support for catch shares in all fisheries, commercial, charter, and private recreational with stamps." The EDF allied groups are regular fixtures at the quarterly meetings of the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council, and always speak during the public testimony sessions. The groups routinely hold strategy meetings with EDF leaders at the meetings. Bob Shipp, retired head of marine sciences at the University of South Alabama, was a longtime member of the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council. He remembers when EDF began exerting an outsized influence on fisheries policy. Ben Raines | braines@al.com  "We always hear from them at the Council meetings," said Bob Shipp, a former president and longtime member of the Council, which sets regulations for the commercial and recreational fisheries in the Gulf. "They don't explain how their groups are linked, but EDF and the fishermen with these non-profits are always on the same page." The intimate connection between EDF and the non-profits they helped start was on display on national television this year on the National Geographic TV show "Big Fish, Texas," which starred Buddy Guindon and his family. On that show, the top EDF official in the Gulf was shown in a private meeting coaching Guindon on what to say moments before he spoke to the Texas Legislature. "They pay for all of the travel, meals, everything for anyone who goes on one of these trips to Washington or the council meetings. They talk to the fishermen about what to say. And they tell the fishermen to just give them all their receipts and they'd cover everything," said Wayne Warner, who was a founding member of the Shareholder's Alliance but quit the first year because he disapproved of the environmental group's involvement. Wayne Warner Ben Raines | braines@al.com  He rejoined the group just this year. "I still always pay my own way for the trips. I don't want to owe them anything. I just think the fishermen should be looking out for themselves. Our interests and the EDF's many not always match." Going Rogue "What you are seeing is a conservation group that has gone rogue... What EDF really wants is to privatize the entire resource," said Daniel Pauly, a professor at the University of British Columbia and one of the world's preeminent fisheries scientists. Pauly is responsible for developing the concept of fishing down aquatic food webs and popularizing the notion that the world's fish stocks are much worse off than most scientists believe. He disputes the EDF position that catch shares improve fisheries. Instead, he said, they cause "economic redistribution." "Everywhere you have a catch share, a small group of people end up controlling the fishery. We have in British Columbia, one person controls 50 percent of our fishery. This is what is happening in the Gulf," Pauly said. "EDF has no business favoring the concentration of capital and ownership, but that is what it is doing." Indeed, one of the key benefits of switching to catch shares, according to Lubchenco's national catch share policy, is "consolidation" of the fleet. In other words, when catch shares are put in place, the number of people in a fishery shrinks, often dramatically, as the larger harvesters buy up shares from the smaller fishing boats. For instance, in the snapper fishery, there were 546 permits before the catch share. Today, there are 350, but just 55 fishermen catch 77 percent of the total harvest. Older catch shares around the country have experienced even more intense consolidation, according to federal statistics. In Alaska, the halibut fleet shrank from 3,450 boats before the catch share to 1,156 today. The Pacific sablefish fleet dropped from 328 boats to 87 boats in eight years under a catch share. And the Atlantic wreckfish fleet dropped from 91 boats in 1990 to fewer than five boats by 2009, according to federal records. EDF officials describe such concentration as one of several "unintended consequences." Others say it created an age of the sea lords and sharecroppers that began in earnest with Lubchenco's appointment. Lubchenco, who left NOAA in 2013 and resumed her position on the EDF board, did not respond to requests for comment. Lubchenco met fierce resistance in Massachusetts, when catch shares were enacted for the fisheries in the north Atlantic.  John Kerry, then a senator, along with Gov. Deval Patrick and most of the state's congressional delegation, bitterly opposed the introduction of catch shares, saying they would cost hundreds to thousands of jobs and devastate coastal communities. "A lot of our fishermen have been put out of business or pushed to the brink," because of catch shares, Kerry said at the time.  "Normally environmental groups and NGOs are for the little guy, but here, the EDF people are siding with the big guys, the corporate interests that want to own and privatize our fisheries," Pauly said. "It makes EDF very strange in the world of environmental groups. But then they are being funded by Walmart." Sam Rawlings Walton, grandson of the founder of Walmart, sits on the EDF board. The Walton Family Foundation, the family's non-profit arm, donated more than $50 million to EDF between 2009 and 2014. The foundation's IRS 990 forms describe that money as dedicated to "catch shares." Pauly noted that the EDF board includes "so many CEOs. Take a look. All these CEOs and investment bankers, and the major funding from Walmart," Pauly said, suggesting the EDF board, heavy on corporate influence, "has imposed on the organization, or convinced them, to go for this privatization." To Pauly, the catch share saga and EDF's involvement with one of the world's biggest corporation's has an "element of George Orwell." George Orwell, 1984  "In 1984, you have the Ministry of Peace that wages war and the Ministry of Truth that is in charge of propaganda. And the catch share? The point about catch shares is that you don't share," Pauly said. "People have bought this from EDF hook, line, and sinker. They don't think about what it means. A catch share means you can't get access to the resource because it is not shared anymore." Catch shares versus catch limits A trio of EDF officials maintained in a recent interview that the snapper catch share system was responsible for rebuilding the red snapper population in the Gulf of Mexico. They dismissed the notion that strict limits on recreational anglers -- including cutting the federal season from six months with a four fish per person limit to as short as 10 days with a two fish per day limit – played a role in the recovery.  "The snapper fishery was in almost complete collapse before the IFQ (or catch share). Without the IFQ, there really wouldn't be a red snapper fishery, and we wouldn't have fish to argue over without the IFQ," said Robert Jones, director of EDF's Gulf of Mexico operations. Asked about the ever-shorter federal seasons imposed on recreational anglers, Doug Rader, the senior scientist in EDF's Oceans Program, noted that Texas allows year-round snapper fishing, and the other Gulf states have created state seasons in protest of federal attempts to manage the fishery. "I think the recreational fishery in the Gulf is out of control and very poorly known and very poorly managed... The recreational fishery always exceeds its quota," Rader said, adding that thanks to the IFQ, "the commercial fishery is well known and managed and the catch is known down to 95 percent." And that, he said, caused the recovery. In addition, said Jones, the snapper IFQ has benefits that go beyond simply limiting the harvest of that one species. "I would hope we could have a talk about the positive job of leasing (the right to fish) and the IFQ, and the job it does especially in controlling bycatch and dead discards," Jones said, explaining that the ability to lease the right to catch snapper to fishermen targeting other species, such as grouper, has been crucial to helping stocks recover. For instance, grouper fishermen off of Florida were given shares of the grouper fishery by federal officials when the grouper IFQ was put in place. But they were not given any shares of the snapper harvest, because they did not have landings records showing a history of catching snapper. With red snapper now widespread off of Florida, the grouper fishermen are able to lease the right to catch snapper from people with a share of the snapper harvest. Jones said the IFQ program means that the grouper fishermen are able to lease the right to keep the snapper they catch instead of throwing them back, sometimes dead, which he called "double fishing." "Without the IFQ, there wouldn't be a red snapper fishery to argue over," Jones said. But many fishery scientists and regulators say that Jones is simply wrong. They argue that the rebounds in fish stocks are the result of much more robust federal management of commercial and recreational anglers that began in 2006. The law that governs U.S. fisheries, the Magnuson-Stevens Act, was beefed up during the Bush administration, requiring an end to "overfishing" for all species, which in scientific terms means catching a species faster than it can reproduce. The new version of the law also required strict catch limits in every fishery by 2011, setting a cap on how many fish could be killed each year. Those changes were the primary factor behind much lower annual quotas for both recreational and commercial snapper fishermen, which scientists say kickstarted the recovery. "Better management overall improved fish populations, not the switch to catch shares. The move to catch shares was simply coincidental," said Bob Shipp, the retired chair of marine fisheries at the University of South Alabama, and a longtime member of the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council. "I voted for catch shares, and they have their benefits, but they didn't save red snapper." Indeed the record for catch shares versus simple catch limits is inconclusive at best. There were 98 fisheries classed as "overfished" in 1999, and five fisheries approaching "an overfishing condition" according to the fishery service's report to congress that year. In the 2015 report to congress,  just 38 fisheries are considered overfished. Of the 60 fisheries no longer listed as overfished, 16 were managed under catch shares. The rest recovered due to limits on how many fish could be caught each year, or were removed from the list because scientists were unsure of the status of the stock. "The catch share definitely did not save the snapper fishery. The fishery had already rebounded thanks to catch limits before they started the catch share program. They were fishing the first ten days of the month and were staying within their quota," said Chris Blankenship, head of the Alabama Division of Marine Resources. "What the IFQ really did was make it safer for the fishermen, and helped them stretch their harvest out all year. It was good for the commercial guys, unless of course you were one of the people the IFQ removed from the fishery!" Owning a fishery Pauly said there is a predictable pattern with every catch share program he has studied. "There is in France a saying, 'even little steps lead to hell.' This is what happens with catch shares. You start with a very reasonable statement, 'You have to have a quota in the fishery.' Nobody would argue with that. Then, there is a series of reasonable steps, one after another, on this slippery slope and at the end of it, you are in hell," Pauly said. "Everything gets concentrated in the hands of a very small group of investors, people like dentists. And the fishermen end up serving as crew on their own boats.  To prevent this, the trick is that you must stop somewhere on the slippery slope." In presentations, Pauly calls catch shares, "a good idea people are turning into a bad idea." The problem, again and again, is the issue of ownership. With the catch shares supported by EDF, the fishermen are granted ownership of shares in the fishery, which they can sell, trade, lease, or pass on to their heirs. Making the catch shares transferable and permanent, that's where most regulators go wrong, Pauly said. "That's how the fishery gets taken away from the fishermen." He pointed to the experience in New Zealand's rock lobster fishery, where corporations ended up owning 85 percent of the shares in the fishery just a few years after catch shares were introduced. Pauly said the solution is to require the owner of shares in a fishery to actually captain the boat that is doing the fishing. In most U.S. catch shares, such as the red snapper IFQ, there is no such requirement. In fact, any U.S. citizen is allowed to buy, sell, or trade shares in the fishery, whether he or she has a boat, or has ever been fishing in their life. Such a requirement is bitterly opposed by the nonprofit groups established by EDF. Guindon said requiring the people who own the shares of the fishery to actually do the fishing would end up destroying the fishery. On the Big Fish, Texas show, Guindon is only shown fishing on a single episode, though he owns multiple boats and personally holds the right to catch 4.7 percent of the overall snapper quota. In addition, Guindon said he leases as many shares of the quota as he can every year from other fishermen. He said that he sends out postcards to all the other fishermen in the catch share program offering to lease their shares for the year, so he can harvest even more fish. "If you make a requirement that I go fishing, you are going to drive a lot of people out of business and you are going to hurt the fishery. People who are not in the fishery need to let those of us who are fishing, who see the fishery working, they need to let us work," Guindon said. "If they say ok, you have to use at least 30 percent of your fish on your boat, or 50 percent, well, I'm already out there with the liability of the risk of having a boat, of storing a boat, of repairing a boat. I'm going to catch 100 percent of my fish. Then that new entrant guy, the guy who is leasing fish, he's not going to be around because no one will lease him fish. All these things that take place create economic inefficiencies in an economic engine and cause it to choke, sputter, and die. That's where the real rubber meets the road." An ownership requirement such as Pauly proposes, where the owner of the quota must fish, would mean that Guindon could not harvest more than six percent of the fishery. He would no longer be able to lease extra quota in excess of the six percent cap. "Catch shares set up for owner/operator boats, this blocks this concentration. It sounds crazy, but actually exists in many countries. One of them is Denmark. Only the owner of the boat can be the captain. The boat may not be run by employees," Pauly said. The owner/operator requirement "guarantees a stopping point on the slippery slope," because it prevents holding companies from owning the fleet or the right to fish. Guindon's business model, for instance – where he owns or leases shares in the fishery that he provides to fishermen who sell him their fish -- would have to change. Guindon and others argue that such a rule amounts to socialism. Compromise or Communism "You're talking like a communist, and it's just because you don't understand," said Chris Niquet. "I am the original Sea Lord. I went out and I invested in the red snapper shares when they started the IFQ. People said to me, 'Chris, you're crazy. You're going to lose everything.' I just said, 'maybe so, do you want to sell me your fish? I'll take them all!'" Chris Niquet says he is the "original sea lord." He bought shares in the red snapper fishery as an investment and says it doesn't matter who is catching the fish. Here, he addresses the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council. Ben Raines | braines@al.com  Today, he is one of the largest quota holders in the snapper fishery, though he does not fish. He said that EDF's involvement in pushing for catch shares had made his business possible. "I bought my shares as an investment, just like a man who bought a hotel, or a shoe store, or an apartment complex, not because I'm a fisherman," Niquet said. "But this is America. We don't tell the man who bought a shoe store that he has to be the one to sell the shoes. He's allowed to have employees, operate a business. We don't tell the man who owns an apartment complex that he has to live there. Saying I have to fish if I own shares is plain Communism." Pauly disagrees.  "This requirement is not a socialist requirement, because it recognizes ownership. In fact, you cannot fish unless you are an owner. The people on the right cannot argue that you are limiting ownership, because only owners can fish," Pauly said. "You are actually encouraging more ownership, more captains and more boats." The course chosen in most U.S. catch shares has been to limit the amount of a fishery a single entity is allowed to control. For instance, in the snapper IFQ, no single individual or company is allowed to own more than 6 percent of the harvest. But in effect, that only limits the size of the corporations that control most of the fishery. It does not prevent non-fishing companies from owning the harvest, and making money off of the people doing the actual fishing. At present, about half of the snapper fishery is owned by non-fishing entities, meaning brokers and investors who earn their livings by renting the right to catch snapper to hardworking fishermen. Even Lubchenco's national catch share policy notes that ownership by investors should be discouraged. In a section about such investors controlling a fishery, the policy states that the purpose of federal fisheries law "is the conservation and management of the nation's fishery resources, not the development of speculative financial instruments or investment opportunities for individuals or businesses not substantially participating in the fishery." To Pauly, the policy itself speaks in favor of his suggestion that only fishermen be allowed to own shares of the fishery. "As I said, even little steps lead to hell on this slippery slope. The regulators, can never see where they should stop, because every step they make seems reasonable, can be justified," Pauly said. "But at the end, you end up at the opposite of where you wanted. The last step is that one person owns the fishery. Or fifty. You end up in hell, with the fishermen working as crew on their own boats. This is happening in your fishery in the Gulf of Mexico." And, he said, the folks who are protesting mostly loudly against changing the current system are the ones making the most money off the status quo.   Updated at 2:10 p.m., Oct. 19 to correct the number of fish species listed as overfished, the number of species that have recovered, and the number of those species managed under catch shares.     Updated at 3:48 p.m., Oct. 7 to clarify that Buddy Guindon's seafood business, Katie's Seafood, handles about 30 percent of the snapper, deepwater grouper and tilefish caught annually, while Guindon personally holds the right to harvest about 4.7 percent of the annual snapper quota.  You can read the first story in this series, about the Snapper Kingpins making millions without going fishing, here.

(Danny Johnston/Associated Press/Canadian Press) Lois Corbett - Walmart charging for plastic bags 7:28 Walmart will start charging five cents for each plastic bag in Maritime stores starting Oct. 17.  "We began informing customers in the Maritimes last week that we will stop giving out free single-use plastic shopping bags," said Alex Roberton, senior director of corporate affairs for Walmart Canada in an email statement.  Roberton said the hope is that people will stop using plastic bags all together and that they switch to reusable bags instead.  That's not the only bag change Walmart will be implementing. The plastic bags they do use will be larger and stronger, in an attempt to use fewer bags that way.  Robertson said that in 2015, New Brunswickers used more than 32 million plastic bags.  A welcome change for some Lois Corbett, the executive director of Conservation Council of New Brunswick, said she feels this is a good move for Walmart. She said a big corporation, such as Walmart, should always be looking to find ways it can help the environment. "Customers are ready for it," said Corbett.  "I think that New Brunswickers in particular understand the impact of wastefulness. We tend to be a quite thrifty type of people." Corbett said she hopes Walmart's change will extend to other big corporations and start a snowball effect. "What Walmart does, other retailers may have to do as well just to remain competitive," said Corbett. But not everyone is happy about Walmart's decision, such as Jaci Kay.  "I think it's the stupidest thing ever," said Kay. "It's literally a bag. We can't carry 50 groceries in our hands 20 miles."

(read more) BY PETER CAMERON, STAFF WRITER / Published: October 5, 2016 Article Tools Font size – + Share This     A Taylor police officer who also worked briefly at his local Wal-Mart has sued the company for what he calls wrongful termination. Officer Michael Zuby had been employed by both the Taylor Police Department and Wal-Mart as a security guard. The flashpoint of the dispute occurred approximately two weeks after Wal-Mart hired Officer Zuby in July 2015. While the officer was on duty with the Police Department, he stopped at the Wal-Mart store in Taylor for lunch in full uniform. His security guard boss saw him and told him he could not be armed on store property. Officer Zuby responded he was a police officer and had to be armed in his jurisdiction of Taylor. The lawsuit states the store then twice requested a letter from the borough of Taylor prohibiting Officer Zuby from entering Wal-Mart property while on duty as a police officer. According to the lawsuit, which calls the request “illegal,” the police chief refused this request both times, noting the officer may have to respond to a call there as the business is in the Police Department’s jurisdiction. Wal-Mart policy bans employees from carrying weapons of any kind while on company property, but that was not the issue here, said Randy Hargrove, a spokesman for the company. The conflict of interest of Officer Zuby serving as both a police officer and a store security guard in his police jurisdiction concerned the company, Mr. Hargrove said. Wal-Mart tried to find a remedy, Mr. Hargrove said, by offering Officer Zuby a different position at the Taylor store at the same pay rate, or another security guard job at the Pittston or Dickson City stores. He refused, Mr. Hargrove said. Wal-Mart terminated Officer Zuby on Sept. 19, 2015. He filed a lawsuit last month.

About Masthead Editorial Policy Advertising Subscriptions Contact The Williams Record Front Page News Opinions Features Arts Sports RSS Facebook Twitter BRTA considering new and more efficient bus route for North Adams October 5, 2016 by Neena Patel, News Editor The Berkshire Regional Transit Authority (BRTA) is considering creating a new bus route in North Adams that would get bus riders to their destination in a quicker and less costly fashion. This route is currently called “Route 65” and would originate and finish at the Walmart Supercenter closest to the College in North Adams on Curran Highway. The proposed route would include the following stops: Ocean State Job Lots Plaza, Massachusetts College of Liberal Arts, Main Street, Mohawk Forest and Berkshire Medical Center North Adams. It would connect with the Route 1 bus route that goes from North Adams to Pittsfield and Route 3 bus route which goes from Williamstown to North Adams. The route would function as an express route and Walmart would be the transfer point. A smaller bus would take passengers through the North Adams portion of the route and they would also have the option board a larger bus to reach Pittsfield. There have been several requests for evening and weekend bus services over the years. “If we had that extra money, this is how we would spend it,” Administrator Robert Malnati said in an iBerkshires article. “We would implement later evening services, we would try out a few different routes, see how they go how that would be received and eventually morph into a Sunday service, maybe Saturday.” The current budget that BRTA has is the same that it was given two years ago. The entire state is given $82 million dollars for transportation funding and, in the past two fiscal years, the state has been given a little bit more for its budgent; however, this year that was not the case. We’re stuck at an $82 million pot for us,” Malnati said in an iBerkshires article. “That translates to about $2.5 million for us. Fixed route service alone costs us over $4 million to put on the street as it is … what we’re trying to do is tweak it and make it more user-friendly, to go where we need to go without incurring additional costs because we know it’s not coming from the state.” The lack of funding could impact students at the College. The Route 7 bus route, which is subsidized partially by the College, could be discontinued because of lack of use. This route was created in 2013 as a request from the College so that students could reach Pittsfield faster. It runs from Stop & Shop to the Berkshire Medical Center in Pittsfield and has several stops along the way, including Wild Oats, the Clark Art Institute, Mount Greylock Re-gional High school and the College. This project was praised by President Adam Falk who believed that this would further connect the College to Williamstown and the Berkshires. The College stated the importance of this bus route by citing its vital role in allowing students to reach jobs, internships and the Berkshire community as a whole. This topic will be discussed when the ridership data for the month of September becomes available. As for the Route 65 bus, there was no one in the meeting opposed to this addition, although some people cited potential problems. This would switch to a smaller bus, which Kenneth Brick, a regular bus rider, thought would cause congestion during the beginning of the month when people are shopping at Walmart.  Another problem brought up was that sometimes people have small amounts of money left on Charlie Cards and bus drivers won’t accept them. Malnati stated that BRTA cannot administer the cards and that riders must go to the Intermodal Center in Pittsfield to add money or combine cards. Another person in attendance brought up a third problem: there is not enough space on the bus or in bike racks to accommodate the number of bikers who often use the transportation. Despite these potential issues, many riders are complementary of the daily riders and drivers of BRTA. “There’s a genuine caring there,” Yesmine Sarkis, a regular rider, said. “They care about what’s going on in our life.” Share this: Tweet Email Print { 0 comments… add one now } Cancel reply Leave a Comment Name * E-mail * Website Notify me of follow-up comments by email.

Login Search Target Hopes Smaller Stores Will Bring In More Millennials -- WSJ October 05, 2016, 02:48:00 AM EDT By Dow Jones Business News Shutterstock photo By Khadeeja Safdar Target Corp. is the latest big-box store to try small boxes. The chain is opening several smaller stores in urban areas and college towns from New York City to State College, Pa., as it battles declining traffic and sales at its nearly 1,800-strong fleet of largely suburban stores. "We could see hundreds of these," Chief Executive Brian Cornell said. "It could be a huge part of future growth outlook over time." The retail chain recently reported its first decline in existing store sales in two years and its stock has lost 13% over the past year. Mr. Cornell is trying to reinvigorate sales and better appeal to younger shoppers who are increasingly buying essentials online. Amazon.com Inc., which targets citydwellers for its Prime membership, has recently increased efforts to attract college students. But Target is attempting to succeed where others have struggled, a sign of the limited options for brick-and-mortar retailers competing with e-commerce. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. retreated from a similar experiment earlier this year, closing more than 100 of its smaller Wal-Mart Express locations to focus on its massive SuperCenters and grocery-store-style Neighborhood Market formats. Unlike Wal-Mart, which opened its Express stores largely in suburban and rural locations, Target is focusing on densely populated urban areas and customizing the assortment in each store to cater to local tastes. Target executives say the retailer is ready to move away from its traditional store model to enter new markets. "We had become really good at stamping out the same store in different markets," said Chief Operating Officer John Mulligan. "For these formats, we are rethinking everything." The new stores -- typically less than 50,000 square feet compared with the average Target store of 145,000 square feet -- are in spaces once occupied by grocery stores and neighborhood retailers. Target also wants customers to use the new stores as pickup locations for online orders, "as opposed to getting that ugly sticker from UPS or FedEx that says 'oops I missed you,' " said Mr. Cornell. One is slated to open in New York City's Tribeca neighborhood on Oct. 5 in a space once leased out to a Fairway Market grocery store that never opened. It will sell a larger selection of baby items to target the families living in the area. The store will also have a Chobani Cafe and feature a mural by a local artist. Mr. Cornell said the new stores are expected to start moving the needle in the company's overall performance in 2017 and 2018. "It brings us into neighborhoods where we don't exist today and where there is demand for our brand," he said. Some analysts say Target, which has a younger, wealthier consumer base, may have more success than Wal-Mart, while others say the strategy has limited growth potential. "A store in downtown Manhattan is interesting, but is it scalable?" said Barclays analyst Matthew McClintock. "Wal- Mart couldn't make it work with a better logistical network. It makes you wonder how Target is going to succeed." Target began trying out urban formats in 2012. The company opened 14 CityTarget and TargetExpress stores over three years and then later rebranded them as Target. As part of its deal last year to sell its pharmacies to CVS Health, it also announced plans with CVS to develop five to 10 small stores over a two-year period. Mr. Cornell, who became CEO in 2014, has doubled down on "flexible-format" stores, with plans to increase the total number to about 60 by next year. The smallest one so far, near University of California, Berkeley's campus, is less than 10% the size of a typical Target store. But downsizing can be challenging. With limited space in backrooms and on the floor, small stores require more frequent deliveries to keep items in stock. Big-box retailers also rely on a certain mix of everyday essentials and high-margin merchandise to turn a profit and draw customers to the edited selection. Wal-Mart, for example, carried fewer grocery items in its smallest format and often placed them in the same region as its Supercenters, giving shoppers less re ason to visit. Analysts also say Wal-Mart didn't sell enough high-margin products such as clothing to make the model as profitable as its larger stores. "We believe the full-sized Neighborhood Markets are better for our customers and leverage our entire infrastructure more efficiently and effectively," said a Wal-Mart spokesman. To maximize shelf space, Target has been selecting smaller package sizes and fewer brands for many of the same items offered in bulk at its larger stores. The company has also been tweaking the assortment in each store based on sales performance and customer feedback. Anne Stanchfield, Target's executive in charge of merchandising for the new stores, said figuring out the right mix of merchandise is like a "giant game of Tetris."

Walmart will open a Neighborhood Market store on Jordan Lane in Huntsville on Oct. 5, 2016. The big-box retailer will launch a 41,000-square-foot store at 7:30 a.m. Wednesday on 2305 Jordan Lane. The location, which employs 95 full- and part-time workers, has an on-site fuel station, deli, pharmacy with drive-thru and free store pickup service for customers who shop on Walmart.com. Manager Iris Gonzales runs the small-format store, which isn't as large as a typical Supercenter but provides produce, meat, baked goods, personal care items and other staples. Prospective employees can apply for positions at the store's hiring kiosk or on Walmartcareers.com. Louis J. Morris Elementary, Spay/Neuter Action Project (SNAP), the Huntsville Community Drumline and Huntsville Fire Department will receive a combined $6,000 in grants during the grand opening Wednesday. A larger public event will take place Oct. 8-9 with free food while supplies last. Walmart, which generated $482 billion in revenue during fiscal year 2016, currently has 11,527 stores under 63 banners in 28 countries and more than 2.3 million associates. Last month, the company said it will eliminate about 7,000 back-office positions from its U.S. workforce in the coming months. The accounting and invoicing job cuts will affect all of Walmart's 4,600 stores, including locations in Alabama. The number of associates per location will vary, but no more than three positions per store will be affected. In January, Walmart shut down nine Alabama locations, affecting 500-600 jobs throughout the state. The closures were part of a larger plan to shutter 269 Walmart stores across the world, including 154 in the U.S. A spokesman said more than 400 associates were able to transfer to other stores. Dozens of associates also took severance in lieu of transferring to another store or elsewhere within the company. Keep up with other Walmart news from AL.com here.

Don’t miss: Wal-Mart rivals and haters, beware Wal-Mart WMT, -0.33%   is making progress against Target TGT, +0.09%  as investments of the past several years begin to show results, according to a new report from the rating agency. Both retailers have grappled with some big challenges in recent years, said Moody’s. Target is still repairing its reputation after a massive credit-card breach in 2013 and its abrupt decision to withdraw from Canada at a cost of $5.4 billion in 2015. See: Wal-Mart’s market share gain is Target’s loss, analysts say And: Target shoppers just don’t find the fresh groceries all that appetizing Those developments combined to disrupt its business at a time when rivals were busy building up online and in other areas. Wal-Mart, for example, was investing heavily in areas that are now helping it compete better with the disruptive juggernaut that is Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +0.58%  . Read: CEO says Target will not be a full-service grocer Plus: Target to spend $20 million on private bathrooms after customer revolt “While we think it’s still early yet, we believe that Walmart’s big upfront spend to grow online, among other steps in recent months, is showing early signs of promise,” said a team of Moody’s analysts led by Charles O’Shea. “Target, in contrast, has fallen harder and has much more work to do before it can regain its footing.” See also: Holiday hiring shows the clear shift toward e-commerce The gap was evident in the companies’ most recent earnings report, with Bentonville, Ark.–based Wal-Mart beating estimates and raising its outlook, while Target’s numbers fell short and the Minneapolis-based chain lowered its guidance for the full year. Moody’s rates Wal-Mart at Aa2, or third-highest level of investment grade. It rates Target at A2, or four notches above speculative, or “junk,” status. Wal-Mart’s 1.125% notes due April 2018, its most actively traded bonds, were last quoted at 100.06 to yield 1.084%, according to MarketAxess data. Target’s most active bond, its 3.625% notes due April 2046, were quoted at 103.8 to yield 3.417%. Walmart’s grocery business, which accounts for more than half of U.S. revenue, is a key advantage over Target, said the report. Walmart, as a grocer, is about twice the size of its nearest rival, Kroger Co. Target’s grocery business accounts for about 40% of its revenue, but it is only about 15% the size of Walmart’s. “Target’s food business is disadvantaged because, among other factors, it lacks a Supercenter format with full-line grocery stores in tandem with a full-line general merchandise store,” said O’Shea. The company’s SuperTarget store format came close but did not offer the same -range of goods as is available at Walmart, while its Pfresh initiative remained too heavily skewed toward packaged products like cereal, while its perishables never really got anywhere with consumers, he said. “Target also does not have a stand-alone grocery store chain like Walmart’s Neighborhood Market, which is an obvious limitation,” said O’Shea, who does not expect a shift to grocery delivery soon. Walmart’s neighborhood stores are viewed as a good opportunity for the company to attract certain shoppers between their Supercenter visits. “We believe that Target will need to ramp up its food game to attract more frequent customer visits, which would translate into better operating performance,” said the analyst. See: The one-percenters are now destroying dollar stores On a brighter note, Target’s new line of home and kids’ apparel is expected to resonate with shoppers, which should help boost sales and profitability. But food will remain a strong factor in the driving of traffic, said O’Shea. That means it also has to contend with Costco COST, -0.22%  , which is the third largest U.S. grocer, after Walmart and Kroger. “Bottom line, without compelling food offerings, there are limits to Target’s competitive upside and its ability to claw back, soon, the ground it has lost the past year,” said the report.

There was nothing really provocative about Austin’s attempt to show these Kim Davis look-alikes that they weren’t welcome. It had everything you’d expect at an Austin Trump counter protest; a low turn-out, a (possibly) unlicensed Trump merch stand, people of Wal-Mart thanking cops for their service, police chief Art Acevedo shaking their hands in return, about 4 ski masked anarchists, and 15 clowns. Okay, that last thing was unexpected, but not really. Their message, as I understand it, was to demonstrate that Trump is a joke and that his presence and his xenophobic discussion with Sean Hannity regarding immigration were unwelcome here.   They are correct in their assertion that he was a joke. I don’t see anyone laughing anymore. Bill Maher is one of many talking heads telling us that Trump is one terrorist attack away from the presidency. He is enabling racists and bigots into violence with impunity and the best response Austin can muster up is an underwhelming and embarrassing clown show. Furthermore, Infowars sent Owen Shroyer to interview them about specifically why they were against Trump and I’m sorry to say that their answers were vague and uninformed. I suppose that credit should be given where it’s due though. Showing up is better than not showing up, and granted, this wasn’t an official Trump rally. It was a live taping of an interview with Hannity followed by a benefit dinner with the usual suspects like Rick Perry and Dan Patrick. His appearance wasn’t really meant to draw out the hordes of local supporters, it was intended for network TV viewers in swing states and for Texan donors — the best direct contributors to his campaign. There’s no way he would waste time in Austin, let alone Texas, for a major speaking event this late in the game anyway. We’re not close enough to purple yet.   Nonetheless, the people of Wal-Mart were thirsty enough to drive in from surrounding Wal-Mart towns to visit the big city. Meanwhile, no one from any of the Pride events happening down the street could be bothered to walk a few blocks to protest against the same guy who said he would “strongly consider” appointing judges to overturn the same-sex marriage decision.   I suspect that Trump’s audience members felt pretty relaxed going in and out of the same theater where ACL Live is taped, regardless of a thin blue line between them and the protestors. They were heckling the clown protesters as they passed them by, but there wasn’t a lot of edge in the air. I really had to ponder if they actually felt so threatened that they were compelled into thanking police officers for their protection and service. No one should ever feel unsafe, but how can you expect these people to take their opposition seriously if it’s represented by a handful of clowns? What message can possibly be conveyed from someone in clown makeup yelling “go home racists?” That’s exactly what they’re about to do anyway. They’re on their way to the paid parking garage after they pick up their bootleg Melania T-shirt. I don’t think they’re going to Uchi for dinner after this. Their worldview isn’t going to be changed by a clown.   But that’s just the problem with this town. Austin caters to anybody that has money underneath a veneer of white liberal nonsense. It’s conceivable that someone in a “Make Amerikkka Great Again” hat could walk into Uchi or Franklin’s and everyone else might raise an eyebrow, but they wouldn’t be able to decide if it was ironic or not. We’re still not sure if Trump’s candidacy is ironic either, but sure he can have his show here because it’s just for the money, right?   That same week students had to face the prospect of going back to school with their alt-right bro peers who may or may not be armed with a deadly weapon since Greg Abbott said they can conceal carry now. UT’s answer to this was Cocks Not Glocks. For those unfamiliar with the movement, CNG was a demonstration protesting Senate Bill 11, otherwise known as “campus carry,” whereby students brandished a dildo rather than a live firearm. The secondary intention was to raise awareness and to “fight absurdity with absurdity” in reference to UT’s prohibited expression rule regarding obscenity as defined by the Texas Penal Code. Just like Chase Trump Out of Austin, it grabbed a few headlines in local and national media. Nothing of any major consequence happened, except for the sad fact that self described “freedom fighter” Brett Sanders produced and directed a short film depicting one of the CNG organizers, Ana Lopez, graphically shot in the head by a big scary black man in her home because she defended herself with a dildo.   The video is nauseating and misses the point of the protest. Do I even need to mention that no one is advocating that you should arm yourself with a dildo? There is one scene that was very striking and its significance flies under the radar. As Lopez’s character is watching actual TV coverage of the CNG protest, reporters are interviewing the organizers and one of them remarks that they are fighting absurdity with absurdity. One of the only pronounced responses Cocks Not Glocks received was the most asinine and unrealistic video I’ve ever seen. Absurdity begets absurdity and in the end there will still be a gun in the classroom and Trump’s influence is still gaining momentum.   These kinds of protests where there’s a gimmick involved are shallow and ineffective at best. Why couldn’t Cocks Not Glocks get anyone to at least sign a petition as they were handing out toys? Maybe they did and there just wasn’t any news coverage about it, but there was nothing of the sort on their Facebook page and nothing past a donate button and a few informative videos on their website. They did not return a request for comment so I can’t be sure of the full extent of their activism, but it doesn’t make someone like me who actually cares about the issue pleased to see the only available representation selling CNG branded merchandise but nothing to offer as far as future events, meetings or any other methods of direct activism.   In fact, I’m not sure what kind of activism this is. It can be described as an attention-grabbing stunt, but I would hesitate to call it guerilla-style political activism because it lacks the tone and strategy necessary to engage the other side into discussion. It only serves to confirm the view that you already believe in. Not that humor can’t be used as a tool, but honestly it’s not like these people haven’t seen a dildo before. Shock value doesn’t haven’t to be defined by sex and violence.   I want these movements to be successful, even if they don’t permanently change anything concrete because it is at least possible to change hearts and minds. There have to be standards though. I expect more outrage, organization and direct action because the bar historically is set so high. It’s hard to say if any kind activism is effective because so much of it is either corrupted or expires prematurely. We have to stop allowing ourselves to be fooled by symbolic gestures and know the difference between activism as an industry and a playground and activism as a means to direct advancement and development.

Fortunately, there are folks committed to this work all over and several networks are forming.

Enough so, in fact, that it appears to have been taken down as of Tuesday. UPDATE: Walmart has apologized for the Halloween costume in a statement to LGBTQNation. “This was a third party Marketplace item. While it’s listed on other sites, it clearly violates our policy and was quickly removed once we were notified. We’re appalled this seller put it on our site to begin with.” Hey @Walmart, did you know the “t” word in this costume’s name is the transgender community’s “n” word? Take it down!https://t.co/SaJ2ayScCu — Jeremy Rodriguez (@RodriguezJeremy) October 4, 2016 This #Halloween you can dress as anything. Please don’t make it racist. Don’t make it transphobic. #LGBT https://t.co/zwph4H3EgV — Emily Zak (@EmilyEZak) October 4, 2016 While Walmart itself did not create or directly stock the costume according to Pink News, its appearance on the company’s website, along with the divisive name will indicate a sort of tacit approval of the word “tranny” to many. It’s an assumed stance unlikely to win them any support from the transgender community, where the slur has been rallied against for demeaning trans men and women — especially in recent years as trans people have gained more visibility. <noscript><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o5KQfAqwN4Q" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></noscript> Not that you can really cast all the blame on Walmart or any other involved party for originating the term “tranny granny” with this Halloween costume. A Twitter search reveals that it’s actually been used dozens of times just within the last month. It even has several proposed definitions on Urban Dictionary, the highest voted of which is “Old Men (preferably over 50) engaged in sexual activity dressed up as Old Lady’s [sic].” When you show your son a photo of a woman in a wig and his response is “#TrannyGranny” LMFAOOOOO!!!!! For the win! — Angel Porrino (@angelporrino) October 3, 2016 Though Walmart is no doubt about to face an uphill PR battle over the costume, they may have taken note of what happened last Halloween when another company, Spirit, was at the center of the season’s great transphobic debacle — a Caitlyn Jenner costume. To calm that media firestorm, Spirit Halloween told The New York Daily News that the “Call Me Cait” costume was meant to honor the newly public trans woman, but it seems impossible for Walmart or anyone else involved to come up with a noble justification for “tranny granny.” “Of course! Caitlyn Jenner has proven to be the most important real-life superhero of the year, and Spirit Halloween is proud to carry the costume that celebrates her.” <noscript><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mdO1RjNT7wA" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></noscript> Walmart stocking the controversial Halloween costume is hardly the frontier for debate about the use of the term “tranny.” Even within the LGBT community, non-gender conforming individuals from drag queens to transsexuals have claimed ownership of the term. Popular reality show RuPaul’s Drag Race briefly became the center of this debacle when the Emmy-winning host refused to apologize for her use of words like “tranny” and “shemale” on the show, despite calls from transgender individuals for her to stop. A Slate column at the time briefly explained the controversy behind the term. “Tranny and words like it have long been used within the queer world, among many transgender people and especially in the drag subculture, as signs of appreciation or friendship, much in the same way that some African Americans employ the word ni**er. While tranny can also certainly be used as a slur (outsiders should not use it for this reason), it is the kind of term that has been claimed by many as a celebration of their own queerness, an indication of their intention to futz with our society’s deeply ingrained gender binary. Other trans people, though, have always found the term derogatory, rejecting it out of hand.” <noscript><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tRnnbn6NP7E?list=PLx45CBh2HJtLnWVHgF9hRMTJ_PonKzpIB" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></noscript> Could Walmart have avoided the Halloween costume blowout with a name other than “tranny granny”?

The Microsoft founder's already massive wealth increased by $5billion over the past year, giving him a net worth of $81billion and putting him well ahead of runner-up Jeff Bezos. The Amazon founder worked his way into the second spot for the first time this year with $67billion, enough to narrowly edge out Warren Buffet of Berkshire Hathaway, who was down one spot with $65.5billion. Also notable are the 14 people under the age of 40 who made their way onto this year's list, with Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg leading the pack at number four with a net worth of $55.5 billion after making over $15billion in the last year. It was not however a great year for Donald Trump, who dropped to 156 on the list after losing $800million. Trump fell 35 spots from last year, and is now behind 14 immigrants on the list with his net worth of $3.7billion.  Scroll down for video  Money, money, money: Bill Gates (above in June) has topped the Forbes 400 list of the richest Americans for the 23rd consecutive year with a net worth of $81billion Billionaire boys club: Jeff Bezos (left) was number two on the list this year with $67billion while Mark Zuckerberg (right) came in at number four with $55.5billion Downgrade: Donald Trump meanwhile dropped 35 spots to 156 after losing $800million over the past year, giving him a net worth of $3.7billion The 14 Americans under the age of 40 is largely split between heirs to fortunes that now work for their family company and individuals in the technology field. In addition to Zuckerberg there is fellow Facebooker Dustin Moskowitz ($10.4billion); Airbnb founders Nathan Blecharczyk, Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia (all with $3.3billion); wireless-product maker and Memphis Grizzlies owner Robert Pera ($3.2billion); Facebook alum Sean Parker ($2.4billion); Evan Spiegel of Snapchat ($2.1billion); and Bobby Murphy of Snapchat ($1.8billion) AMERICA'S 20 RICHEST PEOPLE 1.

Michael Dell, Dell ($20billion)  Spiegel, who is just 26, is the youngest person to make this year's list. he is also engaged to supermodel Miranda Kerr. The heirs to a family fortune include Lukas Walton of Walmart ($11.2billion); Scott Duncan of the pipeline firm Enterprise Products Partners ($5.2billion); brothers Alejandro and Andres Santo Domingo who inherited their Colombian father's beer company SABMiller ($4.8billion); and their nephew Julio Mario Santo Domingo III ($2.4billion). Meanwhile, more than 10 per cent of the list is made up of immigrants, with the Russian-born Segey Brin of Google the wealthiest of them all with $37.5billion. The rest of the top five include hedge funder George Soros who was born in Hungary ($24.9billion); Len Blavatnik who immigrated to the United States from the Ukraine for college ($11.2billion); Thomas Petterfy, who after fleeing Hungary arrived in the United States with nothing more than a suitcase and went on to pioneer electronic trading ($12.6billion); and Mr. Space X himself Elon Musk, who was born in South Africa ($11.6billion). The Australian-born Murdoch clan finished just outside of the top five with $11.1billion, with most of that fortune coming from their stake in 21st Century Fox and News Corporation.  The Murdochs are also not self-made billionaires like the men above them on the list, with Rupert having inherited his first newspaper from his father as a young man.  To make this year's list an individual had to have a net worth of at least $1.7billion, meaning that 153 American billionaires did not even make the list. Among those who dropped off from last year were Jack Dorsey of Twitter and the embattled Elizabeth Holmes, whose once promising blood testing company Theranos. Holmes' net worth was put at $4.5billion in the 2015 list, but earlier this year Forbes very publicly announced that they now believe her to be worth nothing after a close examination of her company found numerous problems with the abilities of her blood-testing system.

Hamm, the CEO of Continental Resources, cut a check for $975million in January of last year to settle his divorce with wife Sue Ann Arnell.  There are also 70 bachelors or bachelorettes on this year's list, but only 14 who have never been married in their life.  Those 14 individuals are also all men, and include notable names such as PayPal's Peter Thiel, who is openly gay ($2.7billion); both Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia  of Airbnb ($3.3billion); Ubiquiti Networks, Inc. founder Robert Pera ($3.2billion); and Bobby Murphy of Snapchat ($1.8billion).

Don’t miss: Wal-Mart rivals and haters, beware Wal-Mart WMT, -0.33%   is making progress against Target TGT, +0.09%  as investments of the past several years begin to show results, according to a new report from the rating agency. Both retailers have grappled with some big challenges in recent years, said Moody’s. Target is still repairing its reputation after a massive credit-card breach in 2013 and its abrupt decision to withdraw from Canada at a cost of $5.4 billion in 2015. See: Wal-Mart’s market share gain is Target’s loss, analysts say And: Target shoppers just don’t find the fresh groceries all that appetizing Those developments combined to disrupt its business at a time when rivals were busy building up online and in other areas. Wal-Mart, for example, was investing heavily in areas that are now helping it compete better with the disruptive juggernaut that is Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +0.58%  . Read: CEO says Target will not be a full-service grocer Plus: Target to spend $20 million on private bathrooms after customer revolt “While we think it’s still early yet, we believe that Walmart’s big upfront spend to grow online, among other steps in recent months, is showing early signs of promise,” said a team of Moody’s analysts led by Charles O’Shea. “Target, in contrast, has fallen harder and has much more work to do before it can regain its footing.” See also: Holiday hiring shows the clear shift toward e-commerce The gap was evident in the companies’ most recent earnings report, with Bentonville, Ark.–based Wal-Mart beating estimates and raising its outlook, while Target’s numbers fell short and the Minneapolis-based chain lowered its guidance for the full year. Moody’s rates Wal-Mart at Aa2, or third-highest level of investment grade. It rates Target at A2, or four notches above speculative, or “junk,” status. Wal-Mart’s 1.125% notes due April 2018, its most actively traded bonds, were last quoted at 100.06 to yield 1.084%, according to MarketAxess data. Target’s most active bond, its 3.625% notes due April 2046, were quoted at 103.8 to yield 3.417%. Walmart’s grocery business, which accounts for more than half of U.S. revenue, is a key advantage over Target, said the report. Walmart, as a grocer, is about twice the size of its nearest rival, Kroger Co. Target’s grocery business accounts for about 40% of its revenue, but it is only about 15% the size of Walmart’s. “Target’s food business is disadvantaged because, among other factors, it lacks a Supercenter format with full-line grocery stores in tandem with a full-line general merchandise store,” said O’Shea. The company’s SuperTarget store format came close but did not offer the same -range of goods as is available at Walmart, while its Pfresh initiative remained too heavily skewed toward packaged products like cereal, while its perishables never really got anywhere with consumers, he said. “Target also does not have a stand-alone grocery store chain like Walmart’s Neighborhood Market, which is an obvious limitation,” said O’Shea, who does not expect a shift to grocery delivery soon. Walmart’s neighborhood stores are viewed as a good opportunity for the company to attract certain shoppers between their Supercenter visits. “We believe that Target will need to ramp up its food game to attract more frequent customer visits, which would translate into better operating performance,” said the analyst. See: The one-percenters are now destroying dollar stores On a brighter note, Target’s new line of home and kids’ apparel is expected to resonate with shoppers, which should help boost sales and profitability. But food will remain a strong factor in the driving of traffic, said O’Shea. That means it also has to contend with Costco COST, -0.21%  , which is the third largest U.S. grocer, after Walmart and Kroger. “Bottom line, without compelling food offerings, there are limits to Target’s competitive upside and its ability to claw back, soon, the ground it has lost the past year,” said the report.

Celebrity Nail Artist goes Nationwide 2016-10-03 Print Tweet   Nail Artistry Goes Global....Celebrity Nail Artist Temeka Jackson Launches Her Designs With KISS Nail Products in Walmart Stores Nationwide FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Los Angeles, CA - September 13, 2016: From stripes to chrome, green to gold, baubles to bling  the artistry of nails has created a foothold on beauty worldwide. But not everyone has access to the hottest nail artists around for a night on the town or a cruise across the waters. So they venture to their local store to get the standard selection of press-on nails in red, peach or pink. Not anymore. Now Celebrity Nail Artist and Influencer Temeka Jackson has created innovative designs that are featured by KISS nails in Walmart stores nationwide. In celebration of this amazing accomplishment, Temeka Jackson is throwing a Glamour Bash on Thursday night, October 13, 2016 in the heart of Los Angeles. This star-studded affair will be full of food, drinks, and fun and enveloped in class and sophistication. From the Red Carpet entrance to the nail artist application of her collection, this will be the celebration of celebrations. Guests include an A-Z list of Temekas high-profile clientele including Actress and Fashion Aficionado Vanessa Simmons and the night will feature a performance by So So Def Recording Artist Dondria Nicole. Sumptuous swag bags, Champagne wishes and Delicious delights will fill the halls and rooms as Temeka shares with her clients and the world her featured designs. It is a night no one should miss. What: Custom T Nails by Temeka Jackson KISS Nail Design Celebration When: October 13, 2016 6:00pm  10:00pm Where: 3930 Kenway Avenue, Los Angeles, CA 90008 Why: Its All About Nails, Hon! About Custom T Nails by Temeka Jackson When youre passionate about the work you do, your abilities and talent are clear. The people who receive the end result of the work you do are impressed. Working with nails is Temeka Jacksons thing. Whether polishing, taking care of them or coming up with innovative ways to give people a unique look, Jackson has made a business out of making peoples nails look good. At the young age of 19 while living in the New Haven, CT area she found her interest in the health and beauty field expanding. She was introduced to the art of nail artistry by a local woman, who helped cultivate her passion and desire to breakthrough the nail industry. Three years later, and 24 hours after applying to TJ Nails in New Haven, CT, Jackson earned her first spot working to hone her skills with the passion she loved. Her hobby was now becoming her profession. It was here at TJ Nails, where the young artist excited about being the first Black nail tech began to encounter discrimination from customers who thought that her being in the establishment was out of the ordinary. This put a whole new perspective and drive into Jackson. Young, motivated, and with the attitude that nothing would discourage her, Jackson continued her journey. It was that attitude which has since allowed her to earn national recognition for her trend-setting nails that have depicted historical, political, and sports related messages. In 2009 while the whole country was adjusting to the first Black president, Jackson was working on a way to translate that historical message through nail art. Her ability to do so earned her a spot in Nationally Nails Magazine. While earning magazine recognition was a great way to be acknowledged, Jacksons Obama nails gained so much attention that she was recognized on News Eight and CNN. The hard work and her unique design, helped her work in the world of fashion and beauty to do something that even the Mayor of the city acknowledged with a letter. Being versatile and creative worked in the favor of the New Haven native again for the second time by receiving a letter, from the Los Angeles Lakers, a sports team known for creating a winning legacy. Putting her mind to it and taking real care in nails has earned Jackson recognition and acknowledgment on a local and national level. It is clear that hard work and dedication has led her to be one of the hottest and most sought out nail techs in her area. Her most recent accomplishment of being honored at Fantasia in North Haven, it was bittersweet for Jackson who became the first African American to earn an award in the Nail Tech business. For Jackson the award was a long step up from having clients second guess her talent and ability because of her skin color. Her attention grabbing method which is inspired by Canvas art that comes from her imagination and the inspiration she draws from remembering her Uncle Katro Stroms work as an artist has helped her create art that conveys messages through design. With the support of family, friends and a strong customer base, Jackson has elevated what it means to be a nail technician. Taking the nail business by storm is more than just painting nails for Jackson who aspires to be a traveling technician that spreads the message about working to succeed and overcoming discrimination. Jackson has since moved to LA where her ambitions and dreams are coming to fruition. She has not only become one of the most sought after nail artist by celebrities, but she has expanded her "CustomT" brand into nail products. She recently worked with the nail product company KISS and will see her custom designed press on nails released this fall. For Jackson her hard work, dedication, and national acclaim have made her than a nail technician. She's a motivator for all up and coming nail technicians. Setting the example that your imagination and creative thinking will take you to your dreams and beyond.

Ahead of Halloween the US supermarket giant is stocking a so-called ‘Tranny Granny’ costume via its online marketplace. The costume features breast and butt pads, a dress, and a babushka-style headscarf. It appears to have made its way onto Walmart’s website via a third-party ‘Marketplace Retailer’ and it is not being directly stocked by Walmart. The costume is also stocked by Halloween supplier Spirit Halloween, which last year defended a Cailtyn Jenner Halloween costume for men. A description reads: “All the guys will be dressing up as superheroes and princes, but you will stand out among the rest in this hilarious Granny Men’s Costume! “The costume includes a white tank dress with pink collar and colorful flowers all over as well as curvaceous butt and boob pads to complete the look. “This granny wouldn’t go anywhere without her pink babushka with flower design headband to keep her hair perfectly in place. “Slap on some makeup and get ready for your granny walk and you will have the room roaring with laughter!” Walmart did not immediately return a request for comment.

Walmart.com now runs on Electrode, at least in part. Since January, @WalmartLabs has been helping Walmart.com, which consists of about two dozen applications, migrate from Handlebars.js, Backbone.js, and Java to React (Facebook's popular UI framework) and Node.js. The transition was about a third complete in July, when Alex Grigoryan, director of software engineering for application platforms at @WalmartLabs, estimated that within three months, 98 per cent of traffic to the website would flow through React and Node components. The website for Sam's Club, owned by Walmart, should complete a similar transition by the end of the year. The reason @WalmartLabs changed technological horses midstream, Grigoryan explained at the Node.js Summit over the summer, is because the company wanted an up-to-date technological foundation that provided better scalability, better performance, better productivity, and reusability of components. The fact that Walmart.com is handling 80 million monthly visitors, 10,000 requests per second, and some 15 million items suggests Electrode's scalability at least won't disappoint. Walmart.com's performance has improved too, Grigoryan says. The home page, a server-side rendered page, now loads 20 per cent faster. Similarly, the login page is 15 per cent faster. Pages previously rendered client-side and now rendered server-side have shown speed improvements of up to 30 per cent, while JavaScript bundle sizes have been reduced 20 per cent. The Electrode platform has made @WalmartLabs developers more productive, claims Grigoryan. "We're able to on-board our engineers the same day that they join @WalmartLabs," he writes. "Most engineers are able to release code within a few days of their start date." Previously, developer training took five days and it was about a week before new developers committed any code. Component reusability also improves productivity, Grigoryan suggests, through reduced time to market. Grigoryan highlights Electrode's organizational benefits, as well. Developing in the JavaScript world, at least the corner occupied by React and Node, can be something of a mess. There's seemingly no end to the number of libraries, frameworks, packages, modules, and tools that can work their way into projects. Electrode Boilerplate includes many of these technologies out of the box, thereby allowing developers to spend less time configuring projects and more time writing code. ® Sponsored: Magic quadrant for enterprise mobility management suites Tips and corrections 5 Comments More from The Register Walmart sues Visa for being too lax with protecting chip cards The only thing lower than our prices is your security! 66 Comments Walmart spied on workers' Tweets, blogs before protests Defence contractor Lockheed Martin provided intelligence services before Black Friday 35 Comments Walmart to open-source its cloud-hopping code Retail giant offers skeleton key to escape cloud lock-in from … oh, no cloud in particular 10 Comments Walmart takes its DevOps platform and piles it high on GitHub Mega grocer throwing rotten tomatoes at Amazon? 5 Comments If Amazon can have delivery drones, we want them too, says Walmart FAA gets another license to delay until too late 26 Comments US govt drafts Google, Walmart, Amazon, BestBuy execs for drone registration system Task force to draw up database for owners of flying gizmos 4 Comments Whitepapers Data and Analytics Maturity Model and Business Impact How top performing enterprises use their IT investments to store, process, and use data to make more effective, real-time decisions.

SALT LAKE CITY, Oct. 4, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Purple, Inc., (https://onpurple.com/) a comfort company known for its revolutionary "No-Pressure™" mattress has appointed Sam Bernards as chief executive officer. This announcement comes after Purple experienced rapid growth its first year. In eight months the company grew from 38 to more than 340 employees and has added a 574,000 square-foot manufacturing building. This growth was jumpstarted by the popular "Goldilocks" video that went viral after its January release. Purple's videos have had more than 100 million views through Facebook and Youtube combined. "This is the perfect time for Sam Bernards to become Purple's next CEO. We've selected an experienced leader at a time when Purple is poised for growth," said Purple co-founder Tony Pearce. "I am convinced there is no better leader for Purple today." The Purple® Bed began last year when it funded $171,000 on Kickstarter. In less than a year, Purple has received more than 2,500 online reviews and is now a leader in the competitive E-Commerce mattress space. Since the Kickstarter launch, sales have skyrocketed, according to Pearce. "What we accomplished on Kickstarter in 45 days has sometimes been surpassed in less than a day in sales," Pearce said. Now, Pearce says it's time to bring on a new CEO to help Purple reach its full potential in a competitive and constantly changing industry. "Today's pace of change is exponential," Pearce said. "Sam has deep experience in the retail and supply chain sector and will move the company forward with the speed required to capitalize on the opportunities in front of us." After having started multiple companies, Bernards joined Walmart in 2006 and moved quickly through the company's ranks, driving forward a $2 billion program to optimize its global supply chain, a $7 billion program for strategic supplier management, and an $80 billion growth strategy for Walmart US, which resulted in the launch of Walmart Express and other innovations. "I joined Purple because I wanted to be a part of a company that has the ability to solve the very real pain of uncomfortable sleep for millions—and soon billions—of people," said Bernards. "Deep, healing sleep is fundamental for health, growth and happiness, and Purple has a uniquely powerful solution to change sleep from what once was difficult to delightful." Purple has a mission to help those in pain by using science to develop products to help people be more comfortable whether they are sitting, standing or sleeping. "The co-founders have created a suite of soon-to-be-released products that will impact how people stand and sit. This is meaningful to me, and I am convinced of Purple's ability to achieve its global potential," Bernards said. Looking forward, Bernards has several goals for the company. "I am focused on accelerating the innovation and execution that our customers need from us. Their happiness will continue to drive us. At a time when the bed industry is just beginning to experience a renaissance, I am thrilled to be a part of Purple's role in transforming the quality and comfort of people's lives." The Pearces have been observing and vetting Bernards for 16 years. Confident in Bernards' ability to lead the company into its next phase, the Pearces will be able to focus on the research and development of new products. "Sam is clearly the leader for Purple's future," Pearce said. "With Sam Bernards taking the role of CEO, the board is very confident Purple has the leadership to drive its success for the next chapter." About Purple After 20 years of creating and licensing comfort products, Tony and Terry Pearce launched Purple in January 2016. The founders have been granted 34 patents in the advanced cushioning arena. Sixteen patents and pending patents were used in creating the World's First No Pressure™ Mattress and future products. Purple has quickly become a leader in sleep and comfort technology. Its products change lives through dramatic improvements to the quality of sleeping, sitting and standing.

Published Oct 3rd, 2016 8:40 pm ksouza@talkbusiness.net / @tbarkansas While the three recent announced store closures by Walmart U.S. are just a tiny slice of the retailer’s larger national footprint, the move does reinforce management’s focus on performance and connecting physical stores to online sales. Walmart U.S. plans to close two discount stores in west Texas and one campus store in Columbia, Mo., in the coming weeks as the leases on these properties expire. This is in-line with the retailer’s strategy to simplify business operations and cut loose stores that don’t fit into Walmart U.S. CEO Greg Foran’s game plan to run high-performing stores with grocery including online orders and store pickup options. Walmart spokeswoman Anne Hatfield said the Texas closures involve a pair of older discount stores in Lamesa and nearby Brownfield, Texas. Both were built around 1987, predating supercenters and have limited grocery items and far more general merchandise. About 155 workers from the two stores will have the opportunity to transfer to other stores in the region, but there are no other Walmart stores in those small Texas towns. Hatfield said the retailers will work with the displaced employees to help them find other jobs. She said Walmart offers reviews of resumes and interview skills to any workers being displaced. The Lamesa store will close later this month and its workers will be paid through Dec. 9. The Brownfield stores will remain open through the holidays and close in late January. Those workers will be paid through the first week of February. Hatfield said Walmart also offers severance pay after those date for eligible workers. Hatfield said full time workers who have been with the company for more than one year would be eligible for severance. Generally, full-time employees receive a week’s pay for every year of continuous service. Hatfield said store performance is one of the metrics used by the retailer to determine which stores are closed. Both Texas stores were leased properties and Hatfield said when the lease came up for renewal, Walmart opted to close the locations. As of Aug.10, Walmart operated 22 of the older Discount Stores across Texas. There will be two less before the company’s fiscal new year in February. In its home state of Arkansas there are still seven of the older Discount Store models in operation. Nationwide there are 428 of the older Discount Stores which are candidates for closure if they underperform financially given they don’t offer a full-line of grocery. Earlier this year Walmart U.S. closed 154 of its stores, which included 102 of the smaller Express formats, 23 Neighborhood Markets, 12 Supercenters, 7 stores in Puerto Rico, 6 Discount Stores and 4 Sam’s Club. Also on the chopping block is the small Walmart Campus Store at the University of Missouri in Columbia, which was founder Sam Walton’s Alma Mater. Walmart spokeswoman Della Garcia said the store is in a leased space and it will close at the end of this week. Garcia said the 11 workers in the test format will be given priority hiring at three supercenter stores and one Sam’s Club located within three miles of the campus store. “Walmart remains committed to offering convenience shopping options in Columbia. This week we rolled out online grocery to the Columbia market,” Garcia said. She said the campus store in Columbia was part on an ongoing test for convenience formats on college campuses. There are three other campus stores still involved in the test and they are not being affected by this closure. Those locations are: University of Arkansas (Fayetteville), University of Richmond (Richmond, Va.), and Arizona State University (Tempe, Ariz.). Garcia said profitability is a factor in the campus stores and they only carry about 5,000 items, compared to 40,000 items in a Neighborhood Market and 120,000 items in a supercenter. The Discount stores carry around 100,000 items but very limited grocery and no fresh foods. Foran told the media in June that a well-run supercenter remains the best profit center for the retailer. He said the new generation Neighborhood Markets with fuel and pharmacy also hold their own. Smaller formats present issues because they they do not allow for fresh meat and produce, bakery, deli and other areas on which the retailer is focusing. The store closures are more fodder for the union-backed groups like Making a Change at Walmart who called the store closures “a callous move by Walmart.” Author Bio: See latest posts Comments 17shares Talk Business & Politics by email Arkansas headlines delivered to you on demand Email address Statewide Newsletter Northeast Arkansas Newsletter Fort Smith Newsletter Northwest Arkansas Newsletter Submit Opinion Ruth Whitney Volunteering should be part of the business plan Michael Tilley Riff Raff: A Veterans Day remembrance Justin Allen Marijuana and the constitutionality of ‘Shall means shall’ Randy Zook Issue 3 will mean jobs for Arkansas Michael Tilley Riff Raff: 3 concerns with Issue 3 Special Sections Home Privacy Policy and Terms of Use Magazine Opinion © 2015 Talk Business & Politics.

The retail giant coughed up a rumored $90 million to Morgan after one of its drivers crashed into his limousine in 2014. Morgan suffered a brain injury and numerous fractures in the crash, which also killed another passenger and injured three others. But Walmart's insurers, who are trying to avoid taking the hit for the payments, believe Morgan's health problems can be disproved after he was spotted driving around New York in a Lamborghini and appearing at the Emmy's shortly after the settlement. The insurers are now accusing the 30 Rock star of refusing to hand over his medical records, tax returns and other documents relating to his public appearances after the settlement - in response to a subpoena served on him six months ago. Comedian Tracy Morgan (pictured last month) is accused of refusing to hand over medical records and other documents ordered as part of a legal battle over a multi-million dollar crash settlement paid out to him by supermarket Walmart Walmart's insurers, who are trying to avoid taking the hit for the payments, believe Morgan's health problems can be disproved. Morgan is pictured in July 2014, one month after the crash In a legal letter seen by DailyMail.com, lawyers for Walmart's insurers The Ohio Casualty Insurance Company call on the case judge to set a hearing in the case due to Morgan's failure to produce the documents.

He was also forced to put an FX series he had in development on hold after the accident. One of Walmart's drivers crashed into Morgan's limousine (pictured in an image released by the NTSB to show the damage), leaving the comedian with a brain injury and fractures  Morgan's friend,  comic James McNair died in the crash when a tractor-trailer driven by Walmart employee Kevin Roper slammed into the back of their limo van (pictured on its side) However Walmart's insurers first filed papers in August alleging that the supermarket had paid an 'exorbitant' settlement in order to avoid bad publicity. They also claimed the amount paid out to Morgan and his fellow passengers was excessive in comparison to their actual injuries - and accused Walmart of failing to conduct adequate investigations before settling. The suit read: 'Within weeks of Walmart settling with Morgan, Morgan was seen driving one of the most powerful sports cars in midtown Manhattan, driving without any difficulty and clearly showing he was enjoying himself,' the documents state. 'Walmart would have learned that Morgan was capable of doing these things had it done an adequate and reasonable investigation before settling.' The supermarket chain fired back this week saying they entered into these settlements in good faith and even paid Morgan and the other victims out of their own pockets. They explained they held responsibility for the accident, which is why they did the right thing and settled the claims quickly, rather than trying to invent reasons to dispute them - which they accuse the insurers of doing to them. Morgan spent almost two months in the hospital and rehab following the accident before he could return home. Pictured is the Walmart truck after the crash Walmart added that four other insurers they have paid out on their policies and has accused Ohio Casualty of being 'unnaturally obsessed' with Morgan’s activity post-settlement, such as the purchase of a new car. Ohio Casualty has now filed documents demanding that Judge Lois Goodman, who is overseeing the case, 'address a very serious problem' involving Morgan and six others refusing to hand over his medical records and other documents as requested by the subpoena. In papers filed on Monday, the insurers claim Morgan's lawyer told them he would authorize the release of his medical records but has failed to follow through. The subpoena is demanding Morgan hands over all settlement-related documents, any and all medical examinations records since January 1st, 2015, Federal and State personal tax returns for 2009-2014, documents that refer or relate to the potential future earnings for the comedian, all financial information related to Morgan’s earnings for the five years prior to the crash. They also request any 'documents generated after the settlement that refer or relate to his appearing on national television shortly after the settlement, driving a Lamborghini in midtown Manhattan shortly after the settlement, Tracy Morgan’s ability to walk around midtown New York shortly after the settlement and his appearance at the Emmy Awards to make a presentation.' The judge has yet to set a date for a hearing.

KSHB Copyright 2016 Scripps Media, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. Show Caption Hide Caption Previous Next MISSION, Kan. - The developer in the Mission Gateway project is looking for a new anchor tenant after Walmart decided last week not to be part of the project. The news means Mission continues to lose tax money because the property at Shawnee Mission and Nall is vacant. Mission Mayor Steven Schowengerdt explained that the previous mall generated $1 million a year in taxes for Mission. He said the developer informed the council last Thursday that Walmart was no longer part of the deal, and he is looking for new retailers and a new plan for the prime land. Walmart planned to close its Roeland Park store and move it to the Mission Gateway location. Now that Walmart is not part of Mission Gateway, the Roeland Park store will remain open. Three years ago, taxes were raised in Roeland Park to prepare for Walmart to close. Now that it will not close Joel Marquardt, the mayor of Roeland Park, said there will be a discussion about next year's budget and whether or not the tax should be lowered. Longtime Mission resident Betty Benson is 95 years old. She owns the Mission Artists Workshoppe. She is disappointed that the land is still vacant and hopes a department store will become the anchor tenant.  "When we had Dillard's we loved it, when we had Macy's we loved it," said Benson. A number of individuals and some neighborhood groups in Mission fought the project that morphed over the years into a track and apartments on top of the Walmart. On October 13 and 14 at Mission City Hall, Mission residents will have a chance to express their opinions about what restaurants and businesses they would like to see on the land. ------   Cynthia Newsome can be reached at Cynthia.Newsome@kshb.com.

Published Oct 5th, 2016 4:01 pm ksouza@talkbusiness.net / @tbarkansas Wal-Mart Stores continues to test innovation anywhere it can. On Monday (Oct. 10) the world’s largest retailer will begin in its Bentonville office a new incubator for six interns with entrepreneurial ideas. It’s a venture with Grit Studio, the incubator and startup effort spearheaded by former Wal-Mart executive Rick Webb. He told Talk Business & Politics the Walton Family Foundation is providing Grit Studio some funding in part for research he’s doing on the entrepreneurial landscape in Northwest Arkansas. He said the Walton family is providing Grit Studio the office and meeting space on S.E. 5th St., in downtown Bentonville, just a few blocks from the retailer’s home office and close to its technology center. From acquiring the disruptive e-commerce startup Jet.com to employing Bentonville high school interns for project oriented tasks, the partnership with Grit is another interesting move by a retailer challenged to boost market share and compete with a growing number of pure online retailers. Webb said the new internal incubator is the first of what he expects to be many more with other large area companies such as J.B. Hunt Transport, Sam’s Club and Tyson Foods. He said there are six people in the Wal-Mart internal incubator who have ideas or ventures they want to launch. Webb said Wal-Mart chose its candidates through an application process with input from Grit Studios. The six already for work Wal-Mart in it’s technology division. Over the next 12 weeks Grit Studio and Wal-Mart will put the six interns through what Webb called a rigorous accelerator program. After that, those with promising possibilities could be placed into a two-year incubator program depending on how Wal-Mart chooses to proceed. Webb said it’s early in the initial process and there are some aspects still being discussed, such as if Wal-Mart will have exclusive rights to the ideas and who will own the idea/technology. “It a beta for Wal-Mart and we will figure more of this out in the coming weeks,” Webb said. “Wal-Mart is covering the expense related to the internal incubator. This entire model for Grit Studio is not as much as about raising capital as it is about fostering resources and tools needed to accelerate.” Rick Webb He said the important thing is to get large companies onboard with local innovation, and internal internships are a good place to begin. Webb said it could be a positive for Wal-Mart and other companies that offer internal incubators because it allows them keep the innovation local and retain the talent. BIG THREE COMPANIES BENEFIT FROM COLLABORATION Webb retired as senior vice president of global processes and innovation at Wal-Mart last year to focus on more work in the local entrepreneurial sector. He hopes to connect large companies and startup ideas through a support system that could help the region feature a dozen $1 billion companies, adding to the big three of Wal-Mart, J.B. Hunt and Tyson Foods. He said the big companies benefit from collaboration and innovation support and help support because it feeds the recruitment and retention of talented people. He said the big three realize it’s better to collaborate and grow a community than to divide and compete for the limited resources. Webb modeled the Grit Studio program after a long-term incubator in Miami, Fla., that has been successful over three years turning out companies worth hundreds of millions of dollars. “If we could just get a few $10 million companies that would be great for this region,” Webb added. He said Grit Studio is a node for entrepreneurial support in Benton County to augment what is available in Fayetteville with the Innovation Hub, Hayseed Ventures and others. He is also recruiting startup founders whose businesses might be worth a $1 million who are interested in building a support system in the region and through regimented programs, internships and partnerships try to grow those companies exponentially over two to three years. He admitted it’s like to trying to coordinate a difficult dance with all types of talent but said it’s also rewarding work that has garnered support from folks like Steuart and Tom Walton – grandsons of Wal-Mart Stores co-founders Helen and Sam Walton – who see possibilities to grow Northwest Arkansas’ economy for generations to come. “I have two young granddaughters and it’s my hope that someday they won’t have to work for one of the big three if they want to stay here. I hope they have dozens of employment possibilities here in 10 to 12 years when they enter the workforce. That would be quite a legacy. That’s the dream anyway,” Webb said. Webb’s Grit Studio was the host for the CPG Innovator’s Conference in Bentonville on Wednesday (Oct. 5). Webb opened the day’s events by discussing his new venture Grit Studio, where he shared the vision for his work. REGION WILL NEED NEW IDEAS Jeff Amerine, co-founder of Startup Junkie, said the idea that Northwest Arkansas is the center of universe for consumer package goods and retail might be true, but if that is to continue driving forward in the future it will take new ideas, technologies and product innovation that will be the next billion dollar opportunities. Serial entrepreneur Dr. John James, co-founder of Acumen Brands and more recently head of Hayseed Ventures, said during his speech that Wal-Mart and all of retail must be faster and do more. He said grocery pickup, which his wife describes as “wonderful” is not enough, and at the very least Walmart should have offered this 8 to 10 years ago. James, a professed Amazon junkie, said that company continues to disrupt, most recently announced plans to build out its own last mile delivery system aimed directly as UPS and FedEx. “People love Nike, not FootLocker,” he explained. “Retailers with massive brick and mortar presences like Wal-Mart have some advantages but they have to innovate quickly. Disruptors are looming and they are apt to kill the sacred cows.” Author Bio: See latest posts Comments 42shares Talk Business & Politics by email Arkansas headlines delivered to you on demand Email address Statewide Newsletter Northeast Arkansas Newsletter Fort Smith Newsletter Northwest Arkansas Newsletter Submit Opinion Ruth Whitney Volunteering should be part of the business plan Michael Tilley Riff Raff: A Veterans Day remembrance Justin Allen Marijuana and the constitutionality of ‘Shall means shall’ Randy Zook Issue 3 will mean jobs for Arkansas Michael Tilley Riff Raff: 3 concerns with Issue 3 Special Sections Home Privacy Policy and Terms of Use Magazine Opinion © 2015 Talk Business & Politics.

Roston - Oct 5, 2016 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Kohl’s is the latest store that has decided to make its own mobile payment system and it’s called, you guessed it, Kohl’s Pay. Much like Walmart Pay and CVS Pay, Kohl’s Pay enables shoppers to pay for their items using their phone and saved card data rather than using the card itself, allowing them to carry just their phone around rather than their phone and a wallet. Kohl’s Pay is available for both iOS and Android as of now; once installed, you add your payment cards the same way you would with, for example, Android Pay; the app supports the Yes2You Rewards ID, too, for receiving rewards for transactions. The cards show up in the app with their name and the last four digits of their numbers. Those with a Kohl’s Charge card get the same benefits using the app (with the card linked) as using the physical card itself. Making a payment with the app works basically the same way as with Walmart Pay via a QR code. Receipts are delivered to and stored in the Kohl’s app for returns later on, though a paper receipt can be requested. As well, the Kohl’s Pay app also automatically redeems offers and Kohl’s Cash. It’s a nice offering for those who frequent the retailer, but it does appear to have a pretty big limit: Kohl’s only mentions adding the Kohl’s Charge card, but not other debit/credit cards. It’s not clear at this point whether only the Kohl’s Charge card is accepted, but if that is the case, it’ll be a pretty big limitation compared to most other mobile payment systems.

Kohl’s Joins Store-Specific Payment App Party Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Kohl’s Joins Store-Specific Payment App Party Image courtesy of Mike Mozart October 5, 2016 4:27 pm EST By Laura Northrup@lnorthrup app-happy payment apps store payment apps apps If you thought that it was confusing to carry around a stack of store charge cards, how about installing a stack of store-specific payment apps on your phone? Now joining Walmart, Cumberland Farms, and other QR code-happy retailers is Kohl’s Pay, a new module inside the store app that many customers already have installed. 14 million people have already at least downloaded the Kohls app, and 25 million have the store’s credit card, and the discount department store figures that there must be some overlap between those groups. The big difference between Kohl’s Pay and Walmart Pay is that while Walmart lets shoppers use a variety of payment methods in its app, the Kohls app is only for the store’s own credit card. “You used to have to take out your loyalty card, your charge card, and your coupons,” the company’s chief technology officer told Fortune. “Now you just have to take out the app in one step.” The idea is to make stacking different kinds of loyalty programs and deals to encourage customers to buy more… even if they left their coupon, their store card, or their whole wallet at home. Are retailers going to expect us to download separate apps for every store now, though? Isn’t this why you can add your Kohl’s card to Apple Pay?

(Target via AP) This Tuesday, Oct. 4, 2016, photo provided by Target shows the exterior of a new Target store in Manhattan's Tribeca area, in New York. The discounter opened the store, which is one-third the size of its regular stores, on Wednesday, Oct. 5. It’s part of a strategy to open dozens of small stores in the U.S. that are customized to college towns and dense urban markets. (Target via AP) Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (3) New York • Target is thinking small to win over shoppers. The discounter opened a store in downtown Manhattan on Wednesday that's just its second location in Manhattan and is one-third the size of its regular stores. This store in the Tribeca area is part of Target's strategy to open dozens of small stores in the U.S. that are customized to college towns and dense urban markets. The two-level store, still 45,000 square feet, is geared to young couples, families, working professionals and students. It has a Chobani Cafe offering salads and yogurt drinks in what is the trendy yogurt maker's first retail partnership. It's also testing an area for shoppers to make customized T-shirts and features art from a local artist. VIDEOS TOP JOBS At the front of the store, online shoppers can pick up their orders. And it's testing a checkout strategy similar to Whole Foods, where shoppers queue according to a color. Minneapolis-based Target plans to invest nearly $1 billion in stores this year, including new store openings. Others in the works in the same format will be in Philadelphia and State College, Pennsylvania, near Penn State. The new store format is part of Target's strategy to boost sales and customer traffic under CEO Brian Cornell. The company reported in August that sales at established stores fell 1.1 percent, after seven straight quarters of gain. And it also saw fewer customers in the store. Expanding into the smaller-store format can be risky. Early this year, Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the world's largest retailer, closed all 102 Wal-Mart Express stores, its smallest format that aimed to be a convenient option for people in rural and urban areas. The stores were about 12,000 square feet and offered essentials like toothpaste. But Wal-Mart said there was too much of an overlap with its Neighborhood Market stores. Shannon Buhro, Target's district team leader for the New York area, says she believes the new Target will attract customers who had previously shopped at several different stores in the area, from drugstores to food and small clothing stores, to fill their needs. She also noted that the store will have more sales associates than stores of similar formats, since the company expects heavy traffic at this one. "It's going to be localized," she said. "Are we going to see people coming from other neighborhoods? I think we will." On the first level of the Manhattan Target store are trendy clothes, including some for children, and a selection of stylish home goods like candles, dishes and pillows. The Chobani Cafe is off to the side. The basement level looks more like a typical Target, with a wide assortment of food including perishables, more clothes and home products and beauty products. The electronics area focuses on smaller TVs to fit customers' apartments.   Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY 3 photos VIEW PHOTO GALLERY JOIN THE DISCUSSION     Post a Comment POPULAR STORIES It's not easy being black at BYU, film shows Garrison Keillor: Politics is not everything.

(Photo: LAMAUR STANCIL/TREASURE COAST Newspapers) 36 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Retiree Teresa Clark had no trouble gathering bottled water and ice at WalMart, 5800 20th St., Vero Beach, on Wednesday in advance of Hurricane Matthew. She did have trouble, however, finding her Toyota Corolla in the crowded parking lot. Clark pushed her cart — with two bags of ice, a plastic-wrapped bundle of two dozen bottles of water, plus other items — around the east end of the shopping center. She held her key fob in the air and clicked it a few times, listening for the beep from her car. A few fellow shoppers/good Samaritans stopped to assist the senior citizen. They spotted the car two rows away from where Clark had been wandering. "We've got to help each other in times like these," Clark said, hugging the man and woman who found the car. "That's the important thing," Many other WalMart shoppers — once they found their cars — also were loading their trunks with ice and water Wednesday afternoon. The store was well stocked with those items, as well as with flashlights. Other shoppers noted the store was out of bread and "D" batteries. Retirees Paul and Tish Nash are set to experience their second major storm in the past four years. The couple recently relocated to Vero Beach from Connecticut, where they dealt with Superstorm Sandy in 2012. Most stores in Vero Beach had barren shelves in their bread sections on Wednesday, but The Fresh Market had several loaves available.  (Photo: LAMAUR STANCIL/TREASURE COAST NEWSPAPERS) "We didn't have power for 14 days," Paul Nash said. 36 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://www.tcpalm.com/story/weather/hurricanes/2016/10/05/vero-beach-has-supplies-but-also-packed-parking-lot/91604400/ More Stories Sunny day ahead with high near 79 | Tropics, radar Nov. 17, 2016, 7:12 p.m. Temperatures along Treasure Coast expected to plummet later this week Nov. 14, 2016, 3:25 p.m. Warm October continues trend of above-average temperatures Nov. 6, 2016, 1:30 p.m.

Published Oct 5th, 2016 1:07 pm robin.mero@gmail.com / @tbarkansas The Walmart U.S. grocery pickup service arrived a dozen years too late and cost the retailer its advantage, John James told entrepreneurs at Thursday’s (Oct. 5) CPG Innovators Conference in Bentonville. “I think the writing is on the wall,” said James, founder of Acumen Brands and its consumer-direct sales superstar Country Outfitter. “Amazon switched to ‘for’ internet sales tax, and that shows me Amazon is going to build a warehouse in every state. They’re building a Fedex/UPS competitor, and I don’t know what Walmart can do; their tremendous lead is getting smaller everyday.” James conceded that Wal-Mart’s recent $3.3 billion acquisition of Jet.com was “either the best or worst purchase ever made, and I personally think it was best. But Walmart has taken far too long to use their 3,800 stores as an advantage.” To the gathering of entrepreneurs and Walmart suppliers, meeting less than two miles from headquarters of the giant retailer, James joked, “I just lost all my friends,” based on his admission. “There’s something visceral about the experience I have with Amazon. I’ve been a Prime member since the day it came out. Everything shows up on my doorstep, and I think that’s where we’re headed,” James said. The Jet.com deal closed Sept. 19 and included bringing Jet CEO Marc Lore into the Wal-Mart management team. Lore joins Walmart’s leadership team, serving as executive vice president at Walmart and president and CEO of Walmart eCommerce in the U.S. He will lead Walmart.com and Jet.com, and report to Wal-Mart Stores CEO Doug McMillon. A self-proclaimed “tech geek ex-doctor,” James launched his first ecommerce venture from a University of Arkansas dorm room in 1993, easily financing medical school with the earnings. In 2009, he and a partner launched Acumen Brands and raised $104 million in venture capital with a disruptive strategy of bypassing retailers and mining customers directly via Google and Facebook. A retailer today is essentially a “dumb pipe,” James said. “Consumer loyalty is in the brand, not the retailer. People don’t care where they buy stuff, as long as it shows up with a good experience and good price.” Emerging brands will continue to disrupt giants, James predicted, as with Dollar Shave Club (recently acquired by Unilever for $1 billion) and the Honest Company. Both relied upon bite-sized content to fuse direct lines of communication with consumers. James said he met in Los Angeles with founders of both companies and turned down a job offer from Jessica Alba. “You’re going to see a lot more of these brands coming up,” he said. “Disruption comes from outside an industry and kills all the sacred cows.” James’ remarks were part of the fifth CPG Innovators Conference, presented by Supplier Community in conjunction with Startup Junkie Consulting.

(Photo: Jimmy Settle / The Leaf-Chronicle)Buy Photo 375 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 6 COMMENTEMAILMORE CLARKSVILLE — Developers still aren't confirming any tenants for the planned grocery store-anchored shopping center at Vaughan Road near exit 11 — but they are confirming one thing that it isn't, to refute one aspect of the wild, citywide rumor mill of late. Developer Fred Hohnadel, of Tampa, Fla., said the shopping center won't add another Walmart or other discount big-box retailer to Clarksville's already-large lineup. "I will tell you now, it is not a Walmart," he said. He doesn't rule out a large grocery store chain. But he said it's still early to reveal exactly who is likely coming, pending local government approvals. "We still can't say too much about it other than, we do have the property there under contract, and it will be a shopping center anchored by a large grocery store," said Hohnadel, of Redstone Investments, a company with offices in Tampa and Youngstown, Ohio, that is partnering with Nashville's Brookside Properties in the Vaughan Road venture. He said the development, in addition to the major grocery feature encompassing about 46,000 square feet, would have up to 10 additional stores and a couple of free-standing retail buildings featuring such tenants as a restaurant, or financial institution. The whole property would face Martin Luther King Jr. Parkway (Highway 76). "We've had meetings with people who live in the Vaughan Road area," Hohnadel said, "and these are people who are most directly impacted by our planned development. We are obviously looking forward to them being good customers." The project, developers have said previously, would include some widening and improvements to Vaughan Road and its intersection with the Parkway. The Clarksville City Council is set to vote Thursday evening on first reading of the rezoning request that will represent a next step in the process.

The real estate magnate got $4.96 billion in free earned media in the year leading up to the presidential election, according to data from tracking firm mediaQuant. Over the past 12 months, the president-elect received more than $800 million in free earned broadcast media, compared to $666 million for Clinton, and $2.6 billion in free earned online news attention, compared to $1.6 billion for his rival. He edged out her and other major political names in American and worldwide newspapers as well.

Both retailers have grappled with some big challenges in recent years, said Moody’s. Target is still repairing its reputation after a massive credit-card breach in 2013 and its abrupt decision to withdraw from Canada at a cost of $5.4 billion in 2015.  Those developments combined to disrupt its business at a time when rivals were busy building up online and in other areas. Wal-Mart, for example, was investing heavily in areas that are now helping it compete better with the disruptive juggernaut that is Amazon.com Inc.(AMZN) . “While we think it’s still early yet, we believe that Walmart’s big upfront spend to grow online, among other steps in recent months, is showing early signs of promise,” said a team of Moody’s analysts led by Charles O’Shea. “Target, in contrast, has fallen harder and has much more work to do before it can regain its footing.”  The gap was evident in the companies’ most recent earnings report, with Bentonville, Arkansas–based Wal-Mart beating estimates and raising its outlook, while Target’s numbers fell short and the Minneapolis-based chain lowered its guidance for the full year. Moody’s rates Wal-Mart at Aa2, or third-highest level of investment grade. It rates Target at A2, or four notches above speculative, or “junk,” status. Wal-Mart’s 1.125% notes due April 2018, its most actively traded bonds, were last quoted at 100.06 to yield 1.084%, according to MarketAxess data. Target’s most active bond, its 3.625% notes due April 2046, were quoted at 103.8 to yield 3.417%. Walmart’s grocery business, which accounts for more than half of U.S. revenue, is a key advantage over Target, said the report. Walmart, as a grocer, is about twice the size of its nearest rival, Kroger Co. Target’s grocery business accounts for about 40% of its revenue, but it is only about 15% the size of Walmart’s. “Target’s food business is disadvantaged because, among other factors, it lacks a Supercenter format with full-line grocery stores in tandem with a full-line general merchandise store,” said O’Shea. The company’s SuperTarget store format came close but did not offer the same -range of goods as is available at Walmart, while its Pfresh initiative remained too heavily skewed toward packaged products like cereal, while its perishables never really got anywhere with consumers, he said. “Target also does not have a stand-alone grocery store chain like Walmart’s Neighborhood Market, which is an obvious limitation,” said O’Shea, who does not expect a shift to grocery delivery soon. Walmart’s neighborhood stores are viewed as a good opportunity for the company to attract certain shoppers between their Supercenter visits. “We believe that Target will need to ramp up its food game to attract more frequent customer visits, which would translate into better operating performance,” said the analyst. On a brighter note, Target’s new line of home and kids’ apparel is expected to resonate with shoppers, which should help boost sales and profitability. But food will remain a strong factor in the driving of traffic, said O’Shea. That means it also has to contend with Costco (COST) , which is the third largest U.S. grocer, after Walmart and Kroger. “Bottom line, without compelling food offerings, there are limits to Target’s competitive upside and its ability to claw back, soon, the ground it has lost the past year,” said the report.

The discounter opened a store in downtown Manhattan on Wednesday that’s just its second location in Manhattan and is one-third the size of its regular stores. This store in the Tribeca area is part of Target’s strategy to open dozens of small stores in the U.S. that are customized to college towns and dense urban markets. The two-level store, still 45,000 square feet, is geared to young couples, families, working professionals and students. It has a Chobani Cafe offering salads and yogurt drinks in what is the trendy yogurt maker’s first retail partnership. It’s also testing an area for shoppers to make customized T-shirts and features art from a local artist. At the front of the store, online shoppers can pick up their orders. And it’s testing a checkout strategy similar to Whole Foods, where shoppers queue according to a colour. Minneapolis-based Target plans to invest nearly $1 billion in stores this year, including new store openings. Others in the works in the same format will be in Philadelphia and State College, Pennsylvania, near Penn State. The new store format is part of Target’s strategy to boost sales and customer traffic under CEO Brian Cornell. The company reported in August that sales at established stores fell 1.1 per cent, after seven straight quarters of gain. And it also saw fewer customers in the store. Expanding into the smaller-store format can be risky. Early this year, Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the world’s largest retailer, closed all 102 Wal-Mart Express stores, its smallest format that aimed to be a convenient option for people in rural and urban areas. The stores were about 12,000 square feet and offered essentials like toothpaste. But Wal-Mart said there was too much of an overlap with its Neighborhood Market stores. Shannon Buhro, Target’s district team leader for the New York area, says she believes the new Target will attract customers who had previously shopped at several different stores in the area, from drugstores to food and small clothing stores, to fill their needs. She also noted that the store will have more sales associates than stores of similar formats, since the company expects heavy traffic at this one. “It’s going to be localized,” she said. “Are we going to see people coming from other neighbourhoods? I think we will.” On the first level of the Manhattan Target store are trendy clothes, including some for children, and a selection of stylish home goods like candles, dishes and pillows. The Chobani Cafe is off to the side. The basement level looks more like a typical Target, with a wide assortment of food including perishables, more clothes and home products and beauty products. The electronics area focuses on smaller TVs to fit customers’ apartments. ____ Follow Anne D’Innocenzio http://twitter.com/ADInnocenzio shares Share: Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Google+ Share Email Advertisement Advertisement    Leave a comment Hide comments Comments are closed.

Motley Fool Staff (the_motley_fool) Oct 5, 2016 at 8:01AM According to pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts, brand-name drug prices increased 16.2% in 2015 and they've skyrocketed 98.2% since 2011. Runaway drug prices are forcing insurers to increase patients' share of the cost of medicine, resulting in consumers shelling out more money for their prescriptions than ever before. If you're looking for ways to reduce your monthly spending on prescription medicine, we have a few suggestions. In this clip from The Motley Fool's Industry Focus: Healthcare podcast, healthcare analyst Kristine Harjes and contributor Todd Campbell walk you through some of the best money-saving tips for controlling how much you spend on medicine. A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on Sept. 28, 2016. Kristine Harjes: Let's start with shopping around for the medications and drugs you need. Todd Campbell: Yeah. People are probably going to be pretty surprised, but there's a very wide range of prices that you can pay for prescription medicine depending on where you get it filled. The price that you might pay at a CVS might be very different, for example, than the price that you could pay at a Costco or a Wal-Mart, depending upon that drug. So, it's very important for consumers to think about what medications they're regularly getting filled, are they generics or brand-name drugs, and if they're generics, especially, make sure you check out those big-box retail stores. Places like Wal-Mart and Target and even some supermarkets have deals where they offer prescriptions for less than $5 on many generic drugs. So, there's some significant savings that can be accomplished that way. There's a website, actually, called GoodRx, which allows you to search by where you live and find out different prices of medications with in your area. That can be helpful as well. Sometimes they have coupons, too, on that site. Harjes: And if you're not taking a brand name, find out if there is a generic. That's step 1. Campbell: Yeah, ask the question. If you've been on a certain brand of medication for a long time, there's a potential that there's going to be a generic out there. Harjes: Right, it could have come off patent. Campbell: Yeah. The price savings alone could be tremendous -- 80% to 90% for typical generic drugs. If you take a high-cost biologic medicine, too, you may soon be able to request a biosimilar. They're not exact replicas of those brand-name drugs, but they work very similarly to them. The FDA is getting much more willing to approve those drugs. Those could offer savings, too, I think 30% to 40%. Harjes: Right, that's what they're estimating. You mentioned Costco. Before we totally abandon that name, I just found this out -- apparently Costco's pharmacy is open to non-members. Campbell: Anybody can go. Harjes: That is pretty awesome. I know for a fact that most of my family gets their prescription medications from Costco because it is significantly cheaper. And I always thought, it's because they're members. But no, anybody can go in there. Campbell: Yeah, anybody can go in there. Call around, you can reach the pharmacies and say, "I need to get this filled, how much will it cost me?" They'll tell you. There's other things that you can do to reduce your costs of prescription drugs as well. You can get a 90-day prescriptions instead of 30 day prescriptions, which can sometimes save you money on copays. Also, if you're on a plan like mine that maybe doesn't have the best drug coverage, ask your pharmacy how much the cash price is rather than running it through your insurance. You might find that the cash price is cheaper than it would be if you run it through your insurance. I think that's a good pro tip. Harjes: Another thing you can look into is a mail-order pharmacy -- they sometimes offer you three-month supplies for the price of one. That can be a pretty big money saver as well.  Kristine Harjes owns shares of Costco Wholesale. Todd Campbell has no position in any stocks mentioned.

(Vetr) Jefferies analyst Daniel Binder had the opportunity to speak with John Hulbert, Vice President of investor relations at Target Corporation (NYSE: TGT), at the firms Investor Relations Summit. According to the analyst, the discussion focused on Target’s response to the high-competition environment, food strategy, ecommerce, electronics, pharmacy and cost cutting. Hulbert noted that Wal-Mart’s pricing activity has been augmented by its marketing practices: TV broadcast spending and an advertising emphasis on competitive consumable pricing, according to Binder. “He also noted that food competition in general is intense and can be seen at other competitors, not just Wal-Mart,” said the analyst. Related Link: Is Target The King Of Online Retail? “Target is working toward a better balance in its focus and messaging around ‘Expect More. Pay Less.’ Greater emphasis is being put on the pay less side,” said Binder in reference to Target’s strategy in response to the competitive retail environment. According to the analyst, Hulbert said he sees the “Expect More” side of the mantra has been properly executed, and that more focus needs to be put on the “Pay Less” in marketing and messaging practices, stating that he sees pricing as being where it should be. Jefferies maintained a Hold rating for Target and $72 price target. At time of writing, shares of Target were trading at $68.40.

Horváth, Dean of the Schulich School of Business at York University, today announced the official release of a thought-provoking new book, Re-Imagining Capitalism, that charts a hopeful and constructive path forward for a capitalist system under increasing pressure to change to address its impact on society, the environment, and prosperity. Edited by McKinsey's Dominic Barton, Schulich's Dezsö J. Horváth and Matthias Kipping, Business History Chair at Schulich, Re-Imagining Capitalism brings together renowned academics, global executives and NGO leaders who reflect on the major issues confronting capitalism and who put forward a number of innovative proposals. Acknowledging the growing public distrust of capitalism and its ability to improve wealth and well-being for the many, the editors call for urgent reforms at a structural and global level to re-establish the traditional bonds between business and society and to ensure that the free market system continues to create value for the long term that benefits all stakeholders and communities. "This volume," they write in the introductory chapter, "reflects both the urgency of the needed action and the opportunity to achieve a wide-ranging agreement and lasting movement towards a more responsible, equitable, and sustainable model of capitalism in order to generate long-term value." In addition to contributions from thought leaders at Schulich and McKinsey, Re-Imagining Capitalism includes chapters by many visionary business leaders, including Unilever CEO Paul Polman; Indian business legend Ratan N. Tata, former chairman of Tata & Sons; Loblaw Executive Chairman Galen G. Weston; former Desjardins CEO Monique Leroux; Doug McMillon, President and CEO of Walmart, and Kathleen McLaughlin, President of the Walmart Foundation; and Royal Bank of Canada vice-president and former Globe and Mail Editor John Stackhouse, as well as other world-renowned academics such John Kay, one of Britain's leading economists; Lynn Stout, a legal scholar and well-known critic of an exclusive shareholder value focus; and Ed Freeman, who has been developing and advocating the stakeholder model for many decades. In the book's concluding chapter, "Capitalism Re-Imagined", Horváth and Barton summarize the way forward based on the many suggestions and actions presented by the book's authors: "Whichever direction capitalism ends up taking, it is increasingly apparent that the narrow shareholder model is being gradually eclipsed by a model that is more closely attuned to the complexity and diversity of the world we live in - a model that is more stakeholder oriented and more guided by principles of long-term value creation and sustainability. It is a model where boards and executives act more like owners, and asset owners and managers invest for the long term; where employees are increasingly treated as partners in the profitability and success of the business; where consumers and suppliers are increasingly engaged as co-creators in shaping the products and services that businesses provide; and where corporations are fully integrated into the communities and countries in which they operate." As examples, they point in particular to capitalist systems in Scandinavia that have successfully combined globally competitive and innovative free markets with policies that focus business attention on all stakeholders to better ensure the wealth and well-being of all citizens. And, most importantly, Horváth and Barton provide clear hope for the future: "If there is anything we have learned from history, it is that capitalism is incredibly resilient." The book is published by Oxford University Press. For more information on the book, please visit the Oxford University Press website.

"Following" : "Follow"}} October 05, 2016 11:05am   Comments Share: Related WMT 5 Good Things And 4 Bad From Wal-Mart's Earnings Mid-Afternoon Market Update: Children's Place Rises On Strong Q3 Results; DryShips Shares Tumble Delta, American Airlines Are Buys; Saleforce.com PT Hiked (Investor's Business Daily) Credit Suisse’s Edward J. Kelly expects Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE: WMT) to provide key updates on its three-year plan when the company hosts its 2016 investor day on October 6. Kelly maintains an Outperform rating on the company and a price target of $80. Updates The analyst expects Wal-Mart to focus on drivers of prolonged traffic growth given that the gas benefit is now lapping. Kelly also expects the company to provide an update on its e-commerce strategy and outlook for price cuts, as well as an update on its international strategy and initiatives to improve its share of fresh food. Related Link: Is Target The King Of Online Retail? Stock Performance “Overall, the day may present some risk to WMT's stock given the potential for a material ramp in e-commerce losses in 2017, but this concern is not new at this point,” the analyst mentioned. Kelly also expressed concern regarding the impact of Wal-Mart’s stock on that of its competitors, such as dollar stores and food retailers, given the company’s “disruptive mindset,” which is an industry headwind. Sustained Traffic Needed Noting that sustained traffic gains would be critical, especially given the lack of meaningful bottom line growth, the analyst stated Wal-Mart has “outperformed staples peers from a top-line perspective despite beginning to cycle investments in customer service and tailwinds from lower gas prices.” Full ratings data available on Benzinga Pro.

Photo: Netflix MORE FROM: Kyle Smith ‘Manchester by the Sea’ is one of the year’s great films Mesmerizing Tom Ford thriller ‘Nocturnal Animals’ is a must-see Warren Beatty and Annette Bening could both win Oscars this year J.K. Rowling's latest is really about gay liberation Trump should save his tough talk for terrorists Instantly acclaimed as one of the most important documentaries of the year, Ava DuVernay’s film about the mass incarceration of black men, “13th,” wowed audiences at the New York Film Festival and looks like a leading Oscar contender as it premieres in theaters and on Netflix on Friday. Disappointingly, given the importance of the underlying issues, the film is a morass of distortions, half-truths, calculated omissions, absurd hyperbole and outright falsehoods. Equating Donald Trump supporters with Deep South lynch mobs isn’t even its most outlandish tactic. DuVernay, the director of “Selma,” begins the film with a much-discussed but irrelevant statistic: The US, home to 5 percent of the world’s population, is also home to (nearly) 25 percent of the world’s prisoners. Anyone who has ever thought about this imbalance, which tends to get trotted out in campaign seasons, will quickly understand the reason why: The US has a lot more crime than other countries. If you think judges should sentence criminals based not on what they’ve been convicted of, but based on international incarceration disparities, fine. Let’s start with your neighborhood. Go ahead, lean on your local judges to let murderers and rapists off with a warning. It’s all for the noble cause of leveling out our incarceration rate, right? DuVernay constructs her film around the fatuous notion that the 13th Amendment, which outlawed slavery, was deliberately constructed with a loophole that was meant to continue the mass enslavement of black people using indirect means. The “loophole”? Convicted criminals can still be deprived of liberty. But this isn’t a loophole, it’s just a restatement of common sense. The US, like every other country on Earth, can lock you up if you are convicted of a crime. If this were so controversial, why has no one thought to be outraged about it before? Viewers (such as film critics) who don’t pay especially close attention to the news pages are likely to be suckered by the misinformation in the movie. No, Woodrow Wilson didn’t say “The Birth of a Nation” was “history written with lightning.” No, Trayvon Martin didn’t die because of Florida’s “Stand Your Ground” law, which wasn’t even cited by George Zimmerman’s defenders. Martin died because Zimmerman exercised self-defense after Martin jumped on Zimmerman, punched him in the nose and pounded his head into the pavement. Zimmerman had injuries that backed up his story. No, Walmart didn’t back the American Legislative Executive Council because it was fantasizing about people buying more Walmart guns to defend themselves under Stand Your Ground. (Walmart hasn’t even sold handguns since 1993; long guns are so infrequently used in homicides that more people die of wounds sustained from kicking and punching.) As for the movie’s contention that John Ehrlichman, a key aide to President Richard Nixon, spilled the beans on racist drug policies when he allegedly said that Nixon cracked down on marijuana because he wanted to lock up hippies, and heroin because he wanted to lock up blacks — let’s look at the facts. Ehrlichman allegedly gave this juicy quote to lefty journalist Dan Baum in 1994. Baum, who was writing a book on the drug wars that he published two years later, didn’t use the quote then. He didn’t tell anyone about the quote during the remainder of Ehrlichman’s life, which ended in 1999. Not until 2012 did Baum suddenly remember he was sitting on the quote of the century when it came to drug policy, and finally published it. Do you really believe a journalist would sit on a bombshell quote like that for 18 years? “13th,” which, especially in its final minutes, is unabashedly designed to motivate left-wing voters to get them to the polls, is purposefully vague during a strange tangent about Black Panthers and other Woodstock-era radicals. It avoids going into detail about, for instance, Assata Shakur, a convicted cop-killer who broke out of prison and fled to Cuba, who is portrayed as a hero here. Van Jones, the ex-communist and 9/11 truther who appears repeatedly in the film as an expert witness, tells us that an entire generation of leaders was put in prison or forced to leave the country. “Leaders”? Tell that to all of the shooting and bombing victims of 1960s radicals. If your goal is to decrease the black prison population, extolling violent 1960s revolutionaries is a strange way to go about it. Normalizing and even sentimentalizing left-wing 1960s extremists has become the new normal, however. Weren’t the Black Panther uniforms cool? As recently as a decade ago, you’d have had to visit a college campus to encounter such gullibility. Yet the film saves the worst for last, closing with the shocking contention that blacks have made so little progress in the last 50 years that we’re still living in the Jim Crow era under a different name. This is an insult to the Civil Rights-era heroes who moved mountains in the cause of liberty and justice. It’s an insult to Martin Luther King Jr., the hero of DuVernay’s last film, “Selma.” Share this: Facebook Twitter Google WhatsApp Email Copy Filed under ava duvernay ,  imprisonment Share this article: Share this: Facebook Twitter Google WhatsApp Email Copy Read Next The hottest movies of the New York Film Festival Read Next The hottest movies of the New York Film Festival Most Popular This Week 1 The one scenario that could still get Hillary into the White House 2 Did this astronaut warn of aliens before attempting suicide? 3 Melania Trump's girl-on-girl photos from racy shoot revealed 4 Kellyanne Conway tells The Post she feels 'blessed’ over White House gig 5 Insiders say Donald Trump is 'disgusted' by Chris Christie 6 Scenes from the liberal meltdown Share Selection Trending Now on NYPost.com 201,637 Did this astronaut warn of aliens before attempting suicide? 70,327 Clinton gets mixed reaction after going makeup-free for speech 52,230 This list of topics is the quickest way to anger your liberal friends Now On ‘GoT’ star Lena Headey fighting to keep son in U.K. Blac Chyna drops 15 pounds a week after giving birth Marilyn Monroe’s ‘Happy Birthday’ gown sells for $4.8M SEE ALL Video :40 Cop caught on camera sucker-punching woman Now On Jon Stewart Calls Liberals Hypocrites For Saying Trump Voters Are Racist SEE ALL More Stories pagesix 'Kimmy Schmidt' actress reportedly commits suicide in Peru hotel Now On Decider New Netflix Documentary Goes Deep On The Greatest X-Rated Movies Of All-Time nypost Did this astronaut warn of aliens before attempting suicide?

Horvath, Dean of the Schulich School of Business at York University, today announced the official release of a thought-provoking new book, Re-Imagining Capitalism, that charts a hopeful and constructive path forward for a capitalist system under increasing pressure to change to address its impact on society, the environment, and prosperity. Edited by McKinsey's Dominic Barton, Schulich's Dezso J. Horvath and Matthias Kipping, Business History Chair at Schulich, Re-Imagining Capitalism brings together renowned academics, global executives and NGO leaders who reflect on the major issues confronting capitalism and who put forward a number of innovative proposals. Acknowledging the growing public distrust of capitalism and its ability to improve wealth and well-being for the many, the editors call for urgent reforms at a structural and global level to re-establish the traditional bonds between business and society and to ensure that the free market system continues to create value for the long term that benefits all stakeholders and communities. "This volume," they write in the introductory chapter, "reflects both the urgency of the needed action and the opportunity to achieve a wide-ranging agreement and lasting movement towards a more responsible, equitable, and sustainable model of capitalism in order to generate long-term value." In addition to contributions from thought leaders at Schulich and McKinsey, Re-Imagining Capitalism includes chapters by many visionary business leaders, including Unilever CEO Paul Polman; Indian business legend Ratan N. Tata, former chairman of Tata & Sons; Loblaw Executive Chairman Galen G. Weston; former Desjardins CEO Monique Leroux; Doug McMillon, President and CEO of Walmart, and Kathleen McLaughlin, President of the Walmart Foundation; and Royal Bank of Canada vice-president and former Globe and Mail Editor John Stackhouse, as well as other world-renowned academics such John Kay, one of Britain's leading economists; Lynn Stout, a legal scholar and well-known critic of an exclusive shareholder value focus; and Ed Freeman, who has been developing and advocating the stakeholder model for many decades. In the book's concluding chapter, "Capitalism Re-Imagined", Horvath and Barton summarize the way forward based on the many suggestions and actions presented by the book's authors: "Whichever direction capitalism ends up taking, it is increasingly apparent that the narrow shareholder model is being gradually eclipsed by a model that is more closely attuned to the complexity and diversity of the world we live in - a model that is more stakeholder oriented and more guided by principles of long-term value creation and sustainability. It is a model where boards and executives act more like owners, and asset owners and managers invest for the long term; where employees are increasingly treated as partners in the profitability and success of the business; where consumers and suppliers are increasingly engaged as co-creators in shaping the products and services that businesses provide; and where corporations are fully integrated into the communities and countries in which they operate." As examples, they point in particular to capitalist systems in Scandinavia that have successfully combined globally competitive and innovative free markets with policies that focus business attention on all stakeholders to better ensure the wealth and well-being of all citizens. And, most importantly, Horvath and Barton provide clear hope for the future: "If there is anything we have learned from history, it is that capitalism is incredibly resilient." The book is published by Oxford University Press. For more information on the book, please visit the Oxford University Press website.

Washington, DC (PRWEB) October 05, 2016 The second annual Million Women Mentors Summit & Gala, held in Washington, DC on October 4 and 5, 2016, brings together leaders with the shared goal of attracting and retaining more women in the STEM workforce through high quality mentorships. Representatives come from industry, higher education, government and nonprofit organizations from around the country for the two day workshop. Since launching less than three years ago, the movement has accumulated nearly 850,000 pledges to mentor women and girls, of which 400,000 are complete and the movement has committed to securing 1,000,000 pledges by the end of 2016. The two-day event brings together 37 state delegations, many led by Governors and Lieutenant Governors. Currently, 17 Lieutenant Governors serve as chairs of their respective delegations and four will be attending from Alabama, Arkansas, Maryland and New Jersey. Million Women Mentors (MWM) aims to increase female participation in the STEM workforce by providing a national platform to engage industry, government and implementation partners. It seeks to tap into the tremendous human capital potential of our nation’s employers to excite, inspire and recruit the next generation of STEM professionals. This Summit provides a unique opportunity for partners and sponsors from around the country to share insights into what is working and seek answers to shared challenges. National nonprofit partners participating in the Summit include FIRST, MIND Research Institute and Girls Inc. Leading sponsor corporations will also send delegations including Tata Consultancy Services, BP, Walmart, PepsiCo and Intel. Greta Van Susteren will keynote the Summit Luncheon and Megan Murphy, Washington Bureau Chief and Executive Editor at Bloomberg News, will keynote and emcee the Million Women Mentors Gala.

Key Summit Highlights include: New Online Portal – A new, mobile-friendly Million Women Mentors web portal created by Tata Consultancy Services supports mentors and mentoring programs with new features such as the ability to log the progress of working with mentees and sharing documents and resources among communities of mentors, companies and/or girl-serving organizations. MWM Awards – The Summit concludes with a Gala on the evening of October 5th where 6 awards will recognize excellence over the last year in supporting Million Women Mentors.

As a founding sponsor of Million Women Mentors, Tata Consultancy Services has been a leader in the MWM movement by completing 32,467 mentorships – over twice its initial pledge of 15,000 – and through the design of both the original and redesigned web platforms. "With over 119,000 women in our own workforce we are a proud founding partner of Million Women Mentors, and deeply cherish the results that this movement has achieved over the past three years. I strongly believe that income equality is the foundation for gender equality & social equity. By bringing together the combined power of purpose, people and technology, we are removing barriers for women in STEM education and careers, helping them realize their full potential. We are proud to support this initiative through mentoring and by providing the technology to enable impactful mentorships in STEM fields." – Balaji Ganapathy, Head of Workforce Effectiveness, Tata Consultancy Services and Vice Chair, MWM Leadership Council.

The release of the Women’s Quick Facts book creates for the first time a “one-stop shop” for critical data points about women in today's workplace. “The worldwide release of the Women’s Quick Facts is a must have resource and is mission critical to drive targeted enterprise growth enabled to broaden deeper female diversity among the STEM Talent pipeline and STEM workforce,” affirms Heidi Kleinbach-Sauter, SVP, Global R&D, PepsiCo.

Brooks M. Beveridge, 33, was sentenced by President Judge Fredric J. Ammerman to 18 months probation. He was ordered to have a mental health assessment and he is not permitted to possess a firearm. The charges stem from an incident at the Wal-Mart store in Lawrence Township Feb. 7 when Beveridge was arguing with employees regarding an item he was trying to return. He told them he was an undercover police officer and showed them he was carrying a handgun. Prior to sentencing, Beveridge’s attorney, Brian Manchester, told the court that what Beveridge did was “extremely stupid” and he has no excuse for it. He then mentioned that Beveridge is a veteran who served in both Iraq and Afghanistan. Beveridge apologized for his actions and stated that not being able to have a gun is a big punishment for him. Manchester asked for a six-month probationary period. Assistant District Attorney Ben Baker responded, saying that six months probation would be too short of a time for this type of charge and asked for the maximum probationary sentence.

Tesco, which is recovering from an accounting scandal, revealed in a results statement that it had slashed net losses in the first half of its current financial year, and posted rising underlying earnings -- and its third successive quarter of sales growth -- after cutting prices. Investors were impressed, sending Tesco's share price soaring almost 10 percent in morning trade to top the risers' board on London's FTSE 100 index. The firm meanwhile repeated that it was cooperating with a British criminal probe after three former executives were charged last month with fraud and false accounting. In recent years, Aldi and its rival Lidl have boomed in Britain, grabbing valuable market share from traditional supermarkets Asda, Morrisons, Sainsbury's and Tesco, as customers tightened their belts to save money. Tesco said Wednesday it had axed prices by six percent since September 2014, in a key turnaround plan spearheaded by chief executive Dave Lewis. - Turnaround gathers pace - Lewis was parachuted into Tesco -- the world's third-biggest supermarket chain after France's Carrefour and global leader Walmart -- in July 2014 in a bid to turn around its fortunes at the group, which posted a record loss in 2014/2015. He has since launched a deep cost-cutting drive and sold a series of assets, and outlined fresh plans on Wednesday to slash costs by another Â£1.5 billion ($1.9 billion, 1.7 billion euros) over the next three years. "Tesco has invested heavily in reducing prices in the last two years, and has gradually reduced its customer exodus to the discounters Aldi and Lidl," said CMC Markets analyst Jasper Lawler. "Both the German chains are still rapidly gaining market share but less of it is coming from Tesco, with Walmart-owned Asda notably falling out of favour." At the same time, Tesco also faces a fast-changing landscape in Britain's supermarket sector. Sainsbury's completed its Â£1.4-billion purchase of Home Retail Group, owner of catalogue chain Argos, in early September. Morrisons has meanwhile forged a tie-up with Amazon to sell products on the US online giant's Prime service, while they are also available from online delivery service Ocado alongside those from upmarket supermarket chain Waitrose. "While Tesco continues to lose shopping trips to discounters such as Aldi and Lidl, it has managed to offset the decline by gaining share from other parts of the market, especially Asda," noted Himanshu Pal, vice president at Kantar Retail. "However, despite the improved performance, Tesco continues to face strong headwinds as competitors ramp up their capabilities -- for example Sainsbury's acquisition and subsequent integration of Argos, and Morrisons' partnerships with Amazon and Ocado." For its part, Aldi had announced last week that it would ramp up its British expansion, unaffected by the shock Brexit referendum, with a Â£300-million investment to revamp stores. - 'Playing discounters at own game' - ?Tesco is playing the discounters at their own game, cutting prices across much of their essentials range," added Philip Benton, analyst at consultancy Euromonitor International. "The retailer is still dealing with the threat posed by discounters Aldi and Lidl that will continue to eat up market share, impacting not only Tesco but its supermarket rivals too, due to their rapid UK expansion." Tesco added that net losses -- or losses after taxation -- narrowed sharply to Â£91 million in the 26 weeks to August 27, compared with Â£365 million a year earlier. Pre-tax profit however slid 28.3 percent to Â£71 million in the reporting period, hit partly by the impact of price cutbacks. In home market Britain, sales excluding petrol on a like-for-like basis -- which strips out the impact of new floor space -- surged 0.9 percent in the second quarter. That was the third straight quarterly expansion. Turning to Brexit, Tesco acknowledged there would be "risks and uncertainties" arising from Britain's looming EU exit -- but said there would not be a "material adverse impact on the group's results" in the current financial year.

Brooks M. Beveridge, 33, was in the Clearfield store in February when he began arguing with employees about returning an item, according to court records. After he became upset, he flashed a handgun and claimed to be an undercover police officer. On Monday Beveridge pleaded guilty to impersonating a public servant and was sentenced to 18 months’ probation by Judge Fredric J. Ammerman. As part of his sentence, he will have to undergo a mental health assessment. He was also ordered not to have a firearm. Beveridge, whose attorney stated was a veteran that served in both Iraq and Afghanistan, said that not being able to have a firearm was the worst part of his punishment. He apologized to the court for his actions. According to the affidavit of probable cause, an employee told police that on Feb. 7 a man, later identified as Beveridge approached her at the customer service desk and asked to return batteries. After this, Beveridge then attempted to return an Apple TV worth approximately $199.99. She asked him for the receipt and he responded that he didn’t have one. He explained he had purchased the item from the State College Wal-Mart about two weeks ago. The employee attempted to run the serial number on the TV but it was hard to read and the device serial number did not match the number on the box which he had with him. When she told him she was unable to return the item, he became agitated, and she contacted the customer service manager. The manager told the man they could not make the return for the same reasons the other employee had stated to him. The first employee said Beveridge then opened his jacket to show them a gun that he had concealed in a brown leather shoulder holster. He said he was an undercover police officer; why would he lie about this? The employee told police this made her feel uncomfortable and she thought he did this to intimidate them. The employees then retrieved the store manager who told Beveridge the same thing. He opened his jacket again and told this manager that he was an undercover cop. When police asked this employee if he said anything else, she said Beveridge kept stating he needed money for gas and groceries for his children. He stated if they could just give him $100, and they told him they couldn’t do that. Then he said “just give me $10” as he needed money. He said they had to do something because this was their fault and not his. The customer service manager told police that she felt he was mentally unstable and was concerned about his actions. Because he told them he bought the TV in State College, she contacted that store and discovered they had not sold that item in the past two weeks. After he showed them his gun, she said she felt very uncomfortable and intimidated which is why she contacted her manager. Once all three employees told him he couldn’t return the item, he left on his own. They followed to make sure he went out of the store. The manager said he drove away in a black Nissan truck. He was able to give police the man’s driver’s license number, which was on the receipt for the return of the batteries. This led investigators to Beveridge. The officer checked all vehicles registered to Beveridge and found he did own a Nissan truck. He then checked with the Clearfield County Sheriff’s Department to determine if he had a permit to carry a concealed weapon and he did. The officer asked them to revoke his permit.

Xiaomi's 4K-capable Mi Box is the most affordable Android TV device yet Is this enough to make people care about Android TV? Ian Paul (TechHive (US)) on 05 October, 2016 01:59 0 - - - - print email Xiaomi just announced that its long-awaited Android TV streaming box is now available in the U.S. for $70. The new Mi Box comes loaded with Android TV 6.0 and will support 4K streaming at up to 60 frames per second. For HDR fans, the Mi Box will also support the HDR10 standard once Android 7.0, “Nougat” hits the new streaming player. Anyone interested in the Mi Box can pick it up from Mi’s online store right now, or Walmart.com in the coming days (though they've already been sprouting up at Walmart stores for over a week now). As this is an Android TV box it comes with the niceties you’d expect, including Android apps, Cast support, and Google voice search via the Mi Box’s voice remote. Gamers can also add a Mi Game Controller, though that accessory does not yet show up in Mi’s store. Xiaomi’s Mi Box. The tiny box itself features an unnamed 2GHz quad-core Cortex-A53 processor with 750MHz Mail 450 GPU. There’s also 2GB of RAM and a measly 8GB of eMMC onboard flash storage; the Mi Box supports expandable storage via the box’s single USB 2.0 port. Other notable specs include 802.11a/b/g/n/ac Wi-Fi with dual-band support for both 2.4GHz and 5GHz; Bluetooth 4.0; and a single HDMI 2.0a port with support for HDCP 2.2. The impact on you at home: One gander at the specs and it becomes pretty obvious why the Mi box is so much cheaper than previous runs at an Android TV set-top box. If you have any plans to use apps, for example, you’ll most definitely need to expand the Mi box’s storage capacity. Though the cheaper price might also overcome the biggest hurdle that Android TV streaming boxes have faced: nobody wants them. Razer’s Forge TV ceased sales after just six months, while Google’s Nexus Player was discontinued earlier in 2016 with no successor in sight. Only Nvidia’s Shield console remains as a competitor to the Mi Box, though Nvidia’s gaming focus probably has more to do with the Shield’s continued existence than anything else. At $70, the Mi Box might be more interesting for anyone looking for an “Androidy” equivalent to the Apple TV. But if you’re looking for pure streaming hardware it’s difficult to beat the value of Google’s Chromecast—especially with a 4K version expected to debut on Tuesday.

(WMT) became the largest retailer in the world. It has over 5,000 retail stores serving more than 260 million people across the globe every week. I believe the following six important strategies will transform the business over time. 1) Improving retail basics Price is definitely a powerful driver for consumers, but consumers from across the income spectrum expect clean and organized stores which stock their desired goods and can complete their shopping swiftly. If a retailer can deliver on all these requirements, consumers will feel good about their shopping and will return to that store frequently. Successful turnaround stories in retail, be it Dollar General Corp. (DG), Home Depot Inc (HD), or Family Dollar Stores, Inc. (FDO) have all been providing consumers with compelling and well-stocked merchandise in well-organized and clean stores. WMT’s initiative on its Clean, Fast, and Friendly scores is a strong step in the right direction. Image by / upload.wikimedia.org It is of greater significance considering the intense competition WMT faces. Management has rightly noted that even though it is not known how to grow a $500 billion per year business, they definitely know how to grow sales at a single store. These strong retail basics will certainly go a long way towards realizing that goal. 2) Continued investment in digital capabilities WMT is attempting to become the largest omni-channel retailer in the US. The company runs its e-commerce operations business from California and not from Bentonville, Arkansas. California is closer to Silicon Valley’s technology and this demonstrates the company’s views on the importance of e-commerce channel to WMT. I believe there is definitely a trade-off as the profitability levels are lower. However the company’s extensive investments in this channel and its willingness to incur over $1 billion in operating loss emphasize the long term importance of e-commerce channel for WMT in the long run. WMT’s online grocery offering continues to get high marks from customers. As it expands, WMT can take advantage of its vast physical footprint and become a market share leader in this growing category. 3) WMT is improving its private brand mix WMT has mixed success in its plans to push more private brands and exclusive relationships. For example, it had to phase out its Price first value brand and oats organic line. Despite this I believe private brand is an area where the company could be more aggressive and thoughtful. Success in private labels would not only help WMT in its competitive positioning against deep discounters (in particular on opening price points in grocery), but also help to subsidize margins. Margins in private labels tend to be several hundred bps higher as compared to nationally branded products. I also believe that efforts in theses segment along with exclusive tie-ups will help sustain demand for its brand and stores. A case in point is Target Corporation (TGT), where its exclusive tie-ups with fashion designers Missoni and Lilly Pulitzer have led to considerable success. WMT concentrates most of its private label efforts in opening price points, but it does not have to be so. A good example would be Home Depot which was able to create several $1 billion brands like Hampton Bay in ceiling fans and patio furniture as the competition is less intense from other national vendors. WMT’s increased focus on private brands, which is intended to defend against the hard discounters growing their store bases in the US. It is clear from company’s recent investment in its Innovation Center that there is a stepped up focus on improving the quality and quantity of private label SKUs. 4) Simplified portfolio Management has shown inclination to re-assess its portfolio as seen by the closure of several hundred stores. I believe WMT needs to further simplify its portfolio. In simple words, it is extremely difficult to be everything for everyone; the larger and more diverse the business, the harder it is to manage. I believe there is still immense scope to further simplify the company’s business. Investors would react positively to company’s more transformative approach like an asset sale or even something less drastic like additional store closures and reduced openings, as simplifying the portfolio could improve financial returns and free up additional cash to be distributed to shareholders 5) Cultural shift One of the hardest things to do is to change a company’s culture. A good example is when Home Depot decided to re-align and go back to its roots of being a customer service oriented company. It was not enough to just tell the store managers and staff to focus more on customer service to induce real change. Home Depot had to block access to online forms that had to be filled during parts of the day and went as far as cutting off e-mail to store managers. Otherwise this was essentially a waste of time for a store manager hanging out behind closed doors instead of being in aisle helping customers. This is an over simplification of the changes that occurred in Home Depot, but it signifies that the company had to think “out of the box” to initiate the changes it desired. Presence of store managers in the aisles helping the customers motivated the front line sales associates in doing the same and the phenomenon became contagious and spread around the store. WMT is making some progress, but a lot more to do. The company has already spent $2.7 billion over last two years as it increased wages to $10 per hour and added department staff. It is difficult to suggest what the company can do to drive behavioral changes, but the management needs to think creatively to alter its culture as was the case with Home Depot. 6) Lower profitability due to high competition Lower profitability is a necessary evil in the renewal process for WMT and its shareholders. The company has already reset its earnings downwards by 15-20% from 2014 levels. This I suspect might not be a onetime reset considering today’s fast-changing retail world. Best Buy Co Inc (BBY) had to go through a similar experience when it reduced its prices and had to accept lower gross margins when it tried re-gain market share against Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) and others. Kroger Co (KR) and other legacy grocery competitors have also been forced to consolidate and lower gross margins by over 200 bps to stay competitive. Not drawing a line on the profitability might frustrate investors, but on the flip side it would endanger WMT’s business model. It might lead to WMT being less price competitive, loose the customer service battle and also not sufficiently invest in building digital capabilities. No much upside at current levels WMT shares have only had minor correlations to the market over the last 15 years. WMT’s size (it’s 1.4% of the index) dictates that WMT shares have had at least some modest correlation with the S&P 500 over the last 15 years (correlation of ~0.75), but it’s clear that the link was much tighter in the late 1990s than it has been since. My 12-month price target of $75.05 are based on 16.5x 2016 EPS estimate of $4.55 (mid-point company guidance). This is above the 3-yr average of 14.5x, but the company is coming off a period of heavy investment spending and EPS revisions are starting to move up. What should investors do now? I advise investors to wait for stock to come down at least 5% and enter with long-term perspective. Published on Oct 4, 2016 By kiran Copyrighted 2016. Content published with author's permission.

(View our Privacy Policy) U-turns on Roosevelt Boulevard require caution Lorrie Lykins, Times Correspondent Link View all Articles LORRIE LYKINSTampa Bay Times Tuesday, October 4, 2016 4:55pm Print 0 My Edition I want to see more articles tagged I'm already following articles tagged Since they fixed up the Roosevelt Boulevard and Dodge Street area to accommodate Walmart, we now have a big problem at Dodge and Roosevelt. People are coming up to the light from the west to make U-turns and putting pedestrians and right-hand turners at risk. We desperately need a "No U-turn" sign. Please see what can be done before someone gets hurt or killed there. Related News/Archive Closure of Roosevelt Boulevard flyover in Clearwater further tangles Ulmerton Road traffic 5 Months Ago Dr. Delay: New configuration at Roosevelt Boulevard and Ulmerton Road is temporary 5 Months Ago Construction of elevated lanes on Gandy Boulevard right on schedule 4 Months Ago Joan Bichsel We passed your note along to the state Department of Transportation and Kevin Dunn, traffic services and signing pavement manager looked into this. The DOT studied the intersection and Dunn said last week that they did not find any record so far of U-turn-related crashes involving eastbound traffic moving westbound at Dodge. It's important to note that those making legal U-turns at this location have the right-of-way versus southbound traffic turning right on a red signal. Part of the consideration in weighing whether or not to allow U-turns is the ripple effect such restrictions have on traffic movement and patterns both upstream and downstream of the intersection. In this case it would mean forcing traffic to the next available median opening (basically relocating the issue). Part of the issue here is the likely increased U-turn volume as a result of drivers wanting to avoid the long traffic signal cycle and congestion at U.S. 19. Dunn said this could be the case, but that the cycle length of the traffic signals here needs to be long in order to move traffic effectively through this heavily traveled area. In addition, the Wawa store that opened in this location last year has added to the traffic volume, as does, as we all well know, the winter season and the influx of snowbirds. For now, no changes are planned, but it's worth mentioning that folks should be alert to the increased incidence of U-turns at Roosevelt Boulevard and Dodge Street. Can you provide an update on the construction at 38th Avenue N and 58th Street please? I remember reading it was scheduled to be completed by mid August, but here we are approaching mid October and it doesn't seem to be even close. I have a bet going on that the new Rally station at the corner of 66th Street and 46th Avenue N will be completed sooner. Steven Blanchard The intersection improvement project, which began in late June and has required lane closures, is scheduled to wrap up Oct. 28, according to the latest update provide by Pinellas County Public Works. Keep your fingers crossed. Barricade watch On Park Street at 54th Avenue N, the southbound curb lane is closed, as is the westbound left-hand turn lane, due to repair work to a damaged 36-inch reclaimed water supply line. Pinellas County Public Works cautioned last week that there may be the need to shift traffic lanes and there will definitely be delays as the repairs progress. Work is expected to last until approximately Oct. 21. Email Dr. Delay at docdelay@gmail.com to share your traffic concerns, comments, and questions. Follow @AskDrDelay.

(Photo: AP Photo/Dieu Nalio Chery) 204 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE On Sunday afternoon, I was at the Wal-Mart on U.S. 1 in Port St. Lucie, and I was freaking out. Hurricane Matthew was out there, somewhere, and I needed supplies. Where were the gas cans? Bottled water? Do we have enough flashlights? How about batteries? Is it possible to buy them by the pallet? And yet I was alone. The other shoppers, at that moment, all seemed nonchalant. As if there wasn’t this giant, terrifying storm eyeing us up. There were large stacks of hurricane supplies on display, but they looked untouched. No one appeared to be stockpiling provisions. What’s wrong with these people? Or maybe they’ve seen it all before. After all, all but one of the “spaghetti” models at that point showed the storm staying east of the coast. Sure, things could change. But calm down, ya newbie, wouldja? TCPALM Hurricane Matthew | Live blog By 5 p.m. Monday the track had changed, and my hysteria was validated. Ha! See? The early bird gets the supplies! But wait. Maybe I hadn’t gotten enough. So Tuesday afternoon I hightailed it over to the Home Depot in Stuart looking for another gas can. Fat chance. Instead, I stopped off at Winn-Dixie for some essentials: red wine and fried chicken (don’t ask). Everyone seemed in a good mood as they loaded their carts with bottled water. And I thought: That’s Treasure Coast folks for you — genial even though they might be without air conditioning for the next two weeks. Dear readers, I’ve only been in Florida since December, and this is my first hurricane. In fact, I want to apologize because I feel like maybe I brought it with me. See, in my family there’s this thing called the “Smart luck,” which is to say, there’s no luck whatsoever. It’s entirely in character to move to a beautiful town that hasn’t seen a hurricane in 11 years, only to have one come roaring in on my heels. Indeed, I distinctly remember my mother's reaction when I told her I was moving to Florida. "Florida? They have hurricanes!" she said. Calm down, mother, I said. The Treasure Coast hasn't had a hurricane in more than a decade. So clearly, this is totally my fault. Back in Pennsylvania, at this very moment, mom is freaking out. That’s where I get my propensity to panic; it's genetic. To her credit, she hasn’t called yet. But it’s coming. “WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO???” she’ll ask. Do? Maybe I’ll surf the tidal wave. Barring that, we’ll put up the hurricane shutters, connect the generator as needed and ride this thing out, just like everybody else. Every region of the country has its own natural disasters. California issued an earthquake warning over the weekend. Move to the middle of the country, like Nebraska, and you’re dodging tornadoes. In the Northeast, it’s snow — last winter one storm dumped 35 inches on Pennsylvania. I was here in the balmy sunshine, while my wife and kids, who’d remained up north to sell the house, dug out. In Pennsylvania, you get a major snowstorm coming through and everyone rushes out to buy bread and milk. I was never sure why. What are they going to do, make French toast? (And don’t you need eggs for that, anyway?) But when Mother Nature’s bearing down, there’s no time for logic. Everyone else is buying bread and milk — maybe I should, too! Maybe there’s a time-tested reason people do this! Oh my god, save me some! So what's the local tradition? What am I supposed to be buying for a hurricane? We've got our bottled water, plenty of nonperishable food, everything on the TCPalm.com list. But surely there are other items that you, personally, have found indispensable in hurricane conditions. I mean, besides red wine and fried chicken. I'll admit I'm scared. This is a great unknown for me. Our house was built in 1976. It has been through hurricanes David, Irene, Frances, Jeanne and Wilma. The roof is relatively new. I'm reasonably confident it'll be OK... which, of course, are famous last words. The prospect of an extended power outage in the Florida heat, ugh. That's what the generator is for, though it won't run the air conditioning. We'll see. Which, again, is really all we can do. As I drove along Indian River Drive on Tuesday morning, the sky opened up, a tremendous blue, and it made me wonder how that sky could be so beautiful now, with something so menacing waiting in the wings. A storm like this makes you feel small and it occurs to me that people, mankind, have spent a millennia trying to subdue Mother Nature, and yet here we are, utterly at her mercy. May she be kind to you, and the entire Treasure Coast. Stay safe. Gil Smart is a columnist for Treasure Coast Newspapers and a member of the Editorial Board. His columns reflect his opinion.

Daniel B. Kline (TMFDankline) Oct 4, 2016 at 11:10AM Kmart has been closing locations, but its CEO says it will not be shutting down. Image source: Sears Holdings. There was a time when Sears dominated the retail space in the United States. The company had a massively successful catalog and a number of house brands that had a reputation for quality. Sears may never have been a sexy or trendy place to shop, but it was a steady pillar of many communities, anchoring malls while giving middle-class people a reasonable place to shop. Those days, however, have long since passed. The company's catalog shut down in 1993, made irrelevant first by the growth of Wal-Mart and now seemingly ridiculous in an internet-driven world. In fact, the early 1990s may have been the beginning of what has been a long slide for the chain. Sears has been struggling to find a business model that works in a world dominated by rivals including Wal-Mart and Amazon.com. Sears merged with Kmart in 2004, creating Sears Holdings (NASDAQ:SHLD), and it has been steadily losing money while getting smaller.  In April, it released plans to close 68 Kmart locations and 10 Sears stores that had been losing money. That followed over 100 locations split between the two brands that closed in 2015 and around 200 that shuttered the year before.  It's a trend that, coupled with ongoing losses and the company having to borrow money from a hedge fund controlled by CEO Eddie Lampert, makes it reasonable to consider whether Sears and Kmart may be on their way out. Most specifically, many shoppers have seen Kmarts closing around the country, leading to questions about whether that brand has a future. Lampert says it does and he has posted an impassioned message attempting to reassure consumers as the critical 2016 holiday season approaches. What the CEO is saying In a post on Sears Holdings' blog, Lampert laid out some of his strategy to revive both brands, pointing to a new partnership with Shop Your Way (an online shopping service owned by the company), Sears Auto Centers, and Uber as an example of how the company is being transformed. He also specifically addressed the rumors that Kmart would soon be shut down, calling them "frequent false and exaggerated claims." "Recent reports have suggested that Kmart will cease its operations. I can tell you that there are no plans and there have never been any plans to close the Kmart format," he wrote. "In fact, we've been working hard to make Kmart a more fun, engaging place to shop, powered by our integrated retail innovations and Shop Your Way. To report or suggest otherwise is irresponsible and is likely intended to do harm to our company to the benefit of those who seek to gain advantage from posting these inaccurate reports." Lampert noted that Kmart still has over 700 locations, with a "significant number" of them already achieving profitability. He explained that the company's goal is to improve the performance of unprofitable stores, but he did acknowledge that any locations that could not be improved would be closed. "... we have been clear that we are intent on improving the performance of our unprofitable stores and, if we cannot, we will close them. Actions to improve our store productivity, including reducing inventory stored in the stockrooms, are designed to make our stores easier to operate and to eliminate unproductive inventory and processes," he wrote. "Decisions to close stores are never easy, but we recognize that the way people are shopping is changing significantly. This is why we have made major investments in our online and mobile platforms and this is why our focus on serving members through Shop Your Way is so important." Not done yet While there have been numerous media reports suggesting that Sears Holdings will close Kmart or shut down entirely, it's worth noting that the company still has considerable assets. That includes a large amount of real estate as well as house brands including Craftsman Tools, Kenmore appliance, and DieHard car products. "We have a process under way to create value by positioning our Kenmore, Craftsman and DieHard businesses as well as our Sears Home Services business to benefit from broader distribution and partnerships that will allow them to grow beyond Sears Holdings," Lampert wrote. "We also possess a significant portfolio of real estate assets with an opportunity to create value through improving our retail productivity and by monetizing them in a variety of ways." The CEO was clear that the company would be aggressive in closing locations where it can't make money, but he also made it clear the chain expects to continue to operate, even if its focus shifts. "We expect to end up with a large chain of stores, some owned and some leased, but with a company focused on serving members broadly through Shop Your Way rather than exclusively or predominantly through our stores," he wrote. "Our stores remain extremely important to our future, but as part of an overall focus on serving our Shop Your Way members." Daniel Kline has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Source: JCSD JONES COUNTY, MS (WDAM) - A pregnant Jones County woman was charged with possession after she was caught selling pills in a Walmart parking lot, according to the sheriff.  Jones County sheriff deputies received a tip that Tiffney Dement, 32, or Laurel, would be attempting to sell 20 hydrocodone pills in the parking lot of Walmart in laurel.  When investigators arrived they found Dement walking through the lot with something in her hand.  Investigators approached her and asked her what she was doing. According to the sheriff, Dement said she lost her car and was looking for it, even though she was standing right beside it.  She admitted to having 20 loose hydrocodone pills on her, and told investigators she was taking the tabs to her car because they were "melting" inside of the store.  Dement was arrested and then transported to the Jones County Sheriff's Department. During the interview, she admitted to attempting to sell the pills at the store and said she had stolen them from her grandmother.  Dement also admitted to deputies that she had used methamphetamine, marijuana and hydrocodone with the last week. Dement is six months pregnant.  She was charged with felonious child abuse and possession of a controlled substance with the intent to deliver.  She is expected to be in court Tuesday for her initial appearance.  Copyright WDAM 2016.

Walmart’s decision to drop out of the Mission Gateway plan and reinvest in its Roeland Park store was hailed Monday as “the most exciting news in years” by that city’s mayor. “It certainly provides us a whole lot more assurance we won’t be losing that tax money,” said Roeland Park Mayor Joel Marquardt. FROM OUR SPONSORS: A Walmart spokeswoman said the company plans to make a “significant capital investment” in the store at 5150 Roe Ave. Work is expected to begin in early 2017. “We expect to do a more intensive remodeling not just paint and new fixtures,” said Delia Garcia. “We’ll be modernizing to align with our current branding.” The store will remain open during construction, Marquardt said. Walmart has been at its current Roeland Park location for 20 years and is a major source of revenue for the city, responsible for an estimated $700,000 in sales tax each year between it and businesses it influences. Ever since the possibility of the store relocating to Mission Gateway was raised five years ago, city officials have been preparing for the potential loss to its budget. The city council in 2013 approved a property tax increase that was intended to compensate for the loss of Walmart revenues. It projected a 35 percent loss of sales tax revenue in 2018 and 40 percent loss in 2019. Even after Walmart agreed to extend its lease at 5150 Roe another five years last May, officials said they were continuing to operate under the assumption it ultimately would be gone. Now, Jodi Belpidio, one of the owners of the property where Walmart is located in Roeland Park, believes the door may be open again to pitch the retail giant on expanding at the site. “We have over the years offered to allow them to expand, but there’s been so much movement in Walmart real estate it never went anywhere,” Belpidio said. “Hopefully it might be considered now. “They needed to take Gateway as far as they could before they could reach out to us.” The property controlled by Belpidio and her partners where Walmart is located also includes a CVS pharmacy, a retail strip mall and a Taco Bell. Garcia said the current 112,000 square-foot store in Roeland Park limits what her firm can do with the space, including expanding its grocery offerings. The store proposed for Mission Gateway would have been 155,000 square-feet. “The Roeland Park store will continue to be a Walmart discount store and not the super store as planned for Mission,” she said. As for prospects for another super store location, Garcia responded, “we’re always looking for opportunities to better serve our customers.” Belpidio described the news of Walmart remaining as good for Roeland Park and Mission. Tom Valenti, the Mission Gateway developer, said his firm is searching for potentially three retailers to occupy the space that had been set aside for Walmart. “It’s awesome,” Belpidio said. “We’d love to see them spruce up the place and reinvest, it’s been neglected while they were trying to figure out Gateway.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Mi Box Android TV now avialable on Xiaomi’s official website By Ida Torres - October 4, 2016 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter A few days ago, a Walmart employee may have accidentally placed Xiaomi’s Mi Box on sale, as it was not supposed to be officially released until this month. Well, that is now official (and hopefully they didn’t get fired) as the Xiaomi official website is now carrying the device, and you can get it for, as expected, below $100. For just twice the amount of a Chromecast at $69, you now get your own Android TV device to watch your videos on a larger screen. Because of that mistake and also various leaks and rumors, we basically know a lot about the Mi Box already. It is powered by a quad-core ARM processor and has 2GB of RAM and 8GB of internal storage but can be expanded through a USB flash drive. It has an HDMI port that can output 4K video at 60fps to your TV. It comes with Android 6.0 Marshmallow out of the box. It also comes with a slim remote control that has a built-in microphone so you can order your Mi Box around through voice controls, kind of what the Apple TV does. It will also be selling a separate game controller because one of the joys of having an Android TV box is that you can play games as well on a larger screen, and you can even play against or with your friends. The Xiaomi Mi Box is now available for purchase on the official website for just $69. It will start shipping out by October 6. You can also just wait for it to be available at local retailers, since Walmart obviously will have it soon.

The company launched in the San Francisco Bay area and in Los Angeles in early 2015 and announced plans to expand to D-FW earlier this year. Related Link: App-based home health provider plans to enter D-FW market In August, Honor gained $42 million in Series B funding led by Thrive Capital, a venture capital investment firm focused on internet and software products.  To date the company has raised $62 million in venture capital funding, which it plans to use to expand operations. The first pilot locations in Texas are inside Wal-Mart Supercenters on Tarrant Parkway in North Richland Hills and U.S. Highway 287 in Arlington.  Consumers can visit those sites to try out the app and receive free in-store consultations on their home care needs.  Honor home-health staff demonstrate use of the company's app, which the company's founders have described as the Uber of home health. (Smiley N. Pool/The Dallas Morning News) Staff Photographer They can also schedule a more detailed in-home assessment for $39.99, which will be applied to care hours if the individual decides to move forward with using the service. Care provided through Honor is considered to be “non-medical,” and therefore is not reimbursed by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.  Non-medical home care often includes things like bathing, meal preparation and housekeeping. Medicare does, however, reimburse for services such as occupational therapy, intravenous injections and rehabilitation, which are provided in the home by licensed medical professionals. Spending on those services reached $83.2 billion in the U.S. in 2014, most of which was paid by the federal health insurance provider.  There are more than 2,600 certified agencies that can offer home care to Medicare patients in Texas. To cut down on fraud, the CMS announced earlier this year that it will be testing a new payment structure in five states, including Texas.  The start date for that rollout remains undetermined.  Based on a similar demo launched in Illinois in August, the CMS said additional education efforts may be needed before expansion to the other states. Related link: Texas home health care providers will soon face extra scrutiny to prevent fraud Honor said it is too early to discuss opening additional locations but said more are possible. "We are finding that many Wal-Mart families who stop in are caregivers with older adults living in the home," said Kathryn Parsons, general manager of Honor DFW.   The intent of the pilot sites is "to be a convenient stop where the local community can come learn how to help their loved ones stay healthy and safe as they age in their own homes," she said. Honor is also seeking to hire "hundreds" to join its workforce and fill vacant sales and aide positions in Dallas, Tarrant, Denton and Collin counties.  Wages are expected to be “higher than industry average,” starting at about $13 an hour in North Texas for a full-time home care aide, the company told The Dallas Morning News.   View Comments Tags Health Care Business Share Facebook Twitter Email Print This Story Get the Most Important D-FW News in Your Inbox Sign up for our daily email newsletters Get Headlines, Business, SportsDay, and GuideLive.

Developer Tom Valenti’s announcement to the Shawnee Mission Post on Monday that Walmart had pulled out of the long-stalled Mission Gateway project could mark a major turning point for the development. A contentious point for many in the neighborhood, Walmart’s presence at the site was also seen as problematic for Roeland Park, which stood to lose its Walmart store when the new one opened.

At worst, they feel like a sterile strip-mall dental office or a dimly lit Walmart. But Maryam Mirnateghi wants to change that. Her new store, Canna West Seattle, set to open in October, is housed in a 1920s Craftsman-style house on California Avenue Southwest and will be worlds away from those impersonal pot shops. "It's going to be clean and classy, but it's not going to be pretentious," Mirnateghi says. "It's going to be really cozy and very different from the other stores we have in the city." She hired an architect and a designer, she says, "to help keep the charm of the house. It has some amazing old woodwork inside." More importantly, Mirnateghi wants Canna West Seattle to be a resource for social education about cannabis. Her aim is to help Seattleites become more informed about the plant's myriad uses and to dispel myths about its effects still lingering from the anti-marijuana age of Reefer Madness. When the store opens, she hopes neighbors will treat swinging by Canna West Seattle with the same normalcy as grabbing a latte from C&P Coffee Company, which sits just around the corner. Mirnateghi, who previously had another pot business, has spent the past five years navigating the complex world of Washington State retail cannabis licensing. Last December, she closed down Fusion, the medical cannabis dispensary she opened in 2011. There, Mirnateghi says, she had a dedicated clientele, some of whom were distraught when they got word of Fusion’s demise. "It was super sad. We had a ton of regulars," she says. "When someone comes in to chat with us for a half an hour or even five minutes once a week, we have a relationship with them." The building that housed the dispensary, which was just blocks away from the western shore of Lake Union, was scheduled to be torn down. In addition to closing, Mirna­teghi, along with other medical dispensary owners, nearly lost their retail store licenses from the Washington State Liquor and Cannabis Board. The agency had limited the number of permits available for businesses transitioning from being medical dispensaries to recreational shops, as mandated by state law. Thankfully, Mirnateghi was able to keep one of her three retail licenses. Although she knew reopening in another spot in downtown Seattle would be more profitable, she made the risky decision to open a store in the Junction, a neighborhood in the heart of West Seattle. "For selfish reasons, I wanted to be the one to open a store there just because I feel like I could make one that fit the community very well," says Mirnateghi, who has lived in the Lincoln Park neighborhood for the last 12 years. Finding home Mirnateghi, who is the child of Iranian immigrants, worked as a corporate real-estate consultant before she was a cannabis entrepreneur. Although she smoked recreationally, Mirnateghi says she didn't become familiar with medical cannabis until her fiancé's grandmother was battling ovarian cancer, and the only medicine that seemed to help her manage the side effects of chemotherapy was a cannabis tincture. When she and her fiancé tried to find stores that supplied the tincture, they found budtenders weren't always knowledgeable about the medical uses for their products. "You'd go into one store and the guy would be like, 'I don't know. They all get you high,'" Mirnateghi says. Although Mirnateghi and her fiancé eventually found a store in which a worker was able to explain the uses for the different products that were available, she says she was startled that some medical shop workers had little knowledge of what they were selling. "Had it not been for a medical purpose for Grandma, I probably would've never seen the gap in the industry," she says. "There was a lot of room for improvement, but a lot of demand as well." In the end, she says, she knew she could help make the industry better. To start, she served on the board of the Coalition for Cannabis Standards and Ethics, which works closely with policy-makers, and later opened Fusion. She is an unabashed West Seattle fangirl and wanted to stay in the neighborhood. Two other newly licensed stores, Northwest Patient Resource Center and Origins plan to open up further south in Roxhill and White Center, respectively. In addition to the weed store, she is planning to open a glass store, which will sell pipes and other paraphernalia, across the street. A community resource For Mirnateghi, Canna West Seattle is an opportunity to bring something new to her community and connect with her neighbors. "It's about access," she says. "There's a lot of people in West Seattle, based on the phone calls I'm getting, who want us to open as soon as possible." While "mainland" Seattleites treat West Seattle as though it's another country, Mirnateghi says that, between Alki Beach–goers and foodies wanting to catch up with their friends, she's confident people will swing by Canna West Seattle during their trip. Mirnateghi is working on getting two other cannabis retail licenses and plans to open up other recreational shops throughout the city. But, she says, Canna West Seattle is still going to be home. "I'm being so protective of it," she says. "I want to make a pot shop that the neighborhood is going to embrace and love." 1 You might also be interested in these: The All-American Weed Family Sustainable, Sunshine-Raised Cannabis Joins the Fold of This Eastern Washington Clan by Ana Sofia Knauf Why Seattle Is Failing at Pot Tourism The City's Regulatory Restrictions Are Partially a Result of Washington's New Law Eliminating the Medical Marijuana Market by Tobias Coughlin-Bogue Seattle to Lose One of Its Few Minority-Owned Pot Businesses Even Though the Mayor Tried to Get the State to Get Its Act Together by Tobias Coughlin-Bogue Most Commented in News Trump Might Not Stop Legalization, but the Pot Industry Might Become Whiter We're Fucked Fuck Fuck Fucking Fuck.

Breaking News State Drops Murder Charge Against Man Accused In December Killing David OwensContact Reporter The state has dropped a murder charge against a man accused of shooting and killing a man last December on Griswold Street. Zachary Alexander, 26, has been jailed since his arrest in January on charges of murder, criminal possession of a firearm and conspiracy to sell marijuana. Prosecutor Anthony Bochicchio told Hartford Superior Court Judge Julia D. Dewey that two men, including Edison Burge, 22, made arrangements to buy marijuana from Alexander. First, however, they stopped at the Wal-Mart store on Flatbush Avenue and bought a BB gun. When they went to complete the marijuana deal shortly after 4 p.m. Dec. 12, 2015, Burge pulled the BB gun and the pair tried to rob Alexander. Alexander, who was carrying a real gun, drew his pistol and opened fire, fatally wounding Burge, said Walter D. Hussey of Hartford, Alexander's defense attorney. "It appeared to him to be a real weapon so he responded in kind," Hussey said Wednesday. Hussey said he planned to raise a self-defense claim at trial. Bochicchio told the judge that he did not believe he could win a conviction for murder at trial because self-defense would be a significant issue. Alexander, as part of a plea agreement, pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a firearm and will be sentenced to five years in prison and five years of special parole on Dec. 7. Hussey said the man who joined Burge in the attempted robbery told essentially the same story to police about what led to the shooting and that only strengthened Alexander's self-defense claim.

Ogg October 5, 2016 12:20 pm EST Print Email Tweet The rise in the dollar store theme was supposed to be secular. As consumers have been looking for any and every way to save money, dollar stores started pursuing a “reaching” approach — selling goods that were not just $1 any longer, say to the $5 and $10 per item. This was often coming at the expense of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE: WMT). 24/7 Wall St. has tracked the rise of dollar stores. This theme has run into some issues in recent months, but one such issue may have been that the stocks of Dollar General Corp. (NYSE: DG) and Dollar Tree Inc. (NASDAQ: DLTR) had risen too much. we even named Dollar General as being one of 10 stocks to own for the whole decade. Several years ago, we showed how the dollar stores were taking handily from Wal-Mart, showing that they were at the same stage as Wal-Mart was in back in the 1990s. Still, we also surmised that the dollar stores would never equate to Wal-Mart. Now Wal-Mart is fighting back and the Dow Jones Industrial Average stock — oh, and the world’s largest retailer — is fighting back to recapture retail market share. One key issue to consider is that Wal-Mart’s performance has been stellar in 2016. Sure, that was after a dismal 2015. Wal-Mart is the third best Dow stock so far in 2016 with a 19.5% gain. Now look at Dollar Tree and Dollar General: the former is down 1% so far in 2016 and latter is down 4%. From their 52-week highs, Dollar General is down a sharp 30% and Dollar Tree is down 24%. Now consider the market caps and expected revenues in relative positions. Wal-Mart, again as the world’s largest retailer, is worth a whopping $223 billion, with expected revenue of $487 billion this year. Dollar General is worth $19 billion in market cap, with an expected $22.1 billion in revenue this year, and Dollar Tree is worth almost $18 billion, with expected revenues of $20.9 billion. Analysts have been playing up Wal-Mart so far in 2016. Some of these calls feel late after a serious recovery. They also have been rather negative on the top dollar stores. October 5 brought a positive view from Credit Suisse on Wal-Mart, reiterating its Outperform rating and its $80 price target. That would imply upside of 11.5% just in capital gains, plus another 2.7% in dividend yields. Credit Suisse said that Wal-Mart’s upcoming analyst meeting will be a key data point for staples retail. The firm sees management updating several “billion dollar price cut initiatives” and cutting costs sooner than expected. On the theme of Dollar Stores in general, Credit Suisse sees both Dollar Tree and Dollar General as unlikely to leave the penalty box anytime soon. They expect Wal-Mart’s analyst day to be a negative for those dollar stores as well. Intensifying competition, grocery competition, accelerated promotions (that means discounts and sales) and even the fading impact of cheaper gas are all wearing on these companies. Credit Suisse believes that consensus estimates still seem too high for both of these formerly high-flying names, with comparable sales and margins under pressure. They said that Dollar Tree’s stock seems to offer additional downside as it becomes more evident that the Family Dollar turnaround will prove challenging. On Dollar Tree, Credit Suisse kept its Underperform rating and the firm cut its target price to $69 from $76. Dollar Tree pays no dividend, and it has about $7.3 billion in long-term debt. Dollar General is said to have risk also, but Credit Suisse believes that risk now looks largely washed out. Dollar General’s rating was maintained as Neutral, but the target price was lowered to $70 from $80. I'm interested in the Newsletter Get Newsletter terms and conditions   Credit Suisse shows that the staples retail competition in general is clearly another issue. They also see the low income benefits now lapping as well. The report said: Dollar stores compete with all staples retailers.

(CPSC) HAZLETON, Pa. (WOOD) — Sargent Art is recalling 2.8 million packages of craft paint that may contain harmful bacteria. The recalled paint was sold between May 2015 and June 2016 at Hobby Lobby, Wal-Mart and other stores nationwide and online at Amazon.com and on the company’s website. The Pennsylvania-based company issued the voluntary recall Tuesday, saying the bacteria the paint may harbor poses risk of serious illness in people with compromised immune systems. However, the Consumer Product Safety Commission says healthy consumers are generally not affected by the bacteria and no complaints have been reported. Sargent Art is recalling 13 types of paint in all colors and sizes, including: Art-Time Tempera Paint Art-Time Washable Finger Paint Art-Time Washable Fluorescent Finger Paint Art-Time Washable Fluorescent Tempera Paint Art-Time Washable Glitter Finger Paint Art-Time Washable Paint Fluorescent Tempera Paint Liquid Tempera Paint Supreme Tempera Paint Value Tempera Paint Washable Finger Paint Washable Glitter Paint Washable Tempera Paint Consumers with the recalled paints should immediately stop using it and contact Sargent Art for a full refund at 800.827.8081 during regular business hours or on the company’s website.

We think Maritimers are ready' By Brian Higgins, CBC News Posted: Oct 05, 2016 7:00 PM AT Last Updated: Oct 05, 2016 7:00 PM AT Walmart will start charging five cents for a plastic bag in its Maritime stores on Oct. 17. (Brian Higgins/CBC) Related Stories Paying for plastic: Walmart to start charging for plastics bags in Maritimes Walmart to stop taking Visa in Canadian stores Fitting rooms eliminated at Charlottetown Walmart Island Waste Management Corporation is applauding Walmart's move to start charging five cents for plastic bags, but some customers aren't convinced. Walmart to charge 5 cents for plastic bags in Maritime stores Walmart will start charging five cents for a bag in its Maritimes stores on Oct. 17. The company says the five-cent bags will be 25 per cent thicker and 25 per cent bigger than the thin disposable bags currently provided for free as part of a multi-year effort to eventually reduce all food and plastic waste at its stores to zero. "We're asking customers to change their habits," said Alex Roberton, senior director of corporate affairs for Walmart Canada. "The environmental ethic in the Maritimes has deep roots. We think Maritimers are ready." For the next few months Walmart will also sell a sturdy re-usable tote bag for 25 cents. 'A good thing,' says Island Waste Management Island Waste Management predicts that will lead to a 15 to 20 per cent reduction in plastic bag waste. "Anytime that any organization can implement programs to encourage people to re-use and not use new materials, I think is a good thing," said Gerry Moore, CEO of Island Waste Management Corporation. Island Waste Management expects to see a significant reduction in plastic bag waste after the fee is implemented. (Brian Higgins/CBC) Some shoppers skeptical, others supportive But in the Walmart parking lot on Wednesday, shoppers offered a mixed bag of opinions. "I don't like it and I'll probably go somewhere else," said John Ferguson. "Little bit of an overkill, wouldn't you think?" said Frank Clark. "I don't think they need to charge for bags." "I always carry a cloth bag in my car," said Frank Duguay:  "It's a matter of remembering to take it in." Walmart will be selling re-usable bags for 25 cents for the next few months. (Brian Higgins/CBC) "We've been paying for our plastic bags for a long time now," said Dawn Klok, a tourist from Australia. "I think you can't do anything better because the ocean's just full of plastic." Recycling bags costly One of Walmart's competitors on P.E.I., Atlantic Superstores, started charging for plastic bags a few years ago, but discontinued the practice. Island Waste Management Corporation says waste plastic was significantly reduced while the fee was being charged. "It reduced plastic bag waste we were shipped off Island by about 15 to 20 tractor trailer loads a year," said Moore. Moore said recycling of plastic bags is costly, and corporation often has to store the bags in heavy bailed bundles for extended periods while seeking overseas buyers. MORE P.E.I.

Millions Of Bottles Of Craft Paint Sold At Hobby Lobby, Walmart Recalled For Bacteria Contamination Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Millions Of Bottles Of Craft Paint Sold At Hobby Lobby, Walmart Recalled For Bacteria Contamination October 5, 2016 4:51 pm EST By Ashlee Kieler@akieler no painting today recall paint bacteria an odd recall so much paint consumer product safety commission When you think of all the items that can recalled for being tainted by bacteria, “craft paint” is probably pretty low on that list. But if you’ve got some tempera paint sitting around the house or schoolroom for craft time, you’ll want to check to make sure it’s not included in a new, massive recall. Sargent Art announced this week the recall of 2.8 million units of craft paint sold at national retailers like Walmart, Hobby Lobby, and Amazon after finding the products may be contaminated with harmful bacteria. According to a notice posted with the Consumer Product Safety Commission, exposure to the unspecified bacteria could have adverse health effects in immunocompromised individuals, posing a risk of serious illness through infection. Sargent Art says that the high level of bacteria — which is not harmful to healthy individuals — was discovered during routine testing. In all, the recall involves 13 types of Sargent Art Tempera and Finger Paints in different colors and sizes sold from May 2015 to June 2016. So far, the company is unaware of any injuries or illnesses related to the recalled products. Still, customers are urged to immediately stop using the past and contact Sargent Art for a full refund.

Walmart and Amazon have already pulled the "Tranny Granny" costume from their website. The costume's description reads: "All the guys will be dressing up as superheroes and princes but you'll stand out among the rest in this hilarious Granny men's costume!" Though the two sites pulled the costume which was being sold from third party vendor, Rasta Imposta, other sites like Spirit Halloween and even Target are still selling it under a different moniker. Walmart released a statement saying in part that it is appalled the seller put it on the site to begin with.

New ‘Trust Seal’ Study) Jamie Appleseed · October 5, 2016 “People have lost everything you know, so I always check a 100 times before I purchase anything”, one of our test subject explained as she meticulously entered her credit card information. Indeed, during our past 7 years worth of large-scale checkout usability testing, we have observed that users continue to feel uneasy about sharing their payment information with e-commerce sites. In fact, our new Checkout Usability study reveals that 18% of users have abandoned a checkout flow during the last 3 months because they “didn’t trust the site with their credit card information” (1,044 respondents, average US adult internet population, 2016). Throughout all of our testing of checkout processes, we’ve consistently observed 2 important user behaviors relating to security: Depending on the design, users perceive some parts of a page to be more secure than other parts of the same page. The average user’s perception of a site’s security is largely determined by their “gut feeling”, which – beyond how much they trust the brand – is to a large extent observed to be directed by how visually secure the page looks. In this article we’ll dive deeper into how visual security is best established, how users perceive security in a checkout flow, and we’ll provide new updated results for our “Which Site Seal do People Trust the Most?” study (incl. testing a fake seal). Users’ Perceived Level of Security in a Checkout Flow Already back in 2009 we observed that a large proportion of users perceive some parts of a checkout page to be more secure than other parts of the same page. This was re-verified in 2012. And now again, in 2016, in our latest large-scale checkout usability testing. The test subjects generally had less confidence in the security of their credit card details on pages where the credit card form didn’t “look” or “feel” more secure than the rest of the form fields used for less sensitive information. An example of Macy’s is seen here – notice how the credit card fields and address fields look exactly the same. What we consistently observe is that any parts of a checkout page with trust badges, reassuring microcopy and a general visual “robustness” are often perceived as being “more secure”, while parts without these visual clues inspire less confidence – despite the fact that these fields are all part of the same form on the same page. Now, from a technical perspective, this of course doesn’t make any sense, as all the form fields on an HTTPS-page are equally encrypted. However, the majority of normal web-users do not have this level of technical insight, and are likely to perceive some parts of the checkout page as more secure than others, whether it’s technically true or not. There’s two additional observations on users’ perceived security that are important to underscore: We observe the test subjects to exhibit little to no security concerns during checkout steps that only ask for address, shipping methods, contract info, and similar. The security concerns arise as users are confronted with the credit card interface. We see that when testing sites from large brands (i.e. Apple, Microsoft, Walmart) users have few security concerns, even with a minimum of “visual security” simply because they are large corporations and well-known brands (although they are still highly vulnerable to layout bugs). By contrast, when testing sites that are newer, less well-known, or more niche than these major brands, we have however observed users raise security concerns very easily if there are no visual clues. Hence, the more well-known a site or brand is, the less “visual security emphasis” clues are needed. Let’s take a look at some design tactics that have performed particularly well during our usability testing when it comes to reinforcing the user’s perceived level of security. Visually Reinforce the Credit Card Section One method we consistently observe to perform well for increasing users’ perceived security of sensitive fields is to visually encapsulate them. This can be achieved simply by using borders, background colors, shading, and other visual styling that will make one part of the form seem more robust than the rest. Remember: this is about perceived security of the fields, not their actual technical security. While from a technical security perspective it’s non-sense, note how NewEgg and Crate & Barrel visually reinforce their credit card fields using a style not used for any prior form fields – adding an extra degree of visual robustness to them. This mockup we created illustrates how a payment form may emphasize its security through visual cues such as microcopy, the use and position of site seals, a padlock icon, along with a visual encapsulation of the sensitive credit card fields via a grey background color. It’s important to note that the visual reinforcement must be distinct and unique for the credit card fields. If you use a similar style elsewhere during your checkout form for less sensitive information, it will likely be considered generic styling and not yield the desired increase in user confidence. Again, this is about tapping into the user’s perception of the fields, making the user feel that this highly sensitive information will be treated more securely than the fields that contain less sensitive information (like an address or name). Which Site Seal do People Trust the Most? (2016 Results) Another visual clue that during testing also proved effective at increasing the perceived level of security (and adding robustness to the encapsulation) is the use of “site seals”, such as trust badges, SSL seals, and similar symbols suggesting trustworthiness. Now there is a broad range of site seals, each with different meanings: SSL seals – Some are “SSL seals” which are issued by SSL certificate vendors – like Norton, Thawte, Trustwave, Geotrust, Comodo, etc., and these seals indicate that communication between your browser and the site is encrypted via the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol. In short: it denotes technical security. Trust seals – Others are “trust seals”, like Google Trusted Store, BBB Accredited, TRUSTe. These seals typically indicate some sort of verification of the site and its business – in other words, a trusted 3rd-party (like Google, TRUSTe, etc) saying “this is a legit business”. In short: it typically denotes business authenticity. Made up symbols – Finally there are visual symbols that aren’t issued by a 3rd-party and are simply “homemade” icons like padlocks or “Secure Checkout” badges. These are effectively visual symbols the site utilizes to make its own claims of security. In short: it’s entirely made up; the site claiming that it is safe. Generally, we see during testing that adding any visual icon will help increase the user’s general level of perceived security. However, we wanted to look a little deeper into which seals and icons inspire the highest level of confidence in users, and we’ve therefore conducted two quantitative studies testing various site seals. We ran the first study in 2013 and then the second in 2016, both asking the same question: “Which badge gives you the best sense of trust when paying online?” The 2016 test results tell largely the same story as our 2013 results. The SSL seal from Norton dominates as the seal that establishes the best sense of trust, followed by three trust seals, with several of the SSL seals performing rather low. Looking at the results, it’s very interesting to note that the seals from well-known consumer-facing brands, like Norton and Google, perform very well. This suggests that it’s at least to some extent possible for e-commerce sites to leverage the recognizability of these brands. Similar to the 2013 results, it’s interesting to see that the majority of the most trusted seals are “trust seals”, not SSL seals. This is noteworthy because SSL seals suggest actual technical security of the payment form (preventing man-in-the-middle attacks and network eavesdropping), whereas the trust seals indicate little to no actual technical security. Again, this just re-emphasizes that actual technical security is beyond most users’ understanding, and that users will go with what makes them feel most secure. .. the homemade seal performed significantly better than the SSL seals issued by established vendors .. In our 2016 tests we also included a completely “homemade / fake” seal not issued by a 3rd party, with no meaning whatsoever beyond the icon itself. Note how the homemade seal performed significantly better than the SSL seals issued by established vendors except Norton. This suggests that beyond strong brand reconizability, it doesn’t matter too much which actual seal is chosen. Rather what’s most important is making sure there’s some kind of visual seal or icon present to indicate the robustness of the credit card fields. Similar to fake site seals, padlock icons – such as those seen here from Sephora, Etsy, and Nike – are also observed to be part of the toolbox in lifting the user’s perceived level of security (again, despite being entirely made up and not denoting any actual technical security or business legitimacy). When it comes to placement of the seals and icons, we observe that placing 1-2 icons within the encapsulated area performs well to help the perceived reinforcement of the sensitive fields. Layout Quirks Erode User Trust While users’ general lack of deep technical knowledge means we can strengthen the perceived security of the credit card fields through visual cues, even entirely made-up ones, we also observe in testing that this lack of technical understanding can cause unrelated layout quirks to completely erode all sense of security. “This looks a bit strange. Especially when you are about to pay”, a subject explained during testing of Foot Locker’s mobile site, “This makes you think of some phishing or whatever.” Layout bugs can make some users believe the site may have been hacked and are thus particularly critical when they appear on key pages and paths (such as the checkout process). In practice we observe layout bugs on most major sites – to the right is Microsoft’s checkout. During testing we observe how seemingly innocent layout bugs and quirky interactive features cause the test subjects to doubt the security of the site. In fact, some subjects even believed the site had been hacked or wasn’t currently working properly, causing them to abandon their purchase due to a lack of trust in the site. In these instance even the strongest of brands can suffer since the user no longer trusts that the business has control over the site, and indeed we’ve seen subjects abandon sites such as Amazon and Walmart due to layout quirks during their checkout processes. It’s therefore crucial to scrutinize your checkout flow for even the smallest layout quirks – preferably across a wide range of browsers and devices, every single time there’s code changes to the checkout flow. Even sites with just moderate traffic levels will likely find such efforts worthwhile. While fixing layout quirks and technical bugs should be almost needless to say, our experience with benchmarking and auditing leading e-commerce sites for 7 years indicate otherwise – something we examine in-depth in: How Layout Bugs Keep Haunting E-Commerce Sites – It’s Time to Fix This. More Sites Are Visually Reinforcing Their Credit Card Fields Our 2012 checkout usability benchmark revealed that 89% of sites didn’t visually emphasize the security of their credit card fields, whereas our 2016 checkout usability benchmark shows that it’s now only 66% of the major US ecommerce sites that lack visual emphasis. (It’s worth noting that this significant improvement is despite these being major e-commerce brands which have the lowest need to increase their perceived security.) In essence our research findings may be boiled down to these two points: Users have little technical understanding of form field security and rather go by their perceived sense of security – something that is largely determined by the site’s brand recognizability and any visual cues surrounding the payment form. The user’s perceived level of security can be lifted through the use of visual clues like encapsulating the credit card fields with a solid background color, having site seals in close proximity to the card fields, using (effectively “meaningless”) padlock icons, and other visual reinforcements.

In other words, just because Comodo only scored 1.5% doesn’t mean their seal fails to inspire any confidence. Instead, what it means is that Norton’s seal inspires more confidence than Comodo’s. The seal options were randomized for each user. We always recommend that you A/B split-test different visually reinforced designs and different site seals to see what works the best for your unique audience and site context. The demographic for our tests were matched to the general US internet population. If reviewing other’s shared A/B-split test case studies on the performance of specific site seals, remember that the results are often highly specific to that site’s audience, and should be take with a grain of salt (like our’s, of course).

Chick-fil-A Fort Wright opens Oct. 6 Melissa Stewart, mstewart@communitypress.com 4:10 p.m. EDT October 5, 2016 Northern Kentucky’s newest Chick-fil-A Restaurant will create 80 new jobs. (Photo: Provided) FORT WRIGHT - Local owner and operator Brent Linn will open Northern Kentucky’s newest Chick-fil-A restaurant on Oct. 6 in Fort Wright. The new locations brings 80 new jobs. The grand opening festivities began when a family-friendly overnight First 100 celebration popped up in the restaurant’s parking lot at 3436 Madison Pike Route 17, just off I-275, in the Wal-Mart shopping center in Fort Wright. The first 100 adults through the door won a year of free Chick-fil-A meals. Reflecting his desire to have a positive impact on the surrounding community, Linn also invited his First 100 guests and restaurant customers to celebrate the new location by participating in a children’s book drive to benefit the Boys & Girls Club of Greater Cincinnati. Linn collected new and gently used children’s books at the restaurant on Oct. 3 -5. The donated books will be placed in a nearly 3-foot Book House to serve as a free library exchange. The Book House, built from reclaimed wood, is donated by the Chick-fil-A Foundation. Last year, Chick-fil-A collected more than 10,000 books from communities coast to coast, which were donated to 89 local organizations in 30 states and Washington, D.C. The new Fort Wright Chick-fil-A restaurant features a: heritage restaurant design that showcases handmade, authentic materials for a vintage-inspired interior, including a large gathering table made from reclaimed wood, subway tiles, and light fixtures made from recycled Coca-Cola bottles and peach baskets. • two-story interactive indoor play area for children and free Wi-Fi. • drive-thru service expanded to offer dual drive-thru ordering lanes and screens to enable customers to move quickly into a single lane for payment and pickup. • dining room with seating for 124 and with additional outdoor patio seating for 20. • full-service menu, including breakfast until 10:30 a.m., and will be open from 6:30 a.m. to 10 p.m., Monday through Saturday. Like all Chick-fil-A locations, it will be closed on Sunday.

USA TODAY Warren Buffett speaks on Oct. 13, 2015, in Washington, DC. (Photo: Paul Morigi, Getty Images for Fortune/Time) Warren Buffett is known for being a patient investor. But even his legendary patience must be getting tested by Wells Fargo (WFC). Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA) has suffered a $2.5 billion loss on its holdings in the bank since Sept. 8, when the Wells Fargo scandal intensified, according to a USA TODAY analysis of data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. That is when the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau accused Wells Fargo of creating upwards of 2 million phony customer accounts and hit the bank with a $185 million fine. Berkshire's loss for the year on Wells Fargo stock has hit $4.7 billion. That's a whopper even for a giant investment holding company that owns stakes in companies ranging from Coca-Cola (KO) to Visa (V) and Walmart (WMT). It's also more than twice the loss Berkshire has taken on its next 10 worst investments in public U.S. companies this year combined. In addition, that $4.7 loss nearly wipes out the $4.8 billion gain on its best-performing stock this year, Kraft Heinz (KHC), according to data from S&P Global. Berkshire Hathaway is the largest single holder of Wells Fargo stock, owning 10% of shares outstanding. Shares of Wells Fargo are down nearly 17% this year and off 10% since the settlement with the CFPB. Wells Fargo was Berkshire's biggest investment at the end of 2015, according to its annual report. Now, it's Berkshire's second-largest U.S. publicly traded holding after Kraft Heinz. Berkshire could not be reached for comment. USA TODAY $134.1M! Wells Fargo CEO's retirement payout even bigger than thought Despite being the largest shareholder in Wells Fargo, Buffett has been relatively quiet on the matter involving the sham accounts created so that thousands of employees could meet internal sales targets. During his testimony before the House Financial Services Committee last week, CEO John Stumpf said he'd only spoken to Buffett briefly about the widening scandal. The situation at Wells Fargo has gone from being a public relations debacle to an event that is actually hurting business. The treasurers of California and Illinois have both suspended doing business with Wells Fargo in several key areas, including those associated with it acting as a securities broker-dealer. On Wednesday, Chicago's city council voted to halt doing business with Wells Fargo for a year.

No one was reportedly hurt. A gunman opened fire inside a Wal-Mart store in southwest Washington on Wednesday morning. No one was reportedly hurt and the suspect is in custody.  (MIKE BLAKE / REUTERS)   By Associated Press Wed., Oct. 5, 2016 HAZEL DELL, WASH.—A Clark County sheriff’s spokesman says some employees hid and locked their doors, while others ran outside the store when a gunman opened fire inside a Wal-Mart store Wednesday morning in southwest Washington. Deputies searched the store for other possible accomplices but did not find any. Deputies responded to the store after getting a report of an active shooter just before 7 a.m. The store was open at the time of the shooting. Sgt. Fred Neiman says no one was hurt at the store just north of Vancouver, and the suspect is in custody. Neiman said workers “ did the right thing” by evacuating or taking refuge and calling police. He says the gunman fired rounds inside the store, but he did not immediately know what was struck or how many rounds were fired. He also did not know a possible motive, or how many people were in the store at the time of the shooting. Article Continued Below Gayle Yoshizawa, an associate who answered the phone at the store, told The Associated Press that no one was injured and that “everybody is fine and the situation is under control.” Read more about: Walmart The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.

But when Pulaski County Sheriff’s Office deputies assisted by the Virginia State Police were unable to find any explosive device, the store was reopened and is open for business as usual today. Law enforcement authorities conducted an extensive check of the inside of the store as well as the parking lot, but found nothing suspicious. The store’s security video was also checked to see if authorities could identify the person who wrote the message in the restroom. Written by: Editor on October 5, 2016.

TRICARE is adding all Walgreens pharmacies to the network, and removing all CVS pharmacies, including those in Target stores. Beneficiaries who continue to fill a prescription at CVS after the change will pay the full cost of their prescription upfront, and will then need to file a claim for partial reimbursement as from any other non-network pharmacy (Official Navy photo by Douglas H Stutz, NHB Public Affairs)  see less | View Image Page BREMERTON , WA, UNITED STATES 10.05.2016 Story by Douglas Stutz  Naval Hospital Bremerton ✔ ✗ Subscribe 1 Compiled by Naval Hospital Bremerton Public Affairs – Change is coming on Dec. 1, 2016, to the TRICARE Retail Pharmacy network and Naval Hospital Bremerton (NHB) can help if needed. The TRICARE pharmacy contractor, Express Scripts Inc. (ESI), will implement a change by adding all Walgreens pharmacies to the network, and removing all CVS pharmacies, including those in Target stores. Beneficiaries who continue to fill a prescription at CVS after the change will pay the full cost of their prescription upfront, and will then need to file a claim for partial reimbursement as from any other non-network pharmacy. There are several key points behind this decision. The network change will mean that there is now more than 57,000 retail pharmacies in the U.S., including other pharmacy chains, such as Rite Aid, Walmart and supermarkets that will remain in the TRICARE retail pharmacy network. The change will also expand access to 24-hour, drive through pharmacies, with an estimated 98 percent of beneficiaries having a network pharmacy within 5 miles of their homes. Additionally, NHB pharmacies – at the main facility, NHB Refill Annex, Branch Health Clinic (BHC) Bangor, BHC Everett, BHC Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, and the TRICARE Pharmacy Home Delivery program are lower-cost pharmacy options still available to beneficiaries. Lt. Cmdr. Eric Parsons, NHB Pharmacy department head, cites that Naval Hospital Bremerton Pharmacy and the TRICARE Pharmacy Home Delivery are both excellent, money-saving alternatives for beneficiaries. “We’ve been advocating the Home Delivery option for several years. It offers our TRICARE beneficiaries excellent care and service in addition to lower out-of-pocket costs when compared to obtaining chronic maintenance medications from the retail network,” said Parsons. Parsons attests that Naval Hospital Bremerton has an extensive formulary of medications available for beneficiaries, and Home Delivery provides an accommodating option for TRICARE beneficiaries to get their maintenance medications, especially for those who live farther away from a military pharmacy. “These choices are both less expensive than using the TRICARE retail network. Home Delivery can offer the convenience of having maintenance medications delivered directly to your home. A beneficiary will pay more to get their prescription filled at a non-network pharmacy, and they very well might need to pay up front and then file a claim for reimbursement,” said Parsons, adding that if someone decides to try the Naval Hospital Bremerton or BHC Everett pharmacy, they can call ahead for a new prescription at 360-475-4425 to make sure their medication is available. Home Delivery is the most convenient and cost saving way to refill a prescription. There are no shipping fees for up to a 90 day supply of medication to any address in the U.S. or overseas duty stations. For TRICARE Home Delivery, there are no out-of-pocket costs for up to a 90-day supply of generic medication, versus $8-$47 co-pay for up to a 30-day supply from a TRICARE retail pharmacy. Home Delivery can also provide automatic prescription refills so a beneficiary does not have to worry about last minute phone calls or dashes to the pharmacy. NHB offers several convenient ways to refill prescriptions: Online - Use our online prescription refill service by accessing TRICARE here. It is secure, fast, and no cost! By Phone - One call takes care of it! Just call (360) 475-4217 to refill your prescription. In Person - We have five locations where you may pick-up a refilled prescription: There are also easy steps to start refilling prescriptions at Naval Hospital Bremerton today. Beneficiaries do not have to enroll to use NHB pharmacies, but can either stop by or call NHB’s patient administration department (360) 475-4449 or (360) 475-4798 to register in order to start using NHB’s pharmacy. Each new prescription must be presented to the pharmacy for initial filling. Once it is filled the first time, a patient will receive a prescription number. Thereafter the prescription can be refilled online through the NHB webpage or via telephone. Pick up/delivery options vary. To switch to home delivery for pharmacy refills, beneficiaries can (also) visit: www.tricare.mil/homedelivery or call 1-877-782-8731. NHB’s formulary listing is also available online at http://www.med.navy.mil/sites/nhbrem/patients/Pages/pharmacy.aspx. Beneficiaries who continue to get select maintenance drugs at a network pharmacy will pay 100 percent of the cost. This does not apply to active duty service members. Patient costs vary based on where a beneficiary gets their prescription filled and the type of drug: generic, brand name or non-formulary. Beneficiaries can save on cost by asking their doctor to electronically-submit prescriptions for formulary medications to the NHB pharmacy for subsequent filling instead of to a network pharmacy. “We are available to assist,” Parsons stressed.

Gunman at Wal-Mart in Hazel Dell, Washington in custody, no one hurt Twitter Facebook Email Reddit HAZEL DELL, Wash. (AP) – Authorities say they quickly detained a gunman who reportedly opened fire inside a Wal-Mart store in southwest Washington. The Clark County Sheriff’s Office said in a news release that no one was injured in Wednesday morning’s incident just north of Vancouver. Deputies searched the store for other possible accomplices but did not find any. Deputies responded to the store after getting a report of an active shooter just before 7 a.m. The store was open at the time of the shooting. A Clark County sheriff’s spokesman says some employees hid and locked their doors, while others ran outside the store when the gunman opened fire. Sgt. Fred Neiman said workers “they did the right thing” by evacuating or taking refuge and calling police. He said the gunman fired rounds inside the store, but he did not immediately know what was struck or how many rounds were fired. He also did not know a possible motive, or how many people were in the store at the time of the shooting. Gayle Yoshizawa, an associate who answered the phone at the store, told The Associated Press that no one was injured and that “everybody is fine and the situation is under control.” She referred other questions to police.

A Week In The Newsroom Publications Newsroom Sign Up For Updates France throws plastic cutlery in the trash Home » Opinion » France throws plastic cutlery in the trash Posted By Esmeralda Perez on October 5, 2016 French officials announced that France will be the first country to ever ban plastic cutlery in the world. I don’t agree with this legislature because I view this action very difficult to succeed. People are too dependent on using it for parties, restaurants, cafeterias and has ultimately become integral to our way of life. This law will be enforced in year 2020 where plastic cutlery such as plates, carryout boxes, spoons, forks, and knives would be banned in the country. Moreover, it’s quite a shocker in today’s era considering the fact that many people, just like me, get lazy and would rather spend $5 on a 30 pack of utensils at Walmart and be set for the week. The major concept is to get people to adjust using another form of utensils that are non-plastic. President of France, François Hollande, created this law to incorporate with “Energy Transition for Green Growth Act”, an act made to effectively adjust climate change by reducing pollution, energy consumption etc. and introducing people an earth friendly environment. With this law being enforced in France, many other countries will become influenced by the idea. For example, some parts of California have slowly taken action in charging 10 cents for plastic bags instead of completely banning them; customers are reducing the intake of plastic bags and replacing them with reusable tote bags. This action could not possibly work in the United States because it will financially damage the production business of plastic cutlery as well as consumers who depend on plastic utensils. By using plastic cutlery, water is being conserved by not having to wash metal utensils. Plastic utensils are used on a daily basis for people who have a busy schedule and don’t have time to wash dishes. The majority of the time plastic cutlery users are on the go and don’t have access to water to clean metal cutlery such as workers outdoors and the homeless. Plastic cutlery is economically friendly, lightweight, and convenient for personal use as well as for businesses such as restaurants. Additionally, there are numerous fast food restaurants that need plastic utensils for the customers who take their food home. Resorting to metal utensils, by banning plastic cutlery, could result in higher operating costs for restaurant owners. Not only would businesses have to spend more money on metal utensils, but they would have increased labor and the wages that come with it due to the associated work and increased maintenance costs. Utensils made out of plastic are one time use and then get thrown away which makes it more sanitary. Meanwhile metal cutlery must be cleaned after every use or else customers become at risk of contracting diseases if they are not sanitized properly. Some of the food borne illness include salmonella, staphylococcus aureus, hepatitis A among others.   The journey of eliminating plastic cutlery is becoming a reality. In contrast, there are many obstacles that avoid the legislature from succeeding. Plastic cutlery is a dependency for humans and should not be banned.       Author: Esmeralda Perez Staff Writer Esmeralda Perez is a Journalism major and first semester with the Telescope.

A north Alabama man is accused of stealing about $10,000 from his 84-year-old neighbor by illegally obtaining the elderly man's personal information and opening two credit cards in his name. Brent Stovall, 54, is charged with 98 counts of fraudulent use of a credit card, two counts of third-degree possession of a forged instrument, and one count each of first-degree theft and first-degree financial exploitation of the elderly. Stovall is being held in the Lauderdale County Jail with bail set at $103,500. Authorities said Stovall was renting a house from the victim in the Rogersville community, and volunteered to bring the 84-year-old neighbor his mail. "Then the victim noticed he wasn't receiving his bank statements and contacted his bank," said Lauderdale County Chief Deputy Richard Richey. "He discovered several checks had been written and withdraws had been made without his knowledge. Then, he received statements from two credit card companies he hadn't applied with." The theft, which included fraudulent purchases at Wal-Mart stores in Florence and Muscle Shoals, reportedly occurred for about four months, beginning in April, Richey said. It was reported to the Sheriff's Office in August. "He was able to get all of the man's personal information from stealing the mail," Richey said. Cases of theft involving the elderly aren't uncommon because those adults often are the most vulnerable to exploitation, said Barry Spear, spokesman for the Department of Human Resources. DHR has an Adult Services Division that investigates crimes against the elderly alongside local law enforcement agencies as well as the Securities and Exchange Commission. "It's easier for somebody to take advantage of someone who isn't seen by the public a lot and spends a lot of time at home," Spear said. "We've had people who had their life savings taken from them. You have people saving and setting themselves up for their whole life financially, and then somebody comes in and takes it all from them. "We had one case in Elmore County where one lady was exploited to the point $1 million was taken, and it's something that can't be recovered." Richey said everyone, particularly the elderly, should always contact their bank or other financial institutions anytime they aren't getting mail they were expecting. "Or, if you can keep a check on those things online, that's good, too," he said. "You can also do a credit report check online to see if there are any accounts in your name you don't know about." If anyone suspects an elderly person is being exploited, it's important to report it to DHR's hotline at 1-800-458-7214 or by contacting the local office, Spear said. A report also can be filed via email. "A lot of times, you have adults being cared for by family members or friends and they're afraid to report it because they believe they won't have anyone to help them," Spear said. "We help in those situations by involving other nonprofit organizations or groups that can help with things like getting groceries or work around the house." Jail records list Stovall's permanent residence as Russellville in Franklin County.  If convicted, Stovall faces up to 20 years in prison on each of the two Class B felony charges: first-degree theft and exploitation. The other 100 charges are Class D felonies, punishable by one to five years on probation or community corrections. Most Read Get email notifications on your comments ...

USA TODAY Warren Buffett speaks on Oct. 13, 2015, in Washington, DC. (Photo: Paul Morigi, Getty Images for Fortune/Time) Warren Buffett is known for being a patient investor. But even his legendary patience must be getting tested by Wells Fargo (WFC). Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA) has suffered a $2.5 billion loss on its holdings in the bank since Sept. 8, when the Wells Fargo scandal intensified, according to a USA TODAY analysis of data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. That is when the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau accused Wells Fargo of creating upwards of 2 million phony customer accounts and hit the bank with a $185 million fine. Berkshire's loss for the year on Wells Fargo stock has hit $4.7 billion. That's a whopper even for a giant investment holding company that owns stakes in companies ranging from Coca-Cola (KO) to Visa (V) and Walmart (WMT). It's also more than twice the loss Berkshire has taken on its next 10 worst investments in public U.S. companies this year combined. In addition, that $4.7 loss nearly wipes out the $4.8 billion gain on its best-performing stock this year, Kraft Heinz (KHC), according to data from S&P Global. Berkshire Hathaway is the largest single holder of Wells Fargo stock, owning 10% of shares outstanding. Shares of Wells Fargo are down nearly 17% this year and off 10% since the settlement with the CFPB. Wells Fargo was Berkshire's biggest investment at the end of 2015, according to its annual report. Now, it's Berkshire's second-largest U.S. publicly traded holding after Kraft Heinz. Berkshire could not be reached for comment. USA TODAY $134.1M! Wells Fargo CEO's retirement payout even bigger than thought Despite being the largest shareholder in Wells Fargo, Buffett has been relatively quiet on the matter involving the sham accounts created so that thousands of employees could meet internal sales targets. During his testimony before the House Financial Services Committee last week, CEO John Stumpf said he'd only spoken to Buffett briefly about the widening scandal. The situation at Wells Fargo has gone from being a public relations debacle to an event that is actually hurting business. The treasurers of California and Illinois have both suspended doing business with Wells Fargo in several key areas, including those associated with it acting as a securities broker-dealer. On Wednesday, Chicago's city council voted to halt doing business with Wells Fargo for a year.

This year, 45% of employers are giving employees access to centers of excellence, or COEs, organizations that have high quality ratings in specialties such as cardiac or orthopedic services and infertility, according to the survey data released Tuesday by risk management and employee benefit consulting firm Willis Towers Watson. That's up from just 37% of employers in 2015 who provided access to COEs, the survey of 600 U.S. employers with more than 1,000 employees each showed. Collectively, the companies employ 12.2 million full-time workers in various industries. Companies like General Electric Co., Wal-Mart Stores and Lowe's Cos. have partnered with hospitals to design COE programs as a way to control rising health benefit costs, which are expected to increase overall 6% in 2017, according to the National Business Group on Health. An additional 32% of employers surveyed by Willis Towers Watson said they plan to provide access to COEs by 2018. Still, few employers give employees incentives to use the COE, with only 17% reducing employee cost-sharing for getting medical care at the center. Fifty-four percent of employers said they may start reducing cost-sharing by 2018, however. Narrow networks designed to include high-quality doctors with lower costs for services are also gaining traction. Proponents say these “high-performance networks” differ from HMO networks of old, which were typically narrowed by cutting out the most expensive doctors instead of paying attention to quality ratings. According to the survey, 20% of employers offer high-performance networks today, up from 11% in 2015, and 39% of those surveyed said they may add high-performance networks in the next three years. Of those employers that have implemented high-performance networks, about 50% reduce employee cost sharing for in-network care. The survey also found that 16% of employers are considering contracting directly with medical service providers, such as COEs, accountable care organizations and patient-centered medical homes, for reduced prices on services. Only 8% do so today, the survey found. According to a survey released in August by the National Business Group on Health, 4% or fewer of very large employers surveyed contracted directly with COEs for various types of medical services. Most accessed the COE through the health plan rather than contracting directly, Washington-based NBGH said. While employers are growing more interested in working with providers to move to value-based care, “the strategies are more common in geographies where employers have large concentrations of employees or where cost-efficient providers are available and willing to engage in emerging reimbursement models,” Trevis Parson, chief actuary of health and benefits at Willis Towers Watson, said in a statement. Insurance features that direct employees to high-value providers will also grow in the next few years. Though 11% of employers said they reduce point-of-care costs for high-value services, 47% may do so by 2018, according to the survey. Nine percent of employers increase such costs for commonly overused services, but 41% may do so by 2018. Finally, 31% of employers say they may require employees to pay a higher cost for certain medical procedures if they don't first get a second opinion, though only 4% do so this year.

LATEST VIDEOS More Videos: Rates from Bankrate.com Mortgage Credit Cards Auto Tractor Supply, Citadel open; Dairy Queen, Mattress Warehouse, state store coming to Harleysville shopping center 10/31/2016 - 11:14 AM EDT LOWER SALFORD >> Two businesses are open and two more buildings are in the process of being built in the new shopping area at the intersection of routes 113 and 63. A ribbon-cutting and Indian Valley Chamber of Commerce business card exchange were held Sept. 28 at the new Citadel Federal Credit Union that had opened about a month earlier. In July, Tractor Supply was the first to open in the strip along Harleysville Pike (Route 113) that neighbors another shopping center, which includes Walmart and a Giant supermarket. The Harleysville Citadel employs six and is Citadel's 21st branch, said Chuck Hayes, market manager of the branch and a Harleysville resident.

Citadel is a federal credit union, which is different than a bank, he said. "A credit union is member owned," he said. "Rather than having shareholders, we have members," said Hayes, who worked in traditional banking for 18 years before joining Citadel. "All of our board of directors are volunteer." At a credit union, the profits go back to the members, he said. Chris Samsel, owner of the Harleysville Dairy Queen, who was giving out samples at the ribbon-cutting and card exchange, said the current Harleysville Dairy Queen is closing and moving to the center with Tractor Supply and Citadel. "Early part of February 2017, we're due to open," he said. "We'll have a drive-thru here, which is a big addition for us," Samsel said. Along with adding the drive-thru, the new location will have better access and more visibility than the current location, he said. "Right now, we have about 10 employees. We'll probably double that at the new location," Samsel said. "With the drive-thru, we'll need more people working," Samsel said. "It'll be a busier store." Samsel, a Harleysville resident, said he's been involved in Dairy Queen for about 20 years and previously was a Hatfield Township police officer. The Harleysville Dairy Queen has been at its current location since 2008, he said. Mattress Warehouse will be opening a store in the other part of the building in which the new Dairy Queen will be located, he said. A Wine & Spirits state store will also be moving into the center, Hayes said. Greg Jones, vice president of brokerage services at Metro Commercial, said there is also additional space available to be leased at the site. There are ongoing negotiations with additional possible tenants, but those discussions have not yet been finalized, he said. The Tractor Supply store is that company's 86th store in Pennsylvania and employs 15, according to a company release before the store's July grand opening. 1 2 next  last »

MUST CREDIT: Bloomberg photo by Michael Short. Bloomberg Google unveiled new hardware from smartphones and smart speakers to wireless routers on Tuesday. It was a year-long odyssey that involved design, supply chain negotiations and the search for a manufacturing partner. Now the Alphabet Inc. unit must grapple with the equally daunting challenge of getting the gadgets to consumers. It has a history of retail strategies that either struggled or never got off the ground, according to people familiar with the company's retail efforts. What's more, it's inexperienced dealing with returns and recycling. And unlike rival Apple Inc., the company lacks its own stores where it can showcase hardware as it pleases and instead relies on other companies' in-store displays. This time, the stakes are higher because the latest gadgets are vehicles for Google's digital assistant, a key product that is chasing Amazon.com Inc.'s Alexa and Apple's Siri. "We view go-to-market as a clear hurdle to wide acceptance, which will require investments in brand, marketing and distribution to overcome," UBS analyst Eric Sheridan wrote in a note to investors. Google is selling the new Pixel phones at Verizon Communications and Best Buy stores in the U.S., via its own online store, a temporary physical store in New York City and through its wireless service Project Fi. It's working with a small number of other wireless carriers and retailers in countries including Germany and India. Google Home, the new speaker, is available at Best Buy, Wal-Mart Stores and Target stores, in addition to Google's online store. Cutting distribution deals with a handful of carriers and retailers isn't enough, according to Forrester Research analyst Thomas Husson. "Google will have to up its customer-service game and do many more distribution partnerships," he said. Many of Google's past efforts at selling hardware have fizzled. When the company started its Nexus brand in 2010 it planned to market the phones online only, but sales never took off. About 200,000 of the first Nexus model sold, short of Google's target of several million units, according to a person who worked on the device. Then there was Android Silver. Kicked off some time in 2014, the internal project was designed to sell high-end Android handsets with partners to compete with Apple. Google set up a retail lab for the effort, claiming an entire building near its Mountain View, California headquarters, according to former employees. But it never got off the ground. Nikesh Arora, Google's sales chief at the time, drove the initiative. When he left in July 2014, Android Silver was shelved. One former Google executive called it a boondoggle. The former Googlers didn't want to be identified discussing private information. A Google spokeswoman declined to comment. Such experiments are a contrast to Apple stores that are the envy of the retail industry. Apple considers the iPhone in terms of the product's complete life cycle, from leaving the factory to when customers stop using the device. Apple offers a recycling program through physical and online stores. Google's new smartphone unit approached potential wireless carrier partners early this year, according to a person familiar with the situation. Some carriers peppered Google executives with questions about handling phone returns and technical support, the person said. At the time, Google did not appear ready to take on these aspects of the phone hardware business, according to this person. Google executives on the hardware team say the company is on a "journey," gaining experience and capabilities with each smartphone generation. And Apple only began touting the iPhone's full life cycle after a few generations. On Tuesday, as a Google event began in San Francisco, new hardware chief Rick Osterloh reassured the audience that the company was serious about the move. "We're in it for the long run," he said. About nine months after initial talks with carriers, Google rolled out its flavor of technical support: Pixels have built-in chat support where customer-service reps can take over smartphone screens to identify problems. Google will be responsible for returns and recycling and is building a supply chain that can re-absorb faulty and rejected devices, Osterloh said in a recent interview. Osterloh will be partly judged by how many devices Google sells, a contrast to the Nexus program which showcased Android features for other handset makers to adopt. But the executive was still cagey about the company's sales aspirations. "In markets where we do business, we're definitely going to want meaningful share," he said. "But it's highly unlikely that the primary driver will be to be in every market with as high as possible volume." Google still sees software as its edge, rather than retail distribution and customer service. The company spent more time on Tuesday talking about the digital assistant baked into its new gadgets, and how they work together. If Google can get millions of people relying on its assistant, the company may be able to compete with Apple's devices, according to Brian Blau, an analyst at Gartner. "The AI assistant will give them something that Apple has enjoyed for many years: Lock-in to the system," he said. <저작권자 © 울산매일, 무단 전재 및 재배포 금지>  저작권 문의 블룸버그 다른기사 보기 이메일 기사 수정 :   2016-10-06 01:10   김동균 기자 웹출판 :   2016-10-06 01:10   관리자 입력.편집 :   2016-10-06 01:09   김동균 기자 icon오늘의 인기기사 SKT, '루나S' 태권브이 에디션 한정판 1천대 판매 세종∼평택 국도 개통 세종시 중심에 조성되는 국립중앙수목원 이미지 농민들 '트랙터 몰고 청와대로' 제네시스 EQ900 '북미 올해의 차' 최종 후보 SKT, '루나S' 태권브이 에디션 한정판 1천대 판매 댓글 (200자평) 0개 전체보기 200자까지 쓰실 수 있습니다. 등록 ※ 비속어와 인신공격성 글 등은 바로 삭제됩니다. 특히, 근거 없는 글로 타인의 명예를 훼손하면 민·형사상 처벌을 받을 수 있습니다.

(AP) — A gunman who opened fire inside a Wal-Mart store in southwest Washington was quickly taken into custody Wednesday before anyone was injured, authorities said. The Clark County Sheriff's Office identified the gunman as Shaun Michael Sprague, 35, of Gillette, Wyoming and said he was booked into Clark County Jail on suspicion of first-degree assault. It wasn't clear when he would have a first court appearance or if he had retained an attorney. Deputies searched the store just north of Vancouver for other possible accomplices but did not find any. Deputies responded to the store after getting a report of an active shooter just before 7 a.m. The store was open at the time of the shooting. Gayle Yoshizawa, an associate who answered the phone at the store, told The Associated Press that no one was injured and that "everybody is fine and the situation is under control." She referred other questions to police.

Mall of America, the nation's largest shopping mall, says that it will be closed on Thanksgiving in 2016. The center has been open on the holiday since 2012 and could inspire other shopping malls or stores to follow suit. The mall will re-open at 5 a.m. on the Friday after Thanksgiving. (Photo: AP) NEW YORK — Mall of America, the nation’s largest shopping mall anchored by Macy’s, H&M and others, has taken a stand against the growing trend of Thanksgiving shopping and will be closed on the turkey feast this year. The center, based in Bloomington, Minn., has been open on Thanksgiving since 2012. But mall officials said the mall wants to offer workers time with their families. The mall will re-open at 5 a.m. on the Friday after Thanksgiving. “We think Thanksgiving is a day for families and for people we care about,” Jill Renslow, the mall’s senior vice president of marketing, exclusively told The Associated Press. “We want to give this day back.” The Friday after Thanksgiving had long served as the official kickoff to the holiday shopping season. But over the past several years, Thanksgiving has become the new tradition as malls and stores try to outdo others to get their first dibs on the shopper at a time of increasing competition from online retailers. Many major stores like Macy’s, Target and J.C. Penney have opened increasingly earlier on Thanksgiving. But the move has also been controversial as many workers have voiced complaints and signed petitions that stores are putting profits over workers’ time to be with their families. ► Related: How early is too early? Walmart starts holiday season Office supplies retailer Staples Inc., announced last month that it will close on Thanksgiving for the second year in a row, though it will offer deals on its website. High-end stores like Neiman Marcus, Nordstrom and Saks Fifth Avenue have remained closed on that day. Given its size and status, the Mall of America could inspire other malls and stores to follow suit. Many of the major retailers and malls have not made their plans for the Thanksgiving weekend season public. At Mall of America, the mall opened for the first time on Thanksgiving at midnight in 2012 and then in 2013 opened at 8 p.m. For Thanksgiving in 2014 and 2015, the mall was open at 6 p.m. Mall of America’s move could impact 14,000 employees who work at the mall or at one of its tenants. The number includes 1,200 mall employees. Still, Mall of America said some of its tenants may choose to be open on Thanksgiving. So it will have security and other key personnel on duty to ensure smooth operations. For the first time ever, Mall of America will close its movie theater and its Nickelodeon Universe amusement park on Thanksgiving. It owns both attractions. It will continue to host its Walk to End Hunger on Thanksgiving morning, a community event that the mall has hosted for eight years that helps provide meals for families in need. Renslow noted that as Mall of America began opening earlier and earlier into Thanksgiving day, it had gotten some split feedback from workers. Asked whether Mall of America would revert to opening on Thanksgiving next year if sales suffer that weekend, Renslow said she’s confident that business will be consistent. Overall, she believes Mall of America will continue to attract 400,000 visitors for the long holiday weekend. 18 CONNECTTWEET 1 LINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://on.freep.com/2dJWk0O More Stories Romney McDaniel gains support for Michigan GOP reelection Nov. 18, 2016, 10:18 a.m. Man dead, wife chased out window in marijuana robbery Nov. 18, 2016, 10:03 a.m. EPA: Flint must test new water source for 3 months Nov. 18, 2016, 10 a.m. Johnny and June Carter Cash's former lakefront Tenn. estate for sale Nov. 18, 2016, 1:21 a.m.

Now it must fix its retail strategy Unlike Apple, company lacks its own retail stores Video Photo Google Pixel phones and the Google Daydream View VR viewer are displayed during the presentation of new Google hardware in San Francisco, California, U.S. October 4, 2016. (REUTERS/Beck Diefenbach) The sculpture of a Google Inc.’s Android mobile operating system mascot sits inside the Googleplex headquarters in Mountain View, California, on Feb. 18, 2016. (Bloomberg photo by Michael Short) By Mark Bergen and Mark Gurman, Bloomberg Oct 5, 2016 at 9:55 am | Print View Google unveiled new hardware from smartphones and smart speakers to wireless routers on Tuesday. It was a yearlong odyssey that involved design, supply chain negotiations and the search for a manufacturing partner. Now the Alphabet Inc. unit must grapple with the equally daunting challenge of getting the gadgets to consumers. It has a history of retail strategies that either struggled or never got off the ground, according to people familiar with the company’s retail efforts. What’s more, it’s inexperienced dealing with returns and recycling. And unlike rival Apple Inc., the company lacks its own stores where it can showcase hardware as it pleases and instead relies on other companies’ in-store displays. This time, the stakes are higher because the latest gadgets are vehicles for Google’s digital assistant, a key product that is chasing Amazon.com Inc.’s Alexa and Apple’s Siri. “We view go-to-market as a clear hurdle to wide acceptance, which will require investments in brand, marketing and distribution to overcome,” UBS analyst Eric Sheridan wrote in a note to investors. Google is selling the new Pixel phones at Verizon Communications and Best Buy stores in the U.S., via its own online store, a temporary physical store in New York City and through its wireless service Project Fi. It’s working with a small number of other wireless carriers and retailers in countries including Germany and India. Google Home, the new speaker, is available at Best Buy, Wal-Mart Stores and Target stores, in addition to Google’s online store. Cutting distribution deals with a handful of carriers and retailers isn’t enough, according to Forrester Research analyst Thomas Husson. “Google will have to up its customer-service game and do many more distribution partnerships,” he said. Many of Google’s past efforts at selling hardware have fizzled. When the company started its Nexus brand in 2010 it planned to market the phones online only, but sales never took off. About 200,000 of the first Nexus model sold, short of Google’s target of several million units, according to a person who worked on the device. Then there was Android Silver. Kicked off some time in 2014, the internal project was designed to sell high-end Android handsets with partners to compete with Apple. Google set up a retail lab for the effort, claiming an entire building near its Mountain View, California headquarters, according to former employees. But it never got off the ground. Nikesh Arora, Google’s sales chief at the time, drove the initiative. When he left in July 2014, Android Silver was shelved. One former Google executive called it a boondoggle. The former Googlers didn’t want to be identified discussing private information. A Google spokeswoman declined to comment. Such experiments are a contrast to Apple stores that are the envy of the retail industry. Apple considers the iPhone in terms of the product’s complete life cycle, from leaving the factory to when customers stop using the device. Apple offers a recycling program through physical and online stores. Google’s new smartphone unit approached potential wireless carrier partners early this year, according to a person familiar with the situation. Some carriers peppered Google executives with questions about handling phone returns and technical support, the person said. At the time, Google did not appear ready to take on these aspects of the phone hardware business, according to this person. Google executives on the hardware team say the company is on a “journey,” gaining experience and capabilities with each smartphone generation. And Apple only began touting the iPhone’s full life cycle after a few generations. On Tuesday, as a Google event began in San Francisco, new hardware chief Rick Osterloh reassured the audience that the company was serious about the move. “We’re in it for the long run,” he said. About nine months after initial talks with carriers, Google rolled out its flavor of technical support: Pixels have built-in chat support where customer-service reps can take over smartphone screens to identify problems. Google will be responsible for returns and recycling and is building a supply chain that can reabsorb faulty and rejected devices, Osterloh said in a recent interview. Osterloh will be partly judged by how many devices Google sells, a contrast to the Nexus program which showcased Android features for other handset makers to adopt. But the executive was still cagey about the company’s sales aspirations. “In markets where we do business, we’re definitely going to want meaningful share,” he said. “But it’s highly unlikely that the primary driver will be to be in every market with as high as possible volume.” Google still sees software as its edge, rather than retail distribution and customer service. The company spent more time on Tuesday talking about the digital assistant baked into its new gadgets, and how they work together. If Google can get millions of people relying on its assistant, the company may be able to compete with Apple’s devices, according to Brian Blau, an analyst at Gartner. “The AI assistant will give them something that Apple has enjoyed for many years: Lock-in to the system,” he said.

Some companies have cited economic growth and market type as reasons for their interest. Many are searching for local franchisees. Philly Pretzel Factory One such company is Philly Pretzel Factory, which Chief Development Officer Tom Monaghan said wants to expand to Louisiana, starting with Lake Charles. He said key location requirements include a large population size, a value-based market, good real estate opportunities and a high percentage of children, all of which Lake Charles has. “You really checked off all the boxes,” Monaghan said. He said the final hurdle is finding the right franchisee to run the location. Since the company relies heavily on catering for large employers, such as district schools, a franchisee must enjoy connecting with businesses and participating in events, Monaghan said. He described franchisees as “pretzel mayors of their towns.” He said he expects to find a franchisee soon and open a store in Lake Charles by late spring. He said Philly Pretzel Factory may locate in a strip center or large venue, such as Wal-Mart. Ruby Tuesday Another food franchise looking for a local operator is Ruby Tuesday. James Vitrano, vice president of franchise development and operations, said the company wants to return to Lake Charles after closing its location across from Prien Lake Mall following the 2008 recession. He said Lake Charles has “that vibe we’re looking for,” and caught Ruby Tuesday’s attention as a “midsize market with growth potential.” Vitrano said Ruby Tuesday is looking for a consumer base that appreciates good food at a low price. He said the revitalization of the national economy and the company’s new brand have enabled Ruby Tuesday to start expanding franchise operations this year. He said franchising is important to the company because it ensures local involvement. “Franchising is something that I believe in, because who’s going to know Lake Charles better than someone who lives in Lake Charles and owns a home here,” Vitrano said. Jan-Pro Cleaning Franchises from the services sector have also expressed interest in the area. Jan-Pro, a commercial cleaning company, is looking for a regional master franchisee in the Lake Charles area to oversee individual home-based franchisees, said Scott Thompson, vice president of franchise development. After “such amazing success” in the New Orleans and Baton Rouge areas — where the regional master franchisee was a “rising star last year at the national conference” — the company wants to develop a base in another Louisiana market, Thompson said. He said Lake Charles appeals to the company because of the area’s steady growth. Franchisees will serve medical facilities, businesses, schools and industries, among others. He said the regional master franchisee should have a sales mindset and an interest in building a family legacy. Two Men and a Truck Another service franchise that wants to locate in Lake Charles is moving company Two Men and a Truck. Noelle Burak, franchise development manager, said growth in the area indicates that “people and business have to be moved.” Burak said Lake Charles’ location on Interstate 10 is an attractive quality for a trucking company. It provides a chance to do long-distance moves as well as local ones, she said. One reason Two Men and Truck chose franchising as a business model is that it “lends more credibility to the moving industry” — which has somewhat of a bad reputation, she said. She said franchisees are locally accountable and held to high standards. She said the company is “always looking for a franchisee,” and that it has the resources to train an aspiring franchise operator, without the risk that comes with starting a business from scratch.

After reviewing his work following one year on the job, the council gave Moody a raise to more than $100,000 a year. The five-hour special meeting consisted of a series of executive sessions and ended with a unanimous public vote to approve a new contract to supersede Moody’s original contract. That original contract paid Moody $96,000 a year. He’ll now earn $102,000 annually. Both the original contract and the new one are “evergreen” and have no ending dates, officials said. The new contract also calls for increased severance pay for Moody, should the council fire him “without cause.” Moody came to Roeland Park after serving as city administrator in Platte City and then in Harrisonville, Mo. “He’s done a great job for us,” Mayor Joel Marquardt said. “We’re pleased with the vast amount of municipal leadership experience he possesses.” The extension capped a day of good news for Roeland Park. Significantly, the long-simmering threat of losing the city’s largest single sales tax generator, the Wal-Mart store at 5150 Roe Blvd., seemed to evaporate with the announcement that the retailer was dropping plans to move to Mission, and into developer Tom Valenti’s Mission Gateway proposed project at Roe and Johnson Drive. Wal-Mart also pledged to remodel the Roeland Park store. City administrators have also been focusing on issues with the Roeland Park Aquatic Center. At last week’s regular meeting, council members approved an agreement to evenly split with the Johnson County Park and Recreation District the cost of a new, $128,000 blower and heater for the fabric dome that covers the aquatic facility each winter. Moody said the eight weeks needed to order and install the device means the pool at 4843 Rosewood Drive will remain uncovered through November. The city will continue to heat the water so that the swim teams, including the Kansas City Blazers and Bishop Miege High School, that use the pool may continue to do so. Moody said Johnson County Park and Recreation has told the city that it does not wish to extend the agreement to split the operating costs of the pool when the deal expires at the end of 2018. That means Roeland Park would need to cover the entire annual cost of about $400,000. Meanwhile, city staffers will undertake a detailed study to determine how much it would cost to operate the pool on a summer-only basis, versus year-round. The pool opened 20 years ago and has been managed ever since by the county. The county initially paid for the winter dome and supporting equipment. The dome was patched a couple of years ago and should last for another eight years, Moody said, while a new dome would cost $300,000.

Kohl’s rolls out its own mobile payments platform, Kohl’s Pay Posted Oct 5, 2016 by Sarah Perez (@sarahintampa) 0 SHARES Next Story Volvo cars will start talking to each other by the end of 2016 Larger retailers are beginning to offer their own alternatives to emerging mobile payment systems, like Apple Pay, Android Pay and Samsung Pay. Today the latest to launch its own, independent mobile payment platform is department store chain Kohl’s, which has now integrated “Kohl’s Pay,” along with its loyalty and rewards programs, into the company’s mobile app. As of this morning, Kohl’s Pay is available nationwide, the company says. The retailer had previously announced the arrival of Kohl’s Pay as an expansion to its existing mobile wallet capabilities, which had allowed consumers to save their payment information and collect promotions and rewards. Kohl’s mobile payments launch follows other recent moves from Walmart and CVS, which also now have their own mobile payment solutions bundled in their smartphone applications. However, Kohl’s initiative is different in that it doesn’t allow consumers to add their own payment cards — instead, the solution is entirely focused on Kohl’s Charge, its private label card. That will make it less appealing for shoppers who are simply looking for an easier and quicker way to check out at the register, while also tapping into offers and rewards, like Kohl’s Cash and Yes2You Rewards. kohls_pay-lp-frame-20161010-simplicity_screen_2x-image kohls_pay-lp-frame-20161010-savings_screen_2x-image kohls_pay-lp-frame-20161010-transaction_screen_2x-image  View Slideshow Previous Next Exit That being said, the retailer has more than 25 million active cardholders across the U.S., so there is a sizable market that may be interested in using Kohl’s Pay at the point-of-sale. And these are Kohl’s most active and loyal customers — 60 percent of its in-store sales are done through its store cards, the retailer has said. What makes the solution better than traditional methods (e.g. cash, credit cards) is that it allows shoppers to automatically redeem the rewards they’ve collected in the app’s mobile wallet, at the same time as they check out — that is, it all takes place within one transaction. Plus, because transaction histories are stored in the app, returns and exchanges become easier, as consumers won’t have to dig up their paper receipts. One area where Kohl’s did mimic other retailers is in how the mobile payment service works. Unlike with Apple Pay or Android Pay, Kohl’s Pay does not support NFC (tap to pay) transactions. Instead, consumers launch the app, choose Kohl’s Pay from the menu, then scan the QR code that appears on the customer display at point-of-sale. This code is scanned once to both pay for the transaction and apply the savings. Then you tap to approve and complete the transaction. The app, which has been downloaded 14 million times, also lets shoppers save Kohl’s gift cards in their mobile wallet, browse products, scan items in store, receive sale alerts, check out in the store then get the item shipped for free and more. What’s interesting about the launch of Kohl’s Pay is that Kohl’s was also an earlier adopter of Apple Pay, having been the first retailer to add its private label card and rewards program to Apple’s payment service. But with Apple Pay and other solutions, retailers don’t have such easy access to shopping data as when they use their own platform. With Kohl’s Pay, the company will be able to gain more insight about its sales and promotions, among other things. Kohl’s Pay is available in the retailer’s mobile app, found here. The app is available on both iOS and Android. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Kohl’s Founded 1988 Overview Kohl’s Corporation (Kohl’s) operate family-oriented department stores that sell apparel, footwear and accessories for women, men and children; soft home products, such as sheets and pillows, and housewares.

It was a year-long odyssey that involved design, supply chain negotiations and the search for a manufacturing partner. Now the Alphabet Inc unit must grapple with the equally daunting challenge of getting the gadgets to consumers. It has a history of retail strategies that either struggled or never got off the ground, according to people familiar with the company’s retail efforts. What’s more, it’s inexperienced dealing with returns and recycling. And unlike rival Apple Inc, the company lacks its own stores where it can showcase hardware as it pleases and instead relies on other companies’ in-store displays. This time, the stakes are higher because the latest gadgets are vehicles for Google’s digital assistant, a key product that is chasing Amazon.com Inc’s Alexa and Apple’s Siri. “We view go-to-market as a clear hurdle to wide acceptance, which will require investments in brand, marketing and distribution to overcome,” UBS analyst Eric Sheridan wrote in a note to investors. Google is selling the new Pixel phones at Verizon Communications Inc and Best Buy Co stores in the US, via its own online store, a temporary physical store in New York City and through its wireless service Project Fi. It’s working with a small number of other wireless carriers and retailers in countries including Germany and India. Google Home, the new speaker, is available at Best Buy, Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Target Corp stores, in addition to Google’s online store. Cutting distribution deals with a handful of carriers and retailers isn’t enough, according to Forrester Research analyst Thomas Husson. “Google will have to up its customer-service game and do many more distribution partnerships,” he said. Many of Google’s past efforts at selling hardware have fizzled. When the company started its Nexus brand in 2010 it planned to market the phones online only, but sales never took off. About 200,000 of the first Nexus model sold, short of Google’s target of several million units, according to a person who worked on the device. Then there was Android Silver. Kicked off some time in 2014, the internal project was designed to sell high-end Android handsets with partners to compete with Apple. Google set up a retail lab for the effort, claiming an entire building near its Mountain View, California headquarters, according to former employees. But it never got off the ground. Nikesh Arora, Google’s sales chief at the time, drove the initiative. When he left in July 2014, Android Silver was shelved. One former Google executive called it a boondoggle. The former Googlers didn’t want to be identified discussing private information. A Google spokeswoman declined to comment. Apple envy Such experiments are a contrast to Apple stores that are the envy of the retail industry. Apple considers the iPhone in terms of the product’s complete life cycle, from leaving the factory to when customers stop using the device. Apple offers a recycling programme through physical and online stores. Google’s new smartphone unit approached potential wireless carrier partners early this year, according to a person familiar with the situation. Some carriers peppered Google executives with questions about handling phone returns and technical support, the person said. At the time, Google did not appear ready to take on these aspects of the phone hardware business, according to this person. Google executives on the hardware team say the company is on a “journey,” gaining experience and capabilities with each smartphone generation. And Apple only began touting the iPhone’s full life cycle after a few generations. Responsible returns Yesterday, as a Google event began in San Francisco, new hardware chief Rick Osterloh reassured the audience that the company was serious about the move. “We’re in it for the long run,” he said. About nine months after initial talks with carriers, Google rolled out its flavour of technical support: Pixels have built-in chat support where customer-service reps can take over smartphone screens to identify problems. Google will be responsible for returns and recycling and is building a supply chain that can re-absorb faulty and rejected devices, Osterloh said in a recent interview. Osterloh will be partly judged by how many devices Google sells, a contrast to the Nexus programme which showcased Android features for other handset makers to adopt. But the executive was still cagey about the company’s sales aspirations. “In markets where we do business, we’re definitely going to want meaningful share,” he said. “But it’s highly unlikely that the primary driver will be to be in every market with as high as possible volume.” Google still sees software as its edge, rather than retail distribution and customer service. The company spent more time yesterday talking about the digital assistant baked into its new gadgets, and how they work together. If Google can get millions of people relying on its assistant, the company may be able to compete with Apple’s devices, according to Brian Blau, an analyst at Gartner. “The AI assistant will give them something that Apple has enjoyed for many years: Lock-in to the system,” he said. — Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Facebook fake news writer on how he possibly influenced the US election Pushing the limits of science at the first Cyborg Olympics (VIDEO) Udacity, an online learning startup, offers tech job trials How Twitter, Instagram and Facebook are stepping up measures to fight online abuse (VIDEO) Soar above the planet’s most spectacular sights with Google Earth VR (VIDEO) Sony’s PS3 celebrates 10-year anniversary WhatsApp joins rivals from Snapchat to WeChat in video calls Facebook accidentally declares some users dead, including founder Zuckerberg Tinder launches transgender-inclusive update, allowing users to select personalised gender identity (VIDEO) Best smartphones for holiday 2016 Most Watched Now Week Neil Patrick Harris stars as Count Olaf in trailer for ‘A Series of Unfortunate Events’ Jessica Chastain in ‘The Zookeeper’s Wife’ Movie accent expert breaks down 32 actors’ accents Ah Beng reviews iguana’s epic escape from snakes (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Did you know: The ocean is way deeper than you think Reuters Video: Thailand sinks boats to tackle illegal fishing Related Articles Google, an Obama ally, may face policy setbacks under Trump Google to name and shame the web’s worst malware offenders Daydream View brings Google’s VR experience to five countries Google hawks hardware in real-world ‘showroom’ Google rolls out Chrome Canary experimental web browser to Android Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2016 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

(OTCQX: YGYI) (www.YGYI.com), a global direct marketer of nutritional and lifestyle products, and also a vertically integrated producer of gourmet coffees for the commercial, retail, and direct sales channels recently announced at the company's See the Change Convention in Salt Lake City, UT the launching of Cart Ripple, an online and mobile shopping app as part of their ecommerce shopping program. Cart Ripple features more than 2000 retailers in over 20 categories including electronics, apparel and footwear, food and wine, books, gifts, pet care, travel and more. A small sampling of stores that are on the Cart Ripple platform include Walmart, Kohls, Target, Starbucks, Macys, Best Buy, Foot Locker, Sephora and Nordstrom's. The participating retailers offer special sales promotions, discounts and cash back to the Cart Ripple consumer. An additional feature is a price comparison tool that allows a shopper to scan or enter an item to compare the best prices available at Cart Ripple's ecommerce stores. At the See the Change convention Youngevity distributors were first able to become registered users of Cart Ripple's app. Cart Ripple allows the distributors to personally benefit with savings, special deals, and cash back as they shop, and in addition, to refer other consumers to the app and website and participate in the cash back created from the purchases of others. This is continually extended as each consumer "tells a friend," referring a new generation of friends and family shoppers from which the original distributor receives benefits. Steve Wallach, CEO of Youngevity stated, "The combination of Cart Ripple and Youngevity was so intriguing and such a natural fit for our organization and distributors that as I tried to find reasons not to bring the two together, I continued to feel more and more compelled that it was right to put Cart Ripple in the hands of our people, as shoppers and as virtual sales people. We believed that many were already shopping at these stores, as were their friends, so why not make shopping a more economically rewarding experience." Dave Briskie, President and CFO of Youngevity stated, "We feel the marriage of direct selling with thousands of established retailers is such an exciting opportunity to all involved. Cart Ripple gives our distributors, their customers, and their customer's friends a robust shopping experience, along with financial incentives and benefits that fit Youngevity's model so well. Our thoughts were 'why not save money or get paid for shopping at the retailers you're already spending at.' Once we were able to create a structure that we felt could work for everyone participating in the Youngevity-Cart Ripple combination we believed our distributors would embrace this opportunity immediately, and the rippling would begin." David Rutz, VP of Global Services at Youngevity said, "The Cart Ripple app and website were designed with one purpose, saving consumers money and doing so conveniently! We are all finding ways to do things more efficiently with smart phones, and Cart Ripple is designed to meet consumers right where they are. The price compare option provides fast price comparison for savings to users, with special deals, discounts and cash back bonuses to amp those savings up. We believe it is all about the simplicity and the savings, and when you couple the friends and family aspect which gives users cash back on the shopping of those they refer, you've got the recipe for a ripple effect!"

The Kansas City Star reports that the boy facing felony sexual assault charges stemming from incidents that took place last month was investigated by police in 2015 for exposing himself to a female classmate at Indian Hills Middle School. The parents of the girl in that incident said they decided against filing charges at the time when the boys’ parents promised he would get counseling. In the light of the incidents last month, they asked prosecutors to reopen that 2015 case. [After SM East assault charges, parents of earlier victim regret not prosecuting — Kansas City Star] FROM OUR SPONSORS: SM East principal sends note to parents about offensive Homecoming sign. The SM East administration on Tuesday sent a note to parents alerting them that the school was aware of a photo of a freshman student holding a sign asking a date to Homecoming that included derogatory language. “Offensive language in any form will not be tolerated,” wrote principal John McKinney. “I want to assure you that appropriate action has been taken in accordance with school district policies.” Students said the sign contained a derogatory historical reference. Residents out safely in house fire. Overland Park and Consolidated Fire District No. 2 crews were called to a house fire in the 6000 block of Hemlock where a small fire in the basement of a single story home was found. Fire damage was contained in the ceiling above a basement bathroom. Overland Park Fire Department said it is believed to be electrical in origin. The fire was out in a few minutes and no injuries were reported. The location is west of SM North High School and east of Antioch. Roeland Park City Council approves raise for city administrator. The Roeland Park City Council approved a 6.5 percent raise for City Administrator Keith Moody following a special meeting Monday. Moody, who’s first anniversary on the job will be Oct. 12, had his salary increased from $96,000 to $102,000. Sexual assault victims can remain anonymous. A Johnson County judge has ruled that two victims of sexual assault can remain anonymous in their civil lawsuit against a Lenexa church. The girls allege the church knowingly allowed sex offender Kessler Lichtenegger, a former SM East student, to be around children. Lichtenneger pleaded guilty to charges and is serving a 17-year sentence. [Judge: Sexual assault victims can stay anonymous in suit against Lenexa church – The Kansas City Star] Roeland Park mayor welcomes Walmart remaining, but says it’s too early to talk about a property tax rollback. Roeland Park raised its property taxes three years ago to compensate for what then seemed to be the pending departure of Walmart to the Mission Gateway project. Walmart and associated businesses generate more than one-third of the sales taxes in the community. Those property tax increases remain in place, and a discussion on their future won’t occur until at least February when planning begins for the 2018 budget. “It will certainly be a topic of conversation,” Mayor Joel Marquardt said, “but it will be a tough decision.” The 2017 budget and its mill levy already have been approved. Prairie Village City Council approves new health insurance provider. The Prairie Village Council has approved United Health Care to the new insurer for the city’s 108 employees. The city had been using Blue Cross Blue Shield as its insurance carrier. Health insurance premium costs will rise 6 percent under the new contract, with the cost split between employees and the city.

Now It Needs New Retail Strategy Mark Bergen @mhbergen More stories by Mark Bergen and Mark Gurman @markgurman More stories by Mark Gurman October 5, 2016 — 6:00 AM EDT October 5, 2016 — 2:31 PM EDT Prior sales efforts with Nexus and Android Silver fizzled Some wireless carriers are wary of Google’s retail ability The Strategy Behind Google's Hardware Google unveiled new hardware from smartphones and smart speakers to wireless routers on Tuesday. It was a year-long odyssey that involved design, supply chain negotiations and the search for a manufacturing partner. Now the Alphabet Inc. unit must grapple with the equally daunting challenge of getting the gadgets to consumers. It has a history of retail strategies that either struggled or never got off the ground, according to people familiar with the company’s retail efforts. What’s more, it’s inexperienced dealing with returns and recycling. And unlike rival Apple Inc., the company lacks its own stores where it can showcase hardware as it pleases and instead relies on other companies’ in-store displays. This time, the stakes are higher because the latest gadgets are vehicles for Google’s digital assistant, a key product that is chasing Amazon.com Inc.’s Alexa and Apple’s Siri. "We view go-to-market as a clear hurdle to wide acceptance, which will require investments in brand, marketing and distribution to overcome," UBS analyst Eric Sheridan wrote in a note to investors. Google is selling the new Pixel phones at Verizon Communications Inc. and Best Buy Co. stores in the U.S., via its own online store, a temporary physical store in New York City and through its wireless service Project Fi. It’s working with a small number of other wireless carriers and retailers in countries including Germany and India. Google Home, the new speaker, is available at Best Buy, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Target Corp. stores, in addition to Google’s online store. Cutting distribution deals with a handful of carriers and retailers isn’t enough, according to Forrester Research analyst Thomas Husson. “Google will have to up its customer-service game and do many more distribution partnerships," he said. Many of Google’s past efforts at selling hardware have fizzled. When the company started its Nexus brand in 2010 it planned to market the phones online only, but sales never took off. About 200,000 of the first Nexus model sold, short of Google’s target of several million units, according to a person who worked on the device. Before that Nexus launch, Google planned unique software features for the device, such as voice-to-text services and maps navigation, but Verizon, the exclusive carrier partner, balked at the idea, this person said. Verizon spokeswoman Kelly Crummey declined to comment on the 2010 partnership. For the Pixel, the wireless carrier "worked with Google on what this phone would look like and the customer experience because it is available through us," she said.

Kicked off some time in 2014, the internal project was designed to sell high-end Android handsets with partners to compete with Apple. Google set up a retail lab for the effort, claiming an entire building near its Mountain View, California headquarters, according to former employees. But it never got off the ground. Nikesh Arora, Google’s sales chief at the time, drove the initiative. When he left in July 2014, Android Silver was shelved. One former Google executive called it a boondoggle. The former Googlers didn’t want to be identified discussing private information. A Google spokeswoman declined to comment. Apple Envy Such experiments are a contrast to Apple stores that are the envy of the retail industry. Apple considers the iPhone in terms of the product’s complete life cycle, from leaving the factory to when customers stop using the device. Apple offers a recycling program through physical and online stores. Google’s new smartphone unit approached potential wireless carrier partners early this year, according to a person familiar with the situation. Some carriers peppered Google executives with questions about handling phone returns and technical support, the person said. At the time, Google did not appear ready to take on these aspects of the phone hardware business, according to this person. Google executives on the hardware team say the company is on a "journey," gaining experience and capabilities with each smartphone generation. And Apple only began touting the iPhone’s full life cycle after a few generations. Responsible Returns On Tuesday, as a Google event began in San Francisco, new hardware chief Rick Osterloh reassured the audience that the company was serious about the move. “We’re in it for the long run,” he said. About nine months after initial talks with carriers, Google rolled out its flavor of technical support: Pixels have built-in chat support where customer-service reps can take over smartphone screens to identify problems. Google will be responsible for returns and recycling and is building a supply chain that can re-absorb faulty and rejected devices, Osterloh said in a recent interview. Osterloh will be partly judged by how many devices Google sells, a contrast to the Nexus program which showcased Android features for other handset makers to adopt. But the executive was still cagey about the company’s sales aspirations. "In markets where we do business, we’re definitely going to want meaningful share," he said. "But it’s highly unlikely that the primary driver will be to be in every market with as high as possible volume." Google still sees software as its edge, rather than retail distribution and customer service. The company spent more time on Tuesday talking about the digital assistant baked into its new gadgets, and how they work together.  If Google can get millions of people relying on its assistant, the company may be able to compete with Apple’s devices, according to Brian Blau, an analyst at Gartner. “The AI assistant will give them something that Apple has enjoyed for many years: Lock-in to the system," he said.

By Jonathan Berr MoneyWatch October 5, 2016, 5:30 AM How grocers wring extra cash out of shelf space Comment Share Tweet Stumble Email Most consumers who shop at a supermarket have no idea that the underneath the 42,000 items that are typically stocked is “real estate” that’s for sale to the highest bidder. That competition for shelf space creates a system that a nonprofit argues hurts consumers by thwarting new products from gaining a foothold in the market. A  recent report from the Center for Science and the Public Interest said some grocery real estate is more valuable than others, such as the candy aisle next to the checkout counters and displays at the end of an aisle. One sweet maker paid a chain $500,000 to place a single product next to its cash registers for a few months, according to a broker who was interviewed for the CSPI’s report. Another broker spent $17,000 for a one-time “event” at a 300-store chain, the CSPI said. An executive at a condiment company told the nonprofit that his firm pays between $5,000 and $20,000 per item in slotting fees. All told, food companies spend more than an estimated $50 billion in fees that guarantee their products will get placed on grocers’ shelves and promoted in advertising circulars, among other things, according to the CSPI report. That $50 billion estimate comes from research done by University of North Florida marketing professor Gregory Gundlach and a group of academics. Play Video CBS This Morning Behind the scenes of FreshDirect: Online grocer takes direct aim at supermarkets Giant retailers like Walmart and Amazon see groceries as the next frontier in e-commerce, but Vinita Nair takes you inside FreshDirect, an online... According to the report, “Working with other academics, Gundlach and his colleagues in the mid-2000s used what he called ‘leakage’ -- tidbits included in the footnotes of public filings and stray data points found in trade publications -- to estimate the amount of money manufacturers pay retailers each year.”   None of the executives the CSPI interviewed would speak for the record about the practice, which former grocery industry executive Mark Heckman described to the nonprofit as a “deep, dark secret of the retailing world,” a characterization the industry disputes. Gundlach’s research also found that food companies provide cases of free merchandise as part of these arrangements, which have gone on for years. In addition, chains have designated some products as a “category captain,” which enables them to dictate the layout of an entire food section where they already dominate. These arrangements are formalized in multiyear contracts. For some grocery chains, these fees “are a large part of their profits,” said Howard Davidowitz, chairman of the retail consultancy/investment banking firm Davidowitz & Associates. He added that traditional grocery chains count on them to bolster their razor-thin profit margins. “The biggest food suppliers do this,” said Davidowitz. John Stanton, a professor of food marketing at St. Joseph’s University in Philadelphia, noted that the big manufacturers pay slotting fees as a way to keep smaller producers out of the market. He estimates that 60 percent to 70 percent of grocers’ profits comes from these fees. In essence, he said, “They make more money when they buy food than when they sell food.” Play Video CBS Evening News With no Walmart, Texas town has no grocery store Walmart has closed 154 stores in 27 states, resulting in over 10,000 employee layoffs. Many of the stores that closed were the only source of gro... The practice, though, isn’t universal. Walmart (WMT), the country’s largest seller of groceries, doesn’t take slotting fees to stock merchandise, though it does take payments for stocking new products for the first time. Newer entrants to the grocery story market such as Aldi, which is undercutting Walmart on price, don’t accept the fees either. But given the fierce competition in the grocery business, Davidowitz expects them to fade over time. According to the Food Marketing Institute, a trade group representing the grocery chains, slotting fees vary depending on location, much like other costs such as wages and real estate, and were needed to help retailers facing an “explosion in the number of new products being brought to market.” The institute said these fees are legitimate. “The way slotting fees was presented by CSPI was misleading,” the trade group said. “It is not a shadowy backroom deal cut, but an openly discussed agreement to facilitate manufacturers helping retailers recoup the labor, spacing and shelving  costs entailed in marketing new product lines.” The CSPI argues that the fees prevent new entrants from competing fairly for the attention of shoppers. Take entrepreneur Jon Gordon, who shelled out tens of thousands of dollars to get his Clemmy’s sugar-free and gluten-free ice cream stocked at some Albertson’s and ShopRite locations but balked at paying $500,000 to gain access to the more than 400 Stop & Shops, which is owned by Netherlands-based Ahold Delhaize. Play Video CBS This Morning A closer look at supermarket prepared foods Prepared foods at grocery stores is now an almost $29 billion industry, growing twice as fast as overall grocery sales. A new Consumer Reports in... Gordon unsuccessfully sued Swiss-based Nestle, whose ice cream brands include Edy’s and Dreyers, for abusing its market position by forcing his products to the bottom of the freezer case, making them difficult for consumers to find. Clemmy’s filed for bankruptcy protection last year. “Between slotting fees and the category captain system, those two things alone make it almost impossible for a smaller manufacturer to make it,” Gordon said in a CSPI statement. The Grocery Manufacturers Association declined to comment for this story. The CSPI called on the Federal Trade Commission to investigate the issue. An FTC spokeswoman didn’t respond to a request for comment. Public health advocates have long argued that these fees result in less healthy food choices getting more promotion than healthier choices and are exacerbating the nation’s obesity epidemic. “Study after study has shown us that it matters where food is placed, and matters a lot,” said Mary Story, associate director for Academic Programs at the Duke Global Health Institute, in a CSPI statement. © 2016 CBS Interactive Inc..

Buy her frozen yogurt or ice cream. Photo by: Ashley Alonzo This always seems to work, because who doesn’t love a cup of peach wave or a cone of ice cream? 2. Movie night Photo by: Ashley Alonzo Movie night does not need to be a fancy date at the movies. Lay up in bed and watch Netflix, or rent some movies -- either way your girl will feel the attention. 3. Get her some flowers Photo by: Ashley Alonzo Flowers brighten anyone’s day, and the best part: You can buy them for less than 5 dollars at Walmart. However, the important thing is not how much they cost, but the intention you give them with. 4. She likes candy Photo by: Ashley Alonzo We all have a favorite candy! Getting your girl her favorite candy would make her mood from -1 to +110 in less than three seconds. 5. Be loving Photo by: Ashley Alonzo Affection is what most of the girls want from their partner. Therefore, showing her some love by giving her kisses and hugs as well as joking around can make her day better. 6. Massages always work Photo by: Ashley Alonzo Even if your girl is not sore, a massage on the back is always nice. Let’s not forget our students are mostly athletes, so massages always come in clutch. 7. Encourage and support her Photo by: Ashley Alonzo As athletes, our number one rule includes our partner supporting our home games. We want that cheerleader on our side! You do not have to go all out, but we appreciate you being there. So there you have it. If you really want to impress, show your girl how much she means to you, and be her shelter when she is struggling. Don’t hesitate to do at least two things from this list!

If someone looks even the slightest bit interested, he takes it off, hands it to them and replaces it. The small, private Catholic school enlisted Briscoe, a seasoned educator going on 31 years as a principal, in July. Since then, there’s been a notable shift in the school environment. According to science teacher Brent Zabel, there’s been a lack of support for staff regarding communication and organization in the past. But with some team building exercises and a Friday Focus letter filled with reflection and motivational words, he said Briscoe has already been a positive influence on the staff. “There’s been a complete change in the teachers’ mindset of coming in teaching and being proud of the school, coming in with more enthusiasm,” Zabel said. “It’s definitely a breath of fresh air.” Zabel said one of the new principal’s big assets is knowing what ideas work due to his experience as well as having connections to bring in resources and notable speakers. Or, as Briscoe puts it, he’s got a lot of chips that he can cash in. Briscoe previously served as principal at Hill-Murray School in Maplewood and was the founding principal of Century High School in Rochester, the latter of which his four now-adult children attended under his reign. In 2012, his wife Cindy was in a car accident that she managed to survive, but put her out of work as a longtime teacher at Roosevelt Elementary. Briscoe said he thought he would be working at Wal-Mart as a greeter from then on out, but instead, it “took three miracles” to get to Hill-Murray. Then, in January 2014, she underwent surgery for a grim cancer diagnosis that was successful. Just one week before he was about to sell the house to move closer to Hill-Murray in May, the cancer came back. When he thought he couldn’t be a caregiver with a long commute, a desired principal position opened up at BA, nine miles from his home. “Through a lot of prayer and gut wrenching, I thought I’d take a shot,” he said. “It kind of fulfilled my dream. I’m in charge of myself [as principal and president] for the first time in my life.” Over the summer, Briscoe said he looked at a yearbook and practiced memorizing student names and matching it to their faces. It has not gone unnoticed by students, including 10th grader Tori Pavel, who has attended BA since preschool. “He’s always in the halls greeting everyone, he’s really trying to get to know everyone,” said Pavel. “There’s a little bit more uplifting in the school.” On the first day, Briscoe handed out cookies to students as they were dropped off and had a red carpet rolled out for them to walk and take pictures. At lunch, a polka band played in the cafeteria. “A good school is almost like a family. We take care of each other, we notice each other,” he said. “It’s the little things that we do or don’t do that separates the good schools from the great ones.” Briscoe said that beyond providing a safe and caring environment, his priorities for schools are all about relationships. He identified communication, consistency, collaboration and compassion as the ideals he wants to be known for. As for academics, the new principal is having juniors take practice ACT exams to boost the school’s composite score of 23, while aiming to implement an agricultural program by next year. Many students live on farms, he said, and it would make BA one of those unique private schools with a program like that. Briscoe is also pushing for more classes that earn college credit for students, which Zabel said would offer him a wider network and community of teachers that would then improve his own teaching. He said he’s starting to reach out to other private Catholic schools in the region and wants to boost enrollment and endowment for their school of nearly 300 students, of which about half rely on some level of scholarship. “I’m super excited to see what we’re going to accomplish under his leadership,” said Laura Carlson, BA’s director of guidance counseling. “He’s got great vision for our school.” Briscoe's first few months seem to have made an impression. As he continues to greet students by name in the hallway with a cup of coffee and implement changes at BA, his wife is still fighting the cancer while hoping to make it to their 40th anniversary in April. “We look at time so differently now,” he said. “From this point forward, we're driving the car and looking out the front window.” Reach Reporter Ida Mojadad at 507-333-3135 or follow her on Twitter @APGidamojadad.

Snapdeal is also preparing to raise fresh capital to defend its turf.  The high stakes battle between Flipkart's Big Billion Day sales bonanza, Amazon's Great Indian Festival sale and Snapdeal's own initiative dubbed the Unbox Diwali Sale, means employees at all three players are working marathon hours to meet stiff sales targets.  "Our teams are working around the clock during Big Billion Days," said a spokesperson for Flipkart, adding that many are camping out in office for the week, and working 14-18 hour days in a bid to keep up with frenzied demand.  All three companies say their sales seasons have so far been successful, but did not comment on how the sales momentum is stacking up against their own internal targets.  Flipkart says it sold 2.25 million units in the first 12 hours of its five-day sale, which kicked off on Sunday.  Its closest competitor Amazon India said it sold 1.5 million units in the first 12 hours of its sale that began on Saturday. Amazon said its first day of sales was three times higher than the corresponding first day sales last year while second day sales were five times higher.  Snapdeal said more than 2 million users logged in on the first hour of its sales, leading to more than 180 orders per second at launch.  "With companies under pressure to make money, they don't want to let the opportunity go to a competitor...you can't keep burning cash by offering huge discounts," said Devangshu Dutta, chief executive of retail consultancy Third Eyesight. — Reuters You May Be Interested German minister says Facebook should be treated as a media company Google, an Obama ally, may face policy setbacks under Trump Airbnb, San Francisco must work harder to resolve lawsuit: judge Malaysia intervenes to help sagging ringgit: official China badminton star Lin Dan apologises for affair with model while wife was pregnant Rejuvenate yourself with American ginseng Others Also Read England players earn 22,000 pounds, Fiji's get 400 Billionaire Widjaja family puts Singapore on the spot The Star's executive editor Soo Ewe Jin passes away advertisement Latest News US extends ZTE reprieve on exports curbs until Feb 27 Tesla's Musk closes SolarCity deal, more challenges lie ahead Google, an Obama ally, may face policy setbacks under Trump Infosys CEO says Trump election may weigh on margins Toyota sharpens focus on electric cars through new in-house unit Most Viewed in Tech Beware!
