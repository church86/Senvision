money transfer pricing option News provided by MoneyGram Oct 25, 2016, 17:51 ET Share this article DALLAS, Oct. 25, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- MoneyGram (NASDAQ: MGI) announced today a new cross border money transfer product for Walmart customers sending from any U.S. Walmart location to any Walmart Mexico location. Walmart2Walmart Mexico powered by MoneyGram is a new service that offers customers a $6.50* transfer fee when sending between $51 to $800. Customers can send money from over 4,500 Walmart locations in the U.S. to more than 1,250 Walmart locations in Mexico; including all Bodega Aurrera, Mi Bodega Aurrera, and Superama locations. "Our new Walmart2Walmart Mexico product is a big positive and offers MoneyGram and Walmart customers exceptional service at a great value when they need to send money to friends and family in Mexico.  MoneyGram and Walmart work side-by-side each day to ensure our customers are receiving the financial services they depend on at an affordable price," said Alex Holmes, MoneyGram's chief executive officer. "This new product along with other recent MoneyGram and Walmart initiatives, demonstrates our shared commitment to each other and to making money transfers easier and more affordable for customers and their families in the U.S. and Mexico." The U.S. to Mexico corridor is the largest country-to-country remittance corridor in the world. According to the World Bank, more than $24 billion was sent from the U.S. to Mexico in 2015.  Most customers make money transfers for family support purposes or special occasions such as religious festivals or emergency transfers. Forbes recently reported that in 2015 remittances overtook oil as the leading source of foreign income in Mexico. In addition to today's announcement, last month MoneyGram and Walmart launched the upgraded Walmart.Moneygram.com site built on the MTaaS platform (Money Transfer as a Service).  MoneyGram has since branded this new state-of-the-art online money transfer technology as 'MoneyGram Kameleon™'.  MoneyGram Kameleon extends the same innovative and convenient services as MoneyGram's award-winning website, moneygram.com, to business partners through a co-branded experience. Separately, with the recent expansion of Walmart's white-label U.S.-to-U.S. funds transfer product into higher transaction bands, MoneyGram is adjusting its money transfer pricing structure in these bands for U.S.-to-U.S. transactions originated at Walmart. The new pricing structure provides customers with a flat fee for all transfers between $900 and $2,500. *In addition to the transfer fee, a currency exchange rate may also apply. MoneyGram also makes money from currency exchange. #moneygramnews About MoneyGram International, Inc.

Walmex, as the unit of Bentonville, Ark.-based Wal-Mart Stores Inc. is known, reported a profit of 10.05 billion Mexican pesos ($543 million) in the three months through September, compared with 5.92 billion pesos in the year-earlier quarter. Net profit from continuing operations rose 17% from a year before to 6.7 billion pesos. Walmex agreed in August to sell clothing store chain Suburbia to department store operator El Puerto de Liverpool SAB for around $1 billion. Sales rose 11% to 126.86 billion pesos, while earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, a measure of operating cash flow, rose 12% to 11.79 billion pesos. The median estimate of analysts polled by The Wall Street Journal called for net profit of 6.59 billion pesos on sales of 127.15 billion pesos, and Ebitda of 11.94 billion pesos. Walmex shares closed down 0.4% on the Mexican stock exchange ahead of the report. The Mexican economy has been growing below potential and is expected to expand just over 2% this year, while retail sales have remained robust, increasing 8.3% in the first eight months. Retailers cite the positive impact of job creation, consumer credit and growth in remittances from Mexicans living abroad, which are boosted in peso terms by a weaker local currency. On the other hand, inflation crept above the central bank's 3% target in mid-October, while consumer confidence has sunk to multiyear lows in part because of the sharp peso depreciation.

Most people against Walmart say it will hurt local business. Well, I am having a hard time thinking of any local businesses that sell anything that most hard-working residents and families need at prices we can afford. My wife and I have three young daughters. We both work hard and struggle to pay our mortgage and bills. What we need is one place to get our children's clothes, toys, school supplies and many other items from electronics to household and bath items at affordable prices. Berkshire Crossing is ideal but difficult to get to for many and a traffic nightmare. Not to mention it is not pedestrian friendly. We also have very little extra time, staying busy with after school activities, homework, dinner and the everyday craziness life throws at us. One-stop shopping is ideal these days. We do not live in the days Mom stays home and has the time to shop all around town going to one store for clothes and another for school supplies and running all over town for different items. Walmart will be cleaning up an empty eyesore and spending the money to prepare a site not wanted by any other business and creating a space which will attract other businesses. As far as jobs go. A job is a job. I would rather work at Walmart than not work at all. We live in a low income housing neighborhood and see the effects of welfare abuse and unemployment everyday. I understand the need for jobs in Pittsfield. We need to take what we can get. We cannot live in the fantasy world of a new age GE type company coming here. Without easy access to the Mass. Turnpike large manufacturing companies won't even look at Pittsfield. Finally, downtown. Downtown Inc. and the city of Pittsfield need to realize the glory days of shopping North Street are over. Let North Street have its theaters, bars, nightclubs, restaurants, coffee shops and fancy hotels and rename it the entertainment district.

BARCELONA, Spain—Walmart, the world largest retailer and one the largest employers, aims to give back to the OpenStack community. In a session at the OpenStack Summit here, Andrew Mitry, lead architect for Walmart's OpenStack effort, and Megan Rossetti, part of the OpenStack Operations team at Walmart, detailed how the open-source model is working for the retail giant. Mitry explained that Walmart started on its OpenStack journey four years ago with a proof of concept (PoC) deployment. That original PoC made use of leftover and idle hardware as an initial test case for Walmart. The PoC was successful and now OpenStack has helped transform the way Walmart works. "Today, 100 percent of our e-commerce runs on OpenStack," Mitry said. "We are now focused on transitioning our retail back-office workloads onto OpenStack, as well." Mitry noted that now it's not just web applications that Walmart is moving to OpenStack, but a lot of data intensive applications, as well. "[OpenStack] has become the de facto cloud platform within Walmart," Mitry said. Today Walmart is running 170,000 computing cores on OpenStack, but perhaps even more noteworthy is the fact that Walmart is not just a consumer of open-source; it is also active contributor with more than 60 open-source projects. Among the open-source projects that Walmart has started are OneOps,an application lifecycle management platform. Walmart has also developed the Electrode node.js application platform as an open-source effort. Open-source activity is not a side job for Walmart's IT staff but rather is considered to be part of day-to-day operations. Additionally, Mitry noted that developers are recognized for their open-source contributions. "Large companies that have been around for a while have awards for patents and other innovations," Mitry said. "We actually now have company awards around open-source contributions." Rossetti noted that open-source is now also part of the overall management process with goal setting for employees on open-source contributions. Additionally, as new developers come to Walmart, the company includes open-source contribution training as part of the on-boarding process. "One of our goals is to make it as seamless as possible to push open-source code out the door," Mitry said. By embracing open-source, Mitry commented that it has also helped Walmart attract developer talent to the company as well as helping retain existing developers. The overall culture chain in support of open source has helped generate a lot of excitement and energy for Walmart's developers. So, instead of developers thinking that the work they are doing will be hidden inside a big company and never noticed, code has a wider impact and developers are part of a larger ecosystem of open-source contributions. Additionally, Mitry noted that even though Walmart is a large company, individual development teams might still be small, so being part of a larger community is helpful. "It's not just 'hey I'm doing this little thing inside of this big company that no one notices,'" Mitry said. "[Open-source] creates excitement in what developers are doing, in being able to share it and talk about and even have other people contribute and use the code outside of the company.

(Walmart.com) NEW YORK — Walmart has removed a Halloween costume accessory from its website after it stirred controversy online about suicide. The retail giant had been selling “razor blade suicide scar wound latex costume make up” online for $3.99. The accessory depicts two cuts and a razor blade in the person’s hand. Outrage over the costume prompted a Change.org petition to stop Walmart from selling the item. “This is not just a disgrace to the sensitivity to those who suffer from self-harm, but a shame on Walmart for making light of the situation,” part of the petition read. “This ‘costume’ is real life for many people, many people who are contemplating volumes higher than self-harm. Suicide is not a joke, not a costume, and not funny.” Several Twitter users also reached out to the company to voice their distaste for the costume. @Walmart suicide isn't a costume. stop glamorizing mental illness and self-harm. it is far from it. — beanette (@kittyjnicks) October 23, 2016 Hey @Walmart what's the deal? Think it's funny to joke about self harming? How dare you. pic.twitter.com/0gcaNH1j05 — Jessica Shaw (@JessiBooShaw) October 25, 2016 @Walmart a suicide Halloween makeup kit, seriously? Mental health is not a joke to sell for a quick buck. WILL NEVER SHOP HERE AGAIN — Aretina (@aretina01) October 25, 2016 The petition gained hundreds of signatures before Walmart pulled the item from the online store. “The costume is appalling and it was unacceptable for a third-party seller to list it on our marketplace. It clearly violated our prohibited items policy and we removed it yesterday morning when it was brought to our attention,” Walmart said in a statement. Related stories Funny or distasteful?

Responding to Food Safety Concerns, Walmart Invests $25 Million in China by Leon Kaye on Tuesday, Oct 25th, 2016 Corporate Responsibility Share Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) A Walmart in Shenzhen, China. Walmart pegs its future growth on the sales from stores in China, but glimpses into those outlets’ recent financial performance suggests such hopes are disappearing. Much of Walmart’s struggles can be attributed to China’s cooling economy and fickle consumers who found that Walmart’s offerings did not necessarily match their tastes. But food contamination scandals, such as the 2011 pork mislabeling fiasco and the tainted donkey meat scare that rocked the company almost three years ago, significantly contribute to the challenges the world’s largest retailer confronts in the world’s most populous country. To that end, Walmart announced this week that it will invest at least $25 million in food safety research. The retailer promised to revamp its supply chain while assuring nervous customers that its food products are safe. The company’s corporate headquarters and its foundation, along with IBM and Beijing’s Tsinghua University, will partner together to improve food authentication systems and the tracking of the company’s supply chain. Much of the focus will be on the safety of poultry, 12.7 million tons of which are expected to be consumed in China this year, trailing only pork as the nation’s most popular source of animal protein. Key to the securing of Walmart’s food supplies is the use of blockchain, an automated database system that digitally tracks food items from farmers to food processors, distributors and eventually store shelves. With blockchain, supply chain managers can seamlessly track everything remotely in a ledger, from expiration dates to warehouse temperatures – and such technology is designed so that it is nearly impossible to alter. This program will be monitored by staff at the new Walmart Food Safety Collaboration Center in Beijing, where they will be joined by researchers from the University of Arkansas. In addition to the supply chain technology investment, staff at this center will also research food-borne contaminants, as well as develop a food safety risk assessment model that will eventually be available to other companies and organizations worldwide. The staff will also test new technologies that can improve poultry safety across China. Walmart really had no choice but to ramp up its spending on food safety measures, as the country’s government implemented stricter food inspection and safety measures last fall. This commitment builds upon Walmart’s spending on food safety in China, which after the donkey meat scandal, reportedly tripled to almost $50 million by 2015. The combined amount of money Walmart spent on food safety is not huge when one considers the size of China’s grocery market and its fierce competitiveness. Estimates suggest China’s total grocery sector is worth an estimated $1 trillion to $1.6 trillion, and Walmart faces plenty of rivals including Tesco, Carrefour, Bailan and Wumart. Add the increasing popularity of e-commerce in China, and Walmart has a long road ahead if it is going to regain the trust of Chinese consumers in a challenging economic climate.

(NYSE:WMT) Consensus Estimates Update: Consensus Vs. Actual By William Abels - October 24, 2016 SHARE Facebook Twitter In looking at Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT)’s latest quarterly report, we can see that 10 analysts had expected that the firm would post earnings of $1.02 for the period ending on 2016-07-31.  On 2016-08-18, the firm reported actual earnings of $1.07 for fiscal Q2 representing an EPS surprise amount in per share dollar terms of $0.05.  Just prior to the release, analyst’s estimates had a standard deviation of 0.03.  Looking ahead to the next fiscal quarter, Wall Street analysts are expecting earnings per share of 0.96 for the period closing on 2016-10-31. This is the Zacks Consensus estimate calculated as the arithmetic average of all the individual analyst EPS estimates according to their own proprietary methodology (BNRI Accounting).  Investors are expecting that Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) will issue their earnings release on or around 2016-11-17. In comparing the results to the same quarter a year ago, the firm posted earnings of $1.03 for the period which endend on 2015-10-31. Analyst Sentiment Leading up to the next earnings announcements investors should pay close attention to the analysts sentiment on the stock and which direction they are revising their estimates.  Over the past 6 months 5 sell-side analysts have lowered their long term earnings per share estimates on the stock.  During that same period 3 analysts have increased their earnings expectations for the firm.  So what does this mean?  Typically if a large percentage of analysts lower their revisions, the company is more likely to disappoint the Street.  If a large number of brokerage firms increase estimates prior to earnings, the company is more likely to impress with their numbers. Looking ahead to long term projections, Zacks has calculated a long term mean estimate of 3.71.  This is the best estimate for both revenue and earnings over the next three to five years.  Three months ago this number stood at 4.34. Analyst Price Targets Now turning to where analysts believe Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) shares are headed.  According to the 19 analysts covering the shares, the consensus price target stands at $75.042.  The standard deviation of all estimates is $8.723.  The most aggressive analyst on the name has a price target of $90.  The analyst with the most bearish outlook on the stock has a target price of $50.  The latest analyst revision was recorded on 2016-10-21. Each of the 19 covering analysts have also provided a Buy, Sell or Hold recommendation on the stock.  As of 2016-10-23, 7 have a Strong Buy rating on the stock, 0 have a Buy rating, 9 have a Hold rating and 0 have a Sell or Strong Sell.  Taking a look back three months ago to compare sentiment, at that time 4 had a Strong Buy, 0 had a Buy, 13 had a Hold and 0 had a sell rating.  Zacks breaks all of the recommendations down into a integer based number in order to get an average recommendation rating on the stock.  The scale is on a 1 to 5 basis where 1 represents a Strong Buy and 5 a Strong Sell.  Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) has a mean recommendation of 2.58.  In looking at the historical ratings numbers we can see that the stock had a mean rating of 2.75 one month ago, 2.88 two months ago and 2.79 three months ago.    William Abels LEAVE A REPLY Cancel reply Latest Netflix Up More Than 3% October 5, 2016 Red Robin Gourmet Burgers Closes Fast-Casual Prototypes as Part of “Strategic...

These eight of its largest 20 holdings are beating the market. Beth McKenna (TMFMcKenna) Oct 24, 2016 at 7:42PM Image source: The Motley Fool. Legendary investor Warren Buffett, chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B), has led the holding company to outperform the S&P 500 by an average of 11.1% from 1965 through 2015. Just one hundred dollars invested in Berkshire in 1965 would be worth $1.1 million today. Investors can get in on the Oracle of Omaha's stock-picking prowess by buying shares in Berkshire Hathaway or by buying shares of the public companies in its portfolio. At the end of the second quarter, Berkshire held shares of 44 such companies, with only 20 accounting for more than 0.5% of its total stock portfolio.  Buffet is beating the broader market so far in 2016, with Berkshire's Class A shares (the super-pricey ones) and B shares (the ones most investors would buy) up 9.4% and 9.2%, respectively, compared with the S&P 500's 6.2% total return. The following eight of Berkshire's largest 20 public holdings have outperformed the broader market so far in 2016. Rank   Company           Market Cap                     Weight Within Berkshire Portfolio (at end of Q2) Dividend Yield 2016 YTD Total Return                10-Year Total Return 1 The Kraft Heinz Company  $107.8B 22.2% 3.3% 24.3% N/A* 2 Deere & Company  $27.2B 1.4% 2.8% 15.8% 144% 3 IBM  $147.6B 9.5% 3.5% 15.5% 122% 4 Wal-Mart Stores  $211.7B 2.3% 2.9% 14.1% 78.4% 5 Apple  $633.8B 1.1% 1.9% 13.7% 1,100% 6 Verizon Communications  $205B 0.64% 4.5% 13.7% 122% 7 Moody's Corp.  $20.6B 1.8% 1.4% 8% 95.8% 8 Visa  $194.7B 0.58% 0.7% 6.9% N/A**   Berkshire Hathaway Overall $355.7B / $355.5B  --   9.4% / 9.2%  119% / 119%    S&P 500     2.07%  6.2% 93.6% Data sources: SEC filing and YCharts. Market caps and return data to Oct. 14. * Kraft Heinz began trading on July 6, 2015; it's returned 26.8% since then vs. the S&P 500's 6%. **Visa began trading in March 2008; it's returned 519% since then vs. the S&P 500's 98%.    Warren Buffett's best-performing stocks to avoid First up is Wal-Mart Stores (NYSE:WMT). While the discount retailer's financial performance and stock-price performance have perked up in 2016, there's no reason to believe, in my opinion, that the stock will beat the market again over any significant period. Quite simply, Amazon.com has been eating Wal-Mart's lunch, as folks increasingly embrace not only online shopping, but online shopping at Amazon in particular.  For the first six months of calendar year 2016 (Wal-Mart's fiscal 2017), the retailer's revenue edged up 0.7% as reported and 3.4% in constant currency from the year-ago period. Meanwhile, its operating income for this period declined 2.6% as reported and 0.1% in constant currency, and adjusted earnings per share declined nearly 3%.  For the full year, analysts expect revenue to increase 1%, but adjusted EPS to fall 5.4%.  Most buy-and-hold investors should also pass on agricultural equipment titan Deere & Company (NYSE:DE). Its returns listed in the chart conceal the fact that it's an extremely volatile cyclical stock, meaning its fortunes are largely tied to the macroeconomic environment. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but making money in such stocks even over the long haul depends a lot upon the timing of your buys. In fact, Deere's price is still lower than it was at its all-time high about eight years ago. Moreover, the company continues to struggle -- year-over-year revenue and earnings per share dropped 8% and nearly 25%, respectively, in the first half of 2016 -- because agricultural industry fundamentals remain weak.   Warren Buffett's best-performing stocks worth buying What stocks are worth buying largely depends upon your primary objective. Verizon, IBM, and Kraft Heinz -- with their 4.5%, 3.5%, and 3.3% dividend yields -- are solid choices for income-seeking investors. Visa is an attractive choice for investors most focused on stock-price appreciation. Its recent acquisition of its Visa Europe unit should help bolster its competitive position against MasterCard, while its recent deal with online-payments giant PayPal provides additional growth potential. Under this deal, PayPal will promote Visa as a payment option and stop encouraging customers to link bank accounts rather than using Visa cards as funding choices.  The best buy for most investors from a long-term total return basis (stock-price appreciation + dividend yield), however, is Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).  Apple Image source: Apple. Buffet bought an initial stake in Apple in the first quarter and came back for more shares in the second quarter. He obviously saw value in this humongous long-term winner, with its share price down from its all-time high set in early 2015.  Apple's stock is down more than 12% from its all-time high, as of Oct. 21. It had been down even more, but it's had a nice run-up in price over the past quarter thanks largely to posting better-than-expected fiscal third-quarter results, the positive buzz surrounding last month's launch of the iPhone 7, and rival Samsung's halting production of its Galaxy Note 7 smartphone earlier this month after several phones overheated and caught on fire. The core reason behind Apple stock's recent struggles is simple: The company's revenue has been declining because quarterly year-over-year sales of the iPhone have been declining -- and the iconic smartphone accounts for about two-thirds of the company's top line. Falling revenue has hurt profit growth, as is typical. With Apple's stock trading at a reasonable 13.1 times forward earnings, there are reasons to believe that the market is providing long-term-focused investors with a buying opportunity. Apple is a company with "innovation" programmed into its genes. Granted, co-founder and former CEO Steve Jobs had a huge part in this, but no leader of a company of any significant size is fully responsible for its success. Couple the company's creative chops and cult-like following with its status as a cash-generating machine – it currently has $62.6 billion in cash and equivalents on its balance sheet – and it seems reasonable to assume that the iPhone won't be Apple's last huge winner. Apple's had modest success with its Apple Watch, but the fast-growing wearables category is still relatively new, so there's surely more growth opportunity here. Moreover, Apple is reportedly working on developing technology for a driverless car, and it wouldn't surprise me if it made a big splash in the nascent virtual-reality market in the near future. There will never be a shortage of new technologies ripe for a company like Apple to wrap in consumer-friendly packages to help drive mass consumer adoption, as it did with the smartphone.

These eight of its largest 20 holdings are beating the market. Beth McKenna (TMFMcKenna) Oct 24, 2016 at 7:42PM Image source: The Motley Fool. Legendary investor Warren Buffett, chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B), has led the holding company to outperform the S&P 500 by an average of 11.1% from 1965 through 2015. Just one hundred dollars invested in Berkshire in 1965 would be worth $1.1 million today. Investors can get in on the Oracle of Omaha's stock-picking prowess by buying shares in Berkshire Hathaway or by buying shares of the public companies in its portfolio. At the end of the second quarter, Berkshire held shares of 44 such companies, with only 20 accounting for more than 0.5% of its total stock portfolio.  Buffet is beating the broader market so far in 2016, with Berkshire's Class A shares (the super-pricey ones) and B shares (the ones most investors would buy) up 9.4% and 9.2%, respectively, compared with the S&P 500's 6.2% total return. The following eight of Berkshire's largest 20 public holdings have outperformed the broader market so far in 2016.

Market caps and return data to Oct. 14. * Kraft Heinz began trading on July 6, 2015; it's returned 26.8% since then vs. the S&P 500's 6%. **Visa began trading in March 2008; it's returned 519% since then vs. the S&P 500's 98%.    Warren Buffett's best-performing stocks to avoid First up is Wal-Mart Stores (NYSE:WMT). While the discount retailer's financial performance and stock-price performance have perked up in 2016, there's no reason to believe, in my opinion, that the stock will beat the market again over any significant period. Quite simply, Amazon.com has been eating Wal-Mart's lunch, as folks increasingly embrace not only online shopping, but online shopping at Amazon in particular.  For the first six months of calendar year 2016 (Wal-Mart's fiscal 2017), the retailer's revenue edged up 0.7% as reported and 3.4% in constant currency from the year-ago period. Meanwhile, its operating income for this period declined 2.6% as reported and 0.1% in constant currency, and adjusted earnings per share declined nearly 3%.  For the full year, analysts expect revenue to increase 1%, but adjusted EPS to fall 5.4%.  Most buy-and-hold investors should also pass on agricultural equipment titan Deere & Company (NYSE:DE). Its returns listed in the chart conceal the fact that it's an extremely volatile cyclical stock, meaning its fortunes are largely tied to the macroeconomic environment. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but making money in such stocks even over the long haul depends a lot upon the timing of your buys. In fact, Deere's price is still lower than it was at its all-time high about eight years ago. Moreover, the company continues to struggle -- year-over-year revenue and earnings per share dropped 8% and nearly 25%, respectively, in the first half of 2016 -- because agricultural industry fundamentals remain weak.   Warren Buffett's best-performing stocks worth buying What stocks are worth buying largely depends upon your primary objective. Verizon, IBM, and Kraft Heinz -- with their 4.5%, 3.5%, and 3.3% dividend yields -- are solid choices for income-seeking investors. Visa is an attractive choice for investors most focused on stock-price appreciation. Its recent acquisition of its Visa Europe unit should help bolster its competitive position against MasterCard, while its recent deal with online-payments giant PayPal provides additional growth potential. Under this deal, PayPal will promote Visa as a payment option and stop encouraging customers to link bank accounts rather than using Visa cards as funding choices.  The best buy for most investors from a long-term total return basis (stock-price appreciation + dividend yield), however, is Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).  Apple Image source: Apple. Buffet bought an initial stake in Apple in the first quarter and came back for more shares in the second quarter. He obviously saw value in this humongous long-term winner, with its share price down from its all-time high set in early 2015.  Apple's stock is down more than 12% from its all-time high, as of Oct. 21. It had been down even more, but it's had a nice run-up in price over the past quarter thanks largely to posting better-than-expected fiscal third-quarter results, the positive buzz surrounding last month's launch of the iPhone 7, and rival Samsung's halting production of its Galaxy Note 7 smartphone earlier this month after several phones overheated and caught on fire. The core reason behind Apple stock's recent struggles is simple: The company's revenue has been declining because quarterly year-over-year sales of the iPhone have been declining -- and the iconic smartphone accounts for about two-thirds of the company's top line. Falling revenue has hurt profit growth, as is typical. With Apple's stock trading at a reasonable 13.1 times forward earnings, there are reasons to believe that the market is providing long-term-focused investors with a buying opportunity. Apple is a company with "innovation" programmed into its genes. Granted, co-founder and former CEO Steve Jobs had a huge part in this, but no leader of a company of any significant size is fully responsible for its success. Couple the company's creative chops and cult-like following with its status as a cash-generating machine – it currently has $62.6 billion in cash and equivalents on its balance sheet – and it seems reasonable to assume that the iPhone won't be Apple's last huge winner. Apple's had modest success with its Apple Watch, but the fast-growing wearables category is still relatively new, so there's surely more growth opportunity here. Moreover, Apple is reportedly working on developing technology for a driverless car, and it wouldn't surprise me if it made a big splash in the nascent virtual-reality market in the near future. There will never be a shortage of new technologies ripe for a company like Apple to wrap in consumer-friendly packages to help drive mass consumer adoption, as it did with the smartphone.

(Handout/Chatham Daily News) Tweet Change text size for the story Print Report an error When Carol Evans Henley picked up her mail at her Chatham residence Friday, she was surprised to find a card indicating she qualified for $100 in free gas. The mailing instructed her to call 1-844-889-3329 by Nov. 7, 2016 to claim her prize. When she spoke to an agent, she was told she would also receive $500 in free groceries at "Superstore or Canadian Tire." But, there was a catch. "They said I had to pay $1.95 on any debit card or credit card or Walmart card," Evans Henley told The Chatham Daily News Monday. She offered to send a cheque for $1.95, which was turned down. "They said they needed a credit, debit or Walmart number immediately to claim the prize ... or I would lose it," she said. Since Evans Henley doesn't give out her personal banking information over the telephone, four different agents tried a multitude of tactics, she said. "The first guy said the calls were recorded and he would not cheat me. "A second guy I spoke to gave me a different (company) name. "The third guy told me he was from Walmart Superstore," Evans Henley said. During the conversations, she heard background noise making her believe the toll free number had connected her to a large call centre. The mailing stated she was one of only 40 people who qualified for this offer. A fourth agent insisted the notice was sent on behalf of "Reward Centre of Walmart and Shopping Discounts.ca," she said. "Oddly, I have no account with these people," Evans Henley said. After contacting her local Walmart, Canadian Tire and Great Canadian Superstore, she confirmed none of the companies made any such offer. "I talked to several of my neighbours and no one else received this mailing," she said. "I think it's a fraud ... I sent the card with a statement to Chatham-Kent police. "I want to warn the public about this," she added. "This woman did the right thing by first of all realizing that she didn’t even have a rewards card with any of these companies," said Const. Renee Cowell. "Scammers prey on your emotions and try to illicit a quick response before you have a chance to think it through," Cowell added. She said receiving mail that you have won a prize, or in this case qualified for free gas, happens more often than one might think. "The Chatham-Kent Police Service would like to remind everyone that the mail system is a common way for fraudsters to initiate contact with potential victims," Cowell said. Law enforcement agencies urge people to report scams to the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre (CAFC). The centre has reported receiving information on over 25 different types of scams where contact is made through the mail. Cowell said there are never any fees or taxes to be paid in Canada "if you have truly won a prize."

We’re used to seeing victims of tragic accidents, violent events in history, paranormal attacks, and even poor judgment; the blood and gore get more realistic with every passing year. But Walmart may have gone too far this time, at least according to those who think suicide scar and wound accessories are crossing the line. The fake scars were part of Walmart’s massive Halloween make-up collection of latex applications intended to look like everything from vampire bat attacks (that old trick of putting two red dots on your neck went out with the 20th century) to the modern day zombie apocalypse. But those events are nothing compared to what’s scaring some mental health advocates. Walmart.com’s ‘Razor Blade Suicide Scar Wound Latex Costume Make Up’ portrayed someone holding up a razor blade to fresh cuts on a forearm. You know, the kind of injuries people in deep depression or despair sometimes create on the worst days of their loved ones’ lives. Scarymommy.com posted ‘Hey Walmart, Suicide Is Not a Costume,’ telling the retail giant suicide is neither a joke or a costume: “Apparently Wal-Mart thinks suicide’s a joke. This year, their Halloween store is selling a latex prosthetic of slit wrists called ‘Razor Blade Suicide Scar Wound Latex Costume Make Up.’ The photo featured in the ad shows the deep wounds, two in number. But there’s more: The product listing not only shows the prosthetic, it depicts a suicide attempt. Poised at the end of one of the slashes is a hand holding a razor blade — not included in costume. Its occasion is listed as ‘Party.'” A petition on Change.org called for Walmart to drop the item from its inventory and, apparently, Walmart listened. ‘Razor Blade Suicide Scar Wound Latex Costume Make Up’ was removed completely from the website, with Walmart issuing this statement: “This costume is appalling and it was unacceptable for a third-party seller to list it on our marketplace. It clearly violated our prohibited items policy and we removed it when it was brought to our attention.” However, other vendors have kept the product, saying there’s nothing wrong with it — it’s just that Walmart did a poor job of describing it. Oh. THAT was the problem. Totally Costumes produces the product, according to The Mighty, and issued this statement to the site: “Upon inspection we see that Walmart has listed the item incorrectly, making it highly offensive; but rest assured, the product is not listed this way on our direct site, or any other channel we use. We have put in a ticket with the Walmart Catalog team to have the item name and description of the listing modified right away. We are not sure why Walmart has it titled the way they do.” Totally Costumes must feel confident, because they still have a ‘Slash Wound Prosthetic Appliance,’ currently with the description, “Give your costume a look so realistic that it seems scary real.” The Mighty earlier reported the product was listed as ‘Slashed Wrists Prosthetic Appliance’ with the description, “Give your costume a look so realistic that it seems suicidal.” At least they are practicing what they preach, cleaning up the “highly offensive” and sticking to happier things, like “memorable special effects to your undead corpse, zombie or scary Halloween costume.”   Related stories Haunted Carwash in Arlington Offers Soapy Scares 6 Of The Worst Treats Given On Halloween By People Who Hate Fun Woman Carrying Human Skull On Stick Leads Police To Remains Filed in: Watercooler Topics: controversy, Halloween, mental health Suggest a correction × Suggest A Correction Your name Your email Report a typo or grammatical error Cancel Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest LinkedIn Email Download the CW33 News App!

This is the last phase of necessary documentation and Pro Prom believes the final permitting is imminent. Pro Prom will also be handling distribution, marketing and sales to Walmart Mexico (WALMEX). Toby McBride, High Performance Beverage CEO, stated, “We are very pleased to announce our next production run and the introduction of our latest lemon/lime flavor.” He also stated, “Our primary focus has now shifted to U.S. distribution and sales while also meeting certain criteria for sales to Walmart.

Walmart says it pays more than $100 million a year in credit card fees and wants to reduce Visa transaction costs.   (Ryan Remiorz / THE CANADIAN PRESS)   By Aleksandra SaganThe Canadian Press Mon., Oct. 24, 2016 The dispute between Walmart Canada and Visa over merchant fees escalated Monday as the retail giant stopped accepting the credit card at its 16 stores in Manitoba. Walmart first refused Visa credit cards at its three stores in Thunder Bay, Ont., in mid-July, arguing that the financial services firm charges high fees to merchants. Alex Roberton, a spokesman for Walmart, said the company pays more than $100 million a year in credit card fees and is focused on reducing Visa transaction costs. Roberton said the impact of its policy on customers in Thunder Bay has been minimal, adding that the stores have seen an increase in cash and debit payments. Walmart announced in June that it would expand its phase-out of Visa at all of its Canadian stores — more than 400 — though Roberton said it hasn’t determined which stores will be next. Article Continued Below Visa spokeswoman Carla Hindman said Walmart’s action to further limit Visa acceptance in Canada is disappointing. Visa has said it offered Walmart one of the lowest rates for any merchant in the country, but Walmart wanted fees that would have been lower than those charged to local grocery markets, pharmacies, convenience stores, charities and schools. Despite the dispute, both companies say they are committed to working out a solution. The Retail Council of Canada, which represents businesses including Walmart, has said the average merchant fee of 1.5 per cent charged by Visa and MasterCard is higher than rates charged in other countries. The council has called on the federal government to intervene and lower fees for all merchants. The Finance Department said it is assessing the merchant fees to determine whether the costs and benefits of credit card transactions are appropriate. The review will take into account factors including the impact of Visa and MasterCard’s recent voluntary fee reductions, the adoption of a code of conduct for the country’s credit and debit card industry and approaches in other jurisdictions, said the department.

Travis Hoium (TMFFlushDraw) Oct 24, 2016 at 12:15PM The decision to install solar panels can be driven by factors like a desire to use clean energy or an interest in becoming more self-sufficient when it comes to electricity. But when large companies choose to go solar, they're doing so based on the dollars and cents of the investment. You may not know if the Target or Walmart store you're shopping at has solar, but if it does, it's saving the company money. And today, U.S. corporations are installing solar energy rapidly as a way to save millions of dollars.  Some corporate solar installations provide both energy and shade for customers, like this one. Image source: SunPower. Corporate America loves solar The Solar Energy Industries Association recently released its Solar Means Business 2016 report, and it showed a big increase in the amount of solar energy on corporate rooftops. There's now over 1 GW of solar for corporate customers, enough to power 193,000 homes. Target led the way with 147.5 MW, with 70 MW installed so far in 2016, while Walmart is using 145.0 MW. Apple's 93.9 MW and Costco's 50.7 MW means those companies are also among the top five installers.  Seven out of ten among the top ten corporate customers have installed SunPower (NASDAQ:SPWR) solar panels, reflecting the company's corporate focus. SolarCity (NASDAQ:SCTY), meanwhile, has Walmart as a major customer.  One incredible stat from the report is that more than three quarters of the commercial solar installations and half of the capacity are at data centers. Large data centers are often buildings with flat roofs, perfect for solar energy, and they're energy hogs. So offsetting some, or all, of the energy consumption with solar on a roof or a nearby field is an attractive option.  Image source: SolarCity. How big is commercial solar today?  In the first three quarters of 2016 there was 142 MW of solar installed at corporate sites. Compared to a total of 13.9 GW expected to be installed in 2016, this is a fairly small market. But it's becoming increasingly important.  Utility-scale solar, which will be around 7.8 GW this year, is the largest segment of the solar market in general. But it's highly volatile, and 2017 will see only a small number of new projects signed and built. Commercial solar is improving in viability, and will likely be a growth market in the future.  One reason that corporate solar customers haven't traditionally been a big customer base is that it's hard to finance their installation. It may sound crazy, but it's easier to finance a residential solar project that's backed by a customer with a reliable FICO score than it is a corporate customer with anything but a stellar credit rating. Companies come and go, leaving creditors in their wake, and solar companies -- and their financers -- don't want to take the loss for companies that go out of business. Today, solar is cheap enough that companies can put systems on their balance sheets, or even take out loans to finance projects. This means the financing barrier is breaking down, opening up the market.  Who is winning in commercial solar The two companies that have put a lot of attention on commercial solar are SunPower and SolarCity. Both have installation designs built to make commercial rooftop installations cost effective and efficient.  SunPower's pitch is based more around a higher efficiency product that's able to squeeze more energy out of each square foot. In small installations, a higher efficiency can lead to lower cost per watt -- that's a big reason the company is serving so many of these customers.  Travis Hoium owns shares of Apple and SunPower.

An attorney for the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union argued that the National Labor Relations Board, not the Benton County judge, should have jurisdiction over the matter. Wal-Mart had sought the order against the union and the Organization United for Respect at Wal-Mart in response to the group demonstrating and picketing at its stores over its pay and benefits. George Wiszynski, the attorney for the union, said the Bentonville-based company's trespassing complaint was nearly identical to one it had also filed with the national board. "At the end of the day, Wal-Mart relied on the same conduct for its unfair labor practice, its National Labor Relations Board charge as it does for its lawsuit," Wiszynski told justices. Wal-Mart's attorney, however, said trespassing is a state issue and was properly before the judge. "Trespass, repeated, defiant trespass absolutely is a significant state interest," Steven Wheeless told justices. "Second, there is no risk of interference between a state court hearing a trespass claim and a labor board hearing about a labor violation that arose during the trespass." Wal-Mart sued the union over the demonstrations, which it said has included "flash mobs" where demonstrators have banged on pots and pans march and chant through its stores. Other activities have included rallies and picketing at its stores and offices, the company said. The retail giant has filed similar suits against the union in Florida and Texas in recent years. The union has also argued that the judge's order was too broad since it bars entering Wal-Mart's property for "non-shopping" activities, rather than barring the demonstrations and other conduct that prompted the retail giant's complaint. The justices did not indicate when they would rule in the case. ___ Follow Andrew DeMillo on Twitter at www.twitter.com/ademillo ___ This story has been corrected to show the union's attorney, not Wal-Mart, argued the National Labor Relations Board should have jurisdiction over the complaint.

FROM OUR SPONSORS: Roeland Park resident raising concerns about tax money collected in anticipation of Walmart departure. Roeland Park resident and former mayoral candidate Linda Mau scolded the city council Monday for allowing tax dollars tagged for filling a potential financial gap if Walmart left the city to be pushed into the general fund. Mau said that now that it is obvious Walmart is not leaving Roeland Park residents should get reimbursed. “Over these past seven years the council governing body has increased our mill levy and our sales tax under the guise that we are saving it for that rainy day when… Walmart moves out of the city,” Mau said. “That rainy day isn’t happening. I want my money back.” Mau said she was shocked and appalled when she learned the money had been put in the general fund where it could be used for any purpose.

By Natalie Simms nsimmshh@att.net The new ‘mega’ Kroger Marketplace store opened less than three weeks ago on Main Street in Cartersville. With clothes, shoes, toys, kitchen and bath departments, plus a wine/beer bar inside the store, Kroger is working to change the face of grocery shopping with convenience in mind. With 124,000 square feet, the store is significantly larger than Rome’s Kroger store with about 83,000 square feet. That bigger than the two Walmart Supercenters in Rome, each at 100,000 square feet. As you walk in the new store, the initial layout is very similar to Rome with a large produce section and floral department and Starbucks Coffee shop off to the right. The store then opens to a large Bistro featuring sandwiches, pizza, hot soup, chicken, barbecue and pan Asian options that can be ordered to enjoy in-store at the open seating area or to-go. The Wine & Beer bar area (Hometown photo) What we were most surprised to find was an in-store bar serving wine and beer. You can purchase a glass of wine or beer from a list of options to enjoy there at the bar or over in the seating area. There is a three-glass purchase limit. “Kroger actively seeks opportunities to provide our shoppers with convenient locations and amenities, an expanded beer and wine section was an obvious way to provide yet another great service to enhance our shoppers’ experience,” says Glynn Jenkins, Public Relations director with Kroger’s Atlanta Division. “Kroger works closely with local breweries and distributors to display local beer and wine. The beer and wine is served in a self-contained part of the store. Customers, who wish to do so, have the option to eat, relax and enjoy a glass of wine or beer with their meal – as they may do so in other establishments such as restaurants and delis.” The Bistro has a number of grab-and-go food options, plus a sushi station, garden salad bar and a cold and hot “chef-on-the-run” buffet. This slideshow requires JavaScript. Alongside the Bistro is a Deli and Bakery areas, both providing same services and food you would find in Rome. As you head around toward the back of the store, we were very impressed by the expansive offerings of the fresh meat and seafood counter. The available fresh options looked to be double the amount found at the Rome store. The actual grocery aisles have same selection of items as Rome store but layout is very different.  There is a large ‘Kitchen Place’ department that features everything from pots and pans to dishes and utensils. It looked to be very similar to the set-up in Rome but slightly bigger. Toward the middle of the store is the clothing and shoe department. It is not a huge area like you’d find at Walmart but we were impressed by the variety. They had clothing for all ages and tastes from T-shirts to workout apparel to jeans and dresses. They also had a section for necessities including socks, underwear and women’s undergarments. There weren’t a lot of shoes, just one short aisle. The main thing to watch is price. Most things looked to be a few dollars more than you would pay for the same item at more discounted retailer like Walmart but we’re sure some folks don’t mind paying a little more for the convenience. The new toy department. (Hometown photo) Around on the far side of the store is a small toy department that had a little bit of everything from Barbie to Lego to preschool toys and board games. Of course it doesn’t offer near the selection as Toys R Us or Walmart but it definitely would be great to pick up that last minute birthday gift. The store also featured a large office/school supply area with at least four short aisles of products. There also is a small bath department with towels, shower products and bath fixtures. Around on the front corner of the store is a large pharmacy and The Little Clinic area for minor illnesses. According to their website, “The Little Clinic provides high quality, affordable healthcare located in convenient retail settings. The Little Clinic diagnoses and treats minor illnesses for patients 12 months and up with care provided by board-certified nurse practitioners and/or physician assistants.” The other unique service offered by the new store is the ClickList. Basically you can order your groceries from the comfort of your home, via the computer or phone app, and select a pickup time at the store. “Kroger knows our customers are busy and short on time, and we are excited to offer ClickList to help make their lives easier and shopping more convenient. Kroger customers using ClickList have the technology to help them meet their shopping needs when, where and how they want,” says Jenkins. “Customers can shop for more than 40,000 items on ClickList across the entire store, including fresh produce, meat and seafood, dairy and frozen products, before selecting a location and time slot most convenient to them. Items are delivered to the customer at the pick-up location within minutes of arrival.” There is a $4.95 service fee for each order but Kroger is waiving the fee for each customer’s first three orders. “Visit www.Kroger.com/ClickList, build a cart, select a pick-up location and time, and then place the order. An associate will carefully choose the items and store them in proper temperature zones until the customer arrives for pick-up,” says Jenkins. “Kroger is continuing to evaluate more locations to launch this innovative and convenient shopping experience.” Bottom Line: The store is nice and has a lot to offer customers including several options not available in Rome. For me, it isn’t worth the drive just for groceries but if I am ever in the area, I would definitely shop again. And I will be keeping my fingers crossed that the ClickList option expands to Rome!

(Erica Johnson/CBC) About The Author Erica Johnson Investigative reporter Erica Johnson is an award-winning investigative journalist. She hosted CBC's consumer program Marketplace for 15 years, investigating everything from dirty hospitals to fraudulent financial advisors. As co-host of the CBC news segment Go Public, Erica continues to expose wrong-doing and hold corporations and governments to account.

Daniel Schoeler says on every shift at almost every store, he saw loads of what appeared to be perfectly good food dumped in the trash, even though Walmart says it only discards inedible food.   "It's heartbreaking when you go home at the end of the day, to see that much food get thrown out," Schoeler told Go Public. "They just toss it freely." For six years, Schoeler worked for a company contracted by Walmart to assemble bikes, patio furniture and other products in the back of Walmart stores. He left last spring. He reels off a grocery list of items he says he regularly saw tossed in the trash compactor: tubs of margarine, yogurt and sour cream, bags of apples and potatoes, watermelons, cottage cheese, cans of food with expiry dates that hadn't passed, cheese, butter and baked goods. Jenny Rustemeyer says she and Grant Baldwin were able to bring home about $20,000 worth of dumpster food in six months, 'and that is just the smallest portion of what we found in the dumpsters.' (Jenny Rustemeyer) CBC Marketplace has launched a national investigation and learned of large amounts of waste at other Walmart stores across the country. In the Toronto area, they repeatedly found outdoor garbage bins piled high with everything from produce to baked goods, frozen foods, meat and dairy products. The Marketplace full investigation airs Friday, Oct. 28. "It bothers me a tremendous amount," says Schoeler, who says he only felt he could speak out after he quit. "So many low-income people shop at Walmart. They're scraping to buy this stuff, yet Walmart is just throwing it out the back door." Walmart responds When Go Public contacted Walmart for comment, spokesperson Alex Roberton said he couldn't discuss specifics, but said the giant retailer is committed to reducing food waste.   "There's an assumption that retailers don't care," said Roberton. "But retailers do care. It costs a lot of money to deal with waste, so it's not in a retailer's interest to just throw stuff out." Roberton said Walmart has teamed up with many organizations such as food banks to donate unsold food, and food is only discarded when it's deemed unsafe to eat. He could not address reports from Walmart insiders who told CBC they were instructed to throw away food if it looked imperfect or was close to an expired best-before date, or if shelf space was needed. Walmart food waste2:03 A professor of food studies at the University of British Columbia says most retailers throw out food because it's cheaper than finding it a new home. "It's much easier, much more cost-efficient to not pay your workers to separate food — to change their habits of disposing — to a system that is more responsible," says Will Valley, who teaches about food systems and sustainability. "It's the cost of business these days in retail environments," he says. When consumers expect a variety of convenient, cheap food, there will be waste. Saw no recycling Schoeler was bothered by more than food waste. He says none of the food was separated from its packaging before getting tossed in the trash compactor. "Everything that gets thrown out, gets thrown out in its package," he says — aside from milk, which was poured out before the containers got tossed. "There was zero recycling, except for cardboard boxes, where they can make money," says Schoeler. 'A store this big, and Walmart can't pay to have someone sort stuff? It's sickening.' — Daniel Schoeler "A store this big, and Walmart can't pay to have someone sort stuff? It's sickening," he says, shaking his head in disbelief. Schoeler was so disturbed by the lack of recycling he saw at the Guildford Centre Walmart in Surrey, B.C., that he emailed the municipality's waste management department. "I asked them, 'How come Walmart does not have to sort their garbage?'  I did not get a reply." Walmart's Roberton says all stores have recycling programs "for a range of waste products including cardboard, plastic, film, metal, electronics and food." He could not explain why Schoeler didn't see recycling bins in the stores in which he worked.  "If stores aren't doing that, that's obviously something we'll address," said Roberton. 'It's much easier, much more cost-efficient to not pay your workers to separate food,' says Will Valley, a University of British Columbia professor of food studies. (Tristan Le Rudulier/CBC) Corporations like Walmart have to follow the same recycling regulations as residences in Vancouver. Food waste must be separated from packaging. But waste regulators allow loads of garbage to have 25 per cent of food waste — including its packaging — mixed in with other trash.   A committee of local politicians in Metro Vancouver has recommended that be reduced to five per cent as of Jan. 1, 2017. Even though Walmart is operating within waste bylaws, longtime recycling advocate Helen Spiegelman says the corporate giant should do more. "It's disappointing," says Spiegelman, former executive director of the Recycling Council of British Columbia. 'Walmart damn well should have the wherewithal to fix these problems.' — Helen Spiegelman, recycling advocate "Walmart damn well should have the wherewithal to fix these problems. … It's a huge amount of laziness." Spiegelman says what's needed is a culture shift, where food waste and a lack of recycling become "sinful." "People think garbage doesn't matter," she says. "But it's contributing to climate change." Food waste is a large part of landfills, which emit methane, the second largest contributor to climate change, following carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels. Food waste a 'hidden secret' Jenny Rustemeyer doesn't believe most food thrown out by major retailers is unsafe to eat. The Vancouver filmmaker co-produced Just Eat It, a documentary on food waste that featured Rustemeyer and her partner Grant Baldwin living for six months on food from store dumpsters. "We took photos of everything that we found … from dairy to meat, fish, pasta and rice, even maple syrup," she says. Jenny Rustemeyer and her partner survived for six months on food pulled from dumpsters. The Vancouver filmmaker co-produced Just Eat It, a documentary on food waste. (CBC) "We were able to bring home about $20,000 worth of food in six months and that is just the smallest portion of what we found in the dumpsters."   "Not everything we found was edible, but everything we took home was … perfectly fine to eat." "I think it's a hidden secret," says Rustemeyer. "Everybody seems to be doing it, but nobody is actually measuring it. Nobody wants to talk about it." Rustemeyer says it's disappointing that stores can quietly throw away food, when a recent report by consulting firm Value Chain Management International estimates Canada wastes $31 billion in food every year.  "I would like to think companies would [donate unsold food] because it's the right thing to do, because it's an economically good thing to do, and because it supports the rest of society," she says. But since that's not what she documented, Rustemeyer would like to see stronger enforcement to reduce waste. "I think we need legislation that mandates donation of quality food." She points to the Food Donor Encouragement Act, adopted by B.C. in 1997, which protects organizations from any problems caused by donated food. "There's no fear of liability," says Rustemeyer.   "And I think we need an uprising from consumers to demand better behaviour from retailers."

But, a strong U.S. dollar hurt international operations. Shartia Brantley reports. ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript Increased store traffic helped Wal-Mart post better than expected earnings. The world's largest retailer posted its fifth straight gain in U.S. same-store sales, which rose by 1.5 percent. The company reported earnings per share of $0.99. Analysts polled by Reuters were expecting $0.98. But headwinds remain for its roughly 4,600 stores. It's consolidated revenue declined as international operations have been hurt by a strong U.S. dollar. And Wal-Mart said that it expects growth to slow to one percent at stores open more than a year during the current holiday quarter amid a competitive environment. Wal-Mart's earnings have been under pressure from costs associated with e-commerce, store remodeling and increased employee wages. The company says these investments have generated more sales and better customer service. Shares were up in early trading.

Several shoppers noticed the 'razor blade suicide scar wound latex costume make up' kit online for $3.99 and reached out to the retailer on social media. An online petition was started, but was discontinued after the retailer pulled the item from its website. Walmart pulled the costume from its website and issued a statement, 'This costume is appalling and it was unacceptable for a third-party seller to list it on our marketplace. It clearly violated our prohibited items policy and we removed it when it was brought to our attention.'

The mixed-use centre comprises a new Walmart Supercentre, a Home Depot and a number of national retailers such as Dollarama, L'Equipeur (a Canadian Tire banner), and TD Canada Trust, along with a number of food and service offerings. The 382,000 square foot mixed-use centre is 99% leased and incorporates a fully leased 62,000 square foot six-storey office building. "The high quality tenant base and the centre's dominance in its urban market fits very well with SmartREIT's existing retail portfolio," noted Huw Thomas, CEO of SmartREIT. "The total purchase price of approximately $62 million will be funded by existing cash and the assumption of an existing first mortgage providing solid FFO accretion to the REIT," Thomas added. The City of Pointe Claire, located on Montreal's West Island, has a thriving population base with strong demographics and household income. "We have the potential to add additional density to this centre which fits perfectly with our strategy to intensify our portfolio with additional retail as well as residential, seniors' housing, and even storage in selected locations, expanding each centre's offering to meet the needs of its community. By leveraging the capabilities of our extensive development platform, we are now working on adding value to a number of our existing retail sites as well as developing major urban mixed-use projects such as the Vaughan Metropolitan Centre," further added Thomas. About SmartREIT SmartREIT is one of Canada's largest real estate investment trusts with total assets in excess of $8.6 billion. It owns and manages in excess of 31 million square feet in value-oriented, principally Walmart-anchored retail centres, having the strongest national and regional retailers as well as strong neighbourhood merchants. In addition, SmartREIT is a joint-venture partner in the Toronto and Montreal Premium Outlets with Simon Property Group. SmartREIT's core vision is to provide a value-oriented shopping experience in all forms to Canadian consumers and to create high quality mixed use developments in urban settings. With SmartREIT's 2015 acquisition of SmartCentres, SmartREIT has transformed into a fully integrated real estate provider. SmartREIT and SmartCentres have had a long and successful alliance, helping to provide Canadians with value-focused retail shopping centres across the country. Now, the alliance has grown even stronger, the result is a fully integrated real estate provider with expertise in planning, development, leasing, operations and construction - all under one roof.

On Oct. 10, a man called Jefferson County Sheriff’s deputies after a customer at Walmart, 13420 W. Coal Mine Ave., threw printer cartridges at him and another employee. The suspect reportedly was angry that he could not return the cartridges because he didn’t have a receipt and the package was opened. The suspect apologized and the employee agreed to drop the charges if the suspect never returned to the store. Mail theft reported. A deputy responded to a report of mail theft Oct. 11 in the 10000 block of S. Wandcrest Drive, Pine.

The mixed-use centre comprises a new Walmart Supercentre, a Home Depot and a number of national retailers such as Dollarama, L'Equipeur (a Canadian Tire banner), and TD Canada Trust, along with a number of food and service offerings. The 382,000 square foot mixed-use centre is 99% leased and incorporates a fully leased 62,000 square foot six-storey office building. "The high quality tenant base and the centre's dominance in its urban market fits very well with SmartREIT's existing retail portfolio," noted Huw Thomas, CEO of SmartREIT. "The total purchase price of approximately $62 million will be funded by existing cash and the assumption of an existing first mortgage providing solid FFO accretion to the REIT," Thomas added. The City of Pointe Claire, located on Montreal's West Island, has a thriving population base with strong demographics and household income. "We have the potential to add additional density to this centre which fits perfectly with our strategy to intensify our portfolio with additional retail as well as residential, seniors' housing, and even storage in selected locations, expanding each centre's offering to meet the needs of its community. By leveraging the capabilities of our extensive development platform, we are now working on adding value to a number of our existing retail sites as well as developing major urban mixed-use projects such as the Vaughan Metropolitan Centre," further added Thomas. About SmartREIT SmartREIT is one of Canada's largest real estate investment trusts with total assets in excess of $8.6 billion. It owns and manages in excess of 31 million square feet in value-oriented, principally Walmart-anchored retail centres, having the strongest national and regional retailers as well as strong neighbourhood merchants. In addition, SmartREIT is a joint-venture partner in the Toronto and Montreal Premium Outlets with Simon Property Group. SmartREIT's core vision is to provide a value-oriented shopping experience in all forms to Canadian consumers and to create high quality mixed use developments in urban settings. With SmartREIT's 2015 acquisition of SmartCentres, SmartREIT has transformed into a fully integrated real estate provider. SmartREIT and SmartCentres have had a long and successful alliance, helping to provide Canadians with value-focused retail shopping centres across the country.

Pharmacy Locations, through County Law Enforcement - - Focus on Safe Drug Disposal Helps Combat Opioid Abuse, Misuse and Diversion - News provided by Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals Oct 25, 2016, 16:55 ET Share this article CHESTERFIELD, England, Oct. 25, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals (NYSE: MNK), a leading global specialty pharmaceutical company, today announced it will provide more than 60,000 drug deactivation pouches to families in West Virginia to encourage the safe and responsible disposal of leftover prescription pain medications. Mallinckrodt purchased and donated 55,000 pouches as part of a statewide initiative announced today by U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV). Each of the state's 55 counties will receive 1,000 pouches for their residents. Sen. Manchin's office will work with each county sheriff's office and local law enforcement, drug prevention coalitions and senior centers to distribute the pouches free of charge. Mallinckrodt also is making the pouches available at Walmart store pharmacy locations across the state. The user-friendly pouch-based systems deactivate prescription drugs and render chemical compounds safe for landfills. After placing unused medications in the specially formulated pouch and adding regular tap water, the pouch can be sealed and thrown away with the household trash. The pouches are completely biodegradable, providing an environmentally responsible way to deactivate and dispose of drugs. These donations are part of Mallinckrodt's 1-million pouch donation initiative to help combat the abuse of prescription pain medications, which is one of the top public health threats in the U.S. today. "As a company focused on the health and well-being of our patients and communities, Mallinckrodt has long been a strong advocate of addressing the complex issues of opioid misuse and abuse that cause so much harm to families," said Mark Trudeau, Mallinckrodt President and Chief Executive Officer. "We share the concerns of parents across the nation, and believe that providing patients with a safe, environmentally responsible way to dispose of unused medications is critical in this fight against prescription drug abuse," added Trudeau. "Mallinckrodt is committed to working with policy makers, community leaders, law enforcement and industry partners to ensure the responsible use of pain medication and prevent unused medications from ending up in the wrong hands." The initiative reinforces Mallinckrodt's long-standing commitment to the safe and responsible use of medications and collaboration with community leaders and organizations who share its goal of building public awareness of the critical role of responsible drug disposal in the fight against prescription drug abuse. A national survey of U.S. adults who used opioids showed that nearly 6 out of 10 had or expect to have leftover opioids, according to findings published online June 13, 2016, in the JAMA Internal Medicine journal. Nearly 68 percent of those who used prescription pain relievers non-medically in 2012-2013 got them from friends or relatives, according to the 2013 Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) National Survey on Drug Use and Health.

REUTERS/Edgard Garrido MEXICO CITY Mexico's Wal-Mart de Mexico (WALMEX.MX), the country's biggest retailer, posted a 69.7 percent rise in third-quarter net profit on Tuesday, helped by stronger sales and its divestment of a clothing chain. The company reported net profit of 10.050 billion pesos ($519 million) in the July-September period, up from 5.921 billion pesos in the same period a year prior. Third-quarter revenue at Walmex was 126.863 billion pesos, 10.8 percent higher than the year-earlier period. Quarterly net profit was above expectations of 6.517 billion pesos predicted in a Reuters poll of seven analysts. During the quarter, the retailer reached an agreement to sell its Suburbia clothing chain to El Puerto De Liverpool (LIVEPOLC1.MX) for about $852 million.

October 25, 2016 Recycling Today Staff Subscribe Municipal / IC&I The How2Recycle Label has jumped in membership numbers, which it credits to the support of retailer Wal-Mart, which has encouraged its private label suppliers to use labeling that helps consumers understand how to recycle products. By joining How2Recycle, suppliers can use the program's on-package recycling label to communicate to consumers how to recycle various types of packaging. Jack Pestello, senior vice president, private brands, Wal-Mart U.S., says, "We believe a best practice is to use labeling that helps customers recycle, such as the How2Recycle label, to communicate the recyclability of a package. The How2Recycle label is also a great conversational tool between merchants and suppliers to discuss if a package is designed with recyclability in mind." The How2Recycle Label now has more than 55 members. Consumers should expect to see the label on select Great Value and Equate products at Wal-Mart in the coming months. "We cannot understate the importance of the support of retailers like Wal-Mart in the How2Recycle program, who are leveraging their influence in the supply chain to make a true difference to support the accuracy of recycling claims," says Kelly Cramer, senior manager at Sustainable Packaging Coalition, the organization behind the How2Recycle Label program. "We very much look forward to welcoming more suppliers to How2Recycle in the near future." The Sustainable Packaging Coalition is a project of GreenBlue, based in Charlottesville, Virginia.  Education Related Effort to standardize Rhode Island’s recycling bins expands Himes to host free technician training class Orange County, Florida, launches recycling education campaign Most Shared Recon Services to install Zenrobotics system in its C&D facility Seattle composting facility accepts compostable coffee pods Tomra launches loyalty program in Michigan supermarkets Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

Launched in April, the new beverages are lightly flavored and, unlike other Sparkling Ice products, contain no sweeteners, artificial colors or preservatives. The essence line is currently distributed regionally at major grocery and mass channel retailers, including Walmart, Kroger, Stop and Shop, Publix and Target. In an email to BevNET, Talking Rain CEO Kevin Klock said that after six months on the market, the essence line is “off to a solid start” and performing “well enough” to launch nationally in 2017. As the essence line picks up new distribution, Talking Rain will focus on marketing initiatives intended to drive awareness of the products and how they are different from not only from competing carbonated water brands, but also other Sparkling Ice drinks, as well. Right now, the essence waters are packaged in the same 17 oz. slim plastic bottle used across the Sparking Ice portfolio, which includes iced teas and lemonades. However, the product lines look quite similar and merchandising them alongside each other might cause some customer confusion. It’s one of the reasons that Talking Rain is having “ongoing discussions” about new label and bottle options for the essence water line, according to Nina Morrison, Talking Rain’s vice president of community and customer relations. Brand-building aside, Klock said that an increasingly competitive pricing landscape for sparkling water, especially for multi-packs, represents the biggest challenge for the essence line. “Competition is $3.99 in a 15-pack of cans and private label is selling as low as $1.99 for a 12-pack,” Klock said. “It’s always been a commodity category.” Nevertheless, Talking Rain views an opportunity for Sparkling Ice essence to gain traction with sparkling water consumers because it comes in a resealable package. BevNET spoke with several Talking Rain executives at the NACS 2016 show, who pointed to the brand’s screw cap bottle as an advantage to can-packaged waters, particularly for single-serve sales. Sparkling Ice essence waters are also being positioned as complementary products to the brand’s flagship drinks, according to Talking Rain’s vice president of sales Chris Hall. It’s a strategy grounded in company research which found that current customers of Sparkling Ice’s primary line are also buying essence waters. As Talking Rain looks to 2017, the company is preparing for a “big splash” in messaging and new marketing campaign that cuts across the entire Sparkling Ice portfolio, one that comes with a $20 million budget for media buys. Newly installed CMO Brian Kuz said next year’s marketing efforts will be “a little bit louder” and supported by a new advertising agency, Seattle-based Wexley School for Girls. Kuz, the former Global Head of Trade Marketing and Insights at Red Bull, sees an opportunity for Sparkling Ice to one day become synonymous with sparkling water beverages, one that begins with developing a strong consumer connection to the brand. “A true, trusted, loved brand proposition — you will see it next year with the new campaign,” Kuz said.

Within an hour of arriving on scene officers were informed that two males had used Lueckings credit card and identification to charge purchases at the Clinton Walmart. Walmart employees became suspicious after one of the males appeared to be looking at the identification in order to sign for the charge.  When confronted, the two males fled the store leaving behind the bank card and identification belonging Luecking.  Store employees obtained the license plate number of their vehicle and provided it to police along with security video. Officers traced the plate to 3652 Walker Ramp Road in Rockville, and that is where detectives found the suspects loading bags containing personal items into Luecking's car. Police arrested 24 year old John Collins of Terre Haute on a preliminary charge of murder. Police later arrested 28 year old Benjamin J. Selig of Rockville on a preliminary charge of Assisting a Criminal. Officers have also arrested 25 year old Kathleen E. Featherstone of Terre Haute on Felony Murder, Robbery, and Burglary charges. She has been arrested before in connection to an allgeded attack on a woman in 2014 in Linton. For previous coverage of that story click here.

Walmart Pulls “Suicide Scar” Halloween Costume Makeup Kit Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Walmart Pulls “Suicide Scar” Halloween Costume Makeup Kit Image courtesy of @Migdalia_Rivera October 25, 2016 10:26 am EST By Ashlee Kieler@akieler Too Real walmart halloween costumes inappropriate makeup kit removing the product third-party seller Already this fall, several retailers have pulled Halloween decorations and costumes from their shelves and online stores because they were too dangerous, too creepy, or could be used to further a rash of suspicious incidents involving people dressed as clowns. Now, Walmart is joining those ranks: the retailer is removing what it calls an inappropriate “suicide scar” costume makeup kit.  WABC in New York reports that Walmart pulled the “Razor Blade Suicide Scar Wound Latex Costume Makeup” kit from its website after it drew the ire of health advocates and customers who called the costume insensitive to mental illness and glorifying self-harm. The retailer says that the product, which was sold for $3.99 online, was offered by a third-party company and was not actually from the retailer. “This costume is appalling and it was unacceptable for a third-party seller to list it on our marketplace. It clearly violated our prohibited items policy and we removed it when it was brought to our attention,” the company said in a statement. Before Walmart pulled the kit, customers shared their outrage over the inappropriate costume on social media and through a petition on Change.org. “Strong enough words do not exist to describe how horribly wrong this is,” one person posted on the petition, which has since been taken down. “I am a psychiatric nurse practitioner and know how damaging exposure to this could be. This shows an absolute lack of sensitivity and empathy for people affected by mental illness. I am absolutely appalled,” another petition signer said. Hi Walmart, I would like to know which part of this is a suitable costume for anyone. Self harm isn't a "scary costume" for all to wear🙂 pic.twitter.com/BLRpSXGY0J — t i f f (@tiffxxc) October 24, 2016 Shame on you Walmart for promotion a costume that endorses suicide: https://t.co/9NZOrW15Ta Suicide is devastating! #MentalIllness pic.twitter.com/8cPsbl35SQ — Migdalia Rivera (@Migdalia_Rivera) October 22, 2016 Hey @Walmart what's the deal?

(CBC) Related Stories Walmart insider says 'heartbreaking' amount of food dumped in trash How Canada sucks at reducing food waste Walmart vows change amid concerns over food waste How you can cut waste, save money and eat well CBC Marketplace Coming soon to a grocery store near you: ugly food, to save you money Got Mason jars? More grocery stores encourage 'bring you own container' initiatives 'Justice for blemished fruit': How some B.C. companies are fighting global food waste 'Astronomical' amount of food could be going to food banks, says farmer Doughnuts and pastries. Stalks of still-crunchy celery. Bags of bright, plump oranges. It sounds like a shopping list, but it was all in Walmart's garbage. CBC's Marketplace went through trash bins at two Walmart stores near Toronto to see how much food the company throws away. Walmart insider says 'heartbreaking' amount of food dumped in trash Over the course of more than 12 visits to the stores, Marketplace staff repeatedly found produce, baked goods, frozen foods, meat and dairy products. Most of the food was still in its packaging, rather than separated for composting. Also in the garbage: bottles of water, frozen cherries that were still cold and tubs of margarine. Watch the Marketplace investigation on food waste online In a statement, Walmart said it believes the food Marketplace found was unsafe for consumption. In many cases, however, the food was well before its best-before date and appeared to be fresh. Or, if it needed refrigeration or freezing, the food found was still cold. What's in Walmart's garbage1:04 Marketplace staff looked for food waste at all the major retailers, including Costco, Metro, Sobeys, Loblaws and Walmart. While staffers found bins full of food at some Walmart locations, other chains had compactors making it impossible to see what they throw out. Marketplace found cartons of milk days ahead of their best-before date, and Parmesan cheese with months left before it needed to be thrown away. On one trip, Marketplace staff found 12 waist-high bins full of food. After Walmart was contacted, it locked up the bins behind the stores where the food was found. These bags of oranges were found in a Walmart Canada garbage bin on one of 12 trips to a Toronto-area store. (CBC) Ali-Zain Mevawala says he threw out a shopping cart full of produce every day when he managed a Walmart produce and bakery department. Mevawala, formerly with one of the company's Edmonton stores, says if a piece of fruit or vegetable didn't look perfect, it had to be thrown in the trash. "I really felt bad because I know a lot of people in the city or in this country, even in this whole world, they don't even get to eat proper food." 'What's wrong with all those bags of oranges?' Food waste is a worldwide issue. In Canada, a study from Value Chain Management International says across sectors, including at the farm, during processing, in retail stores, restaurants and in homes, $31 billion worth of food is wasted each year. Retailers are responsible for about 10 per cent of that waste, according to the 2014 study. Ali-Zain Mevawala says he threw out a shopping cart full of produce every day when working as a produce and bakery department manager at a Walmart store in Edmonton. (CBC) One of the report's authors says retailers are just doing what buyers expect. "Much of that waste is usually us not willing to buy products that have a blemish in them," says Martin Gooch, CEO of Value Chain Management International. There are challenges in donating food, including location. It's easier to redistribute food in Toronto than in smaller communities, he says. He adds that retailers are working to address in-store processes and training so waste is reduced. Despite laws preventing companies that donate food from being prosecuted if someone gets sick, a key challenge is public opinion, should something happen, says Gooch. CBC Marketplace went through trash bins at two Walmart stores near Toronto to see how much food the company throws away. (CBC) "Someone who'd gotten sick from a product that was donated, that would create a whole bunch of attention … which a retailer or manufacturer has no way of combating." After viewing Marketplace footage, Gooch says the amount of food waste discovered demonstrated there is "room for improvement." "What's wrong with all those bags of oranges?" he said. Gooch did say some of the items Marketplace uncovered, such as bagged salad, could be unsafe if they had passed their "use by" date. Walmart responds Walmart declined an on-camera interview with Marketplace, but the company sent a statement that said it has many initiatives to decrease food waste throughout the company, including giving unsold food to food banks. After Marketplace contacted Walmart, the company locked up the bins behind the stores where the food was found. (CBC) "On some occasions, food which has not passed its best-before date is deemed unsafe for consumption," Walmart said in its statement. "As a rule we don't place fresh food items on display for sale if the quality is not acceptable." Some of the products may have been returns, the company said. Mevawala says he was given a different reason for the waste when he worked at Walmart. "Once I asked my manager, 'Why do we have to just throw it away? Why can't we just, you know, give it away to some people that really need it?'" he says. "And the manager [said], 'If you just give it away to people, then why are they going to buy it from us?'" Walmart Canada says Mevawala's claim doesn't reflect its approach to food waste.

She is especially disturbed because she says her uncle died from suicide by hanging.  She says years later a friend and co-worker died the same way.  She believes the product trivializes the pain of losing a friend to suicide. Boland said every time she sees the ad, “I see my late uncle. I see one of my best friends I worked with.” We invited Walmart to comment on Boland’s concerns, but have not received a response.  The product was available on line as of early Monday evening, however late Monday evening a link to the product was no longer working.  It’s not clear if that’s the result of a technical glitch or if the product is no longer available. 38.701439 -90.148720 Filed in: News Suggest a correction × Suggest A Correction Your name Your email Report a typo or grammatical error Cancel Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest LinkedIn Email Have a news tip?

A shopper noticed the "razor blade suicide scar wound latex costume make up" kit online for $3.99 and called out the retailer on social media: Hi Walmart, I would like to know which part of this is a suitable costume for anyone. Self harm isn't a "scary costume" for all to wear :-) pic.twitter.com/BLRpSXGY0J— t i f f (@tiffxxc) October 24, 2016 The post prompted a discussion about how mental illness is a serious matter: This is disgusting that Walmart would attempt to sell this; trying to push SUICIDE AS A COSTUME. Mental illness is no joke.— t i f f (@tiffxxc) October 24, 2016 Self harm scars aren't something fun to add to a costume. Self harm is the result of an abundance of self hatred and mental health issues.— t i f f (@tiffxxc) October 24, 2016 Customers also posted messages on Walmart's Facebook wall: "Your suicide scar makeup kit is disgusting and sends the wrong message - suicide is not something the play with or joke about, especially in conjunction with a holiday that is meant for kids and even teens," wrote Michelle Rafeeqah Fontaine. Walmart since pulled the costume from its website and issued this statement: "This costume is appalling and it was unacceptable for a third-party seller to list it on our marketplace. It clearly violated our prohibited items policy and we removed it when it was brought to our attention." Users quickly responded to Walmart's actions: "Thank you Walmart. As a psychiatrist myself, I was horrified, and there were many other physicians talking about this. Good to know this was not something you sanctioned. Hopefully your quality control around this type of stuff being offered by third party sellers on your marketplace will be tightened up further," wrote Su Jatha. An online petition was started over the weekend, but was stopped after the retailer pulled the item from its website. The third-party seller listed for the suicide scar was BlockBuster Costumes, LLC. Walmart.com continues to list other costumes from that company. Related Topics: shoppinghalloweencostumeswalmartu.s. & worldretail Email share share tweet email (Copyright ©2016 WABC-TV.

Travis Hoium (TMFFlushDraw) Oct 24, 2016 at 12:15PM The decision to install solar panels can be driven by factors like a desire to use clean energy or an interest in becoming more self-sufficient when it comes to electricity. But when large companies choose to go solar, they're doing so based on the dollars and cents of the investment. You may not know if the Target or Walmart store you're shopping at has solar, but if it does, it's saving the company money. And today, U.S. corporations are installing solar energy rapidly as a way to save millions of dollars.  Some corporate solar installations provide both energy and shade for customers, like this one. Image source: SunPower. Corporate America loves solar The Solar Energy Industries Association recently released its Solar Means Business 2016 report, and it showed a big increase in the amount of solar energy on corporate rooftops. There's now over 1 GW of solar for corporate customers, enough to power 193,000 homes. Target led the way with 147.5 MW, with 70 MW installed so far in 2016, while Walmart is using 145.0 MW. Apple's 93.9 MW and Costco's 50.7 MW means those companies are also among the top five installers.  Seven out of ten among the top ten corporate customers have installed SunPower (NASDAQ:SPWR) solar panels, reflecting the company's corporate focus. SolarCity (NASDAQ:SCTY), meanwhile, has Walmart as a major customer.  One incredible stat from the report is that more than three quarters of the commercial solar installations and half of the capacity are at data centers. Large data centers are often buildings with flat roofs, perfect for solar energy, and they're energy hogs. So offsetting some, or all, of the energy consumption with solar on a roof or a nearby field is an attractive option.  Image source: SolarCity. How big is commercial solar today?  In the first three quarters of 2016 there was 142 MW of solar installed at corporate sites. Compared to a total of 13.9 GW expected to be installed in 2016, this is a fairly small market. But it's becoming increasingly important.  Utility-scale solar, which will be around 7.8 GW this year, is the largest segment of the solar market in general. But it's highly volatile, and 2017 will see only a small number of new projects signed and built. Commercial solar is improving in viability, and will likely be a growth market in the future.  One reason that corporate solar customers haven't traditionally been a big customer base is that it's hard to finance their installation. It may sound crazy, but it's easier to finance a residential solar project that's backed by a customer with a reliable FICO score than it is a corporate customer with anything but a stellar credit rating. Companies come and go, leaving creditors in their wake, and solar companies -- and their financers -- don't want to take the loss for companies that go out of business. Today, solar is cheap enough that companies can put systems on their balance sheets, or even take out loans to finance projects. This means the financing barrier is breaking down, opening up the market.  Who is winning in commercial solar The two companies that have put a lot of attention on commercial solar are SunPower and SolarCity. Both have installation designs built to make commercial rooftop installations cost effective and efficient.  SunPower's pitch is based more around a higher efficiency product that's able to squeeze more energy out of each square foot. In small installations, a higher efficiency can lead to lower cost per watt -- that's a big reason the company is serving so many of these customers.  Travis Hoium owns shares of Apple and SunPower.

By TonyaGarcia Reporter In an effort to squeeze every dollar out of the holiday shopping season, sales associates and other retail workers cut short their Thanksgiving dinners in order to get the doors open for bargain hunters. However, there are very few retailers that gain from a Thanksgiving opening. “We doubt that the majority of specialty retailers benefit from involvement in this annual Thanksgiving opening arms race,” Moody’s Investors Service wrote in a note published Thursday. “Toys R Us and Best Buy Co. Inc. BBY, +4.12%  , which we consider specialty retailers, are likely the only ones that could make a case for being open before midnight on Thanksgiving night, and even that might be a push. Shoppers can only visit one store at a time and door-buster sales are typically heavily skewed toward toys and consumer electronics.” See also: More retailers, malls plan to stay closed on Thanksgiving Day The Mall of America, Office Depot Inc. ODP, +4.34%   and consumer electronics retailer Hhgregg Inc. HGG, +0.00%   are among the retailers that have announced they’ll be closed on Thanksgiving. Moody’s says Wal-Mart Stores Inc. WMT, -1.04%   has been a “catalyst” for Thanksgiving openings. The retail giant opened initially to help shoppers who needed groceries for their Thanksgiving dinners. “Other retailers have felt the pressure and have played follow the leader,” Moody’s wrote. “Department stores might be one of the few retailers that would benefit from opening on Thanksgiving evening,” noting that Macy’s Inc. M, +0.48%   recently announced it would be open for an hour more this year than last. See also: Macy’s adds electronics, including an Apple store, in time for the holiday season Whether retailers are open on Thanksgiving or not, the decision is framed as one made with shoppers in mind. A Macy’s spokesperson told MarketWatch recently that the decision to open earlier was “in response to significant, ongoing customer interest in shopping on Thanksgiving.” Hhgregg took consumers and staff into account, according to a release. “It’s important to us that our associates are able to be home with their families on Thanksgiving, and we are encouraging our customers to do the same -- knowing great deals will be available online, on Black Friday and through the weekend,” Hhgregg Chief Executive Bob Riesbeck said in the announcement about the close. Despite the statements, these decisions are made from a business standpoint. “It sounds altruistic but there’s a P&L discussion,” said Charlie O’Shea, lead retail analyst at Moody’s. “If you’re not going to open, what are you going to do? You redeploy your assets and dollars elsewhere.” See also: ‘The Amazon effect’ and 3 other things to watch for this holiday shopping season Whether physical locations are open or not, shoppers can log on to shop anytime online, which is where Moody’s recommends retailers focus. “We believe most retailers would be best served shifting dollars spent on Thanksgiving openings by pulling their web specials forward and picking off some additional sales earlier in the week, and offering heavier in-store promotions over the weekend,” the Moody’s note said. “We’ve seen too many instances of apparel retailers having to promote heavily the week after Thanksgiving, which is an indication that sales were slow over the weekend.” Over the years, consumers seem to have grown used to the Thanksgiving Day openings, even if they still have a distaste for the practice. More than half (55%) of Americans surveyed by RichRelevance, a tech company that services more than 200 retailers, said they are “annoyed” or “very annoyed” when stores stay open on Thanksgiving, down from 65% in 2014. To really gain goodwill, companies should follow specialty outdoor retailer REI, which announced Monday that all of its stores will be closed on both Thanksgiving and Black Friday, a repeat of last year’s #OptOutside initiative, which encouraged shoppers to go outdoors. This year, REI says it has been joined by hundreds of other organizations including The National Parks Service, Google GOOGL, -2.40%   and Subaru of America. More than seven in 10 Americans (73%) say they like retailers more for remaining closed, according to RichRelevance. And 48% said they’re more likely to shop at REI because of their decision to stay closed. “If I’m standing in line at Walmart to get the latest and great TV set, I’m not in someone else’s line,” said O’Shea. “No one puts themselves through that unless they’re buying.” Wal-Mart shares are up 12.3% for the year so far. Macy’s shares are up 4.8% for 2016 to date. And the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.01%   is up 5.3% for the same period.

Walmart vs. Visa: New battles will be drawn Monday in the dispute between the two corporate behemoths over merchant fees when Walmart stops accepting Visa credit cards at all of its 16 stores in Manitoba. The move comes after Walmart phased out Visa from its three outlets in Thunder Bay, Ont., in July, arguing that it pays too much in credit card fees.

A number of corporate heavyweights are reporting their latest results, including Barrick Gold, Husky and Restaurant Brands International.

This image was part of the exhibition "From Philadelphia to Monaco: Grace Kelly - Beyond the Icon" at the McCord Museum in 2013. Justin Tang / Montreal Gazette Share Adjust Comment Print Here’s our roundup of the best and brightest stories this morning. Get well soon: More affordable housing, less smoking, more home care for seniors, fewer sugary drinks. Those are a few of things Quebec thinks it’s going to take to have a healthier population, and it’s putting money where the province’s mouth is with an ambitious $76.1 million preventive health policy. There was a lot of applause for the program, but also some skepticism, with a patients’ rights advocate calling the whole thing a shell game. The government has cut 500 beds in long term facilities in the last 10 years, he said, “and I’m supposed to be happy with $76 million over the next 10 years? It’s ridiculous.” Credit check: The dispute between Walmart Canada and Visa over merchant fees heats up as the retail giant stops accepting the credit card in Manitoba. Walmart first refused Visa at its stores in Thunder Bay, arguing that the financial services firm charges high fees to merchants. The company claims it pays more than $100 million a year in credit card fees, and that customers in Thunder Bay didn’t mind at all. It promises to phase out Visa in all Canadian stores, which Visa calls “disappointing.” It’s a little like watching your two rich uncles bicker while you try to pay the Hydro bill, isn’t it? Speaking of riches: The Philadelphia home where Oscar-winning actress Grace Kelly grew up and accepted a marriage proposal from Prince Rainier III of Monaco in 1955 is now in the hands of the royal family. Her son, Prince Albert of Monaco, bought the six-bedroom, 2.5-story Colonial home, saying he was happy to have saved it “from a near certain death or development.” The property last made headlines in 2014 when its 81-year-old former owner pleaded no contest to animal cruelty charges for keeping cats and dogs in unsanitary conditions. Officials seized 15 cats and found the remains of several others. Yet Prince Albert said he has pleasant early memories of visits to the home, such as staring out an upstairs window or rolling around on the living room carpet. “The house is filled with little moments like that. Moments of being a family.” Grace Kelly’s family’s home in Philadelphia was purchased by Kelly’s son, Prince Albert, in October 2016.

Hispanic woman: Co-workers used Trump images to harass Ryan J. Foley, Associated Press 5:39 p.m. CDT October 25, 2016 Alexandra Avila of Columbus Junction is seen in this undated photo provided by attorney Paige Fiedler. Avila has filed a lawsuit that alleges her co-workers at the Coralville office of Sedgwick Claims Management Services repeatedly used the image of Donald Trump to harass her after she objected to Trump's comments about Mexican immigrants. (Photo: Associated Press) A Hispanic woman says her white co-workers at a Coralville claims office used images of Donald Trump to racially harass her for months after they learned she was angered by his description of Mexican immigrants as rapists, according to a civil rights lawsuit she filed against her company. Alexandra Avila’s co-workers at Sedgwick Claims Management Services — where they administered benefits for Wal-Mart employees — began calling her an “illegal immigrant” even though she’s a natural-born U.S. citizen, according to the lawsuit filed Monday. The suit claims her former co-workers placed a picture of an angry-looking Trump as Avila’s computer’s screensaver, signed her up to volunteer for his campaign and sent her racist memes, including one that read: “How’s Mr. Donald Trump going to deport all these illegals? Juan by Juan.” The Republican presidential candidate’s promise to build a border wall to keep out Mexican immigrants has for months contributed to racial tensions nationwide. “Build a wall” chants have been used by high school students to taunt Latino opponents at sporting events in multiple states, including Iowa, Wisconsin and Indiana. At Kent State University, Latinos marching in the Homecoming parade this month said they were taunted with the same chant. Avila, 32, worked at Sedgwick for three years. She claims she faced similar heckling at her white-collar workplace in Coralville from the beginning of Trump’s campaign in June 2015 until after she was fired five months later. “It’s been a weird political season where one candidate is taking public stances on things that, if the same words were said in the workplace, might constitute violations of our civil rights laws,” said Avila’s attorney, Paige Fiedler. “His candidacy has emboldened some people to feel like that doesn’t violate social norms anymore.” Lesley Gudehus, spokeswoman for Memphis, Tenn.-based Sedgwick, declined to comment on the lawsuit. Avila, born in California to Mexican parents, told colleagues she was upset with Trump’s 2015 campaign launch when he said of Mexican immigrants: “They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists.” Soon after, the lawsuit claims, colleagues removed the photo Avila had of her young daughter as her computer screensaver and replaced it with a picture of Trump yelling and pointing his finger. When Avila removed the photo, they kept switching it back to Trump, the suit alleges. An email arrived from the Trump campaign last fall thanking her for the support and asking how she wanted to help, according to the suit. Avila also claims her colleagues sent offensive memes, including one showing a brown-skinned man that read: “Found Jesus — he stabbed me twice.” When her department was voting on a potluck menu, one co-worker said Avila was ineligible because she was an “illegal immigrant,” drawing laughter from Avila’s boss, the lawsuit claims. Avila contends that after she complained about the harassment, the company accused her of falsifying time cards by claiming she worked minutes more time than she actually did. Avila was fired last November and escorted out, with Sedgwick saying it would send her personal property later. When her belongings arrived from FedEx, Avila says they contained a handwritten note that called her “La Trumpa” and added: “Illegal immigrants can’t vote or work. Good luck finding a job.” “Getting that box in the mail was a horrific experience,” Fiedler says. After her firing, a co-worker sent her an invitation to a Trump rally on Facebook, the lawsuit claims. The lawsuit, which names Sedgwick and two supervisors, alleges Avila suffered discrimination based on national origin and that the company failed to pay wages she earned. 567 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 14 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://dmreg.co/2eOyph6 TOP VIDEOS Watch: Anti-Trump marchers say they protest to support victims of hate 0:40 Centennial downs Valley at state 0:51 Iowa Election Day #instastory 4:40 Rural Iowa voters boosted Trump, Republicans in election 4:49 East High students stage walkout of Trump win 1:02 Iowan born before woman could vote hopes for history 1:07 How Clinton used Iowa as a stepping stone for campaign 0:38 How Trump wooed Iowa votes with nontraditional campaign stops 0:43 Justin Martin’s funeral procession travels through Rockwell City 0:23 Final Call for Des Moines police Sgt.

(Trevor Aikman/CBC) Related Stories Regina daycare centres fight property tax change City of Regina approves tax exemption for Highland, Tartan curling clubs Tax holiday for Frontenac apartments going before city council The Cathedral Area Co-operative Daycare and Normanview Daycare are appealing a decision which upheld their city tax increase in Regina. The Saskatchewan Municipal Board will hear the appeal on Tuesday. Five non-profit daycare centres operating in former houses had their tax class changed by the city from residential to commercial earlier this year. Regina daycare centres fight property tax change This resulted in taxes being doubled and, in one case, tripled. For example, the Cathedral Area Co-operative Daycare went from paying $3,500 to $8,000. "They (daycare centres) pay the same kind of taxes that any other business like Wal-Mart or Tim Hortons would pay. It's very difficult for these little daycares because they are small, non-profit daycares," said Colleen Schmidt board member for the Cathedral Area Co-operative Daycare. "This is a very, very devastating tax increase." Colleen Schmidt, board president of Cathedral Area Cooperative Daycare, said daycare spaces are in danger due to a property tax increase to $8,000. (Trevor Aikman (CBC)) First appeal denied In March, the centres appealed the increase at the Regina Board of Revision and were denied. The Cathedral and Normanview daycare centres are now appealing that decision in front of the Saskatchewan Municipal Board. Their argument is the city failed to treat all daycare centres the same during its assessment. For example, 20 daycare centres operating inside schools did not have their tax status reviewed. These daycare centres do not pay property tax because of their locations in the schools. The centres appealing the decision say that is against the Cities Act and the City of Regina should not be taxing some daycare centres and not others. "No daycare ever wants to think about the idea of cutting spaces but financially, if it's necessary, it might be something the daycare might at some point have to consider," said Schmidt. Schmidt said with Saskatchewan trailing other provinces in the amount of licensed spaces, making the timing of this increase even more problematic. "It's extremely important the daycare community stand up and express the difficulties they are having staying in business or we will lose spaces," said Schmidt. Curling rinks or daycare centres Tax exempt status is not part of the appeal but Schmidt said her group will be going to the city hoping to get in front of council to try and get daycare centres on the exempt list. The city provides tax exemptions to a number of different organizations and buildings. This year two Regina curling clubs received property tax relief for 2017 and 2018. Regina's Highland, Tartan curling clubs receive tax exemption "Curling is great it serves what purpose it does but daycare is in an entirely different league. It is essential. Without daycare people don't go to work," said Schmidt. Comment from the city The City of Regina provided a statement to CBC.  "We're aware of today's appeal, and await those results — we want to be sure everyone is treated fairly, paying their fair share and not more or less than that," the statement said.  "We're pleased that the provincial government is reviewing the legislation on this issue. When that review is complete, we'll know more about what options municipalities will have available." Decision expected in two months or less The Saskatchewan Municipal Board is hearing the appeal of the appeal to the Regina Board of Revision. If the municipal board disagrees with the initial decision, it has the power to make reverse the city's decision. A spokesperson for the board says a written decision is typically submitted in 60 days or less from the appeal hearing.

According to ABC7 News The “inappropriateness” of the kit went viral on social media with several posts: “Hi Walmart, I would like to know which part of this is a suitable costume for anyone. Self harm isn’t a ‘scary costume’ for all to wear.” “This is disgusting that Walmart would attempt to sell this; trying to push SUICIDE AS A COSTUME. Mental illness is no joke.” Self harm scars aren’t something fun to add to a costume. Self harm is the result of an abundance of self hatred and mental health issues.” In response, Walmart issued this statement: “This costume is appalling and it was unacceptable for a third-party seller to list it on our marketplace. It clearly violated our prohibited items policy and we removed it when it was brought to our attention.” The third-party seller listed for the suicide scar was BlockBuster Costumes, LLC. Walmart.com continues to list other costumes from that company.       Filed in: National/World News, News Suggest a correction × Suggest A Correction Your name Your email Report a typo or grammatical error Cancel Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest LinkedIn Email Print Your Favorite Live Music Venue Where do you go for good live music?

Avila has filed a lawsuit that alleges her co-workers at the Coralville, Iowa office of Sedgwick Claims Management Services repeatedly used the image of Donald Trump to harass her after she objected to Trump's comments about Mexican immigrants. (Alexandra Avila/Paige Fiedler via AP) IOWA CITY, Iowa (AP) — A Hispanic woman says her white co-workers at an Iowa claims office used images of Donald Trump to racially harass her for months after they learned she was angered by his description of Mexican immigrants as rapists, according to a civil rights lawsuit she filed against her company. Alexandra Avila’s co-workers at Sedgwick Claims Management Services — where they administered benefits for Wal-Mart employees — began calling her an “illegal immigrant” even though she’s a natural-born U.S. citizen, according to the lawsuit filed Monday in Iowa district court. The suit claims her former co-workers placed a picture of an angry-looking Trump as Avila’s computer’s screensaver, signed her up to volunteer for his campaign and sent her racist memes, including one that read: “How’s Mr. Donald Trump going to deport all these illegals? Juan by Juan.” The Republican presidential candidate’s promise to build a border wall to keep out Mexican immigrants has for months contributed to racial tensions nationwide. “Build a wall” chants have been used by high school students to taunt Latino opponents at sporting events in multiple states, including Iowa, Wisconsin and Indiana. At Kent State University, Latinos marching in the Homecoming parade this month said they were taunted with the same chant. Avila, a 32-year-old mother of one who worked at Sedgwick for three years, claims she faced similar heckling at her white-collar workplace in Coralville, Iowa, from the beginning of Trump’s campaign in June 2015 until after she was fired five months later. “It’s been a weird political season where one candidate is taking public stances on things that, if the same words were said in the workplace, might constitute violations of our civil rights laws,” said Avila’s attorney, Paige Fiedler. “His candidacy has emboldened some people to feel like that doesn’t violate social norms anymore.” Lesley Gudehus, spokeswoman for Memphis, Tennessee-based Sedgwick, declined comment on the lawsuit. Avila, born in California to Mexican parents, told colleagues she was upset with Trump’s 2015 campaign launch when he said of Mexican immigrants: “They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists.” Soon after, the lawsuit claims, colleagues removed the photo Avila had of her young daughter as her computer screensaver and replaced it with a picture of Trump yelling and pointing his finger.

We tend to think that some of the outrage gets a trifle overdone. Other people irked by some of the dress-up clothes mass manufactured for Oct. 31 have a point. Sometimes things that were once considered OK by the masses aren’t any longer. We imagine that many a child of yesteryear dressed up as an “Indian” for example — something that has since fallen clearly (and justifiably) under the heading of cultural insensitivity. Then there was the ill-considered “Tranny Granny” costume that’s been pulled this year already from Amazon and Wal Mart, for obvious reasons. Having seen pictures, we can’t imagine this would have been a great seller anyway, quite aside from its perpetuation of outdated gender stereotypes. And speaking of outdated gender stereotypes, past years have, also justifiably, seen parents of little girls upset by a couple of legitimate issues. These are, one, a lack of superhero costumes for girls, and two, a plethora of really inappropriately suggestive get-ups. On the first, why shouldn’t a girl get to be a superhero if she wants to? She shouldn’t have to be relegated to the sidekick role. There’s plenty of little girls who will want to be princesses for Halloween, but for those who want to be Spiderman, or Superman or Batman, it should at least be an option. On the second, who wants to send their seven-year-old out in fishnets, or a naughty maid costume? And yet, these are actually sold for young girls. It’s not cute, it’s just really uncomfortable. Let’s stick with age-appropriate. But by far the worst thing we’ve seen so far this month is the press release from Children of the Street Society, begging parents not to send their children out trick-or-treating as a pimp or a ho. It’s horrifying that there are enough parents encouraging or allowing this that such an organization felt the need to send out a media release. What parent thinks it would be fun to send their kid out dressed as someone in the sex trade? It’s not funny or clever or edgy. It’s just sad. And beyond bad taste.   We encourage an open exchange of ideas on this story's topic, but we ask you to follow our guidelines for respecting community standards.

Patterson said she was fired from her job there after attempting to stop a shoplifter from hurting a fellow employee. Patterson had worked at CVS in Redding for nearly 20 years. Posted: Oct. 24, 2016 43 Comments SHARE By David Benda of the Redding Record Searchlight Posted: Oct. 24, 2016 43 Vikki Patterson believed she was protecting a co-worker when she confronted an alleged shoplifter inside the CVS in west Redding earlier this month. The company feels otherwise. Patterson, a CVS employee for nearly 20 years, said she was fired for violating company policy. "I found out Friday but not through anybody from work. I found out when I tried to sign on to try and see my benefits online and noticed some stuff was missing," the 47-year-old Patterson said Monday. Patterson called human resources and was told she no longer had a job. A CVS spokesman said the safety of the store's customers and employees comes first during a shoplifting or robbery. "We do not comment on specific security policies because we do not want to undermine them. However, the actions of Ms. Patterson endangered everyone who was present during the incident at our Redding store, including customers, her co-worker and herself," Mike DeAngelis, CVS's senior director of corporate communication, wrote in a prepared statement emailed to the Record Searchlight. Patterson has received a ton of support on Facebook after posting her story Friday afternoon. As of Monday afternoon, the post had been shared 237 times, had 649 likes and 427 comments. What's more, a "CVS Pharmacy: Reinstate Vikki Patterson" campaign has been posted on Facebook along with other supportive posts. The incident occurred around 9:30 p.m. on Oct. 12. Patterson, a manager in training, said she was preparing to close when she noticed two women stuffing merchandise into a purse. She went over to ask the pair whether they needed help then called out, "security to the camera room," a tactic Patterson said is used to scare off shoplifters. The women indeed exited the store, leaving the merchandise. Patterson thought the crisis was averted. "One stayed outside cussing and yelling the whole time," Patterson recalled. But her partner came back inside and confronted Patterson about calling for security before going back to the aisle and filling her purse with what Patterson said was about $300 worth of merchandise. "My cashier told me she's loading her purse up," Patterson said. "So I go towards her and said, 'you need to leave that stuff there' and she starts running." The woman ran toward the door where the cashier was standing. "I'm trying to get to the door before she slams into my employee," Patterson said, "and that's when the struggle happened. I mean, the video is bad because I was trying to protect myself — she was hitting me." The scuffle spilled outside the store before the woman was able to drive off with her partner. Patterson and her co-worker called police, who finally caught up with the pair. Amber Walworth, 31, was arrested, according to police and remains in the Shasta County jail on $150,000 bail. She was also wanted on a previous charge of robbery out of Anderson, Shasta County Superior Court records show. Patterson believes she did not violate CVS' "shoplifter apprehension guidelines," which she says lists five things to do before confronting and apprehending a shoplifter. The policy also states "CVS/pharmacy has a 'hands off' policy relative to shoplifting apprehensions." "I looked up apprehend in the dictionary. How are you supposed to apprehend without touching her?" Patterson said. Redding police Sgt. Les James said law enforcement won't tell businesses how to deal with would-be shoplifters. They leave it up to the store. "Each company has its own policy regarding interacting with shoplifters," James said. Patterson has applied for unemployment benefits and is waiting to hear if she qualifies. She is a sole provider. Her husband, Robert, is on disability. "I don't know. I have had such a great outpouring from everybody concerned," Patterson said about her future plans. "I am not quite sure. I haven't been unemployed in 18 years. Things are different from when I was younger." About David Benda Business reporter David Benda has been a journalist for nearly 30 years, including stints as a sports editor and copy editor.

Avila has filed a lawsuit that alleges her co-workers at the Coralville, Iowa office of Sedgwick Claims Management Services repeatedly used the image of Donald Trump to harass her after she objected to Trump's comments about Mexican immigrants. (Alexandra Avila/Paige Fiedler via AP) Hispanic woman claims co-workers used Trump images to harass Last Modified: Tuesday, October 25, 2016 3:05 PM By Ryan J. Foley / Associated Press IOWA CITY, Iowa -- A Hispanic woman says her white co-workers at an Iowa claims office used images of Donald Trump to racially harass her for months after they learned she was angered by his description of Mexican immigrants as rapists, according to a civil rights lawsuit she filed against her company. Alexandra Avila's co-workers at Sedgwick Claims Management Services — where they administered benefits for Wal-Mart employees — began calling her an "illegal immigrant" even though she's a natural-born U.S. citizen, according to the lawsuit filed Monday in Iowa district court. The suit claims her former co-workers placed a picture of an angry-looking Trump as Avila's computer's screensaver, signed her up to volunteer for his campaign and sent her racist memes, including one that read: "How's Mr. Donald Trump going to deport all these illegals? Juan by Juan." The Republican presidential candidate's promise to build a border wall to keep out Mexican immigrants has for months contributed to racial tensions nationwide. "Build a wall" chants have been used by high school students to taunt Latino opponents at sporting events in multiple states, including Iowa, Wisconsin and Indiana. At Kent State University, Latinos marching in the Homecoming parade this month said they were taunted with the same chant. Avila, a 32-year-old mother of one who worked at Sedgwick for three years, claims she faced similar heckling at her white-collar workplace in Coralville, Iowa, from the beginning of Trump's campaign in June 2015 until after she was fired five months later. "It's been a weird political season where one candidate is taking public stances on things that, if the same words were said in the workplace, might constitute violations of our civil rights laws," said Avila's attorney, Paige Fiedler. "His candidacy has emboldened some people to feel like that doesn't violate social norms anymore." Lesley Gudehus, spokeswoman for Memphis, Tennessee-based Sedgwick, declined comment on the lawsuit. Avila, born in California to Mexican parents, told colleagues she was upset with Trump's 2015 campaign launch when he said of Mexican immigrants: "They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists." Soon after, the lawsuit claims, colleagues removed the photo Avila had of her young daughter as her computer screensaver and replaced it with a picture of Trump yelling and pointing his finger. When Avila removed the photo, they kept switching it back to Trump, the suit alleges. An email arrived from the Trump campaign last fall thanking her for the support and asking how she wanted to help, according to the suit. Avila also claims her colleagues sent offensive memes, including one showing a brown-skinned man that read: "Found Jesus — he stabbed me twice." When her department was voting on a potluck menu, one co-worker said Avila was ineligible because she was an "illegal immigrant," drawing laughter from Avila's boss, the lawsuit claims. Avila contends that after she complained about the harassment, the company accused her of falsifying timecards by claiming she worked minutes more time than she actually did. Avila was fired last November and escorted out, with Sedgwick saying it would send her personal property later. When her belongings arrived from FedEx, Avila says they contained a handwritten note that called her "La Trumpa" and added: "Illegal immigrants can't vote or work. Good luck finding a job." "Getting that box in the mail was a horrific experience," Fiedler says. After her firing, a co-worker sent her an invitation to a Trump rally on Facebook, the lawsuit claims. The lawsuit, which names Sedgwick and two supervisors, alleges Avila suffered discrimination based on national origin and that the company failed to pay wages she earned.

Photo by Paul Mobley By Mary Ann Bourbeau RED BANK – After a devastating highway accident that nearly took his life, comedian Tracy Morgan is back, and he never takes one day for granted. “It feels great to be alive,” he said. “I’m glad I’m still funny.” His current national tour is called “Picking Up the Pieces,” which is exactly what he has done since the June 2014 crash on the New Jersey Turnpike, when a Walmart truck crashed into the limo van he was riding in. The accident left Morgan with multiple broken bones and a traumatic brain injury, and took the life of his close friend, comic James McNair. “It’s called ‘Picking Up the Pieces’ because my life was shattered after the accident,” he said. “My family was really shattered too. But I’m not crying about it. The accident was only one piece of my life. I have a wife and kids and a life outside of show business.” Morgan will talk about his experiences and his life when he performs two shows at the Count Basie Theatre on Friday, Oct. 28 at 7 and 9:30 p.m. “God gave me the gift of a sense of humor,” he said. “I love to see people smiling and laughing. On stage, when I’m making people laugh, that’s when I feel close to Him. I hope when He welcomes me into his Kingdom, he says, ‘You did a good job, Tracy.’ ” Morgan’s recovery was a long road, but the Saturday Night Live alum, who later starred for seven seasons on the NBC show “30 Rock,” now has several projects in the works. He recently finished production on “Fist Fight,” in which he stars alongside Ice Cube and Charlie Day. He will also take on the role of comedian Redd Foxx in the Richard Pryor biopic “Richard Pryor: Is It Something I Said?” opposite Mike Epps. “I’m truly honored to be asked to be a part of it,” Morgan said. “I pray that Mr. Foxx will give me the strength to do him justice because he’s such an icon.” It was announced this week that Morgan will return to television with a still-untitled TBS comedy series in which he will star along with Key and Peele’s Jordan Peele. Morgan plays an ex-con, released after 15 years in prison, who is shocked to see how much the world changed while he was gone. He is also slated to receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame this year. “That’s what I always wanted, to have a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and I achieved it,” he said. “When I’m long dead, my great-great-grandchildren will see my name there. That means more to me than anything in show business.” While Morgan will likely discuss the accident and his long road to recovery during his stand-up routine, he declined to give any specifics about the material. “I’m not tipping my jokes,” he said. “Just come see me be funny.” Tickets are $29 to $49.

Asit Sharma (TMFfinosus) Oct 25, 2016 at 2:30PM Image source: Getty Images. In its third-quarter 2016 report issued on Oct. 20, electronic payments provider Euronet Worldwide, Inc. (NASDAQ:EEFT) posted revenue growth slightly below the pace set in the first two quarters of the year. Yet in comparison, the company achieved a considerably higher operating margin. Let's examine both the revenue moderation and the drivers behind Euronet's margin expansion, beginning with a review of key highlights from the company's filing: Euronet: The raw numbers Metric Q3 2016 Actual Q3 2015 Actual Growth (YOY) Revenue $524 million $481 million 8.9% Net income attributable to Euronet Worldwide $61 million $31 million 97% Diluted earnings per share $1.11 $0.57 95% Data source: Euronet Worldwide, Inc. 8K-filing, Oct. 20, 2016. YOY = year over year. What happened with Euronet this quarter? Euronet's EFT processing segment recorded brisk revenue growth of 28%, to $152.6 million. EFT processing benefited from a larger ATM network, which has expanded by more than 8,000 ATMs in Europe and India versus the end of Q3 2015. EFT processing will net further top-line gains in the coming quarters. Earlier this month, on Oct.10, Euronet completed the acquisition of U.K. ATM network operator YourCash Europe LTD. With this purchase, Euronet will add 5,000 ATMs across the U.K., Ireland, Belgium, and the Netherlands to its arsenal. Surprisingly, the YourCash ATMs generate less than half the operating margin of Euronet's existing European network. These ATMs will appear on Euronet's financials beginning in the fourth quarter, and management has signaled that it will move quickly to add value to the YourCash transaction stream. Following a trend in recent quarters, Euronet's epay segment experienced a marginal revenue decline of 4%, to $167.2 million. Revenue from epay may remain lackluster for a few quarters as management works to effect a shift from declining mobile airtime top-up services to more lucrative digital services, which include the sale of content and gaming products via retail locations. The company's third segment, money transfer, achieved revenue improvement of 9%, a considerable deceleration from the revenue growth seen in both Q1 2016 (25% increase over the prior year) and Q2 2016 (22% increase over the prior year). While Euronet's RIA subsidiary is still posting double-digit growth through its remittance partnership with Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), the segment's foreign exchange subsidiary, HiFx, was held to single-digit growth during the quarter, as forex trading volumes of the British pound have been subdued following the U.K.'s Brexit vote.  Also in money transfer, executives noted that currency subsidiary XE will migrate its processing from a competitor to HiFx's platform in November, which should improve operating margins in the segment. Overall, though Euronet's revenue improvement slowed relative to the first half of the year, operating income margin increased handsomely, by roughly 270 basis points, to 17.3%. This is partly attributable to an annual effect: In the third quarter, peak European tourism brings higher margin traffic and transactions to the company's continental ATM network, pushing EFT processing profits higher. In addition, management cited a focus within epay on transactions with more lucrative margins, if lower volume, during the third quarter, thus benefiting total operating income. What management had to say For those following Euronet from quarter to quarter, it's clear that epay remains the segment with the most long-term revenue uncertainty. During Euronet's post-earnings conference call, executives discussed in detail various initiatives to replace mobile airtime top-up transactions with newer services. The following is a description of the current efforts, provided by CEO Mike Brown: "Our epay team continues to focus on expanding its non-mobile content presence. As we told you last quarter, our gaming partners are focused on rolling out more gaming content across our retail partner base. During the quarter, we experienced a 65% year-over-year growth in gross profit in the gaming category and we have excellent momentum as we enter the fourth quarter where we will see seasonally stronger sales of the non-mobile products. We have also maintained our focus on expanding our digital content distribution. In the US we launched Apple music sales through PayPal and eBay. The new Apple music codes are sold as a subscription base gift cards similar to that of the Netflix digital codes that we launched last year. We also signed agreements to distribute digital gift codes for Blizzard, the publisher of games such as World of Warcraft and StarCraft across Europe. And we expanded our relationship with Netflix for digital code distribution across the US and more of Europe. In India, we signed an agreement with Google to digitally distribute Google Play codes, this is Google's first digital distribution agreement in India and we are pleased to add this to product portfolio." Data source: Seeking Alpha transcript, Oct. 21, 2016. Moving forward Euronet's fourth quarter will be characterized by operational execution. The company will both absorb its YourCash acquisition and complete the XE processing migration to HiFx. In this workhorse context, executives have targeted fourth-quarter adjusted earnings per share at $1.07, which would translate to a decent 16% leap over Q4 2015. While shareholders shouldn't expect a huge variation from this earnings target, it's conceivable that revenue could resume the faster growth trend seen in the front half of the year, boding well for the coming quarters as we head into 2017.   Asit Sharma has no position in any stocks mentioned.

The Wayne-based retailer announced its partnership with Mattel Inc., which owns the American Girl brand, at the end of August, but kept details under wraps until this week, when it rolled out American Girl boutiques in about 100 of its stores nationwide, including the Toys “R” Us in Deptford. Toys “R” Us’ current strategy for revitalizing its stores involves giving shoppers products and experiences they won’t find at other places that sell toys, in particular at the company’s top rivals, Walmart and Target. Toy industry analysts, when the American Girl deal was announced, said the premium brand could also give Toys “R” Us a “classier” image. Mattel is hoping its partnership with Toys “R” Us, as well as a distribution deal with Kohl’s stores nationwide, will boost American Girl sales, which have slipped in recent years. The store in Totowa, in Passaic County, opened its boutique Monday for a media preview. The remaining New Jersey stores — Deptford,  Paramus, Secaucus, Freehold and Eatontown — will hold grand opening events Saturday for the American Girl boutiques, featuring giveaways and the chance to win a doll. Some shoppers at the Totowa Toys “R” Us did a double-take upon seeing display of American Girl dolls, which previously were sold only online and in American Girl flagship stores. “American Girl! What are they doing in Toys “R” Us?” was the reaction of shopper Stella Quigley of Clifton, who has bought the dolls in the past for her 10-year-old granddaughter. “I was very surprised to see that,” said Quigley, who was at the Totowa store Monday. Quigley’s granddaughter has 10 American Girl dolls, and Quigley was looking to see if Toys “R” Us had the new Girl of the Year doll to add to the collection. Toys “R” Us won’t be selling the Girl of the Year dolls, but Quigley said she might visit the store again to look for accessories for her granddaughter’s dolls.

They are the Truly Me line, which are dolls that come in about 100 different combinations of hair color and style, and skin color, so a child can pick the doll that most resembles her; and the Wellie Wishers line, which are smaller, 14.5-inch dolls intended to appeal to younger girls, and are about half the price of the traditional 18-inch American Girl dolls. The Wellie Wishers dolls are priced at $59, while the Truly Me and other American Girl dolls cost about $120. Mayra Moncayo-Baez, a mommy blogger from North Bergen, brought her two daughters — Hailey, 7, and Alyssa, 5 — to the unveiling of the Totowa boutique, and the girls each picked out a Wellie Wishers doll to buy. Moncayo-Baez said she likes the smaller dolls because they are easier for girls to carry around. She also likes the lower price tag. “I love the American Girl brand, but it is kind of pricey,” she said. The American Girl brand also began selling Wellie Wishers dolls, and its 2016 “Doll of the Year” in 1,100 Kohl’s stores nationwide this year. American Girl dolls were a hot property for little girls growing up in the late 1990s and early 2000s, but the company has struggled in recent years to reach new generations of little girls. In 2015, Mattel reported that sales of the brand had declined by 7 percent from the previous year. The company said several of its girl brands had suffered from a lack of creativity and it has brought in a new management team to turn the brands around. It also attributed the sales decline to the introduction of the Truly Me line. The Wellie Wishers line was created in response to complaints by parents that a lower-priced option was needed, and that line is credited with boosting American Girl sales in the most recent quarter. The company reported last week that sales of the brand were up 14 percent for the third quarter to $125.5 million. A Toys “R” Us spokeswoman said that while Kohl’s also sells the Wellie Wishers and other American Girl dolls, Toys “R” Us will be the only retailer authorized to sell the Truly Me dolls and to have American Girl boutiques within its stores. The boutiques will have Toys “R” Us employees who have been trained to sell American Girl dolls and to answer questions about the brand. American Girl dolls were a favorite gift of doting grandmothers willing to spend $100 or more on a doll and clothes and furniture. The first dolls depicted girls growing up during various periods in American history, such as colonial times, or the Depression, and included themed accessories and story books about their lives. The brand was so popular at one point that Target sold a line of lower-priced knock-off doll furniture sized to fit the American Girl dolls. The American Girl brand was launched by a catalog and mail-order company called The Pleasant Company in 1986. Mattel acquired the brand in 1998. According to Mattel, close to 30 million American Girl dolls have been sold since 1986.

By Josh Kolm October 25, 2016 Metro is testing the online grocery shopping waters at three stores in Quebec before rolling out the service elsewhere. First announced early this year, the service will be available at two locations in Montreal and one in Laval. After a customer makes purchases online, employees dedicated to online shopping in the store will choose the freshest available version of the product. The purchases are kept in a dedicated, climate-controlled area of the store to ensure freshness until they are given to the customer, who can either pick them up in-store or have them delivered to their home. Described as “Phase I,” delivery will initially be available to customers in a selected area east of Highway 15 on the Island of Montreal. The results of Phase I will dictate how Metro deploys online shopping elsewhere in Quebec and in Ontario. The addition of online shopping is part of an ongoing digital strategy at Metro, which has included a revamped website and new apps on mobile devices and wearables. Some form of online grocery shopping has become an increasingly popular initiative for retailers. Loblaw’s and Walmart, as well as niche retailers like M&M Food Market, have “click-and-collect” options for fresh food at select locations. Sobey’s began rolling out a delivery option to complement its own pick-up service earlier this year, while Longo’s Grocery Gateway delivery service has operated since the late 1990s. Other retailers have partnered with third-party delivery services like Urbery or Instabuggy, while Amazon has been long rumoured to be planning a launch of its U.S. fresh food delivery service in Canada, and has been testing a pick-up option this year by partnering with local convenience stores. According to this year’s BrandSpark Canadian Shopper Survey, only 8% of Canadians have tried online shopping for groceries. While that may be due to the fact that most options are new or have limited availability, 25% said they would be “somewhat likely” to try an online shopping and delivery option from their regular store, 10% said they would be “very likely” and 9% said they definitely would. That’s compared to 56% of respondents whose responses ranged from “somewhat unlikely” to “definitely would not.” One of the main deterrents to online grocery shopping, according to the survey, was concerns about the quality and freshness of the food, with 45% of those surveyed saying they would buy most groceries online, but not fresh products. Among those who said they wouldn’t shop online for groceries, 72% said they wanted to see the food they buy, with 54% saying they are concerned about the quality of fresh food. “We have made every effort to ensure that customers make no compromise with respect to the freshness of the products selected, that they find all the products they are looking for online as they would in-store and that they receive their order at the most convenient moment for them,” said Marc Giroux, SVP at Metro, in a press release.

Baweja joined Flipkart in September 2014. A Flipkart spokesman said Dec. 31 would be Baweja's last day at the company and the search for a replacement had begun. Flipkart, launched in 2007 by two former Amazon employees, sells a wide range of products from mobile phones to suitcases and cosmetics.

From a federal funding crisis to the resignation of a chairman and a general manager to the reinstatement of Saturday bus service, there was a lot for local leaders to catch up on during City Council meeting this week. Glenn Steffens, who has served as site manager since July, summed up many of the changes at Saginaw Transit Authority Regional Services (STARS) during Monday's meeting. "As I'm sure you're all aware, STARS has had a lot of challenges in the last year," Steffens said. Saginaw bus system in jeopardy due to federal funding dispute He referred to flaws in a Federal Transportation Authority triennial review that resulted in $1.8 million in federal funding for the authority being temporarily withheld. "STARS was very close to being shut down," Steffens said. "Fortunately, many here in Saginaw rallied together." 'Putting the pieces back together' Federal funding to STARS was later restored, although both General Manager Sylvester Payne and Board Chairman Daniel LaPan resigned in the wake of the crisis. Through collaborative efforts by Saginaw officials, state lawmakers and federal officials, and with help from Flint's Mass Transportation Authority (MTA), the new site manager said STARS has been "putting the pieces back together." "But we still have a lot of challenges ahead," Steffens said. He thanked the Saginaw voters who, in August 2015, approved a millage renewal request to continue local funding support for the transit system. Steffens acknowledged how many must have felt when STARS approved dramatic cuts to bus service less than three months after that election. "I understand that there were some harsh feelings after much of our routes were cut, from 11 to 7, after the millage renewal," he said. "I'm here to also offer STARS' current commitment to not cutting services, but rather maintaining and looking at expanding services, and doing so responsibly, taking one step at a time." 'Saturdays are here to stay' One recent change aimed at improving the damaged relationship the authority has with the community was the restoration of Saturday bus service, which began alongside a 25-cent fare increase on Oct. 1. Saginaw bus system bringing back Saturday services, routes to Walmart The new $1.50 fares help support the restored Saturday bus service, which runs from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. each Saturday, and the on-demand LIFT ride services, offered from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Saturdays. Steffens assured city leaders that the decision to bring back Saturday service took into account the authority's financial realities and was a long-term decision. "Saturdays are here to stay," he said. Another small "thank you" from STARS to Saginaw citizens, Steffens said, is a commitment to provide free bus rides on Tuesday, Nov. 8, the day of the upcoming general election. "Election Day is free ride day here at STARS," he said. "Whether you need to go shopping or get out to vote, which I would highly encourage everyone to do so." Saginaw bus system offers all riders fare-free service on Election Day Buses will run later than usual — until 8 p.m. — and the authority has also committed to provide all voters rides home from the polls, even if long lines mean they are there later than 8 p.m. Money 'left on the table' With limited funding options provided to STARS through federal and state sources, the citywide 3-mill property tax levy and fares, Steffens said the authority is looking elsewhere for revenue. "STARS is currently looking into maximizing our funding options," he said. After he took the reins in July, Steffens said he has identified federal and state dollars "that have been left on the table" in the past. He said the authority is working with Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) and FTA officials to "recoup some of that money," preferably in a lump sum that can be used to replace at least a portion of the system's aging bus fleet. "What that means is we might be able to get a good shot in the arm and get some buses on the road that are brand new," Steffens said. "That's a big goal of mine." With several buses that are up to 20 years old, he estimated about 25 vehicles need to be replaced as soon as possible. But the authority is also addressing issues on the expenditure side of its budget. "We've eliminated some tiers of management," Steffens said.  He said staffing changes are expected to result in "a couple thousand dollars in savings" in the STARS budget. Steffens credited the authority's current staff for doing more with less and taking all the recent changes in stride. "The staff over at STARS is doing a fantastic job," he said. "We've been cut down to the bone and the people that are left are the people who really care. And they're working very hard to service this city." New route planning Another change coming down the road for STARS, Steffens said, is the result of a reestablished planning department, which has set its sights on reexamining the system's bus routes. "The routes that we have currently, they're based on what the city was 30 years ago," he said. "This city is not what it was 30 years ago. People have moved, business locations have changed, the needs have changed and STARS needs to address that." Steffens said planners hope to create a "train-proof" route system that will only rarely need to cross the city's railroad tracks, which often contribute to delays. "Those are one of our biggest hold-ups," he said. Bus riders saw delays of 15 minutes or more earlier this fall, when students returning to school overwhelmed the system. Steffens said staff has worked through that issue and assured city leaders that buses are now, on average, running less than five minutes behind. 'Getting creative' with partnerships The next big issue to tackle for STARS, he said, would be identifying "new revenue sources" to help extend services the system offers while still living within its means. "We're getting creative," Steffens said. "We're looking at new partnerships; partnerships with businesses, with universities." He said a recent pilot project funded by Saginaw Valley State University to ferry students between the school's campus, local retailers and their apartments, was "very successful." Steffens said STARS is also reaching out to the state's Community Ventures job program to see if the authority could provide a self-sustaining "ride to work program." "These are the bridges to providing new service, to opening up routes," he said. "But we need to be very careful to temper our expectations, given the limited resources and the limited buses that we have." Steffens was thanked for his efforts by several members of City Council Monday. "I'm excited about the changes," Councilwoman Brenda Moore said. 'Starting to move forward' Mayor Pro Tem Floyd Kloc praised Steffens and others involved in the recent changes for "taking charge." "It sounds very encouraging," Kloc said. Mayor Dennis Browning, who was appointed to the STARS Board of Directors earlier this year, congratulated Steffens and the rest of the authority's staff for creating what he called "a new beginning" for the community's public transit system. "It has just been so exciting to see what's happening with STARS in the last several months," Browning said. "We are no longer treading water. We are starting to move forward." Though a lot has changed in a very short time, Steffens assured city officials that he and other leaders at STARS are carefully considering possibilities before making any decisions. "I'm here to reassure you that, although some people might say STARS is moving pretty fast, it's very deliberate," he said. "We're being very careful that we're not going to overextend ourselves."

Ashers refused to create a cake (pictured above) with a "Support Gay Marriage" slogan, and an image of Sesame Street characters Bert and Ernie. The request was made by a homosexual rights activist identified by BBC News as Gareth Lee. The bakery has served Lee in the past, Arthur told the court, but he turned Lee down because of the cake's message. That business decision mirrors other ethical situations, such as a Kentucky print shop that refused to print t-shirts for a homosexual pride event. A judge ruled last year that Blaine Adamson and Hands on Originals had turned down other orders that conflicted with his religious beliefs and therefore ruled in his favor. The Human Rights Commission in Lexington sought to punish Adamson, and the Ashers' case was similarly prosecuted by the Northern Ireland Equality Commission.  More recently, bakery employees at a Wal-Mart in Georgia refused to bake a "Blue Lives Matter" cake because they considered the theme racist. A second Wal-Mart store in Louisiana refused a Confederate flag-themed cake requested by a customer. The next decision for McArthur is to drop cakes from his business or make a final plea to the Supreme Court, says Dr. Sharon James of the Coalition for Marriage. "This Christian business would not do anything to compromise their beliefs," she says of McArthur and the family-owned bakery. "They've stood firm all the way through this." Meanwhile, says James, the McArthur family has won the respect and admiration of others during the two-year legal battle. "Who disagree with their religion and disagree with their beliefs," she says, "but say that they should have the right to follow their conscience." The decision of the appeals court, meanwhile, is that there is no such right. "The fact that a baker provides a cake for a particular team, or portrays witches on a Halloween cake, does not indicate any support for either," the Appeals Court claimed in its ruling, the BBC reported.   Praising the Appeals Court decision, a spokesman for a homosexual rights group said ironically that "faith is important but faith cannot set aside equality legislation that has been long sought." The senior judge accepted that Ashers didn't know Lee was homosexual and therefore didn't discriminate against him due to his sexual orientation. But the court insisted the bakery should have approved the cake's message anyway. "Which is even more alarming," says James, "because the law is being used to force people to endorse a message with which they disagree."

REUTERS/Abhishek N. Chinnappa/File PhotoMore MUMBAI (Reuters) - India's largest e-commerce firm Flipkart said on Tuesday its chief financial officer would leave the company at the end of this year. The departure of Sanjay Baweja comes during the Indian festive season, a crucial time for sales, and as Flipkart engages in talks with U.S. retailer Wal-Mart Stores Inc to raise up to $1 billion for a minority stake. Baweja joined Flipkart in September 2014. A Flipkart spokesman said Dec. 31 would be Baweja's last day at the company and the search for a replacement had begun. Flipkart, launched in 2007 by two former Amazon employees, sells a wide range of products from mobile phones to suitcases and cosmetics. Current investors include Tiger Global Management and Accel Partners. The Economic Times newspaper reported earlier that Baweja had left Flipkart.

READ MORE READ MORE READ MORE Share Ari Levy Oct 25th 2016 11:50AM Mark Lopreiato was thrilled when he was invited to promote his Forearm Forklift on ABC's "Good Morning America" last month. The chance for a small manufacturing business to reach 4.5 million viewers for free doesn't come around often. Lopreiato appeared on "Buy it and Try It," a segment for hosts to test out popular niche gizmos from infomercials in front of an enthusiastic New York studio audience. The first product they tried was a steel nonstick pan, which smoothly cooked up eggs without the use of oil or butter.

After viewing a commercial for the product, ABC's Lara Spencer and Gio Benitez pulled the heavy-duty moving straps over their forearms and proceeded to lift up a washing machine and walk with it. "I was pretty impressed," Spencer said to the crowd. You'd think such a shout-out from the hugely popular morning show would provide a huge boost for Lopreiato's 18-year-old family business.

Jewelry Up Next See Gallery Discover More Like This of SEE ALL BACK TO SLIDE SHOW CAPTION + HIDE CAPTION – But this is Amazon.com's world, and Forearm Forklift, like so many brands, is uncomfortably inhabiting it. Once a thriving product for movers and contractors available at a dozen big-box retailers including Wal-Mart, Target and AutoZone, Forearm Forklift has been ravaged over the past half-decade by counterfeiters, mostly selling on Amazon. Scores of merchants have copied the patented product, using its name, images and labels and undercutting the real Forearm Forklift on price. When "Good Morning America" viewers go online to buy a set, which retails between $20 and $25, odds are they'll be purchasing someone else's product. "It just keeps funneling business to the knockoffs," said Lopreiato, 48, whose wife Sophia also works at the company and traveled with him to New York. "It's almost like winning the lottery if they choose our item." Forearm Forklift is hanging on by a thread. The company is down to 21 full-time employees from 52 at its peak and recorded less than $500 in profit last year. Annual revenue in 2008 topped $4 million and has since plunged 30 percent. Retailers stopped placing orders because they were finding what appeared to be the same thing online for much cheaper. Photo: Jeniece Pettitt, CNBC Lopreiato has diversified his product line, adding a harness for the shoulders, a strap that goes over a single shoulder and straps for carrying boxes. But nothing has come close to replicating the success of his flagship Forearm Forklift. Meanwhile, Lopreiato bears the costs of workers' compensation, product quality control, commercial insurance, mortgage payments and patent management fees all so counterfeiters can act as freeloaders. "We're competing with people who are stealing our brand, stealing our pictures and stealing our intellectual property," Lopreiato said in an interview last week from his 20,000-square foot warehouse in Baldwin Park, about 20 miles east of Los Angeles. Amazon's growing dominance in commerce brings with it plenty of collateral damage. The counterfeit problem, in particular, goes largely undiscussed by CEO Jeff Bezos and ignored by investors and analysts. The stock has climbed 37 percent over the last 12 months making Amazon the world's fourth-most valuable company, and 89 percent of analysts tracked by FactSet say shareholders should buy more.

Analysts at Pacific Crest Securities, in their earnings preview, called Amazon "one of the most disruptive forces in retail and technology today." Conversations with merchants elicit a very different reaction. Since CNBC.com began reporting on Amazon's budding counterfeit issue in May, we've spoken with dozens of merchants that have narratives similar to Lopreiato's, but very few are willing to speak on the record out of fear of retribution from Amazon. Lopreiato, an Army veteran and father of two middle-school daughters, said he felt compelled to tell his story. "If Jeff Bezos knew exactly what was happening to us, he'd do the right thing," he said. "It's not that he's a bad guy. It's that there is, in my opinion, a lot of pressure put on folks at Amazon to increase sales, increase sales, increase sales. That's wonderful. That's the American way. But do it right." EXPLORE MORE: The 21 largest US cities ranked by ease of building wealth Amazon's obsessive focus on pleasing consumers with discounts and service has come at the expense of brands like Forearm Forklift. In trying to provide the lowest-cost option for virtually every product on the planet, the company opened the doors to merchants from across the globe with little respect for intellectual property, despite an anti-counterfeiting policy that prohibits the sale of inauthentic items. That's enabled manufacturers largely from China to take advantage of cheaper production and labor costs to compete on the Amazon market. Some big brands have voiced their concerns. Birkenstock said in July that it's no longer authorizing sales on Amazon starting in 2017. Last week Apple sued a distributor named Mobile Star for selling counterfeit power adapters and charging cables on the site, claiming the products "pose an immediate threat to consumer safety." Amazon has taken steps to crack down of late by forcing new sellers of major brands like Nike, Hasbro and Cuisinart to show invoices proving the items are legitimate and then pay a fee. Third-party sellers are getting suspended in droves for activity that Amazon deems suspicious or for complaints from buyers, sparking outrage from merchants who say they're being punished for Amazon's inability to control counterfeiting. "Amazon has zero tolerance for the sale of counterfeits," a company spokesperson said in an e-mailed statement. "We are working closely with manufacturers and brands to identify offenders, and removing fraudulent items from our catalog. We are also taking action and aggressively pursuing bad actors in this space." The company didn't offer a comment on Forearm Forklift's situation. Until now, Forearm Forklift has been forced to self-police the site and take action to get unauthorized listings removed. See an infringer? Send a cease-and-desist letter. Suspicious of a counterfeit? Buy it, and prove to Amazon through a formal complaint that the listing should be taken down. Repeat, repeat, repeat. And pray it works. On the second floor of Forearm Forklift's warehouse, Lopreiato opens a closet filled floor-to-ceiling with cardboard boxes from Amazon purchases. Inside each, supposedly, is a version of his product. There's no subtlety. The packaging includes not only his name and label but images of his family members and co-workers moving washing machines, armoires and exercise equipment. Open a box and find orange straps that are either too thin, too short, have loose stitching or are made of entirely different and weaker material. Lopreiato said he's submitted more than 100 cease-and-desist letters to third-party sellers and takedown notices to Amazon. But go to Amazon today, and infringers are easy to spot. One listing for furniture moving straps contains an image that looks like a couple of seat belts. Among the attached photos is one of Mark's wife moving a mattress. In a July 2015 e-mail to Amazon's patent team, Marty Proops, an Amazon marketplace expert who previously worked with Forearm Forklift on its account, said he and Lopreiato had identified 53 separate sellers offering infringing products over the past year. Buyers who assume they're getting the real thing are dismayed when the product can't possibly help them move a 300-pound refrigerator. Thus, Forearm Forklift has one-star reviews from customers calling it a "cheap knockoff (don't purchase)" and "very obvious counterfeit." "That posts on our offer page on Amazon so a lot of people think we're offering fakes," Lopreiato said. He never expected this to be easy. He developed the original contraption while working as a mover and dealing with clients who didn't want dollies rolling across new wooden floors. Carrying items by hand meant bending down with 200-pound appliances to get through doorways. Lopreiato got started renting a small warehouse in 1998 and had so little money that he lived in the office. He had an evening gig at a law firm doing clerical work and waited tables on weekends. For 12 years, Lopreiato built the business by attending trade shows and networking with distributors and buyers. He forged deals with companies ranging from U-Haul and Home Depot to Ross Stores andCanadian Tire. He was on QVC every two months or so starting in 2003, selling more than 20,000 Forearm Forklifts per live show at the peak. He started selling to Amazon as a vendor that same year, but it was never a big part of his business, representing under 2 percent of revenue in 2008. Lopreiato was fully prepared for competition, knowing that patent protection only goes so far. But he never expected a counterfeiting onslaught. The slide started in 2010. He got a call from an Amazon employee, saying that other sellers were offering his product at a much lower price and he needed to cut his rate to keep the business. Lopreiato investigated and quickly found the rival products were fakes. He told Amazon that he would aggressively defend his intellectual property but that he couldn't compete with those prices and still make money. Amazon was unhappy with that response, and within weeks there were more than 100 knockoffs on the site, Lopreiato said. "Since that date, it's just been absolutely downhill," he said. Over the past six years, Lopreiato has seen vendor managers come and go without fixing the problem or notifying him that they're leaving. He forwarded a number of e-mails from the past two years, where he and Proops showed explicit infringement and asked for help. In addition to jeopardizing Forearm Forklift's business, Proops wrote in June 2015, "Sooner or later an Amazon customer is going to be seriously injured by one of these cheap knockoffs!" Responses ranged from terse to deflecting. Amazon told Proops to send complaints to generic e-mail addresses copyright@amazon.com and patents@amazon.com. Other e-mails suggested that the company was looking into the matter, but then the account would move to another representative. In July 2015, an Amazon lawyer told Proops by e-mail that Forearm Forklift should take up infringement matters directly with the third-party sellers. "At this time we consider this matter closed and we will take no further action," he wrote. C.J. Rosenbaum, a lawyer who represents Amazon sellers, said the rapid turnover in vendor managers and inconsistency in how they treat issues is a constant source of frustration. "Amazon's responses are very erratic," said Rosenbaum, who recently published the "Amazon Law Library," a book compiling the legal issues surrounding the company and platform. "You can send in one complaint through the system about an IP violation and they take down the listing, and submit the same exact thing again and just fail." For Lopreiato, legal action presents an expensive option with little upside. Individually going after infringers, who he'd first have to track down, would require more time and money than he's got in the bank. He filed one case in 2013 against a domestic company and was awarded a settlement before trial. Taking on Amazon directly has been a nonstarter for the three intellectual property lawyers Lopreiato has contacted. More than anything, he needs Amazon's help. With traditional retailers sinking fast and more retail and wholesale activity shifting to Amazon, Forearm Forklift now counts on the site for about 12 percent of revenue, a number that's growing despite the flood of counterfeits. A tiny number of additional orders rolled in after the "Good Morning America" appearance, even though Lopreiato is certain that far more went to the knockoffs. Similarly, a Facebook page called Impressive Things posted Forearm Forklift's commercial earlier this month, generating 909,000 views and counting. Again, more revenue for the fakes. On Friday morning, Lopreiato received a particularly discouraging call. Aafes, a retailer targeting military communities, had been planning to buy Forearm Forklift for 120 of its stores. The representative handling the deal was calling Lopreiato because an Aafes executive had discovered lookalikes on Amazon for a much lower price. He e-mailed a screenshot showing two different sellers using Forearm Forklift's photos (including the one below) to promote their products, one for $8.09 and the other for $11.24. Lopreiato is all too familiar with this routine. He replied with a lengthy apology and offered assurance that the cheaper products are fakes. He gave his standard "buyer beware" pitch, explaining that the knockoffs are low quality, unsafe and uninsured. He's not at all confident that it will be enough. In a text message on Friday afternoon, Lopreiato wrote, "Another prospect will probably be lost."

Kena Betancur, Getty Images Retailers such as Macy?s are hoping to get people to shop at physical locations as time runs out to place online orders. NEW YORK, NY - NOVEMBER 26: Customers shop in Macy's flagship store in Herald Square on Thanksgiving evening for early Black Friday sales on November 26, 2015 in New York City. Security has been heightened in Herald Square and around the city as thousands of shoppers flock to stores for sales on the kickoff to the Christmas shopping season. (Photo by Kena Betancur/Getty Images) ORG XMIT: 593487083 ORIG FILE ID: 498871684 (Photo: Kena Betancur, Getty Images) Like the arrival of Santa’s sleigh on Christmas Eve, each year retailers deliver a host of deals, discounts and freebies for shoppers as part of a highly anticipated shopping event called Black Friday, which falls on the day after Thanksgiving. Many of the deals are legitimate bargains, but others are nothing more than ordinary sales wrapped in shiny packaging. How can you tell the difference? We have the secrets you need to know about the annual discount shopping bonanza, which this year is Nov. 25. 1. Doorbusters are few and far between Doorbusters are the blockbusters of Black Friday. They’re deeply discounted products that are available for only a limited window of time — usually on Thanksgiving Day or Black Friday. The products look good, and the prices certainly sound good, but the reality of actually getting your hands on one of these items isn’t so rosy. In 2015, for instance, Sears plastered a Kenmore Elite washer and dryer on the front page of its Black Friday ad, with the promise of 51% off on the pair. But the fine print below the deal revealed that there were approximately only four available per store. The story is similar at other retailers. If you don’t secure a spot at the front of the line or log online the moment a sale starts, you could miss your shot at these big deals. Shoppers should look for stores with doorbuster guarantees. In some cases, as long as you arrive at a certain time, you can be guaranteed the low price. 2. Discounts are often inflated Deals can be difficult to grab, but they can also be misleading. Last year, a NerdWallet study found that major department stores inflated the amount of some of their Black Friday discounts to make deals appear better than they actually were. For instance, depending on where you shopped, the same-priced coffee maker could have looked like a better bargain. The Keurig K45 Elite Single-Serve Coffee or Tea Brewing System was on sale for $89.99 at Macy’s and Kohl’s during Black Friday 2015 and for $89.98 at Stage. But each of these retailers advertised a different regular retail price: $174.99 for Macy’s, $149.99 for Kohl’s and $119.98 for Stage. If you shopped at Macy’s, it looked like you were saving $85, but at Kohl’s, it appeared you were saving only $60 — despite the fact that the product was on sale for the identical price. If you shop this year on Black Friday, don’t pay attention to the supposed percentage of the discounts. Instead, judge the value of a product based on the sale price and how it compares with the item’s price at other stores. Skip Ad Ad Loading... x Embed x Share REI’s 149 stores will remain closed and online orders will not be processed, but employees will still be paid for the day off. Time 3. Price matching may be exempt Price matching is a common practice that allows customers to show retailers proof of a lower price elsewhere on an identical product and ask the store to match that competitor’s price. But many retailers suspend their price-matching policies on Black Friday. At Target, “Price matching and adjustments will not be allowed for prices from Thanksgiving Day through the end of the following week, whether offered by Target or a competitor. Exclusion dates are November 24 through December 3.” Similarly, Wal-Mart’s policy reads, “Walmart.com will not price match items on Walmart.com or to other retailers between Thanksgiving and Cyber-Monday,” which this year is Nov. 28. On Black Friday 2015, Wal-Mart stores would match the price of any local competitor’s ad for an identical product, but some exclusions applied. When price matching is largely off the table, it’s up to the shopper to compare prices and research which store has the best offer. AZCENTRAL Mall of America to close for Thanksgiving 4. Fine print is everywhere Finally, even if you manage to avoid all of the above tricks and traps, you could still be faced with more fine print. Retailers have a way of making some sales difficult to actually claim. Certain deals may require completion of a mail-in rebate. Other products are available at their advertised sale price only for a few hours and then go up in price. Keep an eye out for such fine print and exclusions — usually located at the bottom of a Black Friday ad or beneath individual deals within the ad — so you aren’t surprised when you get to the store on Black Friday.

 Amazon is about to become the biggest clothing retailer in the US Hayley Peterson Oct. 25, 2016, 12:14 PM 15,248 facebook linkedin twitter email print An ad for Amazon Fashion. Facebook/Amazon Fashion Amazon is expected to surpass Macy's to become the biggest apparel seller in the US next year, according to a new 58-page report from Cowen & Co. The shift would represent a huge shake-up for the apparel industry, which has long been dominated by department stores like Macy's, Nordstrom, and JCPenney, as well as big-box retailers including Walmart and Target. Amazon is a relative newcomer to the fashion world, and it has made a swift rise to the top. The company's clothing and accessory sales are expected to grow nearly 30% next year, to $28 billion, according to the Cowen analysts. Macy's apparel sales, by comparison, are expected to drop 4%, to $22 billion, in the period. As Amazon's sales grow, so will its share of the apparel market in the US. Amazon currently claims about 6.6% of the market. That share is expected to increase to 8.2% by next year and further expand to 16.2% within five years, according to Cowen analysts. By 2021, Cowen expects Amazon to generate $62 billion in annual apparel sales. TJ Maxx is expected to be the No. 2 clothing seller, with $26 billion in sales, and Macy's is expected to claim the No. 3 spot, with $23 billion in sales. Over the past couple of years, Amazon has ramped up its investment in fashion by launching its own private-label clothing brands and sponsoring the first New York men's fashion week. Macy's is losing market share to Amazon. David Ramos/Getty Images The company has also hired executives from luxury fashion companies, such as Julie Gilhart, the Barneys New York fashion director whom Amazon reportedly hired as a consultant, and Vogue editor Caroline Palmer. Also in the past few years, Amazon has started to shift its fashion strategy toward offering more high-end designer names such as Zac Posen and Stuart Weitzman. That shift has had some industry experts scratching their heads. Luxury fashion websites are typically well merchandised and highly curated — not things for which Amazon is necessarily known. Amazon's weaknesses with curation were highlighted in a shopper survey conducted in July by Cowen & Co. "Amazon Fashion got a very lukewarm review for site personalization and ease of use," Cowen analyst John Kernan said in a conference call on Tuesday. Shoppers said it "wasn't particularly easy to browse." Amazon also has the disadvantage of having no brick-and-mortar stores where shoppers can try on items or return purchases, he said. So why do people choose to shop on Amazon for clothes? Amazon Prime is the biggest lure for customers, according to Cowen & Co. Shoppers cited the convenience and free two-day shipping as the biggest advantage of shopping for clothes on Amazon. They also praised Amazon's customer service and breadth of product reviews.

Terre Haute Assistant Chief of Police Shawn Keen says they arrested 28-year-old Benjamin Selig of Rockville on a felony count of assisting a criminal. They also arrested 25-year-old Kathleen Featherstone on charges of felony murder, robbery, and burglary charges. Police say additional arrests could be made as the investigation continues. Just after 11 p.m. Monday the body of Matt Luecking was discovered in a bedroom on Jackboot Court. That's inside the Village Quarter apartment complex at State Road 46 and Poplar Drive on Terre Haute's eastside. Terre Haute Police say initial observations of Luecking's body indicated that of a homicide. After a brief search of the area couldn't turn up the victim's car. Police then issued an advisory to surrounding agencies; they say within an hour Vermillion County Police informed them that two men tried to use Luecking's credit card and identity at the Walmart in Clinton. Walmart loss prevention became suspicious of the two males when one of the individual started looking for the identification in order to sign for the purchase. When the pair left the store they inadvertently left behind the ID belonging to Luecking. Walmart provided the license plate number of the pairs get-a-way vehicle along with security video to Terre Haute Police; with that information the agency went to the home where the vehicle was registered. Once on the scene police noticed the duo loading item's into Luecking's Chevy Cobalt. Police arrested 24-year-old John Collins, of Terre Haute. Collins faces a murder charge. The investigation continues. Matt Luecking worked at Terre Haute Savings Bank. He was also a known Disc Jockey on Terre Haute's WFNB 92.7 and he operated a entertainment and DJ Business. Luecking was well-known in the Wabash Valley. He often appeared at public events, including many ribbon cutting ceremonies for the Terre Haute Chamber of Commerce, where he served as an ambassador.

A positive reaction to the latest batch of earnings news may contribute to early strength on Wall Street. U.S. stocks advanced solidly on Monday amid news on the merge-and-acquisition front. The major averages opened higher and moved roughly sideways for the rest of the session, ending moderately to notably higher. The Dow Industrials added 77.32 points or 0.43 percent before ending at over a 2-week high of 18,223 and the S&P 500 Index closed 10.17 points or 0.47 percent higher at 2,151, also a 2-week high. The Nasdaq Composite Index ended at 5,310, up 52.43 points or 1 percent. Among the sectors, retail and semiconductor stocks gained ground, but gold and oil service stocks moved notably to the downside. Twenty-one of the thirty Dow components closed the session higher, while nine stocks retreated. Microsoft (MSFT), Boeing (BA) and Wal-Mart (WMT) were among the biggest gainers of the session. On the economic front, the flash estimate released by Markit showed that its manufacturing PMI rose to 53.2 in October from 51.4 in September, while economists expected a reading of 51.4. The Chicago Federal Reserve's national activity index improved yet remained depressed in September. The index rose to -0.14 from -0.55. Commodity, Currency Markets Crude oil futures are slipping $0.09 to $50.43 a barrel after ending Monday's session down $0.33 at $50.52 a barrel. Meanwhile, an ounce of gold is trading at $1,270.40, up $6.70 from the previous session's close of $1,263.70. On Monday, gold fell $4. On the currency front, the U.S. dollar is trading at 104.78 yen compared to the 104.18 yen it fetched at the close of New York trading on Monday. Against the euro, the dollar is valued at $1.0860 compared to yesterday's $1.0882. Asia The Asian markets moved about in a lackluster manner before ending mixed. Even amid concerns about a Fed rate hike, a weaker yen and better-than-expected GDP data from South Korea helped to cap overall losses to some extent. The Japanese market ended at a six-month high as the yen remained subdued. The Nikkei 225 Index opened higher and moved roughly sideways for the rest of the session, ending up 30.83 points or 0.76 percent to 17,365, the highest level since April 25. Among the prominent gainers, J Front Retailing, Nippon Sheet Glass, Dainippon Screen Manufacturing, Sumitomo Mitsui Trust, TDK, Mitsui Mining & Smelting and Mitsubishi Motors jumped 3-7 percent. Hitachi, Nissan Motor, Toyota, Honda Motor, Suzuki Motor and Mazda rallied 1-3 percent. Kyushu Railway shares soared 15 percent on their first day of trading. Australia stocks also rose, as higher metal prices boosted miners and banks gained ground ahead of earnings results from three of the big four banks. Healthcare stocks also rebounded from a recent string of losses. The All Ordinaries index closed 34.20 points or 0.62 percent higher at 5,523. Chinese shares ended on a flat note as the yuan continued to weaken to hit a fresh six-year low. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index inched up 3.69 points or 0.12 percent to 3,132, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng index closed 38.97 points or 0.17 percent lower at 23,565. In economic news, data released by the Bank of Korea showed that South Korea's third-quarter GDP grew by 0.7 sequentially, beating forecasts for 0.6 percent growth. On an annual basis, the economy expanded 2.7 percent, marking the slowest growth in more than a year amid a massive recall of Samsung smartphones and strikes at Hyundai Motor. Europe European stocks opened higher and have been witnessing buoyancy amid the release of some domestic earnings news and German business confidence data. In major corporate news, French telecom giant Orange reported higher third quarter earnings, while it maintained its 2016 forecast. Novartis (NVS) reported an increase in third quarter profit. Core earnings per share were ahead of estimates, while sales were impacted by generic competition and pricing. Syngenta's third quarter sales fell 3 percent, while excluding the impact of the change in sales terms in Brazil, sales rose 2 percent. On the economic front, confidence among German businesses improved in October, the results of a survey by the Ifo institute showed. The Ifo business confidence index rose to 110.5 in October from 109.5 in the prior month. Economists had expected a reading of 109.6. The current conditions index climbed to 115.0 from 114.7 a month ago. The index was forecast to rise marginally to 114.9. At the same time, the expectations index came in at 106.1 versus 104.5 in the prior month. U.S. Economic Reports The Conference Board is scheduled to release its consumer confidence index for October at 10 am ET. The consensus estimate calls for a reading of 101, down from 104.1 in September. The consumer confidence index for September unexpectedly rose to a post-recession high of 104.1 in September from a revised 101.8 in August. Economists had expected the index to drop to 98.8. The assessment of the labor market was upbeat. The present situation index climbed 3.2 points to 128.5, and the expectations index rose to 87.8 from 86.1. Also at 10 am ET, the Richmond Federal Reserve is due to release its regional manufacturing index for October. In September, the index was at -8. The Treasury Department is set to announce the results of its auction of 2-year notes at 1 pm ET. Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank President Dennis Lockhart will give a speech to the Opportunity Finance Network in Atlanta at 1:20 pm ET.

By Graham Lanktree October 25, 2016 15:22 BST Republican US presidential nominee Donald Trump hugs a US flag as he comes onstage at a rally in Tampa, FloridaJonathan Ernst/ Reuters Two economists are voicing their support for Donald Trump's plan to "rip up" trade agreements like NAFTA and the TPP if he becomes president. However, other experts, including the head of America's biggest bank, say it will make Americans poorer. After ripping them up "we're going to make really good ones," Trump said early this year during a campaign stop in Portland, Maine. At the end of September the Republican candidate released a seven-point plan that includes renegotiating NAFTA with Canada and Mexico, pulling out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) — a pending international trade deal — and labelling China a currency manipulator, among others. "Ironically that would actually hurt Trump supporters most," said Michael Plouffe, an International Political Economy expert at UCL, of Trump's idea to renegotiate NAFTA. "Things like textiles and apparel would become more expensive," he added, because they would not be made with cheap Mexican labour anymore. "H&M, Walmart, Target — the things that people would look for something that provides good value — would no longer be good value," he said. Trump's trade plan "would be very, very harmful," Plouffe continued, because even though it would protect small enterprises it would decrease trade and investment in the economy and in large enterprises "which are associated with overall gains." The TPP, an even larger trade deal than NAFTA that is waiting to be signed, "would be positive for GDP," said James Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, the largest of the four biggest American banks, at a talk in September in Washington D.C. "It would be positive for wages. It would be positive for the average American," he said. "It has negatives, which have to be recognized," Dimon added, saying the deal's impact on smaller business needs to be acknowledged and combined with government "income assistance, redevelopment, relocation, retraining, so that those hurt by it can be made better". In an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal today (25 October), economists Wilbur Ross and Peter Navarro defend Trump's economic plan, as well as his tax cuts for some of the very wealthiest Americans. They say his policies will "double" the country's economic growth rate and "generate trillions of additional tax revenues." To get there "muscular trade negotiations" will "increase exports, reduce imports and eliminate cheating," they said. Hillary Clinton's tax hikes on businesses and wealthy Americans would discourage people from working hard and investing, they said. However, "one of the things that you see with any trade deal is that larger, more productive firms really benefit," said Plouffe, and "small mom and pop shops lose out." Of Trump's plan, he said, "there's a lot of fluffy language against the usual antagonists."

Current rent on weeknights is $110, and $135 on weekends, with a minimum stay of one night. by Nancy Peevy. Published Oct 25th, 2016 8:14 am nancywpeevy@gmail.com / @tbarkansas Sharing isn’t new. But the way people are sharing is new. Your mother’s encouragement to share nicely is moving from a polite social activity to a profitable business. The aptly named “sharing economy” is a platform for sharing goods or services with people who want to use them either for free or for a fee, typically by means of the internet. A 2015 PricewaterhouseCoopers study found that 72% of Americans have used some type of shared or on-demand online service like eBay or Craigslist, ride-hailing apps like Uber, or online home-sharing services like Airbnb or Vacation Rentals By Owner (VRBO). The latter two provide a way for people looking for overnight accommodations in a particular place to find people who want to rent out an extra room or an entire house. The study also found that what consumers liked best about the sharing economy was saving money and having a “unique experience.” In recognizing this, Airbnb is using the tag line, “Live there” which encourages travelers who use its service to live like a local while they are renting someone else’s space. ‘SELLING AN EXPERIENCE’ That’s exactly what Ryan and Michelle Malashock offer guests who stay in their 600-square-foot guest house near downtown Bentonville. Their rental is listed on Airbnb, VRBO and FlipKey. “We are selling an experience, not just a place to stay. [Guests] get to live our lifestyle in a weird way, live downtown where we live,” Michelle, age 33, said. “They get to experience things how we experience them.” Ryan, 36, said their guests’ experience is enhanced because they stay with people who can tell them what to see in town. “We can tell them to go to Table Mesa, go get a crepe, walk down to the taco truck … walk to Compton Gardens, go on the Crystal Bridges Trail,” he said. “What I personally love is when I see [our guests] out and around town enjoying the city. I’ll be at the farmer’s market, and I’ll see my guests walking around having a great time,” Michelle said. “I love that I feel pride that they are loving Bentonville as much as I do.” It was Valentine’s Day, 2015 when Michelle first saw the home and potential home-sharing opportunity. The property, which included the two bedroom, single-bath guest house located behind the main home, was for sale by owner. Michelle told her husband they were going to buy the home and “do an Airbnb.” “And my husband thought I was crazy. But the same day he saw the house, and he fell in love with it too,” she said, adding that the extra income helped them afford the property. MOUNTAIN BIKERS, CORPORATE GUESTS In the past 18 months, the Malashocks have booked the guesthouse 88 times with travelers from 25 states ranging from Texas to Oregon, and Washington, D.C., and from Israel. Next summer they will add to their international guest list with a booking from Germany. Stays last anywhere from one night to six weeks. Their renters included art aficionados coming to see Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art, corporate relocations, groups of women on girls’ trips, two young women and their father who came during Walmart’s Shark Tank week to pitch a product, mountain bikers coming to ride the trails and a family that stayed six weeks while the mother was interning at the Wal-Mart home office pharmacy. Michelle said one of the most interesting groups to stay in the house was an up and coming American folk band made up of three sisters from Portland, Ore. “The band Joseph stayed here,” she said. “Months later they were on [‘The Tonight Show Starring] Jimmy Fallon.’ I’m like, that band stayed at our house, and that’s pretty cool!” The guesthouse sleeps six, includes a full kitchen and a full-sized washer and dryer, and the Malashocks welcome children and dogs. Current rent on weeknights is $110, and $135 on weekends, with a minimum stay of one night. Ryan said taxes are absorbed into the cost of the rental, but there is a cleaning fee of $50 and a VRBO or Airbnb service fee that are passed on to guests. Prices are increased for special events like the Bentonville Film Festival. Michelle said they charge less than other rentals because they want to be competitive and want to keep the guest house full. The house is rented about 75% of the time throughout any month. “We’ve never gone more than five days without someone in it,” Michelle said. A recent check of the Airbnb website showed Northwest Arkansas (NWA) offered 300-plus locations costing an average of $156 per night. VRBO listed approximately 250 rentals in NWA. Some rentals, like the Malashocks’s, may be listed on both sites. ‘SECLUDED’ IN SPRINGDALE Arthur and Leslie Ray, ages 55 and 60, offer a different experience to guests at their “charming, secluded bungalow” on 5 acres in Springdale, via Airbnb, VRBO and Craigslist. “I think that a lot of people book here because we have a very private location. There are people that want to be downtown, want to be within walking distance, they want to be part of the action, the noise, the music. But, there’s people that want that during the day, but at night they don’t want that,” Ray said. When the Rays bought their property in the late ‘90s, the bungalow, in great disrepair, came with it. After building a home on the land, the Rays decided to repair the bungalow. In the midst of the repairs a hailstorm damaged the roof and before the roof could be replaced, another hailstorm demolished everything inside the house. At that point, the Ray’s insurance paid to have the house gutted and totally re-done. “After it was repaired my husband said we should explore using it as a short term rental online. But, we thought, Arkansas, seriously? Who’s going to want to come here?” Ray said. In the years since, the Rays have found a good market for their 1,200-square-foot, three-bedroom, two-bath bungalow, which sleeps eight. The bungalow is rented about 35% of the time, which is satisfactory for the Rays. “We didn’t buy this place to make it a rental,” Ray said. “It pays us enough so we’re able to keep up with expenses with a maybe a little bit of profit left over.” The Rays have hosted a wide variety of guests such as motorcycle riders for Bikes, Blues & BBQ; families in town for a wedding, fans attending Razorback football games, attendees of the Bentonville Film Festival, and families coming to enjoy Beaver Lake in the summer. “There is one group of ladies that’s come two or three times for the War Eagle Fair,” Leslie said. “I love them! They are all older, like me and it’s like a ladies’ weekend out. There’s seven or eight of them and they all stay here, and they all bunk together. And I guess it’s like a sleepover for them.” Ray said she had a guest come from Norway. “It just so happened that we were on a trip ourselves, and there was a snowstorm here. And it took out our internet service. She was really counting on internet to communicate with all her friends and relatives. I felt so bad because there was nothing I could do,” she said. To make up for the inconvenience, Ray gave her a $150 refund and directed her to several places in town that did have internet. “I will do anything to avoid getting a bad review,” Ray said. “We really do go out of our way.” The bungalow rents for $200 per weeknight with a two-night minimum, plus a $100 cleaning fee, taxes and the VRBO or Airbnb service fee. There is also a $250 refundable damage deposit. On weekends the rent is $225 per night, with prices increased for special events in the area like Bikes, Blues & BBQ.

They won’t be able to move in for at least a year, but they can start planning, after the Batavia City Council voted final approval for the development at its Oct. 17 meeting. News stories about the 80-unit Windmill Manor project at 2400 Hawks Drive have generated calls to Batavia Mayor Jeff Schielke from people expressing interest in living there. “They’re already knocking on the door,” Schielke said about the complex, where residents must be 55 or older and most would pay rents below the market rate. Seventh Ward Alderman Dave Brown has received similar calls, as the project is located in his ward. Brown said the apartments being within walking distance of the Wal-Mart store is a plus. “This is certainly something we need in this town,” Brown said. Developer Chris Tritsis of JNB Batavia plans to begin grading the property before winter sets in, starting construction in earnest in the spring. The key to the project is a tax credit to the developer from the Illinois Housing Development Authority, allowing for the reduced rents. The one-bedroom units will rent for $800 a month, Tritsis said, while the two-bedroom units will be $940 a month. The apartments would remain rent- and age-restricted for 30 years, he said. Eight units will be rented out at market rate. Plans call for a three-story building on a 4.5-acre site on the south side of a curving section of Hawks Drive just west of Wal-Mart. The income limit for residents of the rent-restricted apartments will be $37,000, Tritsis said. There will be 60 one-bedroom apartments and 20 two-bedroom apartments, plus a basement apartment for an on-site manager. The parking lot will have 115 vehicle spaces. Each apartment in the L-shaped building will be cable-ready and have an exterior balcony, a fully-equipped kitchen and wireless internet. The building will include a main lobby as well as community, exercise, craft, computer and multimedia rooms, along with sitting areas, a library and beauty salon.

(NASDAQ: NEON), creators of the AirBar™ sensor, the streamlined device that instantly gives PCs touchscreen capabilities, today announces the official U.S. launch and shipment of AirBar pre-sale orders. Compatible with most Chromebook™ notebooks and PCs running Windows 8.1 or 10, AirBar provides consumers with the option to promptly and seamlessly activate touch functionalities on their laptops. This Smart News Release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20161025005568/en/ The AirBar device is a sleek, thin matte black bar that magnetically attaches to the bottom of a laptop display for easy installation. AirBar instantly connects through a USB port and requires no software installation or additional configuration. AirBar uses parent company Neonode's patented zForce AIR™ technology to emit an invisible light field over a laptop screen that senses touch from fingers, gloves and even a paintbrush.

"We developed this product knowing there is really nothing else like it on the market," said Remo Behdasht, senior vice president of AirBar Devices at Neonode. "People want touchscreen capabilities, but until now their options were very limited by brand and cost. Our successful pre-order phase was further confirmation of the massive appeal and demand for this device." AirBar alleviates battery drain, added weight and glare that typically comes with touchscreen laptops. AirBar retails for $69 and is offered in three size options to fit 13.3", 14" and 15.6" screens. AirBar is currently available at www.air.bar and will also be sold online at Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Best Buy (NYSE: BBY), CDW (NASDAQ: CDW), Dell, Newegg, and Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT).

Italian Inspired Snack Brand News provided by Pasta Chips Oct 25, 2016, 07:00 ET Share this article ORLANDO, Fla., Oct. 25, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Pasta Chips proudly announces a new investment from Advantage Capital Agribusiness Partners, LP (ACAP), along with Silas Capital and Emil Capital Partners, valued at $3 million. Founded by Florida-based entrepreneur Jerry Bello, Pasta Chips and the brand's new Pasta Bow Ties, offer unique, quality, Italian inspired snacks crafted from durum wheat semolina flour and baked as a better-for-you snacking alternative. The brand integrates farro, a higher protein grain for a more nutrient-dense product, and embeds fine seasonings based on regional Italian favorites for robust taste and crispy texture throughout. "At Pasta Chips we are recreating the pasta aisle in snack form using only fresh pasta dough and quality ingredients for a crispy, better-for-you dip and chip option," said Bello, founder and CEO of Pasta Chips. "We wanted to create Pasta Chips as a healthier alternative to the tasteless and overdone options in the deli aisle. We're dedicated to innovating new products to offer our consumers premium ingredient, gourmet taste, and snack food products that have a greater focus on nutrition." Continue Reading Pasta Chips' full flavor offerings to date. ACAP is a $154.5 million fund, licensed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) as a Rural Business Investment Company (RBIC). The fund is a partnership between Advantage Capital and nine Farm Credit organizations, established to bring together resources and people focused on providing more private capital, small business investment, and quality jobs to rural America. Farm Credit supports rural communities and agriculture with reliable, consistent access to credit and financial services. Pasta Chips will utilize the support to further accelerate the brand's rapid growth and awareness of the wholesome snack option. In addition, the brand will also be releasing new pasta product lines and innovations as well as increasing distribution from formative retailers including Walmart, Costco, Safeway, and more. Bello has been a driving force behind other successful food companies including Sensible Portions, Brownie Brittle, and Mamma Says. The snack entrepreneur was inspired to create Pasta Chips after an Italian vacation with his wife where he was served the traditional Italian dish – baked fresh pasta dough drizzled with olive oil. Soon after, Bello created the savory snack company utilizing baked pasta pieces as a delicious, better-for-you, and versatile cracker or chip option.  "Pasta Chips has been setting a new standard for products in the better-for-you snack aisle since the brand's launch in 2013," said Tyler Mayoras, principal at Advantage Capital. "This is a company that is innovating the snack brand marketplace and proving that baked chips can be regionally inspired, healthy, and tasty." About Pasta Chips Pasta Chips offers unique, quality, Italian inspired snacks crafted from durum wheat semolina flour and baked as a better-for-you snacking alternative. Borne out of the hills of Tuscany, Pasta Chips were inspired by Italy's gently baked fresh pasta, often drizzled with olive oil and served up in traditional osterias. Pasta Chips was the first to recreate this rich, traditional food, made with premium semolina flour, ancient grains and Italian herbs that have been celebrated for over 800 years. Whether straight from the bag, dipped or dressed and served, they are a great source of protein, cholesterol-free and contain 60 percent less fat than potato chips and 20 percent less fat than pita chips. In five flavors inspired by the sauces and tastes of Italy – Marinara, Alfredo, Spicy Tomato Basil, Garlic Olive Oil and Mediterranean Sea Salt – Pasta Chips are available at major retailers across the nation. For more information about Pasta Chips, please visit www.pastachips.com.

Dedicated to providing capital to companies in food and agribusiness industries, ACAP has selected Vintage Italia – founded by entrepreneur Jerry Bello – as the first company within the snack food category to receive support from the fund. One of the company’s brand names, Pasta Chips, is a baked alternative to the regular potato chip that uses higher protein grains like farro to increase nutrients. The investment will help the company accelerate its rapid growth, supporting its release of new product lines to large retailers, including Walmart, Costco and Safeway. “We’re the first in the industry to create the only snack food made from fresh pasta dough,” said Bello, founder and CEO of Vintage Italia. “We created Pasta Chips as a healthier alternative to the bland, overly processed options in the deli section, and we’re dedicated to finding new ways of offering our customers quality, gourmet taste and an elevated snack food product that has greater focus on nutrition.” Bello, who has co-founded branded food companies Sensible Portions, Brownie Brittle and Mamma Says, created the new Pasta Chip inspired by a traditional Italian dish – baked pasta dough drizzled with olive oil. After a trip to Italy, Bello came up with the concept of using actual fresh pasta pieces to convert into a salty snack line, Pasta Chips. “Since its introduction to the market in 2013, Pasta Chips has been setting a new standard for products in the better-for-you snack aisle,” said Tyler Mayoras, Principal at Advantage Capital. “Vintage Italia is changing the snack brand marketplace and proving that baked chips can be regionally inspired, healthful and tasty.” The Florida-based company had then, as it does now, a passion for using the same semolina flour, ancient grains and Italian herbs that have been celebrated for hundreds of years in Italy. The chips come in different seasonings based on favorite regional Italian sauces. “We created the Rural Business Investment Company as a way to inspire innovation and investment in rural America, and it is encouraging to see it doing just that,” said U.S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack. “Matching private investors with businesses in rural communities helps companies get the capital they need to grow and create jobs.” ACAP is a $154.5 million fund that is licensed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) as a Rural Business Investment Company (RBIC). The fund is a partnership between Advantage Capital and nine Farm Credit organizations, established to bring together resources and people focused on providing more private capital, small business investment and quality jobs to rural America. Farm Credit supports rural communities and agriculture with reliable, consistent access to credit and financial services.

Published on October 25, 2016. A row of product ads appear on Walmart.com. Credit: Walmart Most Popular Look under the hood of most major retail websites and you might think you're looking at the back end of a top tier publisher. E-commerce sites seem to be doubling down on ad tech, as large retailers look to capture more data on shoppers who visit, especially those that don't make a purchase at checkout. But are retailers overlooking the lessons that publishers learned doing the same thing? Many news and entertainment websites spent the past few years larding on ad tech to improve their targeting and tracking capabilities, only to slow down their sites and spur the adoption of ad-blocking software. "I think you can look at the retail sector as the latest version of the publishing community to go through this challenge," said Chris Copeland, president at Yieldbot. "Retailers run the exact same risks as the rest of the publishing community, which is they sacrifice latency and speed in an attempt to better monetize." "The challenge they are now getting into is one the core publishing industry went through the last two or three years, which is, 'What am I doing to speed? What am I doing to user experience?'" he added. Many large retailers are successfully generating ad revenue from marketers eager to reach their visitors, who are reasonably considered to be in a shopping frame of mind. The growth of the ad business on retail sites was spotlighted with two acquisition deals this month, just nine days apart: HookLogic's sale to Criteo and Triad Retail Media's sale to the WPP unit Xaxis. HookLogic and Triad are both in the business of serving display ads on the websites of mega retailers including Walmart, eBay, Sam's Club and Staples. "Triad and HookLogic created a business with what retailers had that wasn't a business already," said Jon Bond, founder of marketing consultancy company Tomorrow. "Retailers like the idea of selling digital ads because it's a lot like what they already do non-digitally, which is to try and take as much money from vendors as they already can through slotting fees and co-op. This is almost another version of that." The number of ad tags on the desktop website of Kohl's when viewing a couch (top) and The New York Times when reading an article about the election (bottom). Credit: Ghostery Retailers are even beginning to follow publishers into using header bidding, a programmatic technology that often leads to increased revenue by calling for bids on ad inventory from all comers at once rather in a sequence that stops at the first decent offer. "I would say retailers weren't the early adopters of header bidding, but they are starting to now," said Andrew Casale, president and CEO of Index Exchange. Index Exchange has about six retailers using its header bidding product including eBay, he said, adding that it's in "talks or mid-integration with dozens more." But unlike slotting fees to shelve certain products, ad tech can drive up website page load times, driving away impatient shoppers. Some retailers are seeking help bringing order to the tangle of code now running on their sites. "We do business with a lot of retailers specifically on this issue," said Scott Meyer, CEO of Ghostery, whose services include fighting latency for websites by evaluating each of their ad tech partners. "It's almost like retailers actually have the same problems as publishers. Performance matters a lot. The more stuff you add to a site, the slower it gets. And in retail, more so than publishing, the speed of the experience matters more than anything else." Ghostery's retail clients have doubled in the past year, according to Mr. Meyer, who said it works with 12 of the top 25 retailers and half of the top travel brands. Publishers generally still employ more ad tech than retailers, but the gap may be closing. In an unscientific test, Ad Age used Ghostery tech to capture the number of JavaScript tags in play when viewing a couch on the desktop version of Kohls.com and when reading an election article on The New York Times' desktop site. The results: Kohl's made 269 calls compared with 325 on NYTimes.com. Some tags handle tasks such as measurement, but most are more directly ad-related. E-commerce players have also begun dabbling in efforts such as Accelerated Mobile Pages, which loads mobile web pages near instantaneously by running very few tags, for certain areas of their sites. 1-800-Flowers' Celebration Passport, which is roughly equivalent to Amazon's subscription free-shipping service Prime, lands on an AMP page so users aren't crippled by slow load speeds when learning about the product or checking out. The company's philosophy on speed was cemented when it added Apple Pay to its mobile checkout: Sales for those items increased 14%, a person familiar with the move told Ad Age. AMP itself has plans to incorporate mobile payment options like Apple Pay into its infrastructure in the near future.

How Amazon counterfeits put this man's business on brink of collapse CNBC 10/25/2016 Ari Levy Click to expand Replay Video Bond market reels over $1 trillion loss from 'Trump thump' Donald Trump's shocking victory for the White House may end the more than 30-year-old bull run in bonds. According to Reuters, that's because bets on faster U.S. growth and inflation are leading investors to favor stocks over bonds. A two-day thumping wiped out more than $1 trillion across global bond markets worldwide, on bets that plans under a Trump administration would boost business investments and spending while firing up inflation. It was the worst rout in nearly 1-1/2 years.

The chance for a small manufacturing business to reach 4.5 million viewers for free doesn't come around often. Quotes in the article Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▼ 719.07 -19.94 -2.70% The Home Depot Inc HD ▼ 127.67 -2.18 -1.68% Nike Inc NKE ▼ 50.21 -0.56 -1.10% Target Corp TGT ▲ 72.17 +0.82 +1.15% Lopreiato appeared on "Buy it and Try It," a segment for hosts to test out popular niche gizmos from infomercials in front of an enthusiastic New York studio audience. The first product they tried was a steel nonstick pan, which smoothly cooked up eggs without the use of oil or butter. Then it was Forearm Forklift's turn. After viewing a commercial for the product, ABC's Lara Spencer and Gio Benitez pulled the heavy-duty moving straps over their forearms and proceeded to lift up a washing machine and walk with it. "I was pretty impressed," Spencer said to the crowd. You'd think such a shoutout from the hugely popular morning show would provide a huge boost for Lopreiato's 18-year-old family business. But this is Amazon.com's (AMZN) world, and Forearm Forklift, like so many brands, is uncomfortably inhabiting it.© Provided by CNBC Once a thriving product for movers and contractors available at a dozen big-box retailers including Wal-Mart (WMT), Target (TGT) and AutoZone (AZO), Forearm Forklift has been ravaged over the past half-decade by counterfeiters, mostly selling on Amazon. Scores of merchants have copied the patented product, using its name, images and labels and undercutting the real Forearm Forklift on price. When "Good Morning America" viewers go online to buy a set, which retails between $20 and $25, odds are they'll be purchasing someone else's product. "It just keeps funneling business to the knockoffs," said Lopreiato, 48, whose wife Sophia also works at the company and traveled with him to New York. "It's almost like winning the lottery if they choose our item." Forearm Forklift is hanging on by a thread. The company is down to 21 full-time employees from 52 at its peak and recorded less than $500 in profit last year. Annual revenue in 2008 topped $4 million and has since plunged 30 percent. Retailers stopped placing orders because they were finding what appeared to be the same thing online for much cheaper. Lopreiato has diversified his product line, adding a harness for the shoulders, a strap that goes over a single shoulder and straps for carrying boxes. But nothing has come close to replicating the success of his flagship Forearm Forklift. Meanwhile, Lopreiato bears the costs of workers' compensation, product quality control, commercial insurance, mortgage payments and patent management fees all so counterfeiters can act as freeloaders.© Provided by CNBC "We're competing with people who are stealing our brand, stealing our pictures and stealing our intellectual property," Lopreiato said in an interview last week from his 20,000-square foot warehouse in Baldwin Park, about 20 miles east of Los Angeles. Amazon's growing dominance in commerce brings with it plenty of collateral damage. The counterfeit problem, in particular, goes largely undiscussed by CEO Jeff Bezos and ignored by investors and analysts. The stock has climbed 37 percent over the last 12 months making Amazon the world's fourth-most valuable company, and 89 percent of analysts tracked by FactSet say shareholders should buy more. Heading into the Seattle-based company's third-quarter earnings report Thursday, investor focus is on Amazon Web Services, Prime membership growth and additional investments in supply chain and fulfillment. Analysts at Pacific Crest Securities, in their earnings preview, called Amazon "one of the most disruptive forces in retail and technology today." Conversations with merchants elicit a very different reaction. Since CNBC.com began reporting on Amazon's budding counterfeit issue in May, we've spoken with dozens of merchants that have narratives similar to Lopreiato's, but very few are willing to speak on the record out of fear of retribution from Amazon. Lopreiato, an Army veteran and father of two middle-school daughters, said he felt compelled to tell his story. "If Jeff Bezos knew exactly what was happening to us, he'd do the right thing," he said. "It's not that he's a bad guy. It's that there is, in my opinion, a lot of pressure put on folks at Amazon to increase sales, increase sales, increase sales. That's wonderful. That's the American way. But do it right." Amazon's obsessive focus on pleasing consumers with discounts and service has come at the expense of brands like Forearm Forklift. In trying to provide the lowest-cost option for virtually every product on the planet, the company opened the doors to merchants from across the globe with little respect for intellectual property, despite an anti-counterfeiting policy that prohibits the sale of inauthentic items. That's enabled manufacturers largely from China to take advantage of cheaper production and labor costs to compete on the Amazon market. Some big brands have voiced their concerns. Birkenstock said in July that it's no longer authorizing sales on Amazon starting in 2017. Last week Apple (AAPL) sued a distributor named Mobile Star for selling counterfeit power adapters and charging cables on the site, claiming the products "pose an immediate threat to consumer safety." Amazon has taken steps to crack down of late by forcing new sellers of major brands like Nike (NKE), Hasbro (HAS) and Cuisinart to show invoices proving the items are legitimate and then pay a fee. Third-party sellers are getting suspended in droves for activity that Amazon deems suspicious or for complaints from buyers, sparking outrage from merchants who say they're being punished for Amazon's inability to control counterfeiting. "Amazon has zero tolerance for the sale of counterfeits," a company spokesperson said in an e-mailed statement. "We are working closely with manufacturers and brands to identify offenders, and removing fraudulent items from our catalog. We are also taking action and aggressively pursuing bad actors in this space." The company didn't offer a comment on Forearm Forklift's situation. Until now, Forearm Forklift has been forced to self-police the site and take action to get unauthorized listings removed. See an infringer? Send a cease-and-desist letter. Suspicious of a counterfeit? Buy it, and prove to Amazon through a formal complaint that the listing should be taken down. Repeat, repeat, repeat. And pray it works.© Provided by CNBC On the second floor of Forearm Forklift's warehouse, Lopreiato opens a closet filled floor-to-ceiling with cardboard boxes from Amazon purchases. Inside each, supposedly, is a version of his product. There's no subtlety. The packaging includes not only his name and label but images of his family members and co-workers moving washing machines, armoires and exercise equipment. Open a box and find orange straps that are either too thin, too short, have loose stitching or are made of entirely different and weaker material. Lopreiato said he's submitted more than 100 cease-and-desist letters to third-party sellers and takedown notices to Amazon. But go to Amazon today, and infringers are easy to spot. One listing for furniture moving straps contains an image that looks like a couple of seat belts. Among the attached photos is one of Mark's wife moving a mattress. In a July 2015 e-mail to Amazon's patent team, Marty Proops, an Amazon marketplace expert who previously worked with Forearm Forklift on its account, said he and Lopreiato had identified 53 separate sellers offering infringing products over the past year. Buyers who assume they're getting the real thing are dismayed when the product can't possibly help them move a 300-pound refrigerator. Thus, Forearm Forklift has one-star reviews from customers calling it a "cheap knockoff (don't purchase)" and "very obvious counterfeit." "That posts on our offer page on Amazon so a lot of people think we're offering fakes," Lopreiato said. He never expected this to be easy. He developed the original contraption while working as a mover and dealing with clients who didn't want dollies rolling across new wooden floors. Carrying items by hand meant bending down with 200-pound appliances to get through doorways. Lopreiato got started renting a small warehouse in 1998 and had so little money that he lived in the office. He had an evening gig at a law firm doing clerical work and waited tables on weekends. For 12 years, Lopreiato built the business by attending trade shows and networking with distributors and buyers. He forged deals with companies ranging from U-Haul and Home Depot (HD) to Ross Stores (ROST) and Canadian Tire (CTC.A-CA). He was on QVC every two months or so starting in 2003, selling more than 20,000 Forearm Forklifts per live show at the peak. He started selling to Amazon as a vendor that same year, but it was never a big part of his business, representing under 2 percent of revenue in 2008. Lopreiato was fully prepared for competition, knowing that patent protection only goes so far. But he never expected a counterfeiting onslaught. The slide started in 2010. He got a call from an Amazon employee, saying that other sellers were offering his product at a much lower price and he needed to cut his rate to keep the business. Lopreiato investigated and quickly found the rival products were fakes. He told Amazon that he would aggressively defend his intellectual property but that he couldn't compete with those prices and still make money. Amazon was unhappy with that response, and within weeks there were more than 100 knockoffs on the site, Lopreiato said. "Since that date, it's just been absolutely downhill," he said. Over the past six years, Lopreiato has seen vendor managers come and go without fixing the problem or notifying him that they're leaving. He forwarded a number of e-mails from the past two years, where he and Proops showed explicit infringement and asked for help. In addition to jeopardizing Forearm Forklift's business, Proops wrote in June 2015, "Sooner or later an Amazon customer is going to be seriously injured by one of these cheap knockoffs!" Responses ranged from terse to deflecting. Amazon told Proops to send complaints to generic e-mail addresses copyright@amazon.com and patents@amazon.com. Other e-mails suggested that the company was looking into the matter, but then the account would move to another representative. In July 2015, an Amazon lawyer told Proops by e-mail that Forearm Forklift should take up infringement matters directly with the third-party sellers. "At this time we consider this matter closed and we will take no further action," he wrote. C.J. Rosenbaum, a lawyer who represents Amazon sellers, said the rapid turnover in vendor managers and inconsistency in how they treat issues is a constant source of frustration. © Provided by CNBC "Amazon's responses are very erratic," said Rosenbaum, who recently published the "Amazon Law Library," a book compiling the legal issues surrounding the company and platform. "You can send in one complaint through the system about an IP violation and they take down the listing, and submit the same exact thing again and just fail." For Lopreiato, legal action presents an expensive option with little upside. Individually going after infringers, who he'd first have to track down, would require more time and money than he's got in the bank. He filed one case in 2013 against a domestic company and was awarded a settlement before trial. Taking on Amazon directly has been a non-starter for the three intellectual property lawyers Lopreiato has contacted. More than anything, he needs Amazon's help. With traditional retailers sinking fast and more retail and wholesale activity shifting to Amazon, Forearm Forklift now counts on the site for about 12 percent of revenue, a number that's growing despite the flood of counterfeits. A tiny number of additional orders rolled in after the "Good Morning America" appearance, even though Lopreiato is certain that far more went to the knockoffs. Similarly, a Facebook page called Impressive Things posted Forearm Forklift's commercial earlier this month, generating 909,000 views and counting. Again, more revenue for the fakes. On Friday morning, Lopreiato received a particularly discouraging call. Aafes, a retailer targeting military communities, had been planning to buy Forearm Forklift for 120 of its stores. The representative handling the deal was calling Lopreiato because an Aafes executive had discovered lookalikes on Amazon for a much lower price. He e-mailed a screenshot showing two different sellers using Forearm Forklift's photos (including the one below) to promote their products, one for $8.09 and the other for $11.24.  Lopreiato is all too familiar with this routine. He replied with a lengthy apology and offered assurance that the cheaper products are fakes. He gave his standard "buyer beware" pitch, explaining that the knockoffs are low-quality, unsafe and uninsured. He's not at all confident that it will be enough. In a text message on Friday afternoon, Lopreiato wrote, "Another prospect will probably be lost."

Freitekh was killed and his instructor, Prevalla was injured when the twin-engine Piper PA 34 they were in crashed on Main Street, near the Connecticut headquarters of military jet-engine maker Pratt & Whitney, and burst into flames. Justice Ginsburg Makes Opera Debut With Speaking Role The National Transportation Safety Board previously said the crash that killed Freitekh and seriously injured Prevalla appeared to have been the result of an intentional act. A senior law enforcement official familiar with the investigation told NBC News, Prevalla told investigators that Freitekh, a Jordanian national, was at the controls at the time of the crash. Some kind of argument or struggle for the controls ensued, the official said, and the plane crashed. The instructor did not know why it happened. Racist Texts Sent to Black U. Penn. Students; 3 Arrested Police searched Freitek's Hartford-area home but did not find anything to indicate any terrorist interests or sympathies, a senior federal official told NBC News' Pete Williams. He was also not on any terrorism watch list, the official added.

News Print   Email   Font Resize Lafayette Promenade development inches forward By Anthony Hahn Staff Writer Posted:   07/26/2016 10:04:54 PM MDT Lafayette's Planning Commission approved a site plan Tuesday night for the development of a 21,930-square-foot commercial development focusing on the sale of farm/ranch equipment and maintenance, animal feed and lawn and garden equipment — moving forward plans for a development that will come to compete with the hotly-contested Nine Mile Corner. In addition to the building, the site improvements include 31,748 square feet of landscaped area, 93 parking spaces, including longer pull-through spaces for trailers/RVs , a detention/water quality area on the south side of the lot and two access drives from the south connecting to Walmart and one from the future extension of Aspen Ridge Drive, according to official city documents. The vote, which comes only days after Lafayette filed a condemnation lawsuit against Erie, is one of the last steps in a year-long process to finalize plans for the large-scale development. Last month, Lafayette's Planning Commission approved the preliminary plan for Lafayette Promenade, a 30-acre commercial development located directly across the street from Nine Mile Corner and immediately north of the Walmart. Lindsay Gadd, a development coordinator for Hix Snedeker, said earlier this year that competition between communities is "fairly common." But during a community meeting for the project in March, Ray Hix, the firm's co-founder, described the tension as rising to the level of municipal "nuclear war." Advertisement "There are dark forces between cities that are competing for these retail sites," Hix said of Nine Mile Corner and Lafayette Promenade at the time.

Submitted logo "I think council and administration here really have their work cut out for them to get a capital budget that's going to work for all of the needs and still be realistic on costs." NORM MCINNIS, CAO Outgoing CAO Norm McInnis says council will have some tough calls to make as 2017 budget discussions continue. As it stands, council has been presented with a proposed $11-million draft capital budget, a "fairly ambitious" plan he says that still needs changes. The proposal would have a significant portion of next year's capital spending funded through borrowing -- $4.7 million of it. That would be more than the entire 2016 capital budget. "There's lots of very worthy projects involved," McInnis said. "I think council and administration here really have their work cut out for them to get a capital budget that's going to work for all of the needs and still be realistic on costs." An athletic park in the northwest near Walmart headlines the draft capital budget. McInnis said that includes new ball diamonds, soccer fields, a toboggan hill and outdoor BMX track. Before that development even starts, road and water infrastructure would need to be built. Total cost: about $4 million in debenture spending. Coun. Mary Jane Harper said she expects council to approve the project because of the town's dearth of playing spaces needed to accommodate the growth in soccer and ball enrolment. The minor soccer association has stated in the past that the town does not have the facilities to host district and provincial tournaments. Harper believes there would be economic benefits in being able to hold those types of events, which she says would fill hotel rooms and restaurants. "It would be a great economic impact being able to host all types of sporting events in our community as opposed to just hockey in the winter," she said. While not included in the 2017 capital budget, the town's operations centre is another big-ticket future expense that council will have to discuss. It is an $8-million facility that could house the town's vehicles and equipment, sand and salt for roads, materials for road repairs, pipes for the water system, garbage bins, and office space. Harper said the current building for town operations  the former fire hall on 50th Street  is not ideal. "It was old when it was given up as a fire hall. In order to meet the needs of the operations, (parks and recreation), they need a better building where everybody is together and all the equipment is in the same place as opposed to being spread out in different areas." That project is included in the town's 10-year capital plan, which is advisory in nature, used to guide council's decision-making by showing what projects are on the horizon. Chief financial officer Garth Lucas said council will have to balance fiscal reality with the needs of the community. "The proposed 10-year capital plan has a large number of capital expenditures that are going to have an impact on future budgets," he said. "Are those proposed budgets in the best interests of the town?" OPERATING BUDGET Council and administration are trying to work toward an operating budget that would not require an increase to the tax rate come April, when rates are set. "I'm very cognizant of the fact that our citizens -- the entire province -- is in an economic downturn and we cannot inflict any more extra costs onto our citizens. We just can't do that," Harper said, citing the provincial carbon tax coming into effect next year. Administration has already reduced the operating deficit to about $297,000, she said. Lucas said a zero per cent increase might not be possible. But message received  don't pile on taxpayers. "The budget is still under discussion and it's council's desire to have definitely a minimal tax increase, zero per cent if possible," he said. He adds that an open house regarding the budgets will be held on Dec. 5 at the town office, at 7 p.m. jho@olds.greatwest.ca Previous Story Next Story From Around The Province Wave of warm weather welcome in November Saturday Nov 12, 2016 St. Albert Gazette The weather in the capital region has been unseasonably warm in November, breaking several temperature records.

Senate Candidates Handle Slew of Questions During Debate At BCC By Andy McKeeveriBerkshires Staff 12:29AM / Tuesday, October 25, 2016Print | Email PITTSFIELD, Mass. — Most of the questions at Monday's state Senate debate were on the ballot questions, with each of the two candidates taking slightly different views on them. Republican Christine Canning-Wilson and Democrat Adam Hinds are both seeking election to the state Senate seat being vacated by Benjamin Downing. The two faced off at a debate Monday night sponsored by the Pittsfield Gazette and Berkshire Community College and moderator Dan Dillon said while the ballot questions are going to voters, the candidate's answers do reflect where they stand on hot topics in the state. He started off with the question of expanding charter schools. The ballot question would allow for a dozen more to open in the state. Canning-Wilson said she was "neutral" on the topic while Hinds opposes the expansion.  "Charter schools would be fabulous in the eastern part of the state," Canning-Wilson said. The longtime educator and administrator says in the Level 4 or 5 school districts, charter schools open an opportunity for parents. But in the Berkshires region, where there are no schools at those levels, she said the funding of charter schools poses a challenge to local districts, districts that can't deny certain children enrollment or expel students. "Public schools don't have the option of who they get, charter schools can pick in choose in some instances," she said. Canning-Wilson said traditional public school districts need to have the funding to put toward special education, which is mandated. Hinds, on leave as director of the Northern Berkshire Community Coalition, said before even thinking about more charter schools, the Chapter 70 foundation formula needs to be sorted out.   "We need to make sure our public schools are as strong as they can be," Hinds said. "We need to get the financing part right before we talk about expanding more charter schools." He added, "There is no way we can take ourselves seriously if we don't have the best schools around" and that he already convened a group of educators to discuss how to change the foundation funding formula and fix the funding shortfalls in the public schools. The two did have a disagreement over whether or not it was Chapter 70 or Chapter 71 that is the foundation formula with Canning-Wilson saying 70 was for regional school transportation and Hinds saying transportation was 71. Hinds was correct in that argument. But nonetheless, they both voiced similar concerns. A followup on that was whether St. Joseph Central High School, which the Diocese of Springfield just announced will close at the end of the school year, could be a charter school. Hinds said there do not seem to be people "clamoring for another charter school" so he doesn't expect that to be much of a threat. But, the closure does mean another vacant downtown building that will need to be addressed. "The reality is the diocese should have been more transparent," Hinds said of the pending closure. Canning is a St. Joe graduate and has joined in the movement to try to keep it open. She, too, doesn't think the building is fit for a charter school because of needed capital repairs. The closure, however, has a number of impacts on the city from the loss of 24 jobs to 68 students looking for faith-based education. Meanwhile, "they are building a $50 million plus Catholic school in Springfield" that is likely too far for local families to travel for faith-based education. She believes the way the closure was announced was "unfair to families." On the question of legalizing marijuana for recreational use, Hinds took a more moderate stance while Canning-Wilson definitively supported passing it. Canning-Wilson, who exhumed plenty of laughs and chuckles throughout the night with her quick wit and humor, said "long live Cheech and Chong" and her eyes lit up with possibilities for economic growth with the legalization. She said the Berkshires and the state should go right after the hemp market, growing it, selling it, and making products with it. She said hemp can be used in many, many products and that will create jobs, business growth, and tax revenue. "My opinion on this is that we take it and tax it because people are more ready to buy the clean stuff than the dirty stuff on the street," Canning-Wilson said. She countered the arguments that it would enhance a drug problem saying, "The amount of people who actually use marijuana are people who are 45 years old and up. The new generation doesn't want it, they are into synthetic drugs." Hinds said, "I have no problem with adult use of marijuana" and that he had supported medical marijuana and the decriminalization of it, saying the "war on drugs has been a failure." But, he is also working with the community coalition on preventing substance abuse among the youth, which gives him pause. He doesn't want marijuana to have an impact on developing brains and vowed that if elected, he'd work with the other legislators to put in restrictions to prevent it from getting into the hands of youth. Further, he said there is also a lot to do when it comes to making sure authorities can test for driving while under the influence of marijuana as well as concerns with the money flow since the federal government still has laws against it. Much of Colorado's legal pot industry is handled in cash, for instance. Dillon questioned the tax revenue, saying casinos haven't yet brought in the expected boon that proponents had been expecting. Both candidates expressed concern about gambling in the state as well, particularly with gambling addiction. "The odds are rigged against you," Canning-Wilson said. She said with casinos there comes problems such as sex trafficking and other problems. She doesn't want to see that element locally — though she suspects a casino may be wanting to come here — and would fight to ensure there is proper oversight and prevention of any negative consequences. Hinds said that while adults should have the ability to make the decisions on how they want to spend their money, "there is a lot of folks who have problems with gambling." He said any casino proposal would need to be looked at on a case-by-case basis. Another ballot question is that of treatment of farm animals. The question sets certain restrictions on how animals being raised for food are treated — such as allowing a cow to have a stall large enough so that it can turn around. "Having a human perspective of animal treatment is an important part of who we are," Hinds said, fully supportive of the law. Hinds said only one farm in the entire state would be impacted by the laws. Canning-Wilson also supports humane treatment of animals. She added that oftentimes travel for animals going to slaughter leads to cramped cages. She said the Berkshires could benefit from a slaughterhouse with quick and painless deaths of the animals being raised for food. That would help the local farmers as well. The local question of adopting the Community Preservation Act is also on the ballot. That would put a 1 percent surcharge on tax bills above the first $100,000 value and be put to use for historic preservation, conservation and open space, recreation, and affordable housing. "I think it is an important part of preserving some of our aging buildings," Hinds said. "It creates a balance and allows us to be reasonable about how we spend out money." Canning-Wilson said that is a Pittsfield question but used the opportunity to call for more transparent funding in the city. She wants to make sure spending is being allocated right way. "This is something Pittsfield must decide on itself and I would love to see more money pumped into the parks," she said. She dovetailed into discussing state subsidies and tax breaks on farm land being used to grow certain crops. She said when a farmer dies, only one child can inherit that land. She hopes to change that so it doesn't break families apart. Another local issue is the proposed Walmart Supercenter being eyed for the William Stanley Business Park. Canning-Wilson said she has many concerns about it from the level of cleanup of the property proposed to the actual wages and benefits of the workers. She said Walmart employees nationwide are receiving some $6 billion in taxpayer assistance, whether it be for health care or food assistance. "A lot of people don't get enough hours so they don't get their health insurance," she said. Hinds said he, too, has concerns about Walmart but at the same time, there may be benefits for the city of Pittsfield. He said he'd be there to assist in whatever the city needs. "I personally, in general, don't support Walmart as an economic development tool," he said. That being said, "we've gone so many years without investment and what are we going to do with it?" For economic development, Hinds said, "we need to get the fundamentals right." That means making investments in the small and medium-sized businesses, improving workforce training, making sure the county has the best schools possible and reducing energy costs. "A lot of businesses are struggling under the weight of energy and at the same time the state is behind its goal of reducing carbon emissions," Hinds said, saying he wants a comprehensive plan in place that will allow business owners to know where the state is going over a number of years to increase renewables and reduce costs. When it comes to schools, he said the county is losing the 20-30 age bracket and those are the young families who will be looking for the best schools. If the county wants to retain that group, the schools need to be the best. Canning-Wilson's economic development philosophy focuses on taxes. She is calling for an elimination of state taxes to help attract businesses. That is particularly important in the Berkshires where businesses can opt to go just over the border into New York and operate for 10 years tax free. "We can promise you jobs and float these ideas out like they've been doing for 24 years, but the problem is our tax system," she said. "We need to lower our taxes so we can increase small business. We know, and you know, small business attracts jobs." She also is calling for the elimination of the state tax on estates, so when a someone dies the family gets the money. To compensate for any loss of revenue with tax reductions, she is calling for stricter oversight of various state programs to reduce fraud in the system. Canning-Wilson also attempted to separate herself from party affiliations. "I am not Donald Trump. I have very little in common with Donald Trump," she said of her party's presidential candidate. She said she is the byproduct of a liberal father and conservative mother. Her loyalty isn't to a political party but to the people. She got into the race because she "saw corruption, nepotism" while the district wasn't seeing progress. "I am going to be there for you, I always have been and will always be," Canning-Wilson said. Hinds got into the race because "I don't want to do politics as normal. I don't want to get into the bitter, negative approach we see on the national level." Instead he wants to inspire others to craft and fulfill an agenda that will help the district. He said his grandfather moved from England at the age of 17 and took his first job sweeping floors for his local Boys Club of American. And 55 years later, he retired as the national president. But now, "it's not easy to rest assured in the idea that if you work hard, keep your head down, and follow the rules and you'll be secure," Hinds said. And that's what he wants to bring to the seat. Early voting has begun for the first time in Massachusetts with polls open during business hours and limited times this Saturday at city and town hall. The election is on Tuesday, Nov. 8. 1 Comments Your Comments iBerkshires.com welcomes critical, respectful dialogue. Name-calling, personal attacks, libel, slander or foul language is not allowed.

Gracey Evans/Post-Gazette The inside of Pork & Beans. By Dan Gigler / Pittsburgh Post-Gazette After months sitting in park like a restored Chevy Big Block pickup in an old shed, Pork & Beans is ready to roar to life today on Sixth Street, bringing Texas-style barbecue in a rollicking roadhouse setting to Downtown. The much-anticipated restaurant is the fourth in the Golden Triangle by chef Richard DeShantz and his partnership, the DeShantz Restaurant Group, and the third on the same two-block stretch. The others — Meat & Potatoes, Butcher and the Rye, and Tako — have become synonymous with the resurrection of Downtown as a dining and drinking destination and with an overall elevated citywide restaurant scene. Keith Fuller, who opened nearby Six Penn and the acclaimed former Root 174 in Regent Square, is Mr. DeShantz’s culinary co-pilot in the endeavor, along with James Ciminillo, who has worked with Mr. DeShantz for nine years and most recently ran the kitchen at sister establishment Meat & Potatoes on Penn Avenue. As is the case at other DeShantz restaurants, expect the menu to be a mingling of high society and friends in low places. For instance: fried chicken with a Trenton pork roll, foie gras terrine, pepper jack cheese and a truffle aioli. Drinks, by bar managers Michael R. Anderson and Riley Snyder, will also have a Waldorf meets Wal-Mart quality, as evidenced by the Green Chartreuse and Mountain Dew slushy. And, naturally there will be meat — a lot of it. “I haven’t eaten so much smoked meat in my life,” Mr. Fuller said, as he and Mr. Ciminillo have worked for months to perfect what he said is the 14-hour process for pork belly, ribs and brisket. Mr. DeShantz has as much hand in the look as the menu, and the decor is, as Mr. Fuller said with a bellowing laugh, “Like the fanciest Cracker Barrel you’ve ever seen.” Indeed. There are frosted globe pendant lights but also bulbs covered with Mason jars. A century-old wooden icebox has been restored to working order and holds both bombers of craft beer and 40’s of malt liquor, and it sits amid cords of firewood on metal shelves for use in the smoking process. There’s an old VFW sign and a replica of the neon sign from the raunchy 1981 comedy “Porky’s.” A wall of beer cans is fashioned into a pig’s head. The bar back is of subway tile and sleek piping, the drains for the 36 taps are antique porcelain wash basins. A vintage Coke machine holds wine. “I want somewhere that people feel comfortable and are going to have a really good time,” Mr. DeShantz said. “Decor, service, food — we try to hit every note. I want it to be fun and for people to enjoy themselves. There’s something for everyone here.” Plans for the restaurant were announced in 2015 with an original anticipated opening around Memorial Day 2016, which was bumped a few times due to permit issues. “We had an issue with our putting our smoker in,” Mr. DeShantz said, conceding that it’s hard to have a barbecue restaurant without one. “There’s a lot of other new restaurants opening up, too, and so the process is a long one. It’s not like, ‘Hey, fix this,’ and you fix it, and the next day they come back. It’s more like, ‘Hey, fix this, and I’ll see you in two months,’ ” Mr. DeShantz explained. “When you’re building things, obstacles come up. We want to do everything by the book so we don’t have any issues down the road. The city wants to make sure everything is done right, too.” The unanticipated extra downtime ended up being a plus, both personally and professionally, as they were able to spend time with family and take vacations but also were able to fine tune the restaurant and build anticipation for its opening. That said, they are more than ready for Pork & Beans to open. Plus, as Mr. Fuller quipped, “I haven’t had a paycheck since May,” referencing the closure of Root 174. For Mr. DeShantz, a city native who grew up modestly in Sheraden, it’s been quite a journey that’s taken him from Justine Street to the king of Downtown dining, with more on the way — next year a sushi spot is planned to go in next to Butcher and the Rye. “I’m pretty humbled by where I’ve come from and what I’ve accomplished … when you step back a little bit, it’s like ‘Wow,’ ” he said. “The past few years have been really good to me. But I don’t think with money. I think with passion. My success is based on how many people I make happy and how many lives I can change [through employment] and do good things for the city.” Pork & Beans: 136 Sixth St., Downtown; 412-338-1876; porkandbeanspgh.com.

Skip to main content Apple Valley Review Main menu Home Arrest Logs Classifieds Community Events Contact Us Opinion Roy's 100th You are here Home Tips for carving up the perfect pumpkin October 24, 2016 By L.J. Gambone For the Apple Valley Review As summer slips away, we’re reminded that the time-honored tradition of Halloween is right around the corner. That means kids everywhere, and even adults, will be looking for the perfect pumpkin to carve. For more than 60 years, the Ocala, Florida-based company Pumpkin Masters has been selling its Pumpkin Carving Kits, which make it easy to create scary, silly or any other kind of pumpkin design one can dream up. Each kit contains saws, scraper scoops, crayons, pokers and a pattern book that offers designs from easy to advanced. Along with its pumpkin kits, Pumpkin Masters also makes a variety of stand-alone tools, as well as pumpkin lights and other useful accessories. Products can be purchased at Wal-Mart and Amazon starting at around $7.99. “Pumpkin Masters carving kits are easy to use and allow anyone — from beginners to seasoned carvers — to create a pumpkin to be proud of,” said Jenn Falik, lifestyle blogger and Pumpkin Masters spokesperson. “I love that these kits allow you to be artistic and craft a beautiful pumpkin in a very little amount of time.” Falik offered the following tips on how to pick out and carve your perfect pumpkin. When picking out your pumpkin: • Medium pumpkins are best for carving. • Consider the carving pattern/design you would like before selecting the pumpkin. Is the design or pattern wide or tall? This will help you choose the best shaped pumpkin. • Look for one that’s completely orange; partially green pumpkins may not ripen any further. • Check for cracks or splits and a flat bottom so it won’t roll. Getting your pumpkin ready to carve: • A lot of people cut out the top of the pumpkin, near the stem, but it is actually better to cut a circle out of the bottom of the pumpkin so it can easily be placed directly on top of your light source. It also allows more surface area for carving your design. • Scoop out all the pulp. Pumpkin Masters carving kits have all the tools to make your pumpkin carving process quick and easy. The scooping tool included in each kit makes it a cinch to dig out all that pumpkin mush and seeds. How to pull off a masterfully-carved pumpkin: • One of the easiest ways is to buy a pumpkin carving kit. The best part about Pumpkin Masters carving kits is that no prior carving experience is needed as all the necessary tools to avoid a pumpkin disaster and become a pumpkin master are provided in one convenient package. • Along with the easy-to-use, durable tools, each kit includes a wide variety of designs options, offering everything from spooky to silly to simply stunning. • Pumpkin Masters’ pattern transfer method makes it easy to achieve a great-looking pumpkin. Each design has a mastery level rating so you can decide which is best for you. The design booklet also includes visual step-by-step carving instructions making it even easier to create a true work-of-art. For more information, visit www.pumpkinmasters.com.

Posted By: Sunil Fernandes Updated: Sunday, November 6, 2016, 6:14 [IST] Subscribe to GoodReturns Markets have gone nowhere in the last few weeks, as investors continue to look at quality stocks. However, there are certain section of investors who look at stocks and do not buy the same, if the price is really high. We have therefore selected a few stocks, that are priced near Rs 50 or under Rs 50 and can be good buys, if you have more of a long term perspective in mind. Here are a few stocks that can give decent returns over the more long-term. Understanding the risk element It is important to remember that there is an element of risk, in buying stocks that are valued at such low levels of Rs 50 and below. However, sometimes that can be of face value that is not of Rs 10. For example, in the first stock we have mentioned the face value of Welspun India is just Re 1. So, it is also important to look at the face value before investing in the stock. This is a world class textile manufacturer Make no mistake, Welspun India is very big. In fact, the company is the third largest home textiles company globally. The company supplies its products like terry towels and bedsheets, to some of the top global companies in the world, including the likes of Walmart, J C Penney, Macy's etc. In fact, the company was ranked as the no 1 in "Top 15 Home Textile Supplier Giants to USA" by Home Textiles & Today Magazine. The company is heavily into exports and exports 97 per cent of its products. Welspun India has a presence in almost 50 countries around the world.   Shares have crashed Shares in Welspun India have crashed from levels of Rs 104 to the current market price of Rs 55. The stock is currently trading at Rs 55. The crash in the stock, was largely after Target Corporation of the US severed ties with the company for supplying bedsheets that did not have Egyptian cotton. Target Corporation felt that Welspun India had used cheaper variants of cotton. That led to a crash in the stock price and you are now getting it at half the price. Now, apart from Target, no other big chain has really severed its tie with the company. According to rough estimates, the company could lose around 10 per cent of its total business, due to Target severing its ties. Welspun India has now appointed Ernst & Young to look into alleged lapses in its products supply after the Target Corp episode.  The company has appointed Ernst & Young LLP to review its full supply chain systems and processes,"   Fundamentally sound We believe that Welspun India has taken corrective measures, to check the lapse that happened with Target. The appointment of an external auditor was a step in the right direction. However, we do believe that the company is very strong fundamentally and the current valuations for a world-class manufacturer are not bad. For the quarter ending June 30, 2016 the company reported an EPS of Rs 1.81. Even if it reports an EPS of Rs 7 for the FY 2016-17, the company is trading at just 8 times, one year forward p/e. We have also factored in the loss of business that the company would face due to Target Corporation severing ties with the company. The stock is not a bad bet at the current levels of near 50, if one were to have a long-term perspective in mind. Syndicate Bank It is always a surprise when one recommends a government owned bank. However, we believe that Syndicate Bank has the potential to generate returns over the more long and medium term. There are a number of reasons that we believe we might see positive momentum in some of the government owned banks. The first is that these set of banks have come a long way in terms of cleaning-up the NPA mess, though it still is a little bit messy. At some stage in the next few years, we believe that economic recovery will gather momentum and with it an improvement in the NPAs. The bank has had a better performance when compared to most other PSU banks. Financials For the quarter ending June 30, 2016, Syndicate Bank reported a net profit of Rs 77 crores, as against a loss in the previous quarter. The bank's capital adequacy ratio at 11.48 per cent, was also not bad. Yes, gross non performing assets did rise from 6.70 per cent to 7.53 per cent, but, we believe that going ahead this might improve. However, we do think it might take another 3-4 quarters, before we some really significant recovery in the NPAs.   Share price movement This is when you are unlikely to get the stock at the current market price of Rs 77. If you are a long term investor, the stock is a good stock under Rs 100 to buy. Syndicate Bank had hit a 52-week high of just Rs 83 recently.     Disclaimer The article is not a solicitation to buy, sell in securities or other financial instruments.

(Published Monday, Oct. 24, 2016) The only gay nightclub in Portland, Maine, is closing. The owner calls it a bittersweet sign of the times. "We don't have the crowd we used to," said Joshua Moody, who has owned Styxx for 12 years. PBS News Anchor Gwen Ifill Dies at 61 After Cancer Battle It's in line with a nationwide trend: as more members of the gay community branch out and feel welcomed and accepted in all kinds of bars and clubs, the traditional places lose business. "We never really got the younger gay generation that needs the gay club as much as the older one did," said Moody. Vouching for Trump, Obama Says US Will Maintain Alliances Styxx will close in January after decades in downtown Portland. "It's sad," said longtime patron and part-time DJ, Chris O'Connor. Priebus Says He and Bannon Make Effective Team Amid Backlash When he moved to Maine 18 years ago, O'Connor found a home at the nightclub. He said he has noticed a decline in business at the bar, but was still hit hard when the owner announced the closure. "We actually sat around and cried," said O'Connor. "It's been a part of our lives for so long." Justice Ginsburg Makes Opera Debut With Speaking Role Longtime gay bars in New York, San Francisco, and Los Angeles have been closing.

Back To Top[*] The price of doing business Oct. 25, 2016 - 05:57AM JST The U.S. election is drawing near and pundits are turning their attention to the positions candidates might take on less-discussed topics. In my world, that includes international corruption and the candidates have, overtime, championed very different positions. In 2012, shortly after the WalMart bribery scandal broke, Donald Trump said that the U.S. anti-bribery law is a “horrible law”.  It “puts the U.S. at a huge disadvantage” because “every other country is doing it and we’re not allowed to.” This is not an original argument. Then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, also in 2012, said that corruption “eats away … at the potential for broad-based, sustainable, inclusive growth.” She added that “corruption stifles entrepreneurship.” Her position reflected President Barack Obama’s, and each of his predecessors back to President Jimmy Carter, in support of the United States’ anti-bribery law, the 1977 Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. There is no question that a well-timed bribe can sometimes win a contract that might otherwise be lost. As such, it’s easy to conclude that bribery, at its most basic, is good for business. The full picture, however, is a bit more subtle. Trump’s argument misses the very real concern that bribery is expensive. It’s not just the expense of the bribe itself, it’s the expense introduced when a company makes it clear that they’re prepared to negotiate outside the terms of the contract. Suddenly, everything is negotiable and the bribe taker wants to be paid for interim approvals, for follow-on work, for final approval and, ultimately, for releasing funds for payment. The written contract is quickly subordinated to the bribe-based relationship, which can introduce expense that renders the contract unprofitable. Related to expense is the cost of delay. As each new milestone brings a new clandestine negotiation of corrupt terms, time is lost: management time, employee time and very often the time of equipment that sits unused while negotiations drag on. In a rush? Prepare to pay much more. Trump’s argument does not account for reputational damage, which carries a real financial cost. The companies that pay bribes in foreign markets are very often known within the local community. These companies are seen to demand more and deliver less, all with the apparent approval of local government officials. It doesn’t take long to connect the dots and corrupt companies find it harder to recruit talent within these markets. Given a choice, the strongest candidates will gravitate to companies of which they can feel proud. Companies also risk the wrath of successor governments keen to be seen chucking out those who paid bribes to the previous administration. These costs, like Clinton’s “stifled entrepreneurship,” are difficult to quantify. In a global market, there may be a simpler case to be made that bribery is bad for business. Imagine an executive traveling aboard with his sales team to expand his company’s footprint. Before he sits down at the table for the first time, he and his colleagues have run a bribery gauntlet.  Depending on the part of the world they’re in, they may have flown on planes that relied on air traffic control systems bought based on the highest bribes, not the highest standards. They’ve probably passed through airports where customs officials routinely accept bribes to avert their eyes while unsafe food products or tainted pharmaceutical products are introduced into the local market. They may have stayed in hotels for which the local inspectors have agreed to overlook health and safety violations in exchange for ridiculously small sums. The police may demand a modest bribe to protect the corporate team if there is unrest in the streets. Of course, having sold their professional integrity once, the team shouldn’t imagine the police won’t sell it a second time to a higher bidder. Bribery makes the world less predictable, less safe, less lawful and less fair. It introduces uncertainty into contracts and delay into execution. The greatest effect is felt overseas, but when the best product doesn’t sell at a fair price because bribery has distorted the market, the consequences follow companies home. That just can’t be good for business, whatever your politics. Back To Top[*] Switch to full browser version © 2016 GPlusMedia

The Provo Daily Herald reports employees gave mother Cecelia Rivas baby clothes, a stroller, a car seat and plenty of diapers for her son Matias on Wednesday. Store manager Dustin Haight says the mother and baby are like family now. Rivas says she'd felt labor pains early the morning of Oct. 9 and went to the store for a few things before going to the hospital, but when her water broke in line she knew she was going to give birth in the store. She says she was surprised and scared, but things went well and her third child is now at home. + Leave a comment Like that? Read this.

According to the New Hanover County District Attorney’s Office, Akeem Tindall, 27, pleaded guilty to sell/deliver heroin, possession with intent to sell and deliver heroin, and fleeing to elude arrest. He was sentenced to 50 to 72 months. On Dec. 29, 2015, a confidential informant told detectives with the New Hanover County Sheriff’s Office that Tindall was selling heroin. The informant also said he had purchased heroin from Tindall in the past, generally meeting in Tindall’s car at the Walmart on Sigmon Road. Under the detectives’ surveillance, the informant made a recorded phone call to Tindall setting up a purchase of 10 bags of heroin for $120. The two then met in the Walmart parking lot where the transaction occurred in Tindall’s car. On Jan. 12, 2016, detectives set up another controlled purchase with Tindall of 50 bags of heroin for $500. When Tindall was on the way to meet with the informant, detectives attempted to pull him over, but he refused to stop. Tindall led detectives on a chase, swerving between three lanes of travel on South College Road and driving through a parking lot. Ultimately, Tindall hit a trailer attached to a vehicle after running a stop sign. He had 40 bags of heroin in his possession. Tindall had multiple felony drug and firearm convictions in the past, which elevated his status to a habitual felon. Copyright 2016 WECT. All rights reserved.

Henry Co. YMCA benefits from land donation DARREL RADFORD 2:45 p.m. EDT October 24, 2016 YMCA logo. (Photo: Provided) CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Wayne Nelson remembers how skepticism greeted him when he first proposed an apartment complex in New Castle nearly 45 years ago. One man believed in him then and convinced fellow bank board members to back his project. Because of Donald C. “Danny” Danielson’s faith in him, not only did Nelson build Jamestown Village Apartments, he continued to build, own and manage another 6,000 units in the Indianapolis metropolitan area. In fact, three of the properties, including Jamestown Village, sold in 2006 for $37.45 million. The ripple effect of Nelson’s success also created the Wayne and Marilyn Nelson Foundation based in Florida, which has enhanced the education of young people through charter school scholarships. It all started with Danielson’s faith in a friend. A philanthropic force on behalf of Ivy Tech in New Castle as well as Indiana University in New Castle, Richmond, Bloomington and across the state, Danielson is gone now, having died May 7, 2015, but Nelson is making sure his friend is not forgotten. Nelson is donating a 20-acre tract to the Henry County YMCA. The land is located between the Jamestown Village Apartment and Wal-Mart in a prime real estate area along Ind. 3 in New Castle. Proceeds from that sale will be used to help bring long-lasting stability to the Henry County YMCA that Danielson dearly loved. “It’s one of the best causes in the community and we’re glad to be a part of it,” Nelson said of his donation. “Marilyn and I wish the very best for the YMCA as they minister to the young and old coming through their doors.” Danielson had been working with Nelson on the arrangements of this gift in his final days, hoping to ensure the facility’s health and vitality for years to come. “Danny gets all the credit for this,” Nelson said. “It’s a shame he didn’t live long enough to see all of this finalized.” “Danny was super excited about this,” YMCA Executive Director Chris Williams said. Just how excited became apparent as family members took on the sad but necessary task of going through the Danielson house after his death. Williams said the relatives reported finding sticky notes with Nelson’s phone number on several locations throughout the home. “Danny was an individual who always returned my telephone calls, good times and bad,” Nelson reflected. “He was a very creative person, very low key, very easy going but very objective in getting things done. He never lost sight of what the goal was. His passing was a great loss for everyone.” Nelson said Danielson’s business savvy and true blue loyalty proved to be a potent formula that turned possibilities into so many success stories. That seed of confidence Danielson helped Nelson plant in 1971 has grown to impressive proportions for “a middle class kid” from Indianapolis. “I really can’t believe the success I’ve had when I stop and think about it,” Nelson said. “Only in America could this happen. I was able to start my own hedge fund that has generated a 27 percent return annually over the past seven years. I am really humbled by it.” But Nelson says none of that makes him a successful man. The things that make him fulfilled today are the blessings of a wonderful, supportive wife who is a source of encouragement; the knowledge that families enjoyed a quality of life in his apartment communities; that kids are getting a better education than they could dream of through his foundation; and that Henry County citizens young and old will be strengthened by the YMCA for years and years to come. And above all, that his most recent gift to the YMCA in New Castle would have dear departed friend Danny Danielson smiling.

E. Shuman Albert Einstein once stated, and I paraphrase: ‘We must accept the premise that either nothing is a miracle, or everything is a miracle.’ Well, Mr. Einstein, I am one who, if that premise is true, believes that everything is a miracle. I have eyes, and I can clearly see this beautiful, immensely complex world. From your statement, I think you saw it, too. I certainly do believe that miracles happen, and that they probably happen more frequently than we realize. After 62 years of living and of observing life, I don’t see how I could ever believe otherwise. I also believe that miracles are where you find them, and that, to our dismay, sometimes we don’t even look for them. I don’t think that this means some miracles are ‘small’, in fact, I think that none of them are small. They are all big, especially when they happen to you. I’m writing about this today because of something that happened to my grandson, Devon, just last Sunday evening. It was about 10 p.m., and that thoughtful grandson of mine had just driven to the Walmart in Manchester, NH, where he and his family live. He had gone to the store because his girlfriend was having a craving for oranges, and he wanted to buy her some. What a nice guy, right? Somehow, during that late night run to the store, Devon’s wallet had slipped out his pocket, in the huge parking lot. Now, it’s never good to lose your wallet, but much worse when that wallet contains your license, your debit card, your social security card, and, (this part gives me a sick feeling in my stomach) $400 in cash from the paycheck you had just received. Ouch! It also didn’t help that the wallet was lost in that large city, at a very busy shopping center. We, as a family, believe in the power of prayer. So do our children, and, also, their children. Our daughter, Cathy, (Devon’s mom) and her distraught son obviously prayed that night, and so did my wife and I, and others, when we heard about what had happened. Yes, you need to understand, this was a joint effort. “For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there I am in the midst of them.” Matthew 18:20. Holy Bible. Okay, so now let me tell you about the miracle. (Pay attention, as there will be a quiz.) As I’m sure you have already guessed, the wallet was found, which, to me, was miracle enough. A young lady about Devon’s age contacted him on Facebook, told him she had found his wallet, and asked if they could meet so that she could give it back to him. They arranged that, and Devon went to meet her. To Devon’s surprise, and obvious relief, his wallet still contained his license, his debit card, his social security card, AND the $400 from his hard-earned paycheck. Wow! My grandson thankfully offered to give that young lady a reward for what she had done, or to at least buy dinner for her, but she wouldn’t let him. Devon told her that it was a huge blessing for him, and she replied that people have done many good things to help her before, and she wanted to help him. Now…here’s the quiz. Did you understand the miracle, or did you miss it? It was surely a ‘God thing’ that Devon got his wallet back, with his identification, his license, and even his money…every penny of it. To my grandson, I’m sure this was no small miracle. Still, to my mind, the miracle really happened in the heart of a young stranger, who found someone’s wallet in a parking lot that night, could have kept the cash, thrown the wallet away, and never given a thought to finding its owner. No one would have ever known. Really, no one would have. Instead, this young lady chose to remember what others have done for her, and to ‘pay it forward’ with no thought of self, and without ANY reward, even when it was offered. In this strange year of terrorism, fear, and an increasingly nasty presidential election which seems to shout uncertainty, distress, and danger for the future of our nation, there are still people of integrity, and still young people of surprisingly sterling morals. This, to me, is no small miracle. QR Code – Take this post Mobile! Use this unique QR (Quick Response) code with your smart device.

The supermarket biz said the glitch was an "unforeseeable" incident which began on Saturday night affecting home deliveries and click-and-collect purchases. An Asda spokesperson said the issue has been resolved: "As an apology to our customers affected by a technical glitch today during a major system upgrade we are offering a £15 discount and are rebooking their orders for as soon as convenient to them." One customer got in touch to say he was told the issue originated with Asda's US parent company, Walmart. "We did manage to get a home delivery on Sunday and the driver told us that it had been a national problem," he said. "I was somewhat incredulous at the thought that an organisation like Walmart would have a single point of failure which could wipe out their global delivery capability!"

While stopping a silver Lexus on Route 23 North for an unclear temporary license plate, Patrolman Mike Reilly observed that the driver – identified as Chad Hines, 37, of Vernon – had dried blood on the top of his right hand, according to police. Furthermore, both Hines and his passenger, Annamarie Alvarez, 32, of Little Ferry, appeared to be nervous, said Lt. James MacIntosh in a press release. Upon investigation, police allegedly found that Alvarez was in possession of empty wax folds used to package heroin and a needle cap in her purse. A hypodermic needle was discovered in the trunk, MacIntosh added. He said Hines was charged with possession of a hypodermic needle, while Alvarez was charged with possession of drug paraphernalia – both disorderly person offenses. Hines also received summonses for unclear plate and tinted windows, police said. They were released with a Municipal Court date in October. Suspect found hiking in ravine A Boonton man suspected of shoplifting from Walmart was found hiding in a rocky ravine with a dislocated shoulder at almost 2 p.m. on Oct. 12. According to police, Detective Sgt. Chris Biro responded to the store for a shoplifting suspect who was attempting to flee the store with a $229 Smart Lock. The man was later identified as Frederick Trautvetter, 36. "As Detective Sgt. Biro arrived, the suspect ran from the store and into the wooded area behind the garden center," said Lt. James MacIntosh in a press release. "The suspect refused to stop when ordered by police." Riverdale officers along with Bloomingdale and Kinnelon police located the suspect in the woods between Walmart and Interstate 287 South. Due to his injury, Trautvetter was taken into custody and transported to Chilton Medical Center. Trautvetter was charged with shoplifting and resisting arrest, both fourth-degree crimes. He was released with an appearance at Morris County Central Judicial Processing in October. Shoplifting complaint A 26-year-old Oak Ridge man was charged with both shoplifting and possession of drug paraphernalia after being halted by Walmart store security on Oct. 13 at 5:45 p.m. Responding to the store off Route 23, Sgt. Chuck Quant learned that Scott Wassmer had attempted to take a portable power station valued at $99.94. He was also determined to be in possession of a glass pipe used to smoke marijuana, said Lt. James MacIntosh in a press release. Wassmer was released with a Municipal Court date in October. "Police news" is compiled by Suburban Trends from information provided by the police department.

Furthermore, both Hines and his passenger, Annamarie Alvarez, 32, of Little Ferry, appeared to be nervous, said Lt. James MacIntosh in a press release. Upon investigation, police allegedly found that Alvarez was in possession of empty wax folds used to package heroin and a needle cap in her purse. A hypodermic needle was discovered in the trunk, MacIntosh added. He said Hines was charged with possession of a hypodermic needle, while Alvarez was charged with possession of drug paraphernalia – both disorderly person offenses. Hines also received summonses for unclear plate and tinted windows, police said. They were released with a Municipal Court date in October. Suspect found hiking in ravine A Boonton man suspected of shoplifting from Walmart was found hiding in a rocky ravine with a dislocated shoulder at almost 2 p.m. on Oct. 12. According to police, Detective Sgt. Chris Biro responded to the store for a shoplifting suspect who was attempting to flee the store with a $229 Smart Lock. The man was later identified as Frederick Trautvetter, 36. "As Detective Sgt. Biro arrived, the suspect ran from the store and into the wooded area behind the garden center," said Lt. James MacIntosh in a press release. "The suspect refused to stop when ordered by police." Riverdale officers along with Bloomingdale and Kinnelon police located the suspect in the woods between Walmart and Interstate 287 South. Due to his injury, Trautvetter was taken into custody and transported to Chilton Medical Center. Trautvetter was charged with shoplifting and resisting arrest, both fourth-degree crimes. He was released with an appearance at Morris County Central Judicial Processing in October. Shoplifting complaint A 26-year-old Oak Ridge man was charged with both shoplifting and possession of drug paraphernalia after being halted by Walmart store security on Oct. 13 at 5:45 p.m. Responding to the store off Route 23, Sgt. Chuck Quant learned that Scott Wassmer had attempted to take a portable power station valued at $99.94. He was also determined to be in possession of a glass pipe used to smoke marijuana, said Lt. James MacIntosh in a press release. Wassmer was released with a Municipal Court date in October. "Police news" is compiled by Suburban Trends from information provided by the police department.

Possibly you're at a Lightning game tucking into a fat bratwurst or even one of the crazy 24-inch hot dogs sold during playoff games. Do you wonder about these wieners? Who made them and how? In the last gasping days before this interminable election cycle comes to a close, it is easy to nod along with what John Godfrey Saxe purportedly wrote in the Daily Cleveland Herald in 1869: "Laws, like sausages, cease to inspire respect in proportion as we know how they are made." But after you've donned a hair net, a heavy set of coveralls and rubber boots, then spent an afternoon at Uncle John's Pride sausage factory near Brandon, respect doesn't shrivel one iota. A vast warren of rooms filled with gleaming stainless steel vats and industrial mechanical "flakers," everything is spotless and nothing smells funny. Even the ingredients — boneless frozen meat blocks, spices, water — don't inspire a moment's queasiness. A drop in the bucket when compared to the mega-links of Hillshire Farms, this local company manufactures nearly 8 million pounds of sausage a year. "We're more like craft sausage — regional, like beer," owner Scott McBride explains. "We're pretty much everywhere in Central Florida and moving into Georgia, Alabama and South Carolina. We want to go national, but not tomorrow." With 72 employees and more than 100 different products, Uncle John's is a conundrum. It's high-tech but nostalgic. It's ambitiously growing at the same time it celebrates old-timey family values. Uncle John's products are everywhere, carried in Winn-Dixie, Publix and Walmart. And yet you may never have heard its name. • • • Uncle John's makes sausage the old-fashioned way, coarsely ground and naturally hickory smoked, no "mechanically separated chicken" or mystery meat. Johnny Pellegrini has worked at Uncle John's for 22 years, his dad Myron did too until he died. Chris Tyler has been here 36 years, and all five of his brothers and his dad Jack worked here. Chief operating officer Rick Bernaldo got here in 1989, and the two Marys (Graves and Vansolkema) are tied at 24 years each. Add the top 20 employees' tenures together and they've spent 386 years working at Uncle John's. Noble Crofton started the company in 1972, moving to the current location in 1975, and the plant has expanded five times since then. A company that started with five employees grew to become a full-line distributor of boxed beef, pork, sausages and deli meats, eventually selling to independent grocery stores in Florida. It grew to $30 million, went through bankruptcy in 1989 and refocused its efforts to sell solely manufactured product. Times change. Uncle John's no longer manufactures smoked offal or neck bones; they used to sell 100,000 pounds of neck bones a week, back when folks used them to flavor soups an add a little savor to stewed greens. They no longer make souse meat (that's hogshead cheese with vinegar). They've gone away from MSG; their sausages are gluten-free. They've stepped away from sodium nitrate and developed all-natural products. The way they've grown — and the reason you may not have heard of them — is through strategic acquisition. First there was Bean Brothers Sausage with its old Tennessee recipe handed down for generations since 1922, then Peppino's, a fresh Italian sausage company in St. Petersburg (this gained them access to food service companies like Sysco and U.S. Foods and got their foot in the door at Walmart). In 2013, Garcia Smoked Sausage in Miami had a fire and came looking for a temporary manufacturer. They're made by Uncle John's now, as is Real Tree Foods, which they bought from Jordan Outdoors, a national brand for outdoorsmen known for its high-end camo. • • • Each day at Uncle John's, it's about the recipe. Today it's Bean Brothers sausage? That's a little spicier with more sage. Making Garcia next? That's got other ingredients like beef heart and tongue with a finer grind, more like a hot dog bite. A batch of link sausage starts as 2,000 pounds of meat, mostly boneless pork picnics from mega-companies like Smithfield or JBS (they go through 50,000 pounds of picnic per week). It is flaked and ground, creating six stainless tubs of ground meat that cures for 24 hours before it is stuffed. There are three stuffers on at a time, automatically making links at intervals, then hangers loop the sausage swiftly over "trees," a rack on wheels with 50 arms. Watch Hector: He loops the emerging sausage like disobedient snakes, aiming for 15 to 19 loops on each arm of the tree. Laden with 750 pounds of sausage, a tree is wheeled into the smokehouse for anywhere from three to four hours. Computer-driven smokers are like giant walk-in ovens that are gas fired with a convection system that controls the humidity and amount of smoke. There are thermometers inside the ovens and inside the sausages themselves. Hickory sawdust goes through smoke generators, is shoveled up high and feeds the coils to produce smoke. "It's all computer programmed," says Bernaldo, "but you still need to have a smoke guy who knows what he's doing by eye." From there, the sausage goes through a brine chiller that takes the sausages from 100 degrees to 40 degrees, as per USDA mandate. Then it's into the room of vacuum-pack machines. Sanitation is heavy duty in here — lots of foot baths, handwashing and gloves. There's a fresh sausage room where meat is ground, bagged, boxed, taped and run through a metal detector; a huge freezer for finished goods and raw materials; plus a loading dock, conference rooms and break rooms. And through it all, a crew aimed at maximizing efficiency. "We measure efficiency as pounds per man hour," says Bernaldo at the end of the tour. "We were running in the 40s, and now we're in the 70s." Forget the sage and hickory smoke. It seems like the most important ingredient at Uncle John's is its employees. Maybe that's the most salient thing about how the sausage is made. Contact Laura Reiley at lreiley@tampabay.com or (727) 892-2293. Follow @lreiley on Twitter.

Then he added shirts, belts, casual wear, colognes, ties. The result is perhaps the most appealing masculine boutique Washington has ever seen. Welcome to Avenue Jack. By Doug Rule on October 20, 2016 @ruleonwriting Share Tweet Share Share 0 comments Scott Wallis: Avenue Jack — Photo: Todd Franson From stints in the Bush White House and at two leading libertarian think tanks, to a foray into the fun albeit profit-free world of podcasting, no chapter in the book of Scott Wallis reads quite like the one that came before. The story is a page-turner, much like one of the mystery novels he writes in his spare time, brought to life through vivid, only-in-D.C. details. A little over a year ago, Wallis embarked on his most ambitious adventure yet — Avenue Jack, a men’s casual retail shop south of Dupont Circle, nestled between Luna Grill and a Starbucks, steps away from the Metro. “Dale came up with the name,” Wallis says, referring to business partner Dale Blades, with whom he co-hosted the gay comedy podcast Swish Edition for several years. “We literally wrote down dozens and dozens of names and Avenue Jack just seemed to work.” Retail wasn’t an obvious career move for either man, but in recent years, D.C. has seen a resurgence of independent boutique retailers like Avenue Jack, particularly in trendy, revitalizing neighborhoods. “I wanted to be on 14th Street,” Wallis says. “All the stores like Shinola, Filson, Federal — there’s great shopping over there. But the rents over there are ridiculous — over 100 dollars a square foot. We couldn’t afford that.” For the moment, he’s content with his Dupont Circle location. “We’re getting business people, we’re getting tourists,” he says. “More and more, we’re getting locals.” Wallis is drawing people to the store by holding events. Powered by food and drink provided by neighboring vendors, the store has hosted small fundraisers for local organizations on a regular basis. Boasting a dark copper tin ceiling and cedar walls to dark brown-stained hardwood floors, Avenue Jack has a deep, masculine feel to it. It’s comfortable, intimate. “We were going for kind of a cross between a gentleman’s club and a mountain chalet,” Wallis says. “I just wanted it to be a really warm antithesis of what so many stores are now. You walk into H&M or Walmart or Gap and they’re so bright white, with overhead lights. We don’t have one fluorescent light in here. It’s as warm as possible.” Just like the soft-spoken 46-year-old himself, who is as forthcoming (and, this being Washington, politically outspoken) as he is congenial and welcoming. He’s proud of his accomplishments, and rightfully so. Retail isn’t an easy mountain to scale, but Wallis, who is the very embodiment of persistence and drive, is determined to reach its peak and plant his flag. For Scott Wallis, it’s most definitely a man’s world. Scott Wallis: Avenue Jack — Photo: Todd Franson METRO WEEKLY: Let’s start with what brought you to D.C. SCOTT WALLIS: I grew up in Williamsburg, Virginia. Not too far away — at least two and a half hours, but with horrible I-95 traffic, it can take a lot longer than that. I went to college at Radford University in Southwest Virginia. While I was in college I got the opportunity to work for then-Vice President Dan Quayle. I took a semester off from school to come work full-time in his office, in the Old Executive Office Building. And I worked directly for his Director of Administration. MW: Are you a Republican? WALLIS: I was at the time, yeah. I’m not anymore. Not since immediately after college, when I went to work at the Cato Institute, the libertarian think tank. Then I realized the error of my ways and became an independent. I don’t associate with any party. MW: When did you come out? WALLIS: I don’t know if I ever did. I think I just always was. I started telling friends in high school. I don’t think I talked about it when I worked at the White House. But certainly in high school, my good friends knew. I didn’t tell my parents until after college because I was afraid they might cut off my funding for college, but they’ve been very cool about it. They’re super Republican. Voting for Trump. Very religious. But they’ve accepted me. I’ve been with my partner now for 22 years and we go on vacations together and they stay at our house and come to all the holidays and stuff. So they’ve been very supportive. We don’t talk about politics or religion though. MW: What religion are they? WALLIS: My mom’s a Christian Scientist. MW: Who don’t believe in medical science. WALLIS: That’s right. And it was tough growing up that way. Both my parents are pilots — dad was a commercial pilot and mom was a private pilot. So they only had so much leeway. As a pilot you have to get a physical every six months to keep your license. They had to go through the hoops. They had to, to be able to fly. They did do that. MW: Did you interact with the gay community while working for Dan Quayle? WALLIS: No. At that point I’d never been to a gay bar. I had gay friends and I had dated but I’d never, ever been to a gay bar, and I thought they were so scary. Even though JR.’s was just up the street, two blocks from where I was living, I wouldn’t go, because I was deathly afraid to go there. I don’t know what I thought was going to happen to me. MW: Did homosexuality ever come up while you were working for Quayle? Did you ever feel uncomfortable? WALLIS: No, but Dan Quayle was amazing. I mean he’s a lot more conservative than I am, but he’s a great, great guy. And I got to know him really well. I did a lot of family trips, I didn’t do official trips. So I spent a lot of time with his kids. And whenever I would take the kids out without the parents, he’d want to talk to me. So it would be just the two of us sitting around talking. That was pretty cool. I don’t know how many people get to just sit and talk to the Vice President of the United States like that at such an age. MW: Did you ever bring a date to a White House function? WALLIS: I certainly did not. But I wasn’t even dating anyone at that point, so it wasn’t a problem. I went by myself or went with other friends from the White House. MW: I understand you also have a connection to the conservative Koch brothers beyond their involvement at Cato. WALLIS: I was the Creative Director at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University for four years, which is another libertarian, free-market think tank co-founded by Charles Koch. I did fundraising and event planning, all kinds of stuff. I was in charge of the website. I also oversaw all publications. It was a big job. MW: The Koch brothers aren’t strictly Libertarian anymore though. WALLIS: Well, they were. David Koch was the Libertarian Party vice presidential nominee at one point. But no, I think they’re pretty aligned with the GOP now — except I don’t believe they’re supporting Trump. MW: How do you feel about Trump? WALLIS: I think he’s the antichrist. [Laughs.] He’s horrible, in every possible way. Just the flat-out lies. Right after the debate, the press said, “You said you’re smart because you didn’t pay any taxes” and he said, “I didn’t say that.” The whole world just heard you say it, dumbass. He’s awful. We have to do everything we can to make sure that man doesn’t become president. And [Libertarian Party presidential candidate] Gary Johnson, who I did like up until recently, we need him to go away. What he did on MSNBC — you can’t name one frigging world leader? Not one? That’s inexcusable. If I was [running mate] William Weld, I’d drop out. I’d walk away from Gary. They have no possibility of winning, so they just need to go away. MW: Do you like Hillary Clinton? WALLIS: No, I can’t stand her. MW: So you won’t be voting for her, then? WALLIS: Does it matter who I vote for? I live in Washington, D.C. My vote doesn’t count. D.C. is going to vote for Hillary Clinton by at least 85 percent, so it doesn’t really matter who I vote for. But I certainly won’t be voting for Trump. MW: What should we do to ensure that he doesn’t get elected? WALLIS: We have to convince people in Pennsylvania, Colorado, Florida not to vote for him. MW: Are you going to do anything? WALLIS: Besides putting up articles about how horrible Trump is on social media? No. MW: Is there any hope of convincing your parents not to vote for him? WALLIS: No. Sometimes we’ll start talking about certain things. I mean I certainly agree with them on certain issues. I am fairly conservative on fiscal issues. I don’t think we need to be giving everything to everyone for free, or guaranteeing everything to everyone. I don’t think the government needs to be a 100 percent safety net for every single citizen. That’s going to bankrupt us someday. I mean Hillary getting up there and promising everyone free college is such a joke. It’s never going to happen. Of course she likes to say it, over and over again. And if you do give everyone free college, doesn’t it just become 13th, 14th, 15th and 16th grades? Does a college education really mean anything if every single person in the country gets to go just like they do up until the 12th grade? That’s one of my big things. Should it be more affordable? Yes. And we should work on ways to do that, but I don’t think it should be free. Because it dumbs it down for everybody. When it becomes free and everyone can go, it’s not special anymore. Photo Spread: The newest fall fashions for men at Avenue Jack. MW: Do you miss being in politics? WALLIS: No. And I don’t miss working 9 to 5, either. I don’t think I could ever work in an office again. It’s been twelve years since I’ve had a job where someone else is paying me. MW: When did you get into fashion and retail? WALLIS: About ten years ago my family started a baby clothes manufacturing company — House of Mongrel. We had a little mongrel dog as the mascot. I did this with my sister and brother-in-law. We designed all the clothes, and we had them produced. They were all organic, all made in America — which were two of our big mistakes. Being all made in America and being all organic is very expensive, which kept us out of a lot of stores. We could never get the big contracts that we really needed, like Target or the mainstream chains. We did get into about 350 stores across the country, which was really exciting, including some stores here in D.C. After that project was over, that’s when the concept of opening our own store for guys came about. The original concept was to open a super gay underwear store. My partner Dennis and I were in London and we went into this underwear store. And I absolutely fell in love with it. The shopping in London is amazing. There are just so many cute little independent stores. You definitely knew you were walking into a gay store. And they had this great underwear, Bluebuck underwear, which I fell in love with. I bought a pair and I’m like, “You know what? We should go home and open a super gay underwear store and give Universal Gear a run for the money, because their stuff is so expensive.” So that was the idea — to get a small space and just sell underwear. We put a business plan together for that. And after going to trade shows, I thought, “You know what, why don’t we add t-shirts?” And then, “Maybe we should add jeans. And what about coats? Jackets? And then of course people are going to need belts.” Eventually, we got to, “Let’s not just be a gay underwear store, let’s be a store for everybody.” And then it became this. And we ended up with two-thousand square feet. A casual men’s clothing store. No ties, no jackets, no blazers, no suits. There are a million stores in D.C. that do that so we’re not even going to try to touch that. We just wanted to be as mainstream as possible. Preppy, casual, comfortable, moderately priced. MW: Is that still the mission? WALLIS: Well, now that Universal Gear is gone we’ve upped our underwear game a little bit by adding C-IN2, and we have jockstraps now. I don’t know if any straight guys have bought them, but we’ve certainly sold them to gay guys. MW: What’s been the biggest surprise since you opened? WALLIS: Oh my gosh. Tons and tons of stuff. I didn’t anticipate that half of our customers would be women, buying stuff for guys. That’s been eye-opening. We thought it would be all guys, not knowing that women buy the majority of straight guys’ stuff for them. We also didn’t realize we’d get as many out-of-towners, tourists. I think that’s probably because of the neck of the woods that we’re in. We’ve got the Mayflower just a block down. We’ve got the Dupont Circle Hotel. The Washington Hilton sends people to us all the time — when business guys forget a tie or forget their belt or forget their underwear. The concierges have been really great about that, and we’ve definitely gone out of our way to make friends with the concierges. MW: You’re also reaching out to the community. WALLIS: We do a lot of events here, running specials. Last week we had a big party for SMYAL. And I don’t think we’ve had more people in the store — it was really crowded. I couldn’t make it from the front door to the back. MW: What keeps people coming back to Avenue Jack over other stores? WALLIS: We have a great loyalty program. For every dollar you spend you get a point, and your points add up to free store credits. So instead of giving our best customers 15 percent off or something, they’re getting points, and then they can use that store credit towards stuff that they want. We try to communicate with them when we have new stuff that we think they might be interested in. MW: Such as? WALLIS: I’m really excited about Faherty, which is a kind of surf-inspired brand. And Grayers, started by a former head designer for Ralph Lauren. Just great classic preppy shirts and ties and jackets. And we have Herschel and Timbuk2 bags. MW: You also carry giftable, non-clothing items. WALLIS: That wasn’t even on our radar when we first opened, but now we have a lot of it and we sell a lot of it. We have the D.C. map glassware. We have the cocktailing stuff, like the carry-on cocktail kit and the pineapple tumbler. Those things — our D.C. pillows, the neighborhood pillows with all the names on it, the neighborhood coasters, the glass coasters — they’re made right here in the city. That stuff has done really, really well for us. Again, mostly women buy that stuff. They come in here looking for a gift for their boyfriend or husband or brother, and we try to steer them away from buying something that is going to be returned. Like, if they buy him that medium sweater and he’s like an extra large or hates that color — it’s hard to buy clothes for other people. I’ve never quite understood that. I think people should buy their own clothes. But we’ll sell them — if you want to buy it, we’ll sell it to you. [Laughs.] But most likely, it’s coming back. So that’s why having the gifty stuff is great. I mean, they can buy a SlideBelt, which fits anybody. They can buy the D.C. glassware or grooming stuff or a tie. Soap or cologne. MW: How do you decide on what cologne to carry? WALLIS: They had to be stuff that you’re not going to find in every major department store. So the ones we have right now are craft small-batch, made in Austin, Texas, called Moonshine, Bluegrass. It’s kind of a musky, earthy scent without being overpowering. I’m not a cologne user or wearer, but my customers like them and we sell a lot of it. MW: How often are you here in the store? WALLIS: Every day. Every day that I’m in town. I have days off but I inevitably end up in here anyway. MW: You haven’t taken a vacation? WALLIS: No, not as vacation. I’ve gone on a couple trips. We go to Vegas twice a year to buy for the store. We go to New York a lot to go to showrooms and stuff. I recently went to Boston for my cousin’s wedding. But these are things I have to do. I haven’t done a real vacation yet. MW: What are your plans for the future? A second location? WALLIS: That’s the goal. I don’t think we could ever make enough money to make this worthwhile just having one store. If you look at what David did with Universal Gear, I mean at one point he had five or six stores. Lou Lou and South Man Under are both local chains that started with one store. One’s never enough. You’ve got to have more. And if you’re going to do all this work, it’s actually not that much more work to do a second store. Having other locations was part of the original business plan. Of course I thought we’d be working on store number two by now. I don’t think we’re quite ready for that. We definitely want to keep it within the DMV somewhere. We’d like to produce our own clothes too. Right now we just have logo T-shirts. We’ve got some canvas bags and we’ve got some hats. But we’d like to make our own stuff. Eventually. We feel really good. We keep growing. It’s going to take some more time before we have proof of concept, I guess. And hopefully that’ll happen. We’re coming now to the most important part of the year, our strongest quarter by far. Last December — our first — was the first month that we were in the black. We expect that that will happen again, even more so this year now that more people know that we’re here. MW: Have you got any plans outside of Avenue Jack? WALLIS: My personal goal ever since college has been to be a published author. And my ultimate, ultimate goal is to publish a book a year. That’s what I’ve always wanted to do. I didn’t realize it was so damn hard. MW: The writing? WALLIS: To get published. The writing is the easy part, and I have a great editor that I work with that helps me polish stuff. I tried for well over a decade and then decided just to publish my own stuff. I finally have secured a book agent, so I’m trying to finish my current book and hopefully we’ll be able to sell that to a publisher. I’m feverishly trying to finish the book but it’s not easy while running the store. My goal is to finish it by the end of the year.I have my fingers crossed that I’ll actually be able to sell something. MW: Is it a mystery like your self-published book, Scout’s Honor? WALLIS: Yeah, dark humor mysteries, that’s what I write. MW: Are you a big mystery movie type of guy? WALLIS: I watch a lot of TV, I don’t watch as many movies. But I’m a humongous James Bond fan. I’ve seen all the James Bond movies like ten times each. My stuff’s not spy-related, but I do love that kind of thing. I don’t know if you’re familiar with Stuart Woods — he writes three books a year, and I read every single one. I would love to be at a place where I’m publishing three books a year. And he’s got his own airplane and four houses. He does really well for himself. I just want to sell one. I don’t even care if anyone buys it. I just want a publishing house to agree to publish a book. That would be just absolutely thrilling for me.

Part of the land, in blue on the left, is at the intersection of Brock's Gap Parkway and South Shades Crest Road. The other portion is along Stadium Trace Parkway across from Hoover Metropolitan Stadium. A large group of residents from Hoover’s Trace Crossings community and other neighborhoods off South Shades Crest Road came to the Hoover zoning board meeting tonight to oppose changes in the Trace Crossings development plan. U.S.S. Corp. wants to amend the plan so that vacant property currently zoned for restricted industrial use would be rezoned so it could only be used for commercial or office space. Residents typically favor commercial and office space near residential subdivisions more than industrial zoning, but the vast majority of people who came to tonight’s meeting were against the changes. The land in question is in two locations. One area is at the intersection of Brock’s Gap Parkway and South Shades Crest Road (on both sides of South Shades Crest Road), and the other is along Stadium Trace Parkway, directly across from Hoover Metropolitan Stadium. Molly McGregor, a resident of the Chestnut Ridge portion of Trace Crossings who served as a spokeswoman for many of the residents, said the USS Corp. proposal is an outrage. Residents were willing to embrace a small neighborhood shopping center at the intersection of Stadium Trace and Brock’s Gap parkways, but they do not want to see general commercial development that deep into the Trace Crossings community, McGregor said. Yes, the new $80 million sports complex being built next to the Hoover Met is going to create more demand for hotel space in Hoover, McGregor said, but hotels and the developments that come with them don’t belong in the middle of neighborhoods. They belong in a commercial corridor, such as John Hawkins Parkway, she said. Several residents said they fear hotels and other 24-hour businesses will bring more crime to their neighborhoods and the three schools in Trace Crossings. And both Stadium Trace Parkway and South Shades Crest Road already are too congested with traffic, residents said. Donald Barley, a resident of the Creekside subdivision in Trace Crossings, noted that the Hoover City Council in April of last year already denied U.S. Steel’s attempt to rezone 26 acres at the intersection of Brock’s Gap Parkway and South Shades Crest Road to make way for a Walmart Neighborhood Market. Nothing has changed since that time to make it a better idea now, he said. “It’s never going to be a good idea,” Barley said. Warren Kuntz, a resident of the Willow Lakes community off South Shades Crest Road, was the only resident to speak in favor of the proposed changes. He believes the changes might enhance residents’ property values, he said. He also noted that Stadium Trace Parkway is not a residential street. Justin Armstrong, manager of commercial sales and development for U.S.S. Real Estate, said he can’t understand why any residents would prefer industrial property next to their homes over commercial or office space. Industrial use is not a good fit for the areas in question, he said. Armstrong noted that a comprehensive planning committee for which McGregor served as chairwoman for the city of Hoover in 2003 recommended the property at the intersection of Brock’s Gap Parkway and South Shades Crest Road be zoned commercial. Armstrong also said a Walmart is no longer in the plans. Regarding the property along Stadium Trace Parkway, he noted that any buildings would have to be at least 200 feet off the property line and would be down the hill from Chestnut Ridge. “Nobody’s going to be in anybody’s backyard,” he said. Planning Commission Chairman Mike Wood said residents should understand that the property as currently zoned could be used for warehouses, manufacturing, fabricating, woodworking, assembly plants, print shops or other light industrial uses. “It’s not like it’s going to stay woods,” Wood said. “It won’t. It’s too valuable a piece of property." If they successfully defeat commercial and office uses, “they’re rolling the dice,” Wood said in the zoning board’s work session before tonight’s meeting. McGregor said residents understand the risks, but they believe the land is much more likely to stay unsold and undeveloped if it is zoned for restricted industrial uses. “We understand the risks to our neighborhoods, our children, our schools and our safety,” she said. × Expand Photo by Jon Anderson Hoover zoning board 10-10-16 Dozens of Hoover residents showed up at the Hoover Planning and Zoning Commission meeting on Monday, Oct. 10, 2016, to oppose USS Corp's efforts to amend the Trace Crossings zoning plan. Zoning board member Sammy Harris said as more houses are built farther down Stadium Trace Parkway, some of those people might want commercial development along Stadium Trace so they won’t have to travel all the way back to John Hawkins Parkway. Councilman John Lyda, who also sits on the zoning board, said residents tend to buy into development plans better when the developer presents a strong vision for the property and outlines what he would like to see on it. “Right now, this thing is shrouded in mystery,” Lyda said. At Wood’s recommendation, the zoning board voted to continue the case until Nov. 14 to give USS Corp. a chance to meet again with residents and try to work out a compromise, with assistance from Hoover planning consultant Bob House. House said he would work with McGregor and Armstrong to set up a meeting. McGregor at first said residents were not ready to compromise, noting that Armstrong previously had called them “spineless cowards,” but she later agreed to another meeting.

The Market In 5 Minutes: A Couple Of Pharma Stocks Move 70% In Opposite Directions E.l.f. Clears Buy Point; Ulta Tries To Retake 50-Day Line (Investor's Business Daily) Target Corporation (NYSE: TGT) is now the largest corporate installer of solar power in the United States, according to Electrek. Target now boasts 147MW of installed solar power across 300 stores, which exceeds Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE: WMT)'s solar installed base of 130MW while Ikea, the popular furniture, appliances and home accessories seller, has installed solar power modules across 90 percent of its retail locations. Electrek, citing data from the Solar Energy Institute of America (SEIA), reported that over 1,000MW of solar power has been installed in nearly 2,000 retail locations and stores across the United States. Related Link: Coming Soon To Target Fashion Items From Victoria Beckham Electrek further noted that financial reasoning often tops the list of why corporate America is focusing on green energy. In fact, environmental reasoning is more often than not even part of the sales conversation between companies and solar power providers. The three main factors companies consider prior to installing solar panels include access to good sunlight, non-solar electricity rates and state level renewable mandates. Despite having less sunlight than Southern California, the northeast United States is a major hub for commercial solar installations given expensive electricity rates and aggressive clean energy pushes at the state level. Finally, Electrek stated that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) remains a leader in its commitment toward renewable energy is aiming for 4,000MW of solar power to be installed across its properties across the world.

(Rick Bowner/Associated Press) By BECKY Kramer, The Spokesman-Review Published: October 24, 2016, 6:01 AM A   A Demand for carbon-free energy is starting to influence how electricity is produced in Washington. In about two years, corporate and government clients of a Western Washington utility will be able to buy 100 percent of their electricity from new, renewable energy projects. Puget Sound Energy’s program is the first of its kind in the state. Customers who sign up for the voluntary program will pay more for the all-renewable electricity from the Bellevue-based utility, but they’ll be able to track their kilowatt consumption back to specific wind farms or solar installations. “They wanted something that was cost-effective. They also wanted to be able to point to a new solar farm, or a new wind farm, and say, ‘That was built because of our commitment,’ ” said Tom MacLean, manager of customer renewable energy programs for Puget Sound Energy, which serves about 1.1 million electric customers. Outdoor retailer REI, which has 11 Washington stores, was among the first utility customers to approach Puget Sound Energy, MacLean said. The utility has also heard from Target, Wal-Mart and other members of the Renewable Energy Buyers Alliance, which formed with the help of the World Wildlife Fund and World Resources Institute to assist large corporations with affordable ways to reduce their carbon footprint. More than 60 companies are part of the alliance, representing hundreds of megawatts of new demand for renewable energy, according to World Resources Institute, a Washington, D.C.-based group. Like other Northwest utilities, Puget Sound Energy gets part of its electricity from hydropower dams and wind generation, MacLean said. But the utility also has coal- and natural gas-fired electric plants. Initially, Puget Sound Energy will limit the program to 75 megawatts of electricity. That represents the average output of two large wind farms, MacLean said. A large grocery store uses about one-half of a megawatt of electricity, so a company with 10 stores would require about 5 megawatts, he said. The Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission approved the program in late September. State oversight helps ensure that program costs don’t get shifted onto other utility customers, said Jeremy Twitchell, the UTC’s energy policy adviser. Puget Sound Energy is starting to market the new program to prospective customers, including local and state governments. But since the construction of new wind farms is required, the program’s roll-out is about two years away, MacLean said. Participating companies will sign 10- to 20-year contracts for the all-renewable energy, which helps give them price certainty, he said. Avista Corp. is also assessing customers’ interest in renewable energy, said Mary Tyrie, a company spokeswoman. About 1 percent of the Spokane-based utility’s electric customers participate in the Buck A Block program. Customers who opt in pay an extra $1 for 300 kilowatt blocks of electricity. Avista uses the extra money to purchase renewable energy credits, primarily from wind farms, said Chris Drake, Avista’s energy efficiency manager. The credits offset electricity in Avista’s portfolio generated from burning fossil fuels.
