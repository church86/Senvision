In a new scam, thieves are draining money from the cards once shoppers load them up. Pearl City teen Michael Tam is one of many local victims. He got a $75 Walmart gift card for Christmas and wanted to buy a Nerf gun for some fun. "I was happy that I got what I wanted for Christmas," Tam said. But when he tried to make the purchase at Walmart, there was a big surprise. "I swiped the card and it said the card balance was zero," he said. A search of the gift card's history showed his relative bought it in Torrance, Calif., but the balance was drained five days later in a different California city. "What we believe is happening is that people within the store, either an employee of the store or an actual thief, steals the cards," said Gregory Dunn, president and CEO of Hawaii's Better Business Bureau. Dunn said consumers shouldn't buy gift cards from store racks because they're open to thieves. "They'll steal the card, take them home, be very careful about opening the card up, remove the pin number scratch, record the card and the pin number and then re-affix a scratch off cover over the pin," he said. The Better Business Bureau says once the scammers have the card number and pin, they wait for it to be activated. As soon as the amount is shown, they can steal the money in an instant. "Criminals are finding new ways to use new technology to cheat you out of your hard earned money," Dunn said. Walmart's gift card policy says that lost or stolen cards will not be replaced and the company is not liable for lost or stolen cards by third parties. For consumers, the financial loss hurts. But there's also an emotional sting and that rings true for Tam. He's bummed he got ripped off by a Christmas Grinch. Here are some tips to avoid gift card scams: Don't buy gift cards from store racks. Buy gift cards online. Use your credit card when purchasing gift cards so if there's a problem, you can make a claim with your credit card company. Copyright 2017 HawaiiNewsNow. All rights reserved.

Photographer: JOHN ENGER GULFPORT -- Betty Duffey has several grocery stores vying for her business near her neighborhood in southern Pinellas County. A Publix supermarket is 2.5 miles down the road, and she'll pass by a Winn-Dixie and a Walmart Neighborhood Market on the way there. Two miles in the other direction is an Aldi and a Walmart Supercenter. But Duffey, 63, does most of her grocery shopping at Save-A-Lot. It's the closest grocery store to her house, but it's also the cheapest. "I'm on disability and really have to watch how I spend my money," Duffey said. "At Publix, I'd spend $200 a month for groceries. At Winn-Dixie, I'd spend probably around $150. But at Save-A-Lot, I'll spend $80 for the same amount of food." Save-A-Lot has operated supermarkets in Florida since the 1980s, managing mostly to fly under the radar. But in recent years, the Missouri-based discount grocery chain known for its cut-rate prices and private labels on staple items from milk to spaghetti, has moved into Florida in a big way. Save-A-Lot made a push to double its number of stores in the Southeast in 2009, and within three years opened 100 stores, including dozens more in Florida and a second distribution center. Florida is now Save-A-Lot's largest market, with more than 150 stores. The company's stores are smaller than the average Walmart or Winn-Dixie, and they're often located in older shopping centers in parts of town where Publix has avoided. Because of this, coupled with Florida's average wages still lagging behind the national average, Save-A-Lot has been able to carve out its own niche. "Groceries are relatively inelastic in that people can eat less, but they still have to buy food," said Steve Kirn, a lecturer who teaches classes on retail at the University of Florida. "Save-A-Lot is attractive because they are often the only grocery stores in a low-income market. But no matter where you live, their prices are pretty attractive." Save-A-Lot began opening stores in Florida in the mid 1980s. Most of their early locations looked like a hybrid between a grocery store and a convenience store, and were found mostly in rural communities like Plant City and Brooksville. "Our goal is to be a neighborhood grocery store, which means we serve people who live within 2 to 3 miles of the store. Not that shoppers can't come from farther away, but the model is based off providing access to groceries to those who live in a close proximity," said Chon Tomlin, spokeswoman for Save-A-Lot. "The theory is that if you have to run up the street to get a gallon of milk, we want you to come to Save-A-Lot. We'll have the lowest prices on those core, staple grocery items, and we're the closest to home." The company's business strategy has stayed the same even with its rapid growth. Save-A-Lot has opened more urban stores, including several in Tampa, St. Petersburg and Clearwater, but it still serves areas that are often considered "food deserts," or densely populated communities where it is difficult to buy affordable or good-quality fresh food. "Save-A-Lot almost has no direct competitor because its business is mostly stock dry items and the model is based on convenience and price," said Jeff Green, a retail analyst based in Phoenix. "Everyone else focuses on organics or fresh produce or customer service." Many of the shoppers who buy from the Save-A-Lot on Gulfport Boulevard in southern Pinellas walk or bike from their homes nearby. The store is in a mostly empty shopping center with a Family Dollar store next door and a handful of other independent stores. However, the Save-A-Lot store stays busy nearly all hours of the day. In a marked contrast to the atmosphere of typical suburban supermarkets, an armed security guard stands at the front of the store. "By moving into spaces where other grocery stores have closed or in lower-end centers where others won't go, Save-A-Lot is paying a pretty low rent," Kirn said. "That's part of how they make the formula work. They can remodel at a lower cost than building a brand new store." Customers won't find all the extra perks at a Save-A-Lot that they see at a Publix. There's usually only a handful of employees working at the store at a time. There are only four cash registers, though usually only two are open at a time. Shoppers have to bag their own groceries. And most goods for sale are shelved in the cardboard boxes that they were in when shipped to the store. There's no seafood department, and the meat section is very modest compared to other grocery stores. Baked goods are prepared off site and shipped to the store. "Save-A-Lot is a convenience-oriented shopping trip," said Green, the retail analyst. "It's very price-oriented, too. But it's for people shopping for a few things at a time, not a huge shopping trip, even if the number of customers they have in a day can be fairly high." This "lean efficiency" model helps keep costs down so Save-A-Lot can sell items at a greater discount, Tomlin said. "Our stores employ about 20 people, and everyone is trained to do every job instead of just being tied to one function," she added. Save-A-Lot stores don't sell the popular name brands seen in most other supermarkets, like Kellogg's cereal or Chobani yogurt. Instead, it sells its own private label on all goods, from tomato sauce to paper towels. It's another cost-cutting measure the company capitalizes on, one that has been fairly easy to do thanks to a longtime ownership by SuperValu, one of the largest wholesale grocery companies in the country. SuperValu announced in October that it will sell Save-A-Lot to Onex Corp., a Toronto-based private equity investment firm, for $1.37 billion. Unlike other grocery stores, Save-A-Lot offers its own franchise-type ownership program. About 75 percent of the company's 1,400 stores are owned by licensees, who operate the grocery store under Save-A-Lot's leadership. But Save-A-Lot's secret might be out, as competition heats up in the low-cost niche in Florida. Adli, a German discount grocery chain, is opening stores in Florida at a rapid rate. While most stores are built new from the ground up, they often serve the same of kind of communities that a Save-A-Lot or a Walmart would, and are known for their discount prices. Lidl, another German value brand, is expected to make a big push into the U.S. for the first time this year. "Some of these more traditional grocers, like Winn-Dixie and Publix, are starting to get hit on the lower end by discount stores like Save-A-Lot. It's one of the fastest growing segments of the supermarket industry, with newcomers like Adli continuing to grow and Lidl coming into the U.S.," Kirn said. He noted that Winn-Dixie's promotion to rollback prices on staple items last year was a move to keep its value-based shoppers. "There's clearly a big market here for house-branded items offered at a discount. Publix and others are going to start feeling the heat." Back in Gulfport, Duffey said she sees no reason why she'd ever stop shopping at the Save-A-Lot close to her home. "I've never bought a piece of produce that wasn't fresh, and the store is always clean," she said, adding that most of the tenants in her nearby apartment building shop there, too. "I wish they would remodel the store to make that center nicer, but it's Save-A-Lot. They're not going to, and that's okay." Contact Justine Griffin at jgriffin@tampabay.com or (727) 893-8467.

You’ll receive free e-mail news updates each time a new story is published. You’re all set! Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Fritz Hahn By Fritz Hahn Reporter January 22 Follow @fritzhahn The two beers on the left are produced by Walmart, the two on the right by Trader Joe’s. (Fritz Hahn/The Washington Post) Many beer geeks spent the end of 2016 debating their list of the year’s best releases — Voodoo’s ManBearPig imperial stout? Tree House’s King JJJuliusss double IPA? Ocelot’s Talking Backwards triple IPA? — and looking back at the rising tides of sour beers and fruit-flavored IPAs. But one of the biggest beer developments of the past 12 months is this: Walmart now sells its own “craft” beer. Go ahead and laugh. I’m assuming most beer lovers don’t spend much time thinking about the craft ales and lagers in the cooler at Walmart, especially if the selection is as mediocre as the one at my local D.C. store, where the few sixers and sampler 12-packs of Flying Dog, New Belgium and Dogfish Head are dwarfed by 30-packs of Natural Light and Tecate. But market research firm Placed Insights ranks Walmart as the most popular store in the country, with more than half of all American shoppers visiting one of the company’s 4,600 stores in a given month. That’s a lot of eyes falling on those products. Teresa Budd, a senior buyer for Walmart’s adult beverage team, says the company began to notice its craft beer sales growing a few years ago, especially compared with sales of mainstream domestic beers. The company put out an offer to suppliers around the country, seeking to produce an IPA, a pale ale, an amber ale and a Belgian-style ale, Budd says, because “those were the top four best-selling craft styles at the time.” After samplings and tastings, “making sure it’s exactly what we want,” Walmart began producing beer in “collaboration” with a company called Trouble Brewing in Rochester, N.Y. The beers launched in six-packs and a 12-can variety pack in early 2016, and they’re found in 3,000 stores across 45 states. Budd says the response from consumers has been enthusiastic, and the line may expand with new or seasonal beers in the future. Unlike the house-brand beers of some of the company’s competitors, including Costco and Trader Joe’s, Trouble Brewing offers no clue on the label to tell you that Walmart was behind its creation. A shopper heading down the aisle to look for Samuel Adams or Miller High Life might see the ersatz-hipster labels of Cat’s Away IPA and After Party Pale Ale, or the distressed fonts and “torn”-look packaging of the Pack of Trouble variety 12-pack, and assume they were made by some new craft brewery that just hit the market. It’s also hard to ignore the price: $7.96 for a six-pack and $13.86 for the variety pack. That’s $3 to $5 cheaper than other craft beers on the same shelf. Lower cost and perceived value are a competitive advantage for established store house brands: Most of Trader Joe’s “exclusive” brews, such as Mission St. IPA and JosephsBrau Bohemian Lager, cost $6.49 to $6.99 per six-pack, or $1.09 to $1.17 each for shoppers who mix and match. A 22-ounce bottle of Green Flash Fearless Fifty, an exclusive saison created by the San Diego brewery for Trader Joe’s 50th anniversary, is $5.99. At Costco, a whopping 48-pack of its Signature Light Beer costs $22. (Of course, you have to buy in bulk.) Another thing these store brands have in common is a tendency to deliberately obscure — or flat-out conceal — where the beer is coming from. In the case of Walmart, no American brewery with the name Trouble Brewing actually exists. The applicant listed on filings for the four beers with the Treasury Department’s Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) is “Winery Exchange, Inc.,” now known as WX Brands, which “develops exclusive brands of wine, beer and spirits for retailers around the world,” according to its website. The brewery address given on the TTB documents is Genesee Brewing’s business office. Genesee is not a craft brewery, which the national Brewers Association defines as small, independent and traditional; it’s owned by Costa Rica-based Florida Ice and Farm, which brews that country’s Imperial Lager and other industrial brands. Its flagship American beers, Genesee and Genesee Cream Ale, are cheap college-party staples, and it’s tough to convince people that your brand is hip and craft when those are the other products coming out of the tanks. Walmart’s Budd says there’s no intention to deceive consumers, pointing out that Walmart doesn’t put the company name on its private label brands, whether camping gear or cat food. “We were intentional about designing a package that conveyed a look and feel you’d expect of craft beer,” she said. Likewise, previous variety packs of Costco’s Kirkland Signature Handcrafted Beer, which will return to stores this spring, claimed that the IPAs and brown ales came from either New Yorker Brewer in Utica, N.Y., or Hopfen und Malz in San Jose, depending on where the beer was purchased. The TTB reveals they’re brewed at F.X. Matt (the home of Saranac) and Gordon Biersch, respectively. Trader Joe’s sources its beers from several brewers. Most German-style beers purport to be from JosephsBrau Brewing while actually being contract-brewed by Gordon Biersch; the Mission Street IPA and Session Pale Ale beers are brewed by Salt Lake City’s Four + Brewing, a pseudonym for Uinta, after years of being produced under contract at the well-respected Firestone Walker. Fat Weasel’s label says it’s brewed by “River Trent Brewing Company, Ukiah, CA,” which is actually Mendocino Brewing. And so on. Affordable beers made by breweries that most people have heard of? The only question left is “How does it taste?” I convened a team of Washington Post staffers for a blind tasting of beers purchased at Walmart and Trader Joe’s and asked them to write down their thoughts. The results were not that positive: Trouble Brewing’s Red Flag Amber Ale was described as “flabby,” “knock-you-over-the-head syrupy sweet” and “good for flip cup.” The JosephsBrau Bohemian Lager elicited “watery,” “tastes like college” and “channels a Heineken that’s been open for a little too long.” Trouble Brewing’s After Party Ale was “bland nothingness” and “lacking an identifiable taste.” The standouts, according to the testers, included JosephBrau’s Hefeweizen, which had the bright mouth feel and bubble gum and banana notes you’d expect from a German wheat beer, even as one reviewer called it “drinkable, if not particularly memorable.” The Mission St. Session Pale Ale got mixed reviews — though still better than the IPA’s — for its bitterness and citrusy hops, although it was also called “thin” and “nothing to get excited about.” Trouble Brewing’s most popular brew was ’Round Midnight Belgian White, which didn’t strike anyone as an outstanding witbier but received complements on its spice and fruitiness, as well as easy drinkability. None of those beers is going to light up online beer forums or find its way onto “Best Beer of the Year” lists, but that’s not the point. These are affordable brews that could be gateway beers for domestic beer drinkers looking to dip a toe into the world of craft beer. If they like Trouble Brewing’s version of a Belgian witbier, maybe they’ll be open to trying one from Allagash or Bell’s, or they’ll grab a six-pack of Flying Dog instead of Bud Light. Either way, Walmart just put craft-style beers in front of millions of new potential craft beer customers, which should be a positive for brewers of all sizes.

Courtesy of Wal-Mart   By Lindsey M. Roberts Special to The Washington Post Pantone selected its 2017 Color of the Year, Greenery, based on research that shows everyone just wants a big, deep breath of air. "We don't all have access to the green forest, but we do have access to things we can bring into our home environment," says Leatrice Eiseman, executive director of the Pantone Color Institute, which advises companies on color and forecasts trends. One way to do that is with this powerful color. When used on an accent wall, kitchen backsplash or throw, it will refresh and energize you. Pair it with warm whites and neutrals for a clean, tranquil vibe, or use a bright white for a fun, contemporary feel. It's especially nice in kitchens, where it's natural to want a fresh feeling, but also in entries and hallways, to transition between room colors. "It is a very optimistic color," says Lori Weitzner, a textile designer in New York and author of "Ode to Color." "Use it in the right way in your home, and it will keep your spirits high." • One of the best places to use a bright green, Weitzner says, is in the kitchen. Add plants and herbs, but also consider a green backsplash, an accent wall or even an indoor-outdoor rug. Dash & Albert's Samode Indoor/Outdoor Rug pairs a vegetal green called Sprout with a warm ivory -- and spills come out with a quick hose-down ($48-$672, dashandalbert.com). The Fargrik 18-piece dinnerware set, • Play5, brings this timeless shade of green to your kitchen table. - Kristian Krebs/Courtesy of Ikea • Play with Greenery in a small way with the Miguel Green Highball Glass ($7, crateandbarrel.com). Depending on how you set the table, the color changes like a chameleon. With bright whites, "it could be terrific and energetic," Alexandria, Virginia-based interior designer Victoria Sanchez said in an email. It could also counterbalance gray or, when paired with other brights, signal a party atmosphere. • Don't worry about this color being a mere fad. Our eyes never tire of green just as they never tire of a view of trees. Ikea's Fargrik 18-piece dinnerware set brings the timeless hue to your kitchen table ($25, ikea.com). • As Eiseman traveled the world to collect data for this year's color, she took note of people wanting a healthy diet, cooking with more herbs and embracing the green-tea powder called matcha, the color of which matches Greenery almost exactly. Sip your own green tea from the color-matching Pome Mug ($14, anthropologie.com). • "Greenery is also great to use as accents in rugs and throw pillows in an otherwise neutral room," Weitzner says. "They add uplifting energy and can elevate the mood -- without creating too much intensity." The Antibes Throw pairs the color with orange, aqua, ivory and navy ($185, lekkerhome.com). Pier 1's Frankie Cream & Green Armchair, $450, has an overscale floral pattern. - Courtesy of Pier 1 Imports • It's widespread design wisdom that the best place to try out trends is in small accessories. A classic throw or pillow for a sofa will do, but why not go for the unexpected pouf? The Hand-knit Pouf by Chandra mixes green and cream, making the pattern lively yet serene ($164, burkedecor.com). • Eiseman says she is seeing more light fixtures in vibrant shades of green. The ceramic Lauren Table Lamp, which has a traditional shape, reads contemporary in this glossy color ($129, ballarddesigns.com). • If you love Greenery but don't know where to incorporate it in your furnishings, Eiseman recommends taking an old, shabby chair and re-covering it in a solid-green or green-printed fabric. No lovelorn hand-me-down in your house? You can also buy that accent chair new. We like the overscale floral on the Frankie Cream & Green Armchair. ($450, pier1.com). • "Greenery feels hopeful, happy, new and crisp," Sanchez said. "Also, it is tying us into nature, which I believe is comforting, calm and yet upbeat, too." The tassels on the French Tassel Shower Curtain by Serena & Lily emphasize the playfulness of the color ($78, serenaandlily.com). • Weitzner would pair Greenery with other fun colors, such as melon, lavender and sunny yellow, but she'd do it in small doses. "These happy and curious colors are easy to live with in small amounts," she says. "They are not too sweet nor too saturated." Bold color doesn't come in a smaller dose than on the hands of the Newgate Cubic Grey and White Alarm Table Clock ($40, cb2.com). The Hand-Knitted Pouf by Chandra, photo664, mixes green and cream, making the pattern lively yet serene. - Courtesy of Burke Decor • Greenery is more of a new-leaf green, not the deeper green of plants in summer, Weitzner says. Build on that springy feeling by potting houseplants in the Better Homes and Gardens Mumbai Decorative Planter ($30 for a set of two, walmart.com). • Weitzner knows designers who love plastering a bright green on all four walls of a room. That can be too much for a bedroom, though, so try some fresh green bedding instead. The Parker Green Duvet's preppy white stripes are a fun touch ($194-$262, pineconehill.com).

The world’s biggest retailer said Tuesday that its plans will also generate about 24,000 construction jobs. The jobs will come from the opening of 59 new, expanded and relocated Wal-Mart and Sam’s Club locations as well as e-commerce services that were previously announced. Wal-Mart is opening fewer stores this year, but still adding jobs as it offers more positions in online grocery pickup, trainers for its new academies for hourly workers and construction jobs for remodels. The rate is consistent with previous hiring in recent years, says Lorenzo Lopez, a Wal-Mart spokesman. Media reports have also said, however, that Wal-Mart plans to cut hundreds or even about 1,000 jobs at its corporate headquarters by the end of the month. Wal-Mart typically announces job plans early in the year, analysts say. Tuesday’s announcement marks the latest in a series of announcements from companies that may want to get into the good graces of President-elect Donald Trump, who will be taking office on Friday and has called out companies for not keeping jobs in the U.S., analysts say. “Everyone is trying to curry favor with the new administration in terms of getting a better corporate tax landscape and gaining favor with the new administration,” said Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics LLC, a research firm. General Motors announced plans Tuesday to invest $1 billion in U.S. factories and hire thousands of new white-collar jobs, moves that have been in the works for years but were made public after attacks from Trump. Amazon.com announced last week that it would add 100,000 full-time jobs over the next 18 months. The increased hiring was tied to already-announced plans to build more distribution centers and other facilities. Amazon said its U.S. workforce has grown from 30,000 in 2011 to more than 180,000 by the end of this year. By comparison, Wal-Mart employs about 2.4 million people worldwide, including 1.5 million in the United States. Trump thanked General Motors and Wal-Mart on Twitter for “starting the big push back in the U.S.” and took credit for bringing jobs “back into the U.S.” However, Wal-Mart store jobs and construction wouldn’t have moved elsewhere anyway. Wal-Mart has been looking to trim costs and expenses as it tries to be more nimble and compete better with Amazon. It announced early last year it would close 154 U.S. store locations, and this summer eliminated 7,000 back-office positions. Other retailers have recently announced store closings and layoffs. Macy’s, for example, is closing nearly 70 stores, cutting 10,000 jobs. (Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

H&R Block, Jackson Hewitt and others are fighting for market share and trying to lock in customers who might otherwise turn to an online competitor, like TurboTax. The strategy is to heavily market easy money loans for a limited time — typically through February — to struggling tax filers who benefit from the earned income tax credit but now face added delays for early refund money. Consumers who might receive refunds of $4,000 or more thanks to the earned income tax credit now are told not to expect refund money until Feb. 27, a few weeks later than usual. Experts say early filers still should file in January and February, like usual, as waiting might drag out the process even more. The zero percent pitches come at a time when the working poor and moderate-­income families are particularly vulnerable because they turn to early tax refunds to cover winter heating bills and other expenses. “They expect refunds at a certain time,” said Chi Chi Wu, staff attorney for the National Consumer Law Center. “These are families who can use every penny they can get.” But the rules changed this tax season, thanks to a push in Congress to combat fraud and crooks who steal IDs to file fake tax returns that tap into generous tax credits, like the EITC, to rip off the federal government. H&R Block estimates some 15 million tax filers who receive the EITC and often file early could face delays. “With this client, there are real needs for cash,” said William Cobb, CEO of H&R Block. Last week, H&R Block rolled out its Refund Advance product, which is being pitched as a zero percent interest loan with no finance charges. The H&R Block tax-related loan will be made in the amounts of $500, $750, or $1,250 upfront, based on the eligibility of the client. Refund Advance is offered by H&R Block through a partnership with MetaBank, a federal savings bank based in Sioux Falls, S.D., which can provide up to $1.6 billion of such loans to H&R Block customers. The loan itself is available if the tax filer is projected to have a tax refund of at least $1,000. The H&R Block loan is available only in H&R Block offices, not online. “We’re driven to get more clients,” Cobb said. “This is about as consumer-friendly as you can get.” Refunds will be later This tax season, many tax filers on the edge could very well take a second look at such products. Beginning this year, the IRS by law cannot release tax refunds for returns that claim earned income tax credit or the additional child tax credit until Feb. 15. The Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 — known as the PATH Act — put these extra hurdles into place as a way to combat fraud and ID theft. Realistically, tax experts say it could be until Feb. 27 or so by the time many early tax filers receive their refund cash. It’s not a small point for many families. “For most Americans who file in January and February, they really rely on their refund as one of their biggest checks of the year,” said David Prokupek, CEO of Jackson Hewitt. Prokupek said some $50 billion of refunds could be delayed as a result of the new law and many consumers will want some product to deal with those kind of numbers. “No one has that much spare change lying around,” Prokupek said. Jackson Hewitt’s Express Refund Advance is marketed as a loan with no fees, a zero percent annual percentage rate and no credit check. Jackson Hewitt’s Express Refund Advance offers loans in amounts of $250, $500, $750, $1,000 and $1,300 — again depending on what the customer is approved for by MetaBank. For example, someone who is likely to get a $500 tax refund might qualify for a $250 advance. Jackson Hewitt kicked off its tax season in late November by offering a way for taxpayers to prequalify for an Express Refund Advance by answering a few questions on www.ExpressRefundAdvance.com. Early loans could even be granted with just a pay stub — not W-2s, which are to be out by Jan. 31. Shoppers at Walmart — Jackson Hewitt has tax service operations in 3,000 Walmart stores — are seeing signs in the store promoting the new refund advance product. Again, the advance loans are only available if you go to a Walmart location or one of Jackson Hewitt’s storefronts. You cannot obtain the loans online. “Handing out money over the Internet without seeing your face or ID is not something we want to do,” Prokupek said. To get the loan, you will have to pay to file your taxes with Jackson Hewitt. And if you take out a refund advance at H&R Block, you’d have to file your taxes with H&R Block. The advances would be repaid with actual tax refund money when that’s issued. If you qualify for the Jackson Hewitt advance product, customers can receive the money via direct deposit or loaded onto an American Express Serve Card at no charge. One promotion offers customers who opt for the American Express prepaid card a $50 Walmart gift card. “Consumers are spending their refund dollars at Walmart,” Prokupek said. With the American Express Serve card, consumers can withdraw cash for free at MoneyPass-branded ATMs, which are listed online at www.moneypass.com. Consumers would pay a $3.50 American Express Serve fee for withdrawing cash at non-MoneyPass ATMs. And it’s possible that the ATM operator may also charge a fee. The H&R Block loan is loaded onto an H&R Block Emerald Prepaid MasterCard. You’d pay a $3 fee at ATMs for withdrawing cash. You can avoid added surcharge fees by getting cash at MoneyPass ATMs or Allpoint ATMs in 7-Eleven and CVS stores. Ask before you sign up So what are the questions consumers need to ask, if they’re tempted by zero percent refund advances? One concern: How much will tax preparation services cost you? Financially strapped tax filers could be tempted to pay up to a few hundred dollars or so for tax preparation services instead of using free services, if they want to gain access to advance loans. Tax filers who qualify for the earned income tax credit risk forgoing free tax preparation services via volunteer tax assistance programs, such as those offered by AARP and the Accounting Aid Society. In addition, the Internal Revenue Service estimates that 70 percent of the nation’s taxpayers are eligible for IRS Free File where software is available to those with incomes of $64,000 or less. See www.irs.gov. “A taxpayer should ask about the costs involved with their tax preparation and any related products offered so they can make informed decisions,” said Marshall Hunt, certified public accountant and director of tax policy for the Accounting Aid Society’s tax assistance program in Detroit. Other potential costs: How much will it cost you to get your money via a prepaid card? While many cards offer services with no fees, review potential fees with the card, including what it would cost you to go to an ATM to get money. If you don’t use one of these prepaid cards for two months or so, you could be hit with inactivity fees each month.

A spokesperson for Walmart told NJ Advance Media said the company will remodel a dozen New Jersey locations, and a source told NJBIZ it is building three supercenters in the state. It was unclear how many new jobs will be added in the state. Our take: Coming on the heels of the closing of many retail outlets (and many more are coming), it’s good to see one giant is growing its workforce. Big Data deal Nine of the state’s top colleges and universities have signed a memorandum of agreement to formally establish the New Jersey Big Data Alliance. Margaret Brennan-Tonetta, associate vice president for economic development at Rutgers and a founder of the NJBDA, said the agreement was a step toward making the Garden State a leader in an emerging field. Our take: This could be one of the biggest announcements of the year. Big Data is everything. If the state’s centers for higher education can come together to make New Jersey a national leader, lots of students, money and jobs are sure to follow. Tough holiday It wasn’t too jolly this holiday season for Wayne-based retailer Toys R Us Inc., which said last week that same-store sales fell for the nine weeks ended Dec. 31, 2016. The company said same-store sales fell 2.5 percent domestically and 4.9 percent internationally, for an overall 3.4 percent decline from the previous year. Same-store sales are a key retail measuring stick. Our take: Toys R Us is a poster child for large retailers attempting to change their business model to meet the ever-growing commerce challenges.  Each week in Face Time, NJBIZ editors approximate Chris Christie's mood and facial expressions based on the news. FACETIME: BACK IN GOOD GRACES? President Donald Trump had some kind words for Gov. Chris Christie: “At some point, we’re going to do something with Chris,” Trump told a reporters last week. “Don’t forget: We have a lot of positions. There are a lot of positions, and the positions come up again. Because when they’re filled, somebody stays for eight years, somebody stays for two years — you never know. But we’ll be involved with Chris. Chris is a friend of mine. Chris is a great guy.” xx Also Popular on NJBIZ • Hackensack Meridian exec named chairman of N.J.

The world’s biggest retailer said Tuesday that its plans will also generate about 24,000 construction jobs. The jobs will come from the opening of 59 new, expanded and relocated Wal-Mart and Sam’s Club locations as well as e-commerce services that were previously announced.

And Amazon.com announced last week that it would add 100,000 full-time jobs over the next 18 months. The increased hiring was tied to already-announced plans to build more distribution centers and other facilities. Amazon said its U.S. workforce has grown from 30,000 in 2011 to more than 180,000 by the end of this year. By comparison, Wal-Mart employs about 2.4 million people worldwide, including 1.5 million in the United States. Trump thanked General Motors and Wal-Mart on Twitter for “starting the big push back in the U.S.” and took credit for bringing jobs “back into the U.S.” However, Wal-Mart store jobs and construction wouldn’t have moved elsewhere anyway. Wal-Mart has been looking to trim costs and expenses as it tries to be more nimble and compete better with Amazon. It announced early last year it would close 154 U.S. store locations, and this summer eliminated 7,000 back-office positions. Other retailers have recently announced store closings and layoffs. Macy’s, for example, is closing nearly 70 stores, cutting 10,000 jobs.

Photo / Facebook She's the woman who appeared in a viral internet meme that was shared across the world. But now Jennifer Knapp Wilkinson has revealed the truth behind an image that captured her falling off a motorised scooter in Walmart. The image appeared on an online page ridiculing Walmart customers called People of Walmart. Now, four years after the picture was taken, Knapp Wilkinson has spoken about that day and shared the shocking impact the humiliating experience had on her, saying: "It is never just harmless fun to laugh at someone." The 39-year-old mum of two says she is still suffering from obesity and struggles to lose weight because of her spinal condition, anxiety, ADHD and post-traumatic stress disorder. Speaking to Daily Mail, Knapp Wilkinson, from Missouri, said she only found out about the photo after her sister found it and asked if it was her. She then scrolled through hundreds of cruel comments that poked fun at her obesity. "The worst thing about this photo is that people think a fat woman tipped over a cart because she was too lazy to get out of the cart to get the case of soda," Knapp Wilkinson wrote in a candid post on Quora. "I have a condition in my spine called Spondylolisthesis. The most common symptoms in the legs include a feeling of vague weakness associated with prolonged standing or walking. Continued below.

I have been known to fall because of this condition." Knapp Wilkinson was grocery shopping for her husband Robert when she fell off her scooter and was in enormous pain "My parents had a form of this disease and had to have back surgeries in their early 30s. So there is a good chance my children can get the same spine disease," she said. She shamed bullies for assuming her obesity was because of "laziness", saying the photo was now an eternal reminder of a "low point" in her life. She said, "I was at a very low point in my mental health. I also was experiencing a lot of pain and weakness that day. I took a cart because I was grocery shopping for my family. I went to get a case of soda for my husband. "I thought I saw a flash of light and heard some young girls giggling. I thought nothing of it because I am use to hearing people make fun of me or saying snide remarks. It was nothing new. "I have also seen this photo attached to stories that aren't even true about this situation," she went on. The stay-at-home mum said she wanted people to know "fat people are people too" and wants "compassion, understanding, and respect as a fellow human being". "You cannot see my disabilities but they are there and they are real. So next time you see photos making fun of people just remember you know nothing about these people or the struggles they face every day," she added.

 This French startup is trying to take away one of Amazon's crucial advantages over small businesses Rob Price Jan. 22, 2017, 7:57 AM 9,284 facebook linkedin twitter email print Logistics. It's pretty freaking important.Pablo Blazquez Dominguez/Getty Images LONDON — Amazon is a juggernaut. It is bigger than Wal-Mart, and tens of millions of people subscribe to its Amazon Prime premium service. And this huge size helps reinforce its dominance, allowing it to offer a huge selection of items at cheap prices. Even if smaller businesses can compete with its product range in narrow fields, it's hard to keep up with it in other areas — like delivery, where the Seattle company offers relatively speedy free delivery, free one-day delivery for its Prime subscribers, and even one-hour delivery on certain items. Wing, a French logistics startup, is trying to tackle this. It offers a delivery service to small and medium businesses, helping them to compete on similar footing to Amazon, and counts luxury brand Chanel, premium speaker company Devialet, and glasses company Bailey Nelson as customers. "Amazon and the other industry leaders have set an incredible pace in the logistics industry in the past few years, accustoming customers to fast and cheap delivery," cofounder Edouard Caraco told Business Insider. "Our aim is to allow SMB's [small and medium businesses] to compete with these standards and turn their logistics into a competitive advantage." Wing doesn't actually own its own logistics network — keeping it small Wing first launched in France in December 2015 and expanded into Britain in February 2016, with its British operation managed by cofounders Edouard Caraco and Tim Linyer. The startup has shipped more than 100,000 parcels for 200 clients — and December 2016 was its busiest month yet, Caraco says. Around a third of parcels and clients are currently in the UK. Unlike delivery companies like Hermes and DHL, Wing doesn't actually own its own logistics network. Instead, it just takes advantage of economies of scale to negotiate a better deal with existing logistics networks and takes a fee — allowing it to stay lean. Across both countries, it has 28 staff — 8 in London, and 20 in France. From the merchant's perspective, it handles everything — collecting and packing the items, getting them a good price, and providing a dashboard to manage the deliveries. It offers standard, express, and one-hour deliveries — letting them compete with the likes of Amazon Prime Now, Amazon's one-hour delivery service. (It also manages returns, picking up the items directly from the customers.) A small boutique clothes shop might struggle with the logistics and cost of organising same-day delivery itself, or working directly with a major courier, but Wing does all that heavy lifting for them. In short: It's a clever middle man that inserts itself into the delivery process and takes a tidy cut for itself for its trouble. There is significant expansion planned for 2017 Right now, Wing is available in Paris and Bordeaux in France, and in the UK it is in London and Brighton — which it launched in January 2017. Tim Linyer (left) and Edouard Caraco.Wing It has further expansion planned, including more French and British cities, and possibly Spain "before the end of 2017." The firm is in the process of raising a Series A funding round, after €1.2 million in earlier seed funding, and also has partnerships with larger e-commerce sites in the works, says Caraco, who previously worked for Amazon in its marketplace department. "We are working hand in hand with e-leaders to help them solve their urban logistics challenges (returns, same-day, ship from store). We are currently in beta testing with very large retailers and e-commerce websites and will officially launch these services by end of Q1 2017!" The lack of its own infrastructure makes it vulnerable and dependent on its partners — but it also keeps costs low. By the end of the year, Caraco expects the UK business to be profitable, and Wing's French arm is aiming for profitability by the third quarter of 2017.

H&N photo by Kevin N. Hume Amy Bender, coordinator for the Backpack Meal program at the YMCA at Fairview, places boxes filled with food bags in the back of a van to deliver to Pelican Elementary School students on Friday. As the YMCA van pulls into the parking lot outside Pelican Elementary School on Friday afternoons, five fifth-graders run outside to collect the bags of food from inside the van and distribute them throughout the school. The bags are part of the “Backpack Meal Program,” which provides students with six meals for the weekend, including two breakfasts, two lunches and two dinners. As the bags are placed inside the classrooms, students look up and smile, knowing that they won’t go hungry over the weekend. When Renea Wood became Program Development Director at the YMCA of Klamath Falls seven years ago, her mission was to create a year-round food program for students. During the school year, the Free and Reduced Lunch program provides numerous students with breakfast and lunch during the week, but on the weekends students have access to the food their parents provide, and for some that means going hungry. Story continues below video × Advertisement “Our community is in really high need when it comes to child hunger and food insecurity,” Wood said. Student need The YMCA kick-started the Backpack Meal Program in October, 2013 with an initial grant from the Walmart Foundation and help from the United Family Fellowship, which donated office space and volunteers. The program was first introduced at Conger Elementary School, based on data from the Oregon Department of Education that showed 80 to 90 percent of students using the Free and Reduced Lunch program. During the first year, the program served 45 students at Conger, delivering 881 bags of food. The following year, 122 students signed up and received 3,047 bags of food. The program expanded to Pelican in 2015 and served both schools with 4,177 bags of food. The program has since expanded to Mills, where 94.5 percent of students use the Free and Reduced Lunch program. During the first eight weeks of the 2016 school year, the Backpack Meal Program served 353 students at all three schools with 2,738 bags of food for the weekend. Funding search Wood continues to search for funding and grants “here and there” and also relies on donations from the community. The Klamath Falls First United Methodist Church donates whenever they have change for funds, Wood said, and the YMCA also hosts various events including canned food drives, but cash dollars have been the hardest thing to come by. This year, the Backpack Meal Program was recognized by the Child Hunger Coalition of Klamath County, which provided a level of funding for the school year. The YMCA also received a $75,000 grant from the Walmart State Giving foundation for its “Park and Play” summer lunch program, as well as the Backpack Meal Program, which allowed for its expansion. “This year I’m looking into ways to make [the program] truly sustainable,” Wood said. “It’s getting bigger now and I’m worried it can’t keep going with limited funds and it needs to be a standalone project.” Although Wood coined the term “Backpack Meal Program” in Klamath Falls, the idea itself is part of a national incentive to end child hunger nationwide. Wood said she got the idea from other YMCAs that were doing the same thing and also received advice from a similar program in Portland. A month at a time Backpack Meal Program Coordinator Amy Bender runs the day-to-day operations of the program by ordering and collecting the food, coordinating the volunteers and scheduling delivery days. Bender orders a month’s worth of food at one time, she said, which is stored on racks and shelves inside a room at the YMCA at Fairview. While Bender utilizes the Klamath-Lake Counties Food Bank, she said the program receives a better discount at Sherm’s Thunderbird market. On average, the cost of filling a child’s bag each week is $2. Before the students at Pelican volunteered to distribute the bags, Bender was considered the “bag lady” and as she walked into the classrooms, she said students would recognize her and acknowledge that it was Friday, meaning they were going home with food for the weekend. “The excitement of getting something that’s theirs means a lot to them,” she said. “They can’t wait to see us.” ‘Being rich’ As a parent, Bender said she understands the idea of “being rich” at the beginning of the month with ample food stamps, and by the middle of the month “scraping” by for every meal. “A lot of kids do the after school programs so they can eat,” she said. “Then they starve on the weekends.” Once a week Bender works with volunteers from the community and Dragonfly Transitions, an aftercare program for young adults, to pre-pack 400 Sherm’s Thunderbird grocery bags with two packets of oatmeal, applesauce, Top Ramen noodles, mac and cheese, breakfast bars, among other items depending on what’s in stock. The bags are tagged with the student’s name, teacher, school and any allergies. They are then boxed depending on which school they are being delivered to. Principal partnership From the outset, Wood said she wanted to create as little disturbance and chaos as possible within the schools and works closely with the principals to organize the deliveries and ensure a smooth distribution process. At Pelican around 80 students are signed up for the Backpack Meal Program, almost 30 percent of the school, Pelican Principle Tony Swan said, and the number has increased over the years. “This program is wonderful and the volunteers are amazing people who are very generous,” he said. “There is community collaboration to help families and I love that it provides easier access and has removed barriers.” Swan pointed out that unlike other programs with registration restrictions and background checks, there are no hoops to jump through to register for the Backpack Meal Program, all that’s needed is the parent’s signature and any student in the school can sign up. “I like knowing that we are providing one more opportunity for families to take care of their children,” he said. Swan knows the families and the students at Pelican well and said if he sees a family struggling, he will suggest the Backpack Meal Program to them. The program also reinforces comradery and friendship among the students, Swan said, and is discreet. ‘Makes you happy’ Pelican fifth-grader, Molly Wilson, is one of the students who distributes the bags around the school and said the program “makes you happy you’re doing things for nice people.” Over the years, Wood said families in need don’t look the same as they used to. While there is a stigma that the program only serves low-income families, that is not the case. “It could be that both parents are working and trying to get by. By the end of the month things are hard,” she said. “It’s not just for those on welfare or the unemployed, it’s the working families, too. There are lots of people who could use extra help.” The program has come a long way since 2013, and Wood doesn’t see it stopping anytime soon. While food insecurity remains a “hot button,” there are numerous opportunities nationally to apply for federal funding. “I want to continue as long as possible,” she said. “Until the community turns around and says they no longer need assistance, I see it expanding.” As a parent, Backpack Meal Program Coordinator Amy Bender said she understands the idea of “being rich” at the beginning of the month with ample food stamps, and by the middle of the month “scraping” by for every meal. “A lot of kids do the after school programs so they can eat. Then they starve on the weekends.” Tags Ymca Backpack Meal Program Conger Elementary School Mills Elementary School Pelican Elementary School Meals Food Students Renea Wood Amy Bender Community Outreach Walmart Foundation Student School Commerce Politics Tony Swan Lunch Program Volunteer Trending Assault victim dies from his injuries Drivers unlikely to be cited after spewing fumes at local march Man charged with assault after home break-in Second suspect arrested in home invasion beating Three sentenced for drug offenses in Klamath County Video Highlights Video Klamath Countdown: Friday, Jan. 27, 2017 Jan 26, 2017 The Klamath Countdown is a weekly video news program produced by the Herald and News covering some of the top stories affecting Klamath County and the surrounding area.

Davidson pointed to homegrown success stories like Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and former President Bill Clinton as proof that an international brand could start and thrive here. Strong Suit -- which has a line of clothing ranging from shirts and ties to tuxedos -- now is sold in more than 20 Nordstrom locations and several men's specialty stores across the United States. Sales topped $1.3 million in 2016 and revenue has grown each year. Actors including Milla Jovovich, Jon Hamm, David Oyewolo and Ty Burrell have worn Strong Suit in TV appearances and on Hollywood red carpets. Even with the success, Davidson admits that the business hasn't grown quite like he'd envisioned. He points to a lack of local investors willing to put money into something other than real estate or medicine as an impediment not just for Strong Suit, but for future entrepreneurs who want to build a national brand in Little Rock. Davidson's strong ties to the city -- his architect grandfather, Julian, was the Davidson in Wittenberg, Delony & Davidson -- keep him committed to Little Rock. Strong Suit's headquarters remain in the River Market, and when he is not on the road, Davidson lives in the Heights home his grandparents built in the 1960s. During a recent break in his travel schedule Davidson sat for a Q&A. We discussed the growth of Strong Suit, impediments for entrepreneurs in central Arkansas, the state of the retail clothing industry and his recent role as a producer for Dayveon , a film by Little Rock's Amman Abbasi that recently opened the Sundance Film Festival. Below is a transcript of the conversation edited for space and clarity. When you launched Strong Suit you were convinced that a major clothing brand could be built from Little Rock. Do you still believe that? Well, if this was strictly a business calculation, the last place I'd tell anybody to start a business in Arkansas is Little Rock. But I have strong ties to this city. We've financed the entire business on $1.4 million and the fact of the matter is, save for about 5 percent, every dime we have gotten has come from out of state. Little Rock has no startup community. If you want to start something and want to stay in Arkansas, go to Northwest Arkansas. They have an investor class that is looking very forward. ... We have no cohesive vision here. We need collaboration between Little Rock and North Little Rock that doesn't exist. ... And I think, unfairly, anytime anybody starts talking about investment in Little Rock, people automatically think about Warren Stephens. I think it's really unfair to put it all on one guy to do all the things that need to be done. So somebody, some group of people -- the investor class -- has to take a much more active look at the future and not just look at things like real estate and medical technology. Retail is rapidly changing. We see it playing out in store closures and layoffs. How prepared were you for navigating that? It's the whole reason I started the business. We saw a white space, which we haven't been able to exploit as effectively as I'd like because it takes money. For [millennial customers] shopping is not a hobby. It is not a sport. It serves an immediate purpose. They want a value proposition. They're buying with intent and typically know what they are going to buy before they walk into a store, so the behavior is completely different. What they are buying is different. What stores do not understand is they are not in the business of selling stuff. They are in the business of providing an amazing experience. ... If you own any business with four walls and your concern is not "what is the experience people are going to have in here?" you probably are not going to be around that long. You have to give people a reason to get out of the house and come to the store. ... Anthropologie, to me, is the model of a store that provides a great experience with unique product. In addition to Strong Suit, you've also gotten involved in movie production. How did that come about? Amman Abbasi is one of my closest friends in Little Rock and when we first got to be friends he had started his career in filmmaking. One of my best friends is a movie director [and Little Rock native], David Gordon Green. For years I was pressuring David to hire Amman, and about three years ago he finally acquiesced. He saw what I saw in Amman, which is a unique talent and unique point of view. ... Amman had a story he wanted to tell and he put a little money into it, I put a little money into it. Through my friend David and through the network Amman built he brought on people who are real producers, people who are much bigger names and have written much bigger checks than me. Is movie production something you hope to do more of? Is it a good investment? I love movies. I've always loved movies. The movie business, though, is a lot like horse racing. People don't invest in movies because they want to make money. People invest in horses because they want to go to the races. I don't know how many people actually expect to make money off of horse racing. So this is not a for-profit venture at all, it's just a process I really enjoy. I love the creativity of it. I have a lot of friends in the movie business and I love being involved as much as anything. ... I've got a couple stories I think are really interesting that I think we can tell. The trick for independent film is: What's the cheapest way you can tell a story? *** When I was an 18-year-old college freshman at Arkansas State, my adviser, Joel Gambill, called me into his office to ask if I'd ever considered writing for the local daily newspaper. I assumed he meant after I graduated, but Gambill actually meant that month. My professional reporting career began in May 1996. It's something I've devoted more than half of my life to, and reporting and writing a column for the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette has been, corny as this might sound, genuinely a dream come true. That said, after nearly 21 years in this profession, it's time for a new challenge. Thanks for reading all these years. Please continue to support quality newspapers like this one because we need them now more than ever.

Stewart Ave., about an hour after a man pulled a gun while in line at the Money Center on Jan. 21, 2017. (Grace Wong / Chicago Tribune) Rosemary Regina Sobol and Grace WongContact ReportersChicago Tribune A man pulled a gun inside a crowded Walmart on the South Side on Saturday night during an apparent attempted robbery, according to police and a staffer. Officers were called to the Walmart at 8331 S. Stewart Ave. in the West Chatham neighborhood about 8:15 p.m., according to police. No injuries have been reported, police said. A cashier at the Walmart said a man wearing a red jacket and blue jeans entered the store and was in the line at the Money Center when he suddenly brandished a gun and apparently tried to rob another customer in the line. He did not shoot the gun and ran away after pulling it out, she said. Police officers rushed in and searched the store as frightened staffers and patrons tried to run out.  “Everybody ran; it was real crowded in the store,’’ the cashier said. “It made everybody freak out because that's dangerous – there was babies in line at the front registers ... people with kids shopping ... were tripping over each other,'' she said. “No one’s shot,’’ she said. “Everyone’s OK,’’ the cashier said. Serena Brown, 20, of Englewood, said she was in the customer service area with her baby cousin in his stroller when a woman ran past her toward the back of the store yelling, "He got a gun! He got a gun!" Walmart Grace Wong / Chicago Tribune The scene outside Walmart, 8331 S. Stewart Ave., where a man pulled a gun during an apparent attempted robbery on Jan. 21, 2017. The scene outside Walmart, 8331 S. Stewart Ave., where a man pulled a gun during an apparent attempted robbery on Jan. 21, 2017. (Grace Wong / Chicago Tribune) Brown also ran toward the back of the store. She said she didn't hear any gunshots, but there were a few people screaming. "It was a normal Walmart day; it was busy," Brown said.  Brown's cousin, Terry Brown, 47, of Englewood, who was in a self-checkout line, said she heard a lot of commotion and saw people dropping to the ground. Her first instinct was to find her cousin, so she ran outside.  "I'm all shook up, I'm still shook up," Terry Brown said. "We thinking we won't be back over here." Their young cousin didn't wake up during the incident. After the family left the store and crossed the street, he was still sleeping in his stroller. "He slept through the whole thing," Serena Brown said, chuckling. "If he had woke up crying, I don't know what I would have did." Police were reviewing video surveillance form the Money Center.

After its first reveal, rumors and discussions about the console spread like wildfire. Since January 13th, it seems that every hardcore fan has tried to get their hands on it. We already know it’s going to be hard to find a Nintendo Switch in stock. Advertisement Some have said that they expected a lukewarm reception to the Nintendo Switch. The replacement for Nintendo’s Wii U, Switch mixes the last two generations of the company’s gaming experience into one and throws in some mobile gaming features for good measure. At its core, it’s a 6.2-inch touchscreen tablet with NVIDIA graphics inside. When docked, it behaves like any other living room console. It’s going to be hard to find the Nintendo Switch in stock, it seems. The key to the Nintendo Switch’s potential success is that it’s not really a living room gaming console at all. Two controllers – called Joy-Cons can be attached to either side of the device. Gamers then lift it out of its dock and continue to play their favorite games. Basically, buyers get a decent mobile gaming console and a Nintendo experience for their television set within one $299.99 purchase. Advertisement How to Find the Nintendo Switch in Stock: Why Pre-Ordering is Important Before getting into how to find a Nintendo Switch in stock, understanding how we all got here is essential. Tutorials on how to finding the Nintendo Switch in stock are necessary because Nintendo has a long reputation of being very bad with new hardware launches. Advertisement Read: Nintendo Switch Buying Guide: Bundles, Games & Accessories The issues that crop up aren’t necessarily because of the hardware itself, but due to how Nintendo sells its hardware. The Wii was sold out for months. You simply couldn’t find them at all, no matter where you looked. Eventually stock eased up, but not before some people had spent three to four times the retail price of the console, just to give one as a gift. Wii U suffered from some of the same stock issues. 2016’s launch of the NES Classic has renewed fears that Nintendo routinely underestimates how many devices it’s going to sell. The device quickly sold out after launch, and has been hard to find since. On January 16, video game retailer GameStop added to fears of a complete sell out of the console on release day. Advertisement “GameStop, a family of specialty retail brands that makes the most popular technologies affordable and simple, has reserved all of its first allotment of Nintendo Switch systems,” a press release from the company began. It’s not sure when it’ll have more to offer to shoppers. How to Find the Nintendo Switch in Stock: Amazon, GameStop and Other Retailers Amazon, GameStop, Target and Wal-Mart all began their Nintendo Switch pre-order sales on January 13th, the same morning all was revealed about the console. Wal-Mart was the first to go. Best Buy and Target later joined the fray. By the time Amazon and GameStop were offering pre-orders, it was hard to find the Nintendo Switch in stock at any of the other retailers. Everyone that didn’t have a pre-order yet, flooded those sites. Despite the huge sell-out, there are some tricks to getting one as soon as it’s available. First, try looking for both the Nintendo Switch bundles. There are two bundles, one with neon Joy-Cons and another with grey Joy-Cons. The grey seems to be the least popular. Read: Nintendo Switch Pre-Orders Breakdown: What You Need to Know Advertisement Amazon will let you register for an email alert that’ll come the moment you can purchase the device again. Wal-Mart allows for in-stock alerts too. Best Buy has a system that does the same thing, just click the Notify Me When Available button on its store pages. Stock Updates For now, Target still has pre-orders of the Nintendo Switch Neon Joy-Con bundle. There’s no telling how long that’ll last. The company is sold out of the bundles with grey Joy-Cons. For now, don’t bother visiting GameStop’s stores for Nintendo Switch pre-orders. The company confirms in a recent press release sent to Gotta Be Mobile that they’re sold out for now. There are reports of some Wal-Mart stores still taking pre-orders with a deposit of around $32. Call ahead to your local store to see if they’re still doing this at your location. How to Find the Nintendo Switch in Stock: eBay, Craigslist & Other Resellers Of course, when any system is broken, people create their own. Lots of enterprising users placed a Nintendo Switch pre-order so that they could resell if it became hard to find the Nintendo Switch in stock. Some of these people are ready to make deals online. A quick check of your local Craigslist site should yield a few pre-orders. There, pre-orders seem to be hovering between $500 and $600. eBay has users offering up their pre-orders to the highest bidder too. There, they’re going for as high as $650. Advertisement How to Find the Nintendo Switch in Stock: Tracking Tool NowInStock’s Nintendo Switch tracking tool. The easiest way to find the Nintendo Switch in stock at any retailer is to use a stock tracking tool called NowInStock. The site links you directly to the listings of a half-dozen retailers. It’s updated multiple times a day too. Read: 3 Reasons to Buy a Nintendo Switch, 2 Reasons Not To Good luck trying to find the Nintendo Switch in stock. Here’s to hoping you’re able to lock one down before release day. If you aren’t able to find one, it may be better to hold off anyway.  Nintendo should have more to sell throughout 2017 and beyond. Only four games, Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild, Skylanders Imaginators, Just Dance 2017 and 1-2 Switch will be available on launch day. 17 Nintendo Switch Features You’ll Love & Some You Won’t Play Games in the Living Room   1 / 17 When docked, the Nintendo Switch allows anyone to play their video games when connected to a high-definition television. In that way, the device is every bit the replacement for the Nintendo Wii U that we were expecting. Nintendo even describes it as a home entertainment console in its early marketing materials.   1 / 17 Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

By JILLIAN WARD, The World Published: January 22, 2017, 9:12 PM A   A COOS BAY, Ore. — It’s time to close the gender gap. One of the largest gaps is in one of the most high-demand and well-paid careers: computer science. Girls Who Code is a club dedicated to evening out the playing field and now it is coming to Coos Bay. “Currently women pose only 18 percent of the computer science field,” said Cayce Hill, youth liaison for Southwestern Oregon Workforce Investment Board, and also a senior at Marshfield High School. “By 2020 there will be 1.4 million job openings and women will only fill 3 percent of that demand. That’s worse than it was in the 1980s, and that gap is growing larger.” SOWIB picked up the program to bring it here after program manager Kyle Stevens saw a presentation. It was something he knew needed to be local, reported The World. “The closest Girls Who Code club to us was in Newport,” Stevens said. “That’s just too far away, and we have youth here who would definitely benefit from it.” The target number for attendees is 20, and so far almost 15 have signed up. To raise money for the club to get started, Hill initially wrote grants, which has brought in $5,000 from the Jordan Cove Energy Project and $750 from Walmart. “We have several thousands of dollars in grants currently pending,” he added. “Being involved in this feels good because it’s difficult to get educational programs here. Some say there’s not a large enough population to sustain it, but we think we should be giving opportunities to our youth to make sure everyone has an equal shot.” The Girls Who Code club has identified a high interest in computer science coding in girls between 6th and 8th grades, but that the interest drops when they reach high school. “We want to educate them at that early age so they can stay interested and close the gender gap,” Hill said. “Being a boy and involved in this project has been interesting, but I think it’s important for there to be diversity in every aspect of life. We get stronger from diversity.” The first meeting was Jan. 17 in Coos Bay. Leading the weekly classes, which will last until June, is Samantha Buckley, the public health emergency preparedness coordinator for Coos Health and Wellness. Buckley got involved in the project because of the club’s emphasis on sisterhood and education. “It’s important for girls to stick together and support each other,” she said. “Also, every week there is a thing featuring women in the tech world. Women in general in power positions don’t get a lot of attentions unless they are beautiful, so examples of what young girls don’t typically see is great.” It doesn’t cost to attend the weekly meetings, and for students who can’t afford to buy a laptop, then one will be provided. “No one who wants to be involved will be kept from participating in any way,” Hill said. Another benefit for girls who attend the club, or anyone who identifies as a girl, can put it on their resume and use their coding skills to break into the industry. “Girls Who Code also focuses on facing challenges and being brave,” Buckley said. “It encourages women to think about how to solve something if the answer isn’t immediately available, which is just another cool aspect to this whole thing.” Please take a second to review our community guidelinesCommunity guidelines Blogs Staff Blogs Home All Politics is Local Blazer Banter Brews in Clark Cannabis Chronicles Clark County Faces Digital Desk Family Room Ghost Stories High School Sports HealthBeat History Political Beat Tailgate Talk Community It's the Fair!

Skip to content Repeating Islands News and commentary on Caribbean culture, literature, and the arts Toggle Sidebar January 22, 2017 ‘Dina’: Film Review | Sundance 2017 A report by David Rooney for the Hollywood Reporter. Documentary team Antonio Santini and Dan Sickles train their empathetic gaze on a couple, both on the autism spectrum, as they approach marriage and navigate one another’s foibles. A verité documentary that mirrors the minor-key humor, the rough-hewn texture, the gentle conflicts and awkward grace of many quirky indie narrative features, Dina cozies up unobtrusively to its complex, strong-willed protagonist as she takes charge of her impending wedding and lays out her expectations for a relationship with no shortage of challenges. After capturing Puerto Rico’s trans community in Mala Mala, nonfiction filmmakers Antonio Santini and Dan Sickles here take a sensitive snapshot of two ordinary people on the autism spectrum who are determined to carve out a meaningful future together. The film takes its title from Dina Buno, a 48-year-old family friend of Sickles, who lost her first husband to cancer and survived a violent knife attack by an unhinged subsequent boyfriend, referred to with an affectless absence of drama as “the psycho.” That grim experience has done nothing to inhibit Dina’s desire for close connection. So when an unexpected romance develops with Scott Levin, a Walmart staffer she met at an outer Philadelphia social group for neurologically diverse adults, wedding bells are all but inevitable. However, while the love is mutual, there are plenty of obstacles to their union. Fiercely independent Dina has lived alone for more than 20 years, sustained by a level of self-esteem many of us might envy. Her primary go-to sources for life lessons include Sex and the City, Keeping Up With the Kardashians and I Am Cait. Scott has always lived with his supportive parents, and his closest relationship appears to be with his phone. When he moves into Dina’s apartment to test their compatibility before marriage, their differences become apparent. Scott is good at declaring his affections but less skilled at showing them, and while Dina makes it abundantly clear that she considers sex a vital part of the package, that prospect appears to terrify Scott. Even including a partner when he’s dancing seems beyond his reach. Still, Dina is nothing if not determined, and her stream of patient explanations interspersed with vocal campaigning for her spousal rights makes her a delightful protagonist that we can’t help rooting for. One of the film’s most touching scenes is a bus trip Dina and Scott take together to the New Jersey shore. Scott is already somewhat freaked by the journey, then soothed by his first sight of the ocean. But he’s reluctant to go near it until Dina coaxes him to wade in the lapping waves. He’s a romantic, given to crooning songs like “Before the Next Teardrop Falls,” but when Dina presents him on the boardwalk with a copy of The Joy of Sex as a gift, the message clearly nudges him outside his comfort zone. What makes this candid, unpatronizing movie so engaging is that the sexual conflict is never set up as a deal-breaker, rather as an issue the couple has to work through in their own, mostly roundabout way. Santini and Sickles — aided by cinematographer Adam Uhl, obviously doing everything possible to give the subjects their space — observe the preparations for the butterfly-themed engagement party; Dina’s raunchy bachelorette night, with a hunky “cop” stripper; Scott’s more subdued stag party at a bowling alley; their formalwear fittings; the ceremony and reception; and their honeymoon at a Poconos resort, complete with a hilariously kitschy giant cocktail-glass spa in the newlyweds’ suite. Throughout, they interact with friends and family, not so much seeking advice as talking through their needs and anxieties. The warmth and guidance of Scott’s parents plays in sharp contrast to Dina’s tetchy exchanges with her mother, in which the two of them appear to talk at cross-purposes without really hearing one another. There are also sweet scenes with their mutual friends from the group, Monica Ferrero and Frank Costanzo, whose successful marriage gives Dina and Scott a model to emulate. The filmmakers avoid extraneous commentary, letting their unselfconscious subjects’ humanity speak for itself. The only real evidence of directorial hands at work is the choice to play the 911 call from Dina’s boyfriend/attacker many years earlier, with her own oddly calm, almost apologetic voice heard in the background. That jolt of violent history is a smart way to remind us of what Dina has overcome and make us even more invested in seeing her build a solid marriage with Scott. And while we don’t witness his miraculous transformation into a sex machine, a spontaneous display of tactile bedroom affection at the end of the movie suggests that a gateway toward harmony has begun to open.

Kyle Connolly WBTV i WBTV LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Law enforcement in Concord said a crash on Miami Church Road just before 2 p.m. Sunday was the result of a police chase that started in Locust. A Locust Police official said the chase started when two suspects stole from a Wal-Mart. Two people – a man and a woman – were arrested after the crash. Neighbors say the car went airborne after going off the side of the road. “It probably came 10 feet in the air,” said Roger Smith, who lives in the home near where the car crashed. One police officer was taken to the hospital with injuries that were not life-threatening. The car with the suspects inside was the only vehicle involved in the crash. Smith said one of the suspects was found near his home. “Guy got out and run behind my trailer,” Smith said. “They surrounded him, got the dogs out here, and about an hour later, they found him in front of my trailer here, and they apprehended him.” Tony Cox, another neighbor who lives near the scene of the crash, said he has never seen so many police cars in this community. “Usually cars just keep going by every day. You don’t get a whole stop out here with cops and a Dukes of Hazzard across the ditch over there through a telephone pole,” Cox said.

In addition to helping you cook up the perfect filet mignon, charcoal has alleged detoxifying properties and acts as a remedy for food poisoning, resulting in charcoal-infused products from lemonade to charcoal-infused hand soap.

In April, Whole Foods partnered with Imperfect Produce to test the sales of “funky” fruits and veggies in a handful of stores in Northern California in an effort to reduce food waste. Other retailers such as Walmart have also jumped on the “ugly” wagon. On Jan. 17, Hy-Vee partnered with Robinson Fresh – one of the largest produce companies in the world – to sell “ugly” produce. In a Hy-Vee press release, the company’s Vice President of Produce and Health Markets, John Griesenbrock states, “the beauty of this program is that the produce tastes the same and is of the same high quality, it just looks different.” Decorating ugly gords with imperfect produce at Dia de Los Muertos Fruitvale #uglyproduce #imperfectproduce #imperfectperfection #whoyoucallingugly #happyhalloween A photo posted by Emma Dilemma (@chefdilemma) on Oct 30, 2016 at 4:07pm PDT Poke Poke, pronounced “po-kay,” is a Hawaiian specialty that has made its way to the mainland. Poke is essentially cubed, fresh raw seafood (usually octopus or tuna) mixed with soy sauce, green onions, and sesame oil, served over rice. “You will start to see more around the poke trend,” Darren Tristano, president of Technomic, told CNBC, explaining that the trend will shortly move from fine dining establishments to niche restaurants, to menus across the country. According to the National Restaurant Association, poke was named a “hot trend for 2017” after surveying more than 1,300 professional chefs. “Menu trends today are beginning to shift from ingredient-based items to concept-based ideas, mirroring how consumers tend to adapt their activities to their overall lifestyle philosophies, such as environmental sustainability and nutrition,” Hudson Riehle, senior vice president of research for the National Restaurant Association, said in a statement.

BCBG Max Azria, with its 570 brick-and-mortar boutiques, is the latest American retail firm to fall prey to digital competition. On Thursday, Bloomberg reported that the fashion label, one of three under the BCBG Max Azria Group umbrella, which also includes Herve Leger and BCBGeneration, is closing several stores and shifting its focus to e-commerce, wholesaling through other retailers and licensing. Said Seth Lubove, a spokesman for BCBG at Sitrick & Co., "Like so many other great brands, BCBG has been negatively impacted by the growth in online sales and shifts in customer shopping patterns and, as a result, has too large a physical retail footprint." The company founded by Max Azria in 1989 (which stands for the French phrase "bon chic, bon genre") peaked in the mid-2000s, finding favor on the red carpets with tween darlings Lauren Conrad, Camilla Belle and Miley Cyrus, the latter of whom collaborated with Azria on a short-lived Walmart collection in 2009. One of the most powerful figures to emerge from the L.A. fashion scene in the last 25 years, Azria, an immigrant from Tunisia, was early to the idea of democratizing fashion, selling gowns in the $500 range and showing them on the runway in New York to lend a high-fashion patina. He built an international empire that once boasted $1 billion in retail sales. He is married to Lubov Azria, chief creative officer of the BCBG Max Azria Group. The West Coast couple made headlines in 2015 for selling their Beverly Hills estate for $85 million. BCBG Max Azria has struggled over the past few years, hampered by overly aggressive brand extensions and retail expansion plans, and increased competition from fast fashion giants Zara and H&M. Last year, 123 employees were laid off from its Vernon, Calif.-based offices. The company has hired Alix Partners LP to restructure its debt load, although, according to Bloomberg's sources, the company isn't in risk of bankruptcy. Just last week, fellow L.A.-based retailer American Apparel announced the closure of all 110 of its retail stores. Other mall fixtures, including Macy's and Sears, also announced store closures scheduled for early 2017, and all of The Limited stores closed this month.

The full reasons— after a recent Ontario Review Board hearing — for denying Johnson’s request to go shopping reveal the shopping trips he sought weren’t “a major concern,” for him and he was more interested in having access to the Waypoint Centre for Mental Health Care grounds with his family. What also is clear in the reasons — the follow-up report to the decision made in December to deny Johnson, known as the “Balcony Strangler,” any changes to the conditions of his detention — is that Johnson “likes to be in control” and there is no known treatment for his complex set of mental illnesses. Johnson, 69, was found insane after killing seven women and assaulting 10 women in the 1970s. His victims lived in London and Guelph. The former Ford worker would scale apartment balconies, enter apartments, strangle his victims, then clean up their apartments before leaving. He has been at the Waypoint facility in Penetanguishine ever since. The December hearing was held to consider whether Johnson should be able to go into Penetanguishine and Midland on escorted trips to shop for computer equipment at Walmart. The hospital and the Crown opposed the request. Bill Veldboom, brother of Johnson’s last victim, Donna Veldboom, was at the hearing with 16 others. He said Johnson’s argument for extended privilege was weak “and he did not do a good job making a case.” Veldboom said he believes it was another example of Johnson trying to secure special privileges that others will want, similar to the walks outside the secure area that he’s already earned. “I believe this feeds his ego and builds his image and status among his peers,” Veldboom said in an email. “I believe it is about his need to be the ‘alpha male’ in the facility. Even in the hearing, one could observe his interest in controlling the dialogue.” The board was told there wasn’t enough hospital staff to go into the community with a patient for anything other that medical, legal or compassionate purposes. There were fears the hospital “would be flooded with requests from other patients.” Johnson, it was agreed, has been stable and well-behaved during his escorted walks outside the hospital’s perimeter. While other patients have three staff escorts, Johnson always has four. He was a member of the “outside gang” before 2005 that did work outside the secure perimeter of the hospital. The report reviewed Johnson’s diagnoses that include a wide array of sexual deviance such as sadism, voyeurism and fetishism and narcissistic personality disorder. Johnson’s doctor testified that “none of the psychiatrists or professional people who have dealt with Mr. Johnson have been able to find an explanation as to why Mr. Johnson acted as he did.” Johnson agreed during his testimony he did have visits with his family in the visitor’s complex on the grounds and that he had a computer in his room. All he said he wanted, even though it “wasn’t a major concern,” was to have shopping trips once or twice a year. The board decided the trips weren’t necessary, ordered no change to his status, and accepted Johnson is “a very high-risk individual.” jsims@postmedia.com Featured Businesses Contact us to Advertise » New Homes Rembrandt Homes Travel & Lodging Elgin Travel and Cruises Travelplus Automotive Auto Spa Self Serve Car Wash & Dog Wash Go to the Marketplace » Contribute Send Your Scoop!

Companies eager to avoid becoming the target of the next attack by President-elect Donald Trump are preemptively — or retroactively — announcing U.S. job creation plans. "When automakers such as Toyota announced their new strategies in response to the so-called Trump risk, the industry was nervous and asked 'Who's next?'" Kim Jin-woo, an analyst at Korea Investment & Securities Co. told Bloomberg after Hyundai-Kia announced it would invest $3.1 billion in the U.S. over the next five years. Play Facebook Twitter Google Plus Embed How much credit does Donald Trump deserve for job creation since election? 2:50 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src="http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/857217091942" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe> The risk is that Trump will include your name in a negative tweet, spawning a PR crisis and a temporary stock price ding. He's gone after automakers like Toyota for making cars in Mexico, Lockheed for cost overruns on the F-35 fighter jet program, and drug companies for high prices and anti-competitive behavior. Trump has used Twitter to threaten U.S. companies who manufacture in foreign countries with import tariffs. In December, Trump blindsided aircraft manufacturer Lockheed-Martin over the cost of its fighter jet program contracted by the U.S. Air Force. After campaigning on pledges to make U.S. companies bring jobs back, Trump has announced he's been successful at doing so before he's even president. So on Tuesday as business returned following the Martin Luther King federal holiday, a bevy of companies announced they would be adding jobs after the inauguration on Friday. Put down automaker GM for 1,500. Add 10,000 from Wal-Mart. "Thousands" for Hyundai. And Bayer said it would keep 9,000 jobs and add 3,000. That is, if the government gives it the regulatory approval to merge with Monsanto. Amazon didn't mention Trump in its press release announcing 100,000 U.S. jobs, mostly in fulfillment warehouses, but CEO Jeff Bezos attended a meeting of the tech titans at Trump Tower with the president-elect just before Christmas. Related: Trump Summons Tech Titans to Trump Tower "Pretty much everybody is dreading being the subject of a tweet," Kristin Dziczek, a spokeswoman for the Center for Automotive Research told the Guardian. "Getting hauled out into the court of public opinion with virtually no warning is not something anybody wants to get engaged with." They join a small but growing list of companies with recent job creation or preservation announcements tied either explicitly or implicitly to the PEOTUS, including Amazon, Carrier, Fiat Chrysler, Ford, and Sprint. Not So Fast But peel back a layer and the promises come with some caveats. A company's plan to increase capital expenditures, which include jobs and facility improvements, are typically years in the making. Some of these "announcements" are old news in a new hat. GM said its plan was approved before the election, but told Bloomberg it was "accelerated" under pressure from Trump, for example. Related: GM's Newly Announced $1B Investment Plans Likely Date Back to 2014 Wal-Mart's job creation plans are in line with its normal annual increase, and come after it has closed 269 under-performing stores and cut thousands of jobs. The combined Bayer-Monsanto U.S. R&D spending pledge is roughly what the two companies are already spending, CNBC reported. And Sprint's jobs were part of a previously announced commitment by its parent company to create 50,000 jobs in the U.S. "This is the normal course of business," independent auto industry consultant Maryann Keller told Bloomberg of the moves by GM and other automakers. "All they're doing is announcing investments that they would have made anyway." President-elect Donald J. Trump responded to NBC News' coverage of this story in a series of tweets Wednesday to reassert credit for the job announcements. PEOTUS Trump tweets in response to NBC News' coverage of this story.

(FABRICE COFFRINI/AFP/Getty Images) Canada needs to work on its private-equity game Add to ... TAWFIK HAMMOUD and VINAY SHANDAL Special to The Globe and Mail Published Sunday, Jan. 22, 2017 5:59PM EST Last updated Sunday, Jan. 22, 2017 6:00PM EST Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print Tawfik Hammoud is the global head of BCG’s Principal Investors & Private Equity practice and is based in Toronto. Vinay Shandal is a partner and managing director in BCG’s Toronto office. When you look at who attended last week’s World Economic Forum in Davos, it’s striking how many are global investors or work for large funds – and in particular, private-equity firms. The question Canadians should be asking themselves is, how do we ensure that Canada receives its fair share of the trillions of dollars deployed by global investment funds, including real estate, infrastructure, venture capital and private equity? How can our entrepreneurs and company owners benefit from this growth capital and the opportunities that come with it? How can we create an investment ecosystem that gives rise to more Canadian investment firms led by top professionals? The global investors who gathered in Davos, Switzerland, have much to be thankful for. Business is thriving and the various private asset classes’ performance keeps pumping up demand, especially relative to fixed income and public equities. Take private equity, for example: 94 per cent of investors in a recent survey count themselves satisfied with the returns, and more than 85 per cent say they intend to commit more or the same amount of capital to private equity next year. As a result, the capital flowing into private equity is unprecedented, established firms are raising record amounts of money and fund oversubscription is common. More than 600 new private-equity funds were created last year alone and the industry is holding $1.3-trillion (U.S.) of “dry powder,” or uninvested capital, that is sitting on the sidelines waiting to be invested. While the merits and operating model of private equity can and should be debated (as they were when former private-equity man Mitt Romney ran for president in the 2012 U.S. election), there is no denying its growing importance in many economies. Carlyle Group and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. (and their portfolio companies) employ more people than any other U.S. public company outside of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. The sector’s roaring success might also be the biggest risk to its future. There might be such a thing as too much money, after all. A swath of new entrants is pouring into private assets, searching for yield in a world of low interest rates. Chinese, Middle Eastern and other emerging markets investors are on the rise and have quadrupled their outbound investment over the past few years. Sovereign wealth funds, pension plans, insurance companies and even some mutual funds are allocating money to the private markets and borrowing from their playbooks. So much money chasing a limited number of opportunities has pushed prices up: historically high multiples combined with lower levels of leverage are putting pressure on returns. Private-equity deal multiples, for example, have exceeded the peaks last seen in 2006-07 for larger transactions (deals above $500-million) and deals above $250-million are also flirting with these highs. But most indicators still point to a favourable outlook as long as the credit markets remain fluid and fund managers continue to create value during their ownership period. Canadian pension funds, many of which were present at Davos, are increasingly active in this crowded field. They have invested time and money to develop direct capabilities and increasingly stronger investment teams. In many regards, they are years ahead of their peers around the world. However, outside of our pension funds and a few select local firms, Canada tends to punch under its weight. We lack the kind of developed investment ecosystems that are thriving in other countries. As an example, the United States has 24 times more private-equity funds than Canada and has raised nearly 40 times more capital over the past 10 years. The point is broader: Canada should be attracting more foreign direct investment, including money from global investment firms. FDI in Canada has grown by just 2 per cent a year since 2005, compared with an average of 7 per cent for all OECD countries and 8 per cent for Australia. As a percentage of GDP, Canada still sits in the middle of pack of OECD countries, but 30 per cent of that investment is driven by mining and oil and gas and is heavily skewed to M&A as opposed to greenfield investment (relative to other countries). Something doesn’t add up. Canada is a great place to put money to work. We are a country with low political risk, competitive corporate taxes, an educated and diverse labour force, liquid public markets and a real need for infrastructure investments. Yet, we are net exporters of capital: foreign investors are often not finding Canadian opportunities as attractive as they should. For all the criticism the investment industry sometimes faces, it would be a real miss if we failed to show long-term, growth-minded investors that Canada is an attractive place to put their money to work. We want global investors writing cheques for stakes in Canadian companies, so they can help improve their productivity, invest in technology, create new jobs, and grow global champions in many industries. If investors don’t hear our compelling story, Canada and many of its companies could be left on the sidelines as they watch all this dry powder get deployed in other markets.

Everything has been thought of, everything you might need for a ride over the falls in a Fascist apocalypse. You see, it's just an ordinary barrel, after all. What would you expect at this point?

So, it's side splitting, watching the new Republican Congress, anxiously waiting at the Capital door for the night watchman to come open up. Running to their desks anxious to rob the sick and infirm of their healthcare, without any replacement in sight. Proud of their actions, proud of being pathologically sadistic. Proud of being mean-spirited and ugly to human beings who've done them no injury. It just galls them they're alive and now"well they're gonna do something about it. Just like, you know who. From the grassy knowle to the wreckage of the twin towers, the plan comes together. An attorney General, unfit to be a judge. A Martin Boreman type, if ever there was one. A clever organizer, a strict functionary, greasing the wheels of injustice, painting over the usual atrocities with the dull paint of "we say so," legality. And just like last time, the leader is a funny clown, who says funny things and gets angry a lot of the time. He appeals to "the little guy." The disaffected tens of millions, struggling to get by on Wal-Mart wages. Living in fear of that noise under the hood of the car, living in wage slave, terror. The people should know better; but they don't, never have and I guess never will. Debs said it, "When great changes occur in history, when great principles are involved, as a rule the majority are wrong." Hillary Clinton was the establishment candidate. After eight years of Barack Obama's, bombastic lectures about "Good times coming," which never arrived. Their patience wore thin, an anemic economy, wage growth non-existent. Those seven and half-million "Officially" unemployed, they voted with their asses and stayed home. The ten-million, part-time workers and the three-million discouraged workers, what did Hillary offer them, but more of the same? You can tell people unemployment is 4.7% but they know it's over nine, they can feel it in their bones. - Advertisement - A television addled populace, getting political education from Madonna.

Brian Stoffel (TMFCheesehead) Jan 22, 2017 at 10:36AM For what seemed like an eternity, Whole Foods Market (NASDAQ:WFM) essentially had the entire national organic niche to itself. And emerging from the Great Recession, it proved to be an amazingly profitable niche to occupy. But with that success came competition -- from traditional grocers and specialty shops alike. One of those specialty shops was Sprouts Farmers Market (NASDAQ:SFM) (NASDAQ:SFM) Image source: Getty Images. The last three years haven't been kind to these players. As bigger grocers like Costco, Wal-Mart, and -- perhaps most importantly -- Kroger have entered the scene, shoppers have found cheaper and more convenient alternatives for getting their organic goods. Does that mean that these stocks make compelling buys at these prices? And if so, which is the better choice? Financial Fortitude When companies have a long runway for growth, investors usually like to see management putting sales right back into the company. Whole Foods and Sprouts believe that there's potential for at least a doubling of store counts in the future -- and the organic industry has stood the test of time: It's here to stay. But it's also wise for management to keep a cash cushion on hand -- and avoid too much debt. That's because every company -- at one point or another -- is going to endure tough economic times. Those that have resources on hand will be able to withstand the squeeze, and those that are debt heavy likely won't. Here's how Whole Foods and Sprouts stack up in terms of financial fortitude. Company Cash Debt Net Income Free Cash Flow Whole Foods $852 million $1 billion $507 million $400 million Sprouts $50 million $320 million $135 million $87 million Data source: Yahoo! Finance. Until recently, Whole Foods took a very prudent stance toward debt: It didn't carry any. Even today, new store openings are financed through free cash flow (FCF). Instead, the debt was taken on to finance share repurchases because interest rates were so low. Without a doubt, Whole Foods is in better financial shape than Sprouts. While Whole Foods is valued at three-and-a-half times the size of Sprouts, it has 17 times more cash on hand, and a much healthier cash-to-debt ratio. Sustainable competitive advantages If you're going to spend an hour evaluating a stock, I suggest you devote at least 45 of those minutes to investigating the underlying company's sustainable competitive advantage. That's because in my history as an investor, this -- often referred to as a "moat" -- has easily been the variable that correlates the most with my overall returns. In the simplest sense, a company's moat is what separates it from the pack, what makes it special and unique, and keeps customers coming back year after year. For a long time, Whole Foods made up a large portion of my family's holdings. They were simply offering the best organic goods for the best prices in the industry. But that moat has shriveled up over time -- due to the aforementioned competition. The company is now experimenting with a new, cheaper store format -- dubbed 365 -- in the face of that competition. Whole Foods 365 is very similar to a Sprouts store, which typically smaller format. I don't think either of these companies have very impressive moats -- as just about any store these days can offer organic goods, and it's a race to offer the lowest prices. Valuation While valuation isn't an exact science, there are some straightforward metrics that give an idea of how expensive a stock is. Company P/E P/FCF PEG Ratio Dividend FCF Payout Ratio Whole Foods 20 25 2.8 1.8% 44% Sprouts 22 32 1.5 N/A N/A Data source: Yahoo! Finance, E*Trade. P/E represents figures from non-GAAP earnings. Based on the PEG Ratio alone -- which factors in the potential for future growth -- Sprouts appears to be priced at a 45% discount to Whole Foods. But based on FCF, Whole Foods is the cheaper stock -- and its worth noting that the company's FCF is depressed due to the fact that new stores are financed from FCF, not from issuing debt. Add in the fact that Whole Foods offers a very sustainable dividend, and it's tough to argue that either has a clear valuation advantage. And the winner is... Whole Foods I'm a huge fan of the healthy eating/eco-conscious movement. In fact, I'm typing these words from an organic coffee farm in Costa Rica where my family lives half of the year. But as far as these companies go, they don't have a monopoly on organic goods. That's great for consumers, but bad for Whole Foods and Sprouts. While I believe Whole Foods has a brighter future relative to Sprouts -- thanks in large part to its balance sheet -- I'm not particularly optimistic when it comes to either stock.

Files wants 5-year sunset on all tax exemptions, Rep. Sabin argues for EITC measure FinanceTalk Politics by Roby Brock (roby@talkbusiness.net) 5 days ago 669 views  Tags: EITC Rep. Warwick Sabin Senator Jake Files tax cuts 0 SHARES Share Tweet The chairman of the Senate Revenue and Tax Committee says he will file a bill to push for a sunset on all tax exemptions for the state of Arkansas. Appearing on this week’s edition of Talk Business & Politics, Sen. Jake Files, R-Fort Smith, said he will file legislation as early as next week to put a 5-year sunset on all tax exemptions allowed in Arkansas. Over the course of the Blue Ribbon Commission on tax reform work, that will likely come from this session, Files said the groups receiving exemptions will have to re-justify the need. “I’m working on it [the bill] now, that will sunset all exemptions in the next five years. I ask people to come back. If you’re getting an exemption, then it ought to be worth something because it’s costing the state money and we’re actually taxing other people. Hopefully we can close some of those loopholes, broaden the base and lower everyone’s tax burden in Arkansas,” Files said. According to a 2012 Department of Finance and Administration analysis, tax exemptions amount to hundreds of millions of dollars or more than $1 billion, depending on interpretations. State legislators are currently debating three major tax cut proposals in the 91st General Assembly. They include the governor’s $50.5 million low-income tax cut proposal, a military retirement benefits tax cut, and an Earned Income Tax Credit, which targets low-income individuals. Files said that the military tax cut, which was to be paid in part by a tax increase on manufactured housing sales, is being altered to include a tax on digital downloads instead. “There’s a carve-out for digital downloads that just deals with CDs, books and movies so when you walk into Wal-Mart or Best Buy you’re going to pay tax on those things. If you download them, you don’t,” Files said. “This just brings equity to those two things, but it should bring the bill in line and I think once we get this thing fixed next week, I think you’ll see smooth passage for it as well.” Files is also sponsoring a measure that beefs up tax collections on Internet purchases, a program known as eFairness, that he contends could add $100 million to the state coffers if enforced. “The interesting thing here is that it’s not a new tax,” he said. “The fact that it’s not being collected doesn’t mean that it’s not on the books. This replaces a use tax so when you buy something online, you’re required to pay that tax and I think there’s been more collection of that but there’s not nearly enough. This just brings parity along, brick and mortar stores, with the Internet collections. I think you’re seeing this all across the country.” Rep. Warwick Sabin, D-Little Rock, has been pushing for an alternative to Gov. Asa Hutchinson’s low-income tax cut package. While he’s supportive of the $50.5 million tax cut, he contends his EITC bill will help more people. Sabin says the EITC is more targeted, costs less and is a proven policy. “It’s cheaper and a lot of the reason why it’s cheaper is because it’s more efficient,” Sabin said of the $40 million price tag. Could all three measures – totaling more than $90 million – reach the governor’s desk? Sabin said, “Well, I don’t think so. I think we need to be responsible. There’s a burden here on the budget and part of this all started with the fact that in ’13, we cut capital gains rates for the most wealthy Arkansans. In ’15, we cut the rates for middle-class Arkansans and the only people who have been left out are the low income working Arkansans and that’s what we’re all trying to get to… I don’t think you can do all of it because I don’t think the budget could withstand that.” Files, a supporter of EITC, said it will get a hearing in his Senate committee, but he’s not sure if all three work their way through the legislature. “I do think it’s worthy of a good debate and I think it’s a great policy for the state. It’s actually a Ronald Reagan anti-poverty bill back in the day.” Watch their full discussion in the video below.

Motley Fool Staff (the_motley_fool) Jan 22, 2017 at 8:48AM Buying a home is one of the biggest, if not the biggest, financial decision most Americans will make. In this clip from the Industry Focus podcast, analyst Michael Douglass shares what he's learned so far in his research about the home-buying process and explains why one of his 2017 resolutions is to learn even more. Find out what you'll want to save up for before making a down payment, the benefits of a good inspector, how homeownership classes might be worth your time and money, and more. A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on Jan. 13, 2017. Dylan Lewis: So, one of your resolutions that is not mine because it's not the phase in life that I'm at right now -- Michael Douglass: [laughs] Because it's mine. Lewis: Because it's yours. It's to understand the home-buying process a little bit more. Douglass: Yes. So, this actually ties in with things like credit score, too, because your credit score is an incredibly important three-digit number for getting a mortgage. My wife and I have been saving for probably about two years now toward buying a house. In the D.C. area, not cheap, not easy. Some time this year, we will hit goal one, which is to get a roughly 20% down payment together, plus closing costs, plus emergency fund, to make sure that we are not heavily leveraged, that we are able to have some play, here, and figure out what makes sense. You definitely don't want to be in a spot where you buy a house, and the next day, somebody rear ends you, and suddenly you're in a cash crunch. Lewis: So, this is something you've been building to for several years. Douglass: Yes. So now, what we really need to do is understand beyond that. We're looking at a 20% down payment at some point this year. Now we need to figure out, how does this whole thing actually work? And there are home buying classes that the commonwealth of Virginia offers for free. We're planning to attend one of those maybe later this month, maybe in February. Then we need to talk to mortgage brokers and realtors, maybe Rocket Mortgage. Lewis: Maybe Rocket Mortgage. Douglass: And inspectors, and things like that, and figure out what all that looks like. There are some really clear financial benefits to this. I believe that a good realtor is worth a fair amount of money. I threw out a number, which is $10,000, the assumption being that, either in terms of helping negotiate down the cost of the house, or getting folks to throw in, "Oh, well, sure, we'll replace the toilet," that sort of thing. And/or, the benefit of a good inspector, which is maybe some deferred maintenance that you can make sure gets pulled into that price. I think that's worth $10,000. It turns out that many lenders will offer you a slight reduction in your mortgage rate if you take a home-buying class. Lewis: Makes sense. Douglass: Yeah. It's a 0.125% reduction on a $350,000 mortgage, which is $5,796 in interest saved over a 30-year period. So, all told, that works out to almost $16,000. I'm estimating it's going to take me about 108 hours or so of research, not including the actual home-buying process. That's just like, "What do you want? Do you want fireplaces? Chimneys?" All that stuff. Lewis: Do you want fireplaces? Chimneys? Douglass: You know, I don't really care, to be honest. I think my wife has a lot more opinions on that than I do. I probably will start having opinions, but I'm not there yet. ROI, assuming all those numbers are correct, is $146 per hour spent, which is a lot of money. Lewis: And that's a resolution that lends itself very well to your ROI and time spent type methodology. You can see the savings much more clearly, particularly when you have a class that is going to reduce the interest rates that you're paying. So, as things lend themselves to that, that becomes a particularly powerful tool to incentivize you. Douglass: We should keep making plays on words with lend, since mortgage lenders, all that sort of thing. Lewis: [laughs] Oh, gosh. Douglass: But yeah, it's something that that I'm actually really excited about. It's a huge financial decision, often one of the largest that most Americans make. So, I want to make sure that I do it careful and methodically and correctly. The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy.

Koopal, 77 Hormel plant employees raise $135,671 for United Way Dammen Nordic Cross Country Ski Race Saturday O’Connor pleads guilty to multiple felonies By Jason Schoonover Email the author Published 7:01 am Sunday, January 22, 2017 A 34-year-old Austin woman charged in six Mower County cases with various counts of financial fraud, check forgery, theft and drug possession has pleaded guilty to several of the felonies she faces. Meranda Lynn O’Connor took a plea agreement Friday in Mower County District Court and pleaded guilty to two counts of felony check forgery, theft, felony check forgery for more than $250, and fifth-degree drug possession. O’Connor In the various cases, O’Connor forged a nearly $400 check intended to buy a vacuum for the Mower County jail, forged checks at Hy-Vee and Wal-Mart, forged a credit card rewards check, and maxed out a credit card through more than $1,000 in several online purchases before she was eventually arrested.  Police tracked her whereabouts when she tried to use the maxed out credit card to order from Steve’s Pizza. In one case, a woman spoke to law enforcement on Aug. 24, 2016, about her US Bank credit card being “maxed out” in a suspected scam. According to the court complaint, she’d found out her card had been used for several purchases: $500 at Victoria’s Secret, $30.87 at Steve’s Pizza, $200.95 at www.jpay.com, $500 on www.squaredup.com and $1 on www.amazon.com. When she was finally arrested, police found plastic bags used to possess drugs, a piece of paper with a debit card number and a person’s name, and a bag of 1.15 grams of methamphetamine. In 2012, she was sentenced to three years probation on one count of uttering altered currency, and she was sentenced to five years probation in 2015 in Freeborn County for offering a forged check. She is scheduled to be sentenced on April 27. Print Article Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

The answer was thoughtful, smart, and terrifying. Rick PerlsteinJan/Feb 2017 Issue Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Email Mike McQuade This past October, I taught a weeklong seminar on the history of conservatism to honors students from around the state of Oklahoma. In five long days, my nine very engaged students and I got to know each other fairly well. Six were African American women. Then there was a middle-aged white single mother, a white kid who looked like any other corn-fed Oklahoma boy and identified himself as "queer," and the one straight white male. I'll call him Peter. Peter is 21 and comes from a town of about 3,000 souls. It's 85 percent white, according to the 2010 census, and 1.2 percent African American—which would make for about 34 black folks. "Most people live around the poverty line," Peter told the class, and hunting is as much a sport as a way to put food on the table. Peter was one of the brightest students in the class, and certainly the sweetest. He liked to wear overalls to school—and on the last day, in a gentle tweak of the instructor, a red "Make America Great Again" baseball cap. A devout evangelical, he'd preferred former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee at the start of the primary season, but was now behind Donald Trump. One day the students spent three hours drafting essays about the themes we'd talked about in class. I invited them to continue writing that night so the next morning we could discuss one of their pieces in detail. I picked Peter's because it was extraordinary. In only eight hours he'd churned out eight pages, eloquent and sharp. When I asked him if I could discuss his essay in this article, he replied, "That sounds fine with me. If any of my work can be used to help the country with its political turmoil, I say go for it!" Then he sent me a new version with typos corrected and a postelection postscript: "My wishful hope is that my compatriots will have their tempers settled by Trump's election, and that maybe both sides can learn from the Obama and Trump administrations in order to understand how both sides feel. Then maybe we can start electing more moderate people, like John Kasich and Jim Webb, who can find reasonable commonality on both sides and make government work." Did I mention he was sweet? When he read the piece aloud in class that afternoon in October, the class was riveted. Several of the black women said it was the first time they'd heard a Trump supporter clearly set forth what he believed and why. (Though, defying stereotypes, one of these women—an aspiring cop—was also planning to vote for Trump.) Peter's essay took off from the main class reading, Corey Robin's The Reactionary Mind: Conservatism From Edmund Burke to Sarah Palin. Its central argument is that conservative movements across history are united in their devotion to the maintenance of received social hierarchy. Peter, whose essay was titled "Plight of the Redneck," had a hard time seeing how that applied to the people he knew. "These people are scraping the bottom of the barrel, and they, seemingly, have nothing to benefit from maintaining the system of order that keeps them at the bottom." "We all live out in the wilderness, either in the middle of a forest or on a farm," he wrote. "Some people cannot leave their homes during times of unfortunate weather. Many still dry clothes by hanging them on wires with clothespins outside. These people are nowhere near the top, or even the middle, of any hierarchy. These people are scraping the bottom of the barrel, and they, seemingly, have nothing to benefit from maintaining the system of order that keeps them at the bottom." His county ended up going about 70 percent for Trump. Concerning race, Peter wrote, "In Oklahoma, besides Native Americans, there have traditionally been very few minorities. Few blacks have ever lived near the town that I am from...Even in my generation, despite there being a little more diversity, there was no racism, nor was there a reason for racism to exist." His town's 34 or so black people might beg to differ, of course; white people's blindness to racism in their midst is an American tradition. As one of the African American students in the class—I'll call her Karen—put it, whites in her town see "racism as nonexistent unless they witness it firsthand. And then it almost has to be over the top—undeniable acts of violence like hate crimes or cross burnings on front lawns—before they would acknowledge it as such." But it's relevant to the story I'm telling that I'm certain Peter isn't individually, deliberately racist, and that Karen agrees. Still, Peter's thinking might help us frame a central debate on the left about what to make of Trump's victory. Is it, in the main, a recrudescence of bigotry on American soil—a reactionary scream against a nation less white by the year? Or is it more properly understood as an economically grounded response to the privations that neoliberalism has wracked upon the heartland? Peter knows where he stands. He remembers multiple factories and small businesses "shutting down or laying off. Next thing you know, half of downtown" in the bigger city eight miles away "became vacant storefronts." Given that experience, he has concluded, "for those people who have no political voice and come from states that do not matter, the best thing they can do is try to send in a wrecking ball to disrupt the system." When Peter finished with that last line, there was a slight gasp from someone in the class—then silence, then applause. They felt like they got it. I was also riveted by Peter's account, convinced it might be useful as a counterbalance to glib liberal dismissals of the role of economic decline in building Trumpland. Then I did some research. According to the 2010 census, the median household income in Peter's county is a little more than $45,000. By comparison, Detroit's is about $27,000 and Chicago's (with a higher cost of living) is just under $49,000. The poverty rate is 17.5 percent in the county and 7.6 percent in Peter's little town, compared with Chicago's 22.7 percent. The unemployment rate has hovered around 4 percent. The town isn't rich, to be sure. But it's also not on the "bottom." Oklahoma on the whole has been rather dynamic economically: Real GDP growth was 2.8 percent in 2014—down from 4.3 percent in 2013, but well above the 2.2 percent nationally. The same was true of other Trump bastions like Texas (5.2 percent growth) and West Virginia (5.1 percent). Peter, though, perceives the region's economic history as a simple tale of desolation and disappointment. "Everyone around was poor, including the churches," he wrote, "and charities were nowhere near (this wasn't a city, after all), so more people had to use some sort of government assistance. Taxes went up [as] the help became more widespread." He was just calling it like he saw it. But it's striking how much a bright, inquisitive, public-spirited guy can take for granted that just is not so. Oklahoma's top marginal income tax rate was cut by a quarter point to 5 percent in 2016, the same year lawmakers hurt the working poor by slashing the earned-income tax credit. On the "tax burden" index used by the website WalletHub, Oklahoma's is the 45th lowest, with rock-bottom property taxes and a mere 4.5 percent sales tax. (On Election Day, Oklahomans voted down a 1-point sales tax increase meant to raise teacher pay, which is 49th in the nation.). As for government assistance, Oklahoma spends less than 10 percent of its welfare budget on cash assistance. The most a single-parent family of three can get is $292 a month—that's 18 percent of the federal poverty line. Only 2,469 of the more than 370,000 Oklahomans aged 18 to 64 who live in poverty get this aid. And the state's Medicaid eligibility is one of the stingiest in the nation, covering only adults with dependent children and incomes below 42 percent of the poverty level—around $8,500 for a family of three. But while Peter's analysis is at odds with much of the data, his overall story does fit a national pattern. Trump voters report experiencing greater-than-average levels of economic anxiety, even though they tend have better-than-average incomes. And they are inclined to blame economic instability on the federal government—even, sometimes, when it flows from private corporations. Peter wrote about the sense of salvation his neighbors felt when a Walmart came to town: "Now there were enough jobs, even part-time jobs...But Walmart constantly got attacked by unions nationally and with federal regulations; someone lost their job, or their job became part-time." It's worth noting that if the largest retail corporation in the world has been conspicuously harmed by unions and regulations of late, it doesn't show in its net profits, which were $14.69 billion in 2015.* And of course, Walmart historically has had a far greater role in shuttering small-town Main Streets than in revitalizing them. But Peter's neighbors see no reason to resent it for that. He writes, "The majority of the people do not blame the company for their loss because they realize that businesses [are about] making money, and that if they had a business of their own, they would do the same thing." It's not fair to beat up on a sweet 21-year-old for getting facts wrong—especially if, as is likely, these were the only facts he was told. Indeed, teaching the class, I was amazed how even the most liberal students took for granted certain dubious narratives in which they (and much of the rest of the country) were marinated all year long, like the notion that Hillary Clinton was extravagantly corrupt. "After continually losing on the economic side," he wrote, "one of the few things that you can retain is your identity." Feelings can't be fact-checked, and in the end, feelings were what Peter's eloquent essay came down to­—what it feels like to belong, and what it feels like to be culturally dispossessed. "After continually losing on the economic side," he wrote, "one of the few things that you can retain is your identity. What it means, to you, to be an American, your somewhat self-sufficient and isolated way of life, and your Christian faith and values. Your identity and heritage is the very last thing you can cling to...Abortion laws and gay marriage are the two most recent upsets. The vast majority of the state of Oklahoma has opposed both of the issues, and social values cannot be forced by the government." On these facts he is correct: In a 2015 poll, 68 percent of Oklahomans called themselves "pro-life," and only 30 percent supported marriage equality. Until 2016 there were only a handful of abortion providers in the entire state, and the first new clinic to open in 40 years guards its entrance with a metal detector. Peter thinks he's not a reactionary. Since that sounds like an insult, I'd like to think so, too. But in writing this piece, I did notice a line in his essay that I had glided over during my first two readings, maybe because I liked him too much to want to be scared by him. "One need only look to the Civil War and the lasting legacies of Reconstruction through to today's current racism and race issues to see what happens when the federal government forces its morals on dissenting parts of the country." The last time I read that, I shuddered. So I emailed Peter. "I say the intrusions were worth it to end slavery and turn blacks into full citizens," I wrote. "A lot of liberals, even those most disposed to having an open mind to understanding the grievances of people like you and yours, will have a hard time with [your words]." Peter's answer was striking. He first objected (politely!) to what he saw as the damning implication behind my observation. Slavery and Reconstruction? "I was using it as an example of government intrusion and how violent and negative the results can be when the government tries to tell people how to think. I take it you saw it in terms of race in politics. The way we look at the same thing shows how big the difference is between our two groups." To him, focusing on race was "an attention-grabbing tool that politicians use to their advantage," one that "really just annoys and angers conservatives more than anything, because it is usually a straw man attack." He compared it to what "has happened with this election: everyone who votes for Trump must be racist and sexist, and there's no possible way that anyone could oppose Hillary unless it's because they're sexist. Accusing racism or sexism eliminates the possibility of an honest discussion about politics." He asked me to imagine "being one of those rednecks under the poverty line, living in a camper trailer on your grandpa's land, eating about one full meal a day, yet being accused by Black Lives Matter that you are benefiting from white privilege and your life is somehow much better than theirs." And that's when I wanted to meet him halfway: Maybe we could talk about the people in Chicago working for poverty wages and being told by Trump supporters that they were lazy. Or the guy with the tamale cart in front of my grocery store—always in front of my grocery store, morning, noon, and night—who with so much as a traffic violation might find himself among the millions whom Trump intends to immediately deport. I wanted to meet him halfway, until he started talking about history. "The reason I used the Civil War and Reconstruction is because it isn't a secret that Reconstruction failed," Peter wrote. "It failed and left the South in an extreme poverty that it still hasn't recovered from." And besides, "slavery was expensive and the Industrial Revolution was about to happen. Maybe if there had been no war, slavery would have faded peacefully." As a historian, I found this remarkable, since it was precisely what all American schoolchildren learned about slavery and Reconstruction for much of the 20th century. Or rather, they did until the civil rights era, when serious scholarship dismantled this narrative, piece by piece. But not, apparently, in Peter's world. "Until urban liberals move to the rural South and live there for probably a decade or more," he concluded, "there's no way to fully appreciate the view." This was where he left me plumb at a loss. Liberals must listen to and understand Trump supporters. But what you end up understanding from even the sweetest among them still might chill you to the bone.

Restaurants Education Environment Bend Deschutes County Politics OSU-Cascades Marijuana Home Local / State Girls Who Code club is closing gender gap in computer science print Share | e-mail Facebook Tweet StumbleUpon Google Girls Who Code club is closing gender gap in computer science By Jillian Ward / The (Coos Bay) World Published Jan 22, 2017 at 12:02AM COOS BAY — It’s time to close the gender gap. One of the largest gaps is in one of the most high-demand and well-paid careers: computer science. Girls Who Code is a club dedicated to evening out the playing field and now it is coming to Coos Bay. “Currently women pose only 18 percent of the computer science field,” said Cayce Hill, youth liaison for Southwestern Oregon Workforce Investment Board, and also a senior at Marshfield High School. “By 2020 there will be 1.4 million job openings and women will only fill 3 percent of that demand. That’s worse than it was in the 1980s, and that gap is growing larger.” SOWIB picked up the program to bring it here after program manager Kyle Stevens saw a presentation. It was something he knew needed to be local. “The closest Girls Who Code club to us was in Newport,” Stevens said. “That’s just too far away, and we have youth here who would definitely benefit from it.” The target number for attendees is 20, and so far almost 15 have signed up. To raise money for the club to get started, Hill initially wrote grants, which has brought in $5,000 from the Jordan Cove Energy Project and $750 from Walmart. “We have several thousands of dollars in grants currently pending,” he added. “Being involved in this feels good because it’s difficult to get educational programs here. Some say there’s not a large enough population to sustain it, but we think we should be giving opportunities to our youth to make sure everyone has an equal shot.” The Girls Who Code club has identified a high interest in computer science coding in girls between sixth and eighth grades, but that interest drops when they reach high school. “We want to educate them at that early age so they can stay interested and close the gender gap,” Hill said. “Being a boy and involved in this project has been interesting, but I think it’s important for there to be diversity in every aspect of life. We get stronger from diversity.” The first meeting was Tuesday in Coos Bay. Leading the weekly classes, which will last until June, is Samantha Buckley, the public health emergency preparedness coordinator for Coos Health and Wellness. Buckley got involved in the project because of the club’s emphasis on sisterhood and education. “It’s important for girls to stick together and support each other,” she said. “Also, every week there is a thing featuring women in the tech world. Women in general in power positions don’t get a lot of attention unless they are beautiful, so examples of what young girls don’t typically see is great.” It doesn’t cost anything to attend the weekly meetings, and for students who can’t afford to buy a laptop, one will be provided. “No one who wants to be involved will be kept from participating in any way,” Hill said. Another benefit for the girls who attend the club, or anyone who identifies as a girl, can put it on their resume and use their coding skills to break into the industry. “Girls Who Code also focuses on facing challenges and being brave,” Buckley said. “It encourages women to think about how to solve something if the answer isn’t immediately available, which is just another cool aspect to this whole thing.” 16244086 View next article in Local/State     Get Central Oregon's top headlines delivered to your inbox every morning GO print version Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus This image is copyrighted.

Ian Brown WASHINGTON, D.C. — The Globe and Mail Published Saturday, Jan. 21, 2017 9:12PM EST Last updated Monday, Jan. 23, 2017 4:04PM EST Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn PrintLicense article The 1.2 million women (and men and children and even a few dogs) around the world who marched in the Women’s March on Washington on Saturday hoped to make history. But they didn’t realize they would turn out in such numbers as to dwarf President Donald Trump’s inauguration the day before. And they surely didn’t expect their knitted, pink, so-called “pussyhats” to have a hand and a head in that history making. The battle of the hats between red “Make America Great Again” ball caps, worn by Donald Trump’s supporters and the knitted “Pussy Power” caps, worn by so many the following day is one of the most telling and unexpected sideshows to have emerged in the bitter political contest between Mr. Trump and women all over the world. Caps created for political purposes, of course, are – well, old hat. Phrygian caps, which date to the 4th century in what is now Eastern Europe, are traditionally soft conical headpieces, with the top pulled forward – a long-time symbol of freedom and the pursuit of liberty, thanks to an early association with caps worn by emancipated slaves in ancient Rome. Working-class Parisians wore the bonnet rouge during the French Revolution: During the Reign of Terror, even aristocrats donned them, to broadcast their allegiance to the masses as Mr. Trump did with his blood-red golf cap. The bonnets were often knitted by tricoteuses, who sat beside guillotines during public executions, never once interrupting their purling.

But right up until the inauguration, it was a controversial headgear, at least in liberal Washington, where Mr. Trump won only 4 per cent of the vote. A group of men wearing Trump hats – no matter how well dressed – always attracted notice when they walked into a downtown Washington bar or restaurant, and it was not unheard of for patrons to make cracks about them – and not just for wearing a hat in a restaurant. “They don’t get a lot of Trump messaging,” said Marilyn Lucht, who lives near the capital. “So when they walked in, the Washingtonians said, ‘Oh, no, they’re here.’” “People made remarks a lot, and some of our staff wanted to not serve them,” an unnameable waitress in an unnameable high-end dining establishment in chic Washington says. “Of course, we’re trained not to. But you do notice them.” That, of course, was the whole point of the Trump cap – to get a movement noticed. The Trump campaign spent $3.2-million (U.S.) on hats alone – a move its managers were ridiculed for, until they won the presidency. The Trump hat sells for $14.98 at Wal-Mart, and for $25 at the Trump Store. The Trump Store hats are made in California. Many of the Trump hats worn by supporters at Friday’s inauguration – as revealed by Reuters – are made in China, Vietnam and Bangladesh, despite Mr. Trump’s ringing promise and threat onstage, in his inauguration speech, to henceforth “Buy American and hire American.” The hat’s slogan, Make America Great Again, stitched in white, was a Ronald Reagan pitch line that Mr. Trump trademarked in 2012. He first wore the hat in Laredo, Tex., at a rally, in the summer of 2015, and it quickly became both a favourite of loyalists, not to mention a bone of contention – even in Canada, when a male student at Mount Royal University wore a Trump hat and was accused of uttering hate speech by the institution’s former vice-president of student life. The Trump hat – much in evidence at the inauguration on Friday – is red, and aggressive: Its slogan tells you what to think. The pussyhat that was everywhere during the vastly better-attended women’s march is an entirely different head game. The pussyhat bears no explicit message, but it does keep you warm. It’s pink, not red. It sells for $25 on Etsy. But from the day the march was announced – which is to say, the day after Donald Trump won the election – women were encouraged to make their own, mainly via the Pussyhat Project. The project was the brainwave of Krista Suh, a screenwriter, and Jayna Zweiman, an architect, both of Los Angeles. The inspiration for the name, of course, was Mr. Trump’s infamous remark, caught on tape, about being able to “grab them by the pussy.” The hat, which can resemble a tea cozy, was designed by Kat Coyle, who owns The Little Knittery, a knitting shop in California, and provided the pattern and knitting instructions to the Pussyhat Project website. From the beginning, women could make hats for themselves or others. And from the beginning, they made improvements and added extras. The hats worn Saturday were a constant topic of admiration and conversation, as were the issues (a smorgasbord of concerns, from abortion and education to health care and global warming) and the jungle of signs (my personal favourites: “I want substantive change but will settle for you not killing me,” and “Imagine a world in which Donald Trump’s mother had access to contraception”). Whether they were singing or yelling or chanting (“You’re orange, you’re gross, and you lost the popular vote!”), the women wore their hats. Those hats came in an astonishing variety, in all shades of pink. Terra Soma, of Portland, knitted hats for her sister, Tara Omara, and their friend, Bree Christenson, of Salt Lake City. She made them with size 39 needles – those are big – and massive Loopy Mango wool, which she bought at her knitting store, Blazing Needles. “One skein is about this big,” she said, reaching her arms out in a full circle in front of her. “It cost $140. But I made five hats out of it.” The result was a big, soft, poofy, funny, fetching hat almost the size of a second head. “We think this may be the original pattern,” Ms. Soma said. People offered to buy their hats as they walked the march. Forty yards away, Page Sargisson and Amy Edgy, a jewellery maker and lawyer from Brooklyn and Washington, respectively, were wearing their only slightly smaller self-knitted Jiffy-Pop-sized tuques. They, too, were made of Loopy Mango yarn, albeit in a more orange colour, and on size 35 needles. “About an hour and a half,” is how long it took Ms. Sargisson to make them. They were marching, Ms. Edgy said, for “equality for all and democracy, which are in short shrift these days.” Laurie Bush-Resko, of Virginia, made hats for herself and her friends – she has a habit of doing this – out of a swirly pink felt that looked like tiny roses. She bought the fabric for $8, stitched the ones they were wearing the day before the march at her home in Rappahannock County, Va., and has tons of material left over. They were standing next to a man wearing a T-shirt that said “supportive dude” who was leading yet another chant: “We want a leader, not a creepy tweeter.” Susan Prows, Victoria Maker and Ellen Miller, of Portland, Los Angeles and New Orleans, respectively, met on Facebook, and convinced one another to attend the march. Ms. Maker bought their hats, and then sewed cat ears on them. They were more interested in talking about the upsetting distance between the people at the march – “We’re a pretty well-heeled crowd,” Ms. Prows, a professor of health policy, said – and the working class who elected Mr. Trump, on the other hand. “They don’t have much more to lose.” All three women were concerned that Americans on either side of the political divide, despite their common stake in human equality, have retreated into their own silos. “Most of us don’t even cross paths with any of the others, in our lives,” Ms. Prows added. Other women turned Trump hats against Trump. Nancy Crowe, of Blue Hill, Me., was wearing a red ball cap that said, “Make America Mexico Again.” She admitted people gave her lots of looks, at least at first, assuming she had the audacity to wear a real Trump hat to a march by women protesting Mr. Trump. (I didn’t see a single one.) Natasha Salazar had done the same thing, and embroidered “America Was Already Pretty (F-word) Good,” except that the expletive was in Russian. Other doctored Trump caps said “Make America Think Again.” “There have been lots of looks, but most people crack up when they actually read it,” Ms. Salazar said. She hopes to market the caps in the future, as a retort to the original. Of course, the more skilled the knitter, the fancier the hat. Kate Lowing, a nurse from the Catskills, is a fast and dedicated knitter, “I have SABLE,” she said – a well-known knit wit’s term for “Stash Acquisition Beyond Life Expectancy,” or extra wool. “It’s a very simple pattern. It’s boring. So you have to add really sparkly bits.” Which she did, in different styles for herself and her husband, then embroidering them with multicoloured metallic fabric. (His was shaped like an Air Force cap.) Then she apologized, and said she had to catch up to her friends. But she turned around as she left. “I’m sorry,” she called back. “I’m really sorry for this person we have elected.” Report Typo/Error Follow Ian Brown on Twitter: @BrownoftheGlobe Also on The Globe and Mail We ask people in the Women’s March on Washington why they wanted to protest (The Globe and Mail)   More Related to this Story WOMEN'S MARCH The resistance begins: more than one million join women’s marches worldwide WOMEN'S MARCH Highlights from the Women’s March on Washington and worldwide In photos In photos: Protesters rally at women's marches around the world Topics Donald Trump Washington, D.C.

Democrats are flustered, anxious, angry, and scared. Protests are in process. Republicans are hopeful, inspired, strengthened and motivated. Celebrations are in process. The divide between the two is getting wider. Democrats and ultra liberals are beside themselves and believe that they must dismiss Trump as a loon. Worse, some are fighting the smooth, peaceful transition of power, a hallmark of American history. Some refused even to go to his inauguration as a demonstration of rejection and disrespect. There was this kind of dysfunction when President W. Bush were elected due to the vote count in Florida. Trump adds to the fray with his outrageous tweeting. The extent of the division became clear to me when Democrats express negativity no matter what positive action is taken by Trump. I mean none. When jobs are saved, remarks are quick to diminish the efforts. I got one diehard Texas liberal to grudgingly admit Trump was experiencing some success with Lockheed Martin’s jobs announcement and costs for the F-35 fighter. A Kentucky libertarian remains unimpressed. Anti-Trumpers refuse to recognize the “Trump Train,” a bandwagon for jobs that started with Carrier and then added Ford, GM, Alibaba, Amazon, Wal-Mart and more. In two months, Trump can boast announcements that could lead to nearly 300,000 new jobs with billions in investments and he was not president yet. While some worry about the Russians, the Iranians, the Syrians, the Chinese and the North Koreans becoming huge obstacles for President Trump, none seem more difficult than domestic political rivals. Look at some of the major actions under fire. - Jobs: All agree we need more and better paying jobs, yet most any effort by Trump is viewed negatively. - Healthcare: Millions of Americans are reeling under the costs and restriction of Obamacare, yet any effort by the Republicans to fix or replace it is used to create fear, uncertainty and doubt. Trump admits there are good parts to ACA, but overall it needs an overhaul. - Budget: All agree our debt is spiraling out of control, yet efforts to rein in program costs are met with cynicism. Worse, naysayers say any efforts by Trump to grow the economy will add to our burgeoning national debt. - Immigration: Trump’s cabinet has said that the priority is on illegal criminals and those who inflict violence, drugs and gangs on us, yet fear spreads about deporting millions of “good people”. - War: President Obama won the Nobel Peace Prize, yet war seems everywhere. Any effort to achieve rapprochement with Russia is derided as naïve and delusional, if not collaborative. In the meantime, all 10 of our Super Carriers are sitting in port in January, none deployed. - Cyberwar: The Democrats focus on the role the Russians played in the election, with some promoting the idea to delegitimize the Trump presidency. When it comes to hacking, we know all parties are guilty, including the U.S. The Chinese are probably the guiltiest of all if we look at the numbers hacked. - Race Relations: America is still stumbling its way forward. President Obama says things are getting better, yet many Americans think it’s worse. Unfortunately, emotions on all sides fall prey to disinformation and fake news. And so it goes. It begs certain questions. Will America spend more time attacking itself rather than the critical issues that face us? Will America seek some kind of cooperative effort to develop solutions, at least in Congress, or will it follow the destructive past of obstructionism and inaction? Will America learn the lesson that when we do not have cooperation between the president and Congress, a practice follows with issuing Executive Orders to circumvent Congress? Isn’t it revealing that a weeks-old president-elect has radically affected business attitudes, Wall Street success, and consumer confidence? It appears evident that the mere idea of having America “open for business” again, of having lower taxes and less regulation, of creating or revising the healthcare plan to be lower in cost and manageable, of addressing security issues at home and abroad with a new approach - all of this is spiking positive activity not seen in a very long time. To be sure, Trump’s style is troubling with his uses of tweets, his bombast and his belligerent behavior. He is a change agent completely outside the norm. It may fail but it could potentially be a game-changer. We all stand to win if the president succeeds in bringing real, positive change to America in the economy, in the military, in the medical community, in the social order, and in our security as a nation. President Trump breaks the mold. He is not a lawyer, a soldier, a lobbyist, a career politician, a preacher, or an academic. That may be just what we need. We cannot judge him or compare him to all those before him. Feeling unchained is disconcerting until we see how great it can be.

Companies eager to avoid becoming the target of the next attack by President-elect Donald Trump are preemptively — or retroactively — announcing U.S. job creation plans. "When automakers such as Toyota announced their new strategies in response to the so-called Trump risk, the industry was nervous and asked 'Who's next?'" Kim Jin-woo, an analyst at Korea Investment & Securities Co. told Bloomberg after Hyundai-Kia announced it would invest $3.1 billion in the U.S. over the next five years.

He's gone after automakers like Toyota for making cars in Mexico, Lockheed for cost overruns on the F-35 fighter jet program, and drug companies for high prices and anti-competitive behavior. Trump has used Twitter to threaten U.S. companies who manufacture in foreign countries with import tariffs. In December, Trump blindsided aircraft manufacturer Lockheed-Martin over the cost of its fighter jet program contracted by the U.S. Air Force. After campaigning on pledges to make U.S. companies bring jobs back, Trump has announced he's been successful at doing so before he's even president. So on Tuesday as business returned following the Martin Luther King federal holiday, a bevy of companies announced they would be adding jobs after the inauguration on Friday. Put down automaker GM for 1,500. Add 10,000 from Wal-Mart. "Thousands" for Hyundai. And Bayer said it would keep 9,000 jobs and add 3,000. That is, if the government gives it the regulatory approval to merge with Monsanto. Amazon didn't mention Trump in its press release announcing 100,000 U.S. jobs, mostly in fulfillment warehouses, but CEO Jeff Bezos attended a meeting of the tech titans at Trump Tower with the president-elect just before Christmas. Related: Trump Summons Tech Titans to Trump Tower "Pretty much everybody is dreading being the subject of a tweet," Kristin Dziczek, a spokeswoman for the Center for Automotive Research told the Guardian. "Getting hauled out into the court of public opinion with virtually no warning is not something anybody wants to get engaged with." They join a small but growing list of companies with recent job creation or preservation announcements tied either explicitly or implicitly to the PEOTUS, including Amazon, Carrier, Fiat Chrysler, Ford, and Sprint. Not So Fast But peel back a layer and the promises come with some caveats. A company's plan to increase capital expenditures, which include jobs and facility improvements, are typically years in the making. Some of these "announcements" are old news in a new hat. GM said its plan was approved before the election, but told Bloomberg it was "accelerated" under pressure from Trump, for example. Related: GM's Newly Announced $1B Investment Plans Likely Date Back to 2014 Wal-Mart's job creation plans are in line with its normal annual increase, and come after it has closed 269 under-performing stores and cut thousands of jobs. The combined Bayer-Monsanto U.S. R&D spending pledge is roughly what the two companies are already spending, CNBC reported. And Sprint's jobs were part of a previously announced commitment by its parent company to create 50,000 jobs in the U.S. "This is the normal course of business," independent auto industry consultant Maryann Keller told Bloomberg of the moves by GM and other automakers. "All they're doing is announcing investments that they would have made anyway." President-elect Donald J. Trump responded to NBC News' coverage of this story in a series of tweets Wednesday to reassert credit for the job announcements. PEOTUS Trump tweets in response to NBC News' coverage of this story.

The ruling elites, terrified by the mobilization of the left in the 1960s, or by what [political scientist] Samuel P. Huntington called America's "excess of democracy," built counter-institutions to delegitimize and marginalize critics of corporate capitalism and imperialism. They bought the allegiances of the two main political parties. They imposed ... obedience to the neoliberal ideology within academia and the press. This campaign, laid out by Lewis Powell in his 1971 memorandum titled "Attack on American Free Enterprise System," was the blueprint for the creeping corporate coup d'e'tat that 45 years later is complete. The destruction of democratic institutions, places where the citizen has agency and a voice, is far graver than the ascendancy to the White House of the demagogue Donald Trump. The coup destroyed our two-party system. It destroyed labor unions. It destroyed public education. It destroyed the judiciary. It destroyed the press. It destroyed academia. It destroyed consumer and environmental protection. It destroyed our industrial base. It destroyed communities and cities. And it destroyed the lives of tens of millions of Americans no longer able to find work that provides a living wage, cursed to live in chronic poverty or locked in cages in our monstrous system of mass incarceration. This coup also destroyed the credibility of liberal democracy. Self-identified liberals such as the Clintons and Barack Obama mouthed the words of liberal democratic values while making war on these values in the service of corporate power. The revolt we see rippling across the country is a revolt not only against a corporate system that has betrayed workers, but also, for many, liberal democracy itself. This is very dangerous. It will allow the radical right under a Trump administration to cement into place an Americanized fascism. "Ignorance allied with power," James Baldwin wrote, "is the most ferocious enemy justice can have." - Advertisement - It turns out, 45 years later, that those who truly hate us for our freedoms are not the array of dehumanized enemies cooked up by the war machine -- the Vietnamese, Cambodians, Afghans, Iraqis, Iranians or even the Taliban, al-Qaida and ISIS. They are the financiers, bankers, politicians, public intellectuals and pundits, lawyers, journalists and business people cultivated in the elite universities and business schools who sold us the utopian dream of neoliberalism. We are entering the twilight phase of capitalism. Wealth is no longer created by producing or manufacturing. It is created by manipulating the prices of stocks and commodities and imposing a crippling debt peonage on the public. Our casino capitalism has merged with the gambling industry. The entire system is parasitic. It is designed to prey on the desperate -- young men and women burdened by student loans, underpaid workers burdened by credit card debt and mortgages, towns and cities forced to borrow to maintain municipal services. Casino magnates such as Sheldon Adelson and hedge fund managers such as Robert Mercer add nothing of value to society. They do not generate money but instead redistribute it upwards to the 1 percent. They use lobbyists and campaign contributions to build monopolies -- this is how the drug company Mylan raised the price of an "EpiPen," used to treat allergy reactions, from $57 in 2007 to about $500 -- and to rewrite laws and regulations. They have given themselves the legal power to carry out a tax boycott, loot the U.S. Treasury, close factories and send the jobs overseas, gut social service programs and impose austerity. They have, at the same time, militarized our police, built the most sophisticated security and surveillance apparatus in human history and used judicial fiat to strip us of our civil liberties. They are ready should we rise up in defiance. These mandarins are, if we speak in the language of God and country, traitors. They are parasites. Financial speculation in 17th-century England was a crime. Speculators were hanged. The heads of most of [today's] banks and hedge funds and the executives of large corporations, such as Walmart and Gap, that run sweatshop death traps for impoverished workers overseas deserve prison far more than most of the poor students of color I teach within the prison system, people who never had a fair trial or a chance in life. When a tiny cabal seizes power -- monarchist, communist, fascist or corporate--it creates a mafia economy and a mafia state. Donald Trump is not an anomaly. He is the grotesque visage of a collapsed democracy. Trump and his coterie of billionaires, generals, half-wits, Christian fascists, criminals, racists and deviants play the role of the Snopes clan in some of William Faulkner's novels. The Snopeses filled the power vacuum of the decayed South and ruthlessly seized control from the degenerated, former slave-holding aristocratic elites. Flem Snopes and his extended family -- which includes a killer, a pedophile, a bigamist, an arsonist, a mentally disabled man who copulates with a cow, and a relative who sells tickets to witness the bestiality -- are fictional representations of the scum now elevated to the highest level of the federal government. They embody the moral rot unleashed by unfettered capitalism. - Advertisement - "The usual reference to 'amorality,' while accurate, is not sufficiently distinctive and by itself does not allow us to place them, as they should be placed, in a historical moment," the critic Irving Howe wrote of the Snopeses. "Perhaps the most important thing to be said is that they are what comes afterwards: the creatures that emerge from the devastation, with the slime still upon their lips." "Let a world collapse, in the South or Russia, and there appear figures of coarse ambition driving their way up from beneath the social bottom, men to whom moral claims are not so much absurd as incomprehensible, sons of bushwhackers or muzhiks drifting in from nowhere and taking over through the sheer outrageousness of their monolithic force," Howe wrote. "They become presidents of local banks and chairmen of party regional committees, and later, a trifle slicked up, they muscle their way into Congress or the Politburo. Scavengers without inhibition, they need not believe in the crumbling official code of their society; they need only learn to mimic its sounds." What comes next, history has shown, will not be pleasant. A corrupt and inept ruling elite, backed by the organs of state security and law enforcement, will unleash a naked kleptocracy. Workers will become serfs. The most benign dissent will be criminalized. The ravaging of the ecosystem propels us towards extinction. Hate talk will call for attacks against Muslims, undocumented workers, African-Americans, feminists, intellectuals, artists and dissidents, all of whom will be scapegoated for the country's stagnation. Magical thinking will dominate our airwaves and be taught in our public schools. Art and culture will be degraded to nationalist kitsch. All the cultural and intellectual disciplines that allow us to view the world from the perspective of the other, that foster empathy, understanding and compassion, will be replaced by a grotesque and cruel hyper-masculinity and hyper-militarism. Those in power will validate racism, bigotry, misogyny and homophobia. Our only hope now is an unwavering noncooperation with the systems of corporate control. We must rebuild ... democratic institutions from the ground up. We must not be seduced into trusting the power elites, including the Democratic Party, whose seven leading candidates to be the next chair of the Democratic National Committee demonstrated the other night at George Washington University that they have no interest in defying corporate power or backing democratic populism. We must also acknowledge our own failures on the left, our elitism, arrogance and refusal to root our politics locally in our communities. Rosa Luxemburg understood that unless we first address the most pressing economic and physical needs of the destitute we will never gain credibility or build a resistance movement. Revolt, she said, is achieved only by building genuine relationships, including with people who do not think like us. Revolt surges up from below, exemplified by the water protectors at Standing Rock.

Before you " p r o t e s t " you need a plan and need to be organized. For example, the recent women's protest was for naught. Trump's first tweet ... from the gut ... was basically stating you lost, get over it. His second tweet was most likely urged on him not to alienate the public on his first couple of days in office. You see, he's only " r e s p o n s I b l e " to those who voted for him .. he doesn't owe the rest of the country a thing ... you didn't vote for him so you don't matter ... if you want to challenge him, fine - see you in 4 years. Of the 200 million plus eligible voters, Trump only has to satisfy 62 million and no more. Belly-ache all you want, just make sure you can afford to pay the doctor because ObamaCare is no more. But if you care, then start by building a new Democratic Party and avoid the mistakes of the one Miss Hillary and the super delegates destroyed. What's more, make sure you secure firm foundations ... they're what you'll protest over instead of some whimsical idea of a wrong that should be righted.

Doing as you say is necessary and critical but hardly sufficient. Protesting and resisting at every turn must be a way of life and for some of us always has been. OTOH I'm sure you can have a nice plan along with a nice grave in four years.

If you see a mother beating her child, you do not organize and make a plan. You jump between them and yell Stop! Organizing and planning come both before and after the response to criminality. Hedges is preaching; let him express his outrage, detail he crimes, and call us to action. My plan is simple: challenge every lie, expose every attempt to scapegoat, but at 75, I can still march and show my revolt in a way that cannot be ignored. Trump, during a time when all Presidents have been happy, is miserable and angry because he knows he does not have the support of most Americans and that they will not be silent. We have already had this effect, to rob him of the elation that follows true victory. We remind him that he stole the election, that he is not popular, that he is mistrusted. The danger is that those who rule without the tailwind of popular support must use force, threats, and lies to try to compell obedience. We saw this with Hitler and Mussolini and Bush II, all of whom did not win their elections but took power....all led to disaster. I urge you join us and learn the love and deep connection that comes with struggle. Not only can you help create positive values (when we oppose injustice, we affirm justice; when we opposed hatred, we affirm love) but you will be transformed into a fully human being, not a sideline heckler complaining about "whimsical" ideas. There is nothing whimsical about revolution. Do you think in the ten totalitarian nations which were transformed by peaceful protests in 1989 that they all had a detailed plan before they gathered? They had many ideas, many plans...but first came the primal act of revolt, the convergence of people seeking to defeat hatred with love, oppression with freedom. I often disagree with Hedges, but he is right to say that only revolt can stop the fascist Trump agenda: do what you can, march, right, challenge lies....but join us in a transformative experience not only for yourself but for the entire world which stands aghast at how such a reckless fraud now has his fingers on the levers of war and oppression. Join us and bring your plans!

A few quotes from Dr. King might be helpful to put what happened Sunday and the critics in perspective: " History will have to record that the greatest tragedy of this period of social transition was not the strident clamor of the bad people, but the appalling silence of the good people." " He who passively accepts evil is as much involved in it as he who helps perpetrate it. He who accepts evil without protesting against it is really cooperating with it. *** We are at the moment when our lives must be placed on the line if our nation is to survive its own folly. Every man of humane convictions must decide on the protest that best suits his convictions, but we must all protest." The protests in DC and worldwide were well organized and uniformly peaceful. Trump heard us clear and loud and has had to resort to "alternative facts (ie lies)" to address the evidence that he governs without consent (ie rules unjustly,to use the words of the Declaration of Independence.). No one is against organizing but first there must be the organic response of revolt to organize. Just as you say we will be made fools of, J. Edgar Hoover said Dr. King was a great liar. My view is that those who cannot provide current evidence (that Trump will count on "disorganized protesting to prove he's in control" seal their argument with predictions which can neither be refuted or proved. Trump is in control of the state apparatus but not of public opinion. The more he lies about us, the more his approval falls. That is why some polls now show is approval at 32%. Bluster and lies will not win him more support but expose him to more revolt. That is my prediction, based on the evidence of history, where unpopular leaders use wars, threats, and lies....and end up losing all support, often after terrible disasters. I predict Trump's lies and threats will only show he is not in control of public opinion...and, tragically, a standard way to deal with that is to start a war to rally support. It often works, in the short fun: Bush II who started with about 55% support, saw it rise into the 90's, and then fall into the 20's. Mussolini was hung in the streets of Rome. Hitler goes down as the most evil man in history. All rallied support, having lost elections by waging war...and destroying their countries and ending up hated. Trump starts out hated......by about 2/3 of the public. I predict: epic failure. My evidence: history. Those without the tailwind of public support can rule only with violence, intimidation, and lies...and in the end, that leads to disaster. That is the lesson of history. Did you protest Sunday? Or are you throwing criticism from the sidelines? The only way to understand organic revolt is to be part of it. We welcome organizing, educating, etc but not from the outside. Join us and help us organize. Submitted on Monday, Jan 23, 2017 at 9:58:25 PM     (0+)   Lee Beacham (Member since May 30, 2015), 225 comments    Trump is the Revolt.

Recently I made an error in stating that both parties had voted for the 1913 Federal REserve Act, when in fact this was true in the House but not the Senate. I was called on it and admitted my mistake. The party that then denounced me failed to admit he was wrong about the House vote. And so it goes. When wrong, I admit my mistake. I do that as a matter of honor and my desire to be right. Sadly, those who jump on us when we admit a mistake are too cowardly to apply the same standard to themselves. Reagan was actually very good on nukes but he did start 6 secret and illegal wars, killing millions. I predict that the verbal bullies who are attacking the protesters will never admit they were wrong. It takes courage to admit you were wrong. In 99% of the cases when I refute lies with evidence, the liars turn to personal insults and never correct themselves. That is why we will win: we are both right (almost all the time) and have the courage to admit mistakes. I wear the personal attacks as a sign I have touched a nerve and as a badge of honor. In a time of lies (or "alternative facts," as Trump's propagandist called Trump's lies), those who speak the truth are attacked and demonized. I wish I were wrong about Trump being a fraud and a fascist...........I wish I were wrong about most of the disasters I have been foreseen. Sadly, I have a record of being right, from the lies that promoted the Vietnam War to predicting Trump's electoral victory. How I wish I were wrong....

Yesterday, Trump's Goebbles, KellyAnne Conway, told Chuck Todd (who has finally located his balls) that the lies Todd said Trump had stated about crowd size could be countered with "alternate facts." Todd, for once in his life, did not roll over but answered.... " Chuck Todd pressed Trump senior adviser Kellyanne Conway about why the White House on Saturday had sent Spicer to the briefing podium for the first time to claim that "this was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration, period." "You're saying it's a falsehood. And they're giving -- Sean Spicer, our press secretary -- gave alternative facts," she said. Todd responded: "Alternative facts aren't facts, they are falsehoods." Conway then tried to pivot to policy points. But later in the interview, Todd pressed Conway again on why the White House sent Spicer out to make false claims about crowd size, asking: "What was the motive to have this ridiculous litigation of crowd size?" "Your job is not to call things ridiculous that are said by our press secretary and our president, responded Conway." Now we have the alt-right (ie racists) advising the President and alt-facts as Orwellian doublespeak for lies. What next? Alt-truth? (post truth, truthiness, bullshit?). Here is the newspeak of the alt-Presidency: When the media calls out Trump's lies, it is fake news. When Trump wants to replace the facts, he has his propaganda minister trot out alternative facts. ""Falsehood flies, and truth comes limping after it, so that when men come to be undeceived, it is too late; the jest is over, and the tale hath had its effect: like a man, who hath thought of a good repartee when the discourse is changed, or the company parted; or like a physician, who hath found out an infallible medicine, after the patient is dead." " Jonathan Swift That is why we must protest, revolt, challenge every single lie..to nip the "alternative truth" in the bud.

In a society where an exploitative class that controls the mainstream narrative uses deception and co-optation to subvert and control what would be otherwise spontaneous social processes it becomes so problematic for the sincere progressive to be able to determine friend from foe that it becomes, without further specialized efforts, practically impossible. Part of what makes it possible to control people is to confuse people enough to just go along with what appears to have the momentum, and the established con artists and their minions are experts at obfuscation designed precisely to this end. They can't stop people from reaching natural conclusions to naturally applied logic and reason but they can cultivate a tribal emotionalism and group think that is extremely hostile to independent dissent and call that progress. In other words, any revolution in a society that has not developed the cultural means of creating a genuine community of sincere people open to social progress and studied self-examination is at least as likely to start out participating in revolts staged and managed by those supposedly being revolted against as they are to be engaged in genuine revolt. Revolt is needed but even more than that we need to find ways to organize as communities with explicitly shared ends where both the self-identified right and left can begin to negotiate on what to join together to bring about or avoid. The simple reality is that victims have more in common with each other than with those victimizing them, but they need to get beyond the emotional reactions of the trauma of being victimized just to realize it.

There will be plenty to criticize once his policies become evident without having to resort to an extended personal attack regardless of how much he may have it coming. Attacking Trump the person and not also the policies of the Democratic establishment that made him possible is counterproductive and will be used by the establishment for it's own purposes.

False flags are the modus operandi of the shadow government. I am pretty sure that the historical precedent for these sorts of deceptions span millenia. Some can accept historical accounts of deep state operations remote in time, or in remote theatres, but can not fathom that to covert operatives, the theatre is irrelevant, and people are expendable regardless of where they are. Ruthless mercenaries or ideologues have few qualms about killing foreigners, brutally, in large numbers. They have no compunction when it comes causing large numbers of their own to to be sent off to kill or be killed in foreign lands. Why in the world would they hesitate to do the same on their own soil? Counter objections such as "someone would have talked", "they could not keep a secret", "they would not be so bold", "the government is incompetent" have been well rebutted by others as rather lame debating points.With 9/11, the forensic evidence for atypical explosive demolition of two towers, and classic explosive demolition of a third - not hit by an airplane - is extraordinary strong. Chris Hedges is one of many progressive writers who ignore this aspect of the political world. It means that their analysis is woefully incomplete, inaccurate. I won't speculate as to motivation to ignore or denigrate those who do think is vitally important to address these things. With respect to Trump, I am still of the opinion that he is a cipher in many respects. Those who are certain that they understand the man, his motivations, and even his deep state connections are possessed of a certainty of opinion which I feel to be wholly unjustified.

His lies are as big as Hitler's. The people of New York, who know him best, know he is a criminal, a fraud, a pretender. In Manhatten and the Bronx, he got less than 10% of the vote. Personnel is policy: Trump has signaled his desire for an authoritarian state, war on Iran (military ally of Russia and China), deportation of our most unprotected population, cutting environmental regulations 75%, spending more on the military, and putting ultranationalism (the essence of fascism) outfront. He is no cipher; he is the face of American fascism, celebrated by the KKK and the American Nazi party, and now defending his lies as "alternative facts." My views are based on evidence, his own words, his choices of staff, and his history as a fraud and crook. Most Americans (60-70%/ agree with my assessment. Those who want to give him a chance are overlooking his Big Lies, his history of racism and deception, and the fact that he asked Russia to intervene to give him the victory. It is not a victory (even he knows that) but a huge tragedy for all of us. it is not entrails but history and evidence we are reading when we, the vast majoritiy of Americans, say NO to the fake that is Donald Trump.

The reasons not to give Trump a chance: racism, sexism, fascism, nuclear arms race, cutting 75% of environmental regulations, pathological liar, chooses anti-Russian Secy of Defense and CIA, 1000% behind CIA, disturbed and disorganized thinking, authoritarian narcissist. The best we can do is restrain him with massive public opposition, as last weekednd, and then replace him as quickly as possible. Would you have given Hitler a chance in 1933?

His approval rating is between 30-40%. Most Americans disapprove. He was not elected; he was selected by 538 party hacks in an institution designed by slave owners to ensure their rule over the new nation, now ruled by banks and oligarchs like Trump and his cabinet. Any time the actual election results are reversed, that is a coup. In a democracy, majority rules. Institutions which overturn the majority to put the minority in power are legal coups. "Everything Hitler did was legal." MLK. Trumps CIA chief and Secy of Defense have both declared Russia enemy #1. You have been suckered.

By Paul Douglas January 22, 2017 — 10:33pm Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on: Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink: Purchase: Order Reprint 4th of 5th Longest January Thaw on Record for MSP "March-uary"? I seriously overslept. I went to bed in mid-January - woke up in late March, complete with pond-size puddles and a few dreary piles of dirty snow. March-like mud and mush in my sloppy yard. Most years we enjoy a January Thaw, but this one has been super-sized. We may go 11 days in a row with highs above freezing; the 4th longest stretch since 1872, according to Dr. Mark Seeley. To say it's been an odd winter would be an understatement: we flip-flop between subzero outbreaks and freakish, midwinter rains. Where's the snow? The next system tracks from Denver to Milwaukee, brushing us with a few inches of slushy snow late Tuesday into Wednesday morning. Freeways may stay wet and slushy, but a little ice may return later in the week as temperatures finally drop into the 20s. No bitter blasts brewing until (maybe) the second week of February. Our weather is a 2 on the Whine-O-Meter. Killer tornadoes hit the south over the weekend; a parade of massive storms pummeling California with flooding and mudslides. We have precious little to complain about. It looks like Seattle outside my window. Yes, January has mellowed - but don't let your guard down just yet. Super-Sized January Thaw. Here's more perspective on this current of temperatures above 32F, courtesy of Dr. Mark Seeley and Minnesota WeatherTalk: "...The proverbial "January Thaw" (two or more consecutive days with daily high temperatures greater than freezing) for the Twin Cities has historically about an 80 percent probability of occurrence (about a 91 percent probability since 1980 with a pronounced urban heat island effect). This January it is happening to us with an exclamation mark! We may have up to 10 consecutive days with daily high temperatures above freezing if the forecast through January 26th verifies. In this context it would be the 5th longest such streak in the Twin Cities climate records surpassed only by 18 days in January 1944, 15 days in January 1942, 13 days in January 1919, and 11 days in January 1880 and 1909. (thanks to NOAA's Michelle Margraf and DNR-SCO's Pete Boulay for pointing this out). Over 50 Minnesota climate stations have already reported daytime highs in the 40s F this week, including 48°F at both Grand Rapids and Forest Lake on the 18th..." Rainy Nor'easter - More Storms for California. The 84-hour 12 KM NAM shows the southeast drying out, after a weekend of severe storms and large, April-like tornadoes. A powerful storm pushes up the east coast with a cold rain for major cities from Washington D.C. to New York and Boston; ice and heavy wet snow well inland. Meanwhile California sees more rain (not as heavy or violent as Sunday's storm) and a storm tracking from near Denver to Milwaukee will push a few inches of wet, slushy snow across the Midwest and Upper Mississippi Valley Tuesday into Wednesday. Loop: Tropicaltidbits.com. 84-Hour Snowfall Potential. It's a model, not reality, but looking at NOAA's NAM guidance from the 00z run you get a pretty good idea who may see plowable amounts of snow into Thursday morning: Poconos into much of interior New England - South Dakota into central and southern Minnesota and Wisconsin and the heavy snow continues to pile up across the Rockies. What a winter for skiers out west, about as good as it gets. Twin Cities Snowfall: Potentially Plowable. Models print out 2-4" of snow from late Tuesday into Wednesday afternoon; most freeways will stay wet and slushy with temperatures at or just above 32F, but a few inches may accumulate on side streets and driveways by Wednesday morning. Screen shot: Aeris Weather Pulse app. Above Average Into Early February. The 15-Day numbers from the ECMWF (European) show temperatures in the Twin Cities consistently above average into the first week of February. Source: WeatherBell. Brief Cold Correction Middle of Next Week? NOAA models, specifically the GFS model ensembles, show single digit wake-up temperatures a week from Wednesday, followed by a fairly speedy recovery. With a higher sun angle in February it gets increasingly difficult for (sustained) subzero days and nights. Not impossible, but the negative numbers usually don't last as long as they do in January. Graphic: Aeris Enterprise. Premature to Retire the Parkas. Long-range GFS guidance pulls another subzero lobe of air across the Upper Mississippi Valley and Great Lakes after February 6; maybe a few days of minor pain before a milder Pacific flow resumes.  February? Flip a Coin. NOAA's long-range CFSv2 (Climate Forecast System) continues to flip-flop between warm and cold solutions, so confidence levels are exceedingly low, but the latest model runs hint at a warm/east and cold/west solution. 10-15F warmer than average for the Mid Atlantic next month? I have my doubts - we'll see. February temperature anomalies: WeatherBell. Putting High Risk Severe Outbreaks Into Perspective. An average of 51 to 62 tornadoes? I learned something at ustornadoes.com; Ian Livingston takes a look at the average number of tornadoes during high-risk severe days since 2000, as defined by NOAA SPC: "Looking at the averages from these events, the numbers are fairly stark. Since any small sample that includes April 27, 2011 is going to be skewed more than normal, I’ll share the figures with and without it included (these are 15 and 14 event averages respectively): With 4/27/2011: Average high risk has 62 tornadoes, 16 of which are strong (EF2+), and two are violent (EF4-5). Four killer tornadoes occur on average, causing 31 deaths. The deadliest averages 10 killed. The longest track tornado averages 58.0 miles. Without 4/27/2011: Average high risk has 51 tornadoes, 13 of which are strong, and one is violent. Two killer tornadoes occur on average, causing 11 deaths. The deadliest averages six killed. The longest track tornado averages 52.7 miles..." More April than January. The forecast of a major tornado outbreak for the southeast on Sunday verified. There was plenty of advance warning from NOAA, trusted sources on social media and both local and national media. Here's an excerpt of a corporate briefing we sent to our clients yesterday morning: AerisWeather Briefing: Issued Sunday, January 22nd, 2017: A significant tornado outbreak, with multiple strong, long-tracked tornadoes is likely across northern Florida and southern Georgia today. A HIGH RISK of severe weather is in place for parts of Alabama, Georgia and Florida due to this threat. The cities at highest threat include Jacksonville, Tallahassee, Gainesville (FL) as well as Savannah and Albany (GA). However, the threat for tornadoes, hail and wind extend from southern Alabama into the Carolinas and across the entire Florida panhandle into the evening hours. Significant Severe Weather Event. For only the 19th time since 2010, and the first time since June of 2014, the Storm Prediction Center has issued a HIGH RISK of severe weather for today. The threat exists across portions of extreme southeast Alabama, southern Georgia and northern Florida. This is out mainly for the threat of numerous tornadoes as we head through the day today, some of which could be strong and long-tracked. The area where the highest risk of severe weather is expected today includes Jacksonville, Tallahassee, Gainesville (FL) as well as Savannah and Albany (GA). However, significant severe weather, including tornadoes, wind and hail are possible throughout the Florida panhandle and into the Carolinas into the evening hours as well. Tornado Threat. It is not often that there is a 30% probability of tornadoes in a 25 mile radius of a point in the tornado threat map. This is indicative of an environment ripe for multiple tornadoes as we head through the day today, even with tornado warnings in place this morning across parts of the region. The black hatched marks indicate the greatest potential of strong (EF-2 strength or higher), long-tracked tornadoes as we go through the day today and even into the evening that could cause significant damage across the region. Tornado Potential. Our Tornado Potential Index continues to show a heightened risk of tornadoes starting this morning across parts of the Gulf Coast, moving into southern Georgia and northern Florida into the afternoon. This threat continues into the Carolinas and across parts of the Florida peninsula into the evening. This shows that conditions will be more than favorable for rotating, tornado-producing storms. Map credit: AerisWeather. Timing The Storms. Besides ongoing strong to severe weather this morning across parts of Georgia, another round of storms has started up this morning across portions of Alabama and the panhandle of Florida. These storms will move across the severe weather threatened areas as we head through the day today. These storms will have the potential for strong, long-tracked tornadoes as well as damaging winds and hail. The threat for tornadoes will continue into the evening hours across the Carolinas, with the threat of overnight tornadoes. At the same time this evening/overnight, a line of storms will be moving across the Florida Peninsula, capable of damaging winds and a few tornadoes. Timeline: AerisWeather. The other big weather story: More heavy rains pushing into California: Flooding California Rains. The flood threat continues across California as we head through the day today and into the early week, as round three of precipitation hits the west coast. Another 1-4" of rain for areas like San Francisco, Los Angeles, and San Diego will result in urban flooding and potentially significant stream and river flooding over the next couple days. Flash Flood Watches. Due to the heavy rain threat on top of already saturated soil, numerous flash flood watches are in effect into the early week across portions of the Southwest. Map: AerisWeather. Summary. Significant severe weather - especially strong, long-tracked tornadoes - is expected today across portions of the Southeast, including Jacksonville, Tallahassee, Gainesville (FL) as well as Savannah and Albany (GA). This is where an uncommon HIGH RISK of severe weather is in place. Stay alert for potentially life-threatening conditions throughout the day today, and be ready to take action. Out west, heavy rain continues across California today, and another 1-4"+ of rain will continue to lead to flood issues into the early week. D.J. Kayser, Meteorologist, AerisWeather Even Alaskans Are Complaining About the Cold. Here's an excerpt from USA TODAY: "...It's just miserable," Erickson added. "I hate everybody who lives in a warm place." Fairbanks dropped to 50 below zero for the first time in five years Wednesday, Anchorage climatologist Brian Brettschnider said, triggering spooky ice fog across the city. Ice fog occurs when tiny ice particles are suspended in the air when temperatures fall lower than about 22 degrees below zero. It was so cold that schoolkids in Fairbanks this week were forced indoors for recess, he said. When the temperature is colder than 20 degrees below zero in Fairbanks, outdoor recess is canceled, according to the local school district..." Oymyakon: Coldest Inhabited Town On Earth? I think Oymyakdon is Russian for "Oh my God..." Atlas Obscura has a post that will make you feel a little better about the winter you're experiencing; here's an excerpt: "...With a day that varies from 3 hours in the winter to 21 hours in the summer and permanently frozen ground due to the extreme subarctic climate, the roughly 500 residents of Oymyakon are mostly unable to grow crops, therefore their diet basically consists of reindeer and horse meat. While spoiled kids to the south get out of school for snow days, the children of Oymyakon are stuck in class unless the temperature falls below –52C. If you were to go outside naked on an average day, it would take approximately one minute for you to freeze to death. Besides the obvious issues of remoteness, the cold itself forces this village to be a simple place with few conveniences. Cars are hard to start with frozen axle grease and fuel tanks, unused pipes can freeze within 5 hours, batteries lose life at an alarming speed. Pen ink freezes, anything less than fur fails at keeping the chill off, and electronics are all but useless..." GOES 16: True Color Makes a Comeback. Seeing Earth as it really appears? Sounds like a good idea to me - very much looking forward to the new data coming from GOES-R, now known as GOES 16. Here's an excerpt from SSEC at the University of Wisconsin-Madison: "...A familiar yet often overlooked channel, visible light, has made its comeback as part of GOES-16’s Earth-focused instrument, the Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI). Visible light comprises the range of wavelengths that can be seen with the naked eye. A true color image of Earth, which uses that visible light, depicts features like blue oceans, white clouds, and green vegetation, similar to a film camera. “It’s great to see true color come back into the mix,” says Tim Schmit, NOAA satellite research scientist working with researchers at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Cooperative Institute for Meteorological Satellite Studies (CIMSS). “Not only does it help round out the toolkit available on the ABI, but the true color images have long had an impact on how we see our Earth and its weather,” adds Schmit..."

Reuters has the story: "Airbus Group plans to test a prototype for a self-piloted flying car as a way of avoiding gridlock on city roads by the end of the year, the aerospace group's chief executive said on Monday. Airbus last year formed a division called Urban Air Mobility that is exploring concepts such as a vehicle to transport individuals or a helicopter-style vehicle that can carry multiple riders. The aim would be for people to book the vehicle using an app, similar to car-sharing schemes.  "One hundred years ago, urban transport went underground, now we have the technological wherewithal to go above ground," Airbus CEO Tom Enders told the DLD digital tech conference in Munich, adding he hoped the Airbus could fly a demonstration vehicle for single-person transport by the end of the year..."

Turns out the Internet has been anything but a unifying force, for our nation or those engaged in explaining the news of the day, and yet we all seem to live in our curated, "safe" information bubbles every day. Here's an excerpt of a thoughtful piece at Medium: "...Companies from Medium to The Washington Post to Mashable to Buzzfeed all eventually run into the same unthinkable truth: The methods used to fund modern journalism simultaneously undermine trust in the news outlets. Editors, writers, and executives at today’s news outlets are all in a no-win situation where they are forced to contribute to the causes of their own demise to survive. In any other business, companies would try, fail, and another would take its place. This is good and needed. But for news, the failures are happening at a glacial pace and bad actors are profiting as the trustworthiness of our news outlets are breaking down in slow motion. The result is the worst kind of feedback loop, where well-meaning people try to “fix” the news. But instead, those methods erode trust in all news outlets leading to a total breakdown in discourse..." Journalism That Stands Apart. Here's a Report of the 2020 Group at The New York Times. The Highest Places in America. Just in case you were wondering Atlas Obscura has details: "...Each of the 50 states, as well as D.C., has its own such geographic marker, sought out by a particular niche of explorers known as highpointers, which Atlas Obscura writer Thomas Harper described in his account of this elevated subculture.  Scaling each of the state high points means spanning the whole spectrum of the country’s diverse landscape.

Just in case you missed Justin Gillis's report at the New York Times: "...In 2015 and 2016, the planetary warming was intensified by the weather pattern known as El Niño, in which the Pacific Ocean released a huge burst of energy and water vapor into the atmosphere. But the bigger factor in setting the records was the long-term trend of rising temperatures, which scientists say is being driven by increasing levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. “A single warm year is something of a curiosity,” said Deke Arndt, chief of global climate monitoring for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. “It’s really the trend, and the fact that we’re punching at the ceiling every year now, that is the real indicator that we’re undergoing big changes...” Photo credit: "Ice in the Arctic Ocean’s Chukchi Sea region. “What’s going on in the Arctic is really very impressive; this year was ridiculously off the chart,” said Gavin A.

Here's an excerpt from a story at Forbes: "...After the election in November, a bipartisan group of defense experts and former military leaders urged the President-Elect, through the Trump Transition Team, to consider climate change as a grave threat to our national security. In 2014, the Military Advisory Board came out with a report, called National Security and the Accelerating Risks of Climate Change, that discusses what the military sees as the threats of climate change and the actions to be taken to mitigate them: “The potential security ramifications of global climate change should be serving as catalysts for cooperation and change. Instead, climate change impacts are already accelerating instability in vulnerable areas of the world and are serving as catalysts for conflict...” Photo credit: "A U.S. Navy Carrier Strike Group in the South China Sea. The U.S. military is worried that climate change is a significant threat multiplier for future conflicts. And the Navy may bear the brunt of these effects.

I am THRILLED to be BORED. I also love using ALL CAPS, like some of the crazy people who reach out to me on a regular basis. I'm sorry it rained on your daughter's wedding ma'am. For the record I had nothing to do with that. No big storms brewing, temperatures at or even a few degrees above average thru the first week of February; big storms probably tracking south of Minnesota. It's too quiet out there... Blogs January 25 Midwinter Weather Siesta: No Big Storms or Arctic Leakage Next 1-2 Weeks Minnesota meteorologists will have to stretch a little to come up with vaguely interesting things to babble about for the next week or two. Ice depths on area lakes? Another snow drought for central Minnesota. In the meantime I'm heading to Rochester to see what snow looks like, the cosmetic inch or two the metro picked up Tuesday will be gone by Sunday or Monday as temperatures thaw out one more time. This will be the 17th warmer than average month in a row for Minnesota. Blogs January 25 Brushed With Slush - Plowable Amounts Southern Minnesota - Mild Bias Lingers Into Next Week Considering we could be chin-deep in snow, shivering through endless nights of subzero fun, I'm not complaining one bit. A largely cosmetic snowfall today (more of an issue south of the metro, where amounts will be plowable). We cool off a little behind this (alleged) storm, but temperatures climb into the 30s over the weekend and remain milder than average into at least the first few days of February. It's already the longest January stretch above 32F since 1944 and this midwinter pause isn't quite done with us just yet. Blogs January 23 Brushed by plowable snow amounts - worst travel sSouth of MSP tonight Ah, so this is what they mean by "snow". I get it now - water actually freezes into fancy little ice crystals that stick together, gravity pulls them to the ground at an average speed of 3 mph. And traffic grinds to a halt on I-35. It's just snow folks, not billowing clouds of radioactivity. Couple inches of slush for most of us - but enough to lead the news and spark waves of indignant muttering about the weather. Southern Minnesota will see the heaviest snows, enough to shovel and plow and remind locals that they live in a far southern suburb of Winnipeg. Blogs January 22 Super-sized January thaw continues - few slushy inches Tuesday night Yes, it looks more like Seattle (or London) than a typical Minnesota January day outside my window, but who am I to complain? Is 35F and gray better than sunny and 10F? Weather is subjective, but snow lovers and anyone trying to play hockey on an outdoor rink isn't very happy right now. We may see a few inches of slush late Tuesday and temperatures cool off slightly later in the week, but no Siberian Smacks are shaping up. Not yet.

Shipler Women’s T-Shirt $20   Revolt Is the Only Barrier to a Fascist America Posted on Jan 22, 2017 By Chris Hedges   Donald Trump waits to assume power before his inauguration Friday. (Patrick Semansky / AP) This is a transcript of a talk Chris Hedges gave at the Inaugurate the Resistance rally in Washington, D.C., on Saturday. The ruling elites, terrified by the mobilization of the left in the 1960s, or by what [political scientist] Samuel P. Huntington called America’s “excess of democracy,” built counter-institutions to delegitimize and marginalize critics of corporate capitalism and imperialism. They bought the allegiances of the two main political parties. They imposed … obedience to the neoliberal ideology within academia and the press. This campaign, laid out by Lewis Powell in his 1971 memorandum titled “Attack on American Free Enterprise System,” was the blueprint for the creeping corporate coup d’état that 45 years later is complete. The destruction of democratic institutions, places where the citizen has agency and a voice, is far graver than the ascendancy to the White House of the demagogue Donald Trump. The coup destroyed our two-party system. It destroyed labor unions. It destroyed public education. It destroyed the judiciary. It destroyed the press. It destroyed academia. It destroyed consumer and environmental protection. It destroyed our industrial base. It destroyed communities and cities. And it destroyed the lives of tens of millions of Americans no longer able to find work that provides a living wage, cursed to live in chronic poverty or locked in cages in our monstrous system of mass incarceration. This coup also destroyed the credibility of liberal democracy. Self-identified liberals such as the Clintons and Barack Obama mouthed the words of liberal democratic values while making war on these values in the service of corporate power. The revolt we see rippling across the country is a revolt not only against a corporate system that has betrayed workers, but also, for many, liberal democracy itself. This is very dangerous. It will allow the radical right under a Trump administration to cement into place an Americanized fascism. “Ignorance allied with power,” James Baldwin wrote, “is the most ferocious enemy justice can have.” It turns out, 45 years later, that those who truly hate us for our freedoms are not the array of dehumanized enemies cooked up by the war machine—the Vietnamese, Cambodians, Afghans, Iraqis, Iranians or even the Taliban, al-Qaida and ISIS. They are the financiers, bankers, politicians, public intellectuals and pundits, lawyers, journalists and businesspeople cultivated in the elite universities and business schools who sold us the utopian dream of neoliberalism. We are entering the twilight phase of capitalism. Wealth is no longer created by producing or manufacturing. It is created by manipulating the prices of stocks and commodities and imposing a crippling debt peonage on the public. Our casino capitalism has merged with the gambling industry. The entire system is parasitic. It is designed to prey on the desperate—young men and women burdened by student loans, underpaid workers burdened by credit card debt and mortgages, towns and cities forced to borrow to maintain municipal services. Casino magnates such as Sheldon Adelson and hedge fund managers such as Robert Mercer add nothing of value to society. They do not generate money but instead redistribute it upwards to the 1 percent. They use lobbyists and campaign contributions to built monopolies—this is how the drug company Mylan raised the price of an “EpiPen,” used to treat allergy reactions, from $57 in 2007 to about $500—and to rewrite laws and regulations. They have given themselves the legal power to carry out a tax boycott, loot the U.S. Treasury, close factories and send the jobs overseas, gut social service programs and impose austerity. They have, at the same time, militarized our police, built the most sophisticated security and surveillance apparatus in human history and used judicial fiat to strip us of our civil liberties. They are ready should we rise up in defiance. These mandarins are, if we speak in the language of God and country, traitors. They are parasites. Financial speculation in 17th-century England was a crime. Speculators were hanged. The heads of most of [today’s] banks and hedge funds and the executives of large corporations, such as Walmart and Gap, that run sweatshop death traps for impoverished workers overseas deserve prison far more than most of the poor students of color I teach within the prison system, people who never had a fair trial or a chance in life. When a tiny cabal seizes power—monarchist, communist, fascist or corporate—it creates a mafia economy and a mafia state. Donald Trump is not an anomaly. He is the grotesque visage of a collapsed democracy. Trump and his coterie of billionaires, generals, half-wits, Christian fascists, criminals, racists and deviants play the role of the Snopes clan in some of William Faulkner’s novels. The Snopeses filled the power vacuum of the decayed South and ruthlessly seized control from the degenerated, former slave-holding aristocratic elites. Flem Snopes and his extended family—which includes a killer, a pedophile, a bigamist, an arsonist, a mentally disabled man who copulates with a cow, and a relative who sells tickets to witness the bestiality—are fictional representations of the scum now elevated to the highest level of the federal government. They embody the moral rot unleashed by unfettered capitalism. “The usual reference to ‘amorality,’ while accurate, is not sufficiently distinctive and by itself does not allow us to place them, as they should be placed, in a historical moment,” the critic Irving Howe wrote of the Snopeses. “Perhaps the most important thing to be said is that they are what comes afterwards: the creatures that emerge from the devastation, with the slime still upon their lips.” “Let a world collapse, in the South or Russia, and there appear figures of coarse ambition driving their way up from beneath the social bottom, men to whom moral claims are not so much absurd as incomprehensible, sons of bushwhackers or muzhiks drifting in from nowhere and taking over through the sheer outrageousness of their monolithic force,” Howe wrote. “They become presidents of local banks and chairmen of party regional committees, and later, a trifle slicked up, they muscle their way into Congress or the Politburo. Scavengers without inhibition, they need not believe in the crumbling official code of their society; they need only learn to mimic its sounds.” Advertisement Square, Site wide 1   2   NEXT PAGE >>> Keep up with Chris Hedges’ latest columns, interviews, tour dates and more at www.truthdig.com/chris_hedges.

I was sad. Bartolo Carone was super at his job. Several times during the year, I have had to put a vacation hold on my paper and he always got the start and stop dates correct. Always! (As a side note, I cannot say the same thing for the post office. Not even close.) I always sent Carone a little extra at Christmas. I hope it was enough. I truly appreciate him and his work ethic. I wish him well. And I hope someone just as conscientious has picked up the route. Thank you, Bartolo Carone. Debra Beckham, Plano 2 To Dallas police officers -- When our son and family recently arrived at Love Field, the passenger pickup was a madhouse, our daughter-in-law was ill, and with two little ones we were a little too eager to get home. We had left two bags on the curb. We called, no bags found. I drove back to Love Field at midnight, no bags found, nothing reported. I left a business card with one of the Dallas Police Department officers. After 1 a.m. he texted me -- the bags had been found. He also left several messages (I was asleep). The next morning I followed up, and the officer on duty made a call, found the bags and called me back. He waited patiently for us until we arrived and, after identification, we received the bags. Our family expresses the deepest gratitude for the great work of the Dallas Police Department at Love Field. Thom Aldredge, Dallas/Lochwood 3 To kind strangers -- Our house burned down recently. My family and dogs are alive and fine, but we've never been through this before and have been in a kind of hazy shock. The next day I was in line at Wal-Mart with a cartload of gloves, rubber boots and other necessities. Wearing clothing and slippers from heroically generous and loving friends and neighbors, I found myself at the front of a long line of other customers, with a cart of merchandise costing about $350. I had not grabbed enough cash for my purchases and, still somewhat in shock, I absent-mindedly expressed my apologies to those in line behind me, saying our house had burned down. The beautiful woman next in line to me, Pat, I believe is her name, and her sister, Carla, took no time in saying, "I got this. Go. Your family is waiting for you." You so kindly refused to give me your full name or number. So, other than telling as many people as I can this heartwarming story, I'm hoping you will see this letter. I hope your kindness and generosity will bring genuine smiles to others. The best way, I bet, for us to repay your great kindness is to do this for others, which we certainly will. Thank you infinitely. Elizabeth C. Young, North Dallas Three Cheers is a collection of upbeat letters that inspire readers to think and act positively.

Done Editing Tags 304 Comments Share this article 136 136 136 President Obama at his final press conference, January 18, 2017 Donald Trump’s unexpected Electoral College win has focused attention on the white working-class voters that, it is claimed, the elitist Democratic Party no longer appears to represent. Of course, the Democratic Party has never stopped representing them. We have just never used fear and anger to convince the voters of that representation. Being Democrats, we will continue our navel gazing and internal strife as we slowly come to terms with the November election results. But we should remember that the Democratic candidate did win the popular vote by a substantial margin and that we continue to represent the white working class, as well as the rest of the American people. In addition to being accused of elitism, a new meme making the rounds lately claims we lost the election because we think that we are morally and intellectually superior—although it is never made quite clear who we think we are morally and intellectually superior to. If it is the members of the Republican Party who are proposed to run the government under Donald Trump? Then yes, we clearly are superior. Nominated for secretary of education, Betsy DeVos is totally unaware of the difference between proficiency and growth in standardized testing, as pointed out by Sen. Al Franken. Although not nominated for the position, Franken demonstrably knew more about the issues the secretary would face. And while everyone is aware that she believes guns are needed in schools to protect against possible grizzly bear attacks, some may have missed her initial refusal to admit that the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act trumps state laws. The current secretary of education since March 2016 is John King. He has spent his adult lifetime involved in education, including service as the commissioner of education for the state of New York prior to joining the federal Department of Education in 2011. Betsy DeVos has no experience in public education, nor have any of her children ever been exposed to it. Rick Perry, former governor of Texas, has been proposed as secretary of the Department of Energy. That’s a department he claimed he wanted to eliminate during in his 2012 presidential bid—if he could ever remember its name. According to the New York Times report on his nomination: If approved by the Senate, he will take over from a secretary, Ernest J. Moniz, who was chairman of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology physics department and directed the linear accelerator at M.I.T.’s Laboratory for Nuclear Science. Before Mr. Moniz, the job belonged to Steven Chu, a physicist who won a Nobel Prize. For Mr. Moniz, the future of nuclear science has been a lifelong obsession; he spent his early years working at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center. Mr. Perry studied animal husbandry and led cheers at Texas A&M University. Mr. Moniz had such deep experience with nuclear weapons that in 2015, President Obama made him a co-negotiator, along with Secretary of State John Kerry, of the Iran nuclear deal. Donald Trump wants Tom Price to run the Department of Health and Human Services. His apparent qualifications include the ability to shape legislation to benefit the stockholders (including himself) of corporations in the medical field. Unlike Perry or DeVos, he at least has a tangential connection to the field in which he is tagged to advise the president. Democratic Rep. Louise Slaughter of New York has asked the SEC to investigate. The request to investigate Rep. Tom Price, a Georgia Republican, comes after The Wall Street Journal reported last month that he made trades worth more than $300,000 in stocks of biomedical, pharmaceutical and health insurers while serving on the health subcommittee of the House Ways and Means Committee, sponsoring and advocating legislation that potentially could affect those companies’ stock. In addition to suspected insider trading, he is unalterably opposed to contraception, according to Amanda Marcotte. This despite the fact that wide access to contraception has been credited with the largest drop in abortions since Roe v. Wade. Price has been quite open about his hostility to contraception. As a member of Congress, he has voted to terminate Title X, a program that subsidizes contraception for low-income women. He voted against a law barring employers from firing women for using contraception. He hates Planned Parenthood and he really hates the federal regulation, under the Affordable Care Act, that requires insurance plans to cover contraception without a copay. To justify his opposition to insurance coverage for contraception, Price sneeringly told ThinkProgress in 2012, “Bring me one woman who has been left behind” by plans that don’t cover contraception adequately. Not that the Affordable Care Act is expected to survive the Republican government that was elected in November. Current Secretary of Health and Human Services Sylvia Mathews Burwell has extensive experience in managing large complex organizations, most recently as director of the Office of Management and Budget. Before her most recent federal service, Burwell served as head of the Walmart Foundation, supervising the distribution of $1 billion to help end hunger and empower women around the world. Before joining the Foundation in 2012, she was President of the Global Development Program at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in Seattle, Washington, where she spent 10 years working on some of the world’s most pressing challenges, from vaccinations to children’s health to agricultural development. She also served as the Foundation’s first Chief Operating Officer. Price, meanwhile, was a physician and a member of Congress. I watched President Obama’s press conference last week with a great deal of regret, remembering how proud I was during his first one. There was not a single question to which he did not respond in complete sentences and organized paragraphs. His answers were clear and, while often complex, totally spontaneous. Donald Trump, terrified of the press, is considering removing them from the White House and intends to continue communicating with the American people via social media. x .@NBCNews is bad but Saturday Night Live is the worst of NBC.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 18, 2017 As for being morally superior, I will proudly stand with men and women like the Rev. William Barber of North Carolina, who began the Moral Monday movement to fight back against the Republican agenda of voter suppression in North Carolina. Meanwhile, the Republicans offer us Franklin Graham, a purveyor of hate and intolerance under the flag of Christ. Their version of morality calls for the wealthy to increase their wealth while millions of children in America go to bed hungry for food and for education. Their morality dictates corporate tax subsidies instead of decent housing, education, and medical care for all Americans. It sees women only as incubators and homemakers. It is a morality that invests in weapons systems rather than roads, bridges, airports, and schools. And it is this morality, this supposed Christian morality, that they want made mandatory. Perhaps the reason that so many of us appear to think that we are morally and intellectually superior is that we are. 304 Comments Share this article 136 136 136 304 Comments Comment Settings Close Settings Auto refresh Collapse on load Show hidden Show until I hide Comments are closed on this story.

Close share panel Image copyright IBM Image caption Joseph Woodland explaining his prototype scanner in 1952 In 1948, N Joseph Woodland - a graduate student at the Drexel Institute in Philadelphia - was pondering a challenge from a local retailer: how to speed up the tedious process of checking out in his stores by automating transactions. A smart young man, Woodland - known as Joseph - had worked on the Manhattan Project during the War, and had designed a better system for playing elevator music. But he was stumped. Then, sitting on Miami Beach while visiting his parents, his fingertips idly combing through the sand, a thought struck him. Just like Morse code used dots and dashes to convey a message, he could use thin lines and thick lines to encode information. A zebra-striped bull's-eye could describe a product and its price in a code that a machine could read. The idea was workable, but with the technology of the time it was costly. But as computers advanced and lasers were invented, it became more realistic.

The striped-scan system was independently rediscovered and refined several times over the years. In the 1950s, an engineer, David Collins, put thin and thick lines on railway cars so they could be read automatically by a trackside scanner. In the early 1970s, IBM engineer George Laurer figured out that a rectangle would be more compact than Woodland's bull's-eye. He developed a system that used lasers and computers that were so quick they could process labelled beanbags hurled over the scanner. Retailers v producers Joseph Woodland's seaside doodles had become a technological reality. Meanwhile American's grocers were also pondering the benefits of a pan-industry product code. In September 1969, members of the administrative systems committee of the Grocery Manufacturers of America met their opposite numbers from the National Association of Food Chains. Could the retailers and the producers agree? Image copyright Alamy Image caption Wrigley's chewing gum would be the first product sold via a barcode in 1974 The GMA wanted an 11-digit code, which would encompass various labelling schemes they were already using. The NAFC wanted a shorter, seven-digit code, which could be read by simpler and cheaper checkout systems. The meeting broke up in frustration. Years of careful diplomacy - and innumerable committees, subcommittees and ad hoc committees were required before, finally, the US grocery industry agreed upon a standard for the universal product code, or UPC. It all came to fruition in June 1974 at the checkout counter of Marsh's Supermarket in the town of Troy, Ohio, when a 31-year-old checkout assistant named Sharon Buchan scanned a 10-pack of 50 sticks of Wrigley's juicy fruit chewing gum across a laser scanner, automatically registering the price of $0.67 (£0.55). Shifting power The gum was sold. The barcode had been born. We tend to think of the barcode as a simple piece of cost-cutting technology: it helps supermarkets do their business more efficiently, and so it helps us to enjoy lower prices. But the barcode does more than that. It changes the balance of power in the grocery industry. That is why all those committee meetings were necessary, and it is why the food retailing industry was able to reach agreement only when the technical geeks on the committees were replaced by their bosses' bosses, the chief executives. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Barcode technology required a significant investment for smaller retailers Part of the difficulty was getting everyone to move forward on a system that did not really work without a critical mass of adopters. It was expensive to install scanners. It was expensive to redesign packaging with barcodes - bear in mind the Miller Brewing Company was still printing labels for its bottles on a 1908 printing press. The retailers did not want to install scanners until the manufacturers had put barcodes on their products. The manufacturers did not want to put barcodes on their products until the retailers had installed enough scanners. But it also became apparent over time that the barcode was changing the tilt of the playing field in favour of a certain kind of retailer. For a small, family-run convenience store, the barcode scanner was an expensive solution to problems they did not really have. But big supermarkets could spread the cost of the scanners across many more sales. They valued shorter lines at the checkout. They needed to keep track of inventory. More from Tim Harford The iPhone at 10: How the smartphone became so smart How fertiliser helped feed the world The steel box that changed global trade The hidden strengths of unloved concrete With a manual checkout, a shop assistant might charge a customer for a product, then slip the cash into a pocket without registering the sale. With a barcode and scanner system, such behaviour would become conspicuous. And in the 1970s, a time of high inflation in America, barcodes let supermarkets change the price of products by sticking a new price tag on the shelf rather than on each item. The benefits of scale It is hardly surprising that as the barcode spread in the 1970s and 1980s, large retailers also expanded. The scanner data underpinned customer databases and loyalty cards. By tracking and automating inventory, it made just-in-time deliveries more attractive, and lowered the cost of having a wide variety of products. Shops in general - and supermarkets in particular - started to generalise, selling flowers, clothes, and electronic products. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Wal-Mart founder Sam Walton was able to exploit the possibilities barcodes offered Running a huge, diversified, logistically complex operation was all so much easier in the world of the barcode. Perhaps the ultimate expression of that fact came in 1988 when the discount department store Wal-Mart decided to start selling food. It is now the largest grocery chain in America - and by far the largest general retailer on the planet, about as large as its five closest rivals combined. Wal-Mart was an early adopter of the barcode and has continued to invest in cutting-edge computer-driven logistics and inventory management. The company is now a major gateway between Chinese manufacturers and American consumers. Its embrace of technology helped it grow to a vast scale, meaning it can send buyers to China and commission cheap products in bulk. From a Chinese manufacturer's perspective, you can justify setting up an entire production line for just one customer - as long as that customer is Wal-Mart. Image copyright Ian G Dagnall / Alamy Stock Photo Image caption The cost of adopting barcodes initially put off some manufacturers such as Miller Geeks rightly celebrate the moment of inspiration as Joseph Woodland languidly pulled his fingers through the sands of Miami Beach - or the perspiration of George Laurer as he perfected the barcode as we know it. But it is not just a way to do business more efficiently. It also changes what kind of business can be efficient. The barcode is now such a symbol of the forces of impersonal global capitalism that it has spawned its own ironic protest. Since the 1980s, people have been registering their opposition to "The Man" by getting themselves tattooed with a barcode. That countercultural fashion statement recognises something important. Yes, those distinctive black and white stripes are a neat little piece of engineering. But that neat little piece of engineering has changed how the world economy fits together. Tim Harford writes the Financial Times's Undercover Economist column. 50 Things That Made the Modern Economy is broadcast on the BBC World Service.

Slideshow Taking it to the hoop, wheelchair-style Advertisment of Gallery: Facebook icon Twitter icon Pinterest Mail icon Unsmiling and laser-focused, she dribbled, passed, and spun around to block the wheelchairs of her Bennett Blazers opponents with game-face intensity that hid the pure joy she feels whenever she and her Katie's Komets teammates play. "I started when I was eight and I was not really feeling it," Kolander, who lives in Collegeville, said afterward. "I was scared, afraid of jamming my fingers. But my mom wouldn't let me quit. My dad wouldn't let me quit. Nobody would let me quit. So I got over the fear. And as I played, I got much more aggressive." Hosted by Katie's Komets, the 19th Annual Katie Kirlin Junior Wheelchair Basketball Tournament ended Sunday for four teams in the Prep Division (ages 13 and under) and five teams in the Varsity Division (14 through high school graduation). The teams are coed and hailed from Virginia, Maryland, New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Katie's Komets finished fourth; the tournament winner was the Brooklyn/New Jersey Nets. The Katie Kirlin Fund was established by Joe and Roseann Kirlin, of South Philadelphia, to keep alive the memory of their daughter, Katie, who loved wheelchair sports and died of cancer in 1989 at the age of 12. The charity makes donations for Katie's Komets sports wheelchairs (approximately $2,000 to $2,500, each) and for tournament travel to New York, New Jersey, Virginia and Kentucky. Joe Kirlin said he wishes more kids with disabilities would discover the sport. "I've heard there's something like 2,500 kids with disabilities in the area who could be playing wheelchair basketball," he said. "We have 35 kids in [the two divisions of] Katie's Komets. Where's the other 2,400? I'd like to get the word out that there's money here for this and that a lot of our kids go to college." Komets assistant coach Shawn Devault, of Easton, played for eight years with the team, went on to earn a bachelor's degree in adaptive recreation at, and play for, the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater, where the wheelchair basketball team won national championships in 2012 and 2013. "When you're a kid with a disability, you grow up in circumstances where you're the kid who sticks out, you're the kid that's different," Devault said. "It's not like you go to a community center or a Walmart and see a person who looks like you. So wheelchair basketball is a chance to be with people who experience what you experience." Komets head coach Keith Newerla, of Valley Forge, a lifelong wheelchair user, said, "Some of our kids are mainstreamed, so they may be the only kid with a disability in school. Here, they have a chance to become friends with people who are in a similar situation and understand what you're going through." Newerla said he's seen Katie's Komets players become more independent as they spend more time around their peers. "Rather than ask their mom to help with something, they may ask a teammate or do it themselves. If a kid wants to meet up with his friends, and his dad's not moving fast enough, he may put his own shoes on so he can go be with the rest of the kids. It's about more than basketball. We spend time in practice on how to take care of your chair." Aaron Cox, 17, from South Philadelphia, said playing for Katie's Komets was all about the chemistry with his teammates and living his lifelong basketball dream, fueled by years of watching NBA games. His dad, Paul Cox, said Aaron "understands the game technically. He's got a coaching mind. He can tell who played on what NBA team in what year, and what his statistics were. I can't remember which day the trash goes out." Cox laughed, then grew serious. "This is his thing," Cox said, watching his basketball-loving son. "This is what he lives for." geringd@phillynews.com 267-443-3540 @DanGeringer More Coverage After a bullet to the spine and viral video, he became Upper Body Boy Jan 19 - 3:16 PM Published: January 22, 2017 — 7:15 PM EST | Updated: January 23, 2017 — 1:07 AM EST The Philadelphia Inquirer We encourage respectful comments but reserve the right to delete anything that doesn't contribute to an engaging dialogue Help us moderate this thread by flagging comments that violate our guidelines Commenting policy | Comments FAQ Comment policy: Philly.com comments are intended to be civil, friendly conversations.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Monday, 23 January 2017 Beyond grotesquely wealthy by yap leng kuen - plain speaking Mega rich: Oxfam says it is ‘beyond grotesque’ that a handful of rich men headed by Microsoft founder Bill Gates are worth US426bil, equivalent to the wealth of 3.6 billion of the world population. — Reuters Eight billionaires have as much wealth as half of the world’s population THAT the world’s top eight billionaires own the same wealth between them as the poorest half of the population, an Oxfam survey reveals, is startling. Not only does it indicate the immense concentration of wealth and power, but it may point to a long term potential decline in consumption among those with considerably less wealth. The development charity said it was ‘beyond grotesque’ that a handful of rich men headed by Microsoft founder Bill Gates were worth US$426bil, equivalent to the wealth of 3.6 billion of the world population. There is a need for a new economic model to reverse an inequality trend that purportedly helped to explain Brexit and Donald Trump’s victory in the US presidential election, said Bloomberg, quoting Oxfam. “This clearly shows how capitalism widens the wealth gap between the rich and the poor, manifested in the form of wealth concentration and growing income inequality. The complaint is that warnings of dire consequences have fallen on deaf ears. “Such rising inequality, if it persists, will destabilize the social fabric of society as well as lead to greater polarization and division. “This raises deep worries that the super-rich plutocrats will wield power and influence by virtue of their massive wealth accumulation,’’ said Lee Heng Guie, executive director, Socio Economic Research Center. Free market forces have come into question. “Some have questioned if the ultra-free market and globalised capitalism has fully exploited the less developed countries and only benefited the developed and wealthier nations, which give them more power and influence as well as enhanced wealth,’’ said Lee. This top billionaire group is headed by Gates, Amancio Ortega, founder of the Spanish fashion chain Zara, and Warren Buffett, renowned investor and chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway. The others are Carlos Slim Helú, the Mexican telecoms tycoon and owner of conglomerate Grupo Carso; Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon; Mark Zuckerberg, founder of Facebook; Larry Ellison, chief executive of Oracle and Michael Bloomberg, a former mayor of New York and founder and owner of the Bloomberg news and financial information service, according to Bloomberg. In contrast, Oxfam said last year the world’s 62 richest billionaires were as wealthy as half of the population. However, Bloomberg said the number has dropped to eight in 2017 because new information shows that poverty in China and India is worse than previously thought, making the bottom 50% even worse off. Poor distribution of wealth may have lasting effects on overall consumption. “The kind of civil unrest like the Occupy Wall Street movement arose because of poor distribution of wealth. “We also have certain segments and industries catering to a broader mass market that are suffering, for instance, Walmart is retrenching. “I suspect consumption will overall slump for economies worldwide eventually if this spreads. “There is a point made in economics that the propensity to consume out of income is higher for those who are poorer than the rich,’’ said Pong Teng Siew, head of research, Inter-Pacific Securities. US stocks rose for the first time in 50 years when a new president was sworn in. Does this point to anything? The Trump rally in stocks since the surprise US election outcome had stalled recently as investors awaited clarity on how Trump would boost the economy. Meanwhile, the strength of the US dollar seems to have wavered slightly following comments from Trump that it was too strong, noted Hor Kwok Wai, chief operating officer, global markets, Hong Leong Bank. With the recent string of improved economic data, the most likely outcome is higher short term US interest rates, said Hor, who added that while there is a lot to look out for, one has to wait for details before taking further views on the markets. The buoyant mood on US stockmarket is based on expectation and is infectious. “It is symptomatic of the great sense of anticipation and hope with which the US is looking to the Trump administration, and there is much hope that he will be the next Ronald Reagan. “With interest rates at an all time low, unlike the 20% rates and much lower prevailing debt levels at the time Reagan stepped into office, such high hopes may very well end in disappointment. “But Trump is ebullient and projects such confidence that the mood is infectious,’’ said Pong. Reagan was US president from 1981-89; his Reaganomics focused on lowering taxes, government spending and regulation which resulted in an economic expansion that brought the country out of the worst recession since the Great Depression. Reaganomics had brought about one of the longest economic expansions in US history although some argued it was interest rate cuts that had stimulated the economy; the Fed funds rate was lowered from 6% at the beginning of 2001 to 1% in June 2003. Government spending was shifted from domestic programmes to defence, and Federal debt nearly tripled from US$997bil in 1981 to US$2.857 trillion in 1989. Trump’s conviction is driving the current positive mood. “His powerful inaugural speech underscores his strong conviction to deliver his election promises; Trumpnomics, reflation and the strong US dollar will define the year,’’ said Lee. Columnist Yap Leng Kuen prays for hopes to materialise.

Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Jan 22, 2017 at 5:54PM The S&P 500 has risen less than 1% since the beginning of the year, but plenty of stocks posted double-digit gains during that time. Let's take a closer look at three stocks that have rallied about 20% in January -- Shopify (NYSE:SHOP), Box (NYSE:BOX), and Workday (NYSE:WDAY) -- and see if they can continue rising through the rest of the year. Image source: Getty Images. Shopify Shopify provides a cloud-based e-commerce platform for small to medium-sized businesses. Its software enables companies to design, set up, and run their own online stores, and lets them accept credit cards, view incoming orders, and review completed transactions. Shopify's 18% rally in January is a continuation of its 150% rally over the past 12 months. That rally can be attributed to its impressive top-line growth -- its revenue surged 89% annually, to $99.6 million last quarter, following four straight quarters of 90%+ growth. Shopify served over 325,000 merchants at the end of last quarter, which was a big jump from its customer base of "over 200,000" merchants in the prior-year quarter, and its gross merchandise volume doubled to $3.8 million. It also announced deeper integration with Amazon's sales channel earlier this month, making it easier for its customers to sell products on the e-commerce giant's marketplace. Analysts expect Shopify's revenue to rise 86% for the full year, but it still isn't profitable yet on a GAAP or non-GAAP basis. Its GAAP loss widened last quarter, mainly due to higher stock-based compensation expenses, but its non-GAAP loss slightly narrowed. Shopify is a pretty pricey stock at 13 times sales, but its growth trajectory might support that valuation. Box Box provides online file sharing and personal cloud content for businesses. The company faces tough challenges in the cloud-storage market from Dropbox and bigger tech giants, but its customer base already includes massive companies like General Electric and Symantec. Like Shopify, Box has great top-line growth and weak bottom-line growth. Its revenue rose 31% annually, to $102.8 million last quarter, as billings rose 26%. Deferred revenue, a key indicator of future demand, jumped 36%, to $192.6 million. Box's quarterly revenues have now risen by more than 30% annually for the past five quarters, and analysts anticipate 31% sales growth this year. Box is unprofitable by both GAAP and non-GAAP metrics, but its losses are narrowing by both measures. Image source: Getty Images. Box has rallied 23% in January, but still trades at six times sales, which is only slightly higher than the industry average of four for application-software companies. But looking ahead, Box and Dropbox both face very tough competition in the cloud-storage market. Companies like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) are offering plenty of free and cheap storage to enterprise customers to tether them to their cloud ecosystems. Despite that competition, Microsoft has integrated Box into Office 365, sparking rumors of an eventual takeover. With an enterprise value of just over $2 billion, Box could certainly be a lucrative target in a consolidation of the cloud-storage market. Workday Workday provides enterprise cloud applications that help companies staff, pay, and organize their workforces. They also utilize analytics and machine learning to help companies make financial and workforce-related decisions. Demand for these services has been robust -- Workday's sales rose 34% annually last quarter and have risen 30% to 40% over the past four quarters. Analysts expect its revenue to rise 35% this year, although the company warned in early January that a few of its bigger deals had been delayed by global uncertainties regarding Brexit, the U.S. presidential election, and other G8 country elections. But like Shopify and Box, Workday has weak profitability. That's because the cost of securing new customers coupled with price competition and the low margins of the cloud SaaS (software as a service) market make it tough to squeeze out a profit, even with double-digit sales growth. Workday squeezed out a narrow non-GAAP profit last quarter, but its GAAP earnings remain deep in the red. Its price-to-sales ratio of 11 also looks pricey relative to its software-industry peers. However, Workday stock recently rallied after Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) subscribed to its Human Capital Management, Recruiting, Learning, and Planning products. That deal might add $100 million to $200 million to Workday's annual revenues (5%-10% of its projected revenues for next year), according to Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White -- but Wal-Mart didn't disclose how many of its 2 million+ employees would actually use the system. Nonetheless, that rally lifted Workday stock 24% in January. Should you buy these stocks? Shopify, Box, and Workday are all fairly high-risk growth stocks. I believe that Box's lower valuation and buyout potential make it the "safest" stock on this list, while Shopify's incredible top-line growth makes it the best growth play. Workday is also a good growth play, but its weak profitability and high valuations make it a risky bet for a frothy market.   Teresa Kersten is an employee of LinkedIn and is a member of The Motley Fool's Board of Directors.

Trump’s spokesman Sean Spicer told a news conference on Saturday that the two leaders will meet on January 31, the week after senior officials of both administrations hold bilateral talks in Washington. Trump is committed to renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) and would move to withdraw if no “fair deal” is forthcoming, according to the White House website. Pena Nieto, whose popularity has plummeted due to corruption scandals and rising inflation, has been criticized for lacking a clear strategy to counter Trump’s threats to crimp trade and deport illegal immigrants. Seeking to capitalize on that discontent, Mexican 2018 presidential forerunner Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on Saturday said he would tour major US cities starting in February. “Enough of being passive,” Lopez Obrador of the leftist Moreno party said in a statement. “We should put a national emergency plan in place to face the damage and reverse the protectionist policies of Donald Trump.” Lopez Obrador, a former Mexico City mayor mounting his third presidential bid, said at a rally in the border city of Ciudad Acuna that he would “stop the hate promoted by propaganda against migrants”. Many in Mexico are worried about another Trump promise, that he will make Mexico pay for a border wall, possibly by blocking wire transfers out of the United States from Mexican nationals. “We shouldn’t pay for the wall,” said Christina Validez, waiting to pick up a wire transfer from her husband in the United States at a bank in Ixmiquilpan. “It’s the other way around, all United States presidents should be grateful that all the migrants have helped the economy.” The area around Ixmiquilpan, in the central state of Hidalgo and home to some 94,000 people, received about US$100 million (RM443.65 million) in foreign remittances in 2015, according to data from Mexico’s central bank, more than 10 times the municipal government’s annual budget. Validez said she depends on the money sent back to make ends meet and she complained about “everything” becoming more expensive after the government hiked regular gasoline prices by 14 per cent at the start of the year. Looting and violent protests followed the gasoline hike around the country. Two people died in Ixmiquilpan in clashes with state and federal police after protesters blockaded a highway and burnt vehicles. On Saturday, Mexicans, many with relatives in the United States, queued for hours outside a bank located in an appliance store in Ixmiquilpan’s town center. The store had cut back hours, opening only briefly, to process wire transfers and payments after protesters angry about the gasoline hike forced the closure of stores owned by big corporations, demanding support of local businesses. Stores in the town owned by Wal-Mart and convenience store operator Femsa were forced to close and were still shuttered two weeks later. On Friday, people gathered outside a Ford Motor Co showroom in the capital to protest the company’s cancellation of a US$1.6 billion investment in an auto plant in Mexico after months of pressure from Trump. During his US tour, Lopez Obrador, who finished second to Pena Nieto in the 2012 presidential vote, plans to meet people of Mexican origin living in major cities, starting February 12 in Los Angeles, then to Chicago, Phoenix and others. Pena Nieto said earlier on Saturday that he highlighted the importance of the US-Mexico relationship on a call with Trump. “We don’t know if the government is defending us, if it’s with us or not,” said Margarita Escamilla, a legal resident in the United States from Ixmiquilpan visiting family. Lopez Obrador “is like all of them, saying he’s going to defend migrants but who knows ... they promise and promise and it stays the same,” she said.  — Reuters                  MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Trump vows ‘new vetting’ to weed out Islamic radicals Nobel Peace winner Malala ‘heartbroken’ by Trump order US anti-abortion camp rallies in DC with Trump’s backing By picking fight with Mexico, Trump shocks key partner Lindsay Lohan meets Erdogan, Syrian girl blogger Trump on protesters: Why didn't these people vote?

Grogan | CNBC Davos, Switzerland gets ready to host the World Economic Forum this week. When the chief executive of Saudi Arabia's national oil and gas company mapped out a glowing future for fossil fuels at a discussion in Davos this past week, dissent came from an unexpected corner of the room. "We have to make a big push in renewables investment," urged Qiao Baoping, chairman of the energy giant China Guodian. "We have commitments under the Paris accord which we cannot fail to fulfill," he said, referring to the climate deal passed in 2015. Under the Obama administration, the United States took on a climate leadership role. But President Trump has threatened to quit the Paris climate deal, and within minutes of his taking office on Friday, the White House website removed a discussion of the threat of climate change and replaced it with a commitment to eliminate cornerstone environmental policies. If the United States is willing to cede its role, however, there are plenty of countries happy to step up. More from the New York Times: Davos Elite Fret About Inequality Over Vintage Wine andCanapés In Davos, Bracing for a Shifting U.S. Stance on Climate Change How Davos Brings the Global Elite Together Over four days of intense politicking and parleying at the World Economic Forum in Davos, the annual gathering in the Swiss Alps where global policy and business leaders debate the world's challenges, the sizable Chinese delegation seemed to preach climate action every chance it got. President Xi Jinping of China set the tone by opening the forum on Tuesday, arguing forcefully for follow-through on the 2015 Paris climate deal. His message was clearly relayed through the Chinese ranks: ■ Mr. Qiao boasted that 70 percent of the 100 billion renminbi, or $14.6 billion, that China Guodian paid into new investments last year went to renewables like wind and solar. ■ Yu Xubo, president of the Chinese food and agriculture giant Cofco, stunned environmental groups by announcing that the company would eliminate deforestation from its supply chain. "Continue business as usual," he warned, "and face big, serious risks." ■ Nur Bekri, China's energy minister, was blunt in acknowledging not only climate change but also the human contribution to it — a declaration unlikely to be heard by certain members of Mr. Trump's administration. "Today, we are facing climate change, and we know this is caused by our use of energy," Mr. Bekri declared. "That is why the Chinese government attaches great importance to the development of clean energy." Other developing nations, including India, also promoted their environmental records. Nirmala Sitharaman, the Indian minister of state for commerce and industry, said the country was ready for a bigger global role in mitigating climate change. She pointed to the International Solar Alliance, a coalition of more than 120 countries that seeks $1 trillion in investments to ramp up solar energy generation. The alliance was first proposed by the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi. India, Ms. Sitharaman said, is "no longer on the fringe" of climate change policies and technologies. The lure of a potentially huge market for clean energy and other technologies that would help mitigate climate change was a driving force, analysts said. The International Energy Agency estimates that renewables will remain the fastest-growing source of electricity into 2021, reaching nearly 30 percent of all power generation by then. They are also motivated by the risks posed by rising seas, extreme weather and other consequences of unmitigated climate change. Even if the world is able to stave off an increase in atmospheric temperatures of 2 degrees Celsius or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit — a goal agreed to as part of the Paris deal — climate change could wipe out $1.7 trillion worth of global financial assets, according to a peer-reviewed study published last year in the journal Nature. For example, coastal properties could be lost to rising sea levels. "Countries are competing to succeed in this new space," said Pete Ogden, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress who was a climate adviser to former President Barack Obama. "At the same time, Mr. Trump is signaling a kind of fearfulness of America's capacity to succeed in a clean economy." "They see it in their economic self-interest to do so," Mr. Ogden said, referring to other countries. "And if the United States wants to cede the playing field, they'll be happy to capture as big of a share as they possibly can." Many corporations, even some previously vilified for their environmental footprint, were eager to jump on the bandwagon, promoting climate-friendly business practices. Doug McMillon, the chief executive of Walmart, praised a $3.88 T-shirt made of cotton that he said was traceable to the Mississippi Valley. It was made, he said, with 50 percent renewable energy and reused water. A group of 62 chief executives at Davos discussed, among other issues, spurring Mr. Trump to take climate action by emphasizing how clean energy investment can create jobs, said Paul Polman, chief executive of Unilever, who participated in the event. "To make America great again, climate action is very logical," he said. "This is a very convincing story for job creation and economic growth." But there are concerns over this new class of climate-change stewards. Despite its talk of being a leader in fighting global warming, China, the world's biggest polluter, has refused to accept international monitoring of its emissions, and conflicting data about the country's energy use has raised questions about the accuracy of its reporting. It still depends on coal for three-quarters of its electricity, though its recent announcement that it would cancel plans to build more than 100 coal-fired plants has raised hopes that the country is finally serious about weaning itself off thermal power. Corporations have repeatedly proved themselves less than perfect guardians of the environment. A study by researchers at George Washington University and the University of Michigan showed that, under a voluntary program to disclose greenhouse gas emissions, companies that emitted more tended to report the opposite. Rachel Kyte, special representative of Sustainable Energy for All, a United Nations-backed group that promotes clean energy, said there had been a major shift in the attitudes of top companies toward climate-change risks in recent years. Ms. Kyte, who led the discussion at the Davos meeting of chief executives, said the prospect of more investor or regulatory scrutiny of the risks from climate change that companies face had galvanized action. "It was a roll-up-your-sleeves kind of session," she said. "The sense was that we need to keep moving action forward, because we don't have time."

From left, area campaign captains Alfie Read and Ann Bickerton, and tele-recruiter Marc Joanette show off their campaign materials that feature the foundation’s new bold logo. next play/pause pre St. Lawrence News By Monica Mroz The Heart and Stroke Foundation volunteers who are now canvassing for donations locally are among the most enthusiastic and willing in the province. There are 1,884 residents from this service area, which covers the counties of Leeds and Grenville, Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry, and Prescott-Russell, who will knock on doors, make phone calls and send emails to raise $225,000 toward the national campaign that runs until mid-March. That makes this local Heart and Stroke office one of only two in Ontario to have surpassed its goal for number of canvassers, sharing the title with Thunder Bay. Many of those canvassers gathered at the Gananoque Royal Canadian Legion on Wednesday, Jan. 18 to hear an upbeat presentation and get pumped up about the Heart Month campaign. Similar rallies were also held in Brockville and Kemptville. “It’s a phenomenal community,” said Heart and Stroke area manager Lynn Kenney, commenting on the support of local volunteers. “When we did recruitment in Leeds-Grenville, it was amazing. People are rushing to help.” Canvassers will be easily recognizable with materials that feature the foundation’s new bold and simplified logo: a white heart and slanted stroke symbol on a red background. The updated brand replaces the former heart logo with a maple leaf and flame. Money raised locally from the campaign stays within the service area through the placement of defibrillators in public areas, such as schools, arenas, malls and libraries. In this region last year, the “54 hearts that failed were all saved” because of defibrillators, noted Foundation area co-ordinator Ashley Manwell at the heart rally. The Heart and Stroke Foundation is also looking at increased donations from online canvassing. Last year saw a nine-per-cent growth in donations; organizers are hoping for a 17-per-cent increase in this year’s campaign. “It is starting to flourish. We see that trending,” Kenney said of the online canvassing that complements traditional door-to-door campaigning. Canvassers at the rally heard about the foundation’s online risk assessment that provides a free personalized health report and coaching. Kenney stressed the importance of knowing your body and symptoms of heart disease. “We would line up for hours for a free TV at Walmart. Why wouldn’t you take the time to get checked out?” It’s worth it. It’s free, so let’s use that,” she added. While referring to the volunteers as ambassadors of the Heart and Stroke Foundation in the community, Manwell said they “work hard at diminishing statistics that kills a Canadian every seven minutes." In expressing her thanks, Manwell said, “You certainly are making a difference. Every dollar raised brings families home.” The national campaign target is $10 million.

Chairman Emeritus Dick Anderson said The Andersons tried many strategies to save its four stores, two in the area and two in Columbus. It was, he said, ‘pretty darn discouraging.’ THE BLADE Buy This Image The Andersons’ online retail presence was limited. Holiday shoppers spent $123 billion online out of a $658 billion total. ASSOCIATED PRESS The Andersons was a ‘unique animal among retailers,’ said consultant Chris Boring. It ‘always was a throwback to the old days.’ THE BLADE/DAVE ZAPOTOSKY Buy This Image Share Tweet Share Email Comments Print With his brow furrowed and head tilted slightly, Mike Anderson thought for a few moments, then decided he very much liked the description he had just heard. The Andersons Inc.’s retail stores had been “nibbled to death” over the last decade, the company chairman agreed. The first nibble was by a wave of new competitors picking off his stores biggest-selling categories, and the last one was by the company’s customers wholeheartedly embracing online shopping. “Nibbled to death is an interesting phrase because it has been somewhat of an attrition process — a little bit here and a little bit there,” Mr. Anderson said last Sunday just hours after the Monclova Township-based diversified agribusiness announced it will exit retail after 65 years by closing its four general stores and eliminate 1,050 jobs.  RELATED CONTENT: Andersons rode wave of retail trends The Andersons was a ‘unique animal among retailers,’ said consultant Chris Boring. It ‘always was a throwback to the old days.’ THE BLADE/DAVE ZAPOTOSKY Enlarge | Buy This Image “That’s fundamentally the issue, not how does [retail] fit with the rest of our business,” Mr. Anderson said The closings, to occur this spring for a Toledo and Maumee general store and two stores in Columbus, is another example of the tough straits of retailers. Not only do they compete against each other, but online shopping, apps, and other digital products have cut into the brick-and-mortar store business that lead to shuttered buildings. In the past few weeks, Macy’s said it would close 15 percent of its stores, Sears Holdings is closing 78 Kmart stores and 26 Sears stores by spring, The Limited has closed all 250 of its stores, CVS will close 70 stores this year, and JCPenney’s chief executive said it will announce store closings soon. The Andersons retail division, which began in 1952 and which lost $20 million over eight years, was a small piece of the local $4.2 billion agribusiness, which thrives on its grain, ethanol, railcar, and plant nutrient operations. The stores carry a wide range of goods, from food to furniture to lawn mowers to tools to clothing. Pat Bowe, The Andersons chief executive, said of its stores, “We’ve been hoping we could get a turnaround but ... we just didn’t see a path to get that turned around for us.” Pat Huddleston, a professor of retailing at Michigan State University, said The Andersons carries a breadth of merchandise not unlike Meijer. But, “With only four stores, it’s definitely hard for them to get economy of scale deals from vendors. And that’s just one strike against them,” she said. “Another is, food tends to be a low-margin business. You’re talking 2 to 3 percent margins. Then, because they’re small but carry such a breadth of merchandise, that’s a third strike against them in the current [retail] environment,” she said. The current environment, Ms. Huddleston said, has online shopping putting bricks-and-mortar retailers in retreat. “If The Andersons haven’t been profitable for eight years, then that is an indicator that they didn’t make the strategic decisions necessary to survive,” she said. But Chairman Emeritus Dick Anderson said the company tried multiple strategies through the years to bolster its stores. None worked. “Every time we’d spend a million on an upgrade, the customer count and average sale would slip,” he said. “Pretty darn discouraging.” Kelli Hollinger, director of the Center for Retailing Studies at Texas A&M University, said small general merchandisers such as The Andersons have faced a growing disadvantage for some time now against retail behemoths like Wal-Mart and Target.  And now Amazon.com is the biggest threat yet. “Without differentiated merchandise, a general merchandise chain can be lost against online retailers that simply offer more selection with the convenience of cheap, quick delivery,” she said. Chris Boring, a Columbus retail consultant, said The Andersons’ two stores in Ohio’s capital “had a cult following in Columbus,” he said, adding that wealthy suburbanites loved going there for wine, gourmet foods, and garden supplies. “Their merchandise mix really doesn’t seem to have any rhyme or reason — but the suburbanites liked that,” the consultant said. But The Andersons had a limited online retail presence, Mr. Boring said. And that comes as online shopping grew by 13 percent in 2016 while all retail sales grew just 4 percent. For the recent holiday shopping season nationally, $658 billion was spent and $123 billion of that was spent online. The Andersons’ online retail presence was limited. Holiday shoppers spent $123 billion online out of a $658 billion total. ASSOCIATED PRESS Enlarge Some consumers and employees have suggested the company should retreat to a single store again as it began in 1952. But Mr. Boring said that’s an impossible task because resources — credit-card charges, point-of-sale systems, security, inventory, stocking, and more — are more expensive with one store than with four, making it financially unfeasible. “One store would absorb all the costs, that is, the overhead of four stores. If it’s not profitable with four stores, there’s no way it could be profitable with one store,” Mr. Boring said. “It probably seems counter-intuitive to the average person who shops there, but that’s the way retail is.” Dick Anderson said the stores were problematic for a decade but the company was reluctant to close them even knowing it likely couldn’t compete with Lowe’s, Home Depot, Wal-Mart, and others.  “Those guys had us before we opened the door,” he said. “All we were looking for at the end of the day was like 2 percent [profit margin], which just wasn’t there.”  “Then it became, ‘Wow, this is a community service; we’ve got all these jobs to protect.’ And we struggled with that for the last 10 years or so and being a public [stock] company, the pressure began to build more and more and we’d get sharp questions [from Wall Street investors] about when are we going to deal with that?” he said. Mr. Boring said The Andersons “are a unique animal among retailers ... but always was a throwback to the old days,” he said.  “I’m kind of surprised they didn’t close them earlier,” he added.

At a time when most banks are seeing a lot of stressed assets, the situation is not too bad for South Indian Bank. The bank reported gross non performing assets of 3.96 for the quarter ending Sept 30, 2016. This is not as bad as it seems. In fact, the non performing assets were flat, when compared to the previous quarter which is good news. The bank has a small equity capital of Rs 135 crores. Valuations of South Indian Bank The bank reported an EPS of 0.82 for the quarter ending Sept 2016. It is highly possible if the economic situation improves in the next few quarters, the bank can report an EPS of Rs 3.5 for the full year. This means the stocks is available at a price to earnings ratio of just about 6 times. The stock is highly undervalued at the current levels. The stock also gives a good dividend yield of around 2.38 per cent. The shares are a good buy at the current levels. Check stock quote here Sintex Industries This is another stock under Rs 100, that could be a worthy fit in most portfolios. Sintex is one of the largest producers of plastic water tankers in the world with a solid brand equity. However, today the company is well diversified into a host of products. Among these include prefab for construction and housing, a textile division, which is also showing very high growth. Not very expensive Shares of Sintex are not too expensive at the current levels. In fact, the company had an exceptional performance for the quarter ending Sept 30, 2016, wherein it reported very good earnings. The EPS for the period was a solid Rs 3.58. If the company keeps up the same momentum it can report an EPS of Rs 14 for the full year. The stock at Rs 84, is trading at a p/e of just 6 times. The stock is also trading below its book value of Rs 99. This makes it an excellent pick at the current levels . Welspun India Until recently, the stock of Welspun India was consistently trading above Rs 100, however, after reports that Target Corporation had severed ties with the company for substituting cheaper cotton variety instead of Egyptian cotton in bedsheets, the stock dropped sharply from levels of Rs 107, the stock is now below Rs 100, which makes it an attractive buy. The company is one of the largest manufacturers of terry towels and is Ranked 1st among Home Textile Suppliers in the US. it supplies to every top manufacturers from Walmart to J C Penney. Fundamentals Fundamentally the stock is pretty reasonably valued at the current levels. We believe that despite the loss of order from Target Corporation it can still report an EPS of Rs 6 for 2017-18. Hence, at the current market price of Rs 84, it is not a bad bet. Federal Bank This is another bank like South Indian Bank that may not really be a bad bet, if one is ready to have some patience. The stock is likely to boast a decent set of results in the coming quarters. For example, the stock is available at a price to earnings multiple, which is not very expensive. We believe that for 2016-17, the bank can report an EPS of Rs 10 on a very conservative estimates. At the current price of Rs 68, the stock is trading at a p/e of just about 7 times, one year forwards earnings. The stock can be bought if one has a long term perspective in mind. Economic recovery may push the stock to greater heights in the coming days. Disclaimer The article is not a solicitation to buy, sell in securities or other financial instruments.

Trump's spokesman Sean Spicer told a news conference on Saturday that the two leaders will meet on Jan. 31, the week after senior officials of both administrations hold bilateral talks in Washington. Trump is committed to renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and would move to withdraw if no "fair deal" is forthcoming, according to the White House website. Try Newsweek for only $1.25 per week Pena Nieto, whose popularity has plummeted due to corruption scandals and rising inflation, has been criticized for lacking a clear strategy to counter Trump's threats to crimp trade and deport illegal immigrants. Seeking to capitalize on that discontent, Mexican 2018 presidential forerunner Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on Saturday said he would tour major U.S. cities starting in February. "Enough of being passive," Lopez Obrador of the leftist Moreno party said in a statement. "We should put a national emergency plan in place to face the damage and reverse the protectionist policies of Donald Trump." Lopez Obrador, a former Mexico City mayor mounting his third presidential bid, said at a rally in the border city of Ciudad Acuna that he would "stop the hate promoted by propaganda against migrants." Many in Mexico are worried about another Trump promise, that he will make Mexico pay for a border wall, possibly by blocking wire transfers out of the United States from Mexican nationals. Mexico's President Enrique Pena Nieto speaks to the audience during a meeting with members of the Diplomatic Corps in Mexico City, Mexico, January 11. Carlos Jasso/Reuters "We shouldn't pay for the wall," said Christina Validez, waiting to pick up a wire transfer from her husband in the United States at a bank in Ixmiquilpan. "It's the other way around, all United States presidents should be grateful that all the migrants have helped the economy." The area around Ixmiquilpan, in the central state of Hidalgo and home to some 94,000 people, received about $100 million in foreign remittances in 2015, according to data from Mexico's central bank, more than 10 times the municipal government's annual budget. Validez said she depends on the money sent back to make ends meet and she complained about "everything" becoming more expensive after the government hiked regular gasoline prices by 14 percent at the start of the year. Looting and violent protests followed the gasoline hike around the country. Two people died in Ixmiquilpan in clashes with state and federal police after protesters blockaded a highway and burnt vehicles. On Saturday, Mexicans, many with relatives in the United States, queued for hours outside a bank located in an appliance store in Ixmiquilpan's town center. The store had cut back hours, opening only briefly, to process wire transfers and payments after protesters angry about the gasoline hike forced the closure of stores owned by big corporations, demanding support of local businesses. Stores in the town owned by Wal-Mart and convenience store operator Femsa were forced to close and were still shuttered two weeks later. On Friday, people gathered outside a Ford Motor Co. showroom in the capital to protest the company's cancellation of a $1.6 billion investment in an auto plant in Mexico after months of pressure from Trump.

Pena Nieto said earlier on Saturday that he highlighted the importance of the U.S.-Mexico relationship on a call with Trump. "We don't know if the government is defending us, if it's with us or not," said Margarita Escamilla, a legal resident in the United States from Ixmiquilpan visiting family. Lopez Obrador "is like all of them, saying he's going to defend migrants but who knows ... they promise and promise and it stays the same," she said.

Growth dominates Central Florida's immediate economic vision, while local leaders wait for the impact of President Trump's policies. Kyle ArnoldContact ReporterOrlando Sentinel Central Florida retail needs "more inspiration" to beat online, experts say It's called destination shopping, and many of the new stores seeking success in Metro Orlando during 2017 hope to take more advantage of locations near popular attractions. Some of the area's fastest growing retail corridors are centered around new experiences and attractions, such as the northern end of International Drive near Universal Studios or the tourism core farther south near Orange County Convention Center. New attractions are also coming to that area to boost traffic, such as Mario Andretti's Racing Experience and Topgolf coming in summer. "People are more likely to be out shopping and eating if they are near an attraction of some kind," said retail real estate broker Bobby Palta, who works for CBRE. "It's about experiences now for shoppers." County and business leaders have been working on a plan to spur more retail and entertainment development in the booming tourist corridors. New projects in the works would add hundreds of thousands of square feet of retail next to attractions such as Topgolf and the racing complex. Some would even pair attractions with hotel and retail, such as the planned SkyPlex project slated for the world's largest Perkins restaurant and topped with a roller coaster on land that borders Sand Lake Road. In between, there's still room for growth or redevelopment around I-Drive 360, a shopping and dining complex that's home to Orlando Eye.

It's about 60 miles from Orlando's city limits.. Meanwhile, a new overpass headed to North International Drive in 2017 is creating interest in areas around Orlando International Premium Outlets mall. Nearby Artegon Marketplace is set to close soon, leaving nearly 100 acres open for redevelopment. Real estate brokers said the future of that property will likely include restaurants, lodging and retail. But it is unlikely to stay a mall after two failed attempts, said International Drive property developer Joshua Wallack. "It's one of the most interesting pieces of property in the area," Wallack. "Someone is going to have to go in there with a vision." Some new stores are trying to offer more hands-on experiences for customers. One store hoping to capture the attention of shoppers is the new REI store headed to Winter Park. The new 25,000-square-foot store is expected to open in May as the retailer's second location in the state. REI focuses on outdoor gear and apparel for activities such as hiking and camping. Most of it is high-end gear, distinctive from merchandise at sporting goods retailers such as Dick's or Academy. REI stores are famous for interactive features such as rock-climbing walls along with exhibits of its high-end camping and cycling equipment. Other stores are looking to take old concepts, such as home improvement, and give it a new twist. Orchard Supply Hardware is working to debut in Central Florida with three new stores, one on Turkey Lake Road, one at Orlando Fashion Square and a third in southern Winter Park. A subsidiary of Lowe's, Orchard Supply's stores are smaller and are aimed at D-I-Y homeowners. "We'll have people there to help out with small projects," said Orchard Supply district manager David Rosa. The first on Turkey Lake Road is scheduled to open in the first quarter. Opening dates for the others are not scheduled yet. Other new retail additions in 2017 include a new Nordstrom Rack store in Winter Park. The retailer has a store near Mall at Millenia and is building a 25,000-square-foot space at Winter Park Square. That's the same shopping center that recently opened a new Whole Foods Market. When that's not an option, retailers such as Wal-Mart are adapting to on-demand delivery competitors such as Amazon with drive-through grocery pick-up. That comes as delivery services continue to ramp up offerings. Wal-Mart recently opened two new area stores with mobile grocery pick-up lanes in the Lake Nona and south Winter Garden areas. It has also converted four existing stores. With this program, customers order online with a computer or on a mobile app. At an appointed pick-up time, the groceries are then delivered to the customers car. Most new Wal-Mart stores are being designed with the feature; the company has seven Central Florida stores that offer the option. Retail analyst Marshal Cohen said in-store pick-up and same-day delivery are a few signs that customers are starting to put higher value on convenience. Those are some of the problems faced by retailers that have been closing or cutting in the area, such as Sports Authority, The Limited and Sears. "2017 is going to be a year of transition for retail," said Marshal Cohen, a retail industry analyst for research group NPD. "There are very few things that people won't purchase on the internet; even mattresses have moved online." Cohen said that to survive, retailers will have to offer unique experiences. "The best stores are going to find a way to inspire shoppers," Cohen said. "If you have a product that can be purchased anywhere, you either have to be the cheapest or easiest." karnold@orlandosentinel.com or 407-420-5664; Twitter, @kylelarnold Privacy Policy Copyright © 2017, Orlando Sentinel Recreational Equipment Inc.

But it’s something we tend to take for granted until things go wrong — heavy traffic, air travel delays or roadway collapses. And because we’ve failed to invest in keeping our system robust, those events happen more and more often. Meanwhile, transportation is undergoing major shifts — with new technologies and upgraded methods. Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Edward Humes looked at this unique world in his book Door to Door: The Magnificent, Maddening, Mysterious World of Transportation. He joined the Knowledge@Wharton Show on Sirius XM channel 111 to talk about where it is all heading. An edited transcript of the conversation appears below. Knowledge@Wharton: Where did the idea for this book come from? Edward Humes: I think I was just dreading being on the highway. I started looking into what it takes to keep my own family and household going, and it really isn’t just the commute that we all dread —  that’s the least of it. There are millions of miles embedded in our daily lives. The cup of coffee I’m holding in my hand right now took 30,000 miles to reach me, and that’s just for the beans, not the cup or the water or the filter or any of the other parts of the coffee-drinking process. If you look at anything in your home, you’re going to see a footprint that big, or even bigger. Knowledge@Wharton: This is a book that’s not just about our highways and our railroad systems; this is about, in some respects, the business of transportation on a variety of different fronts. Humes: It is. It’s the business side, and it’s the human side of it. There’s a cast of thousands behind that cup of coffee as well — the people at the port, the truckers who pick it up at the port, people who maintain the highway that the truckers drive on, and the drivers on that highway that are financing that roadbed, and on and on. It’s a chain of interconnectivity that really is reaching a crossroads because, in some ways, we can’t afford to maintain what we have, and yet the technology is evolving, changing, growing and making more demands on what we have. Knowledge@Wharton: You bring up an interesting point. The technology is developing, yet there are so many issues in the transportation end of it, the construction end of it, the supply chain end of everything. This has almost become — even though the government has kind of pushed it off in some respects — a 24/7 365 process. “Every time traffic delays the average UPS route a minute it costs $12.5 million. And they’re adding minutes all the time.” Humes: Oh yes. One of the people I write about in the book was the head of UPS in the Los Angeles area: Noel Massie, amazing guy. Here’s a company that moves over 15 million deliveries to our doorsteps every day. He’s a leader in the delivery space, and he’s tearing his hair out — every time traffic delays the average UPS route a minute, that minute costs the company $12.5 million. And they’re adding minutes all the time. It’s the hidden cost of e-commerce. You click on “buy it now,” and you think, “Hey, this is convenient. Amazon is going to deliver me a package by tomorrow, or maybe the same day.” What none of us really get is that we’re creating a truck trip every time we do that. And it’s accelerating. It’s making more traffic. E-commerce is a hidden contributor to traffic. And we’re so in love with it, but we’re not really in love with paying for expanding the capacity of our transportation system to handle those trucks. Knowledge@Wharton: In terms of the technology — at some point, we will most likely have drones doing part of the delivery process. Humes: I just don’t see a future where little drones are flying to our doorstep. Knowledge@Wharton: Really? Humes: But I do know that the delivery companies around the world are lusting after drones, but not little ones — big ones, 747-sized drones. That’s where they see unmanned aircraft as the next disruption and provider of efficiency, lower costs — obviously, because they’re eliminating humans — and also more safety. Knowledge@Wharton: Let’s talk about the highways for a second, because you’re out there in California and you write at the outset of the book about the issues of the Interstate 405 freeway out there. Here in Philadelphia, we have some of the same types of issues with Interstate 95. What is it about the 405 freeway — and obviously the traffic volume is a big part of it — that is maddening to you? Humes: It is an example of a larger phenomenon. Elon Musk … calls it “soul killing.” And a lot of drivers say the number 405 stands for the four or five mile an hour average speed that you can travel on it during peak hours. It really is like that, too. “This is a road where $1.4 billion was spent to add a lane onto a 10-mile stretch. … After it was completed, traffic was worse.” This is a road where $1.4 billion was spent to add a lane onto a 10-mile stretch, a critical portion of this very busy and important freeway. The idea was to ease congestion. After it was completed, traffic was worse, because when you add lanes, what you really are doing is just inviting more cars to come to the party. Adding capacity without changing the driving behavior, without providing some kind of incentive or disincentive to drive at peak times doesn’t work. It’s been proven over and over again around the country. And the cool part about the 405 freeway was this event called “Carmageddon,” when they had to close down that same 10-mile stretch for a period of 53 hours in order to knock down some bridges so they could add that lane. During that 53 hours, traffic throughout Los Angeles got better — congestion eased because people changed their behavior. When you can get people to drive differently, or not drive, or drive at a different time, that’s how you improve traffic without adding lanes. That’s the secret sauce. Knowledge@Wharton: So it really does start with the people that are involved in this process on a day-to-day basis? Sponsored Content: Humes: Yes. Half the cars on the road at rush hour aren’t driving to work. They’re elective trips for something that’s not job-related. Which means if you can get people to defer those trips, to do them earlier or later, and there are ways to do that, we can eliminate traffic without a single bulldozer blade. Knowledge@Wharton: You alluded to the fact that with some changes in belief, in structure, in philosophy, companies and people could save massive amounts of money that really could affect the economy in a variety of different ways. Humes: Absolutely. Just as increased traffic congestion is a cost, taking it away creates savings. We lost about $160 billion to the economy in 2015 just from traffic delays and congestion and the wasted fuel they cause. So yes, there’s a huge payoff. One idea is that you could have major employers, public and private sector, in a metropolitan area like Los Angeles, cooperate and stagger starting times for their workforce. It could be a voluntary program; there could be tax incentives to encourage it. But the effect would be to have commuters entering the driving space at different times rather than all at the peak rush hour times. If even 10% of the commuting population in a large city defers their commute by half an hour, it could reduce congestion almost magically. Knowledge@Wharton: I would expect you to be a proponent of the work-from-home philosophy. Humes: Enormously, because carpooling isn’t working. We’re seeing declining amounts of people carpooling over the years. So that would be an alternative. The other thing that cities around the world like London have demonstrated successfully is congestion pricing. You could replace the gasoline tax — eliminate it, it’s a regressive tax — and replace it with congestion pricing. It’s a toll that goes up at rush hour and down at off-peak hours, just like we price electricity. That, too, has been highly successful, because it eliminates that 50% of rush hour drivers who don’t really need to be there. Knowledge@Wharton: How might data improve this in the years to come? Humes: On a personal level it’s already improving. There are traffic apps, crowd-sourcing ones like Waze that amass data in real time and allow you to change the way you go places and avoid traffic. That’s been highly effective. And of course, companies with large fleets are using their own proprietary systems — FedEx and UPS — to do the same thing. So data on the personal level has been having a big impact. Free apps, for goodness sakes: Who would have thought that such a thing could make driving more efficient for us? But it certainly has. Knowledge@Wharton: I think that the passage of time will change this as well. As more baby boomers head into retirement … they will be replaced on the roads by millennials, who will adopt Waze and other similar apps, which make reducing congestion a little bit easier. “We lead the world in our ability to move goods by rail but we are woefully behind in our ability to move people on rail.” Humes: Oh, yes. And, of course, the rise of the smartphone has also empowered ride-sharing, which is a huge disruptor. And when you combine that with the evolving technology of driverless vehicles, that’s a new paradigm for how we use and deploy cars — and whether or not we even want to own them in the future. We may just buy car time like we buy phone minutes, once driverless technology is mature. Knowledge@Wharton: What about the rail industry and its impact in this whole process? Humes: The U.S. is schizophrenic on rail. We lead the world in our ability to move goods by rail but we are woefully behind in our ability to move people on rail. We’ve invested massively in the one and taken away investment in the other. If you want to look at an effective rail system, America’s freight rail is pretty much the one you want to seek out and copy. And if you want to look at poor choices on our passenger traffic, then you could also look at how we’ve allowed our rail capacity to decay, particularly in the Northeast Corridor. There’s infrastructure in that corridor that dates back practically to the Civil War, tunnels that are 100 years old. And it’s just one of many areas where we have lost the ability to maintain what we have. There’s a $3.6 trillion backlog in repairs to our transportation infrastructure. It’s enormous. Knowledge@Wharton: Who has the best opportunity to make the changes necessary? Washington is one avenue, but whether they can be effective is about a 50/50 proposition. I’d expect there are a lot of great minds out there who are coming up with ideas. Humes: But we can’t be governed by old thinking. A lot of the investments that we’re making — and they’re incredibly expensive ones like adding lanes to freeways like the 405 — really aren’t achieving what we want to achieve, which is to make traffic move better and more efficiently. We need to rethink what we’re investing in. And it’s not all about the ribbon-cutting moments. Some of the things are much simpler and yet could have a much higher payoff. Knowledge@Wharton: What are some of the developments you expect to see? Humes: Well, they’re across the board. We’re continually seeing larger container ships bringing goods to our ports. In one sense, that’s welcome, because that’s bigger efficiency, it creates jobs. I spend a lot of the time at the port watching these amazing vessels come in. They’re a manmade wonder. But on the other hand when you have ships arriving that carry enough goods to stock 10 Walmart superstores all at once coming off on trucks, where are those trucks going to go? There’s no room on the roads for them. It’s like a tidal wave every time one of these big ships hits the shore, and creates huge concerns for smog, for traffic. If we’re going to have this outsourced-goods economy continue, we need to create the right infrastructure to handle it. Knowledge@Wharton: Many of these companies are making changes … yet there are still a lot of companies that probably are saying “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” Not understanding that it is broken and it needs to be fixed. Humes: There’s something like 60,000 bridges — just to name one category — that need repair around the country. One of them went out on a major freeway out here in California, the Interstate 10, a major goods corridor freeway — a little tiny bridge that washed out in a storm. If it had been maintained properly it wouldn’t have washed out. Every day that was closed, it cost the trucking and goods-moving industry $2.5 million. That’s just one bridge out of 60,000, so you can see what allowing our infrastructure to decay can do to the economy. It is a massive risk that just grows. Anywhere you look you’re going to find it — in every state, in every city. It’s a struggle. In the last century we’ve had two big infrastructure investments in this country. There was the Franklin Roosevelt era, when all the great public works that we still rely on — the Hoover Dam and the Golden Gate Bridge and so forth — were erected. All parts of the transportation infrastructure. And then there was the Interstate highway construction under the Eisenhower administration. If you take away those two big building booms and investments by the government, huge investments, the U.S. has invested much less in terms of its gross domestic product in transportation than almost any other developed nation in the world. And we’re not keeping up. Knowledge@Wharton: When you think about the push for driverless cars … companies, like Apple and Google, that are trying to bring this technology forward, are really at the edge of a major tipping point. Yet in some respects, they still battle old conventional wisdom from the 1950s and 1960s. Humes: And that’s the problem. Whenever you try to integrate something new and disruptive in an old system — I mean, the car that we drive today is a fancied-up version of what was invented 100 years ago — trying to integrate those new ideas is really the difficult part. Once you get a majority of, let’s say, driverless vehicles on the road, then things get easy. But it’s that early mix that is proving problematic. “Are we willing to take our hands off the steering wheel? Because we all think we’re better drivers than we really are.” Knowledge@Wharton: What do you think would be the right mix of what needs to happen for our highways and our delivery system? Humes: There are three things that could happen in the next 20 years that would be optimal. I’ve spent time driving around in the Google car, and I’ve got to tell you, I’m convinced that that technology, once it’s mature, would save tens of thousands of lives every year and create enormous efficiencies. The idea of car ownership and human drivers in those cars is something that’s going to go away. It’s going to be like the horse. Driving is going to be recreation, it’s not going to be what we depend upon. It’s going to happen in the goods-movement sector first, because the trucking companies are champing at the bit. But we have to prepare for the negative impact of that, which is a decline in an important source of employment. We can’t forsake the people who are at the heart of our goods movement industry now whose jobs would be at risk from driverless technology. So that’s one challenge. The next one is to use that technology not just to have a million cars on the roads shuttling people around, but to solve the problem of getting people to take the train and other big pieces of mass transit, because it can solve that first mile, last mile problem. Solve the inconvenience of getting to the train station. The driverless car comes and drops you off. It’s all part of the same app that you would tap to get a trip to get you where you want to go. So the technology and the change that it could bring could solve most of the negative sides of our transportation system, but it’s going to take time, and it’s going to take a change in mindset, which is the third thing. Are we willing to take our hands off the steering wheel? Because we all think we’re better drivers than we really are. But I looked at a day in America’s roads when I was writing Door to Door, looked at every fatal accident in the country. They are virtually all caused by bad decisions by human beings who are distracted or drinking or speeding. Those are the three things that kill us. It’s not defects in cars. It’s not bad road design. It’s that humans really aren’t capable of doing what we’re asking ourselves to do in cars. And it’s time for that to change. Knowledge@Wharton: So we’re giving them too many options while they’re in the car? Humes: We’re just not good drivers. It’s hard for us. We’re good drivers in spurts, but we all think we can multitask, and it turns out, you talk to the people at the National Safety Council, they explain very vigorously that human brains can do one thing well at one time. Multitasking is just another term for distraction. Knowledge@Wharton: I guess the point to tackle then, is since we’ve seen so many more people move into cities, where the Ubers and the Lyfts of the world are able to take care of them, is to be able to maximize that out in the suburbs. Humes: Yes, although the ride-sharing industry has caught on in smaller towns. It’s not just big cities. And the potential for driverless vehicles isn’t limited to the urban areas. But yes, those are the places where traffic and a lot of the negative issues associated with it are most intense. So I suppose it’s likely that’s where we’re going to see the technology deployed first.

The Georgian Bay beachfront has seen a steady decline in tourism for years, but a new proposal to revive the town’s fortunes has sparked division at city hall. Proponents of a new development proposal say Wasaga Beach needs a "bold" step" after a steady decline in tourists in recent years. By Betsy PowellCity Hall Bureau Sun., Jan. 22, 2017 WASAGA BEACH—A bundled-up couple walking a dog and a lone snowmobiler had the world’s longest freshwater beach to themselves on a recent morning as a frigid wind swept across Georgian Bay. “Nothing down here will open. Who’s going to come and park here when it’s cold?” Deputy Mayor Nina Bifolchi says, driving past a stretch of closed-for-three-seasons fast-food eateries and bars facing the beach. She was on the losing side when council voted to buy the properties for $13.8 million in 2015, using money borrowed from a bank and the province. That’s no small sum for the town of 18,000 that will collect $20.3 million in property taxes this year and spend $48 million in operating and capital costs. But waterfront purchase proponents, led by Mayor Brian Smith, argue Wasaga Beach needed a “bold” step after a steady decline in tourists — the town’s economic lifeblood — of roughly 100,000 a year between 2002 and 2012, compounded by a massive fire in 2007 that destroyed a bustling street mall in the beach’s east end. The mall was never rebuilt and has since been replaced by a beer garden and kiosks.

Buying the buildings was a way to generate rent revenue and help keep property tax increases to a minimum, he said. The town collected $674,000 in rental income from the properties in 2016. But there were also property management, capital repair and loan repayment costs, in addition to headaches such as unpaid rent, which the town must now chase in small claims court. And last summer, two businessmen filed a multimillion-dollar lawsuit against the town and Smith, over the leasing of beachfront bars Bananas and Copa Cabana. “The plaintiffs state that the defendants’ conduct was harsh, vindictive, reprehensible and malicious and high-handed,” the statement of claim says. Smith and the town deny any wrongdoing in their statement of defence. The case is still before the courts. Today, the efficacy of the purchase is hotly debated in a town with no shortage of past revitalization efforts. “I say there’s a cupboard in the basement of Wasaga town hall that’s full of dusty plans,” says resident and businessman Alan Clegg, who posts biting observations about the local scene on Facebook. Clegg had lots of fodder in 2016 after the town kicked in $2,600 for a promotional trip to the Hard Rock Café in Toronto’s Dundas Square that featured swimwear models — and Smith — posing beside the Wasaga Beach Brewing Co.’s fluorescent green 1975 Volkswagen bus. The town also paid a local artist $3,800 for a song that originally included the beer company’s motto, “That’s how we say cheers around here,” before the lyrics were “adjusted,” Smith said. “It’s a great, catchy tune that suits Wasaga Beach very well.” But what suits the town’s future best has also sharply divided the seven-member council, triggering accusations of backroom deals, secret meetings and name-calling, and nine complaints to the town’s integrity commissioner, Robert J. Swayze. Last year Swayze — who has worked with 20 municipalities — cautioned Wasaga’s council in a report to councillors. “I have come close to recommending sanctions where excessive political infighting is affecting the ability of a council to do its business,” he wrote. “I am beginning to have this concern in Wasaga Beach and will take that into account in reviewing any future complaints.” Victtoria (foreground), Laura and Daniela soak up some rays at Wasaga Beach during Victoria Day long weekend.  (Brendan Kennedy)   Last spring, after serving eight years, businessman Ron Anderson had had enough. He abruptly quit council, calling it a “three-ring circus.” “I didn’t like the way things were being done in the backroom. Things were always settled before council (meetings),” Anderson says. “It was never like that before.” Few expect things to improve in 2017. The pressure to fix the problems is not going away. “It’s a blood sport, being a councillor up here,” says town chronicler Clegg. This month, council will vote on a development plan to spiff up the main beachfront area and turn the town’s moribund Main Street, dotted with dated motels and campsites, into what supporters hope will become a thriving “downtown” hub, with a traffic roundabout, shrubbery, civic square and a multi-use building. Unlike previous “pie in the sky” development schemes, this one is “realistic, affordable and sustainable,” Smith told the Star before Christmas, saying it will attract investment and development and reignite the tourism industry. “We’re the only town in Ontario with a main street with nothing on it,” said Councillor Ron Ego, a former NHL referee. “Ours is a gold mine that leads right to the beach. Other towns would give their right arm for that.” But Bifolchi, a two-term councillor before she was elected deputy mayor in 2014, says the “plan has lots of pretty pictures,” but there are plenty of unanswered questions about funding. “Some members of council have the belief that ‘if you build it they will come,’ Bifolchi says. “While this may be a calculated risk in private business, in my opinion it is unacceptable and irresponsible when public funds are at risk.” Smith told the Star any new development “will not be paid for by the taxpayer,” except for “portions around that, such as a roundabout.” Councillor Sylvia Bray, Bifolchi’s ally on council, doesn’t believe the municipality should be building a Main Street. “As I travel, I see more and more traditional main streets in decline as shoppers spend their money online and at the big box stores or Smart Centre malls. Added to that is my concern that we have vacant (retail) units in our existing strip malls,” Bray wrote, noting Wasaga has a Walmart near its Main Street. “Our beachfront and businesses benefit from visitors for three months of the year,” Bifolchi says. “However, we were elected to represent all of the residents of Wasaga Beach, including those who live, work and pay taxes here 12 months a year.” Proponents of a new development proposal say Wasaga Beach needs a "bold" step" after a steady decline in tourists in recent years. Bray and Bifolchi opposed spending $350,000 to hire a firm to come up with a “blueprint for developing a unique and functional downtown that will attract private-sector investment,” according to a town report. The plan was jointly funded by the province, Regional Tourism Organization 7 and a local developer. The town’s share was $25,000. Bifolchi said it was a “duplication and waste of money” after the town spent $57,000 on a 2011 beachfront study. Last year, following a request for proposal process, an evaluation committee chose Forrec Ltd., a Toronto-based amusement and water park design company. Forrec knew Wasaga Beach. The firm was part of the consulting team that worked on an earlier study, called the Blue Beach Plan, that some billed the Disney of Wasaga. That plan proposed developing a 27-acre site to transform Wasaga into a year-round destination. But by 2010, that dream had dissolved, the developers were bankrupt, facing fraud-related charges, and “again, Wasaga Beach was a little worse off than when they got here,” Smith said. Back at the beach, a bitter wind rustles the price tags dangling from the racks of sandals, Crocs and Hawaiian shirts outside Pedro’s souvenir/gift shop, a short walk up from the beach and one of the few businesses open at the eastern end of town. Inside, owner Jack Prezio tends to his lone customer, a Cuba-bound woman looking for a bathing suit, amid the eclectic clutter of moccasins, earmuffs, costume jewelry, postcards and T-shirts. Prezio bought the building back in 1949 and digs up a stack of faded postcards capturing the beach in its heyday. He’s still in awe, though bound for Florida soon. “Have you ever seen such a large body of sand and beach in all your freaking life?” But Prezio, like others, is wary of yet another redevelopment plan. “Will this one come alive? Who knows? But there are people out there with money and they don’t know what to do with it. But they’ve got to do it in a place it makes sense.” Delivered dailyThe Morning Headlines Newsletter Subscribe The Toronto Star and thestar.com, each property of Toronto Star Newspapers Limited, One Yonge Street, 4th Floor, Toronto, ON, M5E 1E6.

Loyd was accused of shooting and killing a Florida police officer. As seen in the below video, Markeith had plenty to say during his first court appearance on Thursday, January 19. As the judge tried to read Loyd’s charges at the Orange County Jail, in Orlando, Loyd talked about the news media not portraying things as he thought they should. Loyd is also accused of killing his pregnant ex-girlfriend. Warning: The following videos contain language and violent situations that might be disturbing to some viewers. Markeith was captured by police after a more than weeklong manhunt. When Markeith showed up in videos that went viral around the web, Loyd ending up cursing at the judge as Markeith was dismissed. Loyd claimed that he was a hardworking man and that cops beat him and took his eye, adding he wasn’t resisting arrest when police found him. Instead, Markeith claimed he crawled out to cops on the ground. Indeed, the Orlando Police Department released a video that showed Loyd getting kicked and stomped in the face — as the helicopter videographer quickly turns away from the police beating Markeith. The consensus on social media shows that not a lot of people have much sympathy for his pleas since Sade Dixon, Markeith’s ex-girlfriend, was allegedly slaughtered by Loyd on December 13. However, some are noting the disparity between how Loyd’s eye was injured compared to how Dylann Roof was treated to Burger King, according to the New York Daily News, after Roof slaughtered nine people. When Orlando police Lt. Debra Clayton tried to take Markeith into custody at a Walmart in Orlando on January 9, Loyd reportedly killed her as well. Therefore, it stands to reason for some people who are siding with police on social media that Orlando authorities would be angry when they finally found Loyd on Tuesday evening in an abandoned home in the Carver Shores neighborhood. Other people are debating back and forth on social media that authorities had no right to beat and stomp him no matter how heinous his crimes. As reported by ClickforOrlando.com, more than seven minutes into the helicopter video, Markeith crawls on his stomach to a group of police. Loyd is seen on the ground in the midst of a sea of police, with the figures showing up in night vision. The full video of Loyd’s arrest caused controversy, and Police Chief John Mina spoke at a press conference on Thursday to address the melee. Mina claimed that police feared Loyd could have had some kind of device or weapon in Markeith’s body armor, due to the way Loyd crawled and struggled at crawling towards the cops. According to police, Loyd had “a large bag of ammunition” underneath him and had previously gotten rid of two guns, one of which had the capability shooting off 100 rounds via a magazine. Orlando Police Department undated mugshot shows Markeith Loyd [Image by Orlando Police Department/AP Images] Due to Markeith’s violent history and non-compliance of putting his hands behind his back, officers used force against Markeith, Mina said. Loyd had a lot to say in court about someone else having a gun, another person being dropped off, and a lot of other confusing things. “They done took my eye. They broke my nose they broke my jaw they did all this s*** said I resisted. I didn’t resist s***. They just did that s*** and they’re trying to hide it from the news people. But I’m here right now.” Markeith Loyd [Image by Red Huber/Orlando Sentinel/AP Images] Meanwhile, comments like the below ones are flowing into social media about Markeith’s viral videos.

FILE: US president Donald Trump. Picture: AFP. Donald Trump Mexico Email Print Tweet Share Reuters | 6 days ago IXMIQUILPAN - Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto and US President Donald Trump will meet at the end of this month to discuss trade, immigration and security issues, as the Latin American leader faces increased populist pressure at home. Trump’s spokesman Sean Spicer told a news conference on Saturday that the two leaders will meet on 31 January, the week after senior officials of both administrations hold bilateral talks in Washington. Trump is committed to renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and would move to withdraw if no “fair deal” is forthcoming, according to the White House website. Pena Nieto, whose popularity has plummeted due to corruption scandals and rising inflation, has been criticised for lacking a clear strategy to counter Trump’s threats to crimp trade and deport illegal immigrants. Seeking to capitalise on that discontent, Mexican 2018 presidential forerunner Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on Saturday said he would tour major US cities starting in February. “Enough of being passive,” Lopez Obrador of the leftist Moreno party said in a statement. “We should put a national emergency plan in place to face the damage and reverse the protectionist policies of Donald Trump.” Lopez Obrador, a former Mexico City mayor mounting his third presidential bid, said at a rally in the border city of Ciudad Acuna that he would “stop the hate promoted by propaganda against migrants.” Many in Mexico are worried about another Trump promise, that he will make Mexico pay for a border wall, possibly by blocking wire transfers out of the United States from Mexican nationals. “We shouldn’t pay for the wall,” said Christina Validez, waiting to pick up a wire transfer from her husband in the United States at a bank in Ixmiquilpan. “It’s the other way around, all United States presidents should be grateful that all the migrants have helped the economy.” The area around Ixmiquilpan, in the central state of Hidalgo and home to some 94,000 people, received about $100 million in foreign remittances in 2015, according to data from Mexico’s central bank, more than 10 times the municipal government’s annual budget. Validez said she depends on the money sent back to make ends meet and she complained about “everything” becoming more expensive after the government hiked regular gasoline prices by 14% at the start of the year. Looting and violent protests followed the gasoline hike around the country. Two people died in Ixmiquilpan in clashes with state and federal police after protesters blockaded a highway and burnt vehicles. On Saturday, Mexicans, many with relatives in the United States, queued for hours outside a bank located in an appliance store in Ixmiquilpan’s town centre. The store had cut back hours, opening only briefly, to process wire transfers and payments after protesters angry about the gasoline hike forced the closure of stores owned by big corporations, demanding support of local businesses. Stores in the town owned by Wal-Mart and convenience store operator Femsa were forced to close and were still shuttered two weeks later. On Friday, people gathered outside a Ford Motor Co showroom in the capital to protest the company’s cancellation of a $1.6 billion investment in an auto plant in Mexico after months of pressure from Trump. During his US tour, Lopez Obrador, who finished second to Pena Nieto in the 2012 presidential vote, plans to meet people of Mexican origin living in major cities, starting 12 February in Los Angeles, then to Chicago, Phoenix and others. Pena Nieto said earlier on Saturday that he highlighted the importance of the US-Mexico relationship on a call with Trump. “We don’t know if the government is defending us, if it’s with us or not,” said Margarita Escamilla, a legal resident in the United States from Ixmiquilpan visiting family. Lopez Obrador “is like all of them, saying he’s going to defend migrants but who knows ... they promise and promise and it stays the same,” she said.

They can be claimed at City Hall. Teen not injured in vehicle-deer crash A Ringtown teenager escaped injury when his vehicle hit a deer in Union Township on Tuesday. State police at Frackville said the 17-year-old was traveling north on Ringtown Boulevard (Route 4033) when the incident occurred around 5:50 p.m. The vehicle was towed. Man suspected of giving false name Weatherly police say a Beaver Meadows man followed a vehicle too close and then gave an officer a fake name. Officers on patrol saw a silver Chevrolet following a vehicle unreasonably close and conducted a traffic stop just outside the borough on Weatherly Plane Road at about 9:30 a.m. Dec. 26. The driver, Justin L. Stevens, 31, Beaver Meadows, told an officer he didn’t have his driver’s license, court papers state, and gave the officer a fake first name. Officers caught onto the lie, according to court records, and brought it to Stevens’ attention, and he eventually admitted to providing the wrong name because he was nervous. Stevens faces false identification to law enforcement and following too close by Weatherly police. The charge was filed Jan. 3 and issued via summons, which he accepted Jan. 6. Man charged for striking son Lansford police filed charges against a borough man, claiming he hit his son. Quint L. Dortch II, 29, was charged with misdemeanors for simple assault and child endangerment. The charges were filed against him Jan. 6 and issued via summons, which he accepted Jan. 12. Arrest papers state Dortch spanked and/or hit the child with a belt on his lower back and right hip that resulted in severe bruising visible days later. Borough police and Carbon County Children and Youth Services were alerted to the incident Nov. 30 through a ChildLine complaint and began investigating that day. Dortch initially told Children and Youth that he hit the child with a belt, causing the injuries to his hip, court papers state, but then when interviewed by police Dec. 21 Dortch claimed he was pressured into the previous statement because authorities intimidate him. Police wrote that Dortch said the child claimed he was injured by a chair in the home and admitted that he disciplines his children by hitting them with a belt, though recently he hit the child in question with his hands. Yet, in a written statement that day, Dortch said he spanked the child with a belt three times the day before he found the bruise, court papers state. Man accused of stuffing pants with stolen loot State police at Hazleton say a Hazle Township man tried stealing more than $300 worth of merchandise from a township store after stuffing items in his pants. Matthew T. Edmonds, 27, was charged with retail theft by troopers and was arraigned Jan. 9 by Magisterial District Judge James Dixon, Hazle Township, who set bail at $5,000. Unable to immediately post the money, he was taken to jail. Boscov’s loss prevention workers spotted him placing several clothing items into his britches, court papers state, and they stopped him after he passed all points of sale without paying. The total loss, according to arrest papers, was calculated to be $384.50. His criminal history showed he had two prior arrests for retail theft and pleaded guilty to them, troopers wrote. Charges filed in stolen card case A Tamaqua man faces charges after Rush Township police say he used another person’s credit card at a township store without permission. Zachary Zerby, 23, faces access device fraud, criminal use of a communication facility, identity theft, theft by unlawful taking, theft by deception and two counts receiving stolen property. The charges were filed against him Jan. 5 and he was arraigned the following day by Magisterial District Judge Christina Hale, Frackville, who released him on $15,000 unsecured bail. The victim contacted police Nov. 21, arrest papers state, to say someone used his card without permission at Wal-Mart in Hometown on Oct. 23 around 4 p.m. When officers obtained store video surveillance they spotted a male, later identified as Zerby, charging $21.52 to the account, police wrote. Zerby also faces charges of possession of a controlled substance and use or possession of drug paraphernalia by Tamaqua police related to a Jan. 6 offense. Gift card scam uncovered A 2016 gift card scam at a Hazle Township store was foiled and resulted in the recent arrest of a woman from Dunmore. Sandra M. Santarsiero, 21, faces two counts each access device fraud and possessing access device knowing it is fraud by state police at Hazleton after the Feb. 18 offense. The charges were filed Aug. 15 and issued via summons, which she accepted Jan. 9. A male purchased a computer at Digital Addition in Laurel Mall with a fraudulent gift card on Jan. 19, 2016, arrest papers state, but when he returned nearly a month later to buy another using a gift card, the owner told him to return to the store later because the computer wasn’t ready. A female, identified as Santarsiero, ended up attempting to pick up the computer later and the owner called state police. Troopers said they found her in possession of two fraudulent Visa gift cards and about $8 in chocolate from Gertrude Hawk, which she purchased using a bogus card. She acknowledged the cards were fraudulent, troopers wrote. Police arrest alleged purse grabber A Sugarloaf Township man is accused in a series of purse and wallet thefts. State police at Hazleton filed two cases against Ryan M. Kline, 24, as a result of incidents Jan. 12 and 13. Arrest papers state Kline took a purse from a vehicle parked at Fuel On on Route 924 in Hazle Township around 10:30 p.m. Jan. 12 while the victim was inside the store. Troopers found Kline in the area and the victim’s belongings except for $150 which was in her wallet. Kline had a hypodermic syringe and a spoon with white residue in his possession at the time, court papers state. Police also found credit/debit cards belonging to two other women in his possession and as troopers investigated, learned they were taken from two vehicles parked on Front Street in Hazle Township, one of which was broken into with a rock used to smash a window, troopers wrote. Some of the items taken from those vehicles were retrieved, arrest papers state. The next day troopers responded to Wal-Mart in Hazle Township at 10:21 p.m. and found Kline took another woman’s wallet while the victim was inside the store. The wallet was inside her purse on top of her shopping cart. Kline was taken into custody there, troopers said, and two hypodermic needles were found in the rear of the store near some of his clothing. He faces a count of criminal mischief, two counts use or possession of drug paraphernalia, three counts each theft by unlawful taking and receiving stolen property and theft from a motor vehicle for the Jan. 12 incident and was charged with use or possession of drug paraphernalia, theft and receiving stolen property for the incident the following day. He was arraigned Jan. 14 by Magisterial District Judge David Barilla, Swoyersville, who set bail at $5,000 in each case for a total of $10,000.

Trump's spokesman Sean Spicer told a news conference on Saturday that the two leaders will meet on January 31, the week after senior officials of both administrations hold bilateral talks in Washington. Trump is committed to renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and would move to withdraw if no "fair deal" is forthcoming, according to the White House website. Meanwhile, Mexican 2018 presidential frontrunner Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador announced plans to tour major US cities in February, raising the pressure on Mexico's government to assert itself with the Trump administration. "Enough of being passive," Lopez Obrador of the leftist Morena party said in a statement. "We should put a national emergency plan in place to face the damage and reverse the protectionist policies of Donald Trump." The populist Lopez Obrador is leading in most early polls ahead of Mexico's 2018 presidential elections. Morena, which he founded after breaking with Mexico's main leftist party, has vowed to fight corruption, disrupt a sweeping reform of the key energy sector and promote a more nationalist vision for the country. Many in Mexico are worried about another Trump promise, that he will make Mexico pay for a border wall, possibly by blocking wire transfers out of the United States from Mexican nationals. "We shouldn't pay for the wall," said Christina Validez, waiting to pick up a wire transfer from her husband in the United States at a bank in Ixmiquilpan. "It's the other way around, all United States presidents should be grateful that all the migrants have helped the economy." The area around Ixmiquilpan, in the central state of Hidalgo and home to some 94,000 people, received about $100 million in foreign remittances in 2015, according to data from Mexico's central bank, more than 10 times the municipal government's annual budget. Stores in the town owned by Wal-Mart and retailer Femsa were recently forced to close by angry protesters. Two weeks later, the shops are still shuttered. Violence following a double-digit hike in gasoline prices this month highlighted Pena Nieto's deepening unpopularity and rising sentiment against multinational companies. On Friday, people gathered outside a Ford Motor Co showroom in the capital to protest the company's cancellation of a $1.6 billion investment in an auto plant in Mexico after months of pressure from Trump. On his US tour, Lopez Obrador - a former Mexico City mayor who finished second to Pena Nieto in the 2012 presidential vote - will meet people of Mexican origin living in major cities, starting February 12 in Los Angeles, then to Chicago, Phoenix and others. Pena Nieto said earlier on Saturday that he highlighted the importance of the US-Mexico relationship on a call with Trump. "We don't know if the government is defending us, if it's with us or not," said Margarita Escamilla, a legal resident in the United States from Ixmiquilpan visiting family. Lopez Obrador "is like all of them, saying he's going to defend migrants but who knows ... they promise and promise and it stays the same," she said.

Trump’s spokesman Sean Spicer told a news conference on Saturday that the two leaders will meet on January 31, the week after senior officials of both administrations hold bilateral talks in Washington. Trump is committed to renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and would move to withdraw if no “fair deal” is forthcoming, according to the White House website. Pena Nieto, whose popularity has plummeted due to corruption scandals and rising inflation, has been criticized for lacking a clear strategy to counter Trump’s threats to crimp trade and deport illegal immigrants. Seeking to capitalize on that discontent, Mexican 2018 presidential forerunner Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on Saturday said he would tour major US cities starting in February. “Enough of being passive,” Lopez Obrador of the leftist Moreno party said in a statement. “We should put a national emergency plan in place to face the damage and reverse the protectionist policies of Donald Trump.” Lopez Obrador, a former Mexico City mayor mounting his third presidential bid, said at a rally in the border city of Ciudad Acuna that he would “stop the hate promoted by propaganda against migrants.” Many in Mexico are worried about another Trump promise, that he will make Mexico pay for a border wall, possibly by blocking wire transfers out of the United States from Mexican nationals. “We shouldn’t pay for the wall,” said Christina Validez, waiting to pick up a wire transfer from her husband in the United States at a bank in Ixmiquilpan. “It’s the other way around, all United States presidents should be grateful that all the migrants have helped the economy.” The area around Ixmiquilpan, in the central state of Hidalgo and home to some 94,000 people, received about $100 million in foreign remittances in 2015, according to data from Mexico’s central bank, more than 10 times the municipal government’s annual budget. Validez said she depends on the money sent back to make ends meet and she complained about “everything” becoming more expensive after the government hiked regular gasoline prices by 14 percent at the start of the year. Looting and violent protests followed the gasoline hike around the country. Two people died in Ixmiquilpan in clashes with state and federal police after protesters blockaded a highway and burnt vehicles. On Saturday, Mexicans, many with relatives in the United States, queued for hours outside a bank located in an appliance store in Ixmiquilpan’s town center. The store had cut back hours, opening only briefly, to process wire transfers and payments after protesters angry about the gasoline hike forced the closure of stores owned by big corporations, demanding support of local businesses. Stores in the town owned by Wal-Mart and convenience store operator Femsa were forced to close and were still shuttered two weeks later. On Friday, people gathered outside a Ford Motor Co showroom in the capital to protest the company’s cancellation of a $1.6 billion investment in an auto plant in Mexico after months of pressure from Trump. During his US tour, Lopez Obrador, who finished second to Pena Nieto in the 2012 presidential vote, plans to meet people of Mexican origin living in major cities, starting February 12 in Los Angeles, then to Chicago, Phoenix and others.

New Enterprise Associates is targeting a whopping $3 billion for its newest fund Posted Jan 17, 2017 by Connie Loizos (@cookie) 0 SHARES Next Story Verizon takes yet more evasive action as ‘thousands’ of customers refuse to give up their Note 7 New Enterprise Associates (NEA), the 40-year-old venture firm, has signaled its intention to raise $3 billion for its 16th fund in a new SEC filing. The Form D states that the first sale has yet to occur, though typically, when a firm registers a fund of this size, it has already soft circled many, if not all, of the commitments from investors to reach its goal. Three billion dollars is a mammoth amount, even for NEA, which closed its last fund with just less than $2.8 billion, with an additional $350 million raised at the same time for an “opportunities” fund for select later-stage portfolio companies. Then again, big funds have become very fashionable as investors look to park their capital with a small number of top VCs, and investors have to be feeling pretty great about NEA right about now. Among the firm’s recent exits was the sale of e-commerce company Jet.com to Walmart for $3.3 billion in cash and stock last August. NEA had led Jet’s $55 million Series A round almost exactly two years earlier. NEA’s sixteenth fund is also coming roughly two years after the close of its fifteenth fund, which is fast by historic standards but typical of the pace that VCs have more recently adopted, with many firms — including Accel Partners, Lightspeed Venture Partners, and Founders Fund — closing on new and massive funds last year after previously closing funds in 2014. NEA invests in everything from seed to very late-stage deals. It has eight offices around the world, including in San Francisco, New York, Beijing, and Mumbai. Last year, NEA lost one of its most beloved investors, Harry Weller, who long led NEA’s East Coast venture practice from Washington, D.C., and who passed away suddenly at age 46. Since then, NEA has established the Harry Weller Big Fund Idea, a charitable giving program administrated by T. Rowe.

Two Glen Rose High School seniors and friends are helping their fellow younger Beavers learn about agriculture and its importance in the food chain. As part of their Advanced Placement literature class, Amy Hendricks and Grace Baker are required to conduct a service project. They have been increasing fourth-graders’ agriculture literacy every other week through a special teaching project. Hendricks noted that some agricultural issues are important to her, such as the use of GMOs to meet a growing population’s food needs, and why it’s important to teach children about agriculture. “Agriculture is a big part of their lives, whether they realize it or not,” Hendricks said. “Agriculture is also an area that needs a lot of attention and development. We need to figure out how to feed a growing population, which means more research needs to be done, and GMO consumption needs to be less stigmatized. “These are issues that are very important and will only become more important as time goes on, which means the younger generation needs to be well informed about them. We hope to give them a solid foundation in agricultural literacy.” Baker is president of the local FFA club, although the project is independent of FFA, Hendrix said. “Grace is very passionate about agriculture and wanted to do this project,” she said. Baker, who plans to pursue an agriculture-education career after college, shared that by the year 2050, 9 billion people will need to be fed. “That means we have to boost our agricultural production by 100 percent before then,” she said. Baker pointed out that in Saline County, there aren’t agricultural programs in the schools, which prompted her to teach the younger students. “I enjoy teaching the kids about agriculture because kids today aren’t taught about where their clothes and food come from. They believe that it all just magically appears in Walmart or Kroger, and I want to help stop that belief,” Baker said. “Hopefully, by the end of the year, the kids in the class will have an understanding on how agriculture helps them live on a day-to-day basis. It is very sad to me that people don’t understand the importance of agriculture, and I hope that the kids will soon.” Both girls have a short history with agriculture and gardening. Hendricks said she grows a garden every year with her mother and is constantly influenced by Baker’s passion. Baker said she realized the importance of agriculture on her first day in agriculture class in the eighth grade. “After that, I got very active in the FFA program, and my love for agriculture runs deeply and passionately,” she said. “Almost everyone at school knows it and even calls me ‘the FFA girl.’ I became treasurer of my chapter in ninth grade and started receiving awards since.” The girls’ lesson plan begins with which crops are grown in Arkansas and around the nation, Hendricks said. “We’ve talked about seed germination, photosynthesis and how climate affects plant growth,” she said. “We started to grow a pineapple with them in the class, and we will later grow some lettuce, peas and tomatoes with them in the greenhouse. At the same time, we’re teaching the kids why agriculture is important to them and their lives.” Their classes began at the beginning of the school year last fall and will go through April, Baker said. “We hope the class following us will take the project that we have started and make it better and make it their own,” Baker said. “We also hope the next class of fourth-graders can get a good knowledge about agriculture.” After high school, Hendricks said, she plans to attend college with aspirations of becoming a doctor. Baker said she plans to attend Southern Arkansas University and major in agriculture education. “With that degree, I would like to either work for Heifer International or the Farm Bureau,” Baker said. “There are endless possibilities for me. My biggest dream is to become a GMO technician, but a girl can only dream.” Tweet ADVERTISEMENT More News Saline County Polar Plunge set for Saturday a...

Since at least the Caesars, prominent public figures have said and done deplorable things that were recorded for posterity. Someone had pen and parchment handy when Julius Caesar said: “If you must break the law, do it to seize power. In all other cases, observe it.” The process once required years, decades, even centuries. Today’s technology has made documentation instantaneous. Video is streamed live on television and the internet. Personal computers and smartphones connect everyone to everything happening anywhere anytime. Today, the first draft of history is typed in 140 characters on Twitter and shared on Facebook. As I watched Donald J. Trump sworn in as Tweeter-in-Chief on Friday, I was reminded of all the deplorable things he said and did on his scorched-earth march to the White House. Since Nov. 8, when Trump was elected by a margin of about 80,000 votes in three swing states, the majority of Americans who didn’t vote for him have been scolded to “get over it” and “give the guy a chance.” I could cite innumerable examples of Republicans attacking the legitimacy of President Obama and their relentless, conspiratorial campaign to sabotage anything he tried to do, but Obama is gone and Trump is the Oaf in Office. I don’t waste time and energy waiting for people to exhibit qualities they do not possess, but I watched the inauguration and Trump’s address. He claimed to have penned the speech himself at Mar-a-Lago, his palatial Palm Beach resort, using a Sharpie and a pad of paper. On Saturday, The Wall Street Journal reported that the speech was actually written by Steve Bannon, the president’s top strategist and a white nationalist. If you love Trump, you likely loved the speech. If you don’t, you couldn’t help but recognize it as a slightly less toxic condensation of his campaign stump speech, with a few phony grace notes tossed in for color. The second paragraph, in which he expressed gratitude to Barack and Michelle Obama for their grace during the transition, was especially hard to swallow. “They have been magnificent,” Trump said. “Thank you.” This is the same man who pushed the racist “birther” lie and didn’t drop it even after President Obama produced his birth certificate. In August 2012, Trump tweeted: “An ‘extremely credible source’ has called my office and told me that Barack Obama’s birth certificate is a fraud.” In September, Trump granted Obama citizenship, saying: “President Barack Obama was born in the United States, period.” He then took credit for debunking the lie he cynically spread for political gain. Back to the speech, and this gem: “You came by the tens of millions to become part of an historic movement, the likes of which the world has never seen before.” Hmm. A charismatic, bombastic bully demonizes the press and political opponents and uses nationalist propaganda to convince the faithful that he alone can “save the nation.” How about Moscow in 1917, Berlin in 1933 or Russia today? “From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land,” President Trump said. “From this day forward, it’s going to be only America first. America first.” Trumpland uber alles! “We will follow two simple rules: Buy American and hire American,” said the president, whose Trump ties, cuff links and other products are made in China. Many in the crowd cheered, apparently unaware that these “two simple rules” could triple the cost of American flag T-shirts at Wal-Mart. Aside from post-apocalyptic phrases like “American carnage” and images of gang and drug-riddled schools and “rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones,” the speech did include a promised call for unity. Delivered by any other president, it might have rung true. President Trump, however, got elected by dividing Americans, appealing to our basest instincts and lying just about every time his mouth was open. The history he made Friday changes none of that. Ask Kellyanne Conway. Not the one who is now a senior adviser to President Trump and his chief apologist, but the Kellyanne Conway who scant months ago was working for Trump rival and Texas Sen. “Lyin’ Ted” Cruz. Back then, she said Trump “says he’s for the little guy, but he’s actually built a lot of his businesses on the backs of the little guy and he’s hurt a lot of little guys through eminent domain, or through not paying contractors after you’ve built something. The little guys have suffered.” She also slammed Trump for using vulgar language, accusing his opponents of “Gestapo” tactics, suggesting that women should be punished for having abortions, ripping off gullible victims with his Trump University scam, behaving in “unpresidential” ways and refusing to release his tax returns. The Kellyanne Conway of today defends President Trump as a champion of the little guy and the victim of Gestapo tactics by Democrats, the intelligence community and a hostile press. What changed? The guy who signs her paychecks. President Trump took over the official @POTUS Twitter page on Friday. The background photo was changed from a shot of the Obamas to an image of a massive, flag-waving crowd cheering the inauguration of a new president. It was from 2009. Social media immediately called out the naked attempt to make President Trump’s historically low inaugural turnout seem more robust. The background photo was changed twice within hours, but history was watching, and the internet is forever. Put that in your browser and tweet it.

Trump’s spokesman Sean Spicer told a news conference on Saturday that the two leaders will meet on Jan 31, the week after senior officials of both administrations hold bilateral talks in Washington. Trump is committed to renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and would move to withdraw if no “fair deal” is forthcoming, according to the White House website. Pena Nieto, whose popularity has plummeted due to corruption scandals and rising inflation, has been criticized for lacking a clear strategy to counter Trump’s threats to crimp trade and deport illegal immigrants. Seeking to capitalize on that discontent, Mexican 2018 presidential forerunner Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on Saturday said he would tour major U.S. cities starting in February. “Enough of being passive,” Lopez Obrador of the leftist Moreno party said in a statement. “We should put a national emergency plan in place to face the damage and reverse the protectionist policies of Donald Trump.” Lopez Obrador, a former Mexico City mayor mounting his third presidential bid, said at a rally in the border city of Ciudad Acuna that he would “stop the hate promoted by propaganda against migrants.” Many in Mexico are worried about another Trump promise, that he will make Mexico pay for a border wall, possibly by blocking wire transfers out of the United States from Mexican nationals. “We shouldn’t pay for the wall,” said Christina Validez, waiting to pick up a wire transfer from her husband in the United States at a bank in Ixmiquilpan. “It’s the other way around, all United States presidents should be grateful that all the migrants have helped the economy.” The area around Ixmiquilpan, in the central state of Hidalgo and home to some 94,000 people, received about $100 million in foreign remittances in 2015, according to data from Mexico’s central bank, more than 10 times the municipal government’s annual budget. Validez said she depends on the money sent back to make ends meet and she complained about “everything” becoming more expensive after the government hiked regular gasoline prices by 14 percent at the start of the year. Looting and violent protests followed the gasoline hike around the country. Two people died in Ixmiquilpan in clashes with state and federal police after protesters blockaded a highway and burnt vehicles. On Saturday, Mexicans, many with relatives in the United States, queued for hours outside a bank located in an appliance store in Ixmiquilpan’s town center. The store had cut back hours, opening only briefly, to process wire transfers and payments after protesters angry about the gasoline hike forced the closure of stores owned by big corporations, demanding support of local businesses. Stores in the town owned by Wal-Mart and convenience store operator Femsa were forced to close and were still shuttered two weeks later. On Friday, people gathered outside a Ford Motor Co showroom in the capital to protest the company’s cancellation of a $1.6 billion investment in an auto plant in Mexico after months of pressure from Trump. During his U.S. tour, Lopez Obrador, who finished second to Pena Nieto in the 2012 presidential vote, plans to meet people of Mexican origin living in major cities, starting Feb. 12 in Los Angeles, then to Chicago, Phoenix and others. Pena Nieto said earlier on Saturday that he highlighted the importance of the U.S.-Mexico relationship on a call with Trump. “We don’t know if the government is defending us, if it’s with us or not,” said Margarita Escamilla, a legal resident in the United States from Ixmiquilpan visiting family. Lopez Obrador “is like all of them, saying he’s going to defend migrants but who knows ... they promise and promise and it stays the same,” she said. (c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2017.

Otherwise it is impossible to take Mexican officials seriously when they criticize the U.S. 0 Kuya 808Jan. 23, 2017 - 11:58AM JST Maybe Trump should ask for a refund on the $75,000,000 that Obama gave Mexico to help build their own wall on their southern border.

In the past three years, Dr. Joel Kutnick, a psychiatrist based in Georgetown, has spent about 222 hours examining 50 criminal defendants in Victoria County. Some of that time was spent reviewing the defendants' medical records, preparing a report to give to a judge or traveling and testifying in court. SOURCE: Victoria County Auditor's Office A jury couldn't decide whether a woman who was eating her feces understood the criminal charges she was facing. Both the prosecution and defense agreed the woman, who was not charged with a violent offense, should be treated before answering her charges, but it wasn't up to them. It was up to the jury, and she waited longer to get treatment, said Jerry Clark, who was a San Patricio County prosecutor from 1997 to 1999. That changed when Senate Bill 1057 became effective in 2004. It allowed judges to make that determination. Robert C. Cheshire, a Victoria district judge at that time, was part of the 16-member task force that drafted the bill. The law is regarded by many as helpful not only for people who have a mental illness and are caught in the criminal justice system but for taxpayers. "It was a godsend when that law passed," said Clark, who is now a defense attorney in Victoria. "In a year and a half, I had to do seven or eight of those competency trials, all of which were agreed to. ... That's a heck of a lot of extra cost." Cheshire learned about mental health issues long before taking the bench in 1994. His father was a general surgeon who delivered babies at hospitals in Victoria and treated the elderly. "He liked treating the whole family and knowing his patients," Cheshire said. Cheshire called the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals and volunteered for the task force. Thirteen years later, he remembers it as a rare moment in Texas politics. Juries can still be used to determine whether a defendant needs mental health treatment before proceeding with his or her criminal case if the defendant requests. But, allowing judges to make the determination with a psychiatrist's report when everyone was in agreement seemed logical by all, Cheshire said. "It just seemed like it was wasting the jurors' time and creating hardships on the mentally ill who needed to get help," he said. "I decided that it was something that was important to try to change." Today, about 90 percent of the times when an attorney asks whether the defendant should receive mental health treatment before proceeding, a jury is not called to make that decision, said Brian Shannon. Shannon was also part of the task force. He's now a professor at the Texas Tech University School of Law in Lubbock. When a jury was called to make that decision before 2004, pickup juries were prevalent. Pickup juries consist of citizens "rounded up to sit as jurors without all the usual procedures for juror identification and selection," Shannon said. Assembling a jury that way is problematic because jurors should represent a cross-section of the community. "Rounding up individuals from the courthouse or from the Wal-Mart parking lot is just very inconsistent with what our expectations are about having a fair and appropriate system," he said. SB 1057 also made the court-ordered psychiatric exams of defendants more consistent. It mandated that the psychiatrist performing the exams have continuing education. "On occasion, we did see reports that rambled," Victoria County District Attorney Stephen Tyler said. "This gave them an outline. This kept them focused." Dr. Joel Kutnick, of Georgetown, examines most defendants in the area using televideo conferencing software. The state law requires he reports his findings within 30 days. Kutnick usually does so in half the time, enabling defendants to get on a long list of those waiting to be admitted into one of the state's crowded psychiatric hospitals, Cheshire said. The change in the law was positive, but the mentally ill who need treatment still stay in jails "for an unduly long period of time," Shannon said. "We need to do a better job as a state to have sufficient resources to handle the demand," he said. "The more efforts we can make in the community with providing mental health services more broadly, the better opportunity we'll have to get people into treatment before they get caught up in the criminal justice system."

In the next 18 months, the US is gearing up to transition debit and credit cards away from the magnetic stripe to embedded chip technology, which is already widely used in Europe, Asia and beyond. Who can you thank for the long-overdue upgrade? Target, whose data security breach earlier this year highlighted the security flaws in the magnetic stripe system. It’s a 50-year-old technology, after all, and it’s much easier to counterfeit than the computer chip in your next Visa card. In addition to adding a chip to each of the 1.2 billion credit and debit cards circulating in the US, the rehaul requires upgrading card readers at retail locations, and there’s plenty of incentive for businesses to hop on board with the change. If your local WalMart doesn’t adopt new compatible card readers, it will be held accountable for any fraudulent face-to-face transactions. Point-of-sale systems used by smaller businesses, such as Square and PayPal here, will need to reissue card scanners as well. According to research firm Javelin, the upgrade could take about three years, with international and premium cards getting the switch to the new system. For the record, there are already several cards with chip technology available to Americans, from American Express and JPMorgan Chase among other institutions… Read more from Engadget. by Staff on May 8, 2014May 8, 2014 Fiat Lux Post navigation Fighting bigotry with the free market For Russia, new tactics, same strategy Sponsored The Stanford Review is proud to be sponsored by UP2U Printing.

(AP Photo/Dario Lopez-Mills, File) Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto and US President Donald Trump will meet at the end of this month to discuss trade, immigration and security issues, as the Latin American leader faces increased populist pressure at home. Trump’s spokesman Sean Spicer told a news conference on Saturday that the two leaders will meet on Jan. 31, the week after senior officials of both administrations hold bilateral talks in Washington. Trump is committed to renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and would move to withdraw if no “fair deal” is forthcoming, according to the White House website. Watch What Else Is Making News Meanwhile, Mexican 2018 presidential frontrunner Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador announced plans to tour major US cities in February, raising the pressure on Mexico’s government to assert itself with the Trump administration. “Enough of being passive,” Lopez Obrador of the leftist Morena party said in a statement. “We should put a national emergency plan in place to face the damage and reverse the protectionist policies of Donald Trump.” The populist Lopez Obrador is leading in most early polls ahead of Mexico’s 2018 presidential elections. Morena, which he founded after breaking with Mexico’s main leftist party, has vowed to fight corruption, disrupt a sweeping reform of the key energy sector and promote a more nationalist vision for the country. Many in Mexico are worried about another Trump promise, that he will make Mexico pay for a border wall, possibly by blocking wire transfers out of the United States from Mexican nationals. “We shouldn’t pay for the wall,” said Christina Validez, waiting to pick up a wire transfer from her husband in the United States at a bank in Ixmiquilpan. “It’s the other way around, all United States presidents should be grateful that all the migrants have helped the economy.” The area around Ixmiquilpan, in the central state of Hidalgo and home to some 94,000 people, received about $100 million in foreign remittances in 2015, according to data from Mexico’s central bank, more than 10 times the municipal government’s annual budget. Stores in the town owned by Wal-Mart and retailer Femsa were recently forced to close by angry protesters. Two weeks later, the shops are still shuttered. Violence following a double-digit hike in gasoline prices this month highlighted Pena Nieto’s deepening unpopularity and rising sentiment against multinational companies. On Friday, people gathered outside a Ford Motor Co showroom in the capital to protest the company’s cancellation of a $1.6 billion investment in an auto plant in Mexico after months of pressure from Trump. On his US tour, Lopez Obrador – a former Mexico City mayor who finished second to Pena Nieto in the 2012 presidential vote – will meet people of Mexican origin living in major cities, starting Feb. 12 in Los Angeles, then to Chicago, Phoenix and others. Pena Nieto said earlier on Saturday that he highlighted the importance of the US-Mexico relationship on a call with Trump. “We don’t know if the government is defending us, if it’s with us or not,” said Margarita Escamilla, a legal resident in the United States from Ixmiquilpan visiting family. Lopez Obrador “is like all of them, saying he’s going to defend migrants but who knows … they promise and promise and it stays the same,” she said.

The robbery took place at a Kay Jewelers outlet in the Rolling Oaks Mall in San Antonio, Police Chief William McManus said in a video posted on the city's Facebook page. Two bystanders tried to intervene, one of whom was shot and killed by one of the robbers. The other bystander, who was licensed to carry a concealed firearm, shot and wounded the other suspect, who was later hospitalized, McManus said. The first robber ran through the mall, firing his gun as he fled, shooting six people. San Antonio police said he was caught after crashing a stolen vehicle that contained two guns, and was charged with capital murder and two counts of aggravated assault. "It's absolutely senseless. This is the second time that a Good Samaritan was killed trying to intervene in a crime," McManus said. On the day after Thanksgiving, a person who tried to stop a woman from being assaulted was shot to death outside a San Antonio Walmart that was packed with holiday shoppers. The six shoppers shot on Sunday were hospitalized in undetermined condition, the police chief said. Their identities were not disclosed. The robber who was shot was in critical condition but expected to survive. Authorities said he would also be charged with capital murder and aggravated assault. The mall, located in the northwestern part of the city, was locked down while police hunted for the second suspect.

Dick Anderson, who lacked retail experience when he took the helm of the first Andersons store, says it was ‘a mess.’ COURTESY OF THE ANDERSONS Regarding the decision to close The Andersons stores, Dick Anderson says, ‘I’ve been seeing us lose that battle for a long time. It’s time to say, let’s move on, you know?’ THE BLADE/ANDY MORRISON Buy This Image Dick Anderson reflects on the history of The Andersons retail stores. THE BLADE/ANDY MORRISON Buy This Image Customers wait in line inside the first Andersons store. The store was an outgrowth of the grain elevator business; farmers coming to drop off grain would buy things they needed. COURTESY OF THE ANDERSONS The first Andersons store opened in 1952 on Illinois Avenue in Maumee. COURTESY OF THE ANDERSONS Share Tweet Share Email Comments Print It was 1944 and the world had been at war for three years. In Maumee, Harold Anderson was running his dairy farm and recuperating from the physical and mental exhaustion of twice trying and failing to start his own grain elevator company since 1937. One evening he took his 15-year-old son, Richard, for a drive and stopped near a vacant field on Conant Street near Illinois Avenue. “He said to me, ‘Dickie my boy, someday you’re going to be running a big store on that property right there,’” Richard P. “Dick” Anderson, now 87, recalled last week. Eight years later in 1952, The Andersons Warehouse Market — a store where farmers could get seed, livestock feed, fertilizer, and farm supplies — did spring up in Maumee on Illinois Avenue, just down the road from the site on Conant.  And in 1956, Dick Anderson, just fresh out of the U.S. Army, was chosen by his father to run it. Mr. Anderson, now chairman emeritus of The Andersons Inc., talked to The Blade about the company’s venture into retail.  RELATED CONTENT: Andersons stores died ’nibble’ by ’nibble’ Customers wait in line inside the first Andersons store. The store was an outgrowth of the grain elevator business; farmers coming to drop off grain would buy things they needed. COURTESY OF THE ANDERSONS Enlarge The Andersons, now a $4.2 billion agribusiness of grain, ethanol, railcar, and plant nutrients, announced a week ago that it would close its money-losing general stores in Toledo and Columbus in the spring and end jobs for 1,050 people.  The news was a shock to the Toledo community, which has come to know the primarily agricultural business through its stores. Even though Mr. Anderson jokingly described the first store as “a mess,” over 65 years the retail unit grew, moved across the street, changed formats, became multiple stores, and evolved into a big-box anything-goes concept beloved by Toledo area shoppers. But the chairman emeritus said the family had a statement of principles forged decades ago, which say that they believed in “the free enterprise system and we believe that there are winners and losers.” He said last week, “And we hate to admit it, but we’re a loser in this one. And we’ve got to face the consequences.” But the long run of the stores might not have been visible at the outset. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, The Andersons built a huge grain elevator operation in Maumee, drawing farmers from 150 miles away who could drop off grain in 10 minutes and leave with a check. “We were being flooded by these farm trucks, small trucks. The families would come, so it didn’t take a brain surgeon or a genius to recognize we had a great opportunity to sell things back to them,” Mr. Anderson said. His father wanted to make sure they loved coming to Maumee, getting more money for their grain than elsewhere and buying goods, he said. Dick Anderson, who lacked retail experience when he took the helm of the first Andersons store, says it was ‘a mess.’ COURTESY OF THE ANDERSONS Enlarge However, Harold Anderson didn’t make things easy on Dick, who lacked retail experience. “He wanted to operate on a 5 percent margin. Whatever it cost you, just mark it up 5 percent no matter where it falls,” he said. Also, he said his father cautioned, “Be careful about trying to have too much service. It’s cash and carry. We would accept checks, but absolutely no accounts.” Dick Anderson said he had a friend in the toy business, so the store started selling toys. “My goodness, we sold millions of dollars of toys in that store. It just shocked everybody downtown,” he said. Harold Anderson was well connected with the movers and shakers in Toledo and would always invite them to his burgeoning grain operation to show them what he was doing. One day, said Dick Anderson, the patriarch brought the president of Lamson’s Bros. department stores, Vern Kettle, to Maumee to show him the warehouse store. “The store was a damn mess but the prices were incredible and it made him mad,” Mr. Anderson said. “He got ahold of me and took me up to a counter where there were [empty spaces] in what was being sold there. And he said, ‘Why isn’t that full?’ He was mad,” the chairman emeritus said with a laugh. Dick Anderson said the stores were subsidized by the company. After two years of the store, Mr. Anderson said his father let him mark up some items 15 percent. “The first year I had that freedom we made a quarter of a million dollars. That really got my dad’s attention, I’ll tell you,” he explained. Still, the store wasn’t well run at that time, Mr. Anderson said. He had to learn how to operate a store and hired some retail experts. But, he added, “It was fun run. It really was a fun run.” Historically, the building of the St. Lawrence Seaway in 1959 really shaped The Andersons stores closer to what customers know it as today, Mr. Anderson said. The first Andersons store opened in 1952 on Illinois Avenue in Maumee. COURTESY OF THE ANDERSONS Enlarge The seaway changed northwest Ohio and the Toledo port area into a global grain port. The Andersons responded by building grain terminals on the Maumee, which meant large grain hauling trucks came to Maumee and Toledo instead of family farmers. “The type of things that farmers were buying at that time, chicken coops and a lot of hand-held equipment, the truck drivers weren’t interested in at all,” he explained. “They were interested in fertilizer, and we sold a lot of fertilizer at that time. But more and more our focus shifted on the homeowner. “Then we realized that we were about 80 percent male with our shoppers and we were missing the whole female contingent. That’s when we got into food and lot of other things.” The Andersons retail operations had substantial growth in the late 1960s, ’70s, and early ’80s. The company added a Farm Supply Sales store in Maumee to sell building products and farm items; opened tire shops, garden centers in Columbus and Sylvania. It opened warehouse stores in Champaign, Ill., and Delphi, Ind., though both failed after five years. In 1972, the Warehouse Market on Illinois Avenue moved across the street into its current 155,000-square-foot, 25-acre site and was renamed the Maumee General Store and Garden Center. The Andersons later opened General Stores in Toledo, Columbus (two), Northwood, and Lima. The Northwood and Lima stores later closed. “When we started, we were a farm store and hardware was the thing,” Mr. Anderson said. “We were a sensation in tools and hardware because our margins were so low. So we got a reputation because we had the product and we had a competitive price.” But, he explained, the company’s stores in Columbus in the mid-1980s faced “the big guys,” Home Depot and Lowe’s and Walmart, and it was a struggle from the start. “We were barely profitable,” he said. “That kind of took the shine off any further expansion until we figured it out.” Over the past 10 years, retail nationwide has changed, and for The Andersons it is no longer a viable operation, the chairman emeritus said. The company’s stores faced competition in every niche of products it sells, and online shopping is stealing customers. “The shock among the shopping public is interesting to me. People just cannot believe that the company was not successful,” Mr. Anderson said. “We were running a good operation. I was proud of the esprit de corps. Wonderful people, part-timers that have been with us 20 or 30 years,” he said. But shopping trends and technology changed, and the stores ultimately couldn’t compete, he said. The company said its stores lost $20 million since 2008. Mr. Anderson said he is concerned about the people who will lose their jobs, but he is all right with the decision to shutter the stores. “There’s great relief in me because I’ve been seeing us lose that battle for a long time,” he said. “It’s a constant load and it’s time to say, ‘Let’s move on,’ you know?” Contact Jon Chavez at: jchavez@theblade.com or 419-724-6128.

Multiple injuries were reported in the area.  The names of the victims who lost their lives are Ernest Perkins, 58; Cleveland Madison, 20; David Wayne McCoy, 47; and Simona Cox, 72. Extensive damage was reported on Arledge Street near the Hattiesburg Police Department. Damage was evident for multiple blocks; structures destroyed, roofs missing, downed trees and power lines. William Carey University also took a major hit from the storm. "There are some minor injuries," said Mia Overton, William Carey public relations coordinator. "Officials are working to ensure students are safe and accounted for. There is damage to most buildings on campus including cars and a home across campus is damaged." Hattiesburg Mayor Johnny DuPree advised any resident in need of help to call the City Action Line at 601-545-4500. Fire station number 2 in Downtown Hattiesburg suffered a direct hit. Power lines blocked one of their firetrucks and power crews had to report to the scene trying to assist. Firefighters from that station left on foot to assist those in need.  Emergency crews rescued a woman who was trapped inside her home in Downtown Hattiesburg. She was transported by medics. Multiple gas lines were ruptured and broken in Downtown Hattiesburg and Petal. Mississippi Power and other utility crews worked quickly for days to restore services.  Extensive damage was reported on Sullivan Kilraine Road and Richburg Road in Lamar County.  The Living Word Church on Tatum Road by PCS took significant damage from the storm as well.  Emergency officials are still urging everyone to stay away from affected areas due to the debris and downed power lines. Curfews are still in effect for the areas damaged in the City of Hattiesburg, but Petal cancelled their curfew Wednesday.  MOBILE USERS: View photos of tornado damage here.  The City of Petal suffered extensive damage to many neighborhoods, schools and businesses. The strip mall near Foxes Pizza was destroyed. Walmart suffered significant damage, but have since reopened. Search and rescue teams were deployed to assist Forrest County emergency management in the Hattiesburg area. The State Emergency Operations Center is activated providing resources as needed from counties. Storm shelters opened across the Pine Belt. Gov. Phil Bryant held a news conference with city and state emergency officials to update the public on recovery efforts. Bryant requested federal assistance from the White House, sending a letter to President Donald Trump.  Trump signed a disaster declaration on Wednesday. To learn how to apply for assistance, click here.  Bryant also said National Guardsman will be present in the ares for at least a week helping local law enforcement prevent looting in affected areas.  MEMA will provide updates as information becomes available.

CitiTower is set for completion in July 2017. (Handout) Mary ShanklinContact ReporterOrlando Sentinel The days of business dominating growth in downtown Orlando and Central Florida retailers building empires by selling merchandise aren't dead — completely. But the driving forces behind commercial real estate in the greater Orlando area have shifted so much that those days seem numbered. Central Florida's commercial real estate brokers have geared up for a year that promises more new apartments in downtown Orlando, more offices in the suburbs and more retailers selling "experiences." Throughout the region, multi-family developments are the project du jour. "I think the downtown market is going to continue to do really well. A number of projects are coming on line so leasing will be competitive," said Shelton Granade, vice chairman of CBRE's Investment Properties Group. "It really feels to us like downtown Orlando is just maturing as a kind of 24/7 city where people do want to live and there's a deeper rental pool and part of that draw is just the amenities."

(Jan. 23, 2017) Caption Orlando International Airport battles Melbourne airport over name - Orlando News Now Airport leaders take issue with the Brevard County airport including Orlando in its name, primarily because of the distance between the two airports. It's about 60 miles from Orlando's city limits.. Airport leaders take issue with the Brevard County airport including Orlando in its name, primarily because of the distance between the two airports. It's about 60 miles from Orlando's city limits.. In downtown Orlando, PCL Construction expects to finish work in July on Citi Tower, a 25-story luxury apartment tower in south Lake Eola area. And completion of the 22-story Modera Central apartment building, off Rosalind Avenue, is expected in the fall of 2018. Granade said he expects to see some "big" sales of downtown Orlando apartment projects in 2017, following sales in recent years for The Ivy Residences and SteelHouse complexes. Most of Central Florida's office growth slated for this year will be in the suburbs and much of that is speculative. In south Orlando, Kirkman Pointe II office midrise is slated for completion with 135,000 square feet of office space by the end of the year. In Lake Mary, Edison at Primera is expected to bring 216,141 square feet of office space by December. "These two developments are being built with no preleasing, and will be a key indicator for tenant demand, especially in two of the most popular office submarkets, Lake Mary and Southwest," reads a report from JLL. Lake Mary City Planner Steve Noto said several office projects are wrapping up off Rinehart Road. And near the new Verizon quarters at Heathrow's Central Park, construction this year will focus on smaller office buildings near apartments, coffee shops and dining. "It's become a nice little synergy center," Noto said. Shipley Hall, managing director of Cousins Properties Inc., said the suburban push reflects less expensive land without the need for parking garages. Downtown Orlando is unlikely to see a new office tower until Class A rents increase from $30 a square foot to $34 or $35 a square foot, he added. "The numbers for that right now don't make sense," said Hall, whose company holds Bank of America Center, Citrus Center and One Orlando Centre all in downtown. For now, building owners are renovating and polishing up common areas, fitness centers and other amenities. With a new director now in place at the Orlando Economic Development Commission, expectations will rise for new companies to locate in downtown, Hall added. Steve Garrity, vice president of Highwoods Properties in Orlando, said his company continues to eye prospects for a downtown Orlando tower that would be called Capital Plaza Three on Pine Street. Rental rates are increasing and vacancy rates for Class A space hover at 10 percent. The market still has some large available office chunks to meet the needs of new and expanding companies, he added. And downtown's growing entertainment and residential options continue to make it attractive. "The bad news is that construction costs continue to escalate," Garrity said, citing estimates of those costs growing by as much as 1 percent a month. Even if developers launched a new tower in 2017, he added, it would take two years to make it a reality. Central Florida's longtime wheelhouse of consumer spending — shopping malls — are expected to further give way this year to the rise of "lifestyle centers," which have a greater share of eateries, fitness centers, health care and services than traditional malls. "Call these lifestyle centers what you wish. They are the obvious response to the troubled mall model which focuses on the department stores as the anchor to draw traffic," said Owen Beitsch, senior director for Community Solutions Group. "In effect, these new properties fulfill the purpose of the traditional town center and the architecture often invokes the feel of small urban space." At one of the region's fastest-growing developments, Lake Nona, the 2017 calendar calls for completion of hotels, retail centers, and apartments. Developers say the projects follow a trend of opening in phases rather than all at once. "Trying to build a smaller bite and do it well is better than the construction savings you get by doing it all at once," said Jim Zboril, president of Tavistock Development Company, developer of Lake Nona. In 2017, Tavistock plans to lease and construct the next phase of Lake Nona Landing, which is off Narcoossee Road on the eastern side of Lake Nona and home to a Sam's Club and Wal-Mart Supercenter that both open this month. On the western edge of Lake Nona, the developer expects to start work during the next month on a Publix-anchored center with a moderately priced hotel near Boggy Creek Road and Lake Nona Boulevard. Lake Nona's retail centerpiece, an open-air town center developed in partnership with Steiner + Associates, moves forward this year with plans for another hotel, cinema, bowling, restaurants, a brewery, fitness center and possibly home-goods stores. A four-story office building in the town center is also expected to get underway there this year and add 150,000 square feet to the mix. A third hotel/resort is emerging at Lake Nona next to the USTA's new national campus. And the Ariel Apartments are being built with 348 units at the community. mshanklin@orlandosentinel.com or 407-420-5538 3 things you'll see •What: Citi Tower, a 25-story luxury apartment tower •Where: Downtown Orlando's south Lake Eola area — •What: Edison at Primera office complex •Where: Lake Mary — •What: Ariel Apartments, 348 units •Where: Lake Nona Privacy Policy Copyright © 2017, Orlando Sentinel Commercial Real Estate Real Estate Publix Super Markets Inc.

An arrest does not constitute a finding of guilt. Burr Ridge Alcohol Amanda M. Farrell, 25, of the 200 block of West 59th Street, Hinsdale, was charged with driving under the influence of alcohol on the 500 block of Village Center Drive, at 4:22 a.m. Jan. 15. Fraud A resident reported Jan. 14 he was scammed out of $10,000 by a telephone call from a woman who claimed to be his niece. She told him she had been arrested for drunken driving in Las Vegas, and needed $10,000. A man then got on the line and said he was an attorney. He told the resident to take care of the matter, he should buy $10,000 worth of Target gift cards and wait for a return call. The victim purchased the gift cards at Target, and then told the serial numbers on the card to the man pretending to be the attorney when he called back. Property damage A woman reported she saw a black Honda Pilot strike the mirror of a white Hyundai Sonata at Loyola Medical Center, at 6800 Frontage Road, at about 2:35 p.m. Jan. 19.

Brandon Adams, 19, of the 6100 block of Pershing, Downers Grove, was charged Jan. 7 with possession of a controlled substance for having Xanax without a prescription for the medication. Adams was in a vehicle with two other people that an officer saw parked in Lindenwood Park, at 7909 Cass Ave. Michael Mason, 20, of the 1100 block of Chalet Drive, Darien, who was also in the vehicle, was charged with possession of marijuana and underage possession of alcohol.

Crunch Network Venture capital in 2017 is when the rubber hits the road for returns Posted Jan 18, 2017 by Elizabeth “Beezer” Clarkson (@Beezer232) 0 SHARES Next Story Motive Partners, a new London/NYC fintech VC, is raising a $150M fund Elizabeth “Beezer” Clarkson Crunch Network Contributor Elizabeth “Beezer” Clarkson is managing director of Sapphire Ventures. More posts by this contributor: Why founders should care where their VCs get their money Dear VCs, there’s something you need to know about raising funds this year How to join the network In the United States, VC funds raised a whopping $40.6 billion in 2016[1]. It was the largest year for VC fundraising since 2000 when the venture industry raked in a jaw dropping $101.4 billion[1]. Yet the 2016 exit market was a mixed bag. Despite many forecasting (hoping?) that herds of unicorns would enter the public market in 2016, the IPO market was lackluster at best. There were only 31 U.S. VC-backed IPOs, down from 76 in 2015 and 121 in 2014[2] (by far the highest number of offerings in recent history). For first time since 2008, not a single IPO in 2016 saw more than $250 million raised, and only four offerings raised more than $100 million[1]. For the IT sector specifically, there were only 14 tech IPOs in 2016, down from 19 in 2015[1]. To say that the VC-backed IPO market slowed over the past two years would be an understatement. What drove this? The IPO market was not uniformly shut. Rather we believe some private VC- backed companies shied away from going public for fear of a chilly reception. The market went from valuing growth to looking for sustainable business metrics, which not all VC-backed companies felt that they had to get the valuations they wanted. M&A activity in tech, on the other hand, dwarfed IPO returns due to multiple mega deals thanks to PE and strategic investors. In 2016, of the 513 VC-backed tech exits in the United States, 499 were M&A events. These M&A exits represent $56.7 billion, versus the mere $9.6 billion exit value from the year’s 14 tech IPOs. [1] So, what does all of this then mean for 2017? Less money overall will be raised by venture funds this year than in 2016 Ok, I admit this one is a bit of a gimme given the $40.6 billion of capital raised in the United States combined with the big league names that closed new “mega” funds (funds of over $500 million) in 2016 – 24 in total, including Accel, Andreessen Horowitz, Battery Ventures, Founders Fund, General Catalyst, Greylock, Kleiner Perkins Caufied & Byers, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Norwest, Sapphire Ventures, Spark Capital, TCV, Thrive Capital, and the list goes on[1]. A number of notable VC names did not raise in 2016 and could raise 2017 (e.g., Benchmark, CRV, NEA and Sequoia among others). Notwithstanding this it’s hard to see how this year could repeat the total volume of dollars raised in 2016. There simply aren’t enough established brand names still on deck to raise large funds and it is very very hard for first time funds to raise a mega fund. Some investors think 2017 could harken back to the old days when the industry raised as little as $15 billion. For those keeping track we haven’t seen a figure like that since 2009 and 2010 when $16 billion and $13 billion were raised respectively.  Fundraising will still be a game of haves and have-nots And the haves in 2016 will be those VCs that have had realized exits. Given last year’s tepid exit market and the rise of down to flat rounds in the private market, LPs will be watching the public stock markets this year with great interest. LPs will increasingly insist on realized returns (aka exits) to differentiate between the haves and have nots. Raising funds based on unrealized returns was fairly commonplace in 2016. This might not be sufficient going forward in 2017 and even tougher for funds coming back in 2018. More first-time funds will be raised 2016 hit an historic low, with only 42 first-time funds that closed, compared to 94 in 2015[1]. Fundraising can also take a while; especially for new(er) managers it can take anywhere from 12 to 24+ months before a close. All signs point to a backlog. Thus, I expect the number of first-time funds to go up in 2017 as managers who started raising in 2016, and a handful of those beginning to raise this year, will close their funds in the next 12 months. That said, I don’t anticipate 2017 to return to the halcyon days of 2014 when 120 first-time funds were raised. There is a notable noise to signal challenge for LPs given the hundreds of microfunds raised over the past few years coupled with LPs’ desire to see how the fund managers they have backed in the past few years mature before adding new funds to their respective portfolios.    Buckle up, valuations will be a bumpy ride Photo courtesy of Flickr/Nick Lee   Many startups raised toward the end of 2015 when fundraising was still heavily focused on “growth” versus “metrics”. Therefore, they didn’t need to come back for more capital in 2016. But they will this year, and what sort of reception should they expect? Like most things in life (sigh), it’ll depend on who you are. On the supply side, there’s a lot of money sitting in venture funds waiting to be invested. A lot. Some funds raised in 2016 have yet to start investing. Plus many funds that were actively investing in 2016 slowed their pacing meaning this year they’ll be looking to put their money to work. That said, if the exit market remains tepid and interest rates rise, then later-stage and cross-over investors that supported the “private IPO” market will continue to be motivated to take their toys and go elsewhere. This could keep the pressure on valuations and venture investors who are hunting for companies hitting milestones/metrics. On the flip side, if the exit market opens up (which everyone I’ve spoken to fervently hopes it will) and IPOs kick off again, then VCs who are sitting on an abundance of capital will all be eager to invest their dollars. And this could cause bidding wars and push valuations up. The net-net? Expect continued high valuations for the best assets – how high will depend on how frothy the market becomes. For some second-tier assets, we foresee continued valuation pressure leading to continued down or flat rounds along with more recaps unless there is a significant positive change in the exit markets.  M&A exits will keep climbing both in volume and value For tech companies looking to exit the private market, the prospect of getting acquired may well be more promising than going public (and trading low) or raising a down round. With record amounts of cash on corporate balance sheets (potentially even more if corporations are motivated to repatriate off shore funds by the incoming administration) and significant dry powder in PE funds, there are lots of reasons to believe both corporations and PE shops will continue to acquire IT assets. Moreover, we believe non-traditional buyers will keep jumping into the game of acquiring mature startups in hopes of getting an edge on innovation (e.g. Walmart, GM, Unilever). In fact, at the end of 2016, non-tech acquirers became more common than tech companies in deals for $1 billion+ startups. All this to say, there’s lots of interest and supply for tech M&A – which is never a bad thing. Lastly we are keeping our eye on secondary sales If there is insufficient liquidity in 2017, met by a growing demand for exits to lay the groundwork for future venture fund fundraising, then stay tuned for a growing secondary market with private equity and dedicated secondary funds as willing buyers. The secondary market has already become a new reality for entrepreneurs, and we believe it will become so for venture funds as well.
