This post is sponsored by Mamma Chia.  Thank you for supporting the companies that make this site possible!  I am always on the hunt for great post-workout snacks that can keep me fueled throughout the day.  Today I wanted to share with you how to make two delicious smoothie bowls and I am pairing them with a fun new drink from Mamma Chia, called Chia Energy Beverages,  that you can now find on Walmart shelves.  Doesn’t that sound like a delicious pairing? I always struggle with finding new things at the store so, in case you are on the hunt, I wanted to show you where you can find them at Walmart. These drinks can be found in the produce section at the front of the store.  Our drinks were on full display on the top shelves and come in 4 flavors: Grape Power, Cherry Charge, Blackberry Blast, & Raspberry Razz. These drinks are the first beverage that combine chia with the energy of guayusa. For those of us with a coffee addiction (ahem!), these are a great way to get energy for the day without that caffeine crash. Caffeine crashes are THE WORST. As you know, I have been struggling with my health and I am really committed to eating better so that I can improve how I feel. The founder of Mamma Chia, Janie Hoffman, was also struggling with many debilitating autoimmune disorders and found a great deal of relief from adding chia into her diet. Her mission was to share that gift with others so that they can experience the health benefits too. I also love that the company donates a portion of their proceeds to support farmers, community groups, & organizations that build healthy, local food systems.  It makes you feel doubly good about your purchase! Today I thought I would incorporate the power of chia, not only in our drink, but as a topping in a healthy smoothie bowl. Chia is actually considered a superfood because chia seeds are rich in omega-3’s, fiber, protein, and essential vitamins and minerals. They also help you to sustain energy levels naturally while helping you stay fuller longer. Today we are topping our smoothie bowls with chia. If you haven’t had a smoothie bowl before, you are in for a treat.  I understand that many fancy-schmancy breakfast joints serve these now. How lucky are you that you can save some money and make these at home for a fraction of the cost? Let me share two recipes for smoothie bowsl with you and don’t forget to stick around to the bottom of this post for our giveaway with Mamma Chia- yay!  The idea is to make the smoothie thicker (make sure you have a powerful blender for this one) by using less liquid to create a thicker consistency. The fun part is the layering of delicious additions on top. On this Chocolate Cherry Bowl, I have topped it with fresh raspberries, toasted coconut, & more chia. Try any combination of flavors you like though!

I still wanted some of the chocolate flavor in this one so I topped it with a chocolate granola, and chia.  The vibrant hue from the raspberries in this one make such a pretty bowl, don’t they?

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Terrence McCoy September 17 Follow @terrence_mccoy Jim Cooley carries his AR-15 semiautomatic rifle into his home after getting it repaired in Winder, Ga. Cooley, who also owns a 9mm handgun, almost never leaves his home unarmed. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) WINDER, Ga. —All Jim Cooley wants to do is buy some soda. “You want to come to Walmart?” he asks his wife. “No,” Maria says. “Pretty please?” Jim asks. “I’m not going to sit there and have the police called on you. I mean, I don’t want to see that crap,” Maria says, knowing what a trip to Walmart means. She knows her 51-year-old husband has two guns inside the house, and this afternoon it won’t be the 9mm, which he straps on with a round in the chamber when grabbing lunch at his favorite fast-food restaurant or visiting a friend’s auto shop. It’ll be the AR-15 semiautomatic rifle, which he brings when going somewhere he thinks is dangerous, like the Atlanta airport, where he’s taken it loaded with a 100-bullet drum, or Walmart, where he thinks crowds could pose easy targets for terrorists. In a country of relaxing gun laws where it’s now legal to open-carry in 45 states and there are 14.5 million carry permits, every day seems to bring a new version of what open carry can mean. In Kentucky, it’s now legal to open-carry in city buildings. In downtown Cleveland, people carried military-style rifles during the Republican National Convention. In Howell, Mich., last month, a father went openly armed to his child’s middle-school orientation. In Mississippi, it’s now legal to open-carry without a permit at all. And in Georgia, which has passed a “guns everywhere” bill and has issued nearly 1 million carry permits, Jim Cooley is staking out his version of what’s acceptable as he keeps pleading with his wife. “I got to get soda.” Maria sighs. She worked the night before assembling air-conditioner compressors at a nearby factory, and in a few hours, she knows she’ll have to leave for another third shift. “Yeah,” she says, giving in. “I might as well get this travesty out of the way.” “What travesty?” “You carrying a big ol’ rifle in the store, scaring the hell out of all the Walmart shoppers.” “There’s no difference between carrying a rifle and carrying a handgun,” he says. “You tried that last time, remember?” Maria says, stepping into a pair of flip-flops and running her fingers through her hair. “And what happened? Barrow County sheriffs. Three or four of them.” “They can’t tell me what and what not to carry,” Jim says. “You know I wouldn’t listen to them anyway.” “Well, you go one way in the store; I’ll go the other,” Maria says. “Then when they say, ‘Ma’am, do you know this person?’ I’ll say, ‘No, I’ve never seen him before in my life.’ ” He places a lit cigarette into an ashtray, walks into his bedroom, reaches behind its door, picks up the AR-15, snaps in a magazine with 15 rounds, and slings the rifle around his left shoulder so it rests against his torso. “Ready?” he asks. “Yeah,” she says, grabbing her purse and following her husband out the door for an afternoon trip to Walmart to buy soda. *** After performing errands, Jim Cooley smokes a cigarette while resting at his home in Winder. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) The gun Jim Cooley carries is the ATI Omni-Hybrid Maxx AR-15 semiautomatic rifle. It cost him $579.99. It weighs 6.25 pounds, is 35 inches long, and fires bullets as fast as the trigger can be pulled, and, as Jim has learned, fits nicely between the front seats of a white minivan with peeling paint on the front and a bumper sticker on the back that says, “I ♥ Law.” Jim goes everywhere now with a gun — if not the AR-15, then his sidearm — and is so reliant on one being close by that it surprises him to think the majority of his life was lived otherwise. He was raised in a working-class family in Chicago, where he can’t imagine living now because of its strict gun laws. But they didn’t bother him then. He didn’t hunt. He didn’t fear for his safety. If his dad had a gun, no one knew. He grew up without a gun, went to church without a gun, married Maria without a gun, began raising two children without a gun, and settled into a life that felt as safe as it was dependable. But then it began unraveling, starting when he was fired from a trucking job days after telling Maria, who was pregnant with their first child, to quit her job and focus on the baby, that he could support them both. Their first bankruptcy filing wasn’t far behind, then the second, and the third, and then they were moving to Florida, where Maria had family and where Jim got a job with a grocery chain. It transferred him to Winder, and he moved the family into a middle-class neighborhood struggling with crime and drugs. Jim now steers past the house of a neighbor who sold him his first gun — a .380 semiautomatic for $100 — so he could protect his family from that crime, then past Winder’s only gun shop where he took his dad so he could buy a gun, too. He lights a cigarette, feels the breeze from an open window because the air conditioner is broken, and takes a sip of soda from a big mug that says Athens Regional Medical Center. It’s a memento of sorts from the day in late 2008 when he emerged from that hospital with three stents in his heart, debts worth $41,052.51 and a dawning realization he was now disabled, broke and would never work again. After the heart attack, he lost most of the circulation in his legs, received three more stents and started using an electric scooter whenever he had to walk long distances. He told Maria he was all used up, a drag on the family. She should think about leaving him. But she wouldn’t, even after the hospital sued him for unpaid medical bills, even after he was arrested when he carried his .380 outside a school board meeting, even after he came home one day with an AR-15. He shot it at a nearby firing range and, feeling a sense of control that had gone missing in his life, told Maria he could now keep the family safe. She now sits at his side, as always, in the passenger seat. At first, she didn’t understand the changes she saw in the man she married 24 years ago. Why did he suddenly want a gun when he never mentioned one before? Why did he want her to get one, too? Why did he put two four-inch knives inside the car’s ­passenger-side door? And why all the security cameras? Maria glances at a small screen beneath the rearview mirror: It shows feeds from surveillance cameras affixed inside the car that start recording when someone turns the ignition. Cooley drives his van, which is equipped with five security cameras, to a grocery store in Winder. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) Cooley, 51, looks up videos of an anti-Muslim protest at his home in Winder. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) But Maria went along with all of it. She bought a .380 semi­automatic and has gotten used to taking it with her wherever she goes. She got used to the cameras, too, including the seven Jim placed around the house’s perimeter. She began to understand why he was so concerned about crime, about terrorists, about the need to protect their family because they couldn’t count on the government to do it for them. Last year, when he showed her his new AR-15 and asked her to shoot it, she did, feeling intimidated afterward. But then she did it again. And when he started bringing the rifle not just to the range, but to Atlanta, to the airport, inside Walmart, she eventually went along with that, too. So much of her life involves accommodating him now, including just before they left for Walmart and he asked her to send a Facebook message to a local deputy about his plans. “What do you want me to tell him?” Maria had asked. “Say, ‘Hey, buddy, I’m going to Walmart, and I’m going to have my AR with me, so if any call comes over the radio, you know it’s me,” Jim told her. Maria sat at a laptop in a bedroom cluttered with stacks of documents, some of which detailed foreclosure proceedings against the house, and saw the browser had 35 tabs open. One was a YouTube video of something called “Police State 101.” Another showed the dictionary definition of the word “law.” Another was a fringe website her husband classifies as “underground,” the sort he started visiting more frequently after he joined a Georgia militia in late 2014 and decided it was up to him to protect his family from foreign and government threats. She messaged the deputy, then looked at Jim’s Facebook page. It bore pictures of her husband carrying guns and posts about a country dissolving into chaos and videos about people stopping intruders with guns, people killing burglars with guns, people shooting big guns, small guns, all kinds of guns, that he watches late into the night. She came back to the kitchen table, where Jim sat and smoked. “At least I notified the sheriff’s department ahead of time,” he said. He looked at Maria. “Come on, come to Walmart with me,” he said. “I got to get soda.” So she went along with that, too, and now here she is, pulling into a parking spot outside Walmart, and her husband is reaching for an AR-15 that he tells her sometimes he would have no problem using against a thief breaking into their house, or a violent protester in the streets of Milwaukee, or a terrorist in Syria, or, if necessary, even a stray dog on their lawn. *** Cooley poses for a portrait with his AR-15 semiautomatic rifle at his home in Winder. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) The Walmart Supercenter is outside of downtown Winder, next to the Subway, the Great Clips, the GameStop, and buffered by a parking lot that can easily fit hundreds of cars, but is rarely more than half-full on weekdays. There are two entrances. One is beside the landscaping section and says “Home and Garden” above the doorway. The other, which Jim now walks through, leads to another Subway, this one just inside the supercenter. As Maria goes ahead, Jim veers to the right, where he climbs into a complimentary electric scooter, repositions his AR-15 so its barrel points toward the scuffed vinyl floor, and rolls into the store. “Hey, Maria,” he calls when catching up to her. “Do we need any lunch meat?” “I’ll go get some salami,” she says. “All right,” he says, now alone, and accelerates the scooter deeper into the store, crossing into the grocery section. Two middle-aged women stand beside a refrigerator, talking. One of them looks at Jim, sees the gun around his neck and goes silent. The other woman turns, and when she sees the gun, her expression freezes, too. But it’s not the fearful looks that Jim notices as he rolls past. It’s a nearby sale. “Eighty-eight cents for a loaf,” he says and keeps moving toward the back of the store. Not everyone sees his AR-15, which is partially obscured by the cart. One man walks past without a second look. So does a woman, making her way into the clothing section. One couple give Jim wide berth, their eyes on his scooter and, briefly, his gun. And then Jim gets where he’s going — the soda aisle — and sees what he’s looking for. He reaches out and, grunting, pulls free a 24-pack of Diet Dr. Thunder. Trying not to jostle the AR-15, he leans forward and, twisting awkwardly, drops the box into the scooter’s front cart, accidentally tearing it open. “They don’t make these things like they used to,” he says quietly and grabs another 24-pack of Diet Dr. Thunder, placing this one inside the cart more gently. In search of Maria, he continues into the dairy section, where he wheels past a father and his young daughter who stares at his rifle, into aisle 9, where he puts a large can of Great Value Classic Roast Coffee into his cart, and finally back to the front of the supercenter, where he sees Maria ordering salami. She takes the soda and coffee out of his cart and places it in her own. She gestures at a nearby cheesecake. “They got strawberry swirl,” she says. He is leaning forward. The muzzle of the loaded gun is pressing against his shoe. Now it’s sliding under his shoelaces. “Give me the strawberry swirl,” he says, and as Maria heads toward the checkout line with the cheesecake, the salami, the coffee and the soda, he straightens up and the muzzle slides free of his shoe. He steers toward the front doors, parks the scooter, slowly stands and walks outside, and that’s when a group of employees standing just outside the entrance notices the gun. “Is that what I see?” one will later recall saying. “What do we do if he comes in the store?” “If someone feels uncomfortable, what can we do?” They continue staring as Jim walks into the parking lot toward the car. “You know my grandfather was murdered, right?” one of the employees says, and as they launch into a discussion of a robbery and shooting that happened in 1973, they are in the midst of a late summer afternoon in 2016 with its own set of shootings. In California, by the end of this day, a 61-year-old man will have been shot to death at a carwash. In Virginia, an intruder will have burst into a home and killed a 24-year-old man inside. In Missouri, a woman will have shot and killed a man she said was chasing her. And meanwhile, in Georgia, Jim is braking hard on the ride home, causing his AR-15 to topple forward. “Can you hold onto that for me, please?” he asks Maria. “Yeah,” she says, putting the gun back where it was, and without further incident they continue on their way home, where Jim puts away his AR-15, sits down at the kitchen table and takes a drink of Diet Dr. Thunder. Here’s what you need to know about the guns some are calling “the gold standard for mass murder,” after Orlando shooter Omar Mateen used the assault-style rifle Sig Sauer MCX to kill at least 49 people.

From interviews expressing his feelings of other talent, to the debacle against Booker T on an episode of Raw, Bagwell is viewed by many as one of the most notorious people in pro wrestling. In a recent interview on the Pancakes and Powerslams Show, he lived up to his celebrity status in many ways.  While he has shared his view on the match with Booker T on many occasions, Bagwell was asked about his short-lived career in TNA, appearing in 2002, 2003, and 2006. During his one-off appearance in 2006, he had the option to become Sting's tag team partner during an angle. Instead, the spot was given to Samoa Joe. Bagwell did not agree with this decision, as he does not believe that Joe is a big draw.  "Samoa Joe, to me, I've never got that," Bagwell expressed. "I know he's very popular. I know he's very good in the ring, I think he's a great wrestler, I like to watch him. But when you've got a chance to do a storyline, to the world of wrestling fans, who's going to be Sting's tag team partner, and the options are Lex Luger, Marcus Bagwell, and Samoa Joe. I mean, who in the heck is Samoa Joe? And Luger wasn't fit enough, so I fit the part perfectly." He added, "I really don't know where [TNA] were going with that, except maybe a push for Samoa Joe? Me and Samoa Joe haven't spoke 10 words together. He was on one independent show with me in Cleveland, and he got mad because I was in the main event and he wasn't. To me, Samoa Joe is a fat, out of shape guy who looks like he should not be in a wrestling ring, and I've not heard or seen anybody ever draw a dollar with him."  Bagwell would also state that CM Punk ultimately was not over, because he does not pass the "Walmart Test". Bagwell stated, "Here's how I look at it. If I was a promoter like Vince McMahon or Ted Turner, if I was trying to make money in the wrestling industry, I would judge it by having a person walk through Walmart. If CM Punk walked through Walmart even as popular as he is, he's not going to get noticed as much as Hulk Hogan walking through Walmart. The reason why I say Walmart, is [because] that is our fanbase."  Regarding his debut at UFC 203, he added, "He was able to stay over for a year and not have a fight, and then you go out and take such a big fight and get beat up. I mean, brother, that leaves not a dent, not a scratch, that leaves a scar. I'm not sure that can be fixed. So, it was a bad, bad decision, but whoever his manager is to keep his name getting said without having a fight, weighing a buck fifty; thin as a rail, he doesn't look like a tough guy, I heard some things but he don't look it. But to be able to get talked about on a pretty regular basis, bravo [claps]! But when you go out and get beat up real bad, that is really bad. I was rooting for him, because it makes us all look good. We're all pro wrestlers. But, instead, he goes out there and gets his brain beaten out." Last month, it was revealed that Bagwell was suing WWE for royalties for being used on the WWE Network without being compensated. Bagwell gave some very interesting, and rational, details of why he decided to sue the company. He explained, "I was sitting at home one day, and - keep in mind, I was called up about the concussion lawsuit going on, you know how the boys are, there's a lot of trash in this business; a lot of it - I remember me and Lex [Luger] talking about it like come on man, really? No one made me do anything, it was a scam, reaching out for things. It's ridiculous. Well, I've probably over the years had three or four or five of those kind of phone calls, where somebody saw a loophole, trying to get everybody together to go after Vince, and everytime I'm like, you gotta be kidding me. One day I get a call, about a year ago, probably, from a lawyer, super great guy, his name is Matthew Peterson, and he talks to me for a minute and says, 'I'm doing a thing where I'm checking on independent contracts; I know a lot about WCW’. He made me give him my resume over the phone. And it was a good one. I liked the way he spoke, I liked the way he talked, he said, 'basically, what I do is I look at your contract, and I see if you felt like you've been mistreated at all; and if you do, we look at some openings and see how you feel about that.' I said, I'll send you a copy of my contract today so you can look at it and see what you think! So, I sent him my contract, and I realize that in a class action lawsuit, there's a bunch of people always. Well, there aren't a whole lot of people who worked for the WCW, WWF, and WWE, and I fall in that real small group of names that did that. So, maybe that's why I thought this one was intriguing at first. I said that only thing I'm upset about, is every single week, I hear somebody say, 'you were on WWE, the nWo part is on now, and you beat up Scotty Riggs'. The first time I heard that, no big deal, didn't think anything about it. All of a sudden, I'm hearing 2 Cold Scorpio, Scotty Riggs, Nasty Boys. So me and this lawyer started talking, and he sees that they didn't - through their wording - fire me. They released me. I realized that I wasn't getting any checks anymore. Every once in a while I would get a 100 dollar check, a 200 dollar check here and there, but nothing was ever WWE Network. It was always some kind of nWo tape that I was on, or t-shirts. And the last thing I got from them, and that's what got me on this, was probably 5,6,7 years ago; and it was probably a hundred bucks. All of a sudden, I'm hearing the Network, Network, Network, and I'm always on it. And little kids come up to me and say, 'Yeah I saw you! My daddy watched you on TV!' So, me and the lawyer started talking, and sure enough, he finds a loophole where they owe me a breakdown that they have to pay me a certain amount of money quarterly. And that's all it basically boils down to."  Bagwell also explained one way that WWE would try to get out of the current lawsuit, which is being hired back by the company. While he stated that he would be open to returning, WWE would never give him that opportunity again.  For latest WWE News, live coverage and rumours visit our Sportskeeda WWE section.

Cortland County Sheriff's deputies responded at 9:46 p.m. Thursday for the reported robbery outside the Walmart store on Bennie Road in Cortlandville. The 19-year-old victim told deputies he was walking to work at the store when he was struck in the head by two people, police said. According to police, the victim lost consciousness and awoke to feel one of the assailants trying to take his cellphone from his back pocket. Deputies received a description of the suspects from the victim, and both suspects were taken into custody in the area a short time later. One suspect, a 17-year-old boy, was charged with felony counts of second-degree robbery and fourth-degree conspiracy, along with a misdemeanor count of petit larceny and a second-degree harassment violation. Due to his age, police did not identify the 17-year-old. A second suspect, 18-year-old Dameian J. Marlow, of Onondaga Avenue in Syracuse, also was charged with felony second-degree robbery and fourth-degree conspiracy counts, as well as petit larceny and harassment. Police say both teenagers were arraigned in Cortlandville Town Court and sent to the Cortland County jail with bail set at $10,000 cash or $20,000 bond, to await further court action. Felony DWI charges A Johnson City man has been charged with felony drunken driving after a previous DWI conviction within the past decade, police said. Joel L. Wilkerson, 53, was arrested at 7:12 p.m. Sept. 10 after a traffic stop for unlicensed driving on Main Street in Johnson City, village police said. The officer knew Wilkerson did not have a driver's license due to multiple suspensions, according to police. Three female passengers, all under the age of 15, were in the vehicle while Wilkerson was operating while intoxicated, police said. Wilkerson was charged with felony counts of driving while intoxicated, driving with a blood alcohol content of 0.08 percent or greater, aggravated DWI, aggravated DWI with a blood alcohol content of 0.18 percent or greater, and first-degree aggravated unlicensed operation. He also was charged with misdemeanor counts of aggravated unlicensed operation, operating a vehicle without an interlock device, and an unlicensed operation traffic infraction. Police say Wilkerson was released to appear in Johnson City Village Court. Dispute gets violent A Freeville man is accused of punching and kicking another person, as well as preventing the victim from calling 911, state police said. Troopers arrested Samuel Crowe, 54, on Thursday after responding to a dispute on Ringwood Road in Dryden. Investigators say a verbal dispute took place, and Crowe punched and kicked the victim. Crowe was charged with a misdemeanor count of fourth-degree criminal mischief and a second-degree harassment violation. He was arraigned in Dryden Town Court and sent to the Tompkins County jail with bail set at $1,000 cash or $5,000 bond.

In a post on Twitter, the Kearny Police Department said only that there was a "Non-fatal police-involved shooting at Walmart this morning. All suspects were quickly apprehended. Officer treated and released." There is no information at this time on the charges filed against those arrested, nor is there information of the nature of the officer's injuries and how they were sustained. "Our hearts are with the injured police officer as he recovers and we're working with detectives as they sort through their investigation," said Walmart corporate spokeswoman Leslee Wright in an email earlier today.   Officers from the Kearny Police Department and the Hudson County Prosecutor's Office responded to Walmart after the shots were fired. Kearny police have been referring all questions to the Prosecutor's Office and earlier today a spokesman for the HCPO said he had no comment.  Most Read Active Discussions nj.com About Us About NJ.com Advertise with us Contact Us Visit OMJ.com Frequently Asked Questions Jobs at NJ Advance Media Newsletters RSS feeds More on NJ.com Interact Weather Site map Claim your free business listing Sponsor Content Search Place an ad Sell your car Sell/rent your home Post a job Post a free classified ad Apartments & rentals NJ.com Sections N.J.

(Photo: Mickey Shuey/Palladium-Item)Buy Photo 11 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE During one of its longest meetings in recent memory, the board of zoning appeals last week granted Premier Toyota of Richmond permission to use Wal-Mart's parking lot to display cars for a period of 10 days next May. The board spent more than 1½ hours discussing and entertaining motions for the request, made by Wal-Mart on behalf of the car dealership, which sought to use the lot for a Memorial Day sale as a location for customers to look at, but not purchase, vehicles. The sale also would include a small information and weather tent, from which representatives would distribute water to visitors. Any automotive purchases still would be conducted at the dealership — which sits about 2 miles east of Wal-Mart — according to the request filed by the companies. Each board member asked several questions of Toyota and Wal-Mart representatives present at the meeting. Generally, the questions focused on the impact the decision could have on the surrounding businesses and homes, the reasons why Toyota couldn't conduct the sale on its own property, and the potential precedent that could be set by approving the request. Toyota officials argued use of the lot would give them the ability to connect with more people and allow the dealership to display several dozen more cars than it could otherwise. "For us, it was a straightforward issue, and we thought it was a (straightforward) request," said Al Bledsoe, a representative for Toyota, following the meeting. "If you look at other communities in the region, they generally are on board with requests of this nature because it brings in people from all over." The board's advisory panel didn't make a recommendation to approve the motion because in its fact-finding it determined approval could have a negative effect on the surrounding area. The panel noted five findings, three of which were counter to what Toyota had presented in its request. For that reason, the board was required to entertain motions on each fact presented by the panel and, when necessary, state a reason for why approval would be the proper decision. If the board had agreed to use the panel's findings, the request for the variance would have been dead. Board member Benny Young said his main concern was whether more car dealerships would be inclined to make similar requests. "With the approval of this motion, could (these sales) occur every day from now on?" he said. "That was a big question we had." Young ultimately asked the board to approve the motion for use of the lot, with a stipulation that the sale not last longer than 10 consecutive days and was limited to one instance. Young said it was one of the longest board meetings in which he has participated. "I've never had one quite like this," he said. "It was certainly a (long meeting)." "We had to do our due diligence on this and make sure we were making the right decision and presenting the appropriate arguments," Young said. "It was what was necessary." Bledsoe said he was happy the board approved the motion but was surprised by how long it took to go through the process. "I'm certainly happy the board approved it and we can move forward," he said. "It was just kind of staggering how long it took. But we are certainly appreciative that they're letting us move forward." In other business The board of zoning appeals also heard, and approved, three other variance requests during its September meeting. • The Kentucky Fried Chicken/Taco Bell at 1428 National Road W. requested permission for additional signs on its property to better direct customers to the fast-food restaurant. • The board heard requests to allow for a different parking setup at an in-development multiple-family residential structure on Winding Ridge Drive. Current ordinances require a certain amount of setback from the road for parking, which the developers of the property said would be a hardship to follow. • A request to allow a dry cleaning facility at 651 N.W. Fifth St. also was presented to the board. Dry cleaners have several toxic and flammable materials and liquids that call for additional zoning considerations. The board of zoning appeals next will meet on Oct. 20 in the city council chambers. To reach Palladium-Item business reporter Mickey Shuey, call (765) 973-4472.

Read today's eNewspaper News Maryland Harford County The Aegis Man dies of self-inflicted gunshot in Aberdeen Walmart parking lot Allan VoughtContact ReporterThe Aegis Police tried to negotiate with a suicidal man but it appears he was already dead Privacy Policy Police and crisis negotiators converged on the parking lot of the Aberdeen Walmart Thursday night after receiving a report of a man in a vehicle with a gun who was threatening to harm himself. After lengthy attempts at negotiating that received no response, police moved in on the vehicle and found the occupant, age 29, was already dead. The incident began when the Harford County Sheriff's Office received a mobile phone call from that came from a man, who said he lived in the Edgewood area and was threatening to kill himself with a handgun, Aberdeen Police Department spokesperson Det. Sgt. Will Reiber said. "The vehicle was located in the Walmart parking lot, which is how we [Aberdeen Police] got involved," Reiber said. Aberdeen Police officers responded to the Walmart, in the 600 block of Philadelphia Boulevard, at 7:50 p.m. Thursday and quickly located the vehicle. Death along I-95 in Abingdon Thursday night was no accident, investigators say ALLAN VOUGHT Woman's body was found in burning SUV near Route 24 interchange Woman's body was found in burning SUV near Route 24 interchange (ALLAN VOUGHT) "They tried to create a dialogue, but the man did not respond," Reiber said. Because officers had been notified the man was armed with a handgun and thus posed a potential threat to the safety of store patrons and others in the area, a perimeter was set up around the vehicle and the Harford County Crisis Negotiation Team was called, Reiber said. Additional attempts by negotiators to establish communication with the individual were not successful, Reiber said, and the Harford County Municipal SWAT team members approached the vehicle. They determined from looking from outside the vehicle that the man inside had sustained head trauma. Reiber said the officers gave immediate medical attention but the man was already deceased. Crime scene investigators determined the man sustained a single self-inflicted gunshot wound. His body was transported to the Office of the State Medical Examiner for further examination, police said.

Us Weekly reports Belinda Hankins sent her 13-year-old daughter Isabella into Walmart around 12:30am last Sunday while she waited in the car. What was supposed to be a quick trip turned into something much different. "THEYRE NOT HERRREEEEEE," Isabella texted her mom. After a lengthy hunt during which Hankins instructed Isabella to look near the "sex lube," Isabella found them "tucked away in a corner unlabelled." Time for a life lesson. "They labelled the tiny shelf of joint braces but not the massive aisle of stuff for your vagina?" Isabella texted. Her mom replied that they never do because "vaginas are SECRET" and "society is controlled by men, and they fear us because we are powerful." The rest of their conversation includes thoughts on why men are afraid of vaginas, a map to Walmart's "vagina zone," a reference to the the "vaj mobile," and a reminder to "SMASH THE PATRIARCHY." Hankins posted the whole conversation to her Facebook page, and it quickly went viral. While Refinery 29 reports Hankins' parenting has been questioned by trolls, Teen Vogue thanks the mother-daughter duo for being open about reproductive health and sharing some "top notch feminist theory." (After an Olympic loss, this swimmer dared mention her period.)

 Walmart is ramping up its battle with Visa BI Intelligence Sep. 16, 2016, 10:45 AM 1,421 facebook linkedin twitter email print BII See Also Vantiv has made a key acquisition Samsung Rewards could spur Samsung Pay adoption The American Express lawsuit could be headed back to court This story was delivered to BI Intelligence "Payments Briefing" subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here. In late October, Walmart Canada will stop accepting Visa cards at 16 more stores, all located in Manitoba. In July, Walmart Canada stopped accepting the cards in three Ontario stores, saying that high per-transaction fees assessed by Visa may have been impacting the retailer’s prices and ultimately its margins. The firm, which is reportedly in talks with Visa to reach a fee agreement, selected Manitoba because its stores were the “most ready” to stop accepting Visa, according to CBC, though the move could expand further to other stores in the future. The ban is likely low-risk for both Walmart and Visa, but could be symbolically impactful. In the US, most Walmart purchases are transacted via debit card — a dynamic that likely carries over to Canada. In the US, such a ban would be disastrous, since most debit cardholders use Visa cards, and would ultimately impact both Walmart’s business and Visa’s volume. But in Canada, the predominant debit network is Interac, not Visa, which means that the ban can symbolically stand while having a limited material impact on both parties involved. But Walmart’s willingness to follow through at a time when swipe fees are in the spotlight could signal to card networks that retailers aren’t backing down. Recently, several major merchants have taken legal action against card networks because of high or unfair swipe fees. And in the UK, a banking expert has filed a complaint on behalf of consumers because of inflated prices as a response to high swipe fees. Card networks have likely relied on the belief that major retailers wouldn’t limit access at risk of angering consumers, but Walmart’s hardline stance could make card networks take these complaints more seriously and ultimately lower fees down the line.  Fraud cost U.S. retailers approximately $32 billion in 2014, up from $23 billion just one year earlier. To solve the card fraud problem across in-store, online, and mobile payments, payment companies and merchants are implementing new payment protocols that could finally help mitigate fraud. John Heggestuen, senior research analyst for BI Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, has compiled a detailed report on payment security that looks at how the dynamics of fraud are shifting across in-store and online channels and explains the top new types of security that are gaining traction across each of these channels, including on Apple Pay. Here are some of the key takeaways from the report: EMV cards are being rolled out with an embedded microchip for added security. The microchip carries out real-time risk assessments on a person's card purchase activity based on the card user's profile. The chip also generates dynamic cryptograms when the card is inserted into a payment terminal. Because these cryptograms change with every purchase, it makes it difficult for fraudsters to make counterfeit cards that can be used for in-store transactions. To bolster security throughout the payments chain encryption of payments data is being widely implemented. Encryption degrades valuable data by using an algorithm to translate card numbers into new values. This makes it difficult for fraudsters to harvest the payments data for use in future transactions. Point-to-point encryption is the most tightly defined form of payments encryption. In this scheme, sensitive payment data is encrypted from the point of capture at the payments terminal all the way through to the gateway or acquirer. This makes it much more difficult for fraudsters to harvest usable data from transactions in stores and online. Tokenization increases the security of transactions made online and in stores. Tokenization schemes assign a random value to payment data, making it effectively impossible for hackers to access the sensitive data from the token itself. Tokens are often "multiuse," meaning merchants don't have to force consumers to re-enter their payment details. Apple Pay uses an emerging form of tokenization. 3D Secure is an imperfect answer to user authentication online. One difficulty in fighting online fraud is that it is hard to tell whether the person using card data is actually the cardholder. 3D Secure adds a level of user authentication by requiring the customer to enter a passcode or biometric data in addition to payment data to complete a transaction online. Merchants who implement 3D Secure risk higher shopping-cart abandonment. In full, the report: Assesses the fraud cost to US retailers and how that fraud is expected to shift in coming years Provides 5 high-level explanations of the top payment security protocols Includes 7 infographics illustrating what the transaction flow looks like when each type of security is implemented. Analyzes the strengths and weakness of each payment security protocol and the reasons why particular protocols are being put in place at different types of merchants.

Dress up an old sofa Give the couch new life by pulling a slipcover over its tired old self. Slipcovers run as low as $25 at Walmart. If you can't find a fitted slipcover that works on your sofa, don't worry. Done well, a loose fit is timeless. Check Overstock and elsewhere for machine-washable cotton duck covers in many colors. With any remaining cash, jazz up your new couch by making or buying an accent pillow or two. 6. Tackle carpet stains Sign up for the free Money Talks Newsletter Take a Saturday morning and give your carpets some TLC at virtually no cost. There are several methods described — along with some of the potential hazards — at The Carpet Buyers Handbook. For carpets stained beyond your powers of restoration, consider using a professional carpet cleaning service. Have only the most heavily trafficked room done if you need to keep costs below $50. When looking for a professional service, make sure you're comparing apples with apples: Some charge by the room, others by the square foot. 7. Make a faux tile kitchen backsplash This is more than a simple painting job. A painted kitchen backsplash mimics the contemporary look of narrow horizontal stone and glass tiles. The project requires a lot of preparatory taping. But, judging from instructions and photos at the Reality Daydream blog, it is worth the effort. 8. Reupholster an ottoman Grab a staple gun and a simple piece of furniture, like an ottoman, and give it new life. Brooke Ulrich, DIY blogger at All Things Thrifty, shows how to tackle reupholstery. Here's a quick video with a trick for removing old fabric from furniture, which she says is one of the hardest parts of the job. Shop for fabric and a piece of furniture with simple lines at the ReStore, a thrift shop, Craigslist or Freecycle. Or search online for "fabric outlet" and "discount upholstery fabric." Another source: Jo-Ann Fabrics' frequent sales, discounts and coupons allow for big savings. Shoppers who sign up at the site get more discounts. Find a store near you or shop online. 9. Rearrange bookshelves "Style" your bookshelves with artistic flare. Better Home & Gardens has inspiration and tips. This is a fun, creative project, so spend some time and enjoy it. Among BHG's tips: Treat each shelf as a display, and then stand back and make sure all shelves work well together. Position some items off-center on a shelf. Place some books in horizontal stacks and use the stacks as bookends for books shelved vertically. For a designer look, cover the inside of a bookcase with fabric or wallpaper. Don't pack treasures and collections on every shelf. Pieces of pottery make nice, solid bookends. Stack a pyramid of books and put one of your favorite objects atop the stack. Use bookshelves as a gallery for framed photos or art. 10. Upgrade cabinet hardware If your kitchen and bathroom look dated, and you can't replace the cabinets, replacing the cabinet hardware gives rooms a new look. Here are shopping tips: Remove one handle or drawer pull to see how many screws it uses and how far apart they should be. Your new hardware will need to have this same configuration. Before shopping, take stock of your room's style. To avoid being overwhelmed by all the options, first browse home decorating magazines to identify the look of the hardware you want, for example: Pulls or handles? Sleek and modern? Old world? Recycled and eclectic? When you have a rough idea of what to look for, do some price shopping online. Try Ikea, Overstock and local and chain hardware stores. But also do an online search for "cabinet hardware" to see what's available online. 11. Rearrange furniture Ask someone whose home styling skills you admire to help you see your home and possessions in a new light. Stay open to change and new ideas. Sign up for the free Money Talks Newsletter Last year I asked someone I know to spend an hour with me finding how to make better use of a difficult space in my home. She has a true genius for visualizing space. She spent two or three hours coming up with new configurations for my same old furnishings that somehow made the space roomier, more usable and much more attractive. 12. Brighten the entry Follow these three steps to revitalize the look of your home's entry with a little elbow grease and a can of exterior paint: Start by taking everything off the front porch or deck and scrubbing it from rafters to floorboards. Clean the front door and give it a new paint job. Consider a stylish color that complements your home's exterior, yet is a little brighter. Your local paint store will have paint chips and ideas. Browse Pinterest or Houzz for color schemes and inspiration. Replace or repair damaged screens or storm doors. Polish metal doorknobs and fixtures. 13. Install a front door kick plate A kick plate is a broad strip of polished metal used horizontally along the bottom edge of a front door to protect it from scratches, kicks and dog paws. Kick plates are decorative as well as functional. Brass is traditionally used, but popular finishes now include antique brass, pewter, antique bronze and black. Change your old kick plate for a new one, or install a kick plate if you haven't used one before. After choosing a metal finish you like, use the same finish on all of your exterior hardware. 14. Paint exterior shutters and trim A fresh coat of paint (or two) on shutters and trim provides a quick, easy shot in the arm for your home's exterior. Paint all the trim or just the window trim. And if you are short on time or materials, repaint only the front-facing trim. It's safest to use a color that's already part of your home's exterior color scheme. 15. Install new doorknobs Put attractive new knobs or handles on interior doors and closets. For family members who are aging, arthritic or disabled, make life easier by replacing knobs with easier-to-grasp door levers like these at Home Depot. 16. Make a new headboard Sign up for the free Money Talks Newsletter Craft a new headboard for your bed or refurbish your old one. If you scrounge for free and cheap materials, you can do it for less than $50. A few ideas: Try making a new headboard from recycled doors. Sunset magazine tells how to attach new upholstery fabric to an old headboard. DIY Network has 15 ideas and photos for upgrading headboards. Martha Stewart tells how to make a padded headboard in nine steps (with video) using a hollow-core door, batting and fabric. 17. Shine a new light Lighting plays an important role in home decor. Installing new lights, or even changing the wattage, can change the look and mood of a room. "After years of work, LED lighting companies have finally achieved their goal of producing a good replacement for the common 60-watt incandescent bulb," says MIT Technology Review's article, "How to Choose an LED Light Bulb." Some bulbs are rated to last 25,000 hours, or up to 25 years, depending on the use. The article tells how to choose among the various brightness options and select bulbs for shape, function, color and light quality. It says: For the consumer, the main benefits of LED fixtures are clear: They're energy-efficient, can last for more than 20 years and, in many cases, give off good light. The prices have gone down steadily as well, as the LED components have dropped in price and lighting companies introduce better designs. When investing in new LED bulbs, consider changing the fixture itself as well. Look for used fixtures online, at thrift shops and ReStores. For a fun project that delivers instant drama for less than $50, install flexible LED ribbon lighting atop or under cabinets. For less than $50, you can get, for example, an 8-foot length of Armacost RibbonFlex Pro RGB LED tape light. Armacost has installation instructions and project photos and ideas. Find how-to installation videos at YouTube. Sign up for the free Money Talks Newsletter 19. Give your home a deep cleaning If you're considering spending money on a shrink, first try using Oprah.com's checklist, timeline and instructions for deeply, thoroughly cleaning your home in eight hours. Oprah.com calls it "spring cleaning," but don't let that stop you from doing it now. The psychological benefits of a really clean home are immense, and you'll feel wonderfully virtuous for doing it. 20. Add container plants New plants dress up your home's porch and garden and give great curb appeal. You can start plants from seeds in spring or in a greenhouse. In autumn, dig a few of the more vigorous and prolific perennials from your garden or a friend's and install them in pots. Ivy, a pest in gardens, looks terrific trailing down sides of planters, for example. Your local garden store or nursery may have a half-price area from which it sells cast-offs. Often, watering and care is all they need. The Micro Gardener has loads of ideas and photos for garden containers made from furniture, kitchen equipment, bathroom fixtures, toys, baskets, boxes and even clothes and shoes for use as outdoor planters. Check out her vertical garden made from a hanging cloth shoe rack. 21. Install kitchen utility hooks For a quick kitchen upgrade that you'll enjoy daily, install a wall-mounted row of sturdy utility hooks. Use them for everything from dish towels and pot holders to utensils and measuring cups. You might even slip a recipe you're using into a plastic ring-binder sleeve, add a ring clip and hang it for ready access 22. Install new house numbers Sign up for the free Money Talks Newsletter Change your old house numbers. Find them with an online search, at hardware stores or shop for handmade numbers at Etsy. 23. Give light switch covers new life Here's how to give grimy old light switch covers new life: Toss them out and treat yourself to new ones. For a fun project, cover some of them with decoupage.

Scientists turn CO2 into rock – again Canada may get a national bird, but it's not who you think The trick to finding Black Friday bargains on Apple products is knowing where to look — and that's anywhere but the Apple Store.

Marcio Jose Sanchez/AP/File View Caption About video ads View Caption of Apple fans may be resigned to paying full price for their gadgets, but we'll certainly see Apple gear on sale this Black Friday season. The trick to finding these bargains is knowing where to look — and that's anywhere but the Apple Store. Last year, Apple reseller stores like Best Buy, B&H Photo, Target, and Walmart were the top places to find deals on iPads, iPhones, and even the Apple Watch. This year we expect more of the same, with electronics retailers making sharp cuts to select Apple products. Trust us, it's worth looking beyond Apple to get the best deals of the season. This year for our Black Friday predictions, we've created a "cheat sheet" with the top tips you need to know when shopping this season.

Photos of the Day Photos of the Day 11/18 The Cheat Sheet: Black Friday Apple Predictions Prices to Expect Apple Watch Series 2 for $350; Apple Watch Series 1 for $200 iPhone 7 for $549, or $99 down iPhone 6s for $349, or $1 down iPad Air 2 for $350; iPad mini 4 for $250 13" iPad Pro for $650, 10" iPad Pro for $550 11" MacBook Air for $700 21" iMac for $900 4 Quick Tips You Need to Know Don't expect any of these deals to appear at the Apple Store! Resellers will offer the best (and only) discounts. Older-generation iPhones will be heavily discounted thanks to the introduction of the iPhone 7. Be sure to check the memory when buying an iPhone 6s. Be careful when buying an Apple Watch; the original has a slower processor than the new "Series 1," but stores might not advertise that. Look to the iPad Air 2 for the deepest iPad discounts. Want more details on how, what, where, and when to buy Apple deals this Black Friday? Then check out our full analysis below. When to Shop Apple Deals Will Start Early and Stay Through Black Friday Technically, an Editors' Choice Apple deal could spring up at any point during the weeks of Black Friday and Cyber Monday. However, our research shows that you're more likely to encounter a top-shelf discount starting on Tuesday of Black Friday week, running through Black Friday itself. Before and after this period, the deals are fewer and further between. The reason is likely because Apple products are now used as doorbusters for big-box retailer ads. For the past few years, we've seen stores like Walmart, Target, and Best Buy dangle iPads and iPhones in front of salivating customers as a way to get people amped for the sales. We expect to see the same thing happen this year. What to Buy New Apple Products Mean New Price Points We've now got a new iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, which means list prices have been slashed for previous-generation products. Retailers will discount prices even further during holiday sales. In the past, we've seen older-gen Apple goods at 20% off during Black Friday — and sometimes even more. However, bear in mind that you won't find deals on every model (or even every color). The best deal will be on low-end models; look for bargains on the base models, usually 16GB iPhones and iPads, as well as the 11" MacBook Air and 21" iMac. The best Apple deals will be on the base models for previous-generation devices. But even brand-new models get discounted on Black Friday. In 2015, we saw discounts of up to $100 off on the latest iPhone, 5% off the then-new 13" iPad Pro, and as much as 15% off the original Apple Watch. If you're eager to pick up any new releases, you might hold off to see the holiday deals. Finally, bear in mind that the more aggressively priced deals are likely to be available in limited quantities, or be normally priced items bundled with a big gift card. The Faster Apple Watch Series 1 Could Drop to $200 The Apple Watch was updated in September, and while a new generation was announced (see below), the old generation was also updated with a new dual-core processor. This model is now being called Series 1, to differentiate it from the previous version with the slower processor. In the process, the Series 1 price was knocked to $269, which is a solid discount for an item that previously cost $349. Considering the discounts we've seen on the Apple Watch this year, we could see deals of up to 25% off on Series 1 models for Black Friday. We're predicting that the 38mm Sport will drop to $200, while the 42mm Sport could fall to $225. That said, it's possible that stores will treat these models like "brand new" products, in which case the discounts could be more modest. In that case, prices may bottom out at $229 and $255, respectively. But Wait, Apple Watches Are Already Hitting $199 Yes they are. But those aren't Series 1, they're "original" Apple Watches that have the slower processor. Those will likely still be for sale, as stores try to clear out old stock. While the CPU won't be as flashy, the original Apple Watch could sell for as low as $150, making it the cheapest way to try out the smartwatch technology for iOS. The original Apple Watch and the Series 1 watch have different processors and should be priced accordingly. But stores may be vague in their ads about which they're selling. Whether you're interested in the original or Series 1 Apple Watch, however, pay close attention to the specs when buying. Stores will probably be vague in ads about which model they're selling, saying only "Apple Watch" or "first-generation Apple Watch." If the price seems too good to be true for the Series 1, it's probably the original Apple Watch. Brand-New Apple Watch Series 2 Will Only See Modest Discounts Apple also debuted the Apple Watch Series 2, which offers waterproofing and GPS capabilities, among other things. Discounts on the original Apple Watch hit 15% on its first Black Friday, but it had been out for seven months by then; the Apple Watch Series 2 only has two months to drop in price, so we're expecting modest discounts of 5% for it's first Black Friday. Since the Apple Watch Series 2 starts at $369, that would put prices at: $350 (38mm Sport) $379 (42mm Sport) $569 (38mm stainless steel) $520 (42mm stainless steel) Bear in mind that all of these prices are for watches with the base-model band. Apple offers some pricey, high-end bands that can add as much as $400 to the price. For the new models, these deals will be available in a limited number of styles and colors, locking you into a low-end or high-end band option. Interestingly, while we expect the best discounts on the low-end models of other Apple products, the higher tier Watches have had the biggest percent discounts over the past year — with sales that cut the price by 10% more than other Watches. Of course, even with that discount, they come at a premium. Save Up to $200 on the iPhone 6s or $100 on the iPhone 7 With the arrival of the new iPhone 7, the list price of the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus have fallen by $100, and they have also received a memory bump. That means the base model 6s will now come with 32GB and cost $549. This Black Friday, we expect to see it discounted by $150 to $200, putting prices as low as $349 — or $1 to $50 for a down payment with a 2-year contract. The all-new iPhone 7 will likely match last year's deal of $100 off, giving it a starting price of $549, or a $99 down payment. Similar to the Apple Watch Series 1, there are now multiple models on the market that could be considered an "iPhone 6s." Traditionally, they start at 16GB, but the updated 6s starts at 32GB. So be careful when buying, and don't pay for more memory than you get. iPads Will Make Great Doorbusters There was no new iPad unveiled in September (although it still might come in October). But we do expect dramatic cuts on iPads this year, with solid discounts on older models — particularly the iPad Air 2 and mini 4. The price of the Air 2 was cut earlier this year, putting it at the same $399 price as the iPad mini 4. Combining this new lower price with Black Friday sales means we expect the iPad Air 2 to hit record lows. Based on this year's prices, we'll see the iPad Air 2 at $350 or less — possibly with doorbuster sales or gift card bundles that bring it down to $300 or lower. Every iPad model should see a discount this Black Friday, but the iPad Air 2 is primed to be a big doorbuster deal this year. Despite the fact that the Air 2 is currently the same price as the mini 4, the mini has traditionally seen steeper discounts. We expect to see it for $300, with doorbusters or gift card bundles that may drop it to $250. As for newer models, the 13" iPad Pro is now a year old. We saw small discounts on it last year, but this year we expect deals of up to 20% off, pricing the base model at $650. We'll also see some deals on the smaller 10" iPad Pro, though they'll be more modest — look for the base model to hit $550. MacBook Airs Will Drop to $700, While the iMac Could Hit $900 If you're looking for a new desktop or laptop, Black Friday is a good time to buy low-end models of both. For laptops, that's the 11" MacBook Air; for desktops it's the 21" iMac. Expect low-end 11" Airs at $700 and base model 21" iMacs at $900. We may see deals on higher end Macs — possibly iMacs with Retina displays — but expect them to be relatively minor. Where to Shop Anywhere but Apple The deals you'll find from Apple itself will be modest at best, and usually come in the form of gift cards or bundled items. In 2015, the retailer offered no Black Friday deals at all — but that didn't mean there weren't deals to be found elsewhere. Last year, the best deals on the new iPhone were at Best Buy and Target — though Target's deals tended to be phones bundled with gift cards. In fact, Target offered aggressive gift card bundles on a variety of Apple products in 2015. Gift card bundles can be a good deal if you'll use the gift card on other products, but you're still likely to pay full price (or nearly full price). Across the board, Best Buy, Walmart, and Target are likely candidates for big Apple deals during Black Friday. Also keep an eye on Staples, eBay, B&H Photo-Video, and Fry's Electronics for the sporadic discount. This article first appeared in DealNews.

It's run by the same minister who ran Tent City in Lakewood before it was shut down last year.

Although some might call her homeless, home for Vance is a small community in the woods about a half-mile from the Walmart on Route 9. She’s lived there a year with her pit bull, Trixie. The small encampment is also the home to eight others who once lived in Tent City, which was a community of about 120 homeless people living together in a wooded area of Lakewood. It was shut down by the township in July 2015. The Howell encampment is run by the same minister – the Rev. Steve Brigham of the Lakewood Outreach Ministry Church– who also started and operated Tent City. He spends his time helping homeless all over Monmouth and Ocean counties, he said.

The community doesn’t look much different than tents you’d see at a campground, except there are common areas like a mini chapel under a tarp, an open wooded structure that serves at the pantry and food storage area. There’s also pepper and tomato plants in buckets instead of in the ground, in case the folks had to leave in a hurry, Brigham said. Deeper into the woods, a path leads to rows of wildflowers and a community prayer garden the residents built. Buy Photo A homeless community has been established in the woods off Route 9 in Howell.

You could hear a pin drop at night, except for the crickets.” The encampment, which Howell Township knows about, is about a tenth of the size of Tent City. Folks who live there generally work or go out looking for work every day, Brigham said. “Rent around here is through the roof,” Brigham said. “If you’re low-income and single, it’s almost impossible to live around here.” READ: Lakewood's Tent City closes Vance, who recently got a job as a part-time janitor at an all-girls school in Lakewood, also cleans houses on the side. She lived in the original Tent City, but wasn’t one of the original members who got a year of free housing in a settlement with the township. She said she became homeless in 2013 when she found out her landlord was illegally renting to her and her roommate.

Vance said she receives disability payments after a severe accident she was in the year before. She has to pay for her propane, food and prescriptions, which would make paying rent difficult for her. Brigham, who also lives at the camp, said everyone respects each other and gets along well.

They’re regular, good people who just can’t make it work right now.” A lot of the homeless people who were living in Tent City are living in woods in Brick, Toms River, Howell, Lacey and Lakewood, Mayfield said. “We’ve chased them off private property several times when the owners have complained,” he said.

Mainstream media’s near-complete blackout on major stories and events is without a doubt the most interesting thing happening in the world today. Earlier today, WikiLeaks dropped a massive bombshell about the largest trade agreement ever made, which covers 52 countries and affects 80 percent of the economy in the U.S. and Europe, accounting for two-thirds of the global GDP. It will allow Wal-Mart economics to flourish on a global scale, forbidding the governments of participating nations from preferencing local businesses over foreign ones, and making it nearly impossible to stop those businesses from predatory pricing practices. In effect, there will be nothing stopping giant businesses from opening up shops on the corners of every neighborhood in any of the 52 participating nations, and using their wealth reserves to undercut the prices of all local businesses, forcing them to close and becoming the only business (and employer) of that type in the area. You know how every time a Wal-Mart opens in a new neighborhood it undercuts its competition and forces them to fold, offers new jobs at slave wages and then uses corporatist lobbying to protect itself from repercussions and shift the burden of the damage it does to the American taxpayer? It will be like that, only worldwide, with all businesses, including banks. You would be forgiven if you don’t know the name of the planet-altering trade deal I’m referring to, because you’ve never seen a news story on it. This would be the Trade in Service Agreement, or TiSA, also known as the TPP and TTIP’s secret brother. WikiLeaks revealed a major block of information about this agreement which will, without question, significantly alter the way humanity itself moves and behaves on this planet, and Wolf Blitzer’s dead-eyed face has nothing whatsoever to say about it. Why Do Six Companies Control 90% of the Media?: http://t.co/sh9aNtbMWu pic.twitter.com/NgeBt7H4xB — Adbusters (@Adbusters) September 2, 2015 Americans enjoy freedom of the press under the First Amendment of the Constitution because an informed populace is an essential ingredient in a healthy democracy, and citizens have understandably come to rely upon the press to provide that information. But time after time, story after story, important information has been getting swept under the rug by all the biggest news media providers in the country. The minority of Americans who are plugged into alternative news media have been witnessing a very different world unfold than those who get their news from CNN, Fox, or the New York Times. While we watched Bernie Sanders launch an unprecedented crowd-funded campaign to pack stadiums and win election battles he never should have been able to win, consumers of mainstream media were fed a constant diet of Donald Trump’s mouth farts. #SignsYoureABernieSupporter You & other @BernieSanders' supporters refuse MSM's #mediablackout to defeat him & us. pic.twitter.com/rirsyvnXL5 — KyleTaylorLucas (@KyleTaylorLucas) March 31, 2016 Tens of thousands of people were gathering for an unknown underdog, a man who even called himself that pariah term “democratic socialist” and who was calling for something as outrageous as a revolution, but that once-in-a-lifetime story went untold by the mass media. Only in Facebook groups could you see video of the moving scene of thousands of people from all walks of life lining up for blocks and blocks. Only through regular people’s updates and livestreams could you get the inside story of the voter suppression and voter culls, deliberate cutting of booths in a historically popular primary season and the long long lines it created, hundreds of stories of older, sicker, over-employed-but-underpaid people having to give up and leave the line before voting, dead people voting for Hillary, schools of mentally challenged people being bussed in to vote for Hillary, bosses giving their staff the day off as long as they voted for Hillary, dodgy machines, massively irregular exit polls and ex-presidents with bullhorns blocking the entrances to key polling booths for hours. I am so ready for a @BernieSanders revolution! #HIcaucus #FeelTheBern #BirdieSanders #MediaBlackout pic.twitter.com/QNb2DeFQR8 — Christie Sparrow (@sparrows1981) March 27, 2016 None of these stories were covered. Surely one of the biggest political uprisings in living memory was barely mentioned, and was mostly scorned by all the major news players, and as the season went on, a lot of the minor ones too. Alternative media outlets like The Onion were noticeably bought up by big-time Clinton donors, and their editorial immediately changed. It had the desired effect, too. A Harvard study confirmed that the media blackout alone fatally hindered Sanders’ momentum and lost him the election. In fact, if there was any coverage, it was to mock suggestions that the DNC were colluding against Sanders as “conspiracy theory.” Even when that conspiracy theory became conspiracy fact, there was no mea culpa from the media. In fact, they mocked people further by intimating that they had known all along it was rigged and somehow turned it around to make us look stupid again. We see what you did there. To mock people for suspecting what you secretly know is happening, and then mock them again by saying “Of course it happens” is double-dipping on the whole pompous mockery thing. You either knew, or you didn’t. The tag of “conspiracy theorist” is used to mollify anyone who doesn’t toe the corporate line. The assertions that Hillary might not be feeling so hot were shouted down as conspiracy theory and sexism and a Huffington Post writer even lost his job for pointing out the rumours about her health. Lost his job. For simply doing his actual job and reporting on what turned out to be the truth. Dr. Drew Pinksy was threatened and his show was axed days after suggesting that Hillary Clinton’s health care was a concern. Not even her health. Just the care she was getting. Is anyone else getting creeped out here? This is like an abusive gas lighting technique, but on a massive nation-wide scale. “You’re crazy! You’re insane! She’s fine! You’re a conspiracy nut!… Oh, she’s sick, but it’s nothing, she’s our gal, she’ll pull through, nothing to see here!” All in the space of a day. Yeah, that’s totally normal. Just this last week, a deluge of data has come from Guccifer 2.0 leaks, detailing proof of absolutely astounding government appointments, dizzyingly high-up jobs, including many positions of real national power like the FCC Chairman, auctioned off to the highest bidder. Obama was cheerily raking in the dough while selling off our most powerful public positions. This is possibly the most shocking revelation of Obama’s presidency, and the most damning indictment to come to light yet on the ever-growing history of deep corporate corruption among the Democrats, and do you think it made it to any of the leading newspapers? Nuh-uh. Not a peep. Not to mention the mercenaries setting their attack dogs on the Dakota Access Pipeline protestors. I mean that literally — there was no mention of it. Except of course by Democracy Now’s Amy Goodman, who got an arrest warrant for her efforts. Even Facebook is stopping protestors from sending out live streams. Look up any of these stories and there is a dearth of material on them. If you use Google, rather than Bing or Yahoo!, you will get even less. #MediaBlackout: Mercenaries Attack Thousands of #NativeAmericans. https://t.co/ywEozSznjG #NoDAPL #NativeLivesMatter pic.twitter.com/OOPGJXJJEr — النجم الملتهب (@kingk8888) September 6, 2016 What is this, Burma? Even they have given up censorship. And at least they used to give you the courtesy of selling the newspaper with the censored news blacked out. There are no black boxes in our newspapers hinting at what cannot be safely said or is not allowed to be known though. Just mockery where the news should be.

A photo of the display at the Walmart in Panama City, Fla. was posted to Twitter by user @online_shawn and immediately sparked outrage among online commentators who objected to the use of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks to sell Coke, as well as the arrangement of the Coke boxes to resemble the twin towers in front of an American flag. "We will never forget," reads a banner bearing the Coca-Cola and Walmart logos. Walmart spokesman Charles Crowson said the display was being removed following the online outcry. Crowson told the Orlando Weekly the display was pitched to Walmart by Coke, and the store approved it. "We hold this moment in our country's history in the highest regard, and there was nothing disrespectful intended by the display being assembled. It was removed from our Florida store Wednesday," Walmart said in a statement emailed to Mashable. Coca-Cola spokeswoman Kimberly Kuo said the display was misinterpreted. "This display was meant to honor local firefighters and to support their organization's upcoming event," she told CNBC. "We sincerely apologize that anyone was offended or misunderstood its intent and we have replaced the display."  (Votes: 0) Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

The accused shoplifter, Ramon Martinez, 43, of Newark, and a second man, Diego C. Dosreis, age 28, also of Newark, have been charged, Hudson County Prosecutor Esther Suarez said. Martinez is charged with eluding, receiving stolen property and shoplifting. Dosreis has been charged with receiving stolen property, Prosecutor's Office spokesman Ray Worrall said. The Kearny police officer who shot Martinez was not injured, but he was evaluated at a local hospital, which is standard procedure when an officer fires his weapon, Kearny Mayor Al Santos said. The officer, who was not identified, is a veteran of the force, the mayor said. Martinez was struck in "an extremity," the Prosecutor's Office said, and he is in stable condition at a local hospital. Santos said the shooting appeared to be justified. "The suspect is believed to have been a fleeing shoplifter and he threatened the officer with his vehicle," Santos said. "The officer had to respond. He shot at the suspect because he was threatened by the suspect's vehicle as he tried to get away from the police officer trying to apprehend him." Santos said the officer fired multiple shots and at least one struck Martinez in the parking lot of the store on Harrison Avenue. The incident is being reviewed, as is customary, by the Hudson County Prosecutor's Office, which did not provide any further details on the incident. "When faced with an oncoming car, it seems to me it was an appropriate response," Santos said. "The incident is under review and if there are any questions, we will be looking at them." Santos credited his detectives for tracking down the shoplifter and his alleged accomplice. "The detectives who were able to apprehend the suspect, their police work was outstanding," Santos said. "The suspect had fled after the shooting in the parking lot and the Kearny Detective Squad, based on information they collected at scene, were able to apprehend him later in Newark. "It's important that the suspect was arrested ... (as) it is also a deterrent because you know there is an effective response and police officers will be on the scene promptly and an arrest will be made."

The small plaza planned for the former site of St. John Lutheran Church across from Wal-Mart has been back to the Planning and Zoning Commission several times over the summer, but its owner says he is now ready to build. “It would have been easier to do everything all at once, but the timing didn’t work out that way,” said Norm Thibeault, of Killingly Engineering Associates, which represents Toudis LLC, the developer of the plaza. Toudis has been approved to take out a large retaining wall that was part of its first approval from the commission. The removal of the wall, which Thibeault said in June was estimated to cost $200,000, was made possible because Jimmie Moutoudis, owner of Toudis LLC, purchased an adjacent property and can now grade the slope. In August Toudis also asked for a change to the look of the building. Now, instead of one building which would house a Dunkin’ Donuts and other businesses, the Dunkin’ Donuts will stand alone with a 15-foot patio between it and the rest of the building. Thibeault said the overall footprint of the building remains the same. Moutoudis said he plans to use a new store design by Dunkin’ Donuts that would make the location one of only a handful in the country with that new look. “This will be a special place,” Toudis said. “There won’t be another Dunkin’ Donuts like it anywhere around here.” Moutoudis has indicated he wants to break ground as soon as possible. Syl Pauley, engineer for the Northeast Connecticut Council of Governments and the town engineer for Brooklyn, said the removal of the retaining wall and the new plan for grading the property meets all the necessary codes and standards. Community Development Director Jana Butts Roberson said the new landscape slope will be much more visually appealing than the retaining wall would have been. The slope will be landscaped with a small shrub native to the area. Roberson and Commission Vice Chairman Michelle Sigfridson had hoped to persuade Toudis to remove five parking spots meant for employees from its site plan. “I don’t think they are necessary,” Roberson said. “I think it will be more attractive without them.”Other commission members, however, felt that as long as the parking was within regulations they should not force Toudis to reduce parking spaces. “I think the employee parking spaces are a matter of personal preference to the extent it complies with our regulations and it’s reasonable, I have a hard time telling them not to put in the parking spaces,” commission member Jeryl Mohn said.

The group of 45 volunteers, ranging in age from 14 to 71, from area churches - Faith Family, Parkway Baptist, Northside Baptist, First English Lutheran, Emmanuel Lutheran in Inez and First Baptist of Lolita - gave up their Labor Day weekend to serve others devastated by the recent floods in Baton Rouge. This team personally saw to it that more than 8,000 square feet of buildings and homes were gutted and cleaned up to air out so that rebuilding can take place. Read more To read more about the trip see Barbara Breazeale's blog at victoriaadvocate.com/blogs/reader/entries/2016/sep/07/victoria-angels-work-flood-victims-september-6-2016/ To help If you want to help, please send a check or Wal-Mart gift cards to Bethany Church at 13855 Plank Road, Baker, LA 70714. You can contact Cameron Wiggins at 225-773-7581. Let them know how you want it used. Call or send to Faith Family Church, 2002 Mockingbird Lane, Victoria, TX 77903, 361-573-2484 and they will direct you. Talk to Outreach Pastor Mark Longoria. Scott Bauer, volunteer missions coordinator for Faith Family Church, helped organize a trip from Victoria to Louisiana to help flood victims. It became a multi-church effort with 45 volunteers ranging in age from 14 to 71 from Faith Family, Parkway, Northside Baptist and First English Lutheran churches making the Labor Day weekend trip. Victoria businessman Steve Seawalt donated two camper trailers to be used for flood victims to live in and four vehicles for single mothers. Below is a condensed blog post by Barbara Breazeale about the trip. Scott Bauer, a parishioner of Faith Family Church, had a great idea. He wanted to bring a crew from Victoria to Baker, La., and clean up flood debris. My husband, Bill Pozzi, told me about it this way, "Guess what? You and I are going to Louisiana." The people of Faith Family Church responded in volume, and 45 people left for long Labor Day weekend. Our destination was Bethany Church. When we arrived, we were greeted by unbelievable devastation at Bethany Church. The downstairs of this huge church and school had 3.5 to 4 feet of water inside it, and according to bystanders, "looked like huge indoor pool." All of the walls up to 4 plus feet were knocked out down to the studs. Carpet and flooring was ripped up and furniture had been ditched onto the front area. We were able to stay for free in their upstairs rooms, men in one wing and women in the other. They provided blow up mattresses and had trucks with showers in them for all the other volunteers who had come to help. More than 140 volunteers were in the building that weekend, some from Oklahoma, some from Tennessee. Bethany was sending out gut and clean teams. When you gut a home, they want all the wet drywall down to the studs removed, all furniture, all carpet, cabinets, all contents, so that the next team of "spray for mold" can come in. That is looked upon as homeowner or business' job, not insurance company. What was so amazing were the stories. I spoke to Betty Ann Thomas, who is on the Pastoral Support Team at Bethany. Their staff had been working 18 days with no break when we arrived, and their church is open 24 hours a day. Thomas said their church's first thought was to help widows, elderly and single moms. They put out an application for people to sign up for help, and they were inundated. This help was offered to everyone, not just people who went to Bethany Church. Thousands of homes were destroyed and people needed help. Most of the homes were not in a floodplain, and the residents had never experienced water of any kind. Ninety percent, including Bethany Church, did not have flood insurance. Thomas said her home was on very high ground so many people parked their vehicles at her house. She was on the front porch having coffee when it began to rain so hard that you could not see. The area received more than 33 inches of rain in less than 24 hours. When the rain slowed a bit, she saw a wall of water coming toward their house. All of the cars they were saving were destroyed and her house took on 6 feet of water. Luckily, she has flood insurance, but even that does not begin to cover all of it. Thomas has an amazing attitude about all of it. She says she gets teary-eyed when she thinks of the lost photos and sentimental items. She found her deceased father's picture in the water, shook it off and it had faded, but she was happy about that. I gave her gift card donated by an angel in Victoria and she cried. She sang to me her song, "Lord, I look to You" to describe her feelings. The first day, they asked me to help with phones as they were processing hundreds of people. I called for more than five hours, and the stories and tears were flowing. The rest of the crew went to a local church and gutted it. That story was amazing as well. The church has a small congregation and 4,000 square feet of building. They had prayer warriors praying to get help as their group tried to do as much as they could. The problem was, so many of their own were gutting their own houses. When the Faith Family "machine" arrived the congregation was in tears and felt their prayers had been answered. The machine gutted the entire place in half a day and took out all the contents to the street. I walked neighborhoods handing out gift cards donated by angels in Victoria Jerry Beezet is retired and in his 70s. He had lived in his neighborhood for more than 35 years, which never flooded. He broke down crying when I handed him a gift card. Beezet has no insurance and lost everything. One home, which took on water over the roof line, was just a stick house inside when I arrived. The residents said they had five crosses in their house. When they opened the door, chairs were slammed against windows and everything moved about the house, but the five crosses never moved. She smiled and said she knew God was with her. One of my favorite stories was Lucille Cooper, a lovely white-haired lady. For 40 years, she has lived in her home with her horses and six dogs. On the day when it rained and rained, she got her horses and dogs out and came back to secure some items. The back window blew out with huge wall of water and she ran to get into the attic. She looked out and the water was a foot from the bottom of the attic floor. She used her cellphone to call for help, and the first responder arrived on a Jet Ski. They cut a hole in her roof and she rode out on the Jet Ski. Her home is a total loss, and she is living in trailer until she decides what to do. She and I prayed together as well. I felt like crying, but she was smiling and OK. Everyone who made this trip will never be the same again. If you came with troubles and problems, you soon realized that yours were easy compared to what we saw. It restored your faith in God and humanity.

Between tricks, treats and costumes, Halloween spending was estimated to top $6.9 billion in 2015, with adults spending $74 each between costumes, candy and more, according to data from the National Retail Federation. But if you're hoping to celebrate Halloween on a budget, look no further. Here are nine low-cost Halloween costume ideas for your kids. 1. Owl Costume Mimi Green of MimiCutLips.com created an adorable owl costume for her daughter for less than $15. She used a hooded sweatshirt as the base and felt to create the feathers, which she sewed under each sleeve and on the front of a sweatshirt. You can use hot glue to attach the feathers, she said — just put cardboard inside the sweatshirt so the glue doesn’t soak through, and stick the sides together. She also used felt to create the owl face, which she stitched to the hood of the sweatshirt. To get this costume for under $10, pick up a used sweatshirt at a secondhand store, or use one you already own. Jo-Ann's frequently offers 40 to 60 percent off coupons for regular-priced items, too, and felt only costs $5.99 per yard, or $2.99 when on sale. 2. Carrot Costume The carrot costume Menucha Citron of MomsandCrafters.com made for her son didn’t require any sewing — just hot glue. She glued an orange piece of felt cut in the shape of a carrot to a shirt and paired it with orange pants. For the carrot top, she made a hat out of green burlap ribbon, using hot glue to hold it together. 3. Cow Costume Lynnae McCoy transformed her daughter into an adorable black-and-white cow on a budget using a long sleeve white shirt, black leggings and felt bought at Walmart. She used fabric glue to attach the black felt cut into spot shapes and pink felt for the udders. She found cow ears and a tail at Walmart to complete the look — but you can make one with felt to save on the cost. See: 10 Outrageously Expensive Halloween Costumes for Pets 4. Cactus Costume If you're trying to save this fall, look to this cactus costume from Rachel Hollis of The Chic Site. The blogger often relies on her DIY skills to make Halloween costumes for her boys. She once made cactus costumes for her and her son. All it took to make this clever costume: a green sweatshirt, sweatpants and pipe cleaners. Hollis cut the pipe cleaners into 2-inch pieces and glued them onto the sweats in groupings of one to four. 5. Jellyfish Costume If your kid wants to be a marine biologist when she grows up — as Erin Burt's daughter does — then a jellyfish is the perfect costume. And it certainly looks a lot cuter than the real thing. Burt glued pink material to an umbrella and then attached ribbon with hot glue to create tentacles. She dangled frilly white ribbon from the center of the umbrella to create the jellyfish's "oral arms," as Burt's daughter told her they are called. Then, her daughter held the umbrella over her head while trick-or-treating to give the illusion that she was a jellyfish. 6. Robot Costume What little boy wouldn’t love to be a robot for Halloween? Jamie Roubinek of Roubinek Reality was able to make her son look like one mainly with things she found around the house. She used two boxes covered in foil to create a robot body and head, then added an old CD, bottle caps, solo cups and printouts of gauges found online to accessorize. Dryer duct found at a home improvement store was used to cover her son’s arms and legs, and foil was wrapped around his shoes. 7. Cat in the Hat Costume Mary Hoover of MissiontoSave.com relied on Dr. Seuss for inspiration for costumes for her three sons. She turned her oldest into the Cat in the Hat using a black sweatshirt and sweatpants bought at a thrift store, white gloves, red felt for a bow, and a red and white hat that she bought but said could be made using felt if you sew. Read: 13 Children’s Books That Teach Money Lessons She dressed her younger sons as the Cat’s sidekicks — Thing 1 and Thing 2 — using red sweatsuits purchased at a thrift store, blue ski hats and blue yarn. She used white paint and a marker to create the Thing 1 and Thing 2 labels on their tops. Hoover said the yarn could be sewn or hot glued onto the caps to create hair. 8. Caterpillar Costume Maura White bought a monarch butterfly costume for her oldest daughter and wanted a costume for her toddler that would complement it. However, she couldn’t find a monarch caterpillar costume, so the frugal mom behind Happy Deal Happy Day opted to make one. She found a black and white romper on Amazon then used fabric markers to color every other stripe yellow. Then, White fashioned antennae out of black pipe cleaners attached to a black headband. 9. Day of the Dead Costume Here's an easy costume for under $10. Gina Kleinworth was inspired by sugar skulls used in the Mexican celebration of the Day of the Dead and decided to create a similar look on her daughter’s face for Halloween. This Day of the Dead costume only requires face paint — and a very steady hand. She added a large flower to her daughter’s hair to complete the look. You can find step-by-step instructions for creating a Day of the Dead face at her blog, Kleinworth Co.

(MATT BUTTON | AEGIS STAFF / Baltimore Sun) Bryna ZumerContact ReporterThe Aegis Walmart's Abingdon store is expected to be bigger than Fallston's in 2019 Privacy Policy Walmart hopes to start construction on its Abingdon store expansion in 2018, with "minimal impact on store operations," the company said Wednesday. The Constant Friendship Boulevard retail store would grow from 137,449 square feet to 187,627 square feet, according to a site plan submitted earlier to the Harford County government. The expanded Abingdon store will be about 24,000 square feet larger than the Fallston Walmart that opened in 2011. The upgraded store is expected to open to the public in the spring of 2019, Erik Hingst, director of Walmart Public Affairs & Government Relations for Maryland, said via email.

"Our goal is to continue to work with the elected officials, staff and the community in the open, transparent and professional manner they have established," Hingst said. Walmart held a community input meeting on the expansion in July.

According to KTXL-TV, the unnamed victim approached the male suspect, whose girlfriend was driving the vehicle the couple was in, and accused the woman of parking illegally. That’s when things got heated. An unnamed suspect who police believe beat a disabled elderly man is seen in a Wal-Mart parking lot in Fairfield, California. (Image source: KTXL-TV) “All of a sudden, the guy just attacked him — older gentleman,” Chris Benett, who witnessed the incident with his girlfriend Suzie Fowler, said. “Opened up his door, grabbed him around his neck, punched him a couple of times.” Fowler added, “We have parents, too. It’s hard to imagine something like that happening to them. You don’t really think about your safety in that type of circumstance.” Benett, who is a disabled veteran, came to the rescue of the elderly man. Meanwhile, Fowler started to record the incident. The suspect and his girlfriend, realizing that they had met their match, took off in separate vehicles just moments later. But before they left, the suspect reportedly shouted at Fowler to stop recording. Fowler refused, and threatened to release her pitbull that was still in the car if he tried to touch her. Fairfield police are now looking for the suspect. Benett, for his part, is warning whoever the suspect is to turn himself in because “next time [he] might not be so lucky.” — Follow the author of this story on Twitter and Facebook: Follow @jonstreet Share Tweet Rate this story Recommended from the Web 123 Comments Show Comments Get TheBlaze Newsletters Sign Up Refer Friends, Earn Rewards!

King Soopers has started offering online grocery ordering that can be picked up curbside. (Photo: Valerie Mosley/The Coloradoan)Buy Photo 77 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE Dani Ullmann pulled up to the prescribed parking spot at North College Marketplace early Thursday. Within five minutes, she was headed home with a car full of groceries. Ullmann's pickup is part of King Soopers' new ClickList program that allows shoppers to order groceries online and pick them up curbside at its North Fort Collins store. King Soopers is the latest grocer to expand shoppers' options — from offering curbside pickup to home delivery — to cater to a customer base that often has more money than time. The service lets shoppers avoid checkout lines. For parents, it means no longer having to haul the kids out of the car and saying "no" to requests for candy bars and cookies. "It was awesome," said Ullmann, of Fort Collins. "It makes it easier to stick to a list and easier to stick to a budget. I got exactly what I wanted and was not in the store buying whatever." Typically, her weekly grocery bill is about $120. This day, it was $60. SHOPPING:  Sales slump at Loveland outlet mall Ullmann is among a growing consumer base redefining what it means "to go" to the store. Mary Blake and Abbey Irvine may also be converts. "Having just given birth to our second child, it is very convenient," Blake wrote in reply to a Coloradoan Facebook post. "Not only do I not need to bring the newborn out ... my husband can also swing by and pick (the groceries) up after work." Irving said grocery shopping with her two kids is no fun for anyone. Instead, she goes to her computer to virtually cruise store aisles. "I've shopped online at Walmart and love the convenience," Irvine said. Now she can add King Soopers to her list. "This is about meeting customers where they are,"  said Kelli McGannon, spokeswoman for King Soopers Colorado. "Some people will need home delivery. Some will like ordering online and picking groceries up on their way home from work. Some people just like to go to the grocery store." Whichever option works best for each consumer is where King Soopers wants to be. NEWS:  How sales taxes change your grocery bill Buy Photo King Soopers on North College Avenue in Fort Collins has started offering online grocery ordering that can be picked up curbside.  (Photo: Valerie Mosley/The Coloradoan) King Soopers offers ClickList in Greeley and will launch it at its 1275 Eagle Drive store in Loveland on Nov. 29. Walmart has a similar curbside program available at its Loveland store. Neither Albertsons nor Safeway has a similar program in Fort Collins, but the corporation that runs both chains recently launched home delivery in the Denver market. Customers were the driving force behind Albertsons' new service, said Kris Staaf, director of public affairs for Safeway and Albertsons in Colorado. Staaf said the company had more requests for home delivery in the Denver market than any other market in the country. For what may be the last marketplace to go digital, online ordering is the fastest-growing segment for the $675 billion U.S. grocery market. Grocers are setting the stage for what could be the next big opportunity for eCommerce, according to Morgan Stanley Research. More than a third of online shoppers expected to buy their groceries online this year, the company reported. Blurring the lines  According to Nielsen, a global company that studies consumer habits, grocery stores are blurring the lines between the physical and digital worlds. It's no surprise that a 2015 analysis of the future of grocery stores found 30 percent of millennials, ages 21-34, said they order groceries online for home delivery compared to 22 percent of Generation X (ages 35-49) and 17 percent of baby boomers. "Millennials are at the beginning of their careers and are starting to form households," said Nielsen's Patrick Dodd in the report. The generation "will shape our economy for decades to come, therefore it is critical that retailers understand how these consumers are using technology and include digital touch points along the entire path to purchase." Neither McGannon nor Staaf would quantify the success of their new programs for competitive reasons, but each said the programs have been well received. Peta St. Aoro at King Soopers said ClickList has served about 10 customers daily in its first week. BUSINESS NEWS:  Noosa Yoghurt sues competitor over similar packaging "People want options," Staaf said. "They want to be able to shop when they want, how they want.  We see people using the (delivery) service who are time-starved, living in urban areas. We're also seeing some people with limited mobility" who may need grocery delivery for a short time. McGannon said King Soopers has hired between seven and 10 additional staff at each store that offers curbside pickup. The service's cost, $4.95 per trip after the first three visits, is well worth it for people who value time more than money, although like Ullmann, McGannon says she saves money, too, because she avoids buying anything that's not on her shopping list. Ullmann's teenage daughter, Maria, likes curbside pickup because it saves time. "She takes so long in the store," she said about her mother. "She has a list but then goes through the aisles and says things like, 'I need this, I need this." Her mom is also a label reader, which means she makes healthier purchases, but takes much more time to find them.

The items should look familiar; they're a sample of items you've recently purchased. Don't see what you need? Browse by department or type in the item and several choices will come up by size and brand. For those who like their bananas a little on the green side, or avocados that are ready to eat today, there's a spot to write notes to the employee who will fulfill your order. The order is stored in refrigerators and freezers until delivery time. When you arrive at the ClickList parking spots, call the store and they'll send your order out. FORT COLLINS:  Food Co-Op rooted in community It took less than two minutes for clerks to arrive with Ullmann's order, she said. It took another five minutes to load and pay. If she hadn't stopped to talk to a reporter she would have been headed home within 10 minutes of arriving. When your order is complete, you can pay with a credit card online or check when you arrive to pick up your order at a prescribed time between 7 a.m. and 8 p.m., McGannon said. "Our goal is to stay focused on the customer and the customer is changing," she said. Who offers online options? King Soopers: Curbside pickup at North College Marketplace, 1842 N. College Ave. Home delivery is also available throughout Fort Collins.  Kingsoopers.com/ClickList. Orders must be placed 24 hours in advance. Cost: $4.95 per order, although the first three orders are free.   Safeway/Albertsons: Home delivery available in Denver metro area. The corporation is exploring expansion into other markets. Cost is based on delivery time, between $6.95 and $9.95.  Walmart: Curbside pickup available at Loveland store, 1325 Denver Ave. $30 minimum order. Pickup hours between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. Service is free. 77 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://noconow.co/2cswQEV TOP VIDEOS Which stores are opening, closing Thanksgiving Day 0:34 Why it's time to change your holiday shopping plans 0:35 Cuban coffee available in U.S. for first time in over 50 years 0:40 Girl Scout cookie cereal is a real thing and happening soon 1:10 Pennies worth $1k hidden across U.S. 0:39 What college students really buy with student loans 0:36 Major retailers buck trend of starting Black Friday on Thanksgiving 1:09 Toyota recalls Prius cars over faulty brakes 0:30 America's biggest mall makes bold Thanksgiving move 0:23 Elizabeth Warren rips into Wells Fargo CEO 0:52

The McDuffie County Sheriff’s Office says 18-year-old Christopher Hayes and 18-year-old Joshua Hadden are both charged with disorderly conduct. According to an incident report from Thursday evening, the teens admitted to trying to scare people. Just before 10:30 p.m., one teen was wearing the clown mask as he drove through the parking lot. Witnesses were able to give a license plate number to investigators. That’s what led deputies to question the teens. The mask was found in the Walmart parking lot. Investigators say there is no evidence tying these two suspects to the incident at the bus stop in the Davis Circle area. That incident is still under investigation. Hayes and Hadden are scheduled to appear in McDuffie County Magistrate Court on October 20, 2016 at 3 p.m. The McDuffie County Sheriff’s Office is thanking the public for the help in solving this case.

"Following" : "Follow"}} September 16, 2016 8:57am   Comments Share: Related WMT Mid-Afternoon Market Update: Children's Place Rises On Strong Q3 Results; DryShips Shares Tumble 20 Biggest Mid-Day Losers For Thursday Wall Street Breakfast: Major Overhaul At Volkswagen (Seeking Alpha) Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE: WMT) witnessed a return of traffic growth against a deteriorating environment. Although there’s nothing very exciting, the company is “better than many staples retail alternatives,” Credit Suisse’s Edward J. Kelly said in a report. He assigned an Outperform rating and $80 price target on Wal-Mart, versus the previous Neutral rating and $62 price target. Wal-Mart witnessed traffic growth due to its in-store investments and improvement in low-end consumer. While stating that this progress was “encouraging,” given the worsening staples retail landscape, “there is more work to do,” Kelly commented. As management makes further investments, Wal-Mart’s top-line momentum would likely continue. Related Link: Wal-Mart Investments In Low-Pricing Put Pressure On Everyone From Grocers To Dollar Stores Structural Headwinds “E-commerce, accelerating brick-and-mortar competition, an over-reliance on "Big Food" to drive traffic, a general lack of differentiation in its stores outside of price, and ongoing deflation represent meaningful headwinds for WMT,” Kelly wrote. He added that management was investing heavily to address the issue and strengthen Wal-Mart’s competitive position in the US. Key Driver Of Stock Performance U.S. comp growth has been the key driver of Wal-Mart’s stock performance and should continue. Although comp growth of 1.0-1.5 percent “isn't overly impressive,” several peers have witnessed declines, Kelly noted. He added, “Further investments should drive continued top-line gains, although the ultimate return is still uncertain.” Do you have ideas for articles/interviews you'd like to see more of on Benzinga? Please email feedback@benzinga.com with your best article ideas.

By Lolade Awogbade   |   16 September 2016   |   10:25 am Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on LinkedIn Share via Email ’Sustainability is good for business’’ A week ago I had a brief conversation with a senior colleague. He is Brazilian and lives in Nigeria. Activities on his Brazilian ranch are in perfect sync with his immediate local government. The outputs from his ranch transform into impact on a national scale. He, having a birds’ eye view of Brazil and Nigeria turned and said- ‘what is Nigeria doing about sustainability? I hear a lot of fancy words but I don’t see anything happening’. I walked away from that conversation with a myriad of thoughts; because you see, as a sustainability professional in Nigeria, I knew that even though there was a lot of talk, this has yet to translate into real meaning for our country. As a nation, we have signed up to a few international sustainability conventions. In addition, the Nigerian financial industry has created a sustainability code. The truth? The man on the street has no idea what sustainability is and how this translates into real value for himself and his immediate community. Whilst not trying to proffer an ultimate solution, this article seeks to explore suggestions for a more practical sustainability approach for Nigeria.  Sometimes, it is through the journey that one stumbles upon the solutions. In 2015, the Nigerian government signed up to the SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals) – a new set of global sustainability goals put together by international sustainability experts including our very own Minister for the Environment Mrs. Amina J. Mohammed. A laudable effort for sure, however what has that really meant for the average Nigerian? I can tell you now, it is still seen as a very ‘fanciful’ concept; nothing to worry about just yet. Faced with more pressing domestic issues, Nigerians today will respond ‘’ have I finished setting food on the table before I start thinking about climate change’’. And that, is just my point. We must make the sustainability conversation one that is relevant and DOES put food (or power) on the table for the average Nigerian whilst also having an impact on our environment. Nigerian banks today subscribe to a set of regulations/guidelines developed by the apex bank in conjunction with other stakeholders in the financial industry- the Nigerian Sustainability Business Principles. As a sustainability professional in financial services I can tell you without a doubt that apart from being an intrinsic source of pride to the sector, it is more of a have to do, than a change creator. How much reach has the adoption of the principles had in terms of concrete change to the lives and environment of Nigerians? Only the apex bank can actually tell us. However, banks ensure that they submit those half yearly reports on time; ticking the invisible box of ‘’duty completed’’. I am going somewhere, stay with me reader. To date, Brazil is still one of the best examples of how sustainability is really meant to be ‘lived out’.  It is by no accident that I started with an anecdote from a Brazilian colleague. Brazil has embraced the concept of sustainability in such a way that even the common man gets it. He understands how sustainability really does ‘’put food on his table’’. In 2013, Brazil created a public-private partnership vehicle – Brazilian Business and Ecosystem Services Partnership (PESE). This group was made up of corporate players from the retail, mining, agribusiness, cosmetics and food & beverage sectors in conjunction with government headed environmental agencies. The PESE had the sole aim of institutionalizing sustainability into Brazil. Clear case of moving from rhetoric to practical demonstration. Allow me to use two illustrative examples: Walmart in Brazil tackled the environmental challenges associated with its supply of beef. Because cattle ranches occupy more than 70 percent (PDF) of the deforested Amazon region, Walmart set a target of achieving a beef supply chain with zero deforestation by 2015. To help achieve this target, Walmart’s ESR examined cattle ranching practices that reduced deforestation. Another example is Danone, a dairy multinational, focused on evaluating strategic opportunities and risks to its main children’s product line. In collaboration with local NGO Ipê, it identified ways to help dairy farmers in its supply chain boost the biodiversity and soil quality in their pastures for higher-grade milk and lower operational costs for the company. Dear reader you will notice that I haven’t used a European country nor a North American state as a comparative example. Similar to Brazil, Nigeria’s agriculture sector would be a great place to kick off an impactful sustainability movement. In terms of internal cultural and economic make up, Brazil in a lot of ways can be compared to Nigeria. The idea is not to copy Brazil and its techniques but to pay attention to strategies that have been successful and learn lessons for our own story. Similar to examples earlier in the article, the creation of key partnerships between corporate players and government led environmental agencies especially in the local food and beverages sector would be would be a great way to make an impact especially in the development of local communities and the deployment of environmental conservation techniques. Both go hand in hand with strong economic growth. Let’s take a look at a Nigerian example. Recent research has shown that the ratio of NPK fertilizer (nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium) used on our soils may not have been optimum for the different existing Nigerian soil types. Using the 15:15:15 ratio has eroded the nutrient level of the soil and led to an inability of the nutrients to self-regenerate. Poor soil types equally reduced quality of yield. This research is coming after years and years of farmers using a 15:15:15 mix. Imagine the loss!  With increased private and public sector partnerships, funding is better targeted allowing for timelier intervention strategies to be deployed. Another area could be in the provision of funding along the agriculture value chain: from more effective input distribution to post harvest management practices and intermediate processing techniques. The opportunities are rife and waiting to be taken advantage of. They provide gains for the immediate communities and create strong business propositions as well. Where others see chaos, I see opportunity. But taking advantage of this opportunity requires a renewed focus and honesty. Let’s stop the rhetoric and get practical. We have a government that is open to discussion and willing to listen. Taking advantage of this opportunity is staring us in the face. What’s your next move going to be?

Events Close 1 of 2 The Commonwealth Fund Buy Now Tim Hynds, Sioux City Journal Carlson GUEST COLUMN Guest column: The disruption of health care in the United States Greg Carlson Sep 16, 2016 (…) +1  Buy Now Carlson Tim Hynds, Sioux City Journal The Commonwealth Fund Health care is going through a period of dramatic transformation. Clayton Christensen, author of "The Innovator’s Prescription," writes about disruptive innovation that is transforming industries, including health care. He states that “the auto, computer, and telecommunication industries all underwent drastic transformation when a simple, affordable and, ultimately, superior product challenged the status quo.” In each case, the innovative product that turned the industry on its head by lowering costs and increasing consumer access was discounted by industry leaders who deemed the product or idea inferior and lacking the potential for profit. Companies with traditional business models like Best Buy and Walmart are being disrupted by Amazon, the online retailer who reported $107 billion in revenue in 2015. In fact, Walmart announced in July that it is acquiring jet.com for $3.3 billion to take on Amazon. Another victim of disruption is Blockbuster, which filed bankruptcy because its business model could not compete with Netflix and Redbox. There are at least five transformational changes affecting the delivery of health care services in the United States: Transparency and the value proposition; medical tourism; health care information technology (IT); health care integration; and wellness/prevention. The driving force behind these changes is the rising cost of health care in the United States which grew 5.3 percent in 2014, reaching $3.0 trillion or $9,523 per person (17.5 percent of the nation’s Gross Domestic Product), nearly double the cost of other industrialized countries. Where is the best care? Health care in the United States is characterized by significant variations in the cost and quality of care provided by competing organizations which has been well documented by organizations including the Dartmouth Atlas of Health, the Commonwealth Fund, and more recently by national employers like Lowe’s and Pepsi Cola. The good news is that the Midwest consistently ranks as the region of the United States that provides the overall best health care. In spite of this positive news, wide variations persist nationally, regionally and locally in the cost and quality of healthcare services. The South Dakota Association of Healthcare Organizations reported for 2015 that the range in charges for hip replacement surgery varied from a low of $37,061 to a high of $58,234. As the cost of health care continues to rise faster than wages, consumers are demanding information on prices and quality (transparency) so they can make informed choices regarding where they seek health care services. Transparency and medical tourism Transparency in health care is characterized by the visibility or accessibility of outcome date (cost and quality) that is easy to understand. In a transparent environment, health care providers (hospitals, clinics and physicians) compete for business like most companies. Consumers compare the value of competing businesses, creating winners and losers. In the past month, Aetna Health Insurance rolled out its Institutes of Quality (IOQ) Orthopedic Care program focused on transparency related to clinical quality and cost efficiency. The Aetna program is similar to the Bundled Payment Care Initiative (BPCI) program being piloted by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). Medical tourism is the growing phenomenon where patients travel outside of the region where they live for healthcare services. Medical tourism includes patients who traveled out of the country for health care as well as patients who travel within the United States to receive care. When Lowe’s (home improvement) and PepsiCo analyzed the variation in the cost and quality of the care their employees and dependents were receiving for cardiac and orthopedic care both companies contracted with nationally recognized providers at a guaranteed price. Lowe’s selected the Cleveland Clinic for cardiac care and PepsiCo selected Johns Hopkins Medical Center for cardiac and orthopedic care. An example of medical tourism on a global basis occurred when a close friend of mine needed a hernia repair procedure and, after comparing the outcomes and the price at his local hospital in Wisconsin, decided to travel to London to have his procedure performed at the British Hernia Centre, which promotes itself as the "world’s leading specialist in hernia repair." Not only does the British Hernia Centre offer the latest techniques and publish its outcomes, it also offers a guaranteed bundled price for the entire procedure that is less than 25 percent of the charge of providers in the United States. Next time: We'll look at three additional changes that are transforming health care. Greg Carlson is CEO for Center for Neurosciences, Orthopaedics & Spine (CNOS). He will be contributing quarterly. +1  Buy Now Carlson Tim Hynds, Sioux City Journal Tags Greg Carlson Health Care Company Care Aetna Patient Cost Consumer Announce your event Find forms and guidelines for submitting weddings, engagements, anniversaries, births and birthdays.

Bickford (SUBMITTED PHOTO) Print Email Mike Plaisance | mplaisance@repub.com By Mike Plaisance | mplaisance@repub.com The Republican Email the author | Follow on Twitter on September 16, 2016 at 8:00 AM, updated September 16, 2016 at 11:46 PM comments HOLYOKE -- The unpleasant truth is there are people in this city today who aren't exactly saddened that James F. Bickford is dead. That's a function, I guess, of Bickford's brilliance at sometimes coming across as a jerk and the oh-so-Holyoke tunnel-vision inability to forget hurt feelings, nurturing slights real and imagined over a course of years like a chef stirring a stew. Believe me, I know what that's like. Bickford, 46, was killed Sunday when police said he lost control of the motorcycle he was riding and was ejected while traveling through Stafford, Connecticut. He was -- at times -- an activist, an agitator, a verbal bomb-thrower, a left-wing zealot, an all-in-black-clad Watchman who used essays and altered photos and videos on his website to spotlight what he considered politicians' shortcomings. Some said he got off on humiliating people. I don't think that's true. What some of the thin-skinned are unable to dwell on or will downplay is that Bickford also was a man devoted to his family, his partner Rachel and four children. He was an artist, one of the best-read people I came to know in Holyoke, an astute handicapper of political races and someone his friends knew would help, whatever the time or place. And the guy could write. My association with Bickford began with me despising him. This included a police report on Oct. 26, 2011. That night I was part of a media panel asking questions of then-Mayor Elaine A. Pluta and then-challenger Alex B. Morse at Dean Technical High School. The debate was over and I'd stepped off stage and there was Bickford. His video camera aimed at my face, Bickford said, "Those were some shitty questions." Then, the agitator in action: Bickford asked me if I was a "beef-witted ----" -- the last word being that vulgar female-anatomy reference that is so jarring to hear aloud in a public setting. I said something -- I must have, but I don't remember what -- and kept walking. There was a city official I wanted to talk to. Bickford hovered with his video camera. The official looked at Bickford and asked me to call her in the morning, she wasn't going to speak with him stationed there. Then Bickford bumped into and tripped me (he said it was an accident) and I went looking for a cop. He hadn't physically hurt me, I didn't fall, but that wasn't the point. No one gets to harass a news reporter physically without facing consequences. No charges were filed and anything police-related between us ended there. He took occasional shots at me on his blog, H.U.S.H. (Holyoke Underground Social Humorists), his online presence delivered under the screen name "Pronoblem" or the longer "Pronoblem Francis Baalberith." But Bickford hit others, usually members of the Holyoke City Council, much harder and more often. He said he was exercising his First Amendment rights of free speech. Others said it was harassment. Then Walmart came calling. Officials with the retail giant announced in 2013 they were interested in building a super store on 18 acres on Whiting Farms Road (the site now occupied by a new Gary Rome Hyundai dealership). Bickford became a spokesman for the anti-Walmart group Holyoke First. I went to my editors with word that the guy I'd filed a police report against now was occupying an official position in a big story in the city I cover. We'd had little contact since the October 2011 clash. My editors and I decided I'd contact Bickford and see how that went. I sent him an email. He replied. I told him I didn't like some of the stuff he'd done. He said the same about me. I said I cover Holyoke, I'm not going anywhere. You're spokesman for this group, you're not going anywhere. (I knew he had a family and was committed to Holyoke). I'm willing to try to get along. He said OK. We made an agreement neither of us (to my knowledge) ever broke: Anything said between us, whether in person, on the phone, email or text, was off the record -- meaning neither of us would publish it -- without first talking to the other. Walmart withdrew its plan for Holyoke in September 2013. Bickford became a source, among those I would consult about Holyoke issues: Who will win this council race? Will this ballot question pass? Can Jeff Stanek (and then) Fran O'Connell beat Morse in the election for mayor? What are you hearing? We never hung out or even had a cup of coffee together. Our paths crossed most often at City Hall and Stop & Shop. Mostly we talked about the endless upkeep in owning a house, different kinds of tea, the lure of reel-to-reel tape players, science fiction movies and books. He seemed to have read everything. I told him once I was considering reading "Dune" by Frank Herbert. The 565-page thickness was making me pause. Bickford looked at me. "I read that when I was a teen-ager," he said. Then he explained why it was a good read and how Herbert had mixed an elaborate science fiction story with an ecological focus. I read it and liked it, though so far have skipped Bickford's recommendation to read also Herbert's follow up to "Dune." The last time I saw Bickford was at Stop & Shop on Lincoln Street the Saturday night of Celebrate Holyoke last month. I wasn't able to attend the event. He said he'd just been there and had helped in booking a Latino band to perform. He was sporting an odd haircut, kind of a low-running mohawk down the middle with buzz-cut sides. He rubbed his head and said (sheepishly, it seemed to me) he'd let his daughter cut his hair. I told him I thought it looked cool. Bickford broke stories on his blog. These included stories about Stanek and O'Connell during their mayoral campaigns, stories that got a lot of attention and which The Republican, doing our own research, followed and published. I'm not defending or condemning how he portrayed people. And this is said with the knowledge that there is a Bickford-cooked photo out there doctored to make me look like a hobbit, along with cracks he published about my work. So to those offended by what they considered to be Bickford's ridicule, the question that arises is, OK, so what should be done? One option is to ridicule the ridiculer. Launch your own website. Use your free speech and expression to counter his. But if your answer in such cases is to summon the government -- the courts or some elected or appointed board or the police -- to stop the speech or expression that upsets you, do you still reserve the right to be shocked when the next one the government shuts up is you? A memorial service is scheduled for Bickford on Friday, Sept. 16, 2016 from 5 to 6 p.m. at Holyoke City Hall at High and Dwight streets.

(WIAT) — People are dumping their trash behind the Walmart. Even though, that could cost you jail time and hundreds of dollars in fees. You can see full trash bags ripped open, mattresses, toilets, all piling up attracting bugs. People living around here say it’s a sham this is what this properties turned into after being a main shopping location in the city. Napoleon Sims said, “With Walmart closed, that was sort of the life of Fairfield and Midfield, now that they are gone and people are using it as a junk site, that’ll take the whole community down even further.” CBS42 spoke with Fairfield police, they say they know there’s a problem and apparently the public works department should be cleaning it up in the next few weeks. There is talk the city could be putting up some sort of fence or gate. But, attempts to contact the city, public works and Walmart were all unsuccessful.

(Jason Ivester/The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette via AP) comments Four out-of-state billionaires — including the Wal-Mart heirs and Michael Bloomberg — and two New York lobbying groups have pumped in most of the $11.5 million raised this year for ballot Question 2 to lift the cap on charter schools, while three major teachers’ unions have doled out $6.7 million to keep the cap, campaign finance reports show.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obituaries E-Edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds Member Rewards log in Site Archive Peoria Stadium's future subject of community meeting Sept. 20 Thursday Sep 15, 2016 at 9:49 PM Pam Adams Journal Star education reporter @padamspam PEORIA — Darryll Smith kicks at the weeds growing out of the crumbling track at Peoria Stadium, and points to the roped-off crumbling bleachers on the visitors’ side of the football field. “I don’t want my place looking like this.” As far as Smith is concerned, the stadium site is his place and the football field is, as he puts it, “my yard.” While Peoria Public Schools board members and administrators struggle with the costs of maintaining the stadium, Smith is part of the small crew of groundskeepers that actually maintains it. He’s the kind of man who takes special pride in the well-kept nooks and crannies of his yard, the one who typically paints the white lines on green grass almost weekly during football season. “I hope they don’t get rid of this place,” he said Thursday, shortly after preparing the field for a junior varsity game between his alma mater, Peoria High School, and Peoria Notre Dame. “I played here, my kids played here, now my grandkids are trying to play here. For me to work here, that’s really nice.” The stadium’s future is the subject of a community meeting from 6 until 8 p.m. Tuesday in the stadium concession area. The meeting begins with tours of the site and includes an overview of the uses and maintenance costs by both PPS, its owner, and Peoria Park District, which holds a long-term lease on about 32 acres of the 82-acre property. The last hour of the two-hour meeting is a brainstorming session about potential uses. The public can RSVP and complete a short survey on the district’s website, psd150.org. Previous estimates put the cost of renovating the stadium at between $1 million and $3 million. Though that’s less than developing athletic fields at both Peoria High and Manual Academy, the district is well into an earlier administration’s plans for each high school to have its own athletic fields. Selling the stadium would have generated the necessary revenue. But with the death of a controversial proposal to sell the site to Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the district is caught between two strategies — renovating the stadium or completing plans for athletic fields at the two high schools. Private talks and a social media campaign urging Notre Dame to buy the stadium didn’t get much beyond the discussion stage. The Tuesday meeting is the first public meeting about the stadium’s future organized by the district. If the district is pitching a sales tax referendum for air conditioning and other repairs for almost half the schools, “how can they afford athletic complexes at three different high schools,” asks Adam White. White, owner of Running Central, has talked to dozens of people for the past six weeks to gauge interest in razing the old stadium and replacing it with a new multi-use facility, including a covered grandstand and turf field, that could draw a regional audience for a wide range of recreational and sporting activities, from football to lacrosse, soccer and track and field. “The only way this can be done right is a public-private partnership,” White said. “The business community and donors have to be part of the equation.” Homeowners who live near the stadium site have a vested interest in what happens there. “Our main concern is that the Wal-Mart proposition doesn’t resurface, or anything that resembles that,” said Ron Budzinski, president of The Knolls Homeowners Association. Peoria City Councilman Tim Riggenbach, who represents the 3rd District where the stadium is located, said a comprehensive traffic study has to accompany any plans for the site. The nearby intersection of North Knoxville Avenue and East War Memorial Drive is one of the most heavily used in the city. Residents have made it pretty clear that maintaining the green space is a priority, he added. Smith has his own low-cost ideas to improve the stadium. “For me it’s more than a green space,” Smith said. Every day he comes to work, he remembers the pieces of his soul in different places. He can head straight to the point on lane 5 of the track where he broke the 100-meter record in 1983. A former quarterback, he knows the key to the field’s “Peoria advantage” is in the way it crowns between the 20-yard lines. “Without it, I don’t know where I’d be. It kept me out of the streets.” He recalls the Chicago high school football team that kept sitting on the grass, rubbing it. He couldn’t understand until their coach explained the kids had never played on real grass before. And he knows exactly what led to football’s demise and the subsequent decline of the stadium, from attendance to the crumbling bleachers. “What hurt us was those four state championships.” He’s referring to basketball, not football, and Manual’s string of state championships in the 1990s. Every kid wanted to play basketball after that, he said. But football’s coming back, he added, because of the success of Peoria High and Notre Dame teams. He estimates about 4,200 people attended the game between Peoria High and Richwoods High School two weeks ago. “It was like old times again.”   Pam Adams is the Journal Star education reporter.

Arkansas Blog Archives | RSS « Chris Christie will join Donald Tru…  |  Asa Hutchinson: "It's up to Arkansa… » Saturday, February 27, 2016 The Donald Trump show in Bentonville Posted By David Ramsey on Sat, Feb 27, 2016 at 12:08 PM Donald Trump, an insult comic with possibly fascist leanings who is the current GOP frontrunner for president, is holding a rally in Bentonville today. You can watch the livestream here. UPDATE: Trump (with an assist from Chris Christie) lobbed lots of insults at Rubio. They said he was a little guy with a little mouth and big ears who sweats a lot and never shows up to work. "I'm a strong guy," Trump said, explaining that he almost had to catch the tiny, fresh-mouthed Rubio because he thought he would faint. And so on.  "We gotta win Arkansas," Trump said. "Maybe I'll start shopping permanently at Walmart if we win Arkansas."  Trump barely talked about policy, other than to say that he wanted to change libel laws so that he could be more aggressive in suing the media if they dared to write mean stuff about him. Also this: "We should have a new Air Force One, it's very old." And you may have heard — he wants to build a wall along the Mexican border and make Mexico pay for it. Trump was much more interested in talking about the minutia of his personal finances and various pieces of pending litigation. On and on, like a drunk uncle over-sharing. Trump said that he might ask the judge handling the fraud case regarding his scam school, Trump University, to recuse himself. Trump mentioned the judge's ethnicity twice ("he's Hispanic, which is fine"). Later, Trump asked if there were any Hispanics in the crowd. Pointing, he said: "There's a Hispanic. In Arkansas, we have about three [Hispanics]. And that's okay." My real-time responses in the liveblog below (after the jump), including my confused conclusions about what Trump's fans want and the cult of personality that he projects.  LIVEBLOG:   The Trump plane has arrived. The cult of personality vibe of seeing his name in giant letters on a plane is, well, here you go:  click to enlarge Trump and Christie have arrived. Only half an hour late.  Christie says, "We need Arkansas to be big and strong for Donald Trump." Christie says that Rubio "doesn't work at all." Slams him for never showing up for Senate committee meetings. "Hey Marco, show up for work," he says. He says that Rubio has missed 80 percent of committee meetings. Does anyone care about this line of attack? I doubt it.  Christie to Rubio: "Unlike the U.S. Senate, president of the United States is not a no-show job, so you're not qualified." Missing senate meetings is kind of a meh attack, but I think the idea is to keep peddling the argument that Rubio is a lightweight who isn't ready. That might work with some older GOP based voters on the fence and Christie is a good surrogate to give some substantive heft to Trump's insult routine.  Christie on the debates: "When the pressure is on, Donald Trump fought like a man." By contrast, "You saw what happened to Rubio. He melted." Trump is a manly man and Rubio is a girly girl. This is the strategy that I guess works to rally the GOP base. So there you go. What a country.  Trump says politicians are "all talk, no action." He calls Rubio a "lightweight" — "little mouth on him, bing bing bing bing."  Trump: "I borrowed a tiny amount of money — I borrowed a million dollars." Trump talks about polls, a lot. He complains that we're losing and that companies are moving to Ireland ("Ireland!"). He says unemployment isn't 5 percent, like those weirdo statisticians at the Department of Labor say. Really, it's 25 percent.  "I will address little Rubio," he says. "This guy has a fresh mouth, he's a nasty guy." Trump says Rubio is an even bigger liar than Cruz.  Trump and Christie are obsessed with the debate in which Rubio awkwardly repeated himself. They've said various versions of the word meltdown a dozen times.  Trump's fascistic instincts: He says that when he's president, he's going to change libel laws so that he can more easily sue the media for stories they write about him. "We're going to open up the libel laws so we can sue the media and get damages. It'll be amazing how honest they become."  Trump says he's never seen a human being sweat so much as Rubio. "Thank God he has such big ears to catch all that sweat," he says. Trump says that Rubio was so sweaty and nervous, he thought he was going to faint. "I'm a pretty strong guy, I got ready to grab him," Trump says. "I thought he was going to go down."  Trump says that Rubio sweats so much it looks like he's just coming out of a swimming pool and Rubio puts on so much makeup it's like he's "putting it on with a trowel." These are stale jokes from yesterday.  Trump says that the reason that he's beating Rubio by 20 points in Florida is because Florida voters "can't stand the guy."  "We gotta win Arkansas," Trump says. "Maybe I'll start shopping permanently at Walmart if we win Arkansas." Trump's core message: "Politicians are never going to get you to the promised land."  He notes that he got into Wharton because he's so smart. He says he'll say crazy stuff as president. "They'll say it's unpresidential but I don't care," he says.  Trump is so much more comfortable talking about his finances and pending litigation than he is about policy or even politics. He loves talking about the micro-details, like, the statute of limitations on some legal fight over real estate or the labor market in Palm Springs or some sleazebag trying to shake him down over a casino deal or whatever. He just told a very convoluted story about some lawsuit he's fighting — honestly, I didn't follow the details — and said "this is more interesting than talking about trade." He's like a drunk uncle over-sharing. Trump just said he was before a judge "who's Hispanic, which is fine."  Later: "There's a Hispanic. In Arkansas, we have about three [Hispanics]. And that's okay."  Trump says "little Rubio" got a sweetheart deal on selling his house to a lobbyist.  "I'm so non-litigious, it's amazing," he says. Very little policy in this speech but at the end, Trump runs through a list: build a wall in Mexico, repeal and replace Obamacare, protect the Second Amendment, some incoherent stuff about trade. And change libel laws so he can shut mean journalists up. Plus this: "We should have a new Air Force One, it's very old."  Ted Cruz? He's a Canadian, Trump says. On the other hand, Trump says he likes General MacArthur and General Patton. Trump says "waterboarding is great, but we have to go stronger." Here is why I can never really understand what's going on in the GOP primaries, why I can never quite relate: So much of this stuff is about expressions of masculinity that have such a sad, sad, sad, sad "protest too much" feel to them that it's hard for me to take it seriously. If someone constantly talks about how tough and manly he is and how everyone else is not tough and manly enough, it's hard not to laugh. Because it's laughable. That's uncharitable, I know, but it's funny! My understanding of this Trump rally is that the wild fear and the deep crisis of masculinity runs so deeply for a subset of the GOP base that Trump's strongman routine registers not as a joke, not as a depressing late-night Vegas act, not as an overwritten SNL routine, not as creeping crypto-fascism — but as virile salvation.  click to enlarge Tweet Instapaper Share Favorite Saving… Comments (52) Email   Sort Oldest to Newest Newest to Oldest Most Liked Comments (52) Showing 1-50 of 52 Add a comment   Subscribe to this thread: By Email Subscribing… With RSS Showing 1-50 of 52 Comment Add a comment Subscribe to this thread More by David Ramsey Democrats' last stand in NE Arkansas Nate Looney vs. Rep.

At the time, directors Eduardo Sanchez and Daniel Myrick forged fresh ground with an approach so raw, ragged and cheap, it suspended our disbelief like no fiction before it. The technique was shrewdly simple: amateurish, wobble-and-thrash camcorder cinematography previously seen in every home movie ever made, but no one was savvy enough to capitalize on yet. It's the essence of do-it-yourself filmmaking – use mom's credit card to buy a camera at Wal-Mart, strap it on and go. As for proper lighting? Framing? Acting? Writing? Surely, you jest. And as happens in the wake of such innovation, copycats began flooding screens big and small with faux-found footage horror stories that show a toe or elbow of the spectre, demon or zombie that's murdering dirt-stupid teenagers, thus saving on budget and rightly assuming that what we don't see, and therefore imagine in our own irrational minds, is often scarier than a state-of-the-art makeup or CGI job. The "Blair Witch Project" imitators quickly grew tiresome and irksome, and the shaky cam more gruesome than any monstrous antagonist. A dashed-off meta-sequel, 2000's "Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2," gamely attempted a different approach, and its self-referential tone was rejected outright as a creative failure, and the film was quickly disowned by everyone, even diehard horror mavens who will sit through any feature with a slashy font on the poster and a few gallons of red corn syrup. Which leads us to this new "Blair Witch," which follows the original film chronologically, and returns to the tried, true, very tired form. The conceit is more complicated, and therefore more contrived. James (James Allen McCune) is the brother of Heather, the iconic close-up hyperventilator from the first movie. After whatever happened to her at story's end, no trace of her was found, even by search parties. Banking on a blurry clue in a YouTube video, James believes he can find his long-lost sibling in the dreaded Black Hills Woods, which are steeped in folklore about an 18th-century persecuted witch haunting anyone who dares wander the trails. His friend Lisa (Callie Hernandez) is following his story for her documentary class project. They recruit friends Peter (Brandon Scott) and Ashley (Corbin Reid) for a camping trip, with local Blair Witch experts Lane (Wes Robinson) and Talia (Valorie Curry) eventually tagging along. Which totals six eggs in this twit omelet, likely soon to be devoured by whatever moaning ghoul lurks among the trees in search of a tender, gullible breakfast. 'Sully' review: Tom Hanks is remarkable, as usual, in typically sobering Clint Eastwood drama To underscore the technological advancements of the last 18 years, the core four are outfitted with earpiece cams and a drone, and even Lane drags along his video camera. So that's five amateur cinematographers giving us the same first-person blur of trees and dirt illuminated only by a flashlight with fickle battery power, and soundtracked with much, much yelling. The first night in the woods, they're greeted by immense howling noises and the sounds of large tree limbs cracking, coming from both nowhere and everywhere. They wake to find weird twig-totems hanging around the site, and decide enough is enough. But the path out leads them through an apparent fracture in the space-time continuum, and right back to the same spot for another night of unwise solo treks into the foliage for firewood and private urination. It was then I noticed the sharp metallic squeak of a theater chair a few spots down the row, integrating itself into the picture, inadvertently upstaging the action on the screen, which began to resemble the stock slasher films in which pinheaded mortals are picked off one at a time by a lurking plot device. But hey, at least Jason Voorhees adhered to most laws of physics (save for the one about staying dead once you're no longer alive), therefore establishing at least a rudimentary set of "rules" for the narrative. "Blair Witch" shows no interest in such things. It throws one vague, random supernatural phenomenon after another at its protagonists, begging us to describe it as suggestive horror instead of conceptual slop. This might be forgivable if director Adam Wingard ("The Guest," "You're Next") employed more of the vivid imagery of the film's final moments, set in a house that seems to have crawlspaces beneath crawlspaces, and attics atop attics. His use of lightning flickers and cramped interiors finally conjures the suffocating intensity "Blair Witch" needs to transcend the clichés of this ramshackle subgenre.

Read today's eNewspaper News Maryland Baltimore City Plank's $5.5 billion Port Covington plan advanced quietly, then loudly Final vote is expected for Port Covington The city is planning a final vote for approving the development of Port Covington for Under Armour's Kevin Plank. (Baltimore Sun video) The city is planning a final vote for approving the development of Port Covington for Under Armour's Kevin Plank. (Baltimore Sun video) Luke Broadwater and Natalie ShermanContact ReportersThe Baltimore Sun In buying Port Covington, developers hid ties to Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank. A large waterfront parcel in Port Covington sold for $2 million in 2012 to an investor who declined to identify himself. Then a second large property sold nearby. Then a third. Each time, the investor's identity was hidden behind hard-to-trace limited liability companies. Speculation abounded. Who was the mystery buyer? What was being planned in South Baltimore? Keisha Allen, head of the nearby Westport Neighborhood Association, fired off a letter to her city councilman that foreshadowed the fights to come. "'When it's time to sit down with this developer … you need to make sure we have a seat at the table,'" Allen recalled writing. "I knew it was going to be big. I just didn't know it was going to be that big."

Plank's Sagamore Development Co. has come out of the shadows and launched an unprecedented campaign, pushing for a $5.5 billion redevelopment, home of a new headquarters campus for the nation's No. 2 sports apparel company.

Officials including Comptroller Joan M. Pratt and City Council President Bernard C. "Jack"... (Luke Broadwater) After the secretive start, plans for the development have advanced publicly and loudly. On Monday, the Baltimore City Council is poised to give final approval to $660 million in bonds that would pay for public infrastructure in Port Covington, where Sagamore plans restaurants, shops, housing and manufacturing space. The developer would have to repay the bonds through future taxes. The decision, like a preliminary vote last week, is expected to go heavily in Under Armour's favor. Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake has said she would sign legislation authorizing the bonds. Some observers marvel at how efficient Plank's team has been at winning over community members, religious groups and politicians since announcing the redevelopment in early 2016. Even other Baltimore businessmen — who sometimes fight over whether each other's projects would cannibalize the market — have enthusiastically endorsed Port Covington. "I can sum up my feelings in one word: It's a miracle," said real estate developer David S. Cordish, the man behind Maryland Live Casino. "It's a miracle for Baltimore City that Under Armour is here. It's a miracle that Kevin Plank is steering the ship. Port Covington is just the latest gift that we're garnering as citizens of this city from this miracle." While Plank has not personally attended City Council hearings on the issue — his staff said he's occupied running Under Armour, which brought in nearly $4 billion in revenue last year — his development team is acting on his wishes, said Tom Geddes, the CEO of Sagamore parent company Plank Industries. "He's given his input on planning and design. He's given direction for robust community benefits," Geddes said of Plank. "This is definitely his vision. The commitment to the city comes from him." Rapid growth The pace of Under Armour's growth has been rapid. Plank launched the company from his grandmother's basement in Washington, D.C., in 1996, before moving to Baltimore. After outgrowing a few smaller spots, Under Armour set up shop in the Tide Point complex in Locust Point, recalled developer Bill Struever, who previously owned the former detergent plant that serves as the brand's headquarters. "They had a little place in Camden-Carroll when they were just getting started," Struever said. "It wasn't too long ago they were just a few people." Even then, other cities were trying to lure Under Armour away, said M.J. "Jay" Brodie, who as longtime chief of the Baltimore Development Corp. tried to find a home for Plank's company. "They were clearly being wooed by other cities," Brodie said. "We thought it was very important they find a future home in Baltimore." In 2008, the company projected that it would outgrow its Tide Point headquarters in about five years. Company officials considered moves to other sites — including an industrial swath of the Middle Branch called West Covington and an expansion in Locust Point, near its current headquarters — but business and property owners fought those efforts. "They were trying to do acquisitions, but the process became stalled with politics and zoning," said Marc Weller, Sagamore Development's president, who previously worked in the Washington real estate market. "There was an unwillingness of certain tenants to sell at prices that were reasonable. Kevin called me out of the blue, and said, 'Marc, I'd really like to talk with you about the future of Under Armour.'" Eager to stay in Baltimore, Under Armour officials printed out aerial maps of the city to look for open space. "It became incredibly obvious Port Covington was ripe for development," Weller said. Said Geddes: "Kevin was really attracted to the idea there was no risk of displacing people from their homes." But to make the plan work, they needed to move quickly and quietly, the developers said. If sellers believed the properties were needed for an Under Armour campus, they likely would jack up the price, Weller said. "The use of names and addresses that didn't tie back to Kevin was all very intentional," Weller said. "We wanted to be successful in acquiring as much as possible as quickly as possible." Companies discreetly owned by Plank purchased his first Port Covington property at a foreclosure auction. A Plank-owned whiskey distillery is now under construction on that site. His second purchase, 101 W. Dickman St., reopened last year as the City Garage incubator and event space. The third, a roughly $35 million deal revealed in January 2014 that included a Walmart and a former Sam's Club building, made it clear that someone was assembling property in the area. Later that year, a Plank entity bought a 60-acre property there that includes the site of The Baltimore Sun's printing plant from the newspaper's former parent, Tribune Media, for $46.5 million, more than twice the $21 million it was valued for tax purposes. The Sun has a long-term lease for the property. As its plans moved forward, Sagamore continued to consolidate its hold on the area, negotiating rights of way and ground rents, and picking up many of the remaining parcels, including six rowhouses that sit in the shadow of Interstate 95 on West McComas Street. Some of those residents, like Joseph Meyers and his wife, Sandra, are now Plank tenants. They said they have confidence in their new landlord, pointing to freshly cut grass and flowers that now dress up the block. The transition occurred as Sandra Meyers was diagnosed with cancer, and the couple credits Sagamore with relocating them to a better property on the block and accommodating the strain on their finances. "We'd be on the street right now if it wasn't for them," said Joseph Meyers, 55. "When I see that stuff on TV about whether they'll take care of people — I know they will." Businessman Russell Johnson, the former president of Atlantic Forest Products, was involved in the sale of a parcel to Sagamore last year. He said Weller's approach was preferable to past efforts to develop the area. In 2008, when the city proposed to take properties in the area by eminent domain, some businesses lawyered up and blocked the attempt, Johnson said. "His whole approach was much different, much better," Johnson said of Weller. "I think that kind of changed the business owners in that area to 'Let's talk to these people.'" In an interview with The Sun last year, Plank said his interest in real estate was first piqued by a conversation with Orioles owner Peter Angelos. "I'm not going to have a great campus unless I have a great city that surrounds it," Plank said. "We're not saying Baltimore needs Under Armour but Under Armour can certainly help Baltimore. ... Individually I don't think this land is particularly valuable, but when you put them all together and you have the assemblage in one place and the ability to literally paint a vision, the land gets exponentially more valuable." He added: "When people drive through Baltimore [on I-95] I literally want them to drive through and go, 'There's Baltimore on the right. There's Under Armour on the left.'" 'Better communicators than the city' But Plank couldn't accomplish his vision without community and political support. Plank representatives spent hours meeting with business and community groups as well as political leaders across the city, courting their support. Some came around slowly, while others, such as the Downtown Partnership, quickly rallied, citing Under Armour's importance to the city. His team launched an advertising campaign to influence public opinion that analysts estimate has cost more than $1 million — including more than $500,000 in television and radio commercials, plus advertising in The Sun and a robust social media presence. When details of the plan started to trickle out, businesses in the area were on alert for signs that the development might cause problems the way residential growth in other industrial zones had, said Rusty Erdman, chair of the South Baltimore Business Alliance, a coalition of largely industrial firms. "There was polite dancing and posturing at the table to try to figure things out. Were we their enemy or were we their advocate? There was some head bumping at the beginning," he said. "We'd have loved to have seen it stay completely industrial, sure, but that's not a reality anymore. I think this is really a win-win for the city overall." Steven A. Siegel, executive vice president of Sagamore, said plans for the development have evolved as community members provided feedback. He said the developers went on a kayaking tour of the South Baltimore waterfront to better understand the area's trash and pollution problems and to brainstorm ways to clean it up. "We started with our neighbors and incorporated ideas," he said. After weeks of meetings with community associations near Port Covington, such as those for Cherry Hill and Westport, a $39 million community benefits agreement was reached with six neighborhoods near the project. But as the size of Sagamore's bond request sank in, a larger citywide fight over the public financing broke out. Community and labor activists led by the nonprofit BUILD questioned whether Plank planned to build yet another white, upper-class enclave using city money without helping the rest of the city. Even as activists publicly voiced skepticism and opposition to the project, they joined city officials in negotiating with Sagamore and, this month, a $100 million citywide benefits agreement was announced. The deal includes $25 million to train workers at a new Port Covington training center and $10 million in no-interest loans or other funding streams for minority- and women-owned startups. Allen, of Westport, said the six South Baltimore neighborhoods were determined to strike a deal with Plank that benefited the community. She said poor and middle-class people were left out of previous development deals, like the one the city struck with the developer of Harbor Point. She praised Sagamore, saying they had been "better communicators than the city." "Some residents and some elected officials have pretty much deemed us redheaded stepchildren of the city. We don't get resources trickling down here," Allen said. Now, "people no longer take us as a joke." The developers have agreed to hire at least 30 percent of all infrastructure construction workers from Baltimore, pay at least $17.48 an hour, and set aside 20 percent of housing units for poor and middle-class families, though 40 percent of that housing may be built elsewhere in the city. Critics call the affordable housing agreement weak. It requires 10 percent of Port Covington's affordable units to be built for people who make less than $26,000, and contains what critics call a "loophole" that allows the developer to pay money into a fund instead of building the units. And they argue that a subsidized development should pay "prevailing wages" — several dollars higher than proposed — on all construction jobs, and living wages thereafter. Charly Carter, director of Maryland Working Families, a progressive political organization protesting the tax deal, said the community benefits agreement isn't as good as it sounds. "When you unpack the numbers in this $100 million proposal, it's just not there," she said. "They have the ability to buy their way out of affordable housing very cheaply. There are no guarantees about permanent jobs. ... If we are investing our money, we should invest in good-paying jobs." Geddes said the development team has tried to be as inclusive as possible. "There's no way to make everybody happy," he said. "There are economic realities. The line we have to walk is between maximum inclusivity on the one hand and economic viability on the other." Baltimore officials, including Rawlings-Blake, are happy. She said the city has engaged in efforts to keep Under Armour in Baltimore for years. And she's impressed with the way communities near Port Covington have advocated for themselves. "I'm pleased the plans are moving at a good pace from dreams to reality," Rawlings-Blake said. "The city is making significant investments to make this project happen. At the end of the day, we all benefit." lbroadwater@baltsun.com nsherman@baltsun.com twitter.com/lukebroadwater twitter.com/shermannatalie Privacy Policy Copyright © 2016, The Baltimore Sun, a Baltimore Sun Media Group publication | Place an Ad Kevin Plank Housing Market Real Estate Under Armour Port Covington Tide Point Waterfront Park M.J.

Share story By Janet I. Tu Seattle Times business reporter On a recent weekday evening, Rebecca Harrell tasted some roasted tomato pasta salad at PCC Natural Markets’ new Bothell location and surveyed the expanse of produce, the prominent prepared-foods bars and the checkout counters off to the side. Compared to the co-op’s Kirkland location, she said, “This one is a lot more airy, open — it’s easier to find things.” Harrell, 24, moved to the Puget Sound area about two years ago from Cheney, Spokane County, and hadn’t even heard of the co-op before that. But these days, she’s been impressed enough that she stops in regularly at the Bothell store for a snack before her workout at a nearby gym.

Harrell represents a group the 11-store natural foods co-op is trying to reach in these days of explosive population growth in the area: newcomers who may not know much, if anything, about the 63-year-old co-op. And the Bothell store, which opened in July, represents the direction the co-op is heading at a time when grocery-store competition is also growing more intense. Sales of natural and organic foods nationwide are rising faster than for conventional food, drawing more players into a field once solely the province of grocers such as PCC. Smaller-format stores that emphasize natural foods, including 365 by Whole Foods Market and New Seasons Market, are making their way into the Seattle area. Meanwhile, conventional stores such as Fred Meyer and Wal-Mart, as well as warehouse giants including Costco and Sam’s Club, are carrying more organic products. “This puts pressure on chains like PCC to continue its level of differentiation,” said Neil Stern, retail analyst at McMillanDoolittle, a retail-consulting firm. PCC, the nation’s largest natural-foods retail co-op, “certainly has tremendous credibility,” said Stern. “It was local before local was big.” What’s more, he said, “The co-op model creates a deep bond … with the consumer that is difficult for other chains to replicate. “The challenge,” Stern added, “will be to keep the brand relevant for the next generation of consumers who may not be as familiar with their heritage.” PCC is aware of the challenges, said Cate Hardy, PCC’s CEO, in a recent interview at the co-op’s headquarters in Belltown, where it had recently moved after years in the University District. Hardy took the helm at PCC early last year after nine years at Starbucks, where she had been vice president of operations. Under Hardy’s leadership, staff say, the co-op has been willing to experiment more — and to be more consistent about trying to replicate the successful experiments in other stores. For instance, the Columbia City store, which opened last year, tried two new prepared-foods concepts: a taqueria and a noodle-bowl bar. After six months, it became clear the taqueria was a hit and noodle bowls were not. So the store stopped selling noodle bowls, while PCC explored replicating the taquerias. The Bothell store opened with a taqueria, and the Issaquah store will have one when it is remodeled. The Bothell store is also the site of other experiments: moving cash registers toward the perimeter of the store so they’re not the first thing people see when they walk in. Rather, fresh produce is — more like “walking into the farmers market,” Hardy said. Its kitchen has been opened up so people can see staff working on preparing food from scratch — highlighting the store’s culinary roots, and acknowledging how important prepared foods have become to grocery-store sales these days. “Honestly, I don’t think we get enough credit for how much care and craft goes into our prepared foods,” Hardy said. “You can walk into any grocery store and walk out with a tub of something. But we’re distinctive in culinary.” There’s a rotisserie there too — something PCC used to have but had gotten away from. “We’re iterating,” Hardy said. “Every store we open is getting closer to where we’re going next.” PCC also recently partnered with delivery services Instacart and Amazon Prime Now, with customers able to select items online and have them delivered within two hours. It’s still less than 5 percent of PCC’s business but it’s growing, Hardy said, and an important part of reaching new customers. The co-op is also experimenting on a project with Instacart, in which customers reading a PCC recipe online for skillet lasagna can click on a button to put all the ingredients for the recipe into their Instacart basket. Those kinds of changes and experiments are needed, since “organic is no longer a niche market,” said Tom Murphy, global retail and consumer packaged-goods lead for North Highland, a consulting firm. Food co-ops are no longer competing just with other grocers but also with restaurants and delivery services from restaurants for “stomach space,” Murphy said. The PCC markets, which “have the products but don’t have the scale and supply chain to do the last-mile delivery,” are smart to partner with the delivery services, he believes. “I don’t know if they’ll start to rent space on drones but who knows.” But even as PCC makes these changes, Hardy says its core values and practices remain the same: a focus on high-quality foods, high standards for sourcing, transparent labeling and concern for workers. PCC’s employees, of which there are some 1,500 now in several cities across the region, all make at least the Seattle minimum wage and receive benefits at 28 hours a week. Store staff are unionized. PCC also labels much of its products with information such as “organic” “non-GMO” (genetically modified), “local” and “gluten free.” As a co-op, it’s not beholden to shareholders or funders but to members and the local community, Hardy said. Each PCC location gives, on average, $90,000 a year back to the community. “What we’ve always done is becoming much more mainstream,” she said. “More and more people are becoming more aware of, and concerned about, where food is grown and the treatment of workers. That niche group is becoming more mainstream.” The challenge, though, she said, is how to get that message of what PCC does out to newcomers. “Maybe we’ve had a little bit of Northwest humility around us and assumed the people who care about what we do will find us,” Hardy said. “I think it’s OK to talk to people about who we are and what we do.” Toward that end, the co-op recently hired a vice president of marketing and retained Wexley School for Girls, a branding and ad agency, to “figure out how we can tell our story in a way that is true and authentic,” Hardy said. That challenge is hardly unique to PCC. For years, natural-food co-ops, most of which opened in the 1970s, enjoyed sustained double-digit growth, said C.E. Pugh, chief operating officer of National Co+op Grocers, which serves 150 co-ops nationwide. But now that’s flatlined at about 5 percent growth a year, Pugh said. The turning point was around the early part of this decade, when sales of natural and organic foods began to exceed 10 percent of all retail food sales. That tipping point was when “conventional grocers got serious,” Pugh said. “Once it exceeded that 10 percent threshold, conventional industries said: ‘This is not a fad. This is here to stay. We’d better get committed.’” Now, conventional stores’ share of natural and organic retail sales is at 43 percent, beating the 40 percent market share held by pure-play natural-foods retailers. To jump-start their growth rates again, co-ops simply must “tell our stories better,” Pugh believes. “There’s increasing interest in local, in knowing where food comes from, in transparency. Co-ops excel at that. “For years, we didn’t have to think about ‘how did we grow.’ We had to think about ‘how do we keep up with the growth,’” Pugh said. “We didn’t develop the muscles to tell our stories.” These days, about a third of National Co+op Grocers’ members are seeing strong growth of 10 percent a year or greater, a third have growth in the single digits, and a third are seeing declining sales. PCC is doing well, with annual growth ranging from the high-single to mid-double digits over the past five years. Last year, the company logged $252 million in sales, up 9.6 percent from the year before, with net income of $5.5 million. The co-op says it’s seeing sales growth in the high-single digits for stores open at least a year, and its average sales per square foot is $1,380. Whole Foods, in comparison, logged sales per square foot of $935 in its most recent quarter. Kroger doesn’t disclose its sales per square foot but one research report put it at $672. PCC’s sales figure per square foot is “damn good,” said David Livingston of DJL Research, which provides analysis for supermarkets. “This puts them in probably the top 1 percent of grocers in the USA.” What’s allowed PCC to succeed at a time when other natural-foods retailers are seeing sales slowdowns, said Pugh, of National Co+op Grocers, is that it’s well managed. It’s also benefited over the years from Seattle being “one of the more competitive natural and organic markets in the country,” he said. “So they faced earlier and more sustained competition. It probably influenced their approach to the business.” PCC has also grown earlier and more aggressively than most other co-ops, Pugh said. There’s a 12th PCC location, planned for Madison Valley, and Hardy declined to talk about any future stores that might be in the works. But she did say this: “We are noticing the growth of the city and we want to participate in that … I think there’s more demand for PCC than there are PCCs right now.” Janet I.

"Following" : "Follow"}} September 17, 2016 10:06am   Comments Share: Related KR Watch These 7 Huge Call Purchases In Friday Trade Wall Street's M&A Chatter From November 16 Kroger: A Lesson In Investor Psychology (Seeking Alpha) Last Wednesday, Argus hosted a Retail Conference Call. Among other stocks, Senior Retail Analyst Chris Graja shared a look at Kroger Co (NYSE: KR). Grocery Retail The analyst noted that, while Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE: WMT) has been competing with Kroger in the grocery retail space for quite some time, Target Corporation's (NYSE: TGT) dissatisfaction with its food retail returns have led it to prepare a bigger push in the arena – although this hasn't been confirmed by the company. The Innovation Issue "When you look at the one differentiating factor with Kroger, it's a technology and an innovation thing,” Graja continued. "For many years, they were way in front of just about every retailer in using big data to analyze customer shopping preferences and to offer very targeted coupons. That drives sales, and the thing that it does especially well, is that they can offer you personalized coupons on what you want to buy without going out and advertising in the big circular what the sales are and sparking a price war." The Edge The analyst then went into the various elements that provide Kroger with an edge over other retailers. It’s all about service: a faster check out than big box retailers, lower prices and a more pleasant shopping environment. The other big differentiating issue is Kroger’s “very smart attention to capital,” the expert continued. “What they found is that they can dense up in markets and, by increasing their market share in markets, they're able to leverage their transportation and their marketing expense in those markets. It boosts their return on assets and it boosts the overall return on capital in the company. They're beginning to aggressively deploy capital to do this and to exploit some of those opportunities.” So, What’s Wrong? Despite all of the praises above, shares of Kroger have lost more than 25 percent year-to-date. "The transient issue I think is deflation,” Graja concluded. “That's what's weighing on the stock - deflation and the effect on the top-line. But I think that's largely transient.” Image: Nicholas Eckhart, Flickr Latest Ratings for KR Date Firm Action From To Sep 2016 Jefferies Maintains Hold Sep 2016 Barclays Initiates Coverage on Equal-Weight Sep 2016 Citigroup Maintains Buy View More Analyst Ratings for KR View the Latest Analyst Ratings Posted-In: Argus Chris GrajaAnalyst Color Long Ideas Analyst Ratings Trading Ideas Best of Benzinga © 2016 Benzinga.com.

On Sept. 9, exactly 45 years to the day after the uprising at the Attica Correctional Facility in New York, prisoners across the United States went on strike. The full scope of the protests is unclear, in part because of the lack of media coverage. But what is evident is that prisoners in as many as 24 states including Alabama, South Carolina and Texas took part in simultaneous nonviolent protests to demand basic human rights. Some inmates were striking to demand clean water, others to protest the excessive use of solitary confinement. Many were protesting having to work for little or no pay. Across the United States, nearly 900,000 inmates work in prisons. Many are paid only a few cents an hour. The states that choose to not pay incarcerated people at all are all in the South: Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia and Texas. Meanwhile, companies profit from that unpaid labor. Little Sis, a government watchdog group, reported earlier this year that while most Texas inmates work without pay, Texas Correctional Industries, a for-profit corporation operated by the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, generated nearly $89 million in profits in fiscal year 2014. Among the companies that benefit from prison labor are McDonalds, Wal-Mart and Whole Foods. Prisoners at Holman Correctional Facility in southern Alabama's Escambia County, collectively known as the Free Alabama Movement, were among the first to call for collective action against unjust labor conditions. According to reports from inside the prison, all of the inmates "refused to report to their prison jobs without incident. With the rising of the sun came an eerie silence as the men at Holman laid on their racks reading or sleeping. Officers are performing all tasks." Another group that helped to organize the strike was the Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee (IWOC) of the radical Industrial Workers of the World labor union. Prior to the strike, IWOC posted a list of demands from prisoners in South Carolina. Besides calling for an end to unpaid labor, the group also called for the South Carolina Department of Corrections to "stop removing mental health patients from treatment programs back to the general population units for disciplinary infractions" and called for South Carolina parole board decisions to be "grounded in scientific analysis rather than emotions." On the day of the strike, the Perry Correctional Institution in South Carolina's Anderson County was placed on lockdown after at least 10 inmates refused to return to their cells during the strike. According to the IWOC, the inmates faced repercussions because of their actions, with some transferred to other facilities. Inmates at Perry manufacture goods for schools and government agencies and also provide labor for the state, county and local municipalities. All of the prisoners who engaged in the strike were putting themselves at risk. Melvin Ray of the Free Alabama movement remains in solitary confinement after helping to organize a similar strike in 2014. But prisoners like Malik Washington, a spokesperson for the End Prison Slavery in Texas movement, decided to move forward with the strike because they had reached their breaking point. "Prisoners in Amerikan prisons are sick and tired of being degraded, dehumanized, and exploited," Washington wrote in a letter to The Nation reporter John Washington.

Many stores will refund the price difference to you within one or two weeks after your purchase, as long as you remember to ask — but you have to take the time to check for price changes, keep all the receipts, and go through each store's procedure for acquiring a refund. Who has time for that on a daily basis? Nobody does, which is why the Paribus app was invented. Paribus monitors your recent purchases at participating retailers for price drops and automatically works with the stores to secure your refund. When successful refunds are acquired, Paribus keeps 25% as a commission and 75% is returned to your payment card through the retailer. How does it work? You grant Paribus access to your e-mail, and it scans for any receipts that arrive in your inbox. It will note the items you bought and the amount paid for each item, and then scan the store for price changes in those items. The app can also detect coupons and coupon codes that should have been applied to your purchase and ask for the coupon amount to be redeemed retroactively. Among the many retailers included are Amazon, Best Buy, Wal-Mart, Target, Zappo's, J. Crew, Athleta, Staples, and Kohl's. A full listing is available on the Paribus website. The potential downside is in the amount of information you must supply to Paribus. In order for this approach to work, Paribus not only needs access to your e-mail account to search for purchases and price changes, it also needs an available credit card number to charge you for any refunds that it finds. Tracking of Amazon prices requires supplying Paribas with your Amazon login, and other stores may require sharing access codes to allow Paribus access to your account. Security is an obvious concern, but Paribus claims strict security through bank-grade encryption. Granted, your information could be vulnerable to a hack at Paribus, but that is true with many retailers as well. Protect yourself using the obvious security measures, such as not using the same, simple password for all of your online security requests. For those worried about having their purchase history logged, Paribus does not offer gathered information to third parties. They make their money off the per-sale commissions. You have the option to remove individual purchases from the tracking under the "My Purchases" tab. Note that Paribus requires an e-mailed receipt for your online purchases, so make sure that you receive an e-mail receipt for any relevant purchases, and that the address that receives e-mailed receipts is the same one used by Paribus. Paribus supports most web-based e-mail services, but if yours is not included, you can simply set up a separate Gmail account for your Paribus account. If you like, you can open multiple Paribus accounts and assign one to each e-mail address that you have. However, it does not go in both directions — you cannot split your Paribus account between multiple e-mail addresses. As more stores go to dynamic pricing schemes that change prices constantly based on demand algorithms and other analytical methods, the Paribus app should become even more useful. Why not take advantage of all the potential refunds available to you, especially when the amount of effort required on your part is about the same as picking up dollar bills off the sidewalk?

Combining the power of “knowing why and how” and understanding sound scientific principles with practice of active positive outcomes, the webinar focuses on the impact that leaders can have on employee behaviors that drive food safety. CEO of STOP Foodborne Illness Deirdre Schlunegger will be speaking, along with special guests Frank Yiannas, Walmart’s Vice President of Food Safety; Michael Taylor, Freedman Consulting’s Senior Fellow; and Steve Schluneger, Principal of Intrinsic Leadership. “A strong emphasis on food safety culture is emerging, and leadership is critical in creating and maintaining this culture,” Yiannas says. In a world where businesses in the food industry are more aware of being susceptible to foodborne illnesses such as salmonella and the norovirus, the need for a strong food safety culture is more prevalent than ever before. The first line supervisors set the tone for the culture and behavior of employees, and their key note speakers explain how these business leaders can drive effective food safety practices. The program will be recorded. Registration is $129. Sign up today at https://stopfoodborneillness.thankyou4caring.org/webinar?.

Police found the bodies after freeing the woman and arresting Grate.  Griffith who had been missing in Ashland since August 16, was last seen in a Walmart in the town. Stanley was last seen on September 8, with a flat tire at a gas station in Ashland.  The house where the women's bodies were found has been cordoned off with yellow police tape, and two bouquets of sunflowers were placed in front with a teddy bear and a cross with Stanley's name and the message: 'You are loved by many'.

Three years later, Chick-N-Bap has become one of the most popular destinations for students to get food on campus. Sung Kim graduated from BU in 2014 with a degree in business administration. Kim said he got the idea after a night out in Downtown Binghamton left him and a few friends craving something similar to the chicken-over-rice dishes they often enjoyed at home in New York City. The next day, Kim went out and bought all the ingredients for what would become his chicken-over-rice dishes, spending his free time for over a week experimenting with multiple recipes before attaining the taste he wanted. “I went out and got the ingredients from Wal-Mart,” Kim said. “I was broke, this was all of my savings and thank God I got it down. I started taste-testing with my housemates and they kept telling me they would definitely buy the food.” Realizing he had a potential success on his hands, Kim put together a business proposal and approached BU President Harvey Stenger after he gave a presentation in one of Kim’s School of Management classes. Stenger said he liked the pitch and emailed Kim back the next day. Stenger then put Kim in contact with Sodexo, who agreed to let him sell his chicken over rice in Hinman Nite Owl. “How we began was almost like a trial, just a way for the school to support the students,” Kim said. “A way to get the students involved with business and food.” The first weekend Chick-N-Bap was open, Kim said Sodexo only expected him to sell 30 dishes. It was open Friday and Saturday night, and had to shut down service around midnight each day after he ran out of ingredients due to high demand. By the end of the weekend, Kim had sold 600 dishes. After his initial success, Kim was allowed to keep his location in Hinman Nite Owl for the next two semesters, steadily increasing sales. By spring 2015, he and Sodexo moved the operation to the Marketplace for Thursday, Friday and Saturday each week to help supplement the struggling Wholly Habaneros. Once located in the Marketplace, Kim’s business continued to thrive, at its peak selling over 1,800 dishes each weekend. With this growth, Sodexo had to reevaluate their agreement with Kim, as their original agreement left them with many of the operating costs while Kim was pulling in large profits. Jim Ruoff, the Sodexo resident district manager for BU dining services, was part of the group that helped arrange Chick-N-Bap’s change in location as well as reconfigure their agreement. They reached a deal similar to that of other vendors like Tully’s and Moghul, in which Kim covers overhead costs, staffs Chick-N-Bap with BU students and pays Sodexo a percentage of the profits he makes. “Sung was too successful,” Ruoff wrote in an email. “A relationship that was based on a handshake, transparency and mutual respect became too big and it needed to be formalized into a contract with more concrete terms for both parties.” Chick-N-Bap now operates six days a week in the Marketplace. Sung currently lives in Binghamton full time and is working out a distinct business model for Chick-N-Bap so it can be managed even when he is not around. For students such as Sam Anderson, a sophomore majoring in art, Chick-N-Bap has become a staple at BU. “I think the food’s good, the best in the Marketplace,” Anderson said. “I eat here, like, once a day.” Trending #NotMyPresident protest draws hundreds SA vice president for academic affairs resigns BU to begin offering public health program Letter to the editor: Adam Wilkes resignation Locally taught, locally grown RECENT NEWS News Panel examines ways to turn passion for politics into civic engagement News Student Congress 11/17: Interim vice president for academic affairs elected News Binghamton University to add new parking lot for start of fall 2017 semester News Students march in solidarity against North Dakota Access Pipeline News BU vice president of research to lead SUNY Polytechnic as interim president Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

Image Gallery Other Related Content Bob Asmussen's Huddle Up (Week 2, 2016) Big Ten football glance: Lots of games to love CHAMPAIGN — Residing in south Mississippi a few years ago, Carroll Phillips was far from the bright lights that greeted him last Saturday night at Memorial Stadium. The defensive end from Miami knew he wanted to play at a big-time program. Knew he wanted to experience a sellout crowd during a prime-time game like he did with North Carolina in Champaign a week ago. But Copiah-Lincoln Community College was the team he played for at the time. Far from the national stage. “I’m a city guy, but going to Copiah-Lincoln, it’s a small town there,” Phillips said. “There’s nothing but like four buildings there. I had to at least drive 20 minutes just to go get something to eat every day.” His usual stops included Burger King and Wal-Mart. That was about it. “The transition from Miami to Mississippi was a struggle,” Phillips said. “I got adjusted to Mississippi life. Once I got here, it was a big upgrade. I blended right in.” Take any of the starting defensive linemen for Illinois — Phillips and Dawuane Smoot at both ends along with Chunky Clements and Rob Bain at the two tackle spots — and the blend is smooth. Even if all hail from different backgrounds and took different paths to where they are now before Saturday’s 3 p.m. kickoff against Western Michigan at Memorial Stadium. Smoot grew up in the inner city of Columbus, Ohio, before moving to the Columbus suburbs and competing in hurdles in track and field during high school. Bain came to Illinois as an offensive lineman from Bolingbrook and spent the 2012 season — he redshirted during Tim Beckman’s first year — at that position before switching to the defensive line. Clements arrived after suffering a torn ACL in his senior season of high school near Dayton, Ohio, with an uncommon nickname to boot because his first name is Jarrod. “His first day on campus, he said, ‘Call me Chunky,’ ” Bain said. “At first, it catches you off guard, but ever since I’ve known him, if I call him Jarrod, then I’m messing with him. Ever since I’ve known him, that’s his name to me.” And then there is Phillips, the elder statesman of the group at 24 years old. But just call him “Wild Man,” a nickname Phillips first picked up playing youth football in Miami. “It keeps everything interesting with all the personalities we have,” Smoot said. “There’s never really a dull conversation.” ‘A lot of pro potential’ The talk around the four starters does have a common denominator. And that is pro potential. A year after sitting next to Jihad Ward on the couch inside defensive line coach Mike Phair’s central Champaign home and watching the Oakland Raiders select Ward in the second round of the NFL draft, Smoot already is hearing his name as a possible first-round pick next spring. He’s not the only Illini defensive lineman on NFL radars, though. Bain, Clements, Phillips and even fifth-year graduate transfer Gimel President are realistic possibilities to land on an NFL roster next summer, either through the draft or signing as an undrafted free agent. “I think they have a lot of pro potential,” Illinois coach Lovie Smith said. “I’ve made a statement that we should have about five guys that can play at the next level, so that’s pretty good. It’s really early to start talking about stuff like that, but comparing them to guys I’ve seen, these guys have a chance.” Having a coach with two decades of NFL experience in Smith can only add to the confidence the group feels. So can hearing Smith repeatedly say in his first six months on the job that the defensive line is the strength of this year’s team. Bain welcomes the added attention Smith’s praise brings to the front four, but quickly adds it doesn’t change how they prepare. “We just try to come out to work every day and set the tone and be the leaders of the team,” he said. “People say expectations are high, but we welcome that pressure. The guys we have in this group, we thrive off that. We want to be the pacesetters.” ‘We need more sacks’ Never satisfied, it seems, Phillips is quite clear on what he wants to see more of from the defensive line. “More sacks,” he said. “We need more sacks. We’ve got to get to the quarterback and affect the passer.” High standards is an aspect Smith wants from his team. But Illinois enters the third weekend of the season with a Big Ten-best eight sacks, and its average of four is tied for 10th in the country. Phillips, President and Clements each have two, with Phillips corralling a nation-best 61/2 tackles for loss after two games. “Our camaraderie is crazy,” Smoot said. “We’re on the same page at all times.” Joe Spencer knows. The Illinois center has to face off against Clements or Bain along the interior of the line twice a week during practice and worked against them throughout training camp. Ditto for Illinois tackles Christian DiLauro and Austin Schmidt when it comes to Smoot and Phillips. “You get a consistent look from them every time,” Spencer said. “Plus, the tackles are going against some of the best defensive ends in the country. It only helps us.” The defensive line benefited from not having to deal with a new position coach this season because Smith retained Phair, the only assistant coach last season at Illinois who is back with the Illini. Bringing in coaches with defensive pedigrees like Smith and defensive coordinator Hardy Nickerson, however, also was an advantage. “They mesh pretty well,” Nickerson said. “You’ve got a good group. They enjoy being around each other and feed off each other. That’s what makes this such a great thing.” ‘It’s like a brotherhood’ Yes, the defense has room to improve after giving up 48 points against North Carolina. The defensive line is included in that sentiment as well. Linebacker Hardy Nickerson, the team’s leading tackler with 22 stops so far after transferring from California, understands how much a quality defensive line can make a difference at his position. “Even before that, when I came and I watched spring practice, I was like, ‘Man, this is a real defensive line,’ ” the younger Nickerson said. “Any time you play behind a defensive line like this one, it just takes so much pressure off you as a linebacker. You’re just able to run and hit.” Western Michigan comes in with a potent offense and one of the country’s most unheralded wide receivers in Corey Davis. But if Smoot, Bain, Clements and Phillips can effectively disrupt the Broncos’ offensive line and force Broncos quarterback Zach Terrell into making some uncharacteristic throws, Illinois should go into Big Ten play with a winning record. All the while attracting more attention along the way, yet keeping the close connections that are nearly as important to this group as each player’s individual skills. “It’s like a brotherhood,” Bain said. “Me, Smoot and Chunky have all been together for four years now. Carroll, this is his third year. We’ve played a lot of snaps together and gone through a lot of practices and workouts. We’re about as close as you can get.” Sections (4):Illini Sports, Football, Sports, Recruiting More Illini Sports Top of the Morning, Nov. 18, 2016 Big Ten football glance: Who has edge to make College Football Playoff?

No problem; most of us swipe our card without thinking twice, but the criminals could be a step ahead of you. In fact, you don't ever even have to get your card out for them to swipe the information. The latest card cloning case comes out of the Flowood. Three Cuban nationals were arrested after attempting to use the cards at a convenient store. It was discovered that they had 50 cloned cards. Then, we got word from McComb police that they're looking for this trio for using stolen numbers to buy more than a thousand dollars worth of merchandise at Walmart in McComb. "Even if your card has never left your protection, you have statement that people can steal with online banking," noted Better Business Bureau Mississippi CEO John O'Hara. Bottom line, the card never has to leave your hands for you to become a victim. Police and the BBB advise that you keep a close eye on bank statements. Or even consider using a credit versus debit card. "When using a credit card, at least there’s a layer of protection there that you’re paying the credit card company and they can dispute the chargers and possibly get the money back," said O'Hara. "On a debit card that money’s right on your account and could leave you in some big trouble." Card skimmers have been popping up all over the country. The devices are sometimes installed into something as common as the gas station pump. O'Hara at the BBB says criminals are getting smarter. Copyright 2016 MSNewsNow. All rights reserved.

This undated photo provided by the Environmental Protection Agency shows the Raymark property, in Stratford prior to demolition in the 1990s. Photo: Contributed Photo / Contributed Photo Raybestos cleanup plan finalized in Stratford 1 / 1 Back to Gallery STRATFORD — Federal environmental officials and local officials jointly announced this week a comprehensive plan is ready to clean up the century-old legacy of the Raybestos Co., which sold and gave away thousands of cubic yards of soil tainted with asbestos and a cocktail of other harmful and cancer-causing chemicals. The final plan is the latest chapter of a cleanup saga that dates back to 1979, when officials first began to seek a solution to the Raymark waste problem. Raybestos was known as Raybestos-Manhattan, Raymark, and Raytech over the years, among other corporate names. Most officials said the deal was about as good as could have been expected, although some people in town wanted Town Hall to hold out for a complete removal of all of the Raymark material. Town Hall officials note that some years back, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency was reluctant to remove any of the tainted soil. “The town of Stratford will see more economic growth as a result. Importantly, EPA must continue to work with town officials and residents in the implementation of the plan,” said U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., when the decision was announced. The plan calls for the tainted soil, present in dozens of sites, to be brought to the former Raybestos Brakettes softball field on Frog Pond Lane. From there, more than half of it — the most toxic soil — will be sent out-of-state to an approved disposal site. The remainder will be capped over. "Having the EPA invest $95 million in environmental clean-up activities in Stratford will allow the town to address its future with the confidence that residents are protected from past corporate pollution,” said Beth Daponte, Town Council chairwoman. “While the clean-up process will be very difficult for the town, the end result will be a better Stratford going forward." Mayor John Harkins agreed. “This record of decision announced today by the EPA will finally rid Stratford of its toxic Raymark legacy, which has threatened the public health and stunted economic growth in our town for decades,” the mayor said. Officials say that the actual movement of soil will not begin until the fall of 2017. More detailed strategies will have to be worked out for how best to transport the contaminated soil, including the hiring of local contractors to help out with the project, coordination with police and other authorities, and so forth. “Every property has its own challenges, plus, we’ll have to prepare the softball field site,” said Jim Murphy, the EPA’s team leader for community involvement. “This cleanup will be challenging because of all the small sites we’ll be dealing with. But, once we start moving, it will be accomplished in a straightforward manner — we’ll try to inconvenience people as little as possible.” He said that work wouldn’t take place in the evenings. “And we will be meeting with people and with town officials as much as possible to listen to their concerns as much as possible,” he said. “When we were cleaning up the Raybestos factory site, we were putting in 20-hour days, which was problematic for many people in town — there won’t be a repeat of that.” That site, where East Main Street meets the Barnum Avenue Cutoff, is where The Home Depot, Walmart and Shop-Rite now stand - officially known as the Stratford Crossing shopping center. It’s been capped over with a thick layer of asphalt, and monitoring wells were installed to keep track of any subterranean movement of the toxic material. The factory there, which had been in decline for years, was shuttered for good in 1989. Murphy said that the most toxic material — more than half of the total waste that will be excavated — will be transported to a certified disposal site out-of-state. “Some people ask ‘Why don’t you move all of the soil out-of-town,’” he said. “But we are spending taxpayer dollars to do this, and we’ll be entirely in compliance when it’s completed.” Officials say that this phase of the project will cost about $97 million. Earlier parts of the Raymark cleanup included the old factory site as well as the playing field for Wooster Middle School on Lincoln Street, both of which were completed in the 1990s. In all, 100,000 cubic yards of soil will have to be moved jburgeson@ctpost.com Today's Deals Powered by SHOP NOW iLife V1 Robotic Vacuum Cleaner for $98 + free shipping GearBestPosted 23 hr 18 min ago SHOP NOW This Is Your Life Poster for $10 + free shipping That Daily DealPosted 2 hr 44 min ago SHOP NOW Air Hogs Helix Sentinel 720p Video Drone for $128 + free shipping WalmartPosted 20 hr 51 min ago SHOP NOW Goggles4U Prescription Eyeglasses for $1 + $6 s&h Goggles4uPosted 3 hr 13 min ago Most Popular 1 Video shows fight, shootings at Sweet 16 party 2 Next time get a room 3 Teacher’s aide rejects plea bargain in sex case 4 Bridgeport mom stabbed by son is recovering from wounds 5 Arrests made in killing of Stamford man 6 Family fight in car leads to assault on Route 34 7 Water main break closes SB I-95 lane Connecticut Post View Comments © 2016 Hearst Communications, Inc.

The state Attorney General’s Office said former Horry County police detective Tony Large used threats to get several victims in cases he was investigating to commit sexual acts. Large is charged with misconduct in office and third-degree criminal sexual conduct. Prosecutors said Luke Green had a sexual relationship with an informant and sexual contact with a suspect during an arrest. Authorities said Darryl Williams and Todd Cox closed or made inactive cases without investigating them. 2Shooting settlement: The family of a black teen who was shot and killed by a white police officer last year says the city of Portsmouth, Va., has agreed to pay a $1 million settlement. Family spokesman Earl Lewis Jr. said Friday that the teen’s mother has agreed to the figure. William Chapman II, 18, was shot outside a Walmart by former Portsmouth police officer Stephen Rankin. Chapman was suspected of shoplifting when a struggle ensued. Rankin later lost his job. A jury convicted him last month of voluntary manslaughter an recommended a 2½-year prison sentence. 3String of arsons: A man was killed and about two dozen people were driven from their home in a string of fires set within blocks of each other in Chicago early Friday, officials said. At least seven separate fires were reported around 3 a.m., apparently set in alley trash cans that spread to garages and at least one home in the South Side neighborhood, according to officials. A man was found dead inside a garage. A few blocks away, about two dozen people were displaced from their home after a fire in a residential building. No injuries were reported. 4Childhood cancer: Brain cancer is now the deadliest childhood cancer in the U.S., ahead of leukemia, a result of improved leukemia treatment and a frustrating lack of progress on brain cancer. Government statisticians reported the change in rankings Friday, drawing from a review of 15 years of death certificates. “I think most people, when they think of childhood cancer, think of leukemia,” said Sally Curtin of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. “This is kind of a changing of the guard.” Cancer is the fourth leading cause of death for children overall, accounting for about 1 in 10 childhood deaths in 2014. About a quarter these cancer deaths, or 534, were due to brain cancer. There were 445 leukemia deaths. Accidental injuries remained the leading cause of death for those under 19, followed by suicide and murder, according to the report. 5Fish theft: City leaders in Villa Rica, Ga., are casting a wide net, hoping to catch a group of fish thieves suspected of making off with up to eight koi fish that cost up to $3,000 each. Police say the fish vanished from a city-owned pond last month outside the Pine Mountain Gold Museum, which showcases the city’s role in Georgia’s gold mining history.

Carlson, hcarlson@postbulletin.com Sep 16, 2016 (…) submitted Levi Dahl, Freeborn County escapee An inmate temporarily released from jail so he could undergo surgery on his leg disappeared from a Rochester hospital this morning before undergoing the procedure. An arrest warrant has been issued for Levi Troy Dahl. He was wearing a GPS bracelet at the time he took off. That bracelet was found this morning in a Rochester Walmart parking lot, according to Todd Earl, a chief deputy with the Freeborn County Sheriff's Office. "I guess he felt it was better to have his freedom than a fixed leg because I'm sure he is in a lot of pain," Earl said. Dahl was arrested in Freeborn County on Sept. 6 for criminal vehicular operation, fleeing a police officer and reckless driving, according to a news release from the Freeborn County Attorney's Office. He made his first court appearance on Sept 8 and bail was set at $75,000. On Thursday, the court approved a prosecutor's motion to temporarily release Dahl from the Freeborn County Adult Detention Center for "humanitarian reasons" so that he could have surgery on his leg. The court also approved the prosecutor's request that Dahl be placed under house arrest and required to wear a GPS bracelet. An arrest warrant has been issued for Dahl. Anyone with information on his whereabouts is asked to contact the Freeborn County Sheriff's Office at 507-277-5200 extension 5.

Slate Sign In Sign Up The Insane Mystery Hanging Over Donald Trump’s Tax Plan The Insane Mystery Hanging Over Donald Trump’s Tax Plan Slate Sign In Sign Up Slate Moneybox A blog about business and economics. Sept. 16 2016 6:07 PM The Insane Mystery Hanging Over Donald Trump’s Tax Plan By Jordan Weissmann   What lurks in this man's mind? Alex Wong/Getty Images When presidential candidates unveil major public policy proposals, they typical have a pretty firm idea of what's going to be included in them. But Donald J. Trump is no ordinary presidential candidate. And more then 24 hours after announcing the latest iteration of his tax plan at a snazzy event in New York, it is unclear whether it will contain a trillion-dollar giveaway to wealthy businessmen and financiers—like him. Jordan Weissmann Jordan Weissmann is Slate’s senior business and economics correspondent. Isn't this election fun? Advertisement As recently as last month, the Republican nominee was touting a plan that would have allowed all businesses to pay a single max tax rate of 15 percent. What made this proposal especially startling, not to mention wildly expensive, was that it wouldn't have just applied to companies organized as C corporations—think Exxon, Apple, or Walmart—but also so-called pass-through entities, which include a whole alphabet soup of business types you might be familiar with, like LLCs, LLPs, and S-Corps. Pass-through entities don't pay the corporate rate, which currently tops out at 35 percent. Instead, their profits are distributed directly to their owners, who then pay taxes on them as normal income. A lot of truly small businesses are set up this way. But so are hedge funds, private equity firms, real estate developers, and major law firms, whose partners would often pay a top rate of 39.6 percent on their earnings. Trump was essentially offering to cut their top tax rate by more than half. Perhaps not coincidentally, the Trump Organization LLC is a pass-through entity. Get Slate in your inbox. It is hard to overstate what a truly terrible policy idea this is. You know how people complain about the carried interest rule that gives hedge fund and private equity guys a tax break? This is that on performance-enhancing drugs, a version that wouldn't just help Wall Streeters, but businessmen like Trump himself and the well-paid lawyers who help him minimize his tax bill. It's essentially a lite version of the disastrous tax cuts that have gutted the Kansas state budget. (There, the government completely eliminated taxes on pass-through income.) You will sometimes see “small business” lobbyists argue that giving corporations and pass-through entities the same tax rate will somehow “even the playing field” between them, but even that's complete bunk. The money corporations earn gets taxed twice—once, on the corporate level, and second, when it's distributed to shareholders as a dividend. With law firms and hedge funds or your local boutique, it's only getting taxed once. Anyway, when Trump announced his tax plan Thursday, it appeared he had experienced a momentary bout of sense and had nixed the 15 percent rate for pass-through businesses. Or so he told the conservative Tax Foundation, which he asked to estimate the cost of his plan. But then, as the New York Times' Binya Appelbaum reported Friday, his campaign “privately reassured” the National Federation of Independent Business that it was still on board with the cut. “We have it directly from his campaign,” a spokesman told the paper.

DAVID HALPERIN Why For-Profit Colleges Are the Bottom Feeders of the College World View More Advertisement Since then, the Tax Foundation's analysts has been trying to pin the Trump campaign down on whether or not it supports the break. Last I talked to them, they still hadn't had any success. This is not a small amount of money we are talking about. Kyle Pomerleau, the Tax Foundation's director of federal projects, told me that the pass-through giveaway would be worth about $1.5 trillion over a decade. (Previous reports suggested it was worth about $1 trillion.) However, that's based on the tenuous assumption businesses won't reincorporate as pass-throughs to take advantage of the incredibly low rates, which is exactly what happened in Kansas. (A lot of high-earners might also just incorporate themselves to get the break.) "In a way the $1.5 trillion is the optimistic score,” Pomerleau said. Keep in mind, without the pass-through break, Trump's plan would supposedly cost $4.4 trillion—we're talking about a 35 percent difference. Top Comment All my life I have hear objections to taxes.  The first year I filed I paid no taxes.  Last year I paid $20K in taxes.  I was happier last year.  More... Join In That all said, it's almost not worth agonizing over the specifics of Trump's tax vision. In the end, Trump would likely sign whatever tax cut House Speaker Paul Ryan hands him. And currently, the GOP's ideologue-in-chief wants to cut the rate on pass-through entities to 25 percent. So a President Trump might have to settle on a slightly more modest version of his absolutely god-awful idea.

Adam Smith Tampa Bay Times i By ADAM C. SMITH Tampa Bay Times LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story HOLIDAY, Fla. Donald Trump’s prospects for winning the White House will probably rise or fall among the strip malls and 1,000-square-foot ranch homes of southwest Pasco County. In this working-class suburb of Tampa Bay, finding people enthusiastically supporting Hillary Clinton is tough. Finding people enthusiastically supporting Trump is less difficult. Finding people fed up with the status quo is a piece of cake. “It’s not that I like Trump that much, it’s that I dislike Hillary so much. I don’t think [Barack] Obama did anything for us, and I see it continuing with Hillary. At least with Trump, there’s a chance for some change, and I’m all for change,” said 66-year-old retiree Ken Seekford, plunging into a bowl of soup at Jimmy’s Restaurant in downtown New Port Richey. A lifelong Democrat who moved to Pasco from Maryland two years ago, Seekford is so turned off by Clinton that he switched his registration to Republican after watching the Democratic National Convention. “Look at everything she was caught in,” he said. “With those emails, somebody asks her, ‘Did you wipe your hard drive?’ And she says, ‘What do you mean, with a rag?’ Come on, she’s smarter than that.” Trump can’t win the presidency without winning Florida, and many observers question how he can win Florida if he fails to do better among Florida’s one in three minority voters. That’s not expected to happen. So how is it that poll after poll shows Trump running neck-and-neck with Clinton, with a real shot at winning Florida’s 29 electoral votes? The answer lies behind the Advanced Auto Parts and Big Lots stores along U.S. 19, in 40-year-old subdivisions with names like Holiday Lakes Estates, Beacon Square and Regency Park. Those who divide Florida into political territories call this corner of Pasco County Florida House District 36. And unlike the vast majority of legislative districts across America, the roughly 100,000 voters here tend to be independent-minded and unpredictable. Thirty-five percent are registered Republicans, 34 percent Democrats and 31 percent belong to neither party. In 2008 and in 2012, Obama narrowly carried Florida House District 36, and narrowly won Florida. But a poll of likely voters taken in July by a Democratic polling firm found Trump with a double-digit lead over Clinton — 51 percent to 39 percent — in this district. Tailor-made for Trump Southwest Pasco County looks tailor-made for Trump: 90 percent white, nearly 90 percent without college degrees, median household income of about $34,000. Also, widespread anxiety over crime and a deteriorating quality of life. In the 1970s, this was a blue-collar retirement mecca that attracted Northeasterners who could buy a comfortable two-bedroom ranch with attached garage for $10,000. Many of these same homes sold for more than $140,000 during the peak of the housing bubble in 2006, only to see their values plummet to less than $50,000 today. The numbers help explain how Trump is defying the conventional political wisdom that Florida’s fast-changing demographics will make the state a steep climb for a Republican nominee so weak among minority voters. That conventional wisdom also may underestimate Clinton’s unpopularity based on conversations inside the VFW post, outside the Walmart and inside Jimmy’s Restaurant. “She should be in jail, and you or me would be if we did what she did with those emails,” said Dorothy Jay of Holiday over lunch at Jimmy’s with her husband. “At least Trump is not going to be taking payoffs from people wanting something.” “I don’t trust her, and we don’t need another four years of Obama,” said Alan Jay, who moved with his wife to the area from Long Island in 1994. “Trump’s problem is that he has diarrhea of the mouth. He speaks before he thinks, but what comes out of his mouth is honest.” Republican pollster Wes Anderson, who works for the Rebuilding America Now super PAC helping Trump, said Clinton has at least as much to do with Trump’s strength in Florida as Trump. “Everyone talks about Trump’s negatives, and we kind of miss the point that Hillary Clinton has just as strong negatives as he does — and in some ways hers are more telling,” Anderson said. “This is a change election, and she is anything but that. Whether she likes it or not, she wears the mantle of the political establishment. … That is actually what’s happening in Florida.” Even as Clinton dramatically outspends Trump on TV ads in Florida and builds a more robust voter-turnout operation, the candidates are virtually tied. The average of recent Florida polls compiled by RealClearPolitics.com on Friday had Trump with 45.1 percent support and Clinton with 44.4 percent. “The assumption is it’s because Trump is running up the score in the markets where Republicans have to run up the score when they win Florida,” Anderson said. “I think that’s only half of the story. There are lots of places where she is under-performing, and I do think it’s going to come down to Tampa and Orlando.” Candidates and political operatives in competitive legislative races in Hillsborough and Pinellas counties say they see Trump running much stronger than expected. Democratic state Rep. Amanda Murphy represents District 36 and keeps her distance from Clinton while knocking on doors or talking with residents, many of whom recently experienced severe flooding from Hurricane Hermine. She said she understands the sentiments of Trump backers she encounters. “People do want change, and I understand that,” said Murphy, who stresses to people that she is not a lifelong politician and is focused on Tallahassee, not Washington. The district used to be represented by Republican Mike Fasano, now Pasco’s tax collector, who said he hears plenty of anecdotal evidence about Trump’s strength. “I don’t know that they are as much in love with Donald Trump as they are disgusted with the whole process, and they have been disgusted by it for years,” Fasano said. “People are just tired of the old regimes in Washington, whether it be Republicans or Democrats, and whether it’s Mitch McConnell or John Boehner or Hillary Clinton. They’re just tired of it. They feel understandably like they’re not being told the truth, and they’re tired of being pushed aside.” Even if Trump wins this district comfortably, he could lose Florida. Charlie Crist, the populist Republican-turned Democratic candidate for governor, beat Rick Scott by 10 percentage points here in 2014 but still lost narrowly statewide. Four years ago, Mitt Romney lost this district to Obama by 2,404 votes, or nearly 4 percentage points. But this year’s super wealthy Republican nominee is connecting far better with the blue-collar voters of Pasco than 2012’s super wealthy nominee. Among the transplanted Northeasterners, Trump is more Queens than Wall Street. “Trump works with laborers and goes up and pats them on the back. Hillary doesn’t do that,” said Seekford. “Hillary doesn’t even want to touch a commoner. It might rub off on her.” At Jimmy’s with his wife, 84-year-old Democrat Joe Trumbauer talked about how tough it is caring for his wife with Alzheimer’s because he can’t afford help. He’s a loyal Democrat, a former Mack Truck auto worker from Allentown, Pennsylvania, but is intrigued by Trump. “We didn’t get a Social Security raise in the last two or three years — and that’s Democrats in the White House,” Trumbauer said. “I do in a way want to vote for Trump, but I’m afraid to because I don’t know what he’s going to do.” Even Clinton supporters in the area sounded sheepish about supporting her. Inside Randolph Ford VFW Post 7845 in Port Richey, where most of the boisterous men and women at the bar said they liked Trump, retired Air Force veteran John Rodgers, 80, said Clinton supporters like himself tend to be more low-key. “It’s because she’s been in politics for so long,’’ Rodgers said. “It’s hard to get excited about and trust someone who’s been in politics so long.” Contact Adam Smith at asmith@tampabay.com.

Why? Mainly because digital shopping continues to siphon shoppers away from physical stores. As mall traffic continues to slow, there isn’t enough foot traffic for many retailers to justify a large physical footprint. While the vast majority of commerce still occurs at the store level retailers are quickly realizing that they no longer need to have a store in every community to be successful. Store closings continue to be a daily occurance accros the industry regardless of segment. Below are 10 retailers that have undergone or plan to implement significant store closings.      1.Sports Authority. Sports Authority will close around 460 stores 2.Macy’s. Macy’s will close down around 100 stores nationwide. 3.Aeropostale. Aeropostale will close around 154 stores. 4.Walmart. Walmart will close around 269 stores, including 154 U.S. store locations. 5.Walgreens. Walgreens will close around 200 stores. 6.FinishLine. FinishLine will close 150 of their 167 stores. 7.Ralph Lauren. Ralph Lauren will close at least 50 of their stores. 8.American Eagle. American Eagle will close 150 of 1000 of their stores. 9.JC Penney. JC Penney has closed 73 stores already, and will close 7 more stores in 2016. 10.Office Depot.

Food prices have fallen sharply in recent weeks, leaving consumers with lower food bills. (Photo: Michael McLoone / for the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel) 60 CONNECTTWEET 7 LINKEDIN 7 COMMENTEMAILMORE The fancy term is “food price deflation,” and it means your grocery bill has suddenly become smaller. That’s good for consumers, while it can create challenges for businesses, especially grocery stores. The price of food bought from grocery stores in July plunged 1.6% from the same month in 2015, the sharpest decline since January 2010, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's latest food price outlook. The price declines are being led by drops in the costs of beef, poultry, eggs and dairy products. A strong U.S. dollar, which lowers the cost of imported food items, and lower crude oil prices also are contributing to the overall decline. Grocery prices in the United States have now fallen for eight consecutive months, underscoring an ongoing food deflation that has supermarkets in a competitive war while shoppers reap the benefits. Pat Fox, president of the Fox Bros. Piggly Wiggly chain of stores that operates in Milwaukee's northern and western suburbs, said the situation is both good and bad.                   Graphic: Trends in food price deflation "We’re thankful that we can provide our guests with some great prices that they haven’t seen in years," Fox said. He said his stores will be running a beef special in coming weeks and, "We haven't run that price in 15 years." However, the situation also can be a challenge because it reduces the number of dollars that are coming in to cash registers, even as the amount of food being purchased remains the same or even increases. "It’s definitely a challenging environment," Fox said. "All of us in the industry are affected by this decline in the retail dollars we ring through." Kroger Co., the world's third-largest retailer behind Walmart and Costco and the grocery market share leader in Wisconsin by virtue of its 2015 purchase of Roundy's Inc., said as much in its earnings report that was issued last week. Kroger blamed lower prices for denting its second quarter profits, as well as forcing it to lower financial projections for the rest of the year. "The transition from inflation to deflation creates a difficult operating environment," Kroger CEO Rodney McMullen told analysts on a conference call. The fiercely contested grocery market in nearly all of Wisconsin's largest cities only adds to the downward price pressure. "I think Wisconsin right now might be — if not the most competitive — one of the most competitive marketplaces in the United States for grocery," Fox said. "We have a hypercompetitive marketplace that’s over-stored." That forces grocers to match or beat each other's prices, further shrinking margins, the business term for how much money is left from sales after all expenses are deducted. Margins in the grocery business are typically about 1.5%, according to research from the Food Marketing Institute, a retail food industry trade association based in Arlington, Va. For grocers, the situation is even more complex than it seems at first blush. Consider milk and meat. "Ninety-five percent of shoppers buy milk at least once in a year, and on average they buy it 24 times a year," said Jim Hertel, senior vice president of Willard Bishop, a suburban Chicago food retail and production consultancy that is part of Inmar Analytics. And "meat has been a destination category or a destination department, especially for retailers who are trying to differentiate themselves," Hertel said. In a falling price environment, that differentiation can be lost. "(Stores) have depended on these categories in order to be able to drive trips and loyalty," Hertel said. "When that gets threatened, it’s not just the dairy category that’s at risk or a meat category that’s at risk. It’s the trip (that’s at risk.)" If someone chooses to go elsewhere because of a cheaper price, “then you’ve not only lost the $2.79 on a gallon of milk, but you’ve lost $22.79 or $42.79 in terms of what was the value of that trip. "That’s why everybody is so skittish about it," Hertel said. "That’s why they are so quick to protect market share...It’s high-stakes poker." The lower prices also are being driven by what is expected to be an abundant crop harvest this fall and the rebalancing of poultry and beef cattle herds that had been thinned by avian flu in birds and drought across cattle-producing regions of the United States. A drop in worldwide demand is also adding downside pressure to prices. "There is slackening demand for a lot of these commodities internationally, especially in China," Hertel said. "Their economy is probably more challenged than it has been in a long, long time." Experts say the food price deflation is part of a supply and demand cycle seen in the food business every few years or so. It is not likely to lead to broader deflation in the U.S. economy, said Abdur Chowdhury an economics professor at Marquette University who is the former chief economist for the United Nations Economic Commission in Europe. Any deflationary trend “is obviously something we need to keep a close eye on," Chowdhury said. "An example is what’s happening in the Eurozone countries. In the United States, we are not in that situation. I’m still not very concerned about (deflation.)" Whether the lower food prices prompt American consumers to take the savings and spend it on other things remains to be seen, Chowdhury said. "We saw that happen with gasoline prices," he said. But when fuel prices fell initially, consumers held onto the savings. It was months later that the extra cash from cheaper fuel began to manifest itself in higher consumer spending. "Maybe with food that will happen," Chowdhury said, "but there may be a lag. Low prices are obviously very good news for consumers." Food prices at the wholesale level dropped 1.6% in August, according to data released Friday. In a separate report on consumer prices, also released Friday, the Labor Department's statistical category that covers meat, poultry, fish and eggs fell for the 12th month in a row.

Mike McKeon, 73, died last night after a long illness during which he typically worked almost to the end. The last three or four times I spoke with him over the past year, he was in the hospital, but he still wanted to pitch a story or an issue in which he was involved. "He was a visionary for me," says political consultant Thom Serafin, who worked with and on the opposite side of McKeon in a variety of political races and for corporate clients such as Wal-Mart. "Everybody does the numbers," Serafin adds. "But he could see things through a different prism," correctly predicting the nomination of devotees of political extremist Lyndon LaRouche that scuttled Adlai Stevenson III's bid for governor three decades ago and, more recently, the nomination of Donald Trump for president. "He was the toughest guy in the room, and loyal to a fault. He's the kind of guy you'd want in the foxhole with you." McKeon's clients were numerous and bipartisan, and on both sides of the aisle. Included were Democratic gubernatorial candidate Paul Vallas and GOP gubernatorial nominee Bill Brady. He also, on occasion, did some work for Crain's and other publications. Survivors include two daughters, Meghan Marino and Zora Baron; two brothers, two sisters and four grandchildren. A memorial gathering and service has been scheduled for Sep. 23 at the Fred C.

Two months after acquiring Dollar Shave Club for about $1 billion, Unilever is reportedly in talks to buy Jessica Alba's Honest Co. for a similar amount. Like Dollar Shave, Honest is a popular consumer brand that's taken advantage of modern internet marketing and distribution tools to compete with industry giants. The Wall Street Journal, citing a person familiar with the matter, reported Thursday night that talks between Unilever and Honest are at an early stage and that Honest "hasn't ruled out going for an initial public offering instead." A Unilever spokesperson declined to comment, and a representative from Honest didn't respond to a request for comment. While not providing the level of gains that VCs generate from massive Facebook and Google acquisitions or from blockbuster IPOs, Unilever is at least offering some healthy liquidity to investors and proving venture-backed start-ups can succeed in penetrating markets outside of technology. The dealmaking is particularly good news for investors in consumer packaged goods, where big acquirers have yet to materialize. In retail, Wal-Mart recently shelled out $3.3 billion for Jet.com and Nordstrom previously purchased HauteLook and Trunk Club, but there's been virtually no activity in the market for packaged foods, beverages and household goods. show chapters <p>Dollar Shave Club&#039;s top investor on $1B deal</p> <p>Unilever bought the Dollar Shave Club for $1 billion. One of the shave club&#039;s largest investors David Pakman, Venrock venture capitalist, discusses the deal. </p> Dollar Shave Club's top investor on $1B deal    Wednesday, 20 Jul 2016 | 1:46 PM ET | 03:28 "Unilever is stepping up now and becoming potentially that innovative leader that looks at acquisitions of these new companies as a strategy for growing, modernizing the brand and taking products to new demographics," said Josh Goldman, a partner at Norwest Venture Partners and an investor in e-commerce companies including Casper, ModCloth and Gilt Groupe. "They've got a line of VCs lining up to talk to them now." Honest is based in Santa Monica, California, just a few miles from Dollar Shave. Alba, who starred in films including "Little Fockers" and "Fantastic Four," started the company in 2011, and has gained traction through online sales of diapers, organic baby formula, laundry detergent and dish soap. Headquartered more than 5,000 miles away in London, Unilever is the world's fourth-largest fast-moving consumer goods company, according to OC&C Strategy Consultants. The top three are Nestle, Procter & Gamble and PepsiCo. As Unilever expands its brand, don't expect it to be entirely friendly to start-ups and Silicon Valley. In 2014, the maker of Hellmann's mayonnaise sued start-up food company Hampton Creek, claiming that its Just Mayo product was engaging in false advertising because it wasn't real mayonnaise. Hellmann's later dropped the suit, but turned around earlier this year and introduced competitive eggless products. Of course, San Francisco-based Hampton Creek now has bigger problems, after Bloomberg reported last month that the company bought its own products from stores across the country. The U.S. Justice Department subsequently opened a criminal probe into whether the company committed fraud. Unilever shares Even if Unilever ends up buying Honest for $1 billion or something close to it, some investors will be disappointed. In August 2015, the company was valued at $1.7 billion in a funding round led by Glade Brook Capital Partners. In total, the company has raised more than $220 million. Still, any billion-dollar acquisition lifts optimism among venture capitalists. After all, Twilio is the only venture-backed U.S. tech company to go public in 2016, and the IPO market is headed for its worst year since the depths of the financial crisis. And for investors concerned that Amazon.com is becoming the one-stop shop for all retail and consumer goods, an aggressive Unilever represents some hope. "Many investors shy away from commerce companies," wrote David Pakman, a partner at venture firm Venrock, in a blog post after Dollar Shave — one of his investments — was acquired. "The multiples tend to be low, Amazon is ever-present, and lots of capital can be required to scale. To us, we didn't see DSC as an e-commerce company, but instead as a model for new full-stack consumer products companies."

(David Gottschalk/The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette via AP) On the heels of this week’s much heralded debut of Uber’s self-driving cars, we bring you this bit of intelligence: Walmart has filed a patent to develop a self-driving shopping cart. The report, via Quartz, is quick to point out that a patent doesn’t necessarily mean a company is working on a specific product, but the concept is intriguing. [Uber’s self-driving cars — be prepared to be thrilled and bored at the same time] The idea would to be to get shoppers more quickly to the products they want. Anyone who has ever walked into a Walmart — or any large store — for the first time, can attest to how daunting it can be to find exactly what you’re looking for. As Quartz reports: The application depicts a Roomba-esque motorized device attached to the underside of a shopping cart. Customers use their smartphone or other mobile device to summon the internet-connected device. From there, the cart is controlled by a centralized computer, and navigates the store using its sensors. The shopping cart will serve as a guide to different items the shopper is looking for throughout the store. [Here’s the patent for Walmart’s self-driving shopping cart] There’s even an illustration of what the device would look like. All this talk of automating carts raises another question in our mind: Given the problem of shopping cart theft, could a self-driving cart also be equipped with a self-parking mechanism? local dr-gridlock Orlando Shooting Updates News and analysis on the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. post_newsletter348 follow-orlando false after3th false Please provide a valid email address.

According to police, they arrested 41-year-old Joshua Farris in connection to the death of 38-year-old Jeannie Howard, found dead on theTroy Avenue bridge near Senour Road and Kitley Road around 12:45 a.m. on June 24. Investigators ruled her death a homicide on Sept. 2. An arrest warrant for Farris was issued six days later. Farris was found in a homeless camp behind a Walmart in Ocala, Florida by US Marshals and local law enforcement on Thursday. He is being held in Florida and is awaiting extradition back to Indiana. Court documents show that Farris had previously been accused of beating Howard. Court documents filed in April show Farris was charged with battery and intimidation after punching Howard and threatening his neighbor. Howard had a bump on her head, a swollen left eye, a large cut on her cheek and a swollen and cut lip when investigators spoke with her on April 25. She said Farris punched her in the face several times before she passed out. A neighbor looked out of his window and saw Farris and Howard outside in April. The neighbor said Farris threw Howard against the side of a trailer, said “If you ever come back, I’ll kill you,” then mentioned that he had a gun that he was not afraid to use on her or the neighbors. Investigators said Farris was belligerent when they went to interview him. When asked if he wanted to make a statement, Farris told investigators they “don’t have [expletive].” Police said Farris had Howard’s phone on him at the time of the arrest. Just two months later, Howard was found dead, partially naked on the side of the road. An autopsy revealed she died from multiple head injuries/blunt force trauma. Howard’s roommate said Farris and Howard were together at a barbeque on June 22. Detectives received a search warrant for a vehicle belonging to the mother of Farris. A bloody hand print was visible on the trunk lid. Blood was on the rear bumper and in the trunk. Farris’ neighbor said she saw Farris driving his mother’s car on June 23. A search warrant for a trailer belonging to Farris revealed blood on the ceiling, pillow cover and wall in the bedroom. Detectives flipped over a mattress and found a large blood stain. Some of the blood on the mattress was still wet. Another large blood stain was found inside of a trash can on the front porch.

Advertisement A revolution of sorts is happening in the produce industry. The fruits and vegetables that just a few years ago were deemed “weird” or “no good” are sneaking past the compost bin and making it into supermarkets. Mega stores such as Whole Foods and Walmart recently joined the party, adding so-called “ugly” fruits and vegetables to their shelves after being presented with a Change.org petition signed by thousands of “ugly produce” supporters. Consumers have been warming up to the idea of purchasing imperfect produce with the help of humorous campaigns showing wonky looking carrots and scary statistics that illustrate how much food is wasted each year.  But chefs have always been fans of “No. 2,” “ugly” and “imperfect” produce. Awareness of ugly produce is growing, according to Jordan Figueiredo, anti-food-waste activist and founder of @UglyFruitandVeg. But he said the U.S. still has a ways to go to make an impact on food waste. “Just a few years ago, there weren’t any large supermarkets selling ugly produce, and now there are four; there was hardly anything in the news about ugly, and now there’s a story almost every week over the last year and a half,” said Figueiredo. “In the category of really taking a big bite out of the 20 billion pounds of produce, mostly ugly, that’s wasted in the U.S., however, we’re still in the very early stages.” Marra St. Clair, co-founder and operator of Project Juice, based in San Francisco, said, “I’m thrilled that natural food leaders like Whole Foods are beginning to experiment with customer acceptance of ugly fruit. I think it’s indicative of a huge step in the right direction. While the produce may not look as perfect as we’ve been conditioned to expect, it’s nutritionally perfect and delivers awesome farm-fresh flavor.” Chef Maneet Chauhan, owner of Chauhan Ale & Masala House in Nashville, Tenn., said one of the biggest problems is awareness. “People have this perception that if it doesn’t look good it’s not good enough to eat,” Chauhan said. “In this day and age, chefs are being conscious about waste and how to manage it, and I think taking steps to utilize ugly fruit makes you a better operator.” It’s also a way to support local farmers, added Greg Gettles, chef de cuisine of Mercantile and Mash in Charleston, S.C. “Our flawed sense of what’s good or tasty just based on appearance is one of the reasons why our communities are suffering,” said Gettles. “The only real way to fill that disconnect is to get out and meet your farmers, express interest in those cast-offs, and get creative with ways to prep or process them.” Using ugly produce in menus » 1 2 Next Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Please Log In or Register to post comments.

(Sara Dorn, cleveland.com) Print Email Sara Dorn, cleveland.com By Sara Dorn, cleveland.com The Plain Dealer Follow on Twitter on September 16, 2016 at 3:18 PM comments As courts in Cuyahoga County take steps to build a fairer bail system, dozens of courts across the country are making changes to prevent bail from discriminating against people who can't afford it. Read about recent bail-reform news below as part of Impact 2016: Justice For All, a cleveland.com series that examines Cuyahoga County's bail system and how it could be made more equitable and cost-effective. New Jersey to make fair bail law Jan. 1: An amendment to the New Jersey Constitution aimed at preventing defendants from having to stay in jail because they can't afford bail will go into effect next year, according to multiple reports. Before setting bail, judges will be required to more thoroughly assess a defendant's risk of skipping court or committing crimes. The new law also encourages judges to limit the use of bail for low-risk defendants. The amendment requires the use of a six-point assessment to determine defendants' risk before their first bail hearing, all within 48 hours of their arrest. It also gives judges the power to jail people before their trial if they are deemed a danger to the community or risk of committing a crime while out. Current law requires judges to set bail for everyone except those accused of capital offenses. Man sues over $20,000 bail for crime he says he didn't commit: A Pennsylvania man claims he was forced to plead no-contest to theft charges because he could not afford the $20,000 bail a judge set. Joseph Curry turned himself in after he read in the paper that a warrant was out for his arrest for stealing from a Wal-Mart store he said he has never been to, according to courthousenews.com. Because he couldn't afford to pay his bail, he spent three months in jail, missed the birth of his child and lost his job. Curry sued the police officers who arrested him and Wal-Mart. U.S. Third Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Michael Chagares dismissed the case, but blasted the flawed bail system that forced Curry to stay behind bars. "Curry's inability to post bail deprived him not only of his freedom, but also of his ability to seek redress for the potentially unconstitutional prosecution that landed him in jail in the first place," Chagares said, according to the Courthouse News Service. Freeing defendants in Chicago: Former Chicago mayoral candidate Willie Wilson has promised to put $50,000 toward bailing out Cook County defendants who are accused of minor crimes and can't afford to make bail, according to the Chicago Tribune. As of Sept. 15, there were 344 suspects in the Cook County jail who needed $1,000 or less to get out, according to the Tribune. Wilson said he hopes to bail out 5,000 people by 2017. So far, he has helped six people. New Mexico could make unaffordable bail unconstitutional: Voters will decide in November on a constitutional amendment that would all but eliminate bail. Judges could jail people deemed dangerous or a flight risk without the opportunity to post bond, and release others without making them pay. "The goal is to kind of move away from paying altogether and detain people pretrial based on their risk only," said Julia Downs, a fiscal analyst for New Mexico's legislative finance committee. The amendment aims to make New Mexico's bail practices fairer, and save the state millions of dollars in jail expenses. Downs estimates the state could recoup $17.9 million in 2017 if the measure passes.

Posted: Friday, September 16, 2016 Tweet Conversation on Stanton tree removal remains controversial Posted by Meghan Nelson • Last Updated 12:05 pm on Friday, September 16 2016 Tweet The pomes on the Bradford pear trees along Camburn Street in Stanton are starting to mature. The trees have been discussed at the last three Stanton City Commission meetings, including the meeting Tuesday night. — Daily News/Meghan Koglin   STANTON — Trees across Montcalm County are beginning to change, with apples maturing and leaves on the tips of trees starting to transform to their fall colors. However, the controversy about whether the Bradford pear trees along Camburn Street in downtown Stanton will come come down has not changed. Stanton residents Don Smucker, Michael Van Kleeck and former Judge Charles Miel all defended the trees at Stanton’s City Commission meeting Tuesday night. Miel brought pictures of the Bradford pear trees in bloom in spring and talked about how they add to the downtown district. He also disputed an idea brought up at a previous City Commission meeting that downtown Stanton shouldn’t have trees because businesses like Meijer and Walmart don’t have trees. “They do have some trees,” Miel said. “But they have a different strategy than downtown Stanton.” Smucker, once the director of the MSU Montcalm Extension, said he has experience with trees and thinks the trees are in good health. One of the concerns about the trees is the mess the dropped pomes leave on the ground in front of businesses. “Several years ago, the council tried to apply a spray to prevent the fruit,” Smucker said. “It didn’t work, but maybe there are other ways to knock the buds down. I like those trees.” The sidewalk on the southeast side of Camburn Street has several dropped pomes and leaves from the Bradford pear trees. The trees have been discussed at the last three Stanton City Commission meetings, including the meeting Tuesday night. — Daily News/Megan Koglin Van Kleeck lives on Camburn Street and said he hasn’t noticed a problem with the pomes. “Anything that can be picked up and tracked in, you’d think it would happen to me,” he said. “My wife is in a wheelchair. Not being able to take wheels off, if there was nothing to be tracked, it would get tracked into my house.” Van Kleeck likes the appearance of the trees and what they do to downtown Stanton. Commissioner Ken Burris and Stanton resident Ray Holloway are still in favor of removing the trees. “I still think it would be best for the trees to go,” Holloway said. “If I get a new pair of shoes, I’m not going to walk on the sidewalk with the mess.” Holloway also mentioned thinking of hiring an arborist or professional to trim the trees. “The trees should have never been planted,” Burris said. “They weren’t supposed to bear fruit in the original plan. No matter how much you prune and trim, you’re never going to be able to make some of these trees look pretty.” Stanton sought three bids to remove the trees, but according to City Manager Jake Eckholm, the bids were too expensive and didn’t include a replacement plan. Eckholm recommended tabling the issue and reaching out to specific business owners who had issues with the trees to find a solution. “I don’t see why healthy trees should be removed on tax-payer dollars,” Eckholm said.   About the Author Meghan Nelson Meghan is the Stanton and Lakeview area reporter for The Daily News.

GrubSouth, founded by Katie Herron and Marge Loveday, is now offering online ordering and delivery at Star Market in Huntsville. It's a natural transition for GrubSouth, which has been serving restaurants since its launch four years ago. Big-box retailers Walmart and Kroger already offer online grocery ordering and pickup, while Shipt provides same-day delivery from Publix stores in Huntsville and Madison. Mark Tow, director of pharmacy operations for Star Market, believes every grocer will have to address the need in some way. "We do deliver to our local customers, but this is the first attempt to use a company like GrubSouth," he told AL.com. "We believe it will be a large part of the growth in the near future." How does the service work? Loveday said customers can visit GrubSouth.com on their phone, tablet or computer, select "Grocery," and pick the products they want to buy. GrubSouth then sends a shopper to the Five Points store and delivers the order within the hour. Delivery is currently available to zip codes 35801, 35811, 35802, 35805 and 35806, but Loveday said they will expand the service in the future. "We do plan on adding more grocery locations and at that point we hope to have grocery available to more areas," she said. "Right now, we are offering free delivery for first-time customers." The delivery fee, which is based on the distance and driving time from the store to a customer's home or business, normally ranges from $4 to $12. Product markup will not exceed 25 percent and pickup is also available. Since GrubSouth began taking pre-orders on Sunday, Herron said customers have provided positive feedback on the service, which includes Italian food from the on-site Terry's Pizza. "People love the easy-to-use site and being able to have us shop for them," she said. "Some customers have chosen the pickup option." A turning point in retail Research firm IBISWorld said virtual grocery sales should increase 9.5 percent each year to become a $9.4 billion industry by 2017. Other sources estimate shoppers spent $18 to $24 billion last year on online groceries alone. As mom-and-pop stores compete with larger businesses, Tow said it's important Star Market remains innovative in order to meet shopper needs. "Our customer base will be expanded and we are all about adding convenience for Star customers," he said. "We do not currently have an online ordering system so this gets us in the game with all our large competitors." Herron, a touring musician looking to supplement her income, developed the GrubSouth concept in 2012 after realizing there was a need for restaurant delivery in Huntsville. Loveday, who also plays music for a living, helped Herron build the brand as a revenue stream to co-exist with their music careers. GrubSouth started with only nine eateries and three drivers, but now has more than 100 restaurant partners, 40 drivers and four dispatchers. Herron said Nick Tucker has been instrumental in getting the online grocery service off the ground. "We have had an increasing number of people express their need for a service like this and for some, it will greatly increase their quality of life," she said.

According to IMPD, officers in Ocala, Fla., took Joshua Farris, 41, into custody on Thursday. U.S. Marshals and local law enforcement officers found him in a homeless camp behind a Walmart. On June 24, Indianapolis Metropolitan police were called to the 10900 block of East Troy Avenue after a body was found along the side of the road. Police identified the woman as 38-year-old Jeannie Howard. Detectives saw signs of trauma but couldn’t immediately determine if the injuries led to Howard’s death. The Marion County Coroner’s Office later said that Howard died from chop wounds to the head—combined sharp and blunt force trauma. The coroner’s office ruled her death a homicide on Sept. 2 and an arrest warrant was issued for Farris on Sept. 8. Farris remained on the run until being arrested in Florida on a warrant for murder. He’s being held in Florida’s Marion County as he awaits extradition back to Indianapolis. 29.187199 -82.140092 Filed in: Crime, News Suggest a correction × Suggest A Correction Your name Your email Report a typo or grammatical error Cancel Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Email Google Pinterest Leave a Reply Cancel reply Enter your comment here...

Read today's eNewspaper Entertainment TV & Media If everything about watching TV has changed, then how is 'fall TV' still a thing? 'Insecure' Anne Marie Fox / HBO Issa Rae as Issa and Yvonne Orji as Molly in HBO's "Insecure." Issa Rae as Issa and Yvonne Orji as Molly in HBO's "Insecure." (Anne Marie Fox / HBO) Hank StueverThe Washington Post It's odd how we cling to certain TV rituals. The whole idea of "Fall TV," for example. There's an ongoing, revolutionary upgrade in the many ways we watch television, so how is it that consumers are still expected to gorge on two to three dozen premieres at once (from broadcast, cable and streaming) every September and October, the way we've always done it? Or, with a nod to HBO satirist John Oliver's exasperated segments on outdated social conventions: How is fall TV still a thing? MOST READ ENTERTAINMENT NEWS THIS HOUR Consider the 18 days in late July and early August that the networks (broadcast, cable and now streaming) spend promoting their new fall shows to the Television Critics Association press tour at the Beverly Hilton Hotel, in much they same way did in the 1970s. Some 200 reporters and critics (including this one) get a good, long, hyped-up look at all the offerings that the new season will bring. They go to cocktail parties and interview the stars of the new shows. The hotel itself, a midcentury beauty of the "Mad Men" era where the Golden Globes are held each year and ancient celebrity photos adorn the walls, has a way of making critics feel like we've stepped back several decades. There can sometimes be a sense of shared delusion and optimism. I always come back from a press tour with a renewed crush on TV, in love all over again. Then I come to my senses - usually when I re-watch the final versions of pilot episodes and have to write reviews of them. The mutual (possibly insane) understanding, from network to critic to viewer, is that half of these shows won't survive. That's usually because they aren't very good, but also, increasingly, because of inundation. In this "peak TV" era (the hazardous-waste stage of television's latest "golden age") a viewer has about 450 current dramas and comedies to choose from across multiple platforms, over a single year. More if you count foreign-made series, plus 700 or so others if you add non-scripted, "reality" programming. Isn't it ludicrous to still believe that a deluge of new shows would manage to find just the right audience in an eight-week period tied to the changing color of leaves? Especially in an industry that increasingly disregards its old measures of success, each choosing its own special cocktail of Nielsen ratings, in-house data, "buzz" (social network traffic), critics' reviews and acute measures of time-shifted viewing to determine a hit? Behind the happy hype, it's madness. Alan Wurtzel, NBC's longtime president of research and media development, is becoming a press-tour fixture; give him 20 minutes and he will overwhelm a roomful of math-challenged journalists with data about how and when different demographics ingest their TV. In addition to the extraordinary amounts of content people are watching on video screens (from the TV on the wall to the phone in their hands it's now close to six hours a day on average, NBC found), Wurtzel recently looked at factors that get viewers to start watching a new show at all. He said that 54 percent of viewers of all ages agreed that they probably would not start watching a show unless multiple episodes are available to them on demand. To them, a "new" show is likely to be one they simply haven't had time to watch yet but has been out long enough to earn a reputation or personal recommendation. Once they've decided to try it out, they want as much of it as possible, or else it's not worth committing to. One ballyhooed premiere episode is not enough. "The idea that you can just open up a show is not enough anymore," Wurtzel said. "You may have to refresh people's interest or knowledge about that show months later. ... This is a fundamental change in how people have been viewing TV." "Superstore," the NBC sitcom about employees of a Walmart-like retailer, is an example of what the future of TV premieres could look like. Originally slated as a midseason show, "Superstore" first aired in late 2015 as a "sneak peek"-style preview before its actual premiere in January. The ratings (live plus three days of time-shifted viewing) were so-so. But as more episodes aired and the show got a second look from critics, "Superstore" started to look more like a hit in the long haul. It's perhaps telling, then, that NBC is sending only three new scripted shows into this fall's sacrificial volcano - family drama "This Is Us"; adventure drama "Timeless"; and afterlife comedy "The Good Place." (Two of these - "This Is Us" and "Timeless" - are the kind of shows I'd like to see stick around, while "The Good Place" feels expendable. But then, it wouldn't be the fall season if all of it didn't feel cancelable.) CBS has six new shows this fall, ABC has five and Fox has four. Adding up all the new cable and streaming dramas and comedies premiering between Labor Day and Christmas, I count around 50 scripted shows. This includes HBO, which is launching four scripted series in coming weeks; even Netflix, Hulu and Amazon, which have no bottom-line reason to sell a "season" to viewers or advertisers, have directed some of their biggest offerings in 2016 to the fall. If you think you make the best television, then fall is still the time to prove it. There are creators who still want to win that game the old-fashioned way. "It actually is surprising sometimes," said Jennifer Salke, NBC's president of entertainment. "Someone will come in who I know could walk into any streaming platform and have a 13-episode order, (but) really wants to crack the network thing because they grew up on NBC and that's where they want to work." In other ways, the fall TV model can sometimes have a negative impact on a network's brand. CBS is coming under a lot of criticism for the lack of diversity - and imagination - in its six fall shows. Rolled out separately, over many months, these shows might have been judged on their own merits. But by packaging them together as fall shows, CBS essentially tells viewers that five of its best and brightest ideas in the year 2016 are shows that all star white guys in their 40s and 50s - Kevin James, Matt LeBlanc, Joel McHale, Michael Weatherly and Dermot Mulroney. (CBS' other bright idea is a new "MacGyver.") "We need to do better and we know it," said CBS's president of entertainment, Glenn Geller, pointing out some gains in diversity among ensemble casts and in the number of episode directors on some series. "That's really it. We need to do better. ... These are the shows we picked up. We pick up the best shows from the pilots we make." Geller's reference to "the pilots we make" is a reminder that fall TV begins months earlier as a series of time-honored rituals and business-as-usual: There's a pilot-making frenzy in the spring, which leads to the "upfronts" in May and the presentation of a prime-time schedule, at which point advertisers make decisions about where and what to buy. The reason fall TV is still a thing, after all, is that it serves as a stage upon which many billions of dollars in advertising revenue are at stake, in an industry that reports a gross profit margin of 40 to 50 percent on average. Despite everything you read in the business pages about cord-cutters and consumer clout, television done the usual way makes big bucks. (Doubling down on sitcoms starring Kevin James and Matt LeBlanc might be viewed as a savvy business grab for the mainstream, no matter how much cultural heartburn it gives critics.) "For 60 years, television, given the massive generational, behavioral, and technological shifts, has managed to change ... not so much (the world still sits in front of a television)," writes media critic Michael Wolff in his succinctly argued 2015 book, "Television Is the New Television: The Unexpected Triumph of Old Media in the Digital Age." "And yet (TV) is always, no matter its continued success, ubiquity, and cultural centrality, about to be swept away." Likewise, fall TV is still a thing because the streaming revolution has yet to produce a comparable moneymaker and attention-grabber. And to that we must also consider the ineffable, sentimental attachment. The memory of when the "FALL PREVIEW" issue of TV Guide, thick as the New Testament, would arrive at supermarket checkout lines and you'd beg your mother to buy it, so you could circle all the new shows you planned to watch.

 These charts show how Amazon is blowing away competitors — and its lead is growing Eugene Kim Sep. 16, 2016, 12:58 PM 5,123 facebook linkedin twitter email print Amazon is absolutely killing it in online retail and its lead continues to grow, according to a new note published by RBC Capital on Thursday. The note shared a number of charts to illustrate this point, based on the results of a recent survey it ran against 2,024 people, of whom 1,682 had shopped on Amazon over the past 12 months. The first chart shows that Amazon is the clear mindshare winner when it comes to online retail. Its rivals like eBay, Walmart, and Target lag far behind Amazon in terms of visit frequency. And Amazon's lead over second place eBay has widened over the past year. RBC Capital The next chart shows where Amazon stands when people evaluate three of the most important shopping criteria — price, selection, and conveneince. Again, Amazon maintains a strong lead over its competitors in all 3 areas: RBC Capital Perhaps the most impressive part is that Amazon is doing all this while keeping its customer satisfaction rate high. According to the survey, a whopping 85% of current Amazon customers said they're "extremely" or "very" satisfied, while only 2% said they were "slightly satisfied" or "not at all" satisfied. RBC Capital But what should be most concerning to other retailers is that all of this is leading to higher purchase frequency on Amazon.com. Now, an estimated 47% of Amazon customers make at least 2 to 3 purchases a month, up from last year's 42%, the survey says.

(View our Privacy Policy) Donald Trump's strength in Florida shows in working-class Pasco County Adam C. Smith, Times Political Editor Link View all Articles ADAM C. SMITHTampa Bay Times Friday, September 16, 2016 12:16pm Print 0 My Edition I want to see more articles tagged I'm already following articles tagged Previous Next Previous Next HOLIDAY — Donald Trump's prospects for winning the White House will probably rise or fall among the strip malls and 1,000-square-foot ranch homes of southwest Pasco County. Related News/Archive Donald Trump won Florida on strength of suburban white vote 1 Week Ago Donald Trump's path to the White House runs through Pennsylvania and its working-class white voters 5 Months Ago Hillary Clinton pulls no punches on Donald Trump in Pasco 2 Weeks Ago In this working-class suburb of Tampa Bay, finding people enthusiastically supporting Hillary Clinton is tough. Finding people enthusiastically supporting Trump is less difficult. Finding people fed up with the status quo is a piece of cake. "It's not that I like Trump that much, it's that I dislike Hillary so much. I don't think (Barack) Obama did anything for us, and I see it continuing with Hillary. At least with Trump, there's a chance for some change, and I'm all for change," said 66-year-old retiree Ken Seekford, plunging into a bowl of soup at Jimmy's Restaurant in downtown New Port Richey. A lifelong Democrat who moved to Pasco from Maryland two years ago, Seekford is so turned off by Clinton that he switched his registration to Republican after watching the Democratic National Convention. "Look at everything she was caught in," he said. "With those emails, somebody asks her, 'Did you wipe your hard drive?' And she says, 'What do you mean, with a rag?' Come on, she's smarter than that." Trump can't win the presidency without winning Florida, and many observers question how he can win Florida if he fails to do better among Florida's one in three minority voters. That's not expected to happen. So how is it that poll after poll shows Trump running neck-and-neck with Clinton, with a real shot at winning Florida's 29 electoral votes? The answer lies behind the Advanced Auto Parts and Big Lots stores along U.S. 19, in 40-year-old subdivisions with names like Holiday Lakes Estates, Beacon Square and Regency Park. Those who divide Florida into political territories call this corner of Pasco County Florida House District 36. And unlike the vast majority of legislative districts across America, the roughly 100,000 voters here tend to be independent-minded and unpredictable. Thirty-five percent are registered Republicans, 34 percent Democrats and 31 percent belong to neither party. In 2008 and in 2012, Obama narrowly carried Florida House District 36, and narrowly won Florida. But a poll of likely voters taken in July by a Democratic polling firm found Trump with a double-digit lead over Clinton — 51 percent to 39 percent — in this district. • • • Southwest Pasco County looks tailor-made for Trump: 90 percent white, nearly 90 percent without college degrees, median household income of about $34,000. Also, widespread anxiety over crime and a deteriorating quality of life. In the 1970s, this was a blue-collar retirement mecca that attracted Northeasterners who could buy a comfortable two-bedroom ranch with attached garage for $10,000. Many of these same homes sold for more than $140,000 during the peak of the housing bubble in 2006, only to see their values plummet to less than $50,000 today. The numbers help explain how Trump is defying the conventional political wisdom that Florida's fast-changing demographics will make the state a steep climb for a Republican nominee so weak among minority voters. That conventional wisdom also may underestimate Clinton's unpopularity based on conversations inside the VFW post, outside the Walmart and inside Jimmy's Restaurant. "She should be in jail, and you or me would be if we did what she did with those emails," said Dorothy Jay of Holiday over lunch at Jimmy's with her husband. "At least Trump is not going to be taking payoffs from people wanting something." "I don't trust her, and we don't need another four years of Obama," said Alan Jay, who moved with his wife to the area from Long Island in 1994. "Trump's problem is that he has diarrhea of the mouth. He speaks before he thinks, but what comes out of his mouth is honest." Republican pollster Wes Anderson, who works for the Rebuilding America Now super PAC helping Trump, said Clinton has at least as much to do with Trump's strength in Florida as Trump. "Everyone talks about Trump's negatives, and we kind of miss the point that Hillary Clinton has just as strong negatives as he does — and in some ways hers are more telling," Anderson said. "This is a change election, and she is anything but that. Whether she likes it or not, she wears the mantle of the political establishment. ... That is actually what's happening in Florida." Even as Clinton dramatically outspends Trump on TV ads in Florida and builds a more robust voter-turnout operation, the candidates are virtually tied. The average of recent Florida polls compiled by RealClearPolitics.com on Friday had Trump with 45.1 percent support and Clinton with 44.4 percent. "The assumption is it's because Trump is running up the score in the markets where Republicans have to run up the score when they win Florida," said Anderson. "I think that's only half of the story. There are lots of places where she is underperforming, and I do think it's going to come down to Tampa and Orlando." Candidates and political operatives in competitive legislative races in Hillsborough and Pinellas counties say they see Trump running much stronger than expected. Democratic state Rep. Amanda Murphy represents District 36 and keeps her distance from Clinton while knocking on doors or talking with residents, many of whom recently experienced severe flooding from Hurricane Hermine. She said she understands the sentiments of Trump backers she encounters. "People do want change, and I understand that," said Murphy, who stresses to people that she is not a lifelong politician and is focused on Tallahassee, not Washington. The district used to be represented by Republican Mike Fasano, now Pasco's tax collector, who said he hears plenty of anecdotal evidence about Trump's strength. "I don't know that they are as much in love with Donald Trump as they are disgusted with the whole process, and they have been disgusted by it for years," Fasano said. "People are just tired of the old regimes in Washington, whether it be Republicans or Democrats, and whether it's Mitch McConnell or John Boehner or Hillary Clinton. They're just tired of it. They feel understandably like they're not being told the truth, and they're tired of being pushed aside." Even if Trump wins this district comfortably, he could lose Florida. Charlie Crist, the populist Republican-turned-Democratic candidate for governor, beat Rick Scott by 10 percentage points here in 2014 but still lost narrowly statewide. • • • Four years ago, Mitt Romney lost this district to Obama by 2,404 votes, or nearly 4 percentage points. But this year's super wealthy Republican nominee is connecting far better with the blue-collar voters of Pasco than 2012's super wealthy nominee. Among the transplanted Northeasterners, Trump is more Queens than Wall Street. "Trump works with laborers and goes up and pats them on the back. Hillary doesn't do that," said Seekford, sitting at Jimmy's. "Hillary doesn't even want to touch a commoner. It might rub off on her." At Jimmy's with his wife, 84-year-old Democrat Joe Trumbauer talked about how tough it is caring for his wife with Alzheimer's because he can't afford help. He's a loyal Democrat, a former Mack Truck auto worker from Allentown, Pa., but is intrigued by Trump. "We didn't get a Social Security raise in the last two or three years — and that's Democrats in the White House," Trumbauer said. "I do in a way want to vote for Trump, but I'm afraid to because I don't know what he's going to do." Even Clinton supporters in the area sounded sheepish about supporting her. Inside Randolph Ford VFW Post 7845 in Port Richey, where most of the boisterous men and women at the bar said they liked Trump, retired Air Force veteran John Rodgers, 80, said Clinton supporters like himself tend to be more low-key. "It's because she's been in politics for so long,'' Rodgers said. "It's hard to get excited about and trust someone who's been in politics so long." Contact Adam Smith at asmith@tampabay.com.

How To Check Toys R Us, Gamestops And Walmarts Near You By Bob Fekete On 09/16/16 AT 12:26 PM Close The Pokémon Go Plus is now available in North America for $34.99. Want to get one of your very own? Here’s the best tips for avoiding long lines and making sure your store has one in stock. Your best bet before you get going is to simply make a few phone calls to stores in your area. While Nintendo hasn’t really said where you can buy a Pokémon Go Plus, GameStop definitely has them in stock. Be sure to find your nearest store or two using the Store Locator, and call to see if they can set one aside for you. If GameStop isn’t your thing, try giving some of the big-box retailers a try. Target, Toys R Us and Best Buy frequently have new video games, and if there’s money to be made you know Wal-Mart will be getting in on the fun as well. Each of those links will take you to the respective retailer’s store finder. If you happen to live in New York City, Polygon is reporting the Nintendo World Store has Pokémon Go Plus units in stock, but there is a long line and only one is being sold per customer. The store also declined to comment on how many were in stock. If you are truly Poké-crazed, you can buy one off of Amazon. Beware, these are third-party retailers, so the cheapest Pokémon Go Plus unit is over $85. Related Stories Pokémon Go Plus Releases Tomorrow With Obvious Shortcomings ‘Pokémon Go' Multiplayer, PvP And Other Features Teased Apple Watch owners may want to hold off on getting a Pokémon Go Plus of their own, since its features will come to Apple Watch in the future. There has been no release window given for this update to the Apple Watch, however. Anecdotally, a co-worker has found a Pokémon Go Plus at his local GameStop, but mentioned it was the last one in stock. If you’re still not exactly sure what the Pokémon Go Plus actually does, it’s a device that allows you to play Pokémon Go without looking at your phone. The device is worn like a watch, and lights up and vibrates when you are near a PokéStop or when a Pokémon appears. You can click the button on the Pokémon Go Plus to search the PokéStop or try and catch the wild Pokémon, all without having to take your phone out of your pocket. So what do you think? Are you interested in getting a Pokémon Go Plus of your own? Do you think you’ll just play Pokémon Go like you have been already? Let us know your thoughts in the comments section below.

Officers arrived and quickly located the suicidal man, 29, seated in a parked vehicle on the lot. Officers had information that the suicidal man was armed with a handgun. Officers attempted to create a dialogue with the individual. The man did not respond to officers commands. A perimeter was established to ensure the safety of store patrons and the Crisis Negotiation Team was summoned to the scene. After failing to establish communication with the individual, members of the Harford County Municipal SWAT Team approached the man’s vehicle. They quickly determined the man had sustained head trauma. Officers took immediate action to provide medical attention; however, the individual was already deceased. Crime scene investigators determined the man sustained a single self-inflicted gunshot wound. The male was transported to the Office of the State Medical Examiner for further examination.

Chairman Butch Rice and Gary Jaworski, a member of the Arkansas Road Team, direct traffic to Thursday's Driver Appreciation Day picnic. Related Media Money, happiness and truck driver pay Engagement key to lowering early driver turnover rates Truck Drivers: Where the jobs are, and what they pay N. LITTLE ROCK, AR. A steady flow of truck drivers took advantage of their midday break periods to follow the “Free Lunch” signs to the front parking lot at the Petro on I-40 here, where tents provided some relief from the late summer heat and where dozens of volunteers, TA-Petro staff, and performers said “thank you” during the Arkansas Trucking Assn.’s annual Truck Driver Appreciation day event. “One of the top three reasons drivers leave a company is they get no appreciation,” says Arkansas Trucking Assn. Chairman Butch Rice, President and CEO of the Stallion Transportation Group, as he waives a sign at passing drivers, shouting over diesel engine noise and truck horns to invite them stop in. “That’s a big deal to the them—a pat on the back.” And “it’s time,” he says, as fleets struggle to keep seats filled—and then pay a high price to replace drivers who leave. Stallion, which runs 74 company-owned trucks, has an annual turnover rate of 81 percent, Rice reports—well below the national average, but still significant enough to be very concerned about. Popular Now New overtime regulations: Are you ready? Reaching for driver retention solutions Navistar to create “open” truck telematics ecosystem The problem for most fleets, he suggests, is that management is “wrapped up” in handling regulatory compliance and other operational issues. Rice says carriers need to have someone on staff dedicated to driver appreciation “to do it right.”  At Stallion, the company hosts monthly driver recognition events and maintains a company store for free merchandise, and they’ve also upgraded equipment, added benefits, and make sure drivers get home. But part of the problem is how easy it is for driver’s to leave, he notes. “There’s not too many industries where you can quit at 8 o’clock and be working somewhere else by 12,” Rice says, then notes it’s not unusual to get applications from drivers with work histories from a half dozen companies over the past couple of years—and, if they’re qualified, it’s hard to turn them down. “You could do a hundred loads perfect, but if the driver has one bad day, they know they can turn a truck in and go right down the street and get another job. We have to mind our ‘P’s and ‘Q’s and we work at it.” Indeed, driver retention is a two-way street, agrees Gary Jaworski, a driver for Walmart Transportation and a member the Arkansas Road Team. For Jaworski, the most important thing a company can do to show appreciation is to make good on home-time promises. “People really want to spend more time with their families, to stay connected with the people they love,” he says. “Most drivers love their jobs, but they love their families more.” He’s been with Walmart for 25 years, and he believes driving jobs for Walmart are sought after not just for the industry-leading pay, but because pay is just one way the company “treats us with respect.” “They’re always asking, ‘what can we do to make your job better?’” Jaworski says. “If we have an issue or have a problem, they’re there to resolve that issue. And it doesn’t always work out in our favor, but they look at ways to make sure we’re happy and the customers are happy. There’s a mutual respect—that’s one reason I continue to work there.” This year’s Driver Appreciation Day would feed some 600 truckers, estimates ATA President Shannon Newton. As an association leader, she tries to keep members informed as to best practices for retaining drivers—and she points out the driver appreciation event pre-dates any driver shortage. She adds that volunteers turn out to serve the drivers each year knowing that very few of the hot dogs, hamburgers, and gift bags are going to Arkansas truckers. More important than picnics, however, is the need for state and national trucking associations to educate the public about the critical role professional drivers play in the economy. “People need to understand the lifestyle, and that drivers choose to make a living doing this—they need to understand that there are human beings involved, people with families, that are driving those trucks that are delivering the groceries,” Newton says. “It’s important to overcome the perception of the industry, which is sometimes negative by default. If we’re successful, people will be more empathetic and more appreciative of drivers—and that benefits everyone.” Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Please Log In or Register to post comments.

Opening day drew a crowd to the doors of the new Nordstrom store at Toronto Eaton Centre on Friday.  (Andrew Francis Wallace/The Toronto Star)   By David OliveBusiness Columnist Fri., Sept. 16, 2016 Two years after the spectacular flameout of Target Canada, why would another U.S.-based department store merchant, Nordstrom Inc., take a chance on the often perilous Canadian market? Seattle-based Nordstrom, which opened its first GTA store Friday at the Toronto Eaton Centre and opens a second store at Yorkdale Shopping Centre next month, is also an upscale merchant chancing a Canadian market that did not support discounter Target. At a time when Canadian household debt is at near-record levels, the Target Canada post-mortem of analysts that Canadian consumers are skin-flinted would seem to augur poorly for Nordstrom. The same applies to Lowe’s, the U.S. hardware and home furnishings chain, and the venerable Quebec department store chain La Maison Simons, also rolling the dice on Canadian expansions. But that hasty Target Canada post-mortem was wrong. A Target struggling with unprecedented problems in its home market failed to do its homework on Canada. It offered prosaic goods available cheaper at Walmart Canada, and was chronically out of stock because of a dysfunctional distribution system. And it over-reached in its first non-U.S. market, starting out with 124 Canadian stores. That included haphazardly retrofitted former Zellers outlets in rundown malls, or hidden behind abandoned warehouses. Article Continued Below So far, Nordstrom has plans for just six Canadian stores, in Calgary, Vancouver, Toronto and Ottawa. Two years passed between the opening of Nordstrom’s first Canadian store, in Calgary, and the GTA store openings this month. Another year will pass before the 2017 opening of a third GTA store, at Sherway Gardens (another MVP mall). “We have a healthy dose of humility,” co-president Erik Nordstrom told Toronto Star business reporter Francine Kopun ahead of the firm’s Calgary opening. “We will look to respond to customer comments right off the bat.” In fact, Target’s loss of its entire investment in Canada, some $2.6 billion, said little about Canadian consumers, and a great deal about a Target coping badly with the first major reversals in its then 49-year history. Those setbacks included Target’s unwise shift away from the “cheap chic” offerings that had made it a viable competitor to Wal-Mart. The firm was also hit with one of the biggest security breaches in history when data on millions of its customers was hacked. Nordstrom’s winning formula, whose key is above-average customer service, hasn’t changed despite e-commerce and other innovations. And though it is publicly traded, Nordstrom is still a family affair, 115 years after it was founded by John W. Nordstrom as a shoe store in Seattle. Today the company is run by three “co-presidents” with the surname Nordstrom. To be sure, some retailers in Canada have stumbled, including Danier Leather, Le Château and Nine West. But upscale merchants Cartier, Hermès, Tiffany & Co. and Saks Fifth Avenue have done just fine. A financially stronger firm than Target, Nordstrom has the resources to make a success of its Canadian adventure. Revenues at Nordstrom grew smartly last year, to $18.9 billion, or 6.9 per cent. (All figures in Canadian dollars.) Nordstrom’s average annual revenue growth over the past five years is 6.6 per cent, impressive in a slow-growth era for department stores. Nordstrom is not without its challenges, including a stock price that has underperformed the U.S. retail/wholesale stock index since mid-2015. That’s a reflection of the firm’s five-year average annual profit growth of -2.4 per cent. Nordstrom’s traditional full-size stores, which still account for the bulk of company sales, are a drag on profits. They are caught in the same malaise afflicting the whole department-store sector. Specialty stores long ago began eroding department stores’ share of major product categories. And more recently, online shopping is also taking its toll. Amazon’s offerings are ever expanding. And “web-first” specialty online merchants are ubiquitous. Traditional retailers, from pharmacies to car dealerships, also have to contend with “showrooming.” That trend has consumers deciding on their purchase at a conventional store, but then buying the item elsewhere after doing an online price comparison. But Nordstrom has more staying power than its peers. Sales are booming at its more than 150 U.S. discount Nordstrom Rack stores, one of which is planned for the GTA’s Vaughan Mills shopping centre in 2018. And Nordstrom’s mainline stores are faring better than rivals. An industry-leading 62 per cent of Nordstrom’s mainline outlets are in the 95 “MVP” (most valuable property) shopping centres among America’s 2,101 malls. MVPs boast the most affluent shoppers. The comparable number for Macy’s is a mere 11 per cent. Nordstrom thus selected for its first Canadian store the Chinook Centre, Calgary’ largest shopping mall. The firm’s two GTA outlets, the Eaton Centre and Yorkdale, are also classic MVP malls. So is Sherway Gardens, where a Nordstrom is scheduled to open next year. ▶ American retailer Nordstrom opens its first Canadian store in Calgary with shoppers lining up for hours.(Todd Korol for the Toronto Star) Nordstrom has built one of the most formidable e-commerce infrastructures in retailing, from state-of-the-art distribution centres to specialized shopping apps. Today Nordstrom derives an astonishing 21 per cent of its revenue from digital sales, at a time when mediocrity marks the online presence of most conventional retailers. Nordstrom got a jump on e-commerce years ago by snapping up popular online merchants Hautelook and Trunk Club. It also gets a cut from the web-first merchants to which it provides space in its high-traffic stores, including Madewell, a fast-growing women’s casual apparel unit of New York’s J. Crew Group Inc. The combination of Nordstrom’s enviable locations and its prowess in e-commerce has made Nordstrom the first choice for web-first merchants seeking a bricks-and-mortar presence to increase their visibility. And Nordstrom continues to double down on e-commerce. It recently bought online men’s fashion merchant Bonobos. And it has taken an equity stake in Shoes of Prey, a digital retailer that enables women to customize shoes online. “Nordstrom’s high exposure to MVP malls makes it the most attractive wholesale distribution partner for both emerging traditional and online-born brands,” Credit Suisse analyst Michael Exstein wrote in a recent client note. As it happens, Nordstrom will bring to Canada something that even a successful Target Canada would not have, namely a treasure-house of quality and trendy brands, in addition to its lavishly appointed bricks-and-mortar emporia. The Nordstrom that opened Friday at the Toronto Eaton Centre boasts a cocktail lounge, espresso bar and children’s playhouse – amenities aimed at keeping customers in the store longer. If Target Canada is a case history of multi-dimensional failure, a Nordstrom that brings its first-in-class online savvy to Canada will force incumbent Canadian retailers to raise their game. It will be a free lesson on how to stay relevant in a volatile retailing world. Read more about: United States, Nordstrom The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.

Published Wed, Nov 26, 2014  |  Floyd Brown, Political Expert Amazon (AMZN) started Black Friday deals early, but don’t count me in this year. I’ve been a customer of Amazon almost from the beginning, when all they delivered were books. I don’t know how many thousands of dollars of merchandise I’ve ordered over the years, but it’s likely in the tens of thousands. I adopted Amazon because it fit my busy lifestyle. Instead of having to visit Wal-Mart (WMT) and hustle from aisle to aisle… just to wait in a long line to pay for my merchandise… Amazon allowed me to buy with a few clicks and find the product at my doorstep just days later. But after making its worst business decision ever, I will forever boycott using the site. And I might not be alone… At first, Amazon’s premium service, Amazon Prime, improved on the customer experience. With no shipping and two-day delivery, there was no way to beat it. My Amazon purchases exploded. In fact, I was so addicted to Amazon last year that I spent most of Black Friday on the site completing my Christmas list. No need to fight the crowds at the mall. No need for rain checks. Heck, they even delivered my out-of-town gifts directly to the intended recipient. All of this joy is over now, however… Serious Lapse in Judgment If you’re a regular Amazon customer, you’ve likely noticed a change. Amazon dropped the United Parcel Service (UPS), and it increased shipping with the United States Postal Service (USPS). Amazon made a deal with the Devil, and the customers are now required to pay. Let me explain… When the deal was announced, the U.S. Postal Service thought it was the lifeline it needed to survive. Since bills and most correspondence now come via email – and checks are often delivered by Automated Clearing House (ACH) – the USPS has lost its reason to exist. Mail volume has plummeted and most of the mail delivered these days never makes it past the trash can into the house. They’re bleeding financially. Now, Amazon pays huge delivery fees, and it’s looking to build its own fleet of trucks and vehicles to deliver packages. Instead, it thought it had a match made in heaven: Take the excess capacity of the USPS, and make it the delivery system for Amazon. Makes sense, right? But there’s a major problem with the equation. Amazon is going from being the best firm at delivering products… to being one of the worst. From Pick-Up Lines to Picket Lines In the past, the United Parcel Service would leave the parcels at your doorstep. Instead, USPS wants to cram it into your mailbox. But if you miss your mail for a day or the package doesn’t fit into your mailbox, you’re out of luck… the parcels end up back in the dead letter room at your local post office. So instead of delivery, the Amazon customer has to go to pick up the package at the Post Office. That’s a line even more dreaded than Wal-Mart’s. Americans hate standing in the USPS line. And this is what’s happening to thousands of Amazon customers around the nation. Instead of enjoying the delivery of Amazon Prime, you’re now faced with the hell of waiting in the line at the Post Office. What sounded like a good idea on paper is a disaster for the Amazon customer. I wonder if Jeff Bezos and the other leaders of Amazon know what they’re doing to their own customers. If this keeps up, they soon will.

Comments (246) Lonnie Philpott says: November 26, 2014 at 6:29 am Not much different at UPS. Every time I order something it seems there is a reason why it cannot be left at the house so a trip to the UPS office is in order and their lines and lack of caring is as bad or worse than USPS. I, for one, get better service from USPS. [Reply] V Paiva Reply: November 26th, 2014 at 12:04 pm Not only is a trip to UPS as bad as USPS, but here where I live I have to travel to another city to the UPS terminal. There isn’t one in this city. [Reply] Heather Reply: January 27th, 2015 at 12:59 pm My issue with the USPS delivery is that to fulfill their Amazon two day obligation they mark the package as delivered when they never even came to my house. Has happened at least ten times. This is hurting small business owners who use USPS and then have to eat the coast of the first order. I’ve called the post office before and I know they are lying about the delivery and I say that I will report it to the shipper and they just say “go ahead”. They have to scan a bar code on my mailbox for mail delivery. Not sure why they wouldn’t have to do that for packages. It’s a total scam. [Reply] Richard Reply: March 26th, 2015 at 11:44 am I agree! This has happened to me as well. I was definitely home early and awaiting my package in the room where a knock or doorbell would have definitely been heard. Screw them. My item was cheap. I’ll just not pick it up at all and they have send it back costing them more labor as I order my item from some place else. I don’t mind picking it up if they had actually come and missed me but they definitely lied in my case. Mike Reply: April 23rd, 2015 at 7:31 pm This has happened to me several times recently. Our post office here in Corpus Christi says they “attempted delivery” but I was home each time and the doorbell never rang. I have had to wait until Saturday, when I am not working, to drive up to the post office to pick up my package. They have lost a priority mailed package and certified letter as well in recent weeks. I ask for a manager and the are always conveniently unavailable and never return my calls. I am done with USPS, and if Amazon doesn’t begin to offer options other than USPS I will cancel my prime membership and be done with Amazon. WhyMeLord Reply: August 8th, 2015 at 2:02 pm I can receive a package from China faster than I can a package sent one (small) town over. FWIW I can walk to that shipper’s location faster than USPS delivers. The problem has gotten so bad that on our purchase orders we advise vendors that any package shipped via USP is at their risk. USP tracking confirms the deliver two or three days BEFORE it is delivered. Complaints to Postal inspector are ignored. A letter to the Postmaster by name sent to the Washington Office the address was provided by my congress critter) was returned stamped “Addressee Unknown” david Reply: January 11th, 2016 at 10:21 pm The barcode they scan on your mailbox has nothing to do with your deliver of mail. That is scanned to show where they are at a given time and would be scanned regardless of whether you had mail or not. I’m curious why you people have so many problems having Amazon packages not delivered. 99% of the packages that Amazon sends out are sent “carrier-leave if not response” meaning the packages should be left whether you’re home or not. I’d drop that on the post office next time you call. Leaving that isn’t even optional for the carrier. great grandma Reply: February 13th, 2016 at 8:42 am Two companies that I ordered on line from,one sent UPS,but had them delivered to the Post Office,the other sent Fed Ex,who they also delivered to the Post Office.I will not order from either of these companies again.Ask who will be delivering your package,but make sure you ask if that company will be making that delivery to your home. Mike Reply: March 3rd, 2016 at 10:19 am Exactly right. This mostly happens for Sunday delivery. They simply will not deliver on Sunday. They lie about trying. I have been home and nothing was left on the door AND it was marked “LEAVE” which requires nothing else. Magically, the next business day they leave it at the door. Greg Brandeau Reply: December 30th, 2014 at 3:51 am I’m not sure if it is where I live (LA) or something else, but both USPS and UPS are terrific at leaving packages at my house that won’t fit in my mailbox and/or that need to be signed for. In addition, both UPS and USPS allow you to re-route your package or sign for your package on their websites. My experience with Amazon and USPS over the holidays has been fantastic! Same with UPS. [Reply] Andrew R. Reply: March 12th, 2015 at 7:50 pm I live in Baton Rouge, LA. I have had the same experience. However, my friends and family do not. I think it depends on the letter carrier and their delivery schedule. My packages always come to my doorstep on time. I have relatives that have home security cameras. We have evidence of the letter carrier leaving a notice in their mailbox instead of attempting a delivery. As a result of this, they only choose the one day shipping on Amazon so that UPS or FedEx will make a successful delivery. [Reply] Dawn N Reply: May 30th, 2015 at 9:54 pm I chose 1 day delivery, and it’s being shipped via USPS. JJthe DAGGER Reply: June 29th, 2015 at 8:45 pm I don’t get this. I’m a carrier with the USPS and I would rather deliver a package then sit in front of your mailbox and fill out a slip for you to pick the package up at the USPS, haul your package around all day and then haul it back into the office. I really can’t comprehend why any carrier would do this when most days you barely have any room to move. I question the validity of your responses. Think about what I just wrote because this leaving notices and hauling a full truck of parcels back to unload at the local USPS doesn’t sound realistic. I think most of you just have an ax to grind and decided to talk out of your rears. steven Reply: May 7th, 2015 at 8:56 am I work for the USPS and we are instructed to leave parcels at the doorstep unless it’s not considered safe or bad weather [Reply] Charlene Reply: October 21st, 2015 at 12:40 pm Well, you don’t work for every state now do you! People are not going to find the time to come on here and make a crazy remarks for the fun of it. I have been a amazon customer since 2000 and postal service has slacked off for about a year now in my area. I don’t get my packages left on my premises even though its secured and of course I am the one who is placing the order so I am fully aware that I would not be home to receive it. People do work and that was the benefit for becoming a prime member in the first place and be able to enjoy the 3 day delivery. Even now requesting redelivery attempts are not made until after my 3 requests on the USPS website. I don’t see the logic is wasting gas to come all the way to my home just to go back and dump it at the post office. If this is the method that supervisors are telling their workers to get people to come into the Post office then its a dumb idea. I can have a tiny amazon package that has a scented oil in the box go back to the post office! It’s ludicrous. Sm Reply: November 28th, 2015 at 4:50 am Same here. Been with USPS for a year. Its a total pain in the a$$ to bring parcels back with me. The only way I do is if the business is closed or it’s a signature confirmation and they weren’t home. RachelK Reply: February 7th, 2016 at 10:33 am The issues we have with nondelivery are that the carrier doesn’t even bring the packages, because my spouse has met him at the mailbox while he was filling out the slip and my spouse asked where the package was and the carrier responded that he left it back at the post office. We’ve also had A LOT of packages stolen, even spoke with an 1811 who said they are aware there are a lot of thefts going on and there is an active investigation (in other words, tough luck to us.) As I type this, I’ve had a puppet that I ordered for my play therapy kit marked as delivered, and it never was. Sadly, most of what disappears through the Houston Street office is toys (both sending and receiving.) and identification (My husband was notified that his DL was being used by someone else, the DL that disappeared at the Houston St office 3x.) I will probably order my books and play therapy stuff through other sellers that use UPS or Fed Ex. My Amazon Prime account though, I may just not renew because we never use it like netflix, and with everything going through USPS (meaning I may not get everything) it’s not worth the money. Joe Reply: July 2nd, 2015 at 4:21 pm I’m on hold with UPS right now and Amazon and I are begging them to allow store pick-up as I won’t be home to sign for the package. Instead of working with Amazon to fulfill MY request, this is supposed to be about me I thought, UPS is insistent they most uphold the terms of their contract with Amazon though we are requesting flexibility to fulfill my request. I guess it’s more important that the contract, which I’m not party to, be upheld despite Amazon’s request then the sale be completed. I thought “the market” was about responsiveness to customer needs? [Reply] sam Reply: October 26th, 2016 at 7:45 pm The customer you refer to is not the receiver of the package; for the delivery company their customer is the shipper who pays the postage.

[Reply] Mego Reply: July 15th, 2015 at 6:56 pm I am a Seattleite that is fed up with this “deal with the devil” Amazon has made with USPS. Amazon’s poor choice of shipping results in many lost hours & frustration to me, the customer. As a business owner, the hours I spend tracking down shipments, calling their customer service for refunds, not to mention the time I spent researching and ordering the items I chose to begin with – makes AMAZON the most COSTLY PLACE for me to spend money anymore. USPS will not even get out of their truck to walk a package to your front door. Nor do I have an option of choosing a delivery method that is reliable for me, the CUSTOMER. I just spent 45 minutes on the phone to cancel almost $700 worth of merchandise I purchased within the last couple of days. I received that same text message everyone else is talking about here: “Delivery Attempted: We were not able to deliver your Amazon package with Fujitsu ScanSnap IX 500 Scanner and 4 other items. We’ll try again tomorrow. Then it leaves tracking information.” When I log into my account it says I need to look for the Notice left on my door for further instructions. No Notice. Why? Because they didn’t even bother to get their lazy you-know-whats out of the truck to walk to the door. I have been waiting since 8:00 this morning and it is now 3:50 pm (PST) Nobody even ‘attempted’ to deliver and they couldn’t care less about the time Amazon’s customer’s waste away from work or other important parts of their lives as AMAZON & USPS continue to disappoint again and again. For condominiums (aka multifamily housing) USPS will only drop everything off at an office location on site wherein it is immediately lost, broken or only open during business hours – which are the same hours everyone else is at work! This is ridiculously frustrating and absolutely NOT “Customer-centric.” I used to have a lot of respect for Jeff Bezos and his philosophy to build a business by creating it from the customer point of view. Obviously he hasn’t googled his own shipping problems for quite a few years as rants about this same issue go back for years. This is nothing new and Amazon stands silent on the issue IGNORING THEIR CUSTOMERS. There are plenty of alternatives and AMAZON PRIME isn’t really worth much without the 2-day shipping guarantee. Buying from e-bay or a MULTITUDE of other online retail stores not to mention just walking into a local store is so much less frustrating and much more satisfying for my overall customer experience. Shame on you Amazon. This Seattleite is taking her business elsewhere from now on. You owe your customers a public apology for this fiasco. [Reply] Jen Reply: September 6th, 2015 at 4:29 pm Amazon bans you permanently from buying on their website if you complain or return items as well! Their attitude is basically you take what we give you regardless of what the terms were when you ordered, or you can stick it you-know-where. Customer-centric – haha what a joke! [Reply] Bmack Reply: August 27th, 2015 at 10:20 pm I work at a post office in Youngstown, Ohio and I ALWAYS choose UPS or FedEx when I have the option.

[Reply] Frank Reply: September 19th, 2015 at 9:30 am I don’t care how my items come ups or fed ex I just prefer not the postal service. The idiots that deliver my mail can’t read. On this route we have yelled for years about wrong house number or wrong street on the mail. For some reason they can’t read the whole address when you call to complain all you get is we got a new carrier again since this walking house to house is too hard for one to stay on the route. I can’t even tell you how many deliveries have been lost both that I know about and never knew. I try to get everything shipped ups instead of USPS at least I know they will deliver it. If I ship something out I have to go to the post office and pay the extra signature required just to make sure it goes to the right place. I laugh every time I see those commercials about the USPS dedication to your mail. I understand there may be mistakes once on awhile but this happens every week for over 3 years now. [Reply] K.

Packages are being sent through FedEx and when the package reaches the nearest city they are given to the USPS adding 3 more days to the shipping. In addition, if a product doesn’t work, the customer has to pay for return shipping and the customer is charged for the original shipping on top of it. Therefore, I ended up paying $8 for a product I don’t have. [Reply] Veronica E Lowe Reply: February 2nd, 2015 at 1:20 pm that handoff only occurs when you use free super saver shipping. this article is about amazon prime. that said, however, I’ve had no problem with either one being left at the door. and have always received any packages with guaranteed delivery dates, on that date. [Reply] Namma Reply: February 6th, 2015 at 11:38 am That’s not true. I’ve been a Prime member for three years and the last seven month have been horrendous in getting a package delivered. One even was labeled Parcel Post even though I have never changed my default Prime Membership shipping method of 2 days. My last order was sent UPS Ground. Amazon is experimenting, however, they fail in that there is NO feedback and no way for the customer to insist on not using certain methods such as SurePost, SmartPost, etc., etc. WE, the customer, KNOW our delivery carriers strengths and weaknesses and Amazon DOES NOT. Nor is there a direct mechanism in place for Amazon to collect customer feedback about shipping and take the no doubt thousands of complaints up with their “shipping partners” as being violations of the contract, IF they included this in the contract. Hopefully they aren’t that stupid. If this continues I will quit Prime. There’s no point to it since the offerings on the remainder of Prime seem to fit a much younger demographic and are not to my taste. Businesses NEED to remember that they NEED the customer more than the customer needs them. If you doubt this simply search – DIY – and see the resurgence in making things on your own cutting out the merchant and the delivery nightmare that many have resorted to. 543 millions results are about what you will get. [Reply] Andrew R. Reply: March 12th, 2015 at 8:00 pm I completely agree. I don’t understand why the customer can’t be given the option to choose the shipping carrier as opposed to the delivery time. All three carriers are more than willing to negotiate and Amazon already has a built in shipping calculator. I wish Amazon would have the options laid out plain and simple, instead of letting the system or seller choose one by default. Example: What Amazon Currently Has: 1 Day Shipping- $3.99 (Guaranteed by March 14, 2015) 2 Day Shipping- FREE (Guaranteed by March 15, 2015) Standard Shipping – FREE (Guaranteed by March 20, 2015) What I Would Like: UPS Next Day Air- $4.99 (Guaranteed by March 14, 2015) FedEx Standard Overnight- $3.99 (Guaranteed by March 14, 2015) USPS Priority Mail Express- $3.99 (Guaranteed by March 14/15, 2015 depending on location) UPS 2nd Day Air- FREE FedEx 2Day- FREE USPS Priority Mail 2/3 Day- FREE UPS Ground- FREE FedEx Home Delivery- FREE USPS Parcel Select- FREE, $1 Back on Prime Membership Cost This way the customer has the option of choosing the delivery time AND shipping carrier. David Reply: June 3rd, 2015 at 8:28 pm Are you high? You can’t understand because your clueless of what the actual cost of shipping is, that’s made abundantly clear with this UPS Next Day Air- $4.99 (Guaranteed by March 14, 2015) FedEx Standard Overnight- $3.99 (Guaranteed by March 14, 2015) USPS Priority Mail Express- $3.99 (Guaranteed by March 14/15, 2015 depending on location) USPS offers flat rate boxes at 44$ But you somehow think your 99 bucks means that amazon should eat 40 bucks. Mego Reply: July 15th, 2015 at 7:00 pm Well said, Namma Tim Reply: August 30th, 2015 at 2:57 pm I agree. Amazon should allow the customer to choose the method – company, speed and cost – of shipping items they want. If you like priority mail, choose USPS, if you like UPS or FEDEX choose them. The company’s shipping matrix is broken. sam Reply: October 26th, 2016 at 7:57 pm GET OFF YOUR REAR END AND GO SHOPPING!!!!!

I used Amazon.com credit card, then it says use the free 2 day since I have prime. Dec 1. it says 2 day, plus I checked weekends are good, too. Friday gets here, no package. Then it is changed to Sunday. They apparently kept driving from central California, past Albany, Oregon another 1.5 hours to Portland. Then took the package all the way back to Albany, close to where I live. I gave them both my Box number and my physical address to make sure I get it. What could go wrong? They locked up my package in Albany and changed it to Dec 8. Now my 2 day delivery is locked up 20 minute from me and will be one week late. Screw Amazon, screw UPS! Screw Amazon credit card. I don’t need them. I have 50 CC’s, others with zero balance. Shove Amazon prime! 15 years of doing business with Amazon, and it just goes downhill. [Reply] Karen Reply: August 20th, 2015 at 7:35 am I worked for UPS for 27 years and recently retired. I can pretty much guarantee that UPS is not losing Amazon. What is happening is UPS and FedEx is contracting with the post office to pick up these packages in bulk from the shipper like Amazon, deliver to the post office and pay $1.00 for each package delivered that can be put in a mailbox. If an address is scanned in the UPS system like a large box that won’t fit in a mailbox and a smaller package is going to same address they are delivered by UPS, but if a small package is the only one going to that address it will be taken to post office for delivery. As drivers we didn’t like this because it held up the package for a day and customers couldn’t understand why it said UPS was delivering but it came by USPS. We could never understand how this could be profitable but I can guarantee that if it wasn’t UPS wouldn’t do it. Hopefully I have cleared up some of this but I may have made it more confusing. [Reply] Joe Reply: September 18th, 2015 at 7:37 am That is completely right. UPS takes packages to almost every post office every day. They give USPS packages that are not cost effective for their delivery person to deliver. [Reply] i hate people Reply: January 4th, 2016 at 3:28 pm No, you guys are dead wrong. I work at USPS, and Amazon made a deal with USPS to allow them to deliver their packages on Sundays. FedEx, UPS, and most carrier companies don’t deliver on Sunday but the post office do now. This is a contract between USPS and Amazon, and it has absolutely nothing to do with UPS and FedEx, and they are losing out in the end. Tom says: November 26, 2014 at 6:48 am Maybe you order things too small. I ordered from Amazon just last week, and UPS delivered yesterday to me. However, much of what FedEx has been charged with delivering by sellers has been coming the final step via USPS. Almost everything that has FedEx charges, USPS delivers to me.

[Reply] Kodster says: November 26, 2014 at 10:10 am I don’t have any problem with Amazon… I’m a Prime member, and I specifically choose a street shipping address in order to get the expedited, guaranteed shipping of 2-days, because I have a PO Box, as well, and that’s my billing address. I’m REQUIRED to have a PO Box in the town I live in, since I live within the city limits. The only issue I have is with FedEx… if they do SmartPost (deliver to the post office, who in turn delivers to me), I don’t have any issues… however, if they are required to deliver directly to my home? Forget it. If I’m lucky, I’ll see the package a week later than it was supposed to be guaranteed to be delivered. UPS… no problems, right on time, and as expected. Point is, we ALL have issues with the delivery systems that Amazon contracts with. Until people get it in their heads that they, as well as we, are customers of each other, and should treat each accordingly (that Golden Rule… treat others as you would want to be treated yourself), nothing is going to change.

And OF COURSE it just happened to me again! Tracking said that it was delivered Monday july 13,2015. And I haven’t seen my package ANYWHERE nor was there even any notices left for me!! I think that the mail lady here COULD POSSIBLY be stealing the amazon packages. Or she’s just so much in a hurry that she could have placed it with one of my neighbors packages. I’ve seen her scanning A LOT of packages ALL ONE AFTER ANOTHER and not put them in the mailbox after each scan. (I was tanning at the pool, mailboxes for our apartment complex is in clear view from the pool). I’ve received my neighbors packages with my packages SOOOOO many times before. I have the courtesy to just hand deliver them to the correct address (knocking at my neighbor’s door, if they aren’t home then I leave it at their front door) . That’s not my job to do that. But I do that only because I KNOW how it feels to lose a package. .. the USPS here in La Verne Had no phone number to call and complain to. No 800 number …nothing.. and the people at the post office don’t even bother to check. When my boyfriend went in there to try to pick up his package that was never delivered, the lady told him to come back later so that she has time to look for it. He came back a few hours later and she said she didn’t get to check yet. He asked her to please go and check, all she did was walk in the doors and walked right back out and said she couldn’t find it…. it’s like WTF??!!

Since USPS workers can access apartment buildings they can reach your apartment directly. This a problem for FedEx and UPS. The difference is that FedEx does allow you to pick up your package after certain hours. Good luck doing this with UPS. Overall, I’m glad that Amazon is not using UPS anymore. [Reply] THE POSTMAN says: November 26, 2014 at 4:11 pm Mr. Brown you can calm your nerves. The USPS has instructions (at least in south east Texas) to leave any Amazon package at the customers door, no matter what. So if you have the type of address where the postman has access to your front door, the package will be left. Have you communicated with your postman? Simple, DIRECT communication with your postman goes a long way to getting those Amazon packages delivered right. [Reply] LINDA Reply: December 15th, 2014 at 1:38 pm Hey Postman, how can I get my mailman to deliver? My Amazon Prime membership now gets me Delivery notices that show delivered but no package. Then if I go to the USPS site it says left at mailbox, which is on a main state highway. The new carrier I have can’t even close the door on the mailbox let alone bring something to my porch like the old carrier did. [Reply] Windy Reply: December 23rd, 2014 at 9:14 pm My post man does the same thing!! He is so lazy. He stuffs a package in my mail box that I have difficulty removing. The door will also not close because the package is too big and sticks four inches or more out. I have reported him twice with no luck. [Reply] Jonathan says: November 26, 2014 at 6:55 pm What is your source for Amazon dropping UPS? I too received a package from Amazon prime via UPS. A light weight package too 2.5lbs. [Reply] Poloko says: November 26, 2014 at 8:18 pm I have been more than thrilled with the service USPS provides with my parcels ordered on Amazon. Never had to make a trip to the post office and most packages arrive within 2 days. My Amazon orders have increased 100% since USPS began delivering them. If your packages go back to the dead letter room at the post office then you have a problem with your post office not USPS as a whole. [Reply] William Doores Reply: February 25th, 2015 at 2:45 pm I think many of the positive responses are being made by Post Office employees. Some of them just out and out lie like saying the package was delivered when it was not. It’s no wonder they are going broke. Good riddance. By the way, don’t tell me to call their supervisor, they don’t answer their phone. [Reply] Robert Pierce says: November 26, 2014 at 9:31 pm My amazon packages shipped via USPS were at my door next to others that came UPS. Overall I’ve had more issues with fed-ex and UPS shipments than USPS. I also recall UPS and Fed-ex failing amazon last Christmas while USPS met the demand. [Reply] Constitutionalist says: November 27, 2014 at 5:04 am I was happy to see this article and that somebody else loathes what Amazon has done. I used Amazon frequently and have been shopping elsewhere now as the delivery time, with their free shipping and use of the USPS, deliveries are usually about 8 days now to my rural address. With UPS, it was 4 to 5 days which is ok to me. [Reply] jen jen says: November 27, 2014 at 6:45 am I boycotted Amazon because they support the big government Democratic party. [Reply] kenneth says: November 27, 2014 at 7:04 am I not sure what is going on with the usps in your city, but the usps is has been delivering most of my amazon purchase for a while now. They always leave the oversized packages on my door step. I also receive my package before ups would deliver them since ups doesn’t come by until after 7pm most nights. This is great news for me that the bulk of shipping will be carried out by usps. [Reply] Tom says: November 27, 2014 at 9:55 am Mr. Brown: sounds like your typical USPS hating republican. Keep up the good work making USPS look bad when their hands are tied because of brilliant legislation by your fellow republicans. [Reply] Jeff W says: November 27, 2014 at 10:18 am I don’t know who the author of this piece is but his bias against the USPS is pretty obvious. Also, he is completely wrong about how USPS delivers. I have worked at the USPS for 20 years , the last 8 have been in a branch office. I see Amazon packages everyday, brought to us from both fed ex and UPS for last mile delivery. On average between both carriers about 500-600 parcels a day, many more right now. I am also a loyal amazon prime customer, and have been for more than 5 years. Gotten many things from them as well. First of all, UPS still delivers Amazon. It does depend on size since UPS started doing dimensional pricing. If it is small, they will probably not deliver. But in some cases they do. I see people everyday come in our PO, complain about our price and say they are going to UPS. They always come back. As far as your package delivery, we leave parcels at places all the time! I have no idea where you live, but unless it is in a place where the carrier think it is unsafe, they will leave that parcel. If they don’t call and complain. Personally I would rather have someone who cares about my security than just leaving it and going. Also, sign the notice left for you and they will received. Happens all the time. This is really another case of some anti federal government idiot who thinks life would be better and his prices lower if we did not exist. We are the only ones that will deliver to every address. That is why the others drop off to us…they can’t deliver to certain places and keep costs down. If we weren’t around, you would be paying through the nose or driving to a centralized pick up point for your parcels. And as far as waiting at the PO for stuff, management has cut our staffing back so much that we cannot keep our unit fully staffed. That is a whole different issue that I would love to discuss with this moron. Bottom line, we do it right and it most cases cheaper. If he has problems I dare say they are of his own creation. This article was a biased piece of untruths and blather. [Reply] Ron W Reply: December 27th, 2014 at 10:43 am Jeff says they do it cheaper than fed-ex or ups. What about the Billions of dollars the post office lose each year. If they had to make a profit like private business does to stay in business. These billion dollar losses have to be paid sooner or later by the tax payers. The USPS would be higher than private services if they had to recoup their cost of doing business and having taxpayers pay. [Reply] Brian Reply: January 25th, 2015 at 1:19 am Usps does not receive any taxpayer money. Do your homework before you say stupid things. Since 2006, the Post Office has been legally required to pre-fund health benefits for future retirees at a cost of around $5.5 billion a year. The only business or branch of the government forced to do this. And none of the is taxpayer money. [Reply] Chas Reply: December 27th, 2014 at 2:40 pm Going with USPS major mistake, at least in my area. Prime 2 day takes 3 to 5 days using USPS. I’ve had a number of packages that “track your package” says it will be delivered by such and such day by 8pm, no way USPS delivers that late. Tracking say delivery attempted- couldn’t leave unattended. In variably the package appears the next day in or on my mail box which several hundred feet from my house next to a major expressway. A Macbook Air was left “unattended” on top of mail box in the rain. Found it before water had reached the laptop. Waiting today for package tracking says will be delivered by 8pm today, BS, won’t see it till Monday. [Reply] Chaupt Reply: February 18th, 2015 at 9:06 pm If the box is say 40-50lbs, USPS has either left if in the middle of my driveway so I have to get out of my car to remove it, or they put an “attempted delivery” notice in my mailbox and make me drive out of my way to go get it after standing in line to turn in the slip and waiting for them to find where the box was stashed and then get a dolly to roll it out to me. Amazon! This is not acceptable. And, yes, I have had the trouble of them smashing items that don’t really fit into the mailbox too! Had to actually cut one apart piece by piece to get at the item inside!! [Reply] Robbie Reply: February 21st, 2015 at 3:52 pm I don’t know if it’s regional or not, but the USPS carrier for my area will not leave any packages at the front door. If it won’t fit in the mailbox, it goes back to the post office. I am disabled and cannot get to the mailbox every day. Things were much better for me when Amazon used UPS and I could get everything delivered to the front door. [Reply] Dan Reply: April 23rd, 2015 at 6:26 pm I don’t have an issue with my carrier, but the USPS has gotten so slow in my area, its plain ridiculous. It takes 7 days for a letter to get from Florida to Maine. Packages that use the USPS take 3-5 days longer than with UPS/FEDEX. Why does it take 2 days for a package to be delivered by my local postman? They tell me it’s because Amazon and some other stores use palletized shipping. It’s great if you are served by a post office serving thousands, but the rural post offices get the stuff when UPS/FEDEX feels like dropping off a pallet. Small PO’s may not get a pallet every day. It’s all about saving money, and I understand, but deliver that slow should be much cheaper than regular FEDEX or UPS. [Reply] Jenna says: November 27, 2014 at 4:32 pm I completely disagree!! It really depends on what you have ordered. I love Amazon like you do. And my brother has an Amazon prime membership as well. I have seen Amazon deliveries coming from UPS as well. I agree USPS delivers most of them BUT I can never blame them for poor service. Most of the times, my package is left at my front porch (behind a pillar) and my area has low theft rate (central CA). And in case the USPS employee takes it along, I do not encounter long lines- cause I know the USPS office opens at 8am when there will be no one there. If I am expecting a delivery today and I am too lazy to get it from the post office, then I’ll be sure to open my door when the postman rings my doorbell. I think Amazon is amazing as usual. Local post offices are closer to homes for a reason. And if they are really that FAR, and the lines are really that long 24/7, then shop at Walmart. 😉 [Reply] Dwiniger says: November 27, 2014 at 7:42 pm So true. Waiting on a watch now. Lost tracking of the item after 3 days when it went to Ohio by mistake. I paid for Prime. Item only needed to ship less than 100 miles from origin to my house. Instead it left the state and nobody knows why or can tell me when to expect delivery. Amazon Prime? USPS? What a waste. Amazon literally laughed at me when I called them. They said to reorder another one. Brilliant advice! Defines insanity right??? [Reply] Steve says: November 27, 2014 at 9:31 pm Normal people would just get on the internet at USPS.com and set up a new deliver date, or just call the toll free number to get the item redelivered. Floyd Brown isn’t the brightest light shining… [Reply] Robert says: November 28, 2014 at 6:52 am This article is absolutely stupid. Anyone can simply call the phone number on back of USPS notice and request a new delivery date or just sign the back and write in when you want your package brought back out, it has a section for that on back if you read the notice then simply put in your mailbox and flip up your flag and they bring it back out on day you request. No lines, No fuss…..I love that Amazon uses USPS now. I seem to get my stuff even faster now. [Reply] Annette says: November 28, 2014 at 7:52 am Starting with Floyd Brown, some of these comments are way off. The USPS does not return the amazon packages that do not fit in your box. As a matter of fact, carriers have specific instruction to leave the package at the door step even if no response at the door. Also, as for the FedEx packages that USPS delivers, it may take FedEx a week to ship to USPS; however carriers are required to deliver no later than next day. Track your shipment on the internet and you’ll see exactly what I’m saying. Stop trash talking, particularly when you obviously do not know what you’re talking about. Facts First! [Reply] Shannon Reply: February 17th, 2015 at 3:10 am Untrue, they WILL claim it doesn’t fit in the box. I was supposed to receive a package today but did not. The tracking shows a notice was left that it was undeliverable due to being too large for the box OR that my box was too full. My box was empty of anything, including a notice of any sort. The Amazon customer service guy told me on his end it showed USPS would deliver tomorrow. Everything the author complains about in this post, I have experienced. I am also fed up with Amazon Prime due solely to their use of our horrible local USPS. [Reply] Amy says: November 28, 2014 at 8:28 am I disagree with the post. I have been using Amazon like you from just about the beginning and yes I have noticed that USPS delivers a lot more, BUT I have never had a problem with packages left by my door or somewhere on my porch if it doesn’t fit. NOT once have I had to go to the post office to pick up. [Reply] Lenny Reply: December 15th, 2014 at 12:48 pm Wrong! USPS leaves a little notification in my mail box stating that I need to pick up the package. I have to leave work early to stand in line at the Post Office. More than six times so far since October of this year. It’s pure laziness. UPS and Fedex ALWAYS delivered to my door. like most, I’m at work during the day when deliveries are suppose to be made. Complaining to my local Post Office hasn’t helped. Coming home to a package waiting for me at the door was what made the Amazon ordering process great. That seems to be over now. I have a large number of co-workers that have the same complaint. Annette, it may be different from your experience however, please do a few Google searches and it will become clear to you that this is a problem for thousands of us. Maybe YOU should get the facts first. [Reply] Jamie F. says: November 28, 2014 at 8:36 am You know what’s worse than having to trek down to the postal service? Leaving a package outside my backdoor during a rainstorm that’s been going on for several days! No, not a freak, oops, it ended up raining, a serious rain storm! I’d rather travel a few miles to get my stuff from the postal service instead of having it ruined and get a “you don’t have insurance” excuse, which Amazon does not offer. [Reply] Jesse says: November 28, 2014 at 9:15 am I loved amazon, but now it seems like every order comes from USPS. I have never not had a bad experience with USPS. Unless they stop sending it with them and go back to the old way I will not continue my subscription and just get off my lazy butt and go pick the stuff up at the stores. [Reply] Jan says: November 28, 2014 at 9:21 am I haven’t had much trouble with Amazon, I get my kindle e books from them. Never a problem. Once in a while I order a regular book for my brother who is in prison and they follow through. I never had a problem with returns. They always give me credit back to my credit card and a return label. So Amazon is like everyone else: some like them, some don’t. [Reply] chad says: November 28, 2014 at 10:35 am I work for UPS and the USPS Amazon packages are parcel post and are too small for a driver to deliver it. Many times we deliver to a post office, a huge bag of letters and “smells” this is a way to help the post office out with business, and it helps UPS to focus on priority mail, ex. Next day air, Savers, two days, and just regular ground. When you have an organ on ice that is being shipped to a local hospital…..and you have the latest Nicholas Sparks book for a resident… It is easier to forget the book and give it to the mail service so you can focus on the priority. Hopefully this helps some of you understand this more. [Reply] Dustin Thomas says: November 28, 2014 at 3:48 pm I like the move to more USPS. I get my packages on Saturday or Sunday now when I’m actually home. My block has parcel lockers for when I’m not. UPS just “hides” them under the mat. Let’s be honest. USPS is cheaper anyway. They are lowering prices while UPS and FedEx are raising them. [Reply] Tiffany says: November 28, 2014 at 4:41 pm I think your article is very bias and left out much relevant information. I am an avid Prime user and I have many relatives that work for the USPS. You did not address the fact that you could actually schedule a redelivery online and make a request for the carrier to leave the package at your front step. You also left out that if you have to go to the USPS office for the package, they have a separate line (which is never long) for just picking up packages. Here’s another piece of info your “journalistic” writing failed to disclose: one of the reasons why Amazon did not extend their UPS contract is because they did not meet the 100% tracking protocol, while surprisingly, USPS did. Your article is full of misleading information. I wonder what your intentions were in writing this article? Maybe you want to SABOTAGE Amazon? Sorry, that’s pretty much impossible but your article is high up in SEO when I did a search for the USPS. Guess that was your strategy? [Reply] Quasi reporte^^ says: November 29, 2014 at 12:30 am What a misleading piece of ‘journalism’. Parcels are left at homes, notified via email of delivery time, and not brought back to a ‘dead letter’ office. Sheeeesh, do a little reseach into reality before relying on myths and/ or propagand. You got paid to do this? Sad. [Reply] Kelley says: November 29, 2014 at 12:38 am I’m preferring USPS these days because with UPS it ties me down waiting for the package whereas with the post office, the package goes in the mailbox and I can pick it up at my convenience. Also USPS packages move on the weekends while they stay put with UPS, which means sometimes the package arrives more quickly. To be fair, sometimes with the post office the pack comes more slowly. [Reply] Wendy says: November 29, 2014 at 12:53 pm I remember a few years ago the UPS strike had a lot of eBay sellers unexpectedly forced to use USPS. Quite a few stayed with USPS, finding UPS wasn’t the bargain they thought it was. As to the headache of standing in line for a package, that depends a lot on the LPO and the individual carrier. I’ve had carriers leave fairly large packages on a sopping wet driveway and fairly small packages held at the LPO. But I’ve rarely had to deal with long lines there. [Reply] Mike says: November 29, 2014 at 10:22 pm Floyd, take a 2nd think! You are obviously anti-USPS! I could tell you stories about white & brown! ALL carriers: brown, white, and red-white-blue, have their problems! And, exactly, where do you go to pick up that package that requires a signature from white or brown? Your U.S. Post Office is right there in your community and open. Have a problem with USPS? Call them and let them know. It is USPS policy to deliver those Amazon packages, and on Sundays in many communities. The USPS recognizes packages are their future. They are not perfect, but still provide a great service to us. [Reply] James Whitmore says: November 30, 2014 at 3:30 pm I am a rural mail carrier for the USPS who leaves parcels at doorsteps when they don’t fit in the mailbox – in addition, the recipient doesn’t have to be at home for me to leave the parcel at their doorstep – unless a signature is required. Other rural mail carriers at the post office where I work (Appleton, Wisconsin) follow the same procedure – we try to minimize trips to the post office whenever possible. I am sorry for your poor service and suggest that you contact your local postmaster, who hopefully will correct the problem. [Reply] Jerry says: November 30, 2014 at 6:32 pm First off, the USPS is the most economical way to ship packages. Second, the USPS services every home 6 days a week and is required by the postal regulatory committee. Third, the post office is actually is in the black 6 billion dollars because of its increase in parcel delivery. Forth, the post office provides free insurance and free tracking of your parcels which was a service that we charged for in the past. Maybe you outta get your facts straight before you bash the largest and oldest employer in the U.S.!!!! [Reply] Chris says: November 30, 2014 at 8:58 pm Every time that I have ordered from Amazon in the most recent past, it has been left at my doorstep by USPS. Packages have also arrived on-time or a day early. No issues in Chicago with needing to be picked up. [Reply] EMW Reply: January 19th, 2015 at 6:23 pm I feel the same. I have received all my packages on time with USPS. With UPS, I have to wait for one attempt for delivery, then let UPS know I want them to hold it, then travel to the UPS center across the river at limited times for pickup. I don’t dislike UPS or FedEx but I much rather USPS because it is more convenient. [Reply] Patricia Lynn says: November 30, 2014 at 10:46 pm I have the exact opposite opinion of this writer. My main concern is security. I DON’T want packages just left at the door, and that’s what UPS does. They either knock and immediately leave, or sometimes don’t even knock. I MUCH prefer having packages delivered to the apartment’s secure postal boxes, or having them delivered to my door by the USPS or any company OTHER THAN UPS, because none of them have ever just left a package outside my door where it might easily be stolen. I wish we were always allowed a choice of delivery method, because I would never choose UPS. [Reply] Pete says: December 2, 2014 at 1:31 am I usually get the packages delivered to my office address and I bring them home. That has been quite convenient for me. Pete [Reply] Denny says: December 4, 2014 at 10:17 pm I completely agreed. Just had 154 dollars refunded because the post office marked the items as delivered and I never got them. I decided not to purchase the items again and hit the stores. They are not only going to lose money but also customers. [Reply] Luke says: December 5, 2014 at 10:52 pm I agree with this article entirely. Amazon used to ship only small low cost items by Surepost and Smartpost.

Those who actually frequent real news sources, you know those that actually post sources or links to major announcements such as what you are claiming will know that Amazon is not carrier exclusive. During times of high volume such as Black Friday and Christmas Amazon will expand use of carriers they don’t typically utilize, such as the USPS. Another bonus is if you are a Prime customer and they are late delivering the package you can contact customer service (phone, live chat, and email work) and they will extend your Prime membership by a month or you may get a $10-15 credit to use. If you are not a prime member they will typically refund your shipping costs if it is late and shipped by Amazon. [Reply] Metatrox says: December 8, 2014 at 11:58 am I’m sooo disappointed with USPS. I signed up for prime primarily for the free 2 day shipping. USPS is not guaranteed! Thats not what I pay for! I cant count on them at all.

[Reply] Gallie says: December 9, 2014 at 3:26 pm Local USPS has a new contract w/Amazon to “leave if no response.” Several folks in my bldg have had their items stolen, just left on a doorstep on a weekend instead of a pick up at post office notice. [Reply] Joe Reply: December 18th, 2014 at 8:47 pm If you get a USPS account you can give delivery instructions on the tracking number page (eg authorize to leave with neighbor or custodian, put a hold on it etc.).

Customer service is great; if they make a mistake they usually give a gift card credit. Exchanges and returns are simple, just print the return label and drop off at a UPS Store. My packages arrive mostly by UPS still with an occasional FedEx. Since Prime is free two day shipping, if they don’t get it out of the warehouse in time, they overnight it FedEx at no extra charge to ensure I get it on the date promised.

I have delivered thousands of Amazon parcels, it’s a fantastic cooperation between UPS and USPS. They fly them to us and process them down to individual offices then drop them off for us to take out, which eliminates the outdated excuse that USPS ruins every parcel. Most of their parcels won’t fit in a standard mailbox, but that does not mean we take them back to the office. We get out and take them to wherever the customer asks to have their parcels placed, typically the door. I have yet to encounter a package from Amazon requiring a signature, but there really would be no difference between USPS and UPS in regards of a signature, if they aren’t there they get a notification which they can sign and put in their mailbox for re-delivery (something ups can’t do, since they can’t use our mailboxes) or go pick it up at the nearest location and, for rural customers especially, their post office is always closer than a ups facility. [Reply] Brian Reply: January 25th, 2015 at 1:32 am I also have delivered thousands of amazon packages to the door. And we deliver every package the day we get them. Even when UPS brings them late.

[Reply] Bill says: December 12, 2014 at 11:02 pm This article is clearly biased against USPS.. Maybe this guy has a lot of UPS stock? I am also a long time and frequent Amazon customer, and the recent change has actually improved my delivery. My UPS depot is on the other side of town, but I can walk to my post office. Also I have yet to have USPS not leave an Amazon package, but I have fought with UPS for years about why they won’t leave a package,. the surly attitude of their drivers, and the way they often smash packages. As much as I wish that Amazon would ditch UPS, I received Amazon packages in the last couple of days from UPS. I also get Fedex and Lasership delivery from Amazon, and have had only minor problems with all of them except UPS. [Reply] Gordon Reply: December 26th, 2014 at 11:27 am I haven’t ordered from Amazon since they switched to USPS but I don’t think they have gained anything. I have had packages delivered by UPS that it took a month to get them after UPS said it was delivered. It finally appeared out by the mailbox. In the mean time I let the vendor know and they sent me a replacement two times. I received 3 of the item before the first order was delivered. I never knew who had the first order. USPS puts the mail in the wrong mailbox until they are driving me crazy. A few days ago they delivered the neighbors mail to our mailbox. They have delivered our mail to neighbors a number of times. Once a check was delivered to a neighbor. It took a week for it to get to us. It had been opened and stapled through the check and the envelope to keep it in. Another time some medicine was delivered to one of the neighbors. Again it was opened before they gave it to us. I think the people delivering and the neighbors need to learn to read and stop opening our mail. [Reply] Michele says: December 13, 2014 at 10:26 pm Fact: Since Amazon signed the contract with the USPS, four (count them, four!) Amazon packages delivered to our Post Office box were immediately and without notification to us *returned* to Amazon as “undeliverable.” We have been Amazon Prime members since 2001. Amazon Customer Service was mortified. We have spoken numerous times to our post office staff, begging them not to do this, to simply do what they would do with any other package we receive (ie, put a notice in our box and we then pick it up). Each time they vacantly nod their head and say they will. Each time our Amazon (and ONLY Amazon) packages are returned without notice to us. And this time – the final straw – was all of the grandchildren’s Christmas presents. Amazon is trying to make up for the incompetence of the USPS by now noting on our account to ONLY deliver via FED EX or UPS to our doorstep. This contract needs to go. I’ve never seen a more worthless group of people. If this is a common occurrence, Amazon will drop them like a hot potato and the USPS will be a thing of the past. [Reply] Marc says: December 15, 2014 at 6:09 pm I’ve got the same problem that Gallie noticed – the reverse of everyone else here. The latest way Amazon is trying to thwart the problem of missed deliveries is to release the carrier from liability for items left on doorsteps. I live in the city in Baltimore, and have had numerous packages, including a $700 camera, stolen in the last couple of months. Unless you, or a worthy neighbor, see a package being left outside your house, it will be stolen in what I would guess to be a matter of seconds. Thieves just follow the mail carrier through town and their Christmas shopping is complete. Idiotic policy. Adding insult to injury, our lazy local mail carrier in Baltimore has since applied the Amazon philosophy to ALL packages being delivered. [Reply] Don Reply: January 3rd, 2015 at 10:46 am Yes, that is my experience in Baltimore too. Have discontinued using Amazon Prime because of its use of the USPS in the Baltimore area. Don’t like my packages being stolen from my front steps, but marked as delivered on the web site. [Reply] samiup says: December 16, 2014 at 5:05 pm I have noticed a difference. and it is a significant one. USPS delivered my package at 3pm,-when i was at work- the notice they left did not say much, no re-delivery attempt… i went to their website in order to ask for re-delivery, USPS web site was not working as i could not pick up a date from the calendar tool after filling up a long form… Then i said, OK maybe ill just pick it up, their office closes at 4:00 pm… WOW! now what should i do now? take a half day off from work to go to USPS everything i order from Amazon? pretty pathetic. Called Amazon, asked for replacement. the item that was “delivered” will leave USPS and go back to Amazon in 15 days… [Reply] I Do Not Like USPS! says: December 20, 2014 at 2:33 pm Another argument against USPS that no one, it seems, noticed: USPS does its delivery run once a day. So, if package has arrived to your local USPS facility at, say, 12PM, but your postman starts delivery route to your street at 11:59AM, you’re out of luck – you will have to wait extra day for your package. UPS will run delivery routes several times a day, as long as there are packages to be delivered. [Reply] larry Reply: February 23rd, 2015 at 5:59 pm Maybe you have noticed that USPS delivers to every house on the route…not just parcels like ups, fedex. If we didnt…maybe we could make double runs. Also your carrier sorts and cases every piece of mail on his route as well as loading his vehicle. [Reply] Paul says: December 22, 2014 at 7:55 pm I have the same problem but I don’t blame UPS or USPS. If I have a guaranteed delivery date for the 24th and I’m told UPS will have it delivered then. I then find out it’s not to me but my post office and I won’t receive several items until the 26th. I called UPS and they said that’s how it is . Guarantee date by them but not USPS. This is all back on Amazon on how they ship now. I didn’t know this and I have been buying part of my Christmas items from them for awhile. [Reply] Gordon says: December 26, 2014 at 11:47 am I haven’t ordered from Amazon since they switched to USPS but I don’t think they have gained anything. I have had packages delivered by UPS that it took a month to get them after UPS said it was delivered. It finally appeared out by the mailbox. In the mean time I let the vendor know and they sent me a replacement two times. I received 2 of the item before the first order was delivered. I never knew who had the first order. USPS puts the mail in the wrong mailbox until they are driving me crazy. A few days ago they delivered the neighbors mail to our mailbox. They have delivered our mail to neighbors a number of times. Once a check was delivered to a neighbor. It took a week for it to get to us. It had been opened and stapled through the check and the envelope to keep it in. Another time some medicine was delivered to one of the neighbors. Again it was opened before they gave it to us. I think the people delivering and the neighbors need to learn to read and stop opening our mail. [Reply] CaptTurbo says: December 26, 2014 at 5:30 pm I don’t have an issue with Amazon’s shipping but they lost a lot of business from me when they started charging sales tax. [Reply] Richard says: December 26, 2014 at 8:31 pm Thank you, Mr. Brown, for bringing up this subject. And for those that are getting front door delivery of your mail and parcels from the USPS, I am happy for you. We moved into a neighborhood with new housing during the early part of this summer where front door delivery by the USPS is not available, by design. Instead, mail and parcels are delivered to a mailbox/parcel container clusters located at selected street intersections. I suppose it saves time and money for the USPS to do it this way. If there are no parcel containers vacant or if the package is over sized for the container, the USPS wont leave it, but will leave a notice in the mailbox to have it picked up. We tried several times to have them redeliver packages, but the problem of parcel container vacancies or package size also determine whether the attempt to redeliver is successful or not. When Amazon was shipping by UPS or FedEx, we would always get our packages delivered to the house, always. Now, we get about 30% of our packages if shipped via USPS. We’ve been Prime Members since 2004, and since October, we have substantially cut down our ordering from Amazon because of their heavy use of the USPS as shipper of 90% of our orders. Amazon should give shoppers the option of which carrier to use in order to work around obstacles like mail box clusters. [Reply] Tasha Miles says: December 28, 2014 at 1:22 am Amen to this author!! I too have been one of Amazon’s Number One Fans since early years. I also order all our small business supplies from them to the tune of 30K+ Per year. USPS is a disaster for me because we live on a rural route and we never get packages delivered to the door. This results in a trip to the post office which is 15 miles away and not well run. I can’t find a solution through Amazon. I’m willing to pay more and /or wait longer for my packages JUST DON’T USE USPS! .. but there is no way to opt out. Why a “can do” company like Amazon pairs up with a “can’t do and don’t want to try to do” government agency like the USPS is beyond my understanding. The results were predictable without having an MBA. [Reply] Calvin says: January 9, 2015 at 3:07 pm My problem isn’t so much that they are using the postal service (live an an area where we have the combined mailboxes), it is that they have increased the cost of Prime and are using a cheaper service altogether (USPS). For me it seems like they are trying to boost revenue and at the same time decrease costs. My Prime membership is about to end this January and I do not plan on renewing. $20 price increase for cheaper USPS package deliveries… no thank you. I can wait a few extra days with all the non-primies.

After my amazon prime membership ends this year I am done with Amazon. Also size of package is not the issue. I have ordered……. 1 Sony PS4 bundle with 3 games. It came in a large box via US Mail… [Reply] Chris H Reply: February 14th, 2015 at 9:00 pm I too have had way too many issues with USPS in our area.

[Reply] Nick says: January 16, 2015 at 6:58 pm I’m not sure where the author lives, but at my house the USPS carrier places letters in the mailbox at the end of my driveway and packages on my front porch. Granted, I live in the suburbs and not a gigantic apartment building, but still the article is very misleading. The only time I’ve had to go to the post office to pick up a package is when a signature is required and I wasn’t home when USPS attempted to deliver. UPS and USPS are both really good about taking a note with my signature on it and leaving a signature required package as well. FedEx on the other hand is awful. They actually refuse to deliver a package early. Let me explain: say a seller uses ups ground to ship a parcel, that service has a 5 day guarantee. Many times it gets to the customer in 2-3 days, everyone is happy in this instance. Well, very recently I had that very thing happen with fedex, except those crooks actually held my package at a processing center for THREE DAYS before finally delivering it. I saw this on the tracking system with the message “package not scheduled for delivery today”, so I called their customer service department and my god were they awful. They could not have cared less, seriously. I even said that USPS and ups would never do something like this. Her response “well that’s our policy”, justifying NOT delivering it “early” and holding it to deliver on the 5th day. Fedex is also not good at all for working around “signature required” restrictions. I once left a note saying it was ok to leave the package at the door and provided my signature and telephone number, only to come home to a snippy “we missed you” flyer with “must get sig in person” written in pen on it. That fedex “smartpost” someone else mentioned (where fedex does the work from origin to destination city, then hands off to USPS for delivery) is another awful set up. That can often end up being a 8 day service in my experience. Needless to say I’d rather drive to pick up my purchase from the origin than be forced to use fedex again! [Reply] EMW says: January 19, 2015 at 5:56 pm This article is incorrect. The USPS has left several packages at my door. I have not had to go to the USPS to get a package.

I live in Columbia SC where there is a warehouse. Some of my packages, now that the USPS is involved, leave the Columbia warehouse, are shipped to Concord and then back to Columbia to me. What sense does that make? USPS is the worse and I for one, hope they become obsolete altogether. [Reply] Tricia says: February 6, 2015 at 7:04 am I have my Amazon packages delivered to my employer’s street address because UPS cannot get into my building at home. Unfortunately for me, my employer also has a P.O. box so now that USPS is being used, instead of delivering to the street address they mark all my packages as delivered and put them in the P.O. box room and isn’t physically delivered to me until the third day. Therefore, I pay the Prime fee but don’t get the 2 day shipping as promised. [Reply] TC says: February 16, 2015 at 7:06 am USPS is far better than UPS. However Amazon tricks you into thinking you are paying $100 for prime getting free 2 day shipping, while the truth is that Amazon is actually only shipping it normal mail or slower. They get away with it because they have so many warehouses everywhere. But it is false advertising.

[Reply] LW says: February 18, 2015 at 8:49 pm USPS is certainly NOT better than UPS for me. The postal service will not deliver to my door since I live inside a gated community and the USPS’s carrier union contract doesn’t require them to deliver inside the gate, so any parcel that won’t fit inside the small parcel boxes must be picked up from the post office — a 45 minute round trip. Super frustrating! I’ve started breaking up my orders into 1 thing at a time — sometimes one in the morning and one in the evening — to try to keep boxes as small as possible with hopes they’ll fit inside the parcel locker. Plus, I figure it costs Amazon a heck of a lot more by making them ship each item individually, so maybe they’ll reconsider allowing their customers to select their own carriers.

I just had to go to Post Office to file a complaint about 4 packages that say delivered but weren’t. Well guess what they found all 4 in carriers truck in a bag with many other packages from up to a week ago that weren’t delivered.

[Reply] larry Reply: February 23rd, 2015 at 5:45 pm Packages left in vehicle would be found the next day. I believe you made this up. Also postal management will scan parcels left in office as attempted because the clerks missthrow them and the carriers are instructed to leave them in a tub or on floor by supervisors desk before they leave. These packages may not be delivered until the next day. Try not to blame everything on your carrier especially if you don’t take the time to get to no them as your carrier. [Reply] Ace21 says: February 27, 2015 at 1:58 pm I am fed up with Amazon because of this. What used to take a few days to deliver a package now takes 1-2 WEEKS. Reason being is my UPS location is in a city 30 miles away. Yesterday, a package arrived at UPS, great, should be out for delivery that day. NOPE. Already gone through this once, I immediately contacted UPS so I could drive over and pick up the package. I was told NO, they are required to turn the package over to the Post Office in the city, which then sits on the package for a few more days ‘sorting it’ to be shipped to the Post Office in the city I live in. Once that finally happens, my local post office then sits on it for another day or 2 ‘sorting’ it, all the while the Post Office is telling Amazon the package has been delivered. EVERY SINGLE PACKAGE I have ordered that came USPS has stated ‘delivered’ when checked online at least 1-2 days BEFORE the package is actually delivered. Today, I just looked, and the post office is stating package is delivered, yet, it is still sitting in a post office in a different city from which I live in. No more Amazon for me if this is the service I can come to expect. I will pay a few more dollars to buy items as local as possible and if they have to be shipped, USPS will NEVER be an option for me as they are the absolute worst shippers I have ever experienced (of course that will vary city to city, but mine is terrible). [Reply] Tom says: February 28, 2015 at 1:32 pm My problem is that for large packages, my local USPS has been claiming “delivery attempted” even though I’m certain this did not happen. Twice in three weeks (original and replacement order) for a large (28 lb bag of dog food) package this has occurred. I was at home both times and there’s no way I (or my dog) missed any doorbell, nor were there any notices. I requested redelivery and the package goes into la la land both times (“delivery status not updated”). IMO this is Amazon’s responsibility. I have to go to the post office to pick it up, I might as well just go to the store. For example, I work for an IT company that provides web hosting services but we outsource to other data centers for the physical hosting. I can’t tell my customers “oh, your site is down, please call the data center”. I take responsibility for the vendors I choose, and Amazon must as well. [Reply] Kyle says: March 4, 2015 at 12:07 pm The business decision Amazon made is one of simple economics (short-sighted, but simple). Of the three major players (UPS, FedEx, and USPS), only one has no shareholders to answer to so that’s the only one willing to lose money on every delivery. Experience with all of these carriers depends, primarily, on the individual people involved (the driver for your route / your mail carrier). If you have a good one (I used to), then you might not even notice that Amazon made that decision. If you have a bad one (I do now), you’ll consider Amazon’s decision to be a bad one. The other difference in the carriers is that you have no recourse with USPS. My USPS carrier frequently scans the package as delivered even though he never even drives down my street (e.g., snow on the ground and no tracks whatsoever). Frequent trips to the PO have only created discord, not solutions. Sometimes my USPS carrier ends up delivering the package in another day or two, sometimes I never get it. Taking it up with the merchant is of no use because the tracking information shows it’s been delivered so I appear to be the liar. I continue to look for online merchants that ship via UPS or FedEx (without handing off to USPS). It’s becoming more and more difficult to find these because – as I stated originally, no one can delivery cheaper than the one who’s willing to lose money on every delivery. [Reply] Nevada says: March 8, 2015 at 12:31 pm Living in rural Nevada, I find USPS services to be the best option for me. USPS does not deliver to my house due to my choice in location, so I head to the Post Office daily. Using a PO Box means I know when I will get my mail and if I have a package a key is left in my box. That key is numbered and used to open a larger package box in the same area. I don’t want things left at the front door of my house. I want them inside dry and safe. Maybe instead of expecting free services from USPS people should purchase the use of a PO Box? There are no lines to pick up mail and it can be convenient. I’ve had really bad experiences with home delivery which included packages being left at the wrong house with Fedex and UPS and Ontrac (being the worst!). However, out of all three UPS is much better in following up with mistakes, but to pick up a package at their shipping department means a 45 min drive (one way) for me! I dislike ordering from companies that use anything but USPS and from my perspective, Amazon made the right choice. [Reply] will says: March 10, 2015 at 10:52 pm USPS leaves packages on the street here. They are too lazy to bring it to the front door. So we’ve had lots of packages disappear.

I threw the pink slip away and waited for it to be returned to Amazon and instead got another gift at the store. The post office is open 9-5 (I’m at work 8-5, an hour away) and then open saturdays 9-1, which meant I either use my sleep-in day to get there early, or suffer the wrath of a dreadfully long and painful wait at the Brooklyn USPS office.

Troy says: March 25, 2015 at 6:15 pm I literally got off the phone with the USPS about this situation. I live in an apartment complex in a small town in the country. I ordered something from Amazon on Monday, with free 2-day Prime shipping. I was home sick today from work – perfect, I’ll be here to receive the package. About an hour ago (3PM), the tracking said “attempted delivery by USPS, notice left” at 9:30AM. What? I was here – no one attempted delivery. Plus, the notice that was left in my mailbox (not until 3:30PM) had the back crossed out – they won’t deliver even if I gave them permission to! Now, I have to wait until Saturday to get to the post office (they are open from 9AM – 5PM Monday – Friday…hmmm, right during my work hours too). To me, that’s laziness on the part of the carrier. Not the first time this has happened, and if I would have known they were using USPS to deliver, I would have spent the extra money and bought it at the store. [Reply] Al Day says: March 26, 2015 at 6:15 pm My experience is just the opposite. USPS delivers to my door while UPS will not deliver at all to my location. Packages delivered by the postal service are usually in better condition than those delivered by UPS when they used to deliver here. So I don’t agree with the synopsis of issues in this article. Amazon now has all their UPS shipments to me going back which tends to piss them off. In time they will just give us a choice or lose our business. All vendors should offer choice so whoever is best where you are can deliver for you. It should never be the vendors choice. I’m willing to pay extra to have FedEx or USPS deliver all my stuff. No more UPS for me. [Reply] Kyle says: April 3, 2015 at 7:46 pm I’ve made over 70 orders from Amazon in the past 6 months, them switching to USPS is a dream come true. I don’t live in an apartment any more, but generally only USPS carriers can easily get into most apartments, which is an enormous plus right there. UPS drivers will often just leave notices without even ringing the bell if it’s not safe for them to throw your packages all the way from the curb to your door. Tampering with legitimate mail is a serious offense, but petty theft if UPS/FedEx; consider the implications for packages that are obviously from Amazon. Finally, I feel like people complain about post offices like they do the DMV – have you ever actually been to one? Mine is huge and beautiful, and there’s rarely much of a line. I know not all of these things will apply to everyone but there’s not much to complain about with regards to the USPS unless you’re a crazy libertarian or something. [Reply] Larry says: April 4, 2015 at 12:16 am I’ve noticed this trend lately myself. I live in an apartment building in NYC and am not always home, but UPS would usually be kind enough to leave my Amazon packages with my neighbors, or at the least attempt re-delivery. USPS? Pink slip for pickup the very first day, without so much as a buzz through the intercom. I’ve missed several packages when I was actually at home because the delivery person wouldn’t take the time to notify me. Then I usually have to wait until the weekend to pick them up, only to be forced to wait in line for 45 minutes. On top of it all the employees at the local post office are rude and sarcastic, and actually raise their voices at the customers. I’ve already started shopping locally to avoid the dreadful post office, or I order items from Amazon that I know will fit inside my mail box (which they don’t always leave in there anyway). And the Amazon Dash button, you’ve got to be kidding me, who in their right mind would wait 45 minutes in line to pick up paper towels when they could spend 5 min for $1 more, or sometimes even pay less? Sure those dollars add up, but so do the 45 min. Would you rather have spent 5 hours and 40 minutes picking up paper towels over the course of a year, or $12?

I order lots of business supplies, books, and clothes through Amazon, and stuff that usually goes to a Locker now must come to either my home address or my P.O. box. Fortunately, I already have a P.O. box in my city and I go once a week on Saturday mornings (if I’m in town) when the lines aren’t that long. We have a separate line in my P.O. branch for picking up packages ONLY. Doesn’t mean it’s not a long line, but it’s separate from regular window services. I don’t want to see the USPS go under. It’s an institution that should be allowed to run and I’m 100% against privatization contracts that the capitalists like Obama are proposing and now sticking us with, such as they just signed with Staples. Staples employees are not fit to run a Post Office. But then I’m a communist. Never underestimate the hypocrisy of capitalists, though. They’d sell their own mothers for a quarter.

I cancelled my prime membership and don’t use them anymore since they switched to USPS final leg delivery. USPS is a joke. They don’t deliver packages to my house because it has a long driveway. I’ve met USPS at the street and they hand me a ‘We attempted to deliver your package” notice. To top it off, the notice always says I can pick it up the next day at the post office, but 80% of the time they don’t have it ready so I usually have to wait 2 days after the ‘guaranteed’ delivery date. Also, this is a way for FedEx and UPS to offload costs onto taxpayers. As is usual with corporate-government corruption, profits go up, service goes down. Screw all these hucksters. [Reply] Terie says: April 13, 2015 at 1:36 pm For those of you complaining – I complained too. But, I took my complaints to Amazon and they put in my account to NEVER transfer any of my packages to the post office.

I now have to give that information to all of the companies that are doing this. I hate seeing that my package will be delivered a certain day and then discover it won’t be for another day because it was sent to USPS. Then it takes at least another 2 -3 days. Unacceptable. That is why USPS gets no business! [Reply] Sean says: April 17, 2015 at 5:12 am I would like to say that yes, the postal service has terrible customer service in my city. I worked as a carrier for all of one month after graduation from University, and the structure and idiocy of my local post office made it impossible for any educated or markedly skilled employees to remain there for any amount of time and keep their sanity. My “manager” called me every 10 minutes on my cell phone while I was out making amazon deliveries, causing me to be slower than needed to make these deliveries (yes, to the front porch.) The carriers that I was hired along with tried hard to get the mail delivered on time and correctly, but the constant berating from management to “go faster!!!” resulted in most people either cutting corners or quitting after a couple weeks. The system in place is setup for the idiots to eventually take charge, while the hard workers end up finding more lucrative work elsewhere. This all shows in the service that customers receive from their post office nowadays. I bet most of the people who are now having problems with their mail had no problems 10 years ago, and this is a result of the current system of allowing the inmates to run the asylum. The post office is a case study in what not to do as a company, how not to treat your employees, and how not to treat your customers. It is lunacy and idiocy at its finest and I don’t expect to see it around 10 years from now if they don’t make some serious changes in management. Amazon is backing the wrong horse in the name of profit, but they are only hurting themselves in the long run. The Post office is not capable of keeping it’s promises to Amazon.

[Reply] Shay says: April 17, 2015 at 3:02 pm Well, I have been ordering from Amazon lately as my company as a reward program and I get gift cards for free for Amazon. Everytime I have order, UPS delivers my packages and they have always been early. They will just leave them on my doorstep, or sometimes they will deliver in the evenings when I am home, so I accept them in person. My local UPS driver is polite, friendly, and is always on time. I have received packages via USPS before, and I have to leave a note on the mail box to give them permission to leave my bigger packages on my porch. I don’t know if this is the case for any of you, but I’m not sure if they are allowed to leave packages without permission. I have ran into this before and now always leave a note when I am expecting something via USPS so that the post person knows what I want.

[Reply] marie says: April 28, 2015 at 11:22 am I had the same problems always having to wait a day or so to get my package.Then i would have to go online and fill out a re-deliver form.That always takes another day to get your mail IF you fill out the Re-deliver online form before the cut off time for that day.I talked to my post man about this always happening and this is what he informed me to do… Next time you see your post man driving his vehicle- Grab some of the re-deliver orange slips.Sign the orange slip and state where you want your package delivered(porch,side of house ect.) Put the orange slip in your mail box a few days before you expect your package to arrive and put up the flag.This way you will never get a re-delivery slip and your package will be EXACTLY WHERE you want it and on the correct delivery date. I hope this helps… [Reply] Hari says: April 29, 2015 at 10:11 am There are always some caveats to a deal. I have been using Amazon for almost a couple of years now and all of a sudden I saw them delivering on Sundays, which took me by surprise. There are a couple of times when I thought it would be delivered to my door step but it ended up in my mail box but I have made it a part of my routine to check my mail box. My experience has been a little different, as they still left the bigger boxes outside my door step. Atleast the good part is that Amazon has joined hands with a sinking business and hope this helps USPS employees from losing their jobs. [Reply] miguel says: May 3, 2015 at 9:26 am USPS has time and time again missed my 2day delivery dead line. The tracking always says its out for delivery but never arrives that day. Then they update the tracking saying I wasn’t home but they never left the sticky note on my door which means they never even attempted. Then the post office holds my package for a day and attempts to redeliver the following day. So 2 day delivery turns into 4 day. This is the gunhill road post office in the Bronx. The employees there don’t care about their job and delivering on time. I run a business and use amazon prime as a means of getting my supplies. But without reliable delivery times I’m starting to question if i should find alternative means. When my packages get shipped via FedEx or UPS I never have an issue. But more and more they are using USPS. Bad move amazon. There’s a reason why nobody uses them. Shouldn’t your partnerships be strong ones? This is a step backwards and a bad business move. [Reply] phototristan says: May 6, 2015 at 1:28 am USPS consistently forgets to deliver Amazon packages and never even leaves a notice. I have to manually try tracking it to find out that is at the post office and I have to then go pick it up. Most of the time, the driver just doesn’t feel like delivering the box and it sits in the truck. So many times, I’ve been home only to not receive the package and track it online later only to find out they say ‘attempted delivery, notice left’ to cover their own butt. In reality, they did not attempt any delivery nor did they even leave a notice for me. I’ve also try their online redelivery service with shoddy results. Sometimes, they don’t even redeliver. Last Christmas, they even lost a package from Amazon. USPS has completely flakey service, terrible customer service and no follow through for the actual delivering of shipments! I recommend everyone reading complain to Amazon about USPS’s terrible service. This is the only way they can begin to realize how bad USPS is. [Reply] R says: May 7, 2015 at 5:42 am Amazon has betrayed one of their core customer bases with this move. Amazon has been a lifeline for those of us in rural areas, but the Postal Service leaves packages OUT ON TOP OF OUR RURAL MAIL BOX, and a few times, on the ground in torrents of rain, so most of the time, it’s either destroyed or stolen. So after all these years of depending on their wonderful service, we have no choice but to stop using them entirely. Shame on Amazon for not giving a rat’s rear about this. [Reply] Shannon says: May 29, 2015 at 3:48 pm I have Amazon Prime and LOVE it. USPS used to deliver my Prime Pantry, but it’s gone back to UPS and FedEx. Frankly, USPS did a better job, my LaCroix mineral water cans exploded with each delivery on UPS, none with USPS. Our mailman always brought those big heavy boxes to my front door and rang the bell, and would often wait to see me open the door from the curb to wave as he left. I now get deliveries on Sundays as well. No more trips to Walmart or Target for dry and household goods, pet food and MORE! [Reply] Judy says: June 1, 2015 at 10:35 am So I ordered something on Thursday, and the package was to be delivered on Friday (overnight delivery). My package was scanned to Brooklyn, NY 11214 where I leave on Friday morning, and then was sent to NY, NY 10014, then NY, NY 10199 and than to Brooklyn, NY 11256 (this all happened between Friday and Sunday), finally this morning my package was scanned at Brooklyn, NY 11214 my area code and I am still waiting for delivery. I wasted a beautiful Saturday stuck at home waiting for this package which was already late, because of course it could not possibly show up more than 24 hrs late (wrong). The last ten packages which I had delivered to work where handed off to my mail room a full 24 hours after the package was marked delivered. I will not be renewing my prime membership if they do not move back to using UPS. Amazon was great and refunded my shipment. Gave me a $5 credit toward a future purchase, and then extended my membership by one month. Highly disappointed in their decision to make a deal with USPS because they are notorious for not delivering mail timely if at all. Disgusted with the way my package was handled. [Reply] Kimberly Neal says: June 5, 2015 at 12:51 am This is an odd piece for a couple of reasons, however , as a carrier I must correct the author by saying “STOP SPREADING HYSTERIA”! Dead Letter pile if you’re not home?! Nonsense! USPS unlike UPS will decipher if it’s safe to leave your package, where we should leave it, who with, and if we are unable, we will leave a notice. We will not just cram it in to your mailbox. We will not just toss it on the porch leaving it in front of God and everybody… Say do you own stock in UPS?!

I live in a development where my USPS mail comes to a group of mailboxes. If and only if the item won’t fit in the mail box will USPS deliver to my door. Problem is the mailboxes for the development are in a room that locks at 7pm daily and isn’t open on Sunday’s. What this means for me is that I no longer get my Amazon prime items delivered to my door. And if I can’t make it to the mailroom by 7 (I work 12 hr shifts) I won’t get my prime items for days!!. I asked the postal delivery person to please deliver Amazon items to my house. I got a VERY Stern no, that is what the larger mailboxes are in the mail room. Postmaster said the same thing. No we WON’T deliver to your house. When my prime expires, I won’t be renewing. Amazon has lost my business. [Reply] Tim Scott says: June 16, 2015 at 3:39 pm USPS has entirely stopped delivering parcels to my townhouse. Instead, they place “Attempted Delivery” cards at our mail house. BS!

[Reply] bruce says: June 29, 2015 at 8:16 pm I am a Rural Carrier for USPS and UPS and FED_EX leave parcels at the mailbox because they are too lazy to bring them up the steeper driveways. I always bring them up and leave by front door or garage. Maybe instead of calling your carriers idiots or other names offer them a cold water and ask them to leave the parcels by your door. If you get a slip just go online and request redelivery [Reply] John Reply: September 29th, 2015 at 12:39 am Requesting redelivery does nothing. My USPS carrier is refusing to deliver packages he deems too heavy. I know this because of the last package he refused to deliver. I filed a complaint and they fessed up that he said the package was too heavy, but still refused to deliver it. Which is odd, because normal carriers like UPS or FedEx use things like hand carts to move around heavy packages. I also doubt the women at the front desk of the post office are going to move the package around any easier than the postal carrier could. Funny how the front desk staff at the post office have to move the heavy package around, but the actual carrier doesn’t. So on this latest package, Saturday(2 days ago), the carrier lied and claimed there was no secure place to deliver on the delivery slip. Of course I had two USPS packages scheduled for delivery on Saturday. The heavy one was not delivered at around 8am, just the slip was left. The lighter one was delivered around 2 and left on my porch without issue. So much for a lack of a secure location. I filed for redelivery for today and instead of getting my package the status on Amazon updated to “Sorry, your package is delayed because of an issue with the carrier.” Even when the carrier gets called out, they still feel comfortable refusing to deliver packages. Very nice job security, you can’t get fired for refusing to do your job. I know I am never going to see that package from Amazon, it was prime pantry, so maybe Amazon will do something since they want prime pantry to work. Last time they resent the heavy item and laughably it was resent with USPS when Amazon said they would put a note on the order to use a different carrier. But it got delivered on a Sunday and I think they have different people delivering on Sunday, so that time the carrier left it on my porch. With USPS it is simply up to the carrier. Some people have carriers that deliver anything and some people have carriers that refuse to deliver everything. It is hit or miss. I filed a complaint about the fact that the carrier lied by saying there was no secure location, at the very least if the carrier is refusing to deliver because the item is too heavy, they need to put that real reason the delivery slip so Amazon knows it is a carrier issue. It is annoying to have to explain this to Amazon when Amazon’s system is telling them there was no secure location, it makes the customer(me) look bad. USPS should not be lying on these delivery slips. So that is where I am. I can only get light packages from Amazon. If anything is heavy and comes via USPS, there are no guarantees I will get it. My only question is how long will Amazon let me order before they just kick me off despite the fact that they are the ones who chose the carrier? [Reply] Boss Reply: October 8th, 2015 at 9:49 pm Any carrier, regardless of the company they work for should be instantly terminated for refusing to deliver a package. Job description shows up to 70 lbs lifting. If carrier has some sort of disability or restrictions other qualified employee should deliver your package. If your postmaster does not take care of this problem call the Senate. You will see a difference. Shame on anyone out there who works and does not care about customers. You are customer as well and treat people way you want to be treated unless you are real JERK. Sorry but it is what it is! [Reply] jamie says: June 29, 2015 at 9:30 pm I am a letter carrier in a small town. Half of the Amazon packages we deliver are straight off the UPS truck.

Also, in my town we deliver straight to your door, no matter how small or large the package. We deliver 100 percent of the Amazon packages everyday in my town.

It is also one of the most reliable companies in the world. [Reply] Nikki says: July 2, 2015 at 5:53 pm My UPS and Fed Ex deliveries are delivered right to the door always. The Post Office hangs everything in a sack swinging off my rural mailbox out on the road. It is over a city block away from my house and they leave stuff there in a plastic bag in the pouring rain or whatever. I can’t even see it’s there plus anyone driving the road can just stop and steal it. A lot of stuff has gotten wet and been ruined. I’m elderly and am unable to walk or drive to my box and have to wait for relatives to pick stuff up for me. It’s very unkind as I’ve known the mailman all his life. Guess he doesn’t care. [Reply] dave Reply: September 22nd, 2015 at 12:51 am Nikki, you can request your mail and packages be delivered to your door because of health reasons. We have folks who are disabled or aged who we will go right up the driveway and deliver to your house everyday. There is a form to be filled out from your postmaster, but when approved we do what is called a dismount, and bring mail to you so you do not have to go to mailbox. Hopefully this helps! [Reply] Boss Reply: October 8th, 2015 at 9:42 pm Nikki, Rural Letter Carrier should never leave box hanging on the post or your mailbox. If you are less than half mile away from the box package should be delivered to your door unless can fit in the box. If your carrier does not care, consumer affair cares. Also, like Tom said get letter from your doctor and all your mail, (not just packages) will and should be delivered to your door. It is called HARDSHIP and can not be denied. [Reply] Tom says: July 3, 2015 at 10:35 pm I am a letter carrier in Spokane, Washington with 28 years experience. In the last year and a half we have seen a huge increase in Amazon packages, and exactly a year ago we started delivering Amazon on Sunday, using temp carriers. Now that nearly every package has a tracking barcode, it has become painful for us to not give good, on-time service, because if we don’t, the supervisor may hear about it on the phone, then the carrier will hear it, and no one likes to hear customer complaints, especially from the people that we serve and interact with every day. Our scanners now upload instantly, and customers can go to the website and track their packages in real time. One of the strengths of the ol’ post office is the national forwarding system. It is not uncommon for someone who has recently moved, to order a package from Amazon or eBay, for example, and forget to give them their new address, resulting in the package going to the postal unit that delivers to their old address. (I see this happen every month.) It takes a few extra days, and there might be a forwarding charge, but it does usually get forwarded, whereas if UPS or FedEx get such a package, they will deliver it erroneously and then will probably get to go pick it up again (if the new people give it back), and return it. I have nothing against UPS or FedEx. They have their respective strengths as well. UPS rates are much higher than USPS rates for packages under ten pounds. There seems to be a large percentage of the public who don’t notice that when they ship via UPS, UPS takes its profit and then farms the package out to USPS to deliver at the lower rate. From the viewpoint of UPS, this looks like a really good deal. From the viewpoint of customers, it does not look like a good deal, or it should not, anyway. The problem with all delivery companies is that they use people to do the work. Not all people care about the customers they serve. I certainly do, and want to give the best service possible every day to everyone on my route. We just heard an inside word that Amazon is about to terminate using FedEx and UPS for the most part and use mostly USPS. This will cause some problems with people who use P.O. boxes for their mail, and it will be interesting to see how this is solved. [Reply] Stephen Walsh says: July 20, 2015 at 1:03 pm I’ve accepted the fact that I will never receive an Amazon package delivered via USPS on a Sunday. My local post office uses the tactic of saying they delivered it in the system so Amazon thinks it was delivered on Sunday, but the package isn’t placed on my doorstep until the following day. [Reply] Melinda Miller says: August 3, 2015 at 8:19 pm To the hardworking dedicated postal workers who have posted, thank-you for your excellent commitment to service. However, I believe it does matter where you live whether you get good USPS service or not. UPS and FedEx have the same issues. If the Postmaster of the local post office don’t care and follow-up issues and complaints, why should the delivery personnel care? There are lazy people in all businesses. You may think people are crazy with some of their complaints of non-delivery but they really do happen exactly the way they say they do. I ordered something for my daughter and it went “out for delivery” never to be seen again. The next thing I mailed noted out for delivery on a Monday and a tag for postage due showed up in her box on Friday, she works from home. A letter posted to her in her state took 5 business days to arrive. She can go 3 days without any mail and then get a large pile. I, on the other hand have excellent mail service. People make the difference in the service, not the organization. [Reply] Lee says: August 9, 2015 at 10:00 pm Well I just got my first taste of the awesome USPS /Amazon partnership! Three different deliveries show as “delivered” to “front porch/door” on the USPS tracking site, but not one package on my porch and I have been home all day doing work around the house, I would have either heard the door or have seen the packages (in fact I believe I was walking my dog right out front at the time!). USPS service has been poor in my area, lots of mis-delivered mail and they have lost two “priority” packages of mine in the last few year. And as others have noted, they are a unaccountable. It’s bad news for Amazon, the biggest reason of all I have been such a huge customer is the shipping. I like the fact you can see the date something will be delivered and know you can count on it. I’m willing pay extra sometimes for a product just so I can have the ease and confidence of shipping. The author is correct, they made a deal with the devil and have destroyed their core competency by teaming up with worst delivery service on earth. [Reply] Randy K says: August 20, 2015 at 11:01 am The USPS is responsible enough to ensure that your package isn’t stolen, and according to this “article” that’s bad for the customer? If the customer leaves a not for the mailman that says “Please leave all packages at back door” or a similar note, then the package will be left there. This was obviously written by a UPS employee that feels threatened. A strong Post Office is good for the American people. UPS has to make a profit to keep their shareholders happy, they don’t care about the customer only the bottom line. For the Post Office, the customer IS the shareholder so they have an incentive to make the customer happy. Does UPS deliver to every house? NO, they only want the high profit stops. How about the Post Office? YES, it’s called “universal service” and is protected by the US constitution. As far as the false statement about the “Dead Letter Office” that’s total B.S., mail only goes there if it cannot be returned to sender because there is not return address on the package. [Reply] Matt says: September 22, 2015 at 10:44 pm I found this thread because of the huge problems I’ve been having with USPS and Amazon. The packages get in a weird place where they never arrive anywhere, they leave Amazon never to be seen again. Fortunately, Amazon has been good and sent the items next-day FedEx (when I ALWAYS get them!) Can’t be cheap for Amazon! In fact, last time, they even comped the item and sent it next day. I think Amazon is starting to see the light. USPS is having problems. My magazines were always a few days late (weekly magazines). Now they are weeks late. Sometimes multiple weeks of a weekly magazine will show up at the same time. [Reply] Boss says: October 8, 2015 at 9:23 pm With respect to all of you, I have to disagree for some of the issues. In Rural America USPS is still best option to get packages whether from Amazon, Ebay, or anyone else in the world. Billions of packages are being processed trough different distribution USPS facilities. Every package dropped to local Post Offices have to be delivered same day. Also Holiday and Sundays delivery are available. Amazon premium packages are delivered by unmarked vehicles mostly rental and these guys are blowing up stop signs and traffic lights like crazy. Worst and dangerous delivery services ever. When it comes to magazines again is distribution facility. If you have problem with USPS you should not post it here; call consumer affair, Congress or Senate Offices and your problem will be solved 100%. No one likes to have bad feedback but Amazon delivery packages are bad for customers not for USPS. USPS is still most trusted federal agency. All USPS employee went to extended background check. Best wishes and better delivery to all of US. [Reply] schnauzer says: October 27, 2015 at 2:44 pm I have a one for all of you.

So I waited to see if it would arrive late. Today the USPS truck pulls into our driveway, and the driver TELLS ME she delivered it Sunday, to the WRONG address; then she asks me, if I eventually received it ok. While Amazon isn’t the problem here, the USPS is. I went in and cancelled all my future orders with Amazon, and I will buy from whatever website, or local retailer, where I don’t have to deal with USPS.

Pay extra for the delivery and then the next day they show estimated arrival of By 8:00PM. At the same time and on the same page there is no tracking info and they sow it as being in process of shipping. I chat with their rep at 3:00PM and am told the item is on the way and will arrive at 8:00PM (Note: My office closes at 5:00PM) so I wait for the item to arrive. At 8:18 no delivry, no update on the website so I chat with the again and am told it is in the warehouse being prepared for shipment?? I ask when it will arrive and they do not know?? I think Amazon has gotten too big and is forgetting who their customers are and how to treat them. I asked that all of my pending orders be cancelled as I will source my items alsewhere and was told they could only cancel two of five and guess what. The one item I’m waiting for is not one of them??? [Reply] Doug D says: December 4, 2015 at 8:52 pm USPS has made every excuse in the world not to deliver. They lost a printer (obviously it was stolen). They claimed my address did not exist?? When calling the postmaster about the address issue I was told “It was the Amazon Driver” Yes, the special Amazon delivery person that works for the USPS…?

[Reply] Wayne in NC says: December 11, 2015 at 7:12 pm I need to say I have never worked for USPS and neither has any member of my family or any friends. I detested SmartPost and SurePost where UPS or FedEx turned over packages to USPS for delivery because the packages were usually late. Of course, I am an Amazon Prime member and have been since it was introduced. For the last year USPS has delivered almost all of our Amazon packages (there have been over 200). Everyone has been either on time or early. The postal delivery person brings packages to our front door if hey do not fit in our mailbox. They also deliver on Saturday AND Sunday. USPS has been at least as reliable as UPS with our Amazon Prime deliveries. Even large and heavy package are delivered to our front door on time by USPS. I have not been a fan of USPS for many years and I doubt whether the service needs to exist at all. But I must give them credit for their 100% on time delivery of over 200 Amazon Prime packages during the last year. They have also delivered packages from other online store on time 100% of the time.

I lived on a private road and usps does not travel on private roads. We did get one delivery to our door 2 years ago. The postal lady was complaining because she said usps signed a contract with Amazon that 2 day was 2 day, even on a private road. They must have Un-signed it because I thought it would neat to have some bulk items sent to our door 2 weeks later. I got a slip in our kiosk and had to make a 40 mile round trip to pick up my package. Also, if you notice, in rural areas, postal employees have to use their own cars. They use the smallest and most economical so half the time a big package won’t even fit in their car. And to think the post office used to be great! How the mighty have fallen. Nothing to do with Amazon, but let me say this is Saturday and a Christmas package was mailed to us this past Monday, with 2 other packages, from the same address. 2 packages made it and the 3rd, a box with an Xbox one and $100 Amazon card still shows it sitting 2 states away. It was scanned late Monday evening and seems to have disappeared. [Reply] Cliff Claven says: January 2, 2016 at 6:26 pm I’ve read this entire comment thread, largely siding with USPS workers. They, like our public schools and prisons, have to serve everyone, yet they are maligned and derided without thought given as to how difficult a task that is. However, I was promised an Amazon package today, for delivery to my PO Box. It’s Saturday, and the post office closes at 3PM. The package made it there, but according to the lady at the counter, after the cutoff for distribution to PO Boxes. So my goods will sit in a local post office all day Saturday and Sunday. I can go in and pick them up Monday (but not until after 10AM), 48 hours after I was promised them. My order arriving at the post office and my order arriving in my hands are two very different things to me, but apparently not to Amazon.

Amazon has cancelled my (and several family member) account(s) today because I dared to report EVERY package that wasn’t delivered (I have observed a 25% on-time delivery rate with USPS and a 80% ever eventually receive it rate from Amazon). [Reply] Stephen Matrese Reply: January 14th, 2016 at 3:16 pm I, stupidly, hoped that if I kept reporting the problems, Amazon would DO SOMETHING, ANYTHING about it. [Reply] Jill Parkins says: January 18, 2016 at 9:26 am I ordered from Amazon and it was to be delivered by USPS yesterday. I got a text from Amazon saying that delivery was attempted and the receptacle was blocked and the carrier left a notice. I was home and the receptacle was not blocked and there was no notice. My daughter was watching out the window for a friend at the time they claim to have attempted delivery. They never came. Now today tracking states “carrier delay has occurred.” I’m never paying for Prime again. [Reply] wow says: January 21, 2016 at 10:34 pm holy crap.. how unbelievably lazy does this article make you sound. unreal. [Reply] NoPrime NoMore says: January 31, 2016 at 3:10 am Like the author, I loved Prime because of rock solid reliable delivery. My stuff was always where I expected it when I expected it with accurate online tracking. This was especially important to me because I work 100 miles from my home, so I’m only home on the weekends. I could order stuff on Tuesday and be sure it would be on my porch by Friday night when I got home. Similarly, I could order on Thursday and have it be at my “work crash” on Monday or Tuesday. Now, with the weird combination of using USPS directly and allowing UPS and Fedex to drop work on USPS at the last second (“last mile handoff”) the reliability has gone to pot. Tracking will look good, say delivered, and the item was not there. Turns out it was delivered to the post office — 40 mile round trip from the home. The USPS does their best, but they won’t deliver to my doorstep, only to the mailbox out by the highway (1/4 mile away). Anything bigger than a breadbox ends up getting a “attempted” note. Even when delivered, it’s an extra day or two. That extra day often meant an extra work week before I got my stuff. Since this USPS change I feel that the two day shipping commitment was not just broken, it was utterly shattered. I’m sure things are better in the burbs, but in my rural area it’s a dismal development. It’s not because of bad USPS people, the local folks are doing their best. It’s just a bad idea. Prime became so unpredictable that I cancelled it and just used the money to help pay for a spot at a mailbox store near work. I now only order free shipping stuff from Amazon, have it delivered there, and I order a lot less from them. I’m ordering more from their competitors as well. I’m actually mostly OK with that, since more of my money is going to local small business instead of the Seattle yuppie. Still, I miss getting my stuff reliably delivered to my doorstep. All the other prime stuff doesn’t matter when your best connection is sub-1-mbit DSL. Prime was worth it because of the shipping, only the shipping, and always the shipping. Not any more. [Reply] Dean P says: February 11, 2016 at 12:31 am I rarely have problems with FedEx, UPS, or USPS, they are all good around here. Amazon is a different story though, I’m not a Prime member, never have been, never will be. Amazon’s order processing is my complaint, in my experience it slowed down very much from what it was a few years ago. The slowdown was gradual but increased until it seemed like Amazon was just sitting on almost every order for days, then for days and days before getting them processed and out their doors. Finally I just gave up and only use them for research and the very occasional order. eBay has become my go-to shop, I carefully peruse reviews on Amazon then go look up the item on eBay, after checking out seller ratings and such, I order. I usually get free shipping but with no minimum purchase required, and yes, I compare prices with and without shipping costs so I know if I’m getting a better deal or just equal to Amazon. I usually do better on eBay. Mind you, you absolutely HAVE TO check out seller ratings to buy from good people, I don’t like any seller with less than 99% positive, it seems like I have problems with lesser ones. Amazon can take a flying leap at a fast train for all I care. And eBay is starting to have buyer reviews too, not many yet, but it’s coming. [Reply] Daniel Lewis says: March 16, 2016 at 5:31 am The USPS situation is very aggravating. I sure do miss the days UPS would leave the package on my porch if I didn’t happen to be home or get the door in time. Now I, like many other Americans, am faced with the dreaded “Delivery Attempted” Pink Slip. The current mailman, who is supposed to deliver parcels in the morning now comes to our house with his Pink Slips pre-filled out and doesn’t even make an attempt to deliver any package over a certain size/weight determined by him! Well I got tired of it. So tired in fact that I took the morning off on the day that I knew there was a package to arrive. I filmed his deed and the conversation I had about it with him. The recording has been accepted by his boss who also gave me the number for the Postal Inspectors (PI) who he said would be able to handle it with a heavier hand. Apparently postal workers get away with a lot and their immediate supervisors’ chidings go on deaf ears. I’ve complained to the boss a few times and he’s fed up too, thus the PI involvement. You don’t have to put up with the poor service by lazy postal workers. Stand up to the USPS and you’ll be surprised to learn that they are nothing more than another service industry. Granted, it is a lot harder to make a complaint that actually effects change, but postal workers like their jobs, especially in our current economy. If you push hard enough they will come around. [Reply] William` says: March 21, 2016 at 3:35 pm It is no surprise when a notice is received or you look on line and track your item with Amazon displaying that your order was delivered. Anytime you are dealing with the “USPS” it is a big maybe with luck that your order will be delivered on time. Amazon should step up to the plate and let you know that though they promise it’s delivery time of your order on a specific date, once the USPS get’s a hold of it, it becomes only a possibility of being delivered on the date promised. Time and time again at our corporate office individuals come up to me commenting that their order is showing that it was delivered, and I have to go through the tedious process of explaining it is probably hovering somewhere at the US Postal Service Office, and hopefully you will receive it in a day or two. Hey Amazon! stop making promises you have no control over. [Reply] Maria says: April 7, 2016 at 12:10 pm I am considering cancelling my Amazon Prime service due to issues with USPS. I don’t want to pay the Amazon Prime fee just to have to drive to the post office in Kingston, NY to pick my packages up because the carrier who delivers mail to the house is too lazy to get out of her truck. USPS is so unreliable and in this case, incompetent. This carrier even misdelivers other people’s Amazon packages to my house; I can’t even imagine where some of mine have ended up. They scan a package as delivered when the package is not delivered, and Amazon has to pay to replace your shipment. I’d rather pay an extra fee to have my orders shipped by UPS rather than deal with the guessing game of what’s going to happen when I place an order. AMAZON you are NOT saving money if you have to constantly replace people’s orders due to USPS bumbling and fraud, and at some point, your Prime members will go elsewhere. [Reply] Ellen says: May 27, 2016 at 3:47 pm I am having the same frustration. Amazon Prime used to be UPS, and regardless, the USPS in our town used to actually deliver packages to your door. After an incident where a mailman got into a fender bender, the regional office made a policy not to drive up driveways where they would have to back up. They only deliver if you have a large, circular driveway. Never mind that my house is about 10 yards from the mailbox. Now, as others have mentioned, Amazon Prime delivers by USPS, which will only leave a slip, not even load the package on the truck, which results in an at minimum one day delay picking up the package. And you have to take time off work. [Reply] Rick says: June 13, 2016 at 4:51 pm I just discovered last week that I had been changed from UPS to U.S.P.S. for Amazon Prime deliveries. I live in Murphy, NC which is a pretty small town. We moved into our home in late February. I have had approximately 24 deliveries form either UPS or FedEx, ironically sometimes they pull up at the same time but don’t talk to each other! My problem is U.S.P.S. will not deliver any mail to my home. My mailbox is about 6 tenths of a mile from my home at the bottom of a small mountain. There rule is if your mailbox is more than 1/2 mile from your home they will not deliver any parcels to your door. So now, every order I place with Amazon is not even attempted for delivery, they just stick the notice of delivery attempt ( what a joke ) in your mailbox. If you don’t pick up the item the next day it will be returned to Amazon. I have spoken with 2 Amazon CSR’s and 1 Amazon CSR Supervisor. Not one of them claimed to know about this agreement with U.S.P.S. I would surely hate to stop using Amazon, I have been a Prime member since 2007. It looks like Amazon has gotten too big for it’s britches. [Reply] Trent says: June 21, 2016 at 9:16 am The problem I have with USPS is not that I ever have to go to the post office to pick something up (never have, never will–Amazon will refund me before I do). The problem is USPS sucks. And sucks hard. I frequently get mail that belongs to my next-door neighbor. I have to wonder how often my own mail never reaches my own mailbox. Packages? Often, they’re supposed to be delivered, but the USPS driver overlooks it. I know this to be the case because there have been a couple times I’ve been working outside, seen the USPS driver pass my house, then drop a package right before leaving the neighborhood. I’ve also seen “Out for delivery” status change to “Delivered” even when they haven’t delivered it. This means they forgot. So far, I’ve gotten it the next delivery day. And right now, a package that was supposed to be delivered today was misdirected by USPS, and is in the entirely wrong state. No idea when I’ll get it. I get that USPS is cheaper than UPS, but there’s a bloody good reason for that. I’d GLADLY pay extra for UPS, Amazon. [Reply] AROD says: August 6, 2016 at 7:44 pm Management is at fault with most of what goes on in the post office. All they are worried about is the carrier street time and that the carriers should be back by 5:00 PM…atleast in NYC. All they do is rush, rush, rush. They are not concerned about the service some carriers provide. [Reply] Vickie White says: September 5, 2016 at 9:37 pm Wow I am overwhelmed by all the negative responses to USPS sunday and holiday delivery for Amazon. First off I want to comment on the mailbox situation. If you don’t have the very large mailbox that many small and medium packages fit in quit your bitching. Your mail carrier is not responsible for rain, theft or your dog that they cannot tell is a threat by the bark and beware of dog signs that are posted. There is no reason on GOD’S earth you need anything other than a prescription delivered on a Sunday or a holiday. Not to mention that by ordering on line you support other countries economic growth but not America’s. So get off your lazy asses and go to a store and support your community and shop there. No worries then about where your purchases end up or when they arrive at your home. Disgruntled postal worker. [Reply] mark rouse says: September 8, 2016 at 4:12 am I will take USPS over UPS any day. I have never had an item lost or damaged by USPS be it shipping or receiving. Cant say the same thing about UPS. [Reply] Dan Brown says: September 15, 2016 at 9:04 pm I think people are having differing experiences is because the work ethic and morale isn’t constant across the Entire USPS. Some major mail hubs are horrible. They also have different delivery tactics in different areas. One mail carrier will concentrate on just packages, and in more rural areas they will be handled by the regular mail carrier. The USPS is also starting to hire private contractors, especially in more rural areas, not always the best trained or qualified. Also, some mail hubs are better than others. Just track a package coming from NYC through New Jersey, or anything going through Allen Park Michigan. [Reply] Ellen in NH says: September 16, 2016 at 2:49 pm My experiences with USPS is horrible when compared with other carriers who deliver very well. My daughter is in an apartment in Burlington, VT with a suite of mailboxes. There are larger boxes used for packages – when a package arrives, a note is put in the mailbox to look in the package box. Works well except on days when more packages arrive than there are boxes available. Then USPS puts a redelivery notice in the mailbox and expects my daughter to pick up at Post Office – problem is there are two PO’s serving that zip – so yesterday she had two slips for going to two different POs for packages. She fills out the slip to have it redelivered to no avail. Doesn’t happen. There is management office upstairs with locked mailroom. All other carriers drop there and the office delivers. USPS won’t because the package is in daughters name, not Mgmt company (but all other carries do it). I’ve asked for a waiver to sign to say they can be delivered to Mgmt office if boxes are full; USPS won’t do it. Instead they take the package back with them and leave the redelivery slip that starts the cycle over for 3 times and then package returns to sender. Geez – I wonder why people are using USPS less and less – could it be the lack of common sense ? Just have students sign a waiver saying the Mgmt Office is OK to leave parcels at. Heck, Fedex and other companies don’t even need that. It is, after all, a locked mail room. Also – I sent a package to my nephew at Christmas. USPS is supposed to use a security code to put package in secure gated area – if they did, he would have received. They didn’t It was DC area, he never got. But heck, I shipped it express, it was insured, so no worries, right? Wrong. They said I needed to prove they didn’t leave in gated area – they didn’t pay. Really? Is that good customer service? I wish Amazon would allow me to pick a carrier. USPS would not be it. [Reply] Bob Fricker says: September 28, 2016 at 11:18 am Misery… USPS delivers to our community mail boxes with shared parcel (larger) boxes. They put the key to Box “F” in our mail box so we can get the parcel… Key Does Not Work! Can’t seem to catch the mail carrier when she delivers and she can’t see the notes we leave in our mail box it seems. Our items are sitting that parcel box 4 or 5 days now. Neither the USPS or Amazon make it easy to remedy the problem of “Delivered” be a misrepresentation of the facts. If you deliver it to some place that I can’t get to, that is not a proper deliver. I see part of the problem as one of poor customer service. USPS is hard to get help from. Try waiting an hour or more for someone to help you on the phone, for example. Try picking your way through their web site and not being able to find any menu or information that addresses your problem, for hours. I don’t tolerate poor service for long as both entities may soon discover. [Reply] Cindy M says: October 1, 2016 at 1:07 am USPS is refusing to deliver packages to my home. They mark my boxes as Vacation Hold and I have to go to the Post Office, wait 30 minutes in line and carry the box to my car myself. Today I picked up a box that was so damaged they gave it to me inside a big black garbage bag. They refused to ship the item back to the sender. I’m currently waiting for a refund from Amazon. As for the Vacation Hold, the postal worker told my that my letter carrier does not want to carry a heavy box, so he marks it as Vac Hold. That alone is unacceptable, but one of the boxes was small enough to fit in my mail box but he still marked as Vac Hold. UPS and Fed Ex are awesome in my area, simply the best. Since Amazon is using USPS I already canceled all my Auto Shipments and will not be renewing my Prime Membership. I will not be buying anything on Amazon until they stop using USPS. If I have to wait in line and carry the box myself, I’ll just shop at the brick and mortar store, at least they have shopping carts. [Reply] sam says: October 26, 2016 at 7:16 pm Get off your but and go shopping then none of this would be a problem. [Reply] Jeff says: October 30, 2016 at 3:58 pm I stopped using Amazon except for the smallest items that I know will fit into my mailbox. I’m going to get a refund on my Prime Membership too because they are not two days any longer. I’ve spent probably around 40 to $50,000 in 4 years at Amazon. That now is being cut down around 90%. The icing on the cake was, a package has been sitting at the post office since October 6 and the 3 times I went to pick it up, the line was 10+ people with one window open. So, I just notified Amazon to take it back. $150 item. Goodbye Amazon. It was great while it lasted. [Reply] Prime says: November 2, 2016 at 10:10 am I thought it was just me. No wonder why every customer service person I spoke to on Saturday wouldn’t answer my question of “why was my package sent via USPS?” They also didn’t respond to me when they’d say, “thank you for being a Prime Member” and I’d say, “I might not be after today.” I spent 45 minutes on the phone with customer service and had to drive to 2 different post offices to get my package. The post offices were open, but didn’t answer their phones. I brought that up to Amazon and the post offices when I went there in person, and no one would talk to me about that. Glad I found this article…….bye bye Prime. [Reply] Matt says: November 12, 2016 at 11:28 am I never had an issue with FedEX, usually don’t have an issue with UPS, but always have an issue with USPS. Either the package is marked delivered and its not or most times, it gets shipped back to Amazon as Package was undeliverable. I wish Amazon would display under an item that delivery is via USPS, so that I would not order the item to start with.

The recent trigger that has brought up rate hike worries all over again is the U.S. consumer price inflation report for August, which came in more than expected, signaling that there is some scope for upward maneuvering of rates. Commodities are all in the red, as the dollar is firming up. In the absence of any major catalysts, traders may prefer to be on the sidelines or lighten their holdings ahead of next week's two major central bank decisions. U.S. stocks advanced solidly on Thursday, with tempered rate hike fears serving as a spring board for the markets to rebound from recent weakness. The major averages opened higher, as traders digested a slew of soft domestic data, which allayed fears concerning a near-term interest rate hike. The averages rose steadily before ending notably higher. The Dow Industrials added 177.71 points or 0.99 percent before ending at 18,213, the S&P 500 Index closed 21.49 points or 1.01 percent higher at 2,147 and the Nasdaq Composite ended at 5,250, up 75.92 points or 1.47 percent. All thirty Dow components closed the session higher, with Apple (AAPL), Intel (INTC), Merck (MRK), Microsoft (MSFT), UnitedHealth (UNH), Caterpillar (CAT), Wal-Mart (WMT) and Procter & Gamble (PG) leading the gains. Among the sectors, semiconductor, computer hardware, brokerage, energy and biotechnology stocks showed notable moves to the upside. On the economic front, the Labor Department reported that jobless claims rose to 260,000 in the week ended September 10th from 259,000 in the previous week. The four-week average eased to 260,750 from 261,250. Continuing claims calculated with a week's lag were little changed at 2.143 million in the week ended September 3rd. The Commerce Department reported that retail sales slipped 0.3 percent month-over-month in August following a revised 0.1 percent gain in July. Excluding autos, retail sales declined a more modest 0.1 percent compared to the 0.4 percent decline in July. Auto sales fell 0.9 percent following July's 1.7 percent jump. The decline in building material and garden equipment store sales steepened to 1.4 percent from 0.7 percent. Miscellaneous store and non-store retail sales also saw notable decreases. However, the drop in furniture and home furnishing store sales slowed to 0.7 percent from 1.1 percent and electronic store sales rebounded by 0.1 percent. Food and beverage sales rebounded. Gasoline store sales fell at a slower pace of 0.8 percent. A separate Commerce Department report showed that business inventories remained virtually unchanged in July compared to the previous month. Annually, inventories climbed 0.5 percent. Business sales edged down 0.2 percent month-over-month and were 0.8 percent lower from last year. The business inventories/sales ratio rose to 1.39 in July from 1.37 in the year-ago period. The Labor Department report on producer prices showed tame inflationary pressure. The producer price index for final demand was unchanged in August compared to the previous month, while economists expected a 0.1 percent increase. The core producer price index for final demand rose at a faster 0.3 percent clip compared to a flat reading in June. The results of the Philadelphia Federal Reserve's business outlook survey showed that its diffusion index of business activity rose sharply to 12.8 in September from 2 in August. However, the inner details were mixed. The new orders index rose to 1.4 from -7.2, while the unfilled orders index was at an anemic -10.8. The shipments index and the employee index were also in negative territory. Meanwhile, the New York Federal Reserve's survey showed that manufacturing activity in the region continued to contract in September. The general business conditions index improved to -1.99 in September from -4.21 in August, while economists expected a reading of -1. The new orders and unfilled orders indexes were at -7.45 and -11.61, respectively. The employment index is deep in the red at -14.29. Industrial production fell 0.4 month-over-month in August, according to a report released by the Federal Reserve. Economists expect a 0.2 percent drop. Manufacturing output also declined 0.4 percent, reversing the 0.4 percent increase in July and steeper than the 0.3 percent drop expected by economists. Capacity utilization eased 0.4 percentage points to 75.5 percent. Currency, Commodity Markets Crude oil futures for October delivery are slipping $0.83 to $43.08 barrel after rising $0.33 to $43.91 a barrel on Thursday. Gold futures are currently trading at $1,312.80 an ounce, down $5 from the previous session's close of $1,318 an ounce, which represented a 2-week low. On Thursday, gold fell $8. 10. On the currency front, the U.S. dollar is trading at 102.01 yen compared to the 102.10 yen it fetched at the close of New York trading on Thursday. Against the euro, the dollar is valued at $1.1201 compared to yesterday's $1.1244. Asia Asian stocks rebounded from a six-week low, encouraged by Wall Street's rally overnight. The markets in China, Hong Kong, Malaysia, South Korea and Taiwan were closed for public holidays. The Japanese market rose as the yen remained subdued at the lower 102-levels. The Nikkei 225 Index opened higher and moved roughly sideways in a broad range in the morning before advancing in the afternoon. The index ended up 114.28 points or 0.70 percent at 16,519. The Australian market rose for a third straight day, as easing Fed rate hike worries helped lift stocks across the board. The All Ordinaries index closed up 59.60 points or 1.12 percent at 5,397. The market witnessed broad based strength, with utility, telecom, consumer discretionary and financial stocks making strong advances. Europe The European markets moved about in a lackluster manner in the morning after rebounding from a 5-session decline yesterday. The averages opened higher but saw a volatile bout in the morning. The averages are currently notably lower, as U.S. inflation data has served to intensify the weakness. In major corporate news, Deutsche Bank (DB) said it has no intent to pay the $14 billion sought by the U.S. Justice Department to settle potential civil claims anywhere near the number cited. U.S. Economic Reports Consumer prices in the U.S. increased by slightly more than expected in the month of August, according to a report released by the Labor Department. The Labor Department said its consumer price index rose by 0.2 percent in August after coming in unchanged in July. Economists had expected prices to inch up by 0.1 percent. Excluding food and energy prices, core consumer prices climbed by 0.3 percent in August after edging up by 0.1 percent in July. Core prices had been expected to rise by 0.2 percent. The University of Michigan is scheduled to release its preliminary U.S. consumer sentiment index for September at 10 am ET. The index is expected to increase to 90.8 from 89.8. Stocks in Focus Oracle (ORCL) reported below-consensus results for its first quarter and issued weak earnings forecast for the second quarter, as its traditional software business weakens. Authentic Brand Group (ABG), General Growth Properties (GGP) and Simon Property Group (SPG) finalized the acquisition of Aeropostale. Standard & Poor's announced that Avis Budget (CAR) will replace Questar (STR) in the S&P MidCap 400 Index after the close of trading on September 16th.

(Contributed photo/Renfroe's Market) Is there anyone who really likes grocery shopping? Probably not. But your shopping experience can differ from store to store and as Daily Meal recently discovered, not all supermarkets are created equal. Daily Meal examined reviews on Google, Yelp, Foursquare and Facebook and analyzed social media posts and check-ins, as well as input from local residents, to determine the best grocery store in each state. Keep in mind, the best grocery store is different than the most popular one in each state, with the second having to do with concentration and number of locations. You can see Alabama's most popular grocery store here. If you're in search of the best grocery store in the state, you will want to look outside the major chains. According to Daily Meal, the state's top supermarket is Renfroe's Market. The locally owned grocery store has two locations in Montgomery and one in Dadeville. Here's how the Daily Meal described Renfroe's: "A longtime Montgomery institution, Renfroe's Market focuses on giving value to every customer's dollar. As one reviewer put it, "Kind of like Wal-Mart and Publix in 1. Layout and selection of Publix but prices like Wal-Mart! Great grocery store!" Welcome to Friday's Wake Up Call. Let's see what's going on today: $24k of fish stolen The city of Villa Rica, Georgia wants to know what happened to its fish. Someone stole $24,000 worth of city-owned koi fish that were at the Pine Mountain Gold Museum. A surveillance camera captured the image of three men that are suspected of being involved in the fish caper. The three men had fishing poles, officials said, and are believed to have made off with at least eight fish valued at $3,000 each. Giant meteorite uncovered One of the largest meteorites ever discovered has been unearthed in Argentina. Scientists said the meteorite, dubbed Gancedo, weighs about 30 tons. It's thought it smashed into the Earth more than 4,000 years ago. If all the tests check out, Gancedo would be the third largest meteorite ever found. The largest, unearthed in Africa, weighs in at 66 tons. Woman in infamous heroin photo jailed The Ohio grandmother whose image went viral after a photo of her and a friend passed out in a car from an apparent heroin overdose – all while her 4-year-old grandson was in the backseat – will spend the next 180 days in jail. Rhonda Pasek pleaded no contest to of endangering a child, public intoxication, and a seat belt violation. Court officials said she will be required to serve her full 180 day sentence. James Lee Acord, 47, who was arrested with Pasek, has also pleaded no contest and is serving a 360 day sentence for endangering a child and other charges. Pasek, 50, was arrested Sept. 7. She had been raising the 4-year-old boy, and his 3-year-old brother, because her son and his girlfriend were unable to care for the children. The boys have now been placed with their great aunt and uncle in South Carolina. Part of missing Malaysian plane found A large item of debris found off the coast of Tanzania is part of the missing Malaysia Airlines Fight MH370, officials said. The debris is part of the outboard flap of the plane. It was found in June but its source was just confirmed by Australian investigators. MH370 vanished in March 2014 as it flew from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people on board, prompting a massive search. It's believed the plane crashed into the southern Indian Ocean.

September 16, 2016 at 9:24 a.m. Maybe he mistakenly thought that Mr. Givens was the one who had rented the room at Holiday Inn Express for the woman that he (Sammie) had beaten previously. ( permalink | suggest removal ) Nodmcm says... September 16, 2016 at 9:31 a.m. Its hard to believe he made it to 38, what with beating women and shooting strangers on the street, without already having received his life term. But there are some tough, hard men in Arkansas, and some of them don't live in the prisons at Grady and Tucker. ( permalink | suggest removal ) Murphy01 says... September 16, 2016 at 10:12 a.m. According to the obituary MR. Givens was a black man. I'm expecting the BLM bus to arrive in Conway any minute now. I'm also going to assume Wendell Griffen will be preaching about this Sunday morning? ( permalink | suggest removal ) HarleyOwner says... September 16, 2016 at 11:40 a.m. Murphy01, From the mugshot, Thomas looks to be black. So, if Mr Givens is black, this makes it just another black on black crime. Which means the BLM group will have no interest in it.

Enough evidence has now accumulated to suggest that it is already happening. The latest data, courtesy of the Census Bureau, which released its annual update on incomes and poverty on Tuesday, showed that median household income increased a whopping 5.2 percent in 2015 to an inflation-adjusted $56,516. As the New York Times, noted, it was “the largest single-year increase since record-keeping began in 1967.” Some killjoys will note that median household income was $57,909 in 1999. That’s true, but the dot-com crash, housing bust and the credit crisis managed to cut that a lot. Median incomes fell 2.59 percent from 2000 to 2004, before almost rebounding to the pre-crisis peak. After 2007, the collapse was greater — a 4.94 percent drop that bottomed in 2013. Ignore the naysayers; the most recent numbers were a huge positive surprise, showing that incomes for all Americans are rising in a meaningful way. Unlike in recent years, when much of the gains went to an increasingly narrow group at the top of the economic strata, last year’s improvements were broad and deep. “Gains were spread across the income spectrum and by race, while women’s earnings inched closer to men’s,” Bloomberg reported. This is yet more evidence of a job market that, as we previously noted, is not getting weaker but stronger — despite the occasional disappointing number. Of particular surprise to many was that the strongest gains were found among the lowest earners. To what shall we attribute these gains? Four things deserve most of the credit: More people working: The big year-over-year change in employment, with almost 2.5 million more Americans working now than a year earlier, contributed to a meaningful change in total household income. Corporate pay increases: Some of the U.S.’s largest employers, such as McDonald’s and Wal-Mart, have played a significant role in raising incomes at the lower end of the income distribution. Wal-Mart in particular made substantial increases in wages for its lowest-paid employees. These increases stand in sharp contrast to the company’s pay policies of just a few years ago. Note that the increases are not just a public-relations effort, but due to the competitive labor environment; higher pay is needed to recruit and retain workers (and because workers demoralized by the low pay and unappealing employment conditions were hurting the shopping experience for Wal-Mart customers). Minimum wage laws: Pay increases aren’t just voluntarily; after many years of little change in state and local minimum wage laws, increases mandated by legislation are kicking. That means the lowest-paid workers have seen pay rise in a number of cities and states. Economic cycle: We are now in the latter stages of an economic recovery. Typically, we see wage pressure and inflation at some point in the cycle, although usually much earlier than this. But this isn’t the typical postwar recovery — it is a recovery from a financial crisis. These rebounds are longer and slower than others, as excesses of the credit boom must be worked off. The deleveraging process takes a long time. The latest data is unequivocally good for households; what investors need to do is consider what this might mean more broadly. Rising incomes have ramifications for inflation, Federal Reserve policy, interest rates, retail spending, auto sales and residential real estate; it might even play a part in the presidential election. More than seven years have passed since the last bear market and the Great Recession ended. The recovery has been slow and fitful, and hasn’t always been very convincing for many Americans. This improvement was a long time coming. Greet it with open arms. Ritholtz, a Bloomberg View columnist, is the founder of Ritholtz Wealth Management. He is a consultant at and former chief executive officer for FusionIQ, a quantitative research firm.

I suppose you take to heart everything the BLS says as gospel, too. Hate to burst your economic bubble Barry, but you should read the Harvard Business School study on how the U.S. economy really is under the Obama Administration, "Problems Unsolved and a Nation Divided", September 2016. It aint pretty. As Obama is a Harvard alumnus (allegedly, since they won't release any papers he wrote while there), you would of thought they'd have easy on the guy. Also, you might peruse Thad Beversdorf at FirstRebuttal.com and his article spelling out the 88% chance that the U.S. has just entered a recession. Jus' saying..... I am Lalek.

I'm not lazy, I'm agoraphobic. I used to spend my days at work, my nights in Manhattan, and my weekends filled with adventure and road trips. Now, if I am able to leave my house for a medical appointment, it’s an accomplishment.  I’ve had “episodes” that lasted months, where I’d be unable to leave my bed — not because I’m lazy, but out of fear. Tumblr I suffer from a very misunderstood disease called agoraphobia, which is the fear of open spaces (a very generalized definition). When I tell people, their first response is, “What? You’re afraid of spiders?” No, that would be arachnophobia. TheOdysseyOnline To be honest, I’m not even entirely sure of how I came to be this way, so I don’t judge those who don't understand. It started some time in 2013. It wasn’t a conscious decision; I just stopped leaving my home. My husband would ask if I wanted to go out, and my answer was always no. Neither one of us actually realized how long it had been since I’d left until a month or two in when my husband looked at me and said, “Wait. When was the last time you left?” and I couldn’t answer. Grocery stores were impossible (and still are), Target, Walmart, any store with more than one department is completely out of the question.  Imgur You may wonder how the hell I survive parenting without actually leaving the house? I’d be lying if I came up with any response other than, “I have no idea!” I take it day by day. I’m lucky enough to have a very supportive husband, who takes care of all the “outside” stuff I’m unable to. He brings my son to the park, does the food shopping, etc.  When I do go out, my husband HAS to be with me. I can’t go hang out with friends, or run to the store without him; to me, he’s like the security blanket little kids take EVERYWHERE. Tumblr Am I thrilled with how my life is? Not exactly, but every day, I work on it. I try and make trips to the store with my husband, though most of the time, I remain a passenger in the car and don’t actually venture into the store. I have gone to my son’s doctor appointments; basically, anything essential, I find a way to do it. Whether it’s taking an extra dose of anti-anxiety medicine (approved by my psychiatrist), or practicing breathing exercises to calm my nerves, I find a way. If you invite me to a picnic or BBQ at your house, it’s pretty much a given that I will not attend. All my friends know this and have already stopped inviting me, either to ease the pressure off me or just because, why bother? Tumblr So, what does it feel like when I’m forced outside of my comfort zone? It feels like I’m trapped in a tunnel, with every terrorist and mass murderer that has ever lived. Everyone is a suspect, not based on race or gender. I can see Big Bird and be suspicious and scared. My mind automatically goes into defense mode: Does this person have a gun? Does this person intend to carjack the vehicle I’m idling in? Will this be the next location of a mass shooting? Because you never think it’ll happen to you until it does, so I keep that in mind. I don’t care how safe or friendly your neighborhood is, it can happen anywhere.  When my husband and son go out, I worry it’s the last time I’ll see them. What if there’s an attack? All the “what ifs?” go through my brain at a pace I can hardly keep up with while I try to ignore it. Imgur And unfortunately, my brain can’t turn off that part of itself to allow me to enjoy outside activities like others do.  I can’t tell if I’m the product of the society we currently live in or if I would have been this way no matter what. All I know is that every time I make it past my front door, it’s a tiny victory in my life. And I know that one day, I’ll overcome this, because I want to live life outside of my comfort zone. I want to live life as a person who’s free from irrational fears. I want to show my son that despite the world we live in, and the scary things that happen daily, the world can be a pretty great place. 19 Quotes For When Anxiety Feels Completely Overwhelming Click to view (19 images) Photo: weheartit Rebecca Jane StokesEditor Buzz Read Later like us on facebook If you 'like' us, we'll LOVE you!

Walmart Proponents to Present at Pittsfield Ward 1 & 2 Meeting By Andy McKeeveriBerkshires Staff 02:19AM / Friday, September 16, 2016Print | Email PITTSFIELD, Mass. — The developers looking to build a Walmart Supercenter at the William Stanley Business Park will present their plans at a meeting on Monday.   Waterstone Realty is proposing a new 190,000 square-foot super center on a parcel known as "the teens." Walmart would then vacate its currently location at Berkshire Crossing and would have its retail branch find a replacement for that building. The project has received a letter of intent from the Pittsfield Economic Development Authority to pursue permitting as well as negotiate a lease-to-own agreement for the land.   The company has not yet filed a formal proposal to city officials but the concept has been presented to the public at multiple forums and mediums since June. Ward 1 Councilor Lisa Tully and Ward 2 Councilor Kevin Morandi organized Monday's meeting to let residents hear the plans, ask questions, and start the dialogue over what has become a contentious issue.   "We just want to give the opportunity to the people, to let them know what this is about, and give us feedback," Morandi said on Thursday.   The presentation is put on by the two councilors, but anyone is welcomed to attend. Morandi says he hopes for a good attendance.    Representatives from the company will give a presentation at 6 p.m. at Morningside Community School. That will be followed by a question-and-answer session. The parcel in question borders Ward 1 and 2 and the councilors plan to hold three different public sessions throughout the process.    "We know how important this is as an issue so the more feedback, the more they can learn about the project, the better," Morandi said. "This is probably going to be a six-month process."   The issue has many aspects to it. Firstly, the land is formerly owned by General Electric and was passed to PEDA for development. PEDA has been working for years to find industrial suitors, which some say was the original intent of the park, but was unsuccessful. This is the third time Waterstone has attempted to develop the parcel into mixed-use and retail.    The company says it will be spending some $12 million on foundation work as part of the $30 million project. That work will address a stormwater system issue in which PCBs are still washing downstream and into Silver Lake. But, it will also include containing the PCBs in the soil. The foundational issues has been cited by city officials as being one of the major holdups to finding a developer.   Further the company is also looking to fix the intersection of Tyler Street, Woodlawn Avenue, and Dalton Avenue, which the city hoped to do with a federal grant, which it was not awarded. Lastly, the company says the development will help spur other companies to move onto the land near the Walmart.    It is estimated that the new project will boost tax revenue by some $300,000 to $500,000.   "Anytime someone wants to come in, it is the city's job to listen to them," Morandi said.   But many in opposition to the deal have raised concerns about Walmart's business practices and its impacts to nearby local businesses, and giving up for retail one of the few large spaces available for industry.    The issue also comes at a time when the city is in the middle of the Transformative Development Initiative, which is crafting a long-term vision for the future of the neighborhood.   Morandi says he hopes Monday's meeting will help set the groundwork for the community conversation around the project as it moves along.   Related Recent Walmart Stories: PEDA Extends Negotiation Period With Waterstone August 17, 2016 | 04:30PM The Pittsfield Economic Development Authority extended the timeframe to reach an land lease agreement with Waterstone Realty for the development of a Walmart Supercenter. On Tuesday, PEDA approved the extension to the letter of intent. Executive Director Corydon Thurston said the original 60-day window was "too aggressive" and hopes to have an agreement before the board by the next meeting. Pittsfield Council Wants Public Forum On Walmart... August 13, 2016 | 06:24AM The City Council wants a chance to ask the proponents of a new Walmart at the William Stanley Business Park some questions. However, the council needs another organization to host a discussion to avoid legal conflicts. So, the council agreed to ask the Pittsfield Economic Development Authority to host one with the developer Waterstone Realty in the City Council chambers.

July 31, 2016 | 06:15AM Joe Castoldi has run his barber shop for years on Tyler Street, just a block away from where the proposed Walmart Supercenter is eyed to be built.

July 08, 2016 | 09:30AM Walmart's Director of Public Affairs & State and Local Government Relations Chris Buchanan says, "holding out hope for industrial development of the site does a disservice to the residents of Pittsfield." He said the cost to remediate the land, fix the stormwater runoff, and road work adds up to $12 million, a cost few companies would bear when there are other properties for development at a lower cost. House Candidate Bloomberg Opposes Pittsfield's Walmart... July 06, 2016 | 02:51PM In an interview on Wednesday, Bloomberg argued that despite increased jobs and tax revenue, the city's long-term economic picture is hindered by such a development.

July 01, 2016 | 03:44AM As the proposed Walmart Supercenter debate begins to unfold, the developer's claims of increased tax revenue reflects what happened in North Adams.

The gravel bed had been assessed at $1,613,800 and the redevelopment upped the value to $10,694,900, according to Ross Vivori, chairman of the North Adams Board of Assessors.

June 27, 2016 | 01:53AM Part of the selling point for the new Walmart at the William Stanley Business Park is that it will ease an environmental burden on PEDA coming down the road. Last year, the Environmental Protection Agency issued a new draft permit for the Pittsfield Economic Development Agency's ability to drain stormwater into Silver Lake. That permit called for significantly better water quality than currently being done. PEDA has argued against it, saying it doesn't have the money to make the needed improv Walmart Looking to Move to William Stanley Business...

He is considered a person of interest at this time. RUSSELLVILLE – A $5,000 reward is being offered in an effort to try and find out who is responsible for the burglary of a Russellville pawn shop and theft of a large number of guns. According to information from Michael Knight of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the burglary took place during the early morning hours of Sept. 3 at Mike’s Pawn II. Police Chief Chris Hargett said the business is located on U.S. 43 just past Wal-Mart, near Akins Funeral Home. Authorities said around 60 guns were taken from the business. “After they took the guns, the building was set on fire,” said investigator Sgt. Jake Tompkins. Reports indicate the building was destroyed by the fire. Tompkins said the fire was intentionally set. “Evidence was found that indicated that the fire was arson,” Tompkins said. Knight said ATF is offering a $2,500 reward, which will be matched by the National Shooting Sports Foundation for a total reward of up to $5,000. Officials said the reward is part of a cooperative initiative between the NSSF and ATF in cases involving the theft of firearms from federally licensed firearms retailers. Tompkins said police are looking for a man who is considered to be a person of interest. “Not a suspect, but a person of interest,” Tompkins said. “We would love to talk with this person to see what he knows about the burglary.” Tompkins said the burglary was reported to authorities at 3:46 a.m. He said the burglars got into the business by damaging a back wall. ATF officials said investigators are in the process of conducting an inventory to determine the exact number of guns taken. Anyone with information about the burglary and arson is asked to contact the ATF at 800-ATF-GUNS (1-800-283-4867), the Russellville Police Department at 256-332-2230, or Shoals Crime Stoppers at 256-386-8685. Information can also be sent to ATF via the mobile app www.reportit.com by using the Nashville Field Division as the location. The Russellville Police Department, ATF and the Alabama State Fire Marshal’s office are involved in the investigation. tom.smith@timesdaily.com or 256-740-5757.

Photo By David Carson, dcarson@post-dispatch.com Would you go to a Cardinals game, see a long line of people waiting to enter Busch Stadium, walk to the front of the line and cut in ahead of those waiting? Would you go to Walmart with its long lines and cut in front of the people waiting? I hope the answer in both examples is no. If that is true, then why do so many people think it is OK for them to bypass the line of cars on northbound Highway 141 to cut in at the last second to take the exit for the Page Avenue Extension? As a commuter who travels this road each day, I have been horrified to see the accidents, near-accidents and intense road rage caused by these people. In case you have not realized it, you are telling all of us who are waiting in line that you consider your life to be much more important than anyone else’s. Because you are in a car, you somehow feel that you are not seen by others. Guess what: You are wrong. Everyone in that line can see who you are. So, the next time you are asking for help for your child at school, that teacher you are talking with may have been the driver you cut off the night before. The next time you are at the emergency room pleading for help, that nurse may have been the driver who you forced off the road when you almost slammed into her yesterday. Until people grow up or the local municipalities decide to add a double white line to separate traffic (as was done on Interstate 270 northbound at Interstate 70), this will continue to be a very dangerous section of road every night. I pray that happens before there are more accidents or that road rage escalates to a dangerous point. I ask that all of us take a second to think about others before we drive past a mile-long line of cars and dart in just in time to take the exit. Steve Starr  •  O'Fallon, Mo.

Getting from A to B without a vehicle is difficult in Victoria, said Corpus Christi resident Teresa Longoria. "I do find it kind of crazy how they don't have too many lights out there," said Longoria, 26. Thursday, Longoria, who was struck by a car Wednesday night, rested in a room at Citizens Medical Center, recovering from a concussion, road rash and a torn ligament in her leg. Longoria, who is 19 weeks pregnant with a girl she will name Jae'La, was struck by a blue Honda Civic before 10 p.m. Wednesday on Houston Highway just outside Motel 6, where she was staying. The driver of the Civic, Melissa Longoria, no relation, was uninjured and not cited, said Victoria police Sgt. Lee Lemmons. Teresa Longoria was attempting to walk to Wal-Mart, which was less than 2,000 feet from her motel room - a trip she has made multiple times in the past. "I went flying and went over the car and hit the back side," Longoria said. "I rolled off and (then) landed on my right side." Despite the severity of the impact, Longoria said she and her unborn baby are OK, albeit a little sore. Longoria was talking on the phone with Jae'La's father, 24-year-old Kristopher Durst, of Victoria, when she was struck. "It scared him because all he heard was me saying, 'Ow!'" she said. Longoria admits she could have used a crosswalk at Sam Houston Drive to cross Houston Highway. But because she has never had problems crossing in Corpus Christi or Victoria until Wednesday, she felt confident walking across Houston Highway without a crosswalk. Although she may be physically all right, Longoria said her perception of Victoria is not. A lack of pedestrian amenities has in part convinced her she does not want move to Victoria, she said. "The city could do better with lights and crosswalks," she said. "I noticed there are not too many sidewalks out here."

Suburbs Aurora Beacon-News Aurora News School comes together to raise money for 9-year-old's rare cancer treatment Juan and Carlos Romero Sarah Freishtat / The Beacon-News Juan Romero, right, is looking to raise money to help with a type of cancer treatment for his son, Carlos. Juan Romero, right, is looking to raise money to help with a type of cancer treatment for his son, Carlos. (Sarah Freishtat / The Beacon-News) Sarah FreishtatAurora Beacon-News Privacy Policy Carlos Romero likes playing video games and going to Taco Bell with his dad, activities he described as "typical boy things." The 9-year-old Aurora boy used to play piano and take karate lessons, until he was diagnosed when he was 7 with osteosarcoma, a type of bone cancer. His father, Juan Romero, said Carlos didn't need to worry about the extra activities through chemotherapy treatments, leg surgery and three lung surgeries he underwent to combat tumors that kept coming back. After years of treatments, Romero, is now looking to a drug that has not been approved in the U.S., but is used in Europe, to keep his son's cancer at bay. The treatment will cost tens-of-thousands of dollars that Romero will have to pay up front, a spokeswoman for Chicago's Ann and Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital said, so Carlos' West Aurora elementary school has organized fundraisers to help. Romero is an involved McCleery Elementary School parent, Principal Kathy Kostos said. Romero said he drops off Carlos and his younger sister in the morning, stops by during the day to drop off medicine for Carlos and then picks up his children, before going to Wal-Mart to work his 5:30 to 11 p.m. shift. "(Carlos is) one of our students," Kostos said. "And we want to do what we can to try and help him out. It's important to us to help any of our kids." Carlos was, at first, diagnosed with a tumor in his leg. He had surgery to remove it, had a metal rod put into his leg, and had to learn to walk again — a process Carlos compared to beating all of the levels on a video game, only to have the game accidentally uninstalled and having to work through each level again. He spent a year in and out of the hospital, one week in for treatment, two weeks home, Romero said. Through his treatments, he completed his schoolwork and stayed on pace.

Ailani Banuelos received a celebrity welcome with a stream of yellow balloons when she arrived at McCarty Elementary School in Aurora. The surprise welcome for the 10-year-old McCarty student, complete with T-shirts in Ailani's favorite blue and the release of 25 white doves, celebrated her final... (Linda Girardi) His family thought he was cured, until they found cancer in his lung in August 2015. Romero said he traveled across the country seeking information and treatment for Carlos. Carlos ultimately had three lung surgeries to remove tumors that kept coming back. During the latest surgery, shortly before the start of the 2016 school year, doctors removed part of his lung. Romero said the family has tried to avoid words like "tumor" and "cancer." If a commercial for a children's cancer hospital comes on TV, they change the channel. Carlos doesn't know he's missing part of his lung, and refers to his cancer in past tense, Romero said. He said Carlos is smart and happy. "Why I've got to give to him worries, in his mind, that he may die?" he said. Now, Romero is looking to a drug called Mepact for Carlos. Though not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, it is used in other countries, said Julie Pesch, a spokeswoman for Lurie Children's Hospital. Cancer survivor inspires others David Sharos Aurora resident Sylvia Forsberg, who defied doctors' expectations in beating cancer — twice — and inspired a host of people along the way, was honored by Rush-Copley Medical Center as part of a national day of recognition for those reaching milestones in their fight against the disease.

Aurora resident Sylvia Forsberg, who defied doctors' expectations in beating cancer — twice — and inspired a host of people along the way, was honored by Rush-Copley Medical Center as part of a national day of recognition for those reaching milestones in their fight against the disease. "I've lived... (David Sharos) Romero said he talked with a U.S. doctor and "so many people in different countries" about the medication. He said he sought help from local elected officials to be able to use the drug in this country. "That's all what we have for him," Romero said. "We don't have more medicine to cure this cancer." Pesch said the drug was studied in the U.S. in the 1990s, but the results were conflicting and it ultimately was not approved by the FDA. Carlos will need two, $24,000 dosages of the medication over a six-month time frame, Pesch said. Since the family is not able to use the medicine under the "compassionate use" designation — which typically refers to the treatment of someone who is seriously ill using an unapproved drug, if no other treatments are available — and because it is not FDA-approved, Carlos' family will have to pay the cost up front to the drug company, Pesch said. "It's laudable, what this father and family are doing, to try this," said Kathleen Keenan, another Lurie spokeswoman. "If the hospital thought there were zero possibility and it were worthless, we'd never be on board with it." McCleery elementary school is looking to help with the expense. Assistant Principal Jalitza Martinez helped organize an exercise event last Saturday, with area instructors and special guests leading exercise classes and workouts. A local recording artist was set to sing during Zumba class, she said. School staff is also helping organize a fundraiser Sept. 22 at Luigi's Pizza and Fun Center on Aurora's near West Side, with all-you-can-east pizza and pasta and raffle prizes. "Right away, our staff wanted to do something and help in any way they could," Kostos, the principal, said. Kostos said it took some convincing before Romero was willing to let the school help. Kostos said the school helped him set up a GoFundMe page for Carlos in February. Now, he is seeking to raise $100,000 for Carlos' treatment. Kostos said Carlos is a "motivated learner." His dad took him to the library to check out books over the summer, and the school gave him books to read while he was in the hospital, she said. Carlos has tried to come to school as long as he feels well enough, though some days he goes home early and some days he misses school entirely, Kostos said. Still, his attendance overall has been good, she said. Before Carlos was diagnosed with cancer, he would study multiplication and fractions with his dad outside of school. He wasn't allowed to play video games. Now, Carlos is allowed to play in moderation, Romero said. He doesn't want to push Carlos unnecessarily. Carlos said he is planning to be a teacher. He wants two kids, and he wants them to be smart, to grow up and have their own families. "I've been really looking forward to growing up and being a good father," he said. sfreishtat@tribpub.com Twitter @srfreish Copyright © 2016, Aurora Beacon-News Drugs and Medicines State's attorney says stiff Aurora murder sentence sends message Oswego considers decriminalizing marijuana School in Aurora named second best in the nation Breaking Sports Trending Opinion Suburbs Entertainment Business Advertising 61°

Police have not identified the gunman and his father, who was found dead at the scene, but the Tarrant County medical examiner's office confirmed Martin Craig Fleece, 55, and Carl Fleece, 81, were the two men fatally shot in the 3800 block of Wharton Drive, according to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram.  Martin Craig Fleece Hood County Sheriff's Office After officers were called to the home about 8:30 p.m. Friday, they found Carl Fleece dead inside the home with a gunshot wound to his head.  Although a report of a suicide brought them to the home, police have not said who fired the shot. Officers were told a witness to the shooting had gone to a shed in the backyard. When they approached the shed, Craig Fleece opened fire, police said. Fort Worth Officers Xavier Serrano and Ray Azucena were struck by bullets but are expected to survive. Fort Worth Police Chief Joel Fitzgerald said in a statement released Saturday, "[the officers'] prognosis is very good and they are both expected to make a full recovery from their wounds and a return to their job of protecting and serving our citizens." We appreciate everyone's thoughts and prayers, FWPD Officers Serrano (left) and Azucena (right) are recovering well. pic.twitter.com/L6pFF356yp— Fort Worth Police (@fortworthpd) September 17, 2016 Hours after Craig Fleece shot at the officers, SWAT team members were able to approach the shed, where they found him dead with multiple gunshot wounds. It is not known whether those wounds were self-inflicted or from police gunfire. Family tensions A neighbor told the Star-Telegram there seemed to be recurring problems with Craig Fleece. Carl Fleece and his wife, Vaneda, lived in the home and their son stayed in the backyard shed for most of the last 20 years, the neighbor said. Carl was a retired lieutenant colonel in the Air Force and a decorated B-52 pilot who was known for his kindness. Carl Fleece was a retired lieutenant colonel in the Air Force and a decorated B-52 pilot. Fort Worth Star-Telegram "They are wonderful, wonderful people," the neighbor told the Star-Telegram. "Very soft-spoken, never poked their noses in other people's business, kept to themselves." But the topic of the son, he said, seemed to be a sore spot. "They didn't talk much about him, but they did mention they were having a difficult time with him," Ron said. "Every time it got brought up ... [Carl Fleece] would get upset about it." Another neighbor, Jesse Guadina, said the police had been at the Fleeces' home at least six times during the last three years because of their son.  "If he wasn't causing trouble to his parents, he was causing trouble to his brother," Guadina said. Troubled past Craig Fleece had a past fraught with criminal and manic behavior. In 1998, he was accused of trying to kill a man in Louisiana. The charge was pleaded down to attempted manslaughter, and he was ordered to serve six months in prison and five years probation. While on probation in 2004 for the Louisiana incident, Fleece stole an ambulance in Fort Worth and made purchases with a debit card he found inside. He told police he got into the ambulance to get warm and drove off when looks from passers-by made him uncomfortable.  He stopped at a Wal-Mart, where he used the debit card to buy cleaning supplies to clean the ambulance, he told police. Fleece said he had planned to drive the ambulance to a friend's house in Lancaster where he could clean it up, but decided to drive it back to Fort Worth and ran out of gas. A psychologist testified that Craig Fleece, who suffered from bipolar disorder and appeared to be in the middle of a manic episode when he stole the ambulance, thought he might get a job if he cleaned the vehicle.  The court decided the testimony was irrelevant, and Fleece was sentenced to three years for debit card abuse and unauthorized use of a motor vehicle.

Proper fencing with regular maintenance to repair any holes cut by trespassers will largely take care of access to the rail yard. But in the far broader picture an overpass should be  considered as a needed method of foot and cyclist transit to better connect what is now a divided city. Save for the sidewalks of the Sande Overpass, at the far western end of the rail yard, and constituting a significant  journey for those on foot or on a bike, there is now no access between the southside and the northside of the city for the long stretch from the Sande Overpass to the area of Walmart. It’s a significant omission for southside residents who deserve the opportunity of access to the majority of the city’s recreational, shopping and other services on the northside. Consider the large amount of social and low income housing on the southside in the area east of Mills Memorial Hospital to near Walmart – which could soon be bolstered should a Ksan House Society apartment building be constructed in that neighbourhood – and the need for a pedestrian and cyclist overpass is even more obvious. Of all the needs facing the city, this is one of the more doable.

X What is this? Sponsored content is written by Global News' without any editorial influence by the sponsor. If you'd like to learn more... - A A + Listen There’s a new venture underway by one Halifax community to try and help address food insecurity. The Bayers Westwood Community Centre recently launched a pop-up food market. The neighbourhood is home to the largest public housing area in the city and organizers say many of the residents use the food bank. Donna Sutton Lahmar, director of the centre, says because of this, access to fresh fruit and vegetables is limited. “We as a centre thought it was really important to bring this service to the community, which everyone can just tap into,” said Lahmar. WATCH: Halifax ranked lowest city in Canada for food affordability  Lahmar says the group community centre purchases the food at cost from a local vender and also sells every item at cost. All of the vegetables and fruit at the market are under $2. “It’s actually cheaper than Superstore. Some things are a little cheaper than Walmart, but for the most part things are cheaper than the Superstore,” she said. Organizers decided to start the market as a way to help provide the community with access to fresh food #Halifax pic.twitter.com/3KsCbJORjv — Natasha Pace (@NatashaPace) September 17, 2016 Many volunteers at the pop-up market are members of the Syrian community who recently arrived in Halifax. This is the sixth weekend the market has been held, with it selling out of food every time. Lahmar says the idea is part of a pilot project that will run until the end of October and then restart in May. Follow @NatashaPace © 2016 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.

Court news: Teen requests speedy trial on 12 charges Mike Emery , mwemery@pal-item.com 4:49 p.m. EDT September 17, 2016 Rodney W. Blevins II (Photo: Supplied) 9 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE One of three Richmond residents arrested for an August weekend crime spree has exercised his right to a speedy trial. Rodney W. Blevins II, 19, of the 1500 block of South 11th Street requested the speedy trial during a Sept. 2 initial hearing in Wayne Superior Court II. His trial was scheduled for 9 a.m. Oct. 3. Blevins was formally charged with 10 felonies and two misdemeanors after his Aug. 29 arrest along with Zachary T. Peacock and Ashley N. Sparks. He is charged with three counts of burglary (a Level 2 and two Level 4 felonies), four counts of conspiracy to commit burglary (a Level 2 and three Level 4 felonies), conspiracy to commit armed robbery (a Level 3 felony), attempt to commit burglary (a Level 4 felony), robbery (a Level 5 felony) and two counts of theft (both Class A misdemeanors). Blevins, Peacock and Sparks were arrested after police responded to a domestic dispute call. During the investigation, officers came across a gun they were told was stolen during a home burglary then was used in a series of crimes. Most of the crimes allegedly occurred from Aug. 26-Aug. 28. Because he was wanted for allegedly violating terms of a pretrial drug diversion program, Blevins has remained in the Wayne County Jail since his arrest. He faces charges of fraud (a Level 6 felony) and theft (a Class A misdemeanor) in that case, which is scheduled for an Oct. 24 trial. Peacock and Sparks were released on their own recognizance when the court didn't receive formal charges within 48 hours of their arrests, but they were arrested again Sept. 1 during RPD's investigation of a possible robbery in the 1200 block of Ridge Street. Zachary T. Peacock  (Photo: Supplied) Peacock, 20, of the 3800 block of Endsley Road now faces the same 12 charges as Blevins in one case and is charged with Level 6 felony attempt to commit residential entry in the second case. Peacock, who remains in the jail, also faces a probation violation following his release this year from prison after he served a seven-year sentence for armed robbery and burglary for using a handgun to rob the Clark station at 100 Richmond Ave. in 2013. Both new cases and the petition to revoke probation are scheduled for trial on Dec. 6 in Wayne Circuit Court, Ashley N. Sparks  (Photo: Supplied) Sparks, 25, of the 500 block of South West 16th Street faces four counts of aiding or inducing burglary (a Level 2 and three Level 4 felonies), four counts of conspiracy to commit burglary (a Level 2 and three Level 4 felonies), aiding or inducing armed robbery (a Level 3 felony), conspiracy to commit armed robbery (a Level 3 felony) and two counts of aiding or inducing theft (Class A misdemeanors). In her second case, Sparks, who remains jailed, is charged with Level 5 felony intimidation and Level 6 felony attempt to commit residential entry. A trial on the second case is scheduled for Nov. 28 in Superior II, but no trial has been scheduled for the first case, according to court records. Liberty man's trial set for Nov. 29 A Liberty man's trial in two cases has been scheduled for Nov. 29 in Circuit Court. James Goubeaux, 32, of the 400 block of North Woodland Court was arrested Aug. 28 after a nearly nine-hour manhunt. James Goubeaux  (Photo: Supplied) The hunt began after the alleged use of a stolen credit card at Richmond's Wal-Mart and continued with two burglary incidents. He was captured after he told good Samaritans helping him that he was lost, and they asked officers to help him find his way. He was formally charged with theft and attempted fraud (both Level 6 felonies) in one case and with two counts of burglary (Level 4 felonies) in the second case. He also is accused of being a habitual offender in the second case. Goubeaux, who remains jailed, also has a plea and sentencing hearing set for 2:30 p.m. Oct. 24 in Randolph County on charges of conversion and driving while suspended (both Class A misdemeanors). A woman who tried to use a stolen credit card at Wal-Mart was caught on foot on nearby Avon Lane as Goubeaux began eluding police. Ashley R. Reed  (Photo: Supplied) Ashley R. Reed, 33, of the 1500 block of South Ninth Street in Richmond is formally charged with attempt to commit fraud and two counts of theft (all Level 6 felonies). In a previous case, she is charged with theft and unlawful possession of a syringe (both Level 6 felonies). Her trials also are scheduled for Nov. 29 in Circuit Court. 9 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://pinews.co/2cuzhGS TOP VIDEOS Ben Sullivan signs with West Point 1:10 Hollingsworth signs with IUPUI Tennis 0:55 Richmond boys basketball prepares for 2016-17 2:03 Knights sign for college programs 0:52 Hagerstown wins volleyball regional 1:37 Officer Tim Davis teaches Halloween safety lessons 3:34 RPD investigates North 15th shooting 1:24 Richmond qualifies for state tennis 2:34 Indiana 1 accident injures both drivers Oct. 3, 2016 0:54 Centerville celebrates huge victory 0:32 More Stories Wayne County residents wonder what's to come for Obamacare Nov. 17, 2016, 7:27 p.m. Educators look for usable data in ISTEP scores Nov. 17, 2016, 5:31 p.m. Chase nets 1 suspect near Abington; 1 gets away Nov. 17, 2016, 4:31 p.m. Go: Electric violin, comedy, crafts and more Nov. 16, 2016, 8:27 p.m.

So Where’s the Party? No sooner had the renewables industry gained lucrative U.S. subsidies than there was a steep decline in power-purchase deals. Eric Roston eroston Brian Eckhouse brianreports September 16, 2016 — 8:00 AM EDT Share on FacebookShare on Twitter Share on LinkedInShare on RedditShare on Google+E-mailShare on TwitterShare on WhatsApp Share on FacebookShare on Twitter Share on LinkedInShare on RedditShare on Google+E-mailShare on TwitterShare on WhatsApp To the skeptic, it may look like a con.  The renewable-energy industry won lucrative U.S. subsidies and immediately snapped into inaction. Advocates had lobbied hard for the revival or extension of wind and solar federal tax credits that came in December. With victory in hand ... very little followed. The industry's windfall hasn't spurred tremendous growth. In some cases, the renewal of the credits actually prompted a sudden slowdown in growth. Without the context, it kinda looks like they won and now they're just sitting on their bums. One notable example is the number of long-term power-purchase agreements (PPAs) signed by corporations. The deals have slowed sharply, leading to a much slower addition of generating capacity this year. In 2015, the wind industry signed more than 2.3 gigawatts of contracts with corporate buyers, in 20 deals. This year through August, it had signed 631 megawatts, in nine deals. Solar, meanwhile, has slowed from 726 megawatts contracted across 11 deals last year to 163 megawatts across three deals, according to 2016 data through August from Bloomberg New Energy Finance. "Many companies that signed those deals in 2015 were afraid that there wouldn't be a tax credit again," said Jacob Susman, vice president and head of origination at EDF Renewable Energy. "That's a big reason why 2015 was so big." So why does 2016 look so small? Incentives can be disincentives With change in the tax credit regime believed to be imminent, developers and corporate clients treated 2015 as a race against time. Developers wanted to lock in long-term contracts so they could finish construction by the end of this year. Companies didn't want to lose a chance to manage their own clean power at the full subsidy level. "There was such a flurry that people may be taking a breather," said Pete Dignan, CEO of Boulder, Colorado-based Renewable Choice Energy. "But there's significant activity ahead." The new long-term subsidy period allows developers and potential corporate buyers to be more thoughtful in their planning and negotiations—to pace themselves. "A whole bunch of folks decided they just didn't have enough time and backed off," said Dignan, who said he had anticipated a slow start to this year. "They've re-started." Dignan said Renewable Choice is talking to several hundred companies looking seriously at corporate PPAs. Power prices are low Companies sign renewable-power purchase agreements partly so they have a sense of what they'll be paying for clean electricity years ahead of time. There's always a risk, though, that market power prices will dip below their contracted level. At the moment, power is relatively inexpensive. Market prices have slid since mid-2014. That makes it much harder for would-be PPA customers to find a better deal.  Executives antsy to boost their U.S. clean-energy portfolios probably did so last year, when the clock on subsidies was thought to be ticking. "Growth will have to come from new entrants or add-on deals from existing players," said Nathan Serota, a solar analyst at Bloomberg New Energy Finance. But they have less incentive at the moment, because "rock-bottom power prices" are making renewable PPAs less attractive today. When prices are low, the market is already giving companies a deal on power, so they hold off on taking advantage of tax credits until prices rise again. ‘Sustainable’ demand is waiting in the wings The top 20 institutions—companies, governments, and universities—are pursuing these deals for reasons not limited to price, so a blip in activity this year may be masking pent demand. At least seven of the top 20 PPA signers this year have committed, on varying time scales, to sourcing 100 percent of their power from renewables: Google, Facebook, Wal-Mart Stores, Mars, Nestle, Steelcase, and Salesforce. Dow Chemical wants 750 MW of renewables by 2025. By 2020 Target wants to raise to 500 the number of its buildings that have rooftop solar power.  And the renewables sector isn't quite a ghost town. Amazon.com Inc. yesterday announced a 253MW facility planned for Texas that will produce enough electricity to power the equivalent of about 90,000 homes. That single play puts it ahead of where Google, which has been at it a while, and Norsk Hydro were at the end of August in this calendar year. In fact, it's the second-largest single U.S. corporate purchase to be announced, according to the American Wind Energy Association. Johnson & Johnson told Bloomberg News this morning it has committed to buying half the output from a 200-megawatt wind project being developed in Texas by EON SE.  The next big wave may be powered by smaller companies. "A lot of companies are looking for a dance partner," said John Carson, CEO of Vancouver, British Columbia-based Alterra Power Corp. "They see the Wal-Marts and the Googles." Does the U.S. even need subsidies?  California solar and Texas wind may represent the most mature markets for renewable power. Wind farms stud the Midwest. Solar panels collect sunlight from the Mid-Atlantic states to New England.  This map shows the distribution of large (larger than 1 MW) wind- and solar-fueled power plants in the U.S. SOURCE: U.S. Energy Information Administration But not every place in the U.S. has jumped on the renewables bandwagon. That makes the federal incentives for corporate buyers a bulwark against apathy or hostility to clean energy in the rest of the country, so there's still plenty of work for subsidies to do. "Will it be 3.4 gigawatts in 2016? Probably not," EDF's Susman said. "Will it be 2 gigawatts or more annually for the foreseeable future? Probably so.'' Hannah Hunt, a research analyst at AWEA, called it "a remarkable period of stability." To meet President Barack Obama's ambitious 2050 climate goal, the U.S. will need all the clean gigawatts it can muster and, probably, new policies to encourage construction. A sustainable energy system can be yours for the low, low price of 1 percent of GDP.  (Updates paragraph below third chart with Johnson and Johnson news.)

After becoming a staple brand for coffee drinkers, Starbucks is trying to reinvent itself as a luxury brand.  (Marcus Oleniuk / Toronto Star) | Order this photo   By Abha BhattaraiThe Washington Post Sat., Sept. 17, 2016 With 24,000 locations across the world, Starbucks has become an everyday stop for millions. But that ubiquity could now be its problem. “Starbucks is now competing with chains like Dunkin’ Donuts and McDonald’s,” Business Insider proclaimed this week. “It has gotten, in a sense, too basic.” “Basic,” according to Urban Dictionary, is a pejorative term used to describe anything “involving obscenely obvious behavior, dress, action.” Other examples of brands deemed basic: Lululemon, Michael Kors and Ugg Australia. So what’s an overexposed company to do? Article Continued Below Starbucks in recent years has begun looking for ways to restore its lustre. In December 2014, it opened a Roastery & Tasting Room in Seattle, where $10 cold brews are the norm. The high-end concept is soon to expand to New York and Shanghai, with nearly a dozen other locations in the works, according to Business Insider: “The premium coffee experience of the Roasteries is intended to have the trickle-down effect. The chain plans to open roughly 500 Reserve stores, which offers premium Roastery beverages and artisanal Princi food, and 1,500 stores with Reserve bars, which will serve drinks made in a wider variety of styles such as pour-over and siphoning.” It’s all part of an effort, analysts say, to reinvent itself as a luxury brand. But can a brand that’s gone mainstream turn high-end again? It’s a quandary that brands like Apple, Michael Kors and Coach have also faced in recent years, as they look to balance widespread popularity with upscale cachet. “I’ll just say this: It’s much harder to go upmarket than it is to do the opposite,” said Milton Pedraza, chief executive of the Luxury Institute, a New York-based market research firm. “What Starbucks has to do at a higher level is to be personal, like when you go to Hermes and the salesperson knows your name, or when you buy a Tesla and you’re in a high-street showroom.” When it was founded in 1971, Starbucks was a premium brand, offering a higher-priced but also better-quality cup of coffee than most Americans were used to. In the decades since, Americans have taken to it in droves, making the Seattle-based brand a staple, as ubiquitous as McDonald’s or Walmart. “They’ve set the bar high, and now they have to keep moving to an even higher level,” Pedraza said. It’s a phenomenon Pam Danzinger calls “lux-flation”: Our ideas of what constitutes a premium product or experience are always evolving. “A brand like Starbucks starts at the top, and as it expands, it becomes the new normal,” said Danzinger, author of Putting the Luxe Back in Luxury. “Now it’s got to create that mystique once again.” Need another example? Just look to Apple, Danzinger says. A decade or two ago, the company’s iMacs and MacBooks were seen as coveted novelty items. Today, just about everybody has at least one Apple device, which, she says, is why the company is reinventing its retail locations with free Wi-Fi, ficus trees and weekend concerts. “They’re putting the human touch back into the equation,” Danzinger said. “That’s one way to regain that luxury edge.” It’s not always an easy proposition, Pedraza says. Coach had tried for years to win back an air of exclusivity to no avail, as have Michael Kors and Kate Spade. But, he says, there have been some successes: In the early ‘90s, Gucci was almost done for. The Italian fashion company was in financial despair and its creative director was quoted as saying “no one would dream of wearing Gucci.” Then, Tom Ford took over and revived the brand, boosting sales and restoring the company to its previous glory. “There are examples, but it takes a lot of money and a lot of paring back,” Pedraza said. “And frankly, not every company has the courage to do that. Everything is so grow, grow, grow in today’s world. And before you know it, you have a mainstream brand that isn’t special anymore.” Read more about: Starbucks The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.

Almond users can now get smarter with the addition of WiFi presence sensors, local controls, and one-touch controls for screen settings. Logo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151211/295384LOGO "The average consumer is often intimidated by routers, the technology and the setup process so we wanted to provide a product that would be beautifully designed and simple to use," said Rammohan Malasani, CEO, Securifi. "With intuitive, easy to use interface, Almond makes it simple for users to integrate all of their connected devices." Key upgraded capabilities include: WiFi Triggers. Because smartphones connect to Almond via WiFi, the presence of a phone on the network can automatically trigger a set of actions. For example, when an Almond user returns home, and their phone connects to their WiFi network, Almond can change settings, unlock doors, or raise the temperature. Nest Integration. The Almond can now control the Nest Thermostat and Nest Protect, with the ability to broker between two smartphone controllers. For example, if one person has the thermostat set to 65 and the other has it set to 70, the thermostat will settle at 68 when both phones are present. Local Control for Better Privacy and Cloud-Free Access. Almond is the only home automation hub that doesn't require an internet connection. Users can control smart home devices even when the internet is down, and home device data is not shared with the cloud, ensuring a higher level of privacy. Scenes for One-Touch Control. Almond enables users to create a "scene" or series of simultaneous actions that can all take place with one tap of a button. For example, users can turn off the lights, set the alarm and lock the doors with a single touch before going to bed. Almond users can control all their smart home devices such as front doors, garage doors, entry/motion sensors, temperature/humidity controls, and appliances, turning the humble wireless router into a universal, user friendly home automation hub. Almond routers are available for purchase at Securifi.com and at leading retailers including Amazon, Costco, Best Buy, Walmart, Office Depot, QVC and more.

Police said that Pottsville officers, with the assistance of New York City police, took Peter E. Fulton, 21, of Pottsville, into custody and transported him back to Schuylkill County. He was arraigned by on-call Magisterial District Judge David A. Plachko, Port Carbon, on charges of felony arson, recklessly endangering another person, risking a catastrophe and criminal mischief. Fulton was then committed to Schuylkill County Prison, unable to post $150,000 straight cash bail. Police said Fulton started a fire that damaged a home at 315 Morgan Ave. about 11 p.m. by lighting a mattress on fire. The man then fled to New York. He was receiving treatment at a facility there at the time he was identified as the person responsible for the fire. On Aug. 25, police said, they obtained an arrest warrant for Fulton and planned to take him into custody upon his release from the treatment facility. Fulton will now have to answer to the charges at a preliminary hearing before Magisterial District Judge James K. Reiley, Pottsville. No injuries were reported by first responders and the house is salvageable, police said. Tremont man faces drug charge TREMONT — Tremont police charged a borough man in connection with an incident about 3:20 p.m. Sept. 10 at 57 Spring St. Police said Blake E. Seigrist, 19, of 204 W.

If passed, it will raise funds dedicated to education, health care and senior services by increasing the minimum tax on corporations with more than $25 million in annual Oregon sales. Estimates of the new revenue range from $2 billion to $3 billion every year, so the stakes are high for Oregon residents and for the affected corporations. To date, supporters have raised $1.5 million for the campaign, opponents almost $8 million. I’ve already invested time, energy, and money in Measure 97. My motive is simple — I’m committed to the public good, and the public good in Oregon has been compromised by an unbalanced and inadequately productive tax structure. But my purpose in this column and its two sequels isn’t to persuade you to vote for Measure 97. You probably will anyway, because you too are devoted to the public good. My purpose is educational. The issue involves several complexities, and I want to help you sort them out before we get barraged with competing claims. I hope you’ll then use the information to help others who may be undecided because they’re confused. I’ll start with the main players. Both sides are stressing who stands to win or lose. So one framing narrative is that it’s big corporations vs. public sector unions. There’s truth in that framing — almost all the campaign money is coming from those sources. But truth won’t be served if we take that to mean it’s a contest between competing self-interests, not between private interests and the public good. The new tax would be levied on about 1,000 corporations, the large majority of which (e.g. Walmart, Shell Oil, Home Depot) are headquartered out of state. By opposing Measure 97, management of these corporations are protecting their profits. Of course they’re using arguments suggesting less self-interested motives, but make no mistake: They’re working for their shareholders. The main promoter of Measure 97 has been the Oregon Education Association, our public teachers’ union. Its most important allies have been two other unions representing public employees — SEIU and AFSCME. Whose interests are they advancing? Doubtless, passage will make raises more likely, though the unions must negotiate wages and benefits with each agency and school district. But the new funds will expand and improve public services in many ways. Take education. For 25 years Oregon has been disinvesting in its public schools. Here are some of the results: In 2014-2015 Oregon had the third largest class sizes in the country. In 2014-2015, Oregon students averaged 169.9 days in the classroom. Most states require a minimum 180 days per school year. Oregon once had more than 1,200 career and technical education programs. Now there are fewer than 700. In 2013-14 the National Center for Education Statistics ranked Oregon’s graduation rate fourth lowest in the U.S. Education Week ranked Oregon 35th in school funding, with a D+ grade. One more example: A 2014 U.S. Justice Dept. report faulted Oregon for woefully inadequate community mental health services. It’s to correct deficiencies like these that public employees are seeking more state revenue. Next week I’ll explain what taxes corporations now pay in Oregon. In the following I’ll examine the claim that consumers, not large corporations, will foot the bill for Measure 97. — Herb Rothschild's column appears in the Tidings every Saturday.   About Us Sign up for daily e-mail Subscribe Reader Services Reader Services Subscriptions Subscriber controls Contact us Submissions Photos Events Letters to the editor Corrections Alerts Email alerts RSS feeds Text Alerts Advertise Media Kit Home Products and services Ad rates Advertising contacts Propel Marketing © Copyright 2006-2016 GateHouse Media, LLC.

So where’s the party? By ERIC ROSTON AND BRIAN ECKHOUSE Bloomberg News First Published Sep 17 2016 01:05AM    •    Last Updated Sep 17 2016 01:05 am Single page Share This Article To the skeptic, it may look like a con. The renewable-energy industry won lucrative U.S. subsidies and immediately snapped into inaction. Advocates had lobbied hard for the revival or extension of wind and solar federal tax credits that came in December. With victory in hand . . . very little followed. The industry's windfall hasn't spurred tremendous growth. In some cases, the renewal of the credits actually prompted a sudden slowdown in growth. Without the context, it kind of looks like they won and now they're just sitting on their bums. One notable example is the number of long-term power-purchase agreements (PPAs) signed by corporations. The deals have slowed sharply, leading to a much slower addition of generating capacity this year. VIDEOS TOP JOBS In 2015, the wind industry signed more than 2.3 gigawatts of contracts with corporate buyers, in 20 deals. This year through August, it had signed 631 megawatts, in nine deals. Solar, meanwhile, has slowed from 726 megawatts contracted across 11 deals last year to 163 megawatts across three deals, according to 2016 data through August from Bloomberg New Energy Finance. "Many companies that signed those deals in 2015 were afraid that there wouldn't be a tax credit again," said Jacob Susman, vice president and head of origination at EDF Renewable Energy. "That's a big reason why 2015 was so big." So why does 2016 look so small? With change in the tax credit regime believed to be imminent, developers and corporate clients treated 2015 as a race against time. Developers wanted to lock in long-term contracts so they could finish construction by the end of this year. Companies didn't want to lose a chance to manage their own clean power at the full subsidy level. "There was such a flurry that people may be taking a breather," said Pete Dignan, CEO of Boulder, Colorado-based Renewable Choice Energy. "But there's significant activity ahead." The new long-term subsidy period allows developers and potential corporate buyers to be more thoughtful in their planning and negotiations - to pace themselves. "A whole bunch of folks decided they just didn't have enough time and backed off," said Dignan, who said he had anticipated a slow start to this year. "They've re-started." Dignan said Renewable Choice is talking to several hundred companies looking seriously at corporate PPAs. Companies sign renewable-power purchase agreements partly so they have a sense of what they'll be paying for clean electricity years ahead of time. There's always a risk, though, that market power prices will dip below their contracted level. At the moment, power is relatively inexpensive. Market prices have slid since mid-2014. That makes it much harder for would-be PPA customers to find a better deal. Executives antsy to boost their U.S. clean-energy portfolios probably did so last year, when the clock on subsidies was thought to be ticking. "Growth will have to come from new entrants or add-on deals from existing players," said Nathan Serota, a solar analyst at Bloomberg New Energy Finance. But they have less incentive at the moment, because "rock-bottom power prices" are making renewable PPAs less attractive today. When prices are low, the market is already giving companies a deal on power, so they hold off on taking advantage of tax credits until prices rise again. The top 20 institutions - companies, governments, and universities - are pursuing these deals for reasons not limited to price, so a blip in activity this year may be masking pent demand. At least seven of the top 20 PPA signers this year have committed, on varying time scales, to sourcing 100 percent of their power from renewables: Google, Facebook, Wal-Mart Stores, Mars, Nestle, Steelcase, and Salesforce. Dow Chemical wants 750 MW of renewables by 2025. By 2020 Target wants to raise to 500 the number of its buildings that have rooftop solar power. And the renewables sector isn't quite a ghost town. Amazon.com this week announced a 253MW facility planned for Texas that will produce enough electricity to power the equivalent of about 90,000 homes. That single play puts it ahead of where Google, which has been at it a while, and Norsk Hydro were at the end of August in this calendar year. In fact, it's the second-largest single U.S. corporate purchase to be announced, according to the American Wind Energy Association. The next big wave may be powered by smaller companies. "A lot of companies are looking for a dance partner," said John Carson, CEO of Vancouver, British Columbia-based Alterra Power Corp. "They see the Wal-Marts and the Googles." » Next page...
