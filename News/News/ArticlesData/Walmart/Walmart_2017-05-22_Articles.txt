Police say Scott Sargent opened fire in a side parking lot outside the store. Scott Sargent WILKES-BARRE — The trial of Scott Sargent, who police allege opened fire in a Wal-Mart parking lot, was delayed when his attorney raised questions about his competency as jury selection was set to begin Monday morning. Sargent, 32, of Shenandoah, is facing trial on 25 counts, including attempted murder and assaulting police, in the October 2015 shooting at the Wilkes-Barre Township Marketplace on Highland Park Boulevard that horrified Saturday shoppers. After opening fire outside the crowded Wal-Mart store, Sargent got into a firefight with police — firing a shot through the windshield of a police SUV that narrowly missed a Wilkes-Barre Township police officer, according to prosecutors. The gun battle that unfolded between Wal-Mart and Chuck E. Cheese came to an end after Wilkes-Barre City police officer Alan Gribble blasted Sargent in the abdomen with a shotgun, prosecutors said. Jury selection had been set to begin Monday morning, but Sargent’s court-appointed attorney, Joseph J. Yeager, filed a petition seeking a competency hearing before it began. “It is believed that the defendant has a severe mental health diagnoses and as such is not competent to stand trial at this time,” Yeager wrote. The attorney says Kingston psychiatrist Dr. Richard Fischbein examined Sargent earlier this month and concluded he was incompetent to stand trial. The filing says the defense is prepared to turn over its information to prosecutors in advance of a competency hearing. Assistant District Attorney Jarrett Ferentino said he was prepared to start his case Monday and that it was “disheartening” to have to explain to the law enforcement officers targeted in the shooting that the case has been further delayed. “I’ll get this individual evaluated as soon as possible by my own expert,” Ferentino said, noting he has been inquiring about a competency evaluation for the past year, yet only learned last week it would be an issue. “This is a very serious case, as you know, and we’re just kicking it down the street,” he said. Luzerne County Judge David W. Lupas said the timing was “unfortunate” but that a hearing would be required because Sargent’s competency has been questioned. He ordered the defense to turn over all its records by the end of the week and said a hearing would be set for a later date. During his argument, Ferentino noted that Sargent, who is now seeking to be deemed incompetent to stand trial, has personally written a number of “articulate filings” to the court. Among them was a motion in February seeking Yeager’s removal for what Sargent characterized as an “irreconcilable personality conflict.” Sargent maintained he has received no discovery information, nor discussed any possible defenses with Yeager. In that instance, Lupas instructed Yeager to talk to Sargent about his concerns. Sargent has also sued Luzerne County officials over allegations that staff at the jail failed to properly care for his “medical condition.” The hand-written complaint alleges jail employees failed to return him to the hospital “after multiple complaints of agonizing pain and observing (me) falling to the floor inside (my) cell curling up in excrusiating [sic] pain which was eventually diagnosed at the hospital as life threatening.” Contact the writer:   570-821-2058, @cvjimhalpin We welcome user discussion on our site, under the following guidelines: To comment you must first create a profile and sign-in with a verified DISQUS account or social network ID.

Nick Stockton Science Date of Publication: 05.22.17. 05.22.17 Time of Publication: 11:00 am. 11:00 am A Curious Plan to Save the Environment With the Blockchain Getty Images Magic internet money—also known as cryptocurrency—is at an all-time high. The experts who watch this stuff predict that one bitcoin (the most famous cryptocurrency) will soon be worth $2,000. The big selling point of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin is their use of something called the blockchain to make any transaction mossstly trustworthy. In a cryptocash economy, the blockchain renders treasuries, banks, credit cards, and other financial organs vestigial. Enthusiasts believe these decentralized, cryptographically sealed databases could starve inefficient middlemen from virtually any system. And today in Nature, conservation biologist Guillaume Chapron argues that blockchains can even save the planet. Basically, all a blockchain does is assign any piece of information a unique signature. If someone alters that information, that unique code no longer works, and you know something fishy is afoot. In bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, the whole community then reviews every attempted transaction to ensure each is unique—preventing shenanigans like spending the same money twice. But it can come in handy elsewhere. Walmart recently launched a trial using a blockchain to fight food poisoning and waste by tracking food from supplier to shelf. Say a salmonella outbreak hits Sioux City, Iowa. Walmart’s supply chain blockchain would let it irrefutably trace the tainted product back to a spinach farm in Salinas, California. “One reason why we have environmental crises, like the overexploitation of natural resources, and pollution, is because the global economy is full of actors who are doing business without much accountability,” says Chapron. “When you go buy something, you have no idea where it comes from, how it’s made. There are so many intermediaries, and it’s very easy to cheat.” Cheating, in this case, means more than companies lying about where they dump their garbage. And actors can be anyone, including nation-states. Related Stories Damian Carrington The Arctic Doomsday Seed Vault Flooded. Thanks, Global Warming Nick Stockton How Boring Old Pension Funds Might Curb Global Warming Cade Metz A Plan to Save Blockchain Democracy From Bitcoin’s Civil War Chapron mentions land ownership. Many countries promise land to indigenous peoples, only to renege once they discover the land is, say, sitting on top of sweet, light crude oil. “Governments have been known to make up completely new land registries and say, ‘Hey, this land is ours and nobody lives here,'” he says. Such double dealing wouldn’t be possible if the country placed its land registry in a blockchain. Some countries already do this. Transparency also improves under the blockchain model, Chapron says. Many sustainably sourced goods come from small communities vulnerable to graft and exploitation by middlemen. Using something akin to Walmart’s food safety program, a blockchain could ensure that a grouper being tossed through Tokyo’s Tsukiji Market actually came from a sustainable fisherman in Indonesia. The blockchain, Chapron argues, can also enable financial incentives to help the environment. With blockchain banking, for example, farmers in Kenya could get quick, corruption-free insurance payouts whenever an endangered elephant tromps through their fields. And the blockchain could discourage corporations and governments from backpedaling on their environmental promises or misreporting their progress. Even the increased efficiency of something like Walmart’s blockchain program can benefit the environment. Brigid McDermott is VP of blockchain business development at IBM, and she helped Walmart develop the program. “I spent about a three month period telling the press, ‘Look, blockchains aren’t magic, it can’t do everything, it’s not like we’re out here solving world hunger,'” she says. “But then I thought, ‘Wait, solving world hunger is exactly what we’re doing.'” She points out that about one-third of all food is wasted. A lot of this waste occurs because food is improperly handled, shipped, or stored somewhere in the supply chain and spoils. Eliminating spoilage saves resources. Now, this alone won’t solve world hunger. And like McDermott said, blockchains aren’t magic: You can’t encrypt a fish in Indonesia and expect it to pop out, sustainably caught, plump and shiny-eyed, in Tokyo. Making this work means getting people to adopt it. And that requires more than just beaming reliable internet across the developing world. “If you are going to use this technology to provide money to people in Africa, or grant land titles to Brazilian tribes, you can’t just ignore the fact of how easy it is for people to lose their private keys,” says Steve Wilson, the vice president of Constellation Research, who specializes in online privacy. Blockchain transactions are theoretically secure, but that security relies on people keeping track of their personalized string of characters. Even in the developed world, stories exist of people having their private keys phished away by hackers. Oh: And many governments and corporations probably aren’t eager to surrender their authority to computer code. Middlemen, either. “Just because the blockchain is safe doesn’t mean its users will be,” says Steve Wilson, the vice president of Constellation Research, who specializes in online privacy. The same forensic techniques the FBI used to root out Silk Road magnate—and prolific bitcoin user—Ross Ulbrecht could easily be employed by less scrupulous agents against indigenous farmers. Finally, Bitcoin, and other cryptocurrencies, are incredibly volatile. “This paper says it would be cool to pay people in the developing world in cryptocurrency, but there’s no promise any of these currencies will even exist in two years,” says Wilson. Chapron believes basic market capitalism will solve these, and other, problems. Transactions—whether financial or otherwise—gravitate towards trust. And blockchains force trust on their users. Further, any untrustworthy users will be unsuccessful in a blockchain system. The revolution, says Chapron, is inevitable. “It will be like when Gutenberg made the printing press, and suddenly anybody could make texts and distribute them to people,” he says. “The Catholic Church tried to stop it, but the presses spread so fast and so far that they were eventually powerless.” Blockchains aren’t magic, but maybe they can perform miracles.

Shares of Wal-Mart's stock were climbing around 1 percent during premarket trading following this news. "We delivered a solid first quarter and we're encouraged by the start to the year," Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon said in a statement. "We're moving faster to combine our digital and physical assets to make shopping simple and easy for customers. Our plan is gaining traction." Related: You Probably Shopped at Walmart Last Year On Wednesday, big-box retail rival Target reported earnings, sales and comparable sales that topped Street expectations. Target is in the midst of a multiyear turnaround effort, as it attempts to compete with Wal-Mart's "Everyday Low Price" strategy and Amazon's encroaching presence over the industry. "While [Target] is not trying to directly undercut Walmart on prices, it is trying to use everyday lower prices on daily use items to drive customers into remodeled stores that provide a better experience than Walmart," wrote Stifel analyst Mark Astrachan in a note to clients prior to Thursday's earnings announcement. As of Wednesday's close, shares of Wal-Mart have climbed nearly 19 percent over the past 12 months and are up about 9 percent for the year-to-date period.

Target has gone four full quarters slipping in a variety of metrics from profits, stock prices, and even perception of its brand name. But a new survey by investment bank Cowen has also found that customer satisfaction has also tumbled. The survey of 2,500 Target customers shows declines across the board, including customer service, merchandise selection, and overall quality. According to the survey, Target’s satisfaction level has fallen 383 points to 66.7 percent, MSN Money reported. As MSN ruefully noted, “It appears unhappy Target shoppers could be taking their business elsewhere.” Meanwhile, the company’s fortunes continue to decline. On Wednesday, the discount retailer reported first quarter same-store sales fell 1.3%. While that was better than analyst estimates for a 3.6% drop, it marked the fourth straight quarterly decline in the key retail measure. Walmart’s U.S. business, on the other hand, saw same-store sales gain 1.4% in the first quarter on the back of efforts to slash food prices and bolster customer service Cowen analyst Oliver Chen stated that “Target as the retailer is likely losing share on everyday essentials, as customers turn to Amazon, Walmart, and other places.” While insisting that things are turning around for his company, Target CEO Brian Cornell admitted, “We aren’t doing any high fives in the [board] room.” The CEO is also finding consequences from the company’s fall. This month it was reported that the retailer slashed its CEO’s pay by at least one-third. Cornell is not the only high-ranking officer at Target to feel the pain. As the company works to revamp itself in the face of its ongoing troubles, several top executives have been fired or have otherwise moved on from the retailer. Other signs of the retailer’s troubles came in February when it abruptly dumped several projects aimed at revitalizing the company’s brand. At the time, Target shuttered two high-priority projects which were intended to guarantee the company’s future just under a year after a public boycott provoked by the company’s insistence on transgender-friendly, mixed-sex dressing rooms. The company’s stock prices have fallen steadily since the company announced its transgender bathroom policy last year. By March of this year, many investment advisers had downgraded Target to a “strong sell” even as its falling price might seem to make it an attractive buy. Even as it was shuttering these projects, the company’s stock price hit $64.77 at market close on Feb. 8. That was down from $83 when the boycott began to when the company made its transgender policy on April 19 of last year. And the company’s stock has continued to fall, with a May 19 close of just under $56, which is slightly higher than its 52-week low of $56.44. But it is a far cry from its high of $84.14 seen last year. Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston, or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com.

The heirs of Wal-Mart Stores founders Helen and Sam Walton, continue the philanthropy that was instilled in them years ago, according to Carrie Walton Penner, grand-daughter of the Waltons and the foundation’s board chairwoman. Arkansas benefited greatly from the family’s benevolence as one of the four areas of giving involving the home region of Northwest Arkansas and the Arkansas Delta raked in $48.6 million in funding last year. Northwest Arkansas received $41.5 million in funding last year under the “home region” umbrella, compared with $29.8 million in 2015. The Arkansas Delta home region giving focuses on improving education and economic activity. That area received $6.5 million last year, compared to $3.5 million in the prior year. In the Delta, the foundation is engaging young people and promoting long-term economic growth. After-school programming continues to expand, including a new Boys & Girls Club facility in Phillips County. To spur lasting economic opportunity, the foundation and other partners also invested in the restoration of a short-line railroad in Helena, Ark,. The project created or maintained more than 60 jobs, with 30 more expected in 2017, the report states. Education, another key area of focus for the foundation, comprised the largest percentage of the funds given at $190.9 million, or 42% of the total given in 2016. “Education funding” distributed across Arkansas totaled $600,000, down from $2 million in the prior year. Another $83.2 million was spent to support projects and entities aimed at protecting the environment across the country. The largest benefactor was the Environmental Defense Fund that has offices in Bentonville and works with Wal-Mart Stores on its sustainability platform. EDF received $13,163,592 last year from the Foundation. Walton Family Foundation also handed out more than $132.69 million in grants dubbed “special projects.” These funds were one-time gifts based on grant applications made by the benefactors. There were roughly 174 special project grants awarded to organizations around the Natural State last year. The total of funds received is more than $36 million. University of the Ozarks in Clarksville was the biggest beneficiary of special project funds last year valued at $10.166 million. Other large benefactors around the state include: • Camp War Eagle: $5.969 million • Arkansas Tech University/Foundation: $3.701 million • ASU Foundation for New American College: $4.642 million • Arkansas Children’s Hospital Foundation: $3.027 million • Benton County: $2.402 million • University of Arkansas: $2.284 million • University of Arkansas Foundation: $1.709 million • Academics Plus Charter School (Maumelle): $1 million • Bentonville /Bella Vista Trail Blazers: $616,472 • City of Springdale: $553,361 • Single Parent Scholarship Fund NWA: $505,000 • City of Bentonville: $333,477 • Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art: $209,970 • Montessori School of NWA: $150,000 • NWA Independent School: $132,000 • Arkansas Arts Center Foundation: $106,000 • Bentonville Child and Development Center: $100,000 • Ozark Montessori Academy: $100,000 There were a dozens of smaller gifts ranging from $5,000 and up to organizations around the state. The Mercy Hospital Foundation of Northwest Arkansas received $70,000, Ozark Natural Science Center received $73.322, Siloam Springs Public Schools got 80,000, the United Way of Northwest Arkansas and Fort Smith received $85,000 and $20,000, respectively. Park Partners of Fort Smith also received $20,000. Boy Scouts of West Arkansas was awarded $50,000 as was the Bentonville Film Festival. The Little Rock Chamber Foundation received $20,000. Philander Smith College received $5,000 and Northwest Arkansas Community College got $11,000. St. Edward’s Mercy Foundation in Fort Smith received $25,000. The complete list of grantees can be found online. The Walton Family Foundation is approaching its 30th birthday and there are three generations of Waltons involved in the management and giving of this benevolent fund. Board Chair Carrie Walton Penner, wife of Wal-Mart Stores Board Chairman Greg Penner, said the family’s engagement is stronger and more strategic than ever. Carrie Walton Penner, chairman of the Walton Family Foundation, and Kyle Peterson, executive director “We have restructured how the foundation is governed to act more urgently and effectively. Up to February 2016, we had open engagement by all family members. We had a board made up of 18 individuals, all family members. Now we have five family members on the board – my aunt Alice; my brother Ben; my father Rob; my cousin Steuart; and myself. Other family members serve the foundation through membership on committees. The change has helped us focus our work. At the same time, it has allowed a full range of family members to be engaged in their specific areas of interest. We needed to figure out a way to be more efficient and effective while maintaining that strong family involvement,” Penner said. When asked why family engagement is important to the foundation, Penner said it’s what her grandparents wanted. “They wanted the foundation to bring us together, to work together, to be active in giving back to our local community, our national community and internationally. Looking to the future, they also wanted to make sure the foundation was open enough to adapt as time goes on and as family members brought new interests to our philanthropic work,” she said. Penner also said the direction and focus of the foundation’s giving is based on working on the biggest challenges that impact quality of life and environment, with K-12 education being a big part of the agenda. “We looked at it in the context of identifying the big social problems that needed to be addressed: How do you improve education for the kids most in need, the children who are being underserved? That’s also the approach we take with the environmental issues we work on, such as freshwater and fisheries. What are the big issues that need to be addressed? Because we are a family philanthropy, we can approach these issues in a very creative way that can complement work being done by those that have already been thinking about it, like a government or a school district. We want to be innovative. Sometimes we can think a little bit more out of the box than a larger institution,” she said. Executive Director Kyle Peterson said despite the foundation’s age and size it still feels very entrepreneurial. “The idea of the moment in philanthropy is around ‘reaching scale.’ Foundations used to think more in terms of just finding great organizations to invest in. The new idea is to look at big issues at the systems level and at scale. It is a fantastic development, but it is also very hard to do. This family is doing that. This foundation feels very comfortable taking on those big issues,” he said. Peterson said the foundation has set ambitious five-year strategies and will focus on the various programs all working together and sharing and learning. Over the past four years the Walton Family Foundation staff has nearly doubled in size to nearly 100. The foundation’s main offices are in Bentonville, but it also has staffed offices in Denver, Jersey City, N.J., and Washington D.C. “If we are truly focused on change at a systems level – whether it’s the Colorado River, the Mississippi River or an entire city – then collaboration is critical. It requires working with other funders and other partners,” he added. Penner said philanthropy is vital to creating change in the world because the foundation can take risks that public and private sectors can’t. “Our foundation is more effective in tackling large-scale challenges than ever. We have a great team of professionals in place. We have dedicated grantees. We have a really strong feedback loop within the family to make sure we get the best ideas on how to give back and to ensure ongoing and lasting engagement. In fact, the fourth generation is starting to get involved. The whole family is proud of that, and I think that is exactly what my grandparents envisioned,” she said.

Investigator A.J. Gambino, with the Hancock County Sheriff’s Department, said deputies first thought they were looking for two women. After interviewing witnesses, it appears the suspects are men dressed in women’s clothing. Gambino said the investigation started last Wednesday, May 17, after a Kiln woman reported her credit card and a gun was stolen from her vehicle overnight, and she received emails from her credit card company warning of possible fraudulent activity at two area Walmart stores. The woman’s card was used at stores in Waveland and Picayune. Gambino said, what appeared to be a black woman was caught on camera at the Waveland Walmart using the stolen card to purchase gift cards at a self-checkout register. While investigating the incident at the Waveland Walmart, Gambino said a second auto burglary was reported in Waveland. Like the first burglary, the victim received emails from their credit card company warning of possible fraudulent activity at the Waveland Walmart. The same suspect was caught on surveillance video purchasing gift cards with the credit card stolen from the second burglary. Gambino said later that morning, two suspects returned to the Waveland Walmart, placed jewelry in a layaway account, and then used the fraudulently purchased gift cards to purchase the jewelry out of layaway. The Walmart associate present when the suspects purchased the jewelry described them as black men “dressed in drag,” Gambino said. According to Gambino, the suspects tried to return the jewelry for cash at Walmart stores in Pass Christian and Lafayette, LA. Gambino said the suspects searched the area looking for easy targets, such as unlocked cars, and used the stolen credit cards to load gift cards immediately after stealing them. Investigators believe the suspects are traveling in a silver car, make and model unknown. The suspects are wanted on charges of burglary and credit card fraud. If you have any information that could help investigators solve this case, please call the sheriff’s department at 228-466-6900 or dispatch at 228-255-9191. The Waveland Police Department is working with the sheriff’s department on the case. Copyright 2017 WLOX. All rights reserved.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Here's What Drove Wal-Mart's Explosive Online Growth The brick-and-mortar retail behemoth managed incredible online sales growth during the first quarter thanks to its newfound aggressiveness. Timothy Green (TMFBargainBin) May 22, 2017 at 2:00PM In a retail environment that's causing trouble for many of its smaller competitors, Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) is shining. The company extended its long streak of comparable sales growth in the U.S. during the first quarter, and it managed to grow earnings per share despite making significant investments in its business. The big surprise in Wal-Mart's first-quarter report was e-commerce. Online sales in the U.S soared 63% year over year, more than double the 29% growth the company managed during the fourth quarter, and more than quadruple the rate that Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) grew product sales during the first quarter. Amazon is still far ahead in e-commerce, but that won't be true for long if Wal-Mart can maintain its momentum. How did Wal-Mart do it? There were two main drivers behind the company's explosive first-quarter e-commerce growth. Image source: Wal-Mart. 1. Acquisitions Wal-Mart closed on the $3.3 billion acquisition of Jet.com in September of last year, so e-commerce growth was in part driven by revenue from the new addition. Jet was reportedly on pace to generate around $500 million of revenue over the next year at the time of the acquisition. Wal-Mart doesn't disclose the size of its U.S. e-commerce business, but third-party estimates put it at $13.7 billion in 2015. Jet.com founder Marc Lore was placed in charge of Wal-Mart's entire e-commerce businesses, and he's made a few more acquisitions in recent months. Wal-Mart acquired Shoebuy, Modcloth, and Moosejaw earlier this year, and it's reportedly in talks to acquire clothing start-up Bonobos. Wal-Mart doesn't plan to go crazy with acquisitions. According to CEO Doug McMillon, the recent acquisitions were meant to improve Wal-Mart's assortment and give it expertise in higher-margin categories like shoes and apparel. McMillon drove that point home in the conference call: "The acquisitions have received a lot of attention but our plan in e-commerce is not to buy our way to success." Wal-Mart is focused on growing the e-commerce businesses organically, and that's what drove most of e-commerce growth during the first quarter. 2. Aggressive e-commerce initiatives Wal-Mart stated in its earnings press release that the majority of its e-commerce growth came from organic growth through Walmart.com. This was driven by a few different initiatives. First, Wal-Mart has been increasing the number of products available on its website in an effort to catch up with Amazon. Walmart.com had 50 million different items available at the end of the first quarter, up from just 10 million one year ago. That's still far behind the hundreds of millions of items sold by Amazon, but the gap is closing. Second, Wal-Mart introduced free two-day shipping on orders of $35 or more during the first quarter. This aggressive move prompted Amazon to slash the minimum on its own non-Prime free shipping offer twice, and it made Amazon's $99 annual Prime membership less attractive for those who care only about its free shipping benefits. Wal-Mart also introduced pick-up discounts to customers who order certain items online and choose to pick up their order in a store. Wal-Mart is far more efficient shipping products to its stores than it is shipping individual orders to customers, allowing it to provide a sometimes-sizable discount for in-store pick-up. According to the company, 90% of the U.S. population is within 10 miles of a Wal-Mart store. Beyond standard online sales, Wal-Mart has continued to expand its online grocery service, which allows customers to place a grocery order online and pick it up curbside at a Wal-Mart location for free. The service is now available at 670 locations in the U.S., and Wal-Mart plans to grow that number in 2017 while expanding to other countries. Online grocery sales are included in Wal-Mart's e-commerce sales figures. Wal-Mart has finally cracked the e-commerce code Amazon has had incredible success with its Prime membership program, offering unlimited two-day shipping, a growing catalog of streaming video, and plenty of other perks. The only way Wal-Mart can succeed online is to do what it's been doing since it was founded: offer the absolute lowest prices. But low prices alone aren't enough. The free two-day shipping offer is critical to get customers to even consider shopping on Walmart.com, especially those used to shopping on Amazon by default. Based on Wal-Mart's first-quarter results, free two-day shipping is doing exactly that. Wal-Mart remains a distant second behind Amazon in the race for online sales. But the company is making big strides, and if it can maintain anything close to its explosive growth rate during the first quarter, that gap will quickly shrink. Amazon certainly has something to worry about. Timothy Green has no position in any stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Amazon. The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy.

A lot of successful orders got cancelled afterwards as Walmart sold more than they had available. It is a head-scratcher why Walmart's shopping platform is not able to keep sales and stock in sync. At this point no online retailer is selling the $299.99 Nintendo Switch consoles. The Nintendo Switch will continue to be hard to find for the foreseeable future. Nintendo plans to ship 10 million consoles world-wide in the time from April 2017 to April 2018. From the launch on Mach 3 to April 27, the Mario company sold 2.74 million Switch consoles. Online stores restocked the $299.99 Nintendo Switch with Gray Joy-Con and the $299.99 Nintendo Switch with Neon Joy-Con in time for the launch of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe on April 28. Since then the Switch console was out of stock online, besides the TRU bundle offer, according to data from The Tracker. The Nintendo Switch reseller markups keep steady and range today between $93 to $110 for the Nintendo Switch with Gray Joy-Con and $100 to $130 for the Nintendo Switch with Neon Joy-Con on amazon.com. The Nintendo Switch with Neon Joy-Con is more rare than the console with Gray controllers, resulting in considerable higher market value. Overall the Nintendo Switch market prices have risen slightly. To find Nintendo Switch in stock online, shoppers can use our new The Tracker app, available as free download for iOS and Android.  There are also several new accessories coming on the market from Nintendo in the next weeks. See the full list of new Nintendo Switch accessories. When is Nintendo Switch in stock online again? Nintendo is ramping up the production for the Nintendo Switch, but has not disclosed what the current production capacity per month is. The demand for the Nintendo Switch will spike during the Holiday Shopping season 2017. Nintendo will set aside a large part of the Switch production during the next months for November and December. This stock piling will keep the Nintendo Switch in short supply during the next 5 months. As Nintendo coordinated new Switch console shipment with the launch of Mario Kart 8, we expect the company to do the same for the next major Switch game launches. This means the next big wave of new Switch consoles comes in mid-June for the release of ARMS. The Nintendo Switch will likely be offered in special bundles in time for the Holidays. A Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Switch bundle has already surfaced in Russia. Because of the incredible demand for the Switch console, the monetary savings on these bundles will be limited. Usually bundles offer a way for consumers to get a free game. Nintendo can afford to just offer some savings, unless the demand is slowing down. Read the latest Nintendo Switch news. How to find a Nintendo Switch in Stock Online We developed the The Tracker app to make finding stock of rare products online as easy and stress free as possible. Download the free app for Apple iPhone or Android phones. From the list products you select to be notified for the Switch with Grey Joy-Con and/or Neon Joy-Con. That is it. It is set and forget.

Nintendo Switch in Stock at Stores Best Buy stores had the Nintendo Switch in stock this morning. We prepared our readers for this Switch event before it was official. The Nintendo Switch is also available in 833 Walmart stores, 843 Target stores, 24 GameStop locations according to the Nintendo Switch inventory tracker iStockNow (9:30am ET). The number of Target stores increased by over 600 compared to Sunday. Target appears to have received a major shipment of Nintendo Switch consoles Monday morning.  The Nintendo flagship store in New York said on April 28 in a tweet to have the Nintendo Switch in stock each morning. People in New York or visitors can give this purchase option a try. Social media posts from people who visited the flagship store confirm the availability of the Switch at the Nintendo store in New York. Some even report that they saw the Switch still on the shelves late afternoon.  This week two new Switch games are released. The big upcoming Switch games are Arms on June 16 and Splatoon 2 on July 21. Amazon offers pre-order discounts on both of the titles for Prime members to the tune of 20%.

Yuriko Nakao Bloomberg The Florida Legislature narrowly approved a bill that would allow distilled spirits to be sold in grocery stores. Now it’s up to the governor to sign the bill, veto it or let it become law without his signature. Yuriko Nakao Bloomberg Business May 22, 2017 12:53 PM Should booze be sold with groceries? ‘Liquor wall’ decision due soon By Jim Turner News Service of Florida LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story TALLAHASSEE Opponents have mobilized to try to convince Gov. Rick Scott to veto a bill that would a repeal a decades-old law requiring hard spirits to be sold in separate facilities from groceries and other goods — an issue that has become known as the “liquor wall.” But Scott, who faces a Wednesday deadline to decide whether to sign, veto or let the measure become law without his signature, hasn’t indicated what he’ll do with the proposal (SB 106), backed by retailers such as Target and Walmart. Members of the Florida Independent Spirits Association, which, along with Publix Super Markets and ABC Fine Wine & Spirits, opposed the repeal, have stepped up the pro-veto movement since the House narrowly signed off of the measure — in a 58-57 vote — on April 26. Publix opposes the ‘liquor wall’ bill. Miami Herald file photo Meanwhile, Floridians For Fair Business Practices, which includes Walmart and Target, has urged to urge Scott to sign the bill. The governor’s office as of Friday had received 2,674 emails, 570 letters and 235 calls in opposition to the bill since lawmakers gave approval, according to Scott spokeswoman Lauren Schenone. Another 3,245 names were submitted via petitions collected at independent liquor stores. The governor’s office during the same period had also received 434 phone calls, 320 emails and seven letters that voiced support for the bill. “He seems to be a pro-business governor, but I really don’t know what his mindset is,” said Mike Doolan, a manager at Market Square Liquors in Tallahassee. Opponents argue the change would hurt small liquor stores, eliminate jobs, result in a greater ability for minors to get liquor and lead to more impulse-buying of alcohol. “Walmart has a competitive edge,” Doolan said. “They buy in such large quantities, that there is no way the person with two or three liquor stores can compete with them price-wise.” Wal-Mart is in favor of the ‘liquor wall’ bill. Nick Ut AP Proponents counter that the policy promotes a free market and provides more convenience to shoppers. They also dispute the argument about minors getting access to liquor, saying minors are more likely to get alcohol at home. Sen. Anitere Flores, a Miami Republican who sponsored the bill, said the existing law is “antiquated.” “The current alcohol separation law in the state of Florida is outdated and creates an uneven playing field for retailers,” Flores said in a statement last week. “Repealing this law will bring Florida into the modern era, and allows us to join the majority of the country that puts retailers and the entrepreneurial spirit first. SB 106 is about knocking down the arbitrary wall and applauding competition and a fair marketplace.” The measure got through the Senate in a 21-17 vote on March 23. The issue has been heavily lobbied in the Capitol in recent years. If approved by Scott, the bill would affect the business models of retailers on both sides of the debate. Along with the independent liquor stores and ABC Fine Wine & Spirits, Publix has been involved because it operates stand-alone liquor stores in many of the same shopping centers as its grocery stores. Meanwhile, retailers such as Target, Walmart and Costco want to be able to sell liquor in the same stores where shoppers pick up groceries and other goods. In addition to repealing the Depression-era law, the bill would prohibit new package stores from being licensed within 1,000 feet of schools; require small bottles, 6.8 ounces or less, to be displayed only behind the counter; and require that checkout clerks under the age of 18 be supervised by people 18 or older when alcohol is being purchased. The measure also includes a provision that could benefit Sam’s Club and Costco by carving out businesses with more than 10,000 square-feet of retail space from a prohibition on the state issuing liquor licenses to gas stations where beer and wine may be sold. To help Publix with its existing leases, the bill would stagger the repeal, limiting the percentage of liquor that could be stocked in chain stores over a four-year period.

It has structured training programs and started series of workshops for its small and medium-sized (SME) suppliers, which will help them to evaluate their GST compliance levels and prepare for the transition, Walmart India said in a statement. Walmart India Private, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Wal- Mart Stores Inc has completed two such programmes in Ludhiana and Hyderabad, which was attended by its 76 supplier partners, it added. Walmart India president and CEO Krish Iyer said: "At Walmart India, our teams are working diligently to be 100 per cent GST ready in time and we remain committed to help our partners in the whole process for a win-win and smooth transition to the new tax regime." The company is planning to have several such workshops in Delhi, UP and central India over the next few weeks for its partners. "As a significant number of our supplier base constitutes of SME and regional suppliers, these workshops are expected to educate them and accelerate their preparation by providing them with a platform to answer queries and concerns," he further added. Last week, the GST Council had finalised tax rates for services under the new regime set to kick in from July 1.

Nestlé Waters joins the ranks of some of the world’s largest companies, including 3M Co., Coca-Cola Co., Colgate-Palmolive Co., Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Johnson & Johnson, Keurig Green Mountain, PepsiCo Inc. and the PespiCo Foundation, Procter & Gamble Co., Unilever, Wal-Mart, and the Wal-Mart Foundation, as part of Closed Loop Fund. Nestlé Waters says its investment is part of a shared effort among business, government and community partners to fund comprehensive recycling infrastructure and programs in cities across the United States. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates that 75 percent of the waste stream in the U.S. is recyclable, but only 30 percent is recycled. Aside from the environmental impacts, municipalities and businesses in the U.S. spent more than $5 billion in 2015 disposing of materials in landfills. Much of these materials, such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic, is in demand among manufacturers as raw material for everything from textiles to packaging, says Nestlé Waters.  “The United States has one of the lowest recycling rates of any industrialized country, but it doesn’t have to stay that way. The U.S. has an opportunity to lead the way in recycling, while creating jobs, economic growth and a more sustainable future,” says Nelson Switzer, chief sustainability officer at Nestlé Waters North America. “As a company, we are on a very deliberate journey toward zero landfill waste in our products and operations, so I can think of no better opportunity than working collectively to ensure these recyclable materials are transformed from garbage to the valuable resources that they are.”   To date, Closed Loop Fund says it has diverted more than 100,000 tons of recyclable content from landfill, and the 11 projects currently funded are poised to divert 4 million tons by 2025. In that same time frame, the fund aims to: eliminate more than 40 million tons of greenhouse gas; divert more than 20 million cumulative tons of waste from landfills; provide a $40 million economic benefit to municipalities; and prove replicable models that will help unlock additional investment in recycling. “Nestlé Waters’ commitment to Closed Loop Fund is a significant investment in creating shared value across the recycling supply chain,” says Rob Kaplan, managing director of Closed Loop Fund. “The investment will enable people to recycle more, and efficiently turn those packages into new products. It will save taxpayer dollars and improve the recycling system.”   Nestlé Waters says this investment in Closed Loop Fund is the latest in its efforts to help shape products and systems that contribute toward sustainable consumption, and help the company achieve zero environmental impact by 2030. Having pioneered the lightweight bottle, the company says it has reduced the plastic content of its bottles by more than 60 percent since 1994. In April 2017, Nestlé Waters reached a milestone in its use of recycled plastic content (rPET), announcing that 9 out of 10 of its California-born Arrowhead Mountain Spring Water bottles incorporate 50 percent postconsumer recycled plastic content. As a result, 1.8 billion bottles have been kept from landfills, and the 86 million pounds of recycled plastic has saved 69,660 tons of carbon emissions—the equivalent of 39,000 round trip flights from New York to Los Angeles, according to the company.

just-style home News & insights News US Q1 in brief – JC Penney, Foot Locker, Cato Corp By Michelle Russell and Beth Wright | 22 May 2017 Font size Email Print In the most recent first-quarter filings from US apparel and footwear brands and retailers, Walmart delivered an encouraging start to the year thanks to higher sales, while Ross Stores booked growth despite market volatility. Kate Spade, meanwhile, saw earnings slump on the back of sales declines, while Hudson's Bay recorded comparable store declines on the back of lower domestic store traffic across all banners.  JC Penney Retail giant JC Penney said it saw an improvement in women's apparel, despite widening its net loss to US$180m in the first quarter, compared to net loss of $68m in the year-ago period. For the three months ended 29 April, gross margin was up 10 basis points to 36.3 %, positively impacted by improved selling margins throughout the quarter, which was partially offset by the continued growth in the company's online and major appliance businesses. Net sales meanwhile, slipped 3.7% to $2.7bn from $2.8bn last year. Comparable store sales were down 3.5% for the quarter. CEO Marvin Ellison, said: "We continue to make encouraging progress in the company's competitive and financial position despite our top-line performance during the first quarter. While February was a very challenging month for JCPenney and broader retail, we are pleased with our comp store sales for the combined March and April period, which improved significantly versus February." Foot Locker US footwear retailer Foot Locker said its first-quarter was one of the company's most profitable in its history, despite a slip in net income and falling short of its original expectations. For the period ended 29 April, net income was US$180m, compared to $191m in the year-ago period. Total sales meanwhile, increased 0.7% to $2bn, compared with sales of $1.99bn for the corresponding prior-year period. Comparable-store sales were up 0.5%, while gross margin decreased to 34% from 35% a year ago. CEO Richard Johnson said: "The slow start we experienced in February, which we believe was largely due to the delay in income tax refunds, was unfortunately not fully offset by much stronger sales in March and April. Nonetheless, we believe our banners remain at the centre of a vibrant sneaker culture. We are confident that our customers have not lost their tremendous appetite for athletic footwear and apparel and that our position in the industry is stronger than ever." Cato Corp Cato Corp reported a fall in both sales and earnings for the first quarter, with net income slipping 38% to US$22.2m from $35.9m last year. First-quarter gross margin decreased 390 basis points to 38.7%, primarily due to lower merchandise margins and deleveraging of buying and occupancy costs. Meanwhile, total sales fell to $239.7m, compared to $288m in the year-ago period. Same-store sales were also down, slipping 17%. CEO John Cato said: ""Our negative sales trend persisted throughout the first quarter, impacting margins and earnings as we continued to work through our merchandise missteps," stated John Cato, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer. "It is taking longer to work through these issues than expected and the remainder of the year will be impacted. We expect earnings for the year to be below last year." The Buckle The Buckle booked a drop in both earnings and sales in the first quarter, with the former dropping to US$16.3m from $23.1m a year earlier. Revenues were down 12.8% to $212.3m from net sales of $243.5m for the year-ago period, while comparable sales fell 12.7%. Online sales were down 7.2% to $21.8m for the 13-week period ended 29 April. The Buckle also announced senior vice president of finance and CFO, Karen Rhoads,who joined the company in 1980, will retire later this summer. Rhoads will continue to serve as a member of the company's board of directors. The board has engaged an executive search firm to assist with the search for Rhoads' replacement. The Bon-Ton Stores US department store retailer The Bon-Ton Stores widened its net loss to US$57.3m in the first quarter, compared to $37.8m in the year-ago period. The York, Pennsylvania-based company saw total sales fall by 9.3% to $536.1m from $591m in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Comparable store sales decreased 8.8% as compared with the prior year period. Meanwhile, gross margin decreased 170 basis points to 32.2% compared to last year, primarily due to an increase in the markdown rate and increased delivery expenses. CEO Kathryn Bufano said: "Our first quarter results did not meet our expectations due primarily to weak mall traffic trends, unfavourable weather and marketing challenges associated with the Easter calendar shift." Ross Stores Ross Stores booker higher sales and earnings in its first-quarter despite uncertainty and volatility in the market. Earnings reached US$321m from $291m a year earlier. Total sales were up 7% to $3.3bn, while comparable store sales grew 3%. Operating margin of 15.2% exceeded company expectations due to above-plan sales and merchandise margin. For the second quarter, the company is forecasting same store sales to be up 1% to 2%, on top of a 4% gain last year, with earnings per share of $0.73 to $0.76, up from $0.71 in the prior year period. Stage Stores Stage Stores widened its net loss to US$19m from $15.5m in the first quarter as the company incurred after-tax charges primarily associated with the Gordmans acquisition of about $4m. Net sales were also down, falling 7.3% to $308.6m, compared to $332.8m in the prior year. Meanwhile, comparable sales decreased 9.6%. CEO Michael Glazer, noted: "After a challenging February in which we saw negative double digit comps, we began to gain momentum and our business improved significantly during the combined March and April period. While we expect retail headwinds to continue in the near term, we believe that our selective acquisition of prime Gordmans' assets allows us to diversify with an off-price business model. We expect the acquisition to add scale to our business and be meaningfully accretive to our earnings in 2018." Perry Ellis Perry Ellis said it was pleased with a "solid start" to fiscal 2018, with top and bottom line results surpassing guidance, reflecting solid growth in its core brands driven by the earlier shipment of Spring merchandise and strong gross margin expansion. For the three month period, as reported under GAAP, net income was US$12.8m, compared to GAAP net income of $14.3m last year. GAAP Gross margin expanded 120 basis points to 37.6%, while adjusted gross margin expanded 90 basis points. Meanwhile, total sales dropped 7.3% to $242m from $261m last year, but ahead of guidance of $230mto $235 million. The company said the decline reflected a planned decrease in shipments given a reduction of customers' doors and inventory discipline to drive higher margin sales. Walmart Walmart has delivered what analysts say is an encouraging start to the year as sales grew 1.4% in the quarter to US$117.5bn. Excluding currency, sales were up 2.5% to $118.8bn. In its domestic market revenues were up 2.9% to $75.4bn, while international sales climbed 3.5% to $27.1bn. Net earnings, meanwhile, were down 1.3% in the period to $3.04bn. "We delivered a solid first-quarter and we're encouraged by the start to the year. We're moving faster to combine our digital and physical assets to make shopping simple and easy for customers," said CEO Doug McMillon. The Children's Place The Children's Place has booked what it says are "outstanding" operating results in the quarter with comparable sales, operating margin and earnings significantly above last year and the high end of its guidance. Net sales increased 4.1% to US$436.7m on the back of a comparable retail sales increased of 6.1%. Operating margin improved 170 basis points to 11.1%, while net income reached $36.2m from $26m a year earlier. American Eagle Outfitters American Eagle Outfitters booked a mixed first-quarter as earnings slipped but sales increased. For the period ended 29 April, net income fell to US$25.2m from $40.5m last year. Gross margin decreased 270 basis points to 36.5% from 39.2% last year, primarily due to increased promotional activity and higher shipping costs related to a strong digital business. Meanwhile, total net revenue was up 2% to $761.8m, compared to $749.4m in the year-ago period. Consolidated comparable sales were also up 2%, following a 6% increase last year. CEO Jay Schottenstein said: "The first quarter results reflected mall traffic headwinds, especially early in the quarter, with improved trends over Easter and a strong digital business throughout. As we look ahead, we are taking the right steps to improve our results and adjust our business for today's rapidly evolving retail environment." L Brands  L Brands booked a fall in both sales and earnings for the first quarter, with net income slipping to US$94.1m from $152.3m last year. For the three months ended 29 April, net sales fell 7% to $2.44bn compared to $2.61bn in the year-ago period. Comparable sales were also down, falling 9%. L Brands noted the exit of the swim and apparel categories had a negative impact of 6 percentage points and 9 percentage points to total company and Victoria's Secret comparable sales, respectively. Looking ahead, the company increased its guidance for 2017 full-year earnings per share to $3.10 to $3.40 from $3.05 to $3.35 previously, and issued guidance for second quarter earnings per share between $0.40 and $0.45. Target Corp US retail group Target said its first-quarter financial performance was "better" than its expectations, as net earnings rose 7.7% to US$681m from $632m in the year-ago period. For the three months ended 29 April, sales slipped 1.1% to $16.0bn compared to $16.2bn last year, reflecting a comparable sales decline of 1.3%, partially offset by the contribution from new stores. Digital channel sales however increased, up by 22% and contributing 0.8 percentage points to comparable sales growth. Gross margin narrowed to 30.5%, compared with 30.9% in the year-ago period, reflecting increased digital channel fulfilment costs.  CEO Brian Cornell, said: "We are in the early stage of a multi-year effort to position Target for profitable, consistent long-term growth, and while we are confident in our plans, we are facing multiple headwinds in the current landscape. As a result, we will continue to plan our business prudently while preparing our team to chase business when we have an opportunity." Urban Outfitters Teen retailer Urban Outfitters saw net income slip 59.8% in the first quarter, falling to US$11.9m from $29.6m in the year-ago period. Net sales were also down in the period, falling 0.2% to $761.2m compared to $762.6m last year. Total comparable retail segment net sales decreased 3.1%. By brand, comparable sales increased 1.5% at Free People, but decreased 3.1% at Urban Outfitters and 4.4% at the Anthropologie Group. The company said comparable sales were driven by strong, double-digit growth in the direct-to-consumer channel, but were offset by negative retail store comparable net sales. CEO Richard Hayne, said: "During the first quarter we continued to see strong double-digit growth from our direct-to-consumer channel and our wholesale business. We believe we have significant opportunity to continue to grow both of these channels at all of our brands." Dick's Sporting Goods Omni-channel sporting goods retailer Dick's Sporting Goods said that despite a challenging retail environment, it realised growth across each of its three primary categories of hardlines, apparel and footwear in the first quarter. For the period ended 29 April, net income reached US$58.2m compared to $56.9m in the year-ago period. Net sales were also up, increasing 9.9% to $1.8bn from $1.7bn last year. Looking ahead, CEO Edward Stack said the company will continue to "evaluate and adjust" its business model, and is taking actions to reduce its expense structure in order to fund and develop its longer-term strategic initiatives. TJX Companies TJX Companies said it has  great confidence in the continued, successful growth of the company after booking increases in both sales and earnings in the first quarter. For the period ended 29 January, net income reached US$536.3m, compared to $508.3m in the year-ago period. Gross profit margin was 29.0%, up 0.2 percentage points versus the prior year. Net sales meanwhile, increased by 3% to $7.8bn from $7.5bn last year, while consolidated comparable store sales increased 1%. Differential Brands Group Differential Brands Group, which owns Robert Graham and Hudson Clothing, narrowed its net loss in the first quarter. For the period ended 31 March, net loss was US$2.4m, compared to $6.5m for the prior year period. Net sales meanwhile, were up 19% to $40.1m from $33.7m in the prior year period, reflecting a 22% increase in wholesale segment sales and a 9% increase in consumer direct segment sales. The company added the sales increase was primarily due to sales from the addition of the Hudson Jeans and Swims brands for the full period. Gross margin fell to 46.4% compared to 48.5%last year, reflecting the inclusion of Hudson Jeans for the full quarter as well as the inclusion of Swims, which carry lower gross margin rates as primarily wholesale businesses. CEO Michael Buckley said the company is "pleased" with the progress it has made during the quarter, especially in its e-commerce business, which saw a 46% sales increase. Dillard's Dillard's has booked a drop in earnings and sales in its first-quarter, with net income falling to US$66.3m from $77.4m in the year-ago period. Net sales dropped to $1.42bn from $1.50bn a year earlier, while gross margin from retail operations improved 65 basis points. CEO William Dillard said that while the company's sales decline weighed heavily onits operating results, it still ended the quarter with $302m of cash, largely due to better cash management. Nordstrom Upscale US fashion retailer Nordstrom has booked first-quarter earnings in line with expectations. For the period ended 29 April, net earnings were up 37% to US$63m, from $46m in the year ago period. Net sales were also up, rising 2.7% to $3.3bn, compared to $3.2bn last year, while comparable sales slipped by 0.8%. This was consistent with trends experienced over the past year, Nordstrom said. Meanwhile, online sales were 24% of total net sales, driven by 11% growth at Nordstrom.com and 19% at Nordstromrack.com/HauteLook. Hudson's Bay Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) has booked a drop in comparable sales in what it described as a difficult first-quarter, particularly in the US where the group has experienced lower store traffic across all its banners. On a constant currency basis, consolidated comparable sales were down 2.9%. DSG (Hudson's Bay, Lord & Taylor, and Home Outfitters) saw sales fall 2.4%, while Saks Fifth Avenue sales fell 4.8%. In Europe, HBC sales were remained flat. Comparable digital sales were up 5.4%. Macy's US department store retailer Macy's says its first-quarter sales and earnings results were consistent with its expectations, and that it remains on track to meet its 2017 guidance. Earnings in the period dropped to $71m from $115m last year, while gross margin narrowed to 38.1% from 39.1% in the prior year period. Sales totalled $5.34bn, a drop of 7.5% on sales of $5.77bn in the same period last year, reflecting, in part, store closures. Comparable sales on an owned basis were down 5.2%. Kohl's US department store retailer Kohl's has booked mixed first-quarter results as earnings climbed but sales fell. Earnings were up 14% to US$66m from $58m a year earlier, while gross margin improved 83 basis points to 36.4%. Sales, meanwhile, were down 3.2% to $3.84bn. CEO Kevin Mansell, however, said there had been a "significant improvement" in sales and traffic for the March and April period, after a weak February. "Continued strong inventory management led to a major improvement in gross margin, and our teams managed expenses exceptionally well." Wolverine Worldwide Wolverine Worldwide booked what it says was a solid start to the year with earnings and sales that beat expectations and strong progress towards its strategic transformation plan. Revenues dropped 4.8% to US$591.3m due to an additional week of operations in the first quarter of 2017. Underlying revenue declined 2%. Earnings dropped to $16.7m from $17.4m, while gross margin widened slightly to 39.7% from 39.6% last year. "The transformation of our business is well underway with our strategy focused on elevating our most powerful brands with consumers, delivering continuous product innovation and sustained organic growth, and unlocking incremental operational efficiencies, with an emphasis on pace and speed," said CEO Blake Krueger. Iconix Brand Group Iconix moved to a loss in its first-quarter on the back of declining sales as the the company looks to implement initiatives aimed at improving its balance sheet and driving organic growth. Losses amounted to US$4.3m from earnings of $18.6m a year earlier. Operating income declined 27% to $33.6m, while licensing revenue fell 13% to $58.7m. Separately, Iconix announced the sale of its entertainment segment for $345m in cash. Citi Trends  US value fashion retailer Citi Trends said total sales in the 13 weeks to 29 April increased 3.2% to US$200m, compared to $193.7m in the year-ago period. Comparable store sales meanwhile, were up 1% from the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Acting CEO Bruce Smith, said: "We are pleased to report that our improved merchandising strategies are driving better performance, as demonstrated by the increase in our first quarter comparable store sales. After a very slow start to the quarter due to the later disbursement of tax refunds by the Internal Revenue Service, we were able to more than make up February's 21% comparable store sales decline with increases of 13% in March and 18% in April." Weyco Weyco saw both sales and earnings slip in its first-quarter in the face of what it called a "challenging" retail environment. For the three months to 31 March, net earnings attributable to the company fell 17% to US$2.2m from $2.7m in the year-ago period. Meanwhile, net sales for the quarter slipped to $69.1m, down 12% from $78.9m last year. CEO Thomas Florsheim Jr said: "The retail environment continues to be challenging, as retailers address reduced foot traffic in their brick and mortar stores. We continue to seek growth across all trade channels and are working to reduce our costs.  This quarter we saw higher gross margins and reductions in several categories of selling and administrative costs as a result of our efforts."    Hanesbrands US fashion retailer Hanesbrands said it is off to the strong start of 2017 that it sought, despite net income slipping 12% to US$70.6m from $80.3m in the year-ago period. Net sales meanwhile, increased 13.2% to $1.38bn from $1.22bn last year, thanks to acquisition contributions. Sales for the activewear and international segments increased, while sales decreased as expected for the innerwear segment and manage-for-cash businesses. Hanes has also launched a multiyear initiative to increase investment for growth, reduce costs, and drive cash flow. Project Booster, is expected to drive the company's Sell More, Spend Less, Generate Cash business strategy and is expected to generate about $100m in annualised net cost savings, and $300m of incremental annual net cash from operations after annualised growth reinvestment of $50m. The company has also recently announced the departure of CFO Richard Moss who will retire at the end of 2017. Hanesbrands has initiated an internal and external search for his successor.  VF Corp US apparel giant VF Corporation said its first-quarter results were "right in line" with expectations, despite a 2% fall in both sales and earnings for the period. Net income fell to US$209.2m in the three months to March, from $260.3m the year before. As a result of the sale of its licensed sports group business to Fanatics, VF's net loss from discontinued operations was $5.5m the first quarter of 2017. Gross margin improved 150 basis points to 50.2% on a reported basis, while total revenues fell to $2.55bn from $2.60bn in the year-ago period. Brand revenue at Vans was up 5% and by 6% at The North Face., but fell 5% at Timberland. For fiscal 2017, VF Corp is forecasting revenue to increase at a low single-digit percentage rate. Columbia Sportswear Columbia Sportswear has revealed record first-quarter net sales of US$543.8m, a 4% increase compared with net sales of $525.1m last year. Net income also reached record levels, up 13% to $36m from $31.8m in the year ago period. For the year ahead, the company expects net sales growth of around 3%, and net income of between $192m and $199m. CEO Tim Boyle said: "Our first quarter results provide a good start to a year that presents many challenges, especially in the US, which has been impacted by customer bankruptcies, liquidations and ongoing efforts by US.retailers to rationalise their store fleets and square footage. We were encouraged by the Columbia brand's continued growth in Europe-direct markets during the first quarter and by the Sorel brand's successful launch of an expanded Spring assortment. In addition, our direct-to-consumer businesses were a source of growth in every region. "In the midst of changing consumer shopping patterns, our portfolio of powerful brands and strong balance sheet give us the ability to continue to drive sustainable, profitable growth." Amazon Online retail giant Amazon has booked increases in both sales and earnings in its first-quarter thanks to new product and service launches globally, including seven private apparel brands to Prime members. Net income reached US$724m from $513m a year prior. Net sales were up 23% to $35.7bn. Excluding a $492m unfavourable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates throughout the quarter, net sales increased 24%. Under Armour Under Armour's share price has spiked after the athletic wear maker posted a first-quarter loss that was better than analyst expectations and reaffirmed its full-year outlook. The loss for the three months to the end of March amounted to US$2.3m from earnings of $19.2m a year ago. Gross margin dropped 70 basis points to 45.2%. Net sales, however, grew 7% to $1.1bn. "Our first quarter results were in line with our expectations and we're off to a solid start in 2017," said Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank. "By proactively managing our growth to deliver superior innovative product, continuing to strengthen our connection with consumers and increasing our focus on operational excellence - we have great confidence in our ability to drive toward our full year targets." Carter's Carter's booked a mixed first-quarter, with a slight rise in sales but a 13.6% decrease in net income from US$54m to $46.7m. Operating margin also decreased, falling 210 basis points to 10.7%. Net sales, meanwhile, grew 1.2% to $732.8m, reflecting growth in the company's domestic retail and wholesale sales, which was partially offset by a decline in International sales. CEO Michael Casey, said: "We achieved our sales and earnings objectives in the first quarter. Stronger than planned demand in our wholesale and ecommerce businesses helped to offset the effects of delayed tax refunds to families with young children and a later Easter holiday. "We have seen a meaningful improvement in sales trends in April, driven by Easter holiday shopping, and expect good growth in sales and earnings in the balance of the year."  Steve Madden US footwear and accessories specialist Steve Madden said it pleased to have started off 2017 with a strong first-quarter, despite delivering a 15.6% drop in earnings. For the three months ended 31 March, net income fell to US$20.2m from $23.7m last year. However, the company said its highlight of the quarter was its Steve Madden women's wholesale footwear division, which enjoyed a period of "outstanding growth in a challenging retail environment". Net sales increased 11.2% to $366.4m, compared to $329.4m in the year-ago period. Gross margin widened to 36.2%, compared to 35.3% last year. CEO Edward Rosenfeld said the company will take a prudent approach to planning its business in light of retail industry headwinds, but added the strength in its core business "gives us confidence that we are well-positioned to navigate the uncertain environment".  Skechers Despite first-quarter net sales representing a new quarterly record and the first time the company has exceeded US$1bn in quarterly sales, footwear maker Skechers saw earnings slip in the three months ended 31 March. Sales in the quarter were up 9.6% to $1.07bn on last year, primarily due to a 16.8% increase in the company's international wholesale business and a 12.8% rise in its company-owned global retail business which included comparable same-store sales increases of 2.9%. However, earnings slipped 3.7% to $94m, compared to $97.6m in the year-ago period. CEO David Weinberg said: "We are particularly proud of the growth in the quarter considering the tough comparison to 2016, which included the benefit of an additional day in February and Easter falling in March." Rocky Brands Rocky Brands says it has made a "solid start" to 2017 as it moved to a profit thanks to doubling its military segment sales to a quarterly record US$12m. Net income in the three months ended 31 March amounted to $1.5m from a loss of $0.2m a year earlier. Net sales meanwhile, increased 9.6% to $63.1m, compared to $57.5m in the year-ago period. Wholesale sales declined 2.5% to $39.2m, while retail sales edged up to $11.9m from $11.5m. Gross margin dropped 160 basis points to 31.3%, driven by the increase in military segment sales which carry lower gross margins than its wholesale and retail segments. CEO Mike Brooks said: "The actions we have taken over the past six months to better position the company for profitable growth are clearly gaining traction. While there is still work ahead of us in order to maximise shareholder value over the long-term, we are confident we are heading in the right direction." Kate Spade & Co Kate Spade saw earnings slump to US$1.4m in the three months ended 1 April, from $11.6m a year earlier. The company incurred a $7m of pre-tax store impairment charge and $2m of pre-tax fees and expenses related to its strategic review. Gross margin widened to 63.2% from 61.8%, but net sales dropped 1.2% to $271m. Same-store sales fell 2.4% for the quarter, and were down 8.1% excluding e-commerce.  Direct-to-consumer comparable sales fell 2%. Levi Strauss & Co Jeans giant Levi Strauss & Co saw net sales increase in the first quarter, up 4% to US$1.10bn from $1.06bn in the year-ago period. In the three months ended 26 February, net income slipped to $60m, down 9% from $66m last year. The decline primarily reflected lower gross margins, the San Francisco-based company said. Gross margin narrowed to 51.2% from 53%. In Europe, net revenues were up 12%, while in the Americas sales dropped by 1% and Asia net revenues declined 2%. "Despite the on-going challenges in the industry, I am pleased that we delivered 5% currency-neutral growth over a strong Q1 last year," said Chip Bergh, president and CEO. "We were able to deliver these solid results despite a declining US wholesale business, because of the breadth of our portfolio. Specifically, we grew in all three regions, with particularly outstanding results in Europe; double digit growth in our direct-to-consumer business; and double digit growth on women's and tops."

TNS Wal-Mart Academy students from left, Celia Flores Lagunas, Cherie Johnson and Janet Holcomb make a short video showing the product cycle at a typical Wal-Mart, including unloading new merchandise. Wal-Mart Academy trainer Erin Trotter, standing, trains employees in classrooms at the Wal-Mart Supercenter in Shawnee, Kan. (Keith Myers/Kansas City Star/TNS) SHAWNEE, Kan. Jesse Rice’s job is to sell meat in the grocery department of a Kansas City Wal-Mart store. But ask him what he does and you’ll hear him sell himself as well as his employer. He’ll tell you how he uses the retailer’s “My Productivity” tool to help with cross merchandising – to, say, pull buns from the bread shelves and display them next to the hot dogs and hamburger meat in grilling season, but not at Easter when hams get pride of place. “I strive for excellence. I want perfection,” Rice said. “I know that’s impossible, but at the same time, we are definitely striving for it. We want the customers to come in and find everything they need. And if they have questions, we want everyone to be there, to be able to help them.” Wal-Mart officials shepherding a reporter and photographer in the rare access behind the scenes at Wal-Mart insist that Rice wasn’t coached to say that. It could well be that there’s no faking the enthusiasm of a young man who’s a couple of days into the new Wal-Mart Academy, a training program that by the end of 2017 will have reached a quarter million employees of the world’s largest retailer. For Rice, the meat department isn’t just a low-wage or temporary job. He sees a career path where others may see a dead-end. He intends to one day become a store manager and, beyond that, a market manager supervising multiple stores. All of the dozen front-line hourly supervisors or department managers recently grouped around a training table in the back of the Shawnee, Kan., Wal-Mart store may not share Rice’s thoughts or goals, but for a few days they were captive to – and clearly engaged in – a concentrated Wal-Mart effort, new this year, to infuse consistency across its massive retail landscape. “Retail is changing,” said Erica Jones, a Wal-Mart public relations person from the company’s Bentonville, Ark., headquarters. “The way customers shop is changing. We need to provide our associates more tools to keep up with the times.” While the company slows down store expansion to invest in remodeling and raising employee pay, it also is establishing dedicated training sites in select stores across the country, 100 so far and 200 by the end of the year. The Shawnee store has the Wal-Mart Academy for the Kansas City area. Its training site occupies 2,500 square feet at the back of the store, replete with ranks of desktop computers, iPads, Apple-based software and walls decorated with trademark blue and yellow graphics with upbeat messages. Ian Markley, one of 17 trainers – called facilitators – at the Shawnee academy, wears a headset and carries an electronic device as he maneuvers through a training room. Lesson information is synced onto the trainees’ individual screens or projected on a wall-mounted screen. Participants lean over small yellow pads, scribbling copious notes as Markley digs into the minutiae of restocking and order programs. In another room, facilitator Nichole Umscheid leads a class through a “replenishment cycle” exercise. She reminds them that Wal-Mart’s computer systems do 90 percent of inventory ordering automatically, but “you may need to do about 10 percent manually.” What if a forecast ice storm depletes the bread aisle or the ice-melt supplies? It’s still too early for the company to know if these exercises truly help in motivating or retaining workers. The Wal-Mart Academies debuted in February 2016 for top store managers only. In October, assistant store managers, Wal-Mart’s first level of salaried management, began cycling through. About 1,400 associates were trained in the Kansas City region in the first four months of the Shawnee Wal-Mart Academy. When all the sites are up and running, the company expects 140,000 associates to cycle through annually. That’s still a pittance of Wal-Mart’s 2 million associates because not all associates are eligible. At first glance, store managers say they’re seeing a difference among the front-line supervisors who’ve been through the new training programs – up to six weeks’ worth – designed for accelerating job titles. That doesn’t mean that every shopper will see an immediate customer service difference from every check-out clerk or stocker they encounter. But the more intensive academy training does follow the retailer’s new “Pathways Foundation” training, which every new hire is expected to complete. There’s an incentive for completion: Starting pay is $9 an hour, but it jumps to $10 when the 90-day foundation program is finished. You need to be Logged in to sign up for Express Login. The training rooms are lined with taped-up papers torn from flip-chart easels. In one exercise, participants offer up comments – things that never should be said -“It’s not my job.” “I don’t know.” “I can’t.” Cynics and critics, such as Wal-Mart workers who share comments at OUR Wal-Mart, say their experience is different. The name stands for Organization United for Respect at Wal-Mart, and the organizers say it exists “to ensure that every Associate, regardless of title, age, race, or sex, is respected at Wal-Mart.” They see an organization contrary to the training room’s flip charts. Various personal submissions on the site contend that the company pays too little, needs to provide paid sick days for part-time workers, discriminates against women and minorities in promotions, and cuts weekly work hours shorter than they need to pay their bills. Wal-Mart says it provides paid time off that can be used for paid sick days. Complaints often center on hours being cut below 30 hours a week, the level above which Wal-Mart would be required under the Affordable Care Act to offer health care insurance. Even on Wal-Mart’s own website, associates often follow up on corporate announcements with accounts of their own differing experiences. A lengthy chain earlier this year included complaints about lack of training, lack of hours, lack of opportunity for promotion, and even lack of parking spaces for workers nearer the store doors. The $10-an-hour base pay, announced last year, “is a start. But it’s not the finish,” according to OUR Wal-Mart members.

About Future Resources Staff Contact Privacy Policy Search for: Select Press Releases Home / Press Releases / Nestlé Waters North America Announces $6 Million Investment in Closed Loop Fund Nestlé Waters North America Announces $6 Million Investment in Closed Loop Fund Posted on May 22, 2017 by CSRwire Press Releases, Events and Reports in Press Releases Leadership is an overused word, and is often misused. We like this definition. May 22, 2017 /3BL Media/ – Nestlé Waters North America today announced it is investing $6 million as part of a shared effort among business, government and community partners to fund comprehensive recycling infrastructure and programs in cities across the United States. Nestlé Waters will join the ranks of some of the world’s largest companies – including 3M, Coca-Cola, Colgate-Palmolive, Goldman Sachs, Johnson & Johnson, Keurig Green Mountain, PepsiCo and the PespiCo Foundation, Procter & Gamble, Unilever, Walmart, and the Walmart Foundation – as part of Closed Loop Fund, a $100 million social impact investment fund committed to finding a national solution to the critical recycling gap in the U.S. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates that 75 percent of the waste stream in the U.S. is recyclable, but only 30 percent actually gets recycled.  Aside from the environmental impacts, municipalities and businesses in the U.S. spent over $5 billion in 2015 disposing of waste in landfills. Much of this waste, such as PET plastic, is in demand among manufacturers as raw material for everything from textiles to packaging.   “The United States has one of the lowest recycling rates of any industrialized country, but it doesn’t have to stay that way. The U.S. has an opportunity to lead the way in recycling, while creating jobs, economic growth, and a more sustainable future,” says Nelson Switzer, Chief Sustainability Officer at Nestlé Waters North America. “As a company, we are on a very deliberate journey toward zero landfill waste in our products and operations, so I can think of no better opportunity than working collectively to ensure these recyclable materials are transformed from garbage to the valuable resources that they are.” To date, Closed Loop Fund has diverted more than 100,000 tons of recyclable content, and the 11 projects currently funded are poised to divert 4 million tons by 2025. In that same timeframe, the Fund aims to: Eliminate more than 40 million tons of greenhouse gas; Divert more than 20 million cumulative tons of waste from landfills; Provide a $40M economic benefit to municipalities; Prove replicable models that will help unlock additional investment in recycling. “Nestlé Waters’ commitment to Closed Loop Fund is a significant investment in creating shared value across the recycling supply chain,” said Rob Kaplan, Managing Director of Closed Loop Fund.  “The investment will enable people to recycle more, and efficiently turn those packages into new products.  It will save taxpayer dollars and improve the recycling system.” This investment in Closed Loop Fund is just the latest in Nestlé Waters’ efforts to enhance quality of life and contribute to a healthier future for individuals and families, communities, and for the planet. Having pioneered the lightweight bottle, the company has reduced the plastic content of its bottles by over 60% since 1994. Just last month, Nestlé Waters reached a critical milestone in its use of recycled plastic content (rPET), announcing that 9 out of 10 of its California-born Arrowhead® Mountain Spring Water bottles incorporate 50% post-consumer recycled plastic content.  As a result, 1.8 billion bottles have been kept from landfills, and the 86 million pounds of recycled plastic has saved 69,660 tons of carbon emissions – the equivalent of 39,000 round trip flights from New York to Los Angeles. About Nestlé Waters North America Nestlé Waters North America provides people with an unrivaled portfolio of bottled waters for healthy hydration. Brands such as Nestlé® Pure Life®, Poland Spring®,  Perrier®, and S. Pellegrino® have driven Nestlé Waters North America to be the third largest non-alcoholic beverage company by volume in the U.S. Based in Stamford, Connecticut with over 8,500 employees nationwide, Nestlé Waters is committed to reducing its environmental footprint across operations.  The company is also committed to creating shared value and being a good neighbor in the 140 communities where it operates in the U.S.    About Closed Loop Fund  Founded in 2014, Closed Loop Fund is a social impact investment fund that provides cities and companies access to the capital required to build comprehensive recycling programs. Closed Loop Fund aims to invest $100 million by 2020 with the goal to create economic value for cities by increasing recycling rates in communities across America.

James Halpin / Published: May 22, 2017 Article Tools Font size – + Share This     Scott Sargent WILKES-BARRE — The trial of alleged Wal-Mart shooter Scott Sargent, scheduled to begin Monday morning, was delayed when his attorney raised questions about his competency as jury selection was set to begin. Sargent, 32, of Shenandoah, is facing trial on 25 counts, including attempted murder and assaulting police, in the October 2015 shooting at the Wilkes-Barre Township Marketplace on Highland Park Boulevard that horrified Saturday shoppers. After opening fire outside the crowded Wal-Mart store, Sargent got into a firefight with police, firing a shot through the windshield of a police SUV that narrowly missed a Wilkes-Barre Township police officer, according to prosecutors. The gun battle that unfolded between Wal-Mart and Chuck E. Cheese came to an end after Wilkes-Barre City police Officer Alan Gribble blasted Sargent in the abdomen with a shotgun, prosecutors said. Jury selection had been set to begin Monday morning, but Sargent’s court-appointed attorney, Joseph J. Yeager, filed a petition seeking a competency hearing before it began. “It is believed that the defendant has a severe mental health diagnoses and as such is not competent to stand trial at this time,” Yeager wrote. The attorney says Kingston psychiatrist Dr. Richard Fischbein examined Sargent earlier this month and concluded he was incompetent to stand trial. The filing says the defense is prepared to turn over its information to prosecutors in advance of a competency hearing. Assistant District Attorney Jarrett Ferentino said he was prepared to start his case Monday and that it was “disheartening” to have to explain to the law enforcement officers targeted in the shooting that the case has been further delayed. “I’ll get this individual evaluated as soon as possible by my own expert,” Ferentino said, noting he has been inquiring about a competency evaluation for the past year yet only learned last week it would be an issue. “This is a very serious case, as you know, and we’re just kicking it down the street.” Luzerne County Judge David W. Lupas said the timing was “unfortunate” but that a hearing would be required because Sargent’s competency has been questioned. He ordered the defense to turn over all its records by the end of the week and said a hearing would be set for a later date. During his argument, Ferentino noted that Sargent, who is now seeking to be deemed incompetent to stand trial, has personally written a number of “articulate filings” to the court. Among them was a motion in February seeking Yeager’s removal for what Sargent characterized as an “irreconcilable personality conflict.” Sargent maintained he has received no discovery information, nor discussed any possible defenses with Yeager. In that instance, Lupas instructed Yeager to talk to Sargent about his concerns. Sargent has also sued Luzerne County officials over allegations that staff at the jail failed to properly care for his “medical condition.” The hand-written complaint alleges jail employees failed to return him to the hospital “after multiple complaints of agonizing pain and observing (me) falling to the floor inside (my) cell curling up in excrusiating [sic] pain which was eventually diagnosed at the hospital as life threatening.” 570-821-2058, @cvjimhalpin We welcome user discussion on our site, under the following guidelines: To comment you must first create a profile and sign-in with a verified DISQUS account or social network ID.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: 3 Retail Stocks I'd Buy Right Now Just because many retailers are struggling doesn't mean that you should avoid the whole sector. Daniel B. Kline (TMFDankline) May 22, 2017 at 9:47AM The ease of shopping on the internet has created a crisis for the retail industry. Chains either need to find a compelling digital strategy in order to compete or they must find a way to get reticent customers into their stores. That's easier said than done, but it's not impossible. Retailers may be struggling, but there are still potential winners in the space. The three companies below are all very different, but each one offers significant opportunity for investors. Consumers may be shopping in different ways, but they are still shopping. Not all of that business will go to pure-digital plays, so it's just a question of which retailers will adapt best to the new reality. Wal-Mart has begun a major transformation. Image source: Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart is transforming Unlike many retailers, Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) was never in any real danger. The company has at points been less successful than it was, but it has remained a juggernaut, just one that has struggled with its digital strategy. That changed in August 2016 when the company spent $3.3 billion to acquire Jet.com. That price may have been very steep to acquire a money-losing website, but the point of the purchase was to acquire Jet CEO Marc Lore and his management team. Lore now runs both Jet.com and Wal-Mart.com and he has begun a radical transformation of how Wal-Mart approaches the internet. Instead of viewing online sales as a secondary sales channel, the company is now working to integrate its website and apps into everything it does. That means that stores will become an extension of its digital properties and vice versa. This won't be an easy transformation and short-term margins may take a hit due to efforts like offering free shipping on any order of at least $35 in qualifying merchandise. So far however, the results have been good. Wal-Mart saw comparable store sales rise 1.4% in Q1 and e-commerce sales spiked 63% in that period. In addition CEO Doug McMillon noted "we're moving faster to combine our digital and physical assets to make shopping simple and easy for customers," in his remarks in the earnings release. Wal-Mart has a plan that it's executing well. It has a leader in Lore who seems to be getting the CEO's full support and the company has always had the size to be price competitive with any rival. Dollar General is growing In a market where many retailers are either going out of business altogether or closing stores, Dollar General (NYSE:DG) has been growing at a furious pace. After adding approximately 900 new stores in 2016, the discount chain has stepped up its game and plans to add 1,000 new stores in 2017. Last year Dollar General grew full-year overall sales 7.9% while comparable-store sales increased 0.9%. The company expects similar results in 2017 and it has forecast a 4-6% gain in total sales with slightly positive same-store growth. Many investors would be concerned about the lack of same-store growth, but in this case Dollar General's strength is its stability. The company has a proven model which delivers predictable sales while the chain adds new locations. The company may not predict big growth numbers, but each store it adds delivers more profit to the bottom line and the markets for expansion remain extensive. J.C. Penney is doing it right J.C. Penney (NYSE:JCP) may seem like an unlikely player to be on this list as the department store has been struggling. It has either closed or plans to close nearly 140 stores and sales decreased slightly and comparable-store sales fell 3.5% in its most-recent quarter. Those are bumps in the road, and the company has a tough journey ahead of it, but its CEO Marvin Ellison has a plan that it's executing well. J.C. Penney has taken steps to turn its stores into destinations by adding store-within-a-store Sephora shops, revamping its salons, and adding appliance showrooms to over half its stores. In addition the chain has moved into home services, a market once dominated by its rival Sears, a chain that has been rapidly ceding markets to J.C. Penney. "We continue to make encouraging progress in the company's competitive and financial position despite our top-line performance during the first quarter," said Ellison in the earnings release. "...Our teams remain committed to executing on our strategic growth initiatives, and we are confident in our ability to drive sustainable growth and long-term profitability for JCPenney." It's not going to be easy for J.C. Penney, but the company is healthier than it once was and it has a path back to viability. This stock is not the sure thing that Wal-Mart and Dollar General are, but it may offer the most upside given how far the company has fallen and how close to the edge it is.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 22 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman 40% of Pet Owners Purchase Pet Products From Online Retailers ROCKVILLE, Md., May 22, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — The Internet is the new „pet parent,” as a dramatic force reshaping the market landscape, according to research firm Packaged Facts in the brand new report U.S. Pet Market Outlook, 2017-2018. Packaged Facts found that a large percentage of pet product sales growth is online. In addition, merger and acquisition (M&A) activity since 2016—including Mars’ purchase of VCA Inc. and other veterinary practice consolidation, PetSmart’s acquisition of Chewy.com, and Walmart’s acquisition of Jet.com—all point to a structural remix of the pet market. „Ecommerce has accelerated its shift from being a Wild West boomtown toward becoming the market’s retail California,” says David Sprinkle, research director, Packaged Facts. „As a result brick-and-mortar retailers and manufacturers are scrambling to regroup to avoid losing ground. Retailers are adapting to compete with the internet’s—specifically Amazon’s—ballooning strength in pet product sales. Brand manufacturers are adapting because their entrenched lock on shelf space is increasingly irrelevant for shelf-stable online purchasable products such as dry and canned pet food or cat litter.” According to Packaged Facts’ 2017 National Pet Owner Survey, 40% of pet owners buy pet products online, up from 37% the previous year, and notably higher than survey results from 2014. Not only are higher numbers of consumers buying pet products online, but consumers are spending more of their pet product dollars online with an ever increasing number of consumers agreeing that they purchase pet products online more than they used to.   So how are traditional retailers competing aside from beefing up their own online presence?  For specialty pet superstores such as PetSmart and Petco, one way is capitalizing on their established relationships with customers who know what to expect from the in-store experience and from the services offered there. Packaged Facts emphasizes that a critical differentiator for pet specialty stores are non-medical pet services such as grooming, boarding, and training. Indeed, as premium products have become increasingly available online, services are what make pet specialty stores stand out. „Looking at trends more broadly, brick-and-mortar retailers have decided that this is the best way to compete with the low costs and convenience of e-commerce – by offering services and experiences you really only can get in-person,” says Sprinkle. Supermarkets too are fighting to retain their share of the pet market against pet superstores, discount-driven Walmart, and of course online retailers. Supermarkets are increasing the size and scope of their pet care departments, sponsoring pet contests, running promotions with animal rescue groups and even filling pet prescriptions at stores with pharmacies in an effort to lure pet owners into the store. About „U.S. Pet Market Outlook, 2017-2018” With this latest edition of our Pet Market Outlook, Packaged Facts delivers all you need to know about the pet industry in one source. This year’s edition includes the latest in market sizing and projections, hot new product trends, as well as data from Packaged Facts proprietary Pet Owners Survey.

Here’s the outlook for IT pay One big downside of the plethora of e-commerce shopping bots out there today is that they create the impression of a difference when there may not be one. If I may give my two cents’ worth, is a two-cent difference meaningful, especially when shipping prices are far more than that? Significant difference or not, shoppers love them. And even more importantly, they act on them. When a bot lists a product and shows 20 different sites, the ranking by lowest price is almost always selected. After price, reputation and customer reviews can play a role, but none persuade as effectively as price. That’s why Walmart, which wears its tagline about having the lowest prices the way Marley’s Ghost wears his chains (each one is weighed down by bad decisions made years ago), takes pricebots so seriously. Unfortunately for Walmart, so does Amazon. And Amazon doesn’t seem to care one bit for Walmart’s price trackers — and chose to block them all. This data comes courtesy of an intriguing Reuters story: "Earlier this year, engineers at Wal-Mart who track rivals' prices online got a rude surprise: the technology they were using to check Amazon.com several million times a day suddenly stopped working. Amazon's maneuver that halted Wal-Mart in January took aim at a specialized Web browser called PhantomJS. Unlike, say, Internet Explorer, this browser is designed specifically for programmers — a telltale clue that its users are not typical shoppers. Amazon put up a digital curtain to hide its listings from PhantomJS users, according to three people familiar with the situation." The Reuters piece also pointed to an older Amazon patent that describes an "encryption technology that would force bots, but not humans, to solve a complicated algorithm to gain access to its web pages. [ To comment on this story, visit Computerworld's Facebook page. ] Not surprisingly, the bot and counter-bot tactics resemble military efforts to thwart missiles. When the technology is launched to thwart the antimissile defenses, it forces the antimissile defenses to create a system to thwart that maneuver in turn. Ultimately, though, this price bot arms race is futile. The only meaningful long-term strategy has to be on factors other than pricing. Although Amazon is aggressive on pricing, it is rarely the lowest-cost option and it still gets most competitive sales. It wins based on consumer confidence (Amazon's powerful customer support), convenience, ease of ordering and inventory that gets closer to infinite than anyone else in retail, including Alibaba. Walmart's reliance on pricing as a differentiator is an ultimately losing proposition. But it has a ready-made differentiator that is far more powerful: local stores. There is a powerful comfort factor to knowing that any problems can be resolved face-to-face at a local physical store. Another Walmart plus that is far better than pricing is reputation. Those pricebot lists of online options will list plenty of sites, but other than Amazon and maybe Target.com, few will have the name recognition of Walmart. That still means a lot to shoppers. Amazon has heavily invested in technology for decades, and trying to out-program it is simply futile. Why? Because any wins will be short-lived. Why fight Amazon on its terms when retailers can play to their own strengths and win that battle on their own terms. This article is published as part of the IDG Contributor Network. Want to Join?

The changes will increase the ways shoppers can use the  retail footprint of about 3,950 stores and supercenters as consumers integrate online options into their shopping patterns. The remodeled stores are capitalizing on building connections for shoppers, taking them from traditional in-store shopping to online sales at Walmart's e-commerce site, and finding in-between steps to blend the two. "We're moving faster to combine our digital and physical assets to make shopping easier and more enjoyable for customers," President and CEO Doug McMillon said this week in a recorded statement to investors. To do that, Walmart is making changes like: Moving in-store pickup areas to the front of the store. Testing online grocery ordering with in-store pickup in 3 southeast Michigan markets. Creating a relaxing lounge-like area for shoppers picking up online orders. Increasing the number of fresh and organic items. Expanding several departments: Produce, deli, bakery and baby. Improving navigation, including making aisles wider and angling them. Improving sight-lines, with lower product shelves and more signs. "Some of these are little things you may not notice when you walk into the store," said Anne Hatfield, director of communications for the chain. But they represent big changes in how the nation's largest retailer uses its physical space. Superstores can range from 125,000 to 190,000 square feet, yet Walmart knows its customers are making the digital transition and embracing online shopping. The remodels, it hopes, will retain existing customers and attract new ones. Besides Michigan stores, another 400-640 stores will get new looks this year. "Shopping is changing; shoppers' habits are changing," said Hatfield. "We need to make sure we're keeping up." Financial reports released on May 18 show strength for the chain even as many other retailers struggle.  Sales in Walmart's e-commerce division grew 63 percent in the first quarter of the year. Overall US sales, including fuel, grew 2.9 percent during that time, with net sales of $75.436 billion. Company-wide revenue - which includes Sam's Club stores and international locations - grew 1.4 percent. "We're  trying on many different fronts, including putting investments into our stores ... to make sure we are serving customers," Hatfield said. The Michigan stores that will be updated this year include stores in Van Buren Township and Woodhaven, both of which recently reopened with their new looks. Remodels still to come include: Hastings Grand Blanc Portage Howell Saginaw  Canton Township's Michigan Avenue store Southgate Saline Benton Harbor Lansing's Towne Centre Boulevard store Walmart also recently opened a store in Whitehall, north of Muskegon. That store featured the new look for supercenters: In addition to other changes, it has gray polished floors (rather than brown); it's lit with LED light bulbs; and most of its refrigerated and frozen foods are in closed cases for energy efficiency.  Convenience is a driver for the new store design, particularly given the chain's emphasis on groceries, which is 50 percent of its sales. That is a low-margin, competitive sector, and Walmart recently received low scores - ranking 23 out of 23 - in a Market Force Information survey of the nation's favorite grocery retailers. At the same time, many other groceries also have major remodeling underway, including Aldi and Meijer. Increasing customer engagement also is growing as store priority with the remodels. Local managers have discretion on some stocking and department sizes, based on interests of nearby shoppers. Displays are changing, too. "With remodels, you'll see more interaction with products," Hatfield said. Display tables in the electronics department will encourage shoppers to try new devices. The baby section will have a "stroller garage" for shoppers to try out, instead of boxes of new versions on a high shelf. "You'll get a better sense of what you're buying," Hatfield said. The changes at Walmart are part of continued growth as a company, Hatfield said, with corporate officials willing to consider customer reaction and whether still more changes need to be made. The challenges can feel like pressure, particularly at chains that publicly struggle. Yet they also present opportunity, Hatfield said, and Walmart is trying to embrace that. "It is a fun time to be in retail because there so much change happening," Hatfield said. "We get to learn and figure it out as we go."

Finally, Don-Wesley Andrews had enough. He quit McDonald’s in Sacramento, California, for a job at Wal-Mart. Like many other Americans, the 22-year-old Andrews improved his life just by moving to retail from fast food. Longer lunch break, paid time off, even a quarterly bonus - and no french fry fragrance clinging to his clothes. “Wal-Mart’s not perfect, but compared to fast food, it’s much, much, much better,” Andrews said. There’s plenty of talk about the retail industry dying, with malls closing and the slump stressing iconic chains like Sears and J. Crew, but healthier big-box giants such as Wal-Mart and Costco are still chronically in need of employees, at least for now. The number of US retail jobs was about the same last year compared with 2015. What’s really bedeviling retailers is annual turnover - at 65 per cent, it’s the highest since before the Great Recession - making it necessary to keep hiring. The chains are so hungry for good help they’re poaching workers from fast-food restaurants. “Those jobs tend to be more transitional, they tend to be more fluid, and as a result there tends to be higher turnover,” said Michael Harms of Dallas-based researcher TDn2K. “Even though you hear headlines like retail is dying and the robots are coming, there’s still a lot of things that need human touch points. It’s a dogfight over good employees.” When it comes to pay, stores have the edge. US retail sales workers earn a median $10.37 (Dh38) an hour, while food workers, including those at fast food, make $9.35, according to new data from the BLS. Andrews said he earns $12.12 an hour at his new job. Perhaps not coincidentally, Wal-Mart, the largest US private employer, added about 200,000 American jobs over the last decade. Italian fast-casual chain Fazoli’s is trying to fend off retail, according to Dave Craig, vice-president of human resources. “It’s a free-for-all right now,” Craig said. While the company is paying 20 cents to 30 cents more than last year, its employees still make $9.20 an hour, on average. That’s less than the minimum of $10 an hour Wal-Mart started giving people last year. Fazoli’s is trying to retain employees. The chain might nix cotton T-shirt uniforms for a Dri-Fit option that employees don’t have to tuck in. Black jeans, instead of slacks, are a possibility, too. And workers may get paid more often - the company is testing a programme that gives employees some of their earnings at the end of each shift in a debit card. Boston Market Corp. is buttering up employees, too. It’s handing out as much as $100 to those who get the best customer-survey scores. The chicken chain is spending more to advertise jobs on Facebook, Glassdoor and Twitter and is giving raises. Workers now earn $10.01 an hour, on average - about 75 cents more than last year. Pay increases in fast food are fueled by more than just the competition from retail. Higher minimum wages across the US, a better economy and a smaller labor pool to draw from - due to fewer immigrants from Mexico - also have an impact. “You have big distribution centers, you have retailers, you have other restaurant concepts, you have grocery stores, and they’re all looking for great people,” said Jason Lessman, the chain’s vice-president of human resources. “It’s just as tough as I’ve seen it in my 12 years of doing recruiting. It’s definitely a war for talent.” In 2014, Starbucks upended its workers’ dress code to include looser rules for tattoos, along with colored ties and scarves and black denim. It further loosened the rules last year inviting employees to “make a statement with hair color”. McDonald’s said last month it was upgrading its uniforms in the US to be more modern and comfortable - an effort to retain workers. “You’re going to see the labor market further tighten,” CEO Steve Easterbrook said. At the same time, the domestic dining industry is struggling. March same-store sales dropped 0.6 per cent, marking the fourth-straight month of declines, according to data from researcher MillerPulse. Profit is being hurt by the extra costs to attract and keep staff to flip burgers, assemble sandwiches and bake pizzas. That’s definitely the case in Sacramento, where many of Andrews’ Wal-Mart colleagues used to serve burritos and chalupas. “There was this joke that they literally stole half the Taco Bell crew,” he said. “There’s a lot of people that used to do fast food that made their way to the retail side.” — Washington Post More from Retail UAE sin tax spells trouble for Swiss cigar maker Dubai’s secondary malls ‘to face pressure’ Selling gold without the bazaar mentality For Roseberry, supermarkets in UAE make sense UAE retailers cannot ignore click-and-collect US fast food workers are hot property Amazon good to go with grocery store in UK German grocery giant muscles into the US tags from this storyUnited States follow this tag on MGNTwitter follow this tag on MGNFacebook follow this tag on MGN filed underGulfNewsBusinessSectorsRetail tagsUnited States follow this tag on MGN+ MGNTwitter follow this tag on MGN+ MGNFacebook follow this tag on MGN+ MGN Also In RetailUAE sin tax spells trouble for Swiss cigar maker Business Gallery Doors open to a three-day super sale Mohammad launches Marsa Al Arab project Business Videos PlayAbu Dhabi Ship Building enjoys growing success Strata UAE leads aerospace manufacturing FOLLOW US Most Popular ViewedCommentedVideosPictures 01Dubai’s secondary malls ‘to face pressure’ 02Dubai's 3-day Super Sale starts today 03Malls in Dubai have wind in their sales again Play Abu Dhabi Ship Building enjoys growing success Nov 24, 2016 Play Strata UAE leads aerospace manufacturing Oct 25, 2016 Play Emirati who created 2 successful companies Jan 02, 2016 Play Dragon Mart has latest and cheapest iPads Mar 03, 2011 13Images Mohammad launches Marsa Al Arab project May 15, 2017 1Image Pictures: Apple Store at Mall of the Emirates Oct 27, 2015 8Images Massive development at Abu Dhabi airport Mar 11, 2017 8Images Pictures: Apple Store in Abu Dhabi Oct 27, 2015 Currency Converter first-currency currencyAEDDinarRupee= first-currency currencyINRDinarRupee Most Popular on Gulf News Ramadan school timings announced When can the UAE expect Ramadan?

By Jodi O'Connell | May 22, 2017 You already know that Amazon is one of the most convenient and efficient ways to shop. The mega online retailer offers most of the same products as brick-and-mortar retailers in one place, so when you’re pressed for time or searching for an obscure item, the site can save the day. What you might not know, however, is that Amazon offers many products much cheaper than other retailers. Here are just a few everyday items you can buy for less on Amazon. ©Courtesy of Amazon Gillette Fusion Disposable Razors If you’re trying to determine what to buy on Amazon to save money, add a package of two Gillette Fusion Men’s Razors with Fusion Razor Blades to your cart. Target charges nearly $3 more for the exact same product. There’s no need to pay more than necessary for a shave, so shop for your razors on Amazon. Price on Amazon: $8.19 Price at Target: $10.99 ©Courtesy of Amazon Remington Hair Straightener Look your best without paying top dollar. The Remington T|Studio Silk Slim Straightener is over $5 more at Target than on Amazon. When you can get the exact same product for a lower price, it only makes sense to choose the lower price tag. Price on Amazon: $29.86 Price at Target: $34.99 ©Courtesy of Amazon Lysol Disinfecting Wipes Germ removal is always important, but so is the price of your Lysol Disinfecting Wipes. Save nearly $1.50 on your purchase of a 110-count container of the lemon and lime blossom scent just by shopping at Amazon instead of Walmart. The savings can add up fast — especially if you go through wipes quickly. Price on Amazon: $7.79 Price at Walmart: $9.26 Check Out: 7 Ways Amazon is Making it Easier to Spend Your Money ©Courtesy of Amazon Neutrogena Sunscreen A three-ounce bottle of Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch Sunscreen with SPF 100 costs nearly $5.50 less on Amazon than at Walgreens, making it one of the best things to buy on Amazon. Wearing sunscreen is a must, but savvy shoppers never pay more than necessary. If you’re out in the sun a lot, the savings can add up fast. Price on Amazon: $8.54 Price at Walgreens: $13.99 ©Courtesy of Amazon Crest Toothpaste Savvy shoppers know to never buy toothpaste without a coupon. They also know the best place to buy their toothpaste is Amazon. Opting to purchase an eight-ounce tube of regular Crest Cavity Protection Toothpaste at Walmart instead is a costly mistake. Lower your shopping bill by scoring two tubes on Amazon for the price of one at Walmart. Price on Amazon: $2.99 Price at Walmart: $7.34 ©Courtesy of Amazon Weight Watchers Bath Scale Investing in a bathroom scale is a great way to monitor your weight, but there’s no need to pay top dollar. Knowing what to buy on Amazon can really help you save, as the Weight Watchers Chrome and Glass Digital Bath Scale costs nearly $12 less on the site than it does at Walmart. Price on Amazon: $22.97 Price at Walmart: $34.57 ©Courtesy of Amazon Nalgene Water Bottle If you’re in the market for an eco-friendly Nalgene Tritan Wide Mouth BPA-Free Water Bottle, head to Amazon. Unless you’re set on a specific color, this is one of the smartest things to buy on Amazon. Walmart offers the same product at a higher price, so don’t pay more than necessary. Price on Amazon: As low as $9.99, depending on color Price at Walmart: $11.72 Also See: 10 Features That Make Amazon Prime Worth the Money ©Courtesy of Amazon Conair Infiniti Hairdryer If you don’t know what to buy on Amazon, you might seriously overpay. The price of the orange Conair Infiniti Pro by 1875 Watt AC Motor Dryer is one of the best examples, as it costs over $13 more at Macy’s than Amazon — and that’s when it’s on sale. The hairdryer is the same no matter where you buy it from. Save yourself some serious cash by purchasing it from Amazon. Price on Amazon: $21.24 Price at Macy’s: $34.99 ©Courtesy of Amazon Scotch Scissors Quality scissors are important for a clean cut, but you also want to get the best price. In this case, knowing what to buy on Amazon can help you save big, as the exact same eight-inch Scotch Precision Scissor costs nearly double the price at Staples than you’ll pay on Amazon. Price on Amazon: $5.29 Price at Staples: $9.99 ©Courtesy of Amazon Burt’s Bees Dog Shampoo Spoil your pooch with a luxurious bath without spending more. Burt’s Bees Oatmeal Dog Shampoo costs $1.50 less on Amazon than at Target, but paying extra doesn’t make bath time any more luxurious. Price on Amazon: $6.49 Price at Target: $7.99 ©Courtesy of Amazon St. Ives Body Wash A 13.5-ounce bottle of pink lemon and mandarin orange-scented St. Ives Even & Bright Body Wash costs $1 less on Amazon than at Target. At first glance, this savings might not seem substantial, but it really adds up over the course of several bottles. It’s one of the smartest things to buy on Amazon because paying extra for the same product just doesn’t make sense.

MLive notes that among the changes coming to stores undergoing a remodel will be a lounge-like area for in-store pickup, the locations of which will move to the front of the store, more fresh and organic offerings, wider aisles and changed sightlines. Three markets in Michigan also will see the piloting of online grocery ordering for in-store pickup, the report said.

Its investment is going to the Closed Loop Fund, a $100 million social impact investment fund committed to funding comprehensive recycling infrastructure and programs in cities across the US. Nestlé Waters joins the ranks of companies like 3M, Coca-Cola, Colgate-Palmolive, Goldman Sachs, Johnson & Johnson, Keurig Green Mountain, PepsiCo and the PespiCo Foundation, Procter & Gamble, Unilever, Walmart, and the Walmart Foundation. The so-called recycling gap refers to the fact that, while 75% of the waste stream in the US is recyclable, just 30% actually gets recycled. In 2015, businesses and municipalities in the US spent over $5 billion disposing of waste in landfills. Much of this waste, such as PET plastic, is in demand among manufacturers as raw material for everything from textiles to packaging. In fact, major CPGs, in hoping to improve their recycled plastic packaging, can’t get their hands on enough recycled plastic, the NY Times reported when the Closed Loop Fund kicked off in 2015. The problem is the infrastructure: most recycling facilities aren’t able to collect, sort and process plastics and still turn a profit, according to the article. Nestle Waters’ chief sustainability officer Nelson Switzer says the company is aiming toward zero landfill waste in its products and operations. [Editor’s note: Switzer will be speaking at the Environmental Leader 2017 Conference in Denver, June 5-7.] Currently, the Closed Loop Fund has diverted more than 100,000 tons of recyclable content, and the 11 projects currently funded are poised to divert 4 million tons by 2025. In that same timeframe, the Fund aims to: Eliminate more than 40 million tons of greenhouse gas; Divert more than 20 million cumulative tons of waste from landfills; Provide a $40M economic benefit to municipalities; Prove replicable models that will help unlock additional investment in recycling. Last month, Nestlé Waters announced that 9 out of 10 of its Arrowhead Mountain Spring Water bottles incorporate 50% post-consumer recycled plastic content.  As a result, 1.8 billion bottles have been kept from landfills, and the 86 million pounds of recycled plastic has saved 69,660 tons of carbon emissions. In March, Nestlé Waters and Danone — the world’s two largest bottled water companies — said they were partnering to develop and launch at commercial scale a PET plastic bottle made from 100% bio-based material. Meanwhile, the Plastics Industry Association (PLASTICS) has launched a Sustainability Advisory Board. The goal of the board is to enlist a diverse group of plastics industry professionals to discuss and identify sustainability priorities in the plastics industry.   Categories EL Conference, Environmental Management, Feature, Manufacturing, WasteTags Nestle Waters, PET plastic, Recycling Environmental Leader Product and Project Awards 2016 Sponsored By: Environmental Leader    Approaches to Managing EHS&S Data Sponsored By: Enablon    Video: Expense & Data Management for Complex Payables Sponsored By: Ecova, Inc.    Financing Environmental Resiliency and a Low-Carbon Future with Green Bonds Sponsored By: NSF International    Leave a Comment Cancel reply NEWSLETTER NEWSLETTER SIGNUP Join 100,000+ subscribers who gain a competitive advantage with our news and analysis.

The recent report says the impact of significant reductions in retail workers may mirror the impact of manufacturing job losses that have taken place over the past decade. “Retail sales at brick-and-mortar stores, as well as margins on those sales, are increasingly constrained as consumers shift to online shopping,” noted the report from New York City-based Cornerstone. “At the same time, many parts of the country are experiencing upward structural wage pressure as concerns about income inequality are gaining political traction.” The report highlights that major retailers, including Macy’s, J.C. Penney, Kohl’s and Wal-Mart, have collectively closed hundreds of stores over the last few years in attempts to stem losses from unprofitable stores. “These headwinds are pushing retailers to rethink the traditional retail business model,” the report says. In the executive summary of the report, Cornerstone analysts Michael Shavel, Sebastian Vanderzeil and Emma Currier, said the retail landscape is experiencing unprecedented change in the face of disruptive forces, one of the most recent and powerful being the rapid rise of automation in the sector. Highlighting the World Economic Forum’s prediction that 30%-50% of retail jobs are at risk once known automation technologies are fully incorporated, the Cornerstone forecasters say this would result in the loss of about 6 million retail jobs and represents a greater percentage reduction than the manufacturing industry experienced. Cornerstone’s analysis also suggests that more than 7.5 million jobs are at high risk of computerization. A large proportion of the human capital represented by the retail workforce is therefore “at risk of becoming stranded workers,” the report says. RETAIL LOSSES COULD MIRROR MANUFACTURING DECLINE The eye-opening report from the Wall Street financial services firm also points to Bureau of Labor and Statistics data that retail employment exceeded total manufacturing employment in 2002, and now sits at about 16 million workers. Total manufacturing employment, which peaked in 1979 at approximately 19 million workers, has fallen to 12 million workers. “The repercussions of manufacturing’s decline, which was driven by automation and globalization, have been felt at the local and national levels,” the report stated. “For example, certain areas of the U.S. that were once manufacturing hubs have experienced rising poverty, declining populations, and erosion of political trust.” Cornerstone further predicts that the impact of significant reductions in retail workers may mirror the impact of manufacturing job losses. Retail sales at brick-and-mortar stores, as well as margins on those sales, are increasingly constrained as consumers shift to online shopping, the report says. “Retailers are investing in technology to build out their omni-channel platforms. In some cases, technology is complementing labor by providing a better customer experience,” Cornerstone says. “Indeed, this report argues that companies which use technology to support their workers are likely to benefit from long-term productivity gains. However, technology also has the potential to automate part of the sales process and render a range of jobs redundant. Taken together, store closures and automation technology have the potential to accelerate job losses in retail, an industry that employs approximately 10% of the total U.S. labor force.” DEPARTMENT STORE BLUES The Cornerstone report comes as several major retailers in real-time are struggling to adopt digital and mobile technology that keeps pace with online rivals that are profiting from consumer’s migration to e-commerce shopping portals. Last week Dillard, Macy’s and Kohl’s all missed first quarter earnings targets, citing online competition and declining sales at brick-and-mortar store locations. Macy’s stock sank to its lowest level since 2011 after the Cincinnati-based department store operator reported sales and profits were off target in the first quarter as more shoppers flee malls for cheaper offerings online and with discount rivals such as T.J. Maxx. The company announced plans to close 100 stores earlier this year. J.C. Penney Company and Sears Holdings Corp., two other department store chains that are mostly tied to mall assets, also have announced major downsizing efforts in the few months. In March, J.C. Penney announced plans to close 138 stores and cut over 5,000 jobs across the U.S. Those restructuring efforts included two Arkansas locations in Benton and Blytheville. On Sunday, Sears updated its restructuring program that included the closure of 108 Kmart and 42 of its namesake stores in order to realize cost savings of up $1.25 billion. The Hoffman Estate, Ill-based retail operator also recently sold off its Craftsman brand for $900 million and has received bids in excess of $700 million for over 60 separate real estate assets. Bentonville-based Wal-Mart Stores has also cut close to 1,000 jobs in Northwest Arkansas this calendar year. Those jobs came from several departments such as replenishment, Human Resources, Sam’s Club, technology and international positions in Bentonville. Wal-Mart has also increased its spending on boosting wages, enhanced training academies, online fulfillment capacity and enhanced technology capabilities to the tune of more than $4 billion in the past two years. The business restructuring is likely to continue as the retail sector grapples with omni-channel demands, analysts say. AMAZON EFFECT Cornerstone said its research identifies two key factors driving the automation conversation. First, e-commerce has grown significantly over the last five years and now accounts for more than 8% of total US retail sales. “Amazon has been a dominant force in e-commerce for years, and the company accounted for 43% of all online sales in 2016,” the report states. “While the consumer benefits from lower prices and greater price transparency, Amazon’s success is pressuring retailer profit margins as they fight to maintain market share and keep prices low to remain competitive.” Second, the report said a growing focus on income inequality and regulatory-driven minimum wage changes are a source of increasing wage pressure. Retail employs about 10% of the U.S. labor force, and research finds that retail workers are disproportionately represented among recipients of public assistance. “Retailers have been increasing wages recently due to a tighter labor market, but retail faces a structural issue of increasing pressure for minimum wage hikes at the local and state level,” the Cornerstone researchers said. “Taken together, retailers are facing structural price and cost issues that impact profitability and create meaningful long-term uncertainty. These headwinds will likely increase the industry’s propensity to automate, which would have significant impacts on existing labor.” The Cornerstone reports also looks at automation that retailers are now adopting, including mobile devices and proximity beacons, self- and automated-checkout, RFID technology, workforce and task management software, robots, smart tags and digital kiosks. The report also assesses how top retailers, including Amazon, Walmart, Target, Costco and Dollar General, are adapting to advancements in technology and automation.  The research highlights wage pressure and the “Amazon Effect” as Key drivers of retail automation. “Company announcements of store closures, labor force cuts, and technology investments are among the largest in recent memory. Investors should focus on key questions to better understand how a company is thinking about automation and labor from a strategic standpoint,” the report concludes.

Courtesy Walmart Several superstores in the region are part of a retailer’s plan to remodel a group of locations in the state. Walmart announced today an extensive, multi-million-dollar renovation plan for Michigan stores, as well as e-commerce upgrades. “2017 is going to be an exciting year for Walmart in Michigan, as we continue to focus on how to better serve our customers through innovation and investments,” said Jim Winkler, Michigan regional general manager, Walmart. “We’ve had a sharp focus on making our store experience second-to-none, and our customers are telling us that our plan is working.” The Arkansas-based retailer plans remodels at 12 locations throughout Michigan: Van Buren Township; Woodhaven; Hastings; Grand Blanc; Portage; Howell; Saginaw; Canton Township; Southgate; Saline; Benton Harbor; and Lansing. Improvements will be made throughout the stores for time-saving, convenience measures and interactive displays, said Anne Hatfield, director of communications, Walmart. Many of the upgrades will be to improve decision-making as well, Hatfield said. Last week, Walmart opened a new store in Whitehall, which features many of the updates being made to the 12 existing stores. Walmart Academy Walmart also plans to open three Walmart Academies in Owosso, Clinton Township and Kalamazoo. More than 200 academies are being built across the country to provide consistent training for Walmart staff, according to Hatfield. “We’re making sure we’re setting up folks to succeed and provide better customer service,” Hatfield said. “It lays out a clear path within the company. The opportunities are endless.” The Kalamazoo training center opens next week. Walmart The retailer said it spent more than $3 billion with Michigan suppliers in fiscal 2016. Walmart has nearly 4,000 stores worldwide.

Tech Apple Science Cars Samsung Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 Nintendo NES E3     Nintendo Switch Shows Up At Over 800 Target Stores Monday Morning Posted: May 22 2017, 8:21am CDT | by Luigi Lugmayr, in News | Technology News     Target receives new Nintendo Switch shipment. Updated. Target appears to have received a major shipment of the Nintendo Switch on Monday morning. The number of Target stores with Nintendo Switch in stock jumped to 843 stores, up 600 compared to Sunday, according to the Nintendo Switch inventory tracking data of iStockNow. T Don't Miss: Find Rare Products in Stock Online with The Tracker arget also offers online ordering with store pickup of the Nintendo Switch on target.com. More Target stores keep getting reported to have the Nintendo Switch in stock.  Last week major stores restocked the Nintendo Switch including Amazon, Best Buy and ToysRUs. Target did offer a Switch bundle last week, but not the console. Consumers who missed out on the Switch restocking event yesterday at Best Buy, can try Monday morning their local Target store. Another Switch sale that we know is coming is hosted by Walmart online. Walmart is expected to sell the Nintendo Switch again online at 5pm ET on Friday. Shoppers can get notified when the sale begins with The Tracker app. Our new Tracker app will also alert users about any online availability of the Switch at major retailer. Over 100 users scored the Nintendo Switch on Amazon last week, in the Prime member only sale. The Nintendo Switch reseller markups keep steady and range today between $91 to $100 for the Nintendo Switch with Gray Joy-Con and $99 to $130 for the Nintendo Switch with Neon Joy-Con on amazon.com. Getting a bundle from an official store makes sense as long as customers wanted to by the bundle games anyway.  Besides GameStop the only known online shop that sells the Nintendo Switch online is Walmart. The giant retailer is offering the Switch in flash sales on Fridays at 5pm ET. Download our new online stock tracker app The Tracker to get notified about new Nintendo Switch inventory. Nintendo is ramping up the production for the Nintendo Switch, but has not disclosed what the current production capacity per month is. The only number the company made official is the production volume over the next 12 months. 10 million Switch consoles are planned to enter retail channels until end of April 2018. The demand for the Nintendo Switch will spike during the Holiday Shopping season 2017. Nintendo will set aside a large part of the Switch production during the next months for November and December. This stock piling will keep the Nintendo Switch in short supply during the next 5 months. As Nintendo coordinated new Switch console shipment with the launch of Mario Kart 8, we expect the company to do the same for the next major Switch game launches. The big upcoming Switch games are Arms on June 16 and Splatoon 2 on July 21. Amazon offers pre-order discounts on both of the titles for Prime members to the tune of 20%. There are also several new accessories coming on the market from Nintendo in the next weeks. See the full list of new Nintendo Switch accessories. Updated: 2017-05-23 01:15:15am Offers Nintendo Switch with Neon Joy-Con Store: Best Buy Price: $299.99 Availability: Nintendo Switch with Neon Joy-Con Store: Target Price: $299.99 Availability: Nintendo Switch with Neon Joy-Con Store: Gamestop Price: $299.99 Availability: Browse all current Offers This story may contain affiliate links.

Waste360 Staff | May 22, 2017 Nestlé Waters North America is investing $6 million in the Closed Loop Fund, a $100 million social impact investment fund committed to finding a national solution to the critical recycling gap in the U.S. Nestlé Waters will join 3M, Coca-Cola, Colgate-Palmolive, Goldman Sachs, Johnson & Johnson, Keurig Green Mountain, PepsiCo and the PespiCo Foundation, Procter & Gamble, Unilever, Walmart and the Walmart Foundation in funding comprehensive recycling infrastructure and programs in cities across the U.S. “The United States has one of the lowest recycling rates of any industrialized country, but it doesn’t have to stay that way. The U.S. has an opportunity to lead the way in recycling, while creating jobs, economic growth and a more sustainable future,” said Nestlé Waters North America Chief Sustainability Officer Nelson Switzer in a statement. “As a company, we are on a very deliberate journey toward zero landfill waste in our products and operations, so I can think of no better opportunity than working collectively to ensure these recyclable materials are transformed from garbage to the valuable resources that they are.” To date, the Closed Loop Fund has diverted more than 100,000 tons of recyclables from landfill, and the 11 projects currently funded are expected to divert 4 million tons by 2025. The Closed Loop Fund is also working toward eliminating more than 40 million tons of greenhouse gas, diverting more than 20 million cumulative tons of waste from landfills, providing a $40 million economic benefit to municipalities and proving replicable models that will help unlock additional investment in recycling. "Nestlé Waters’ commitment to the Closed Loop Fund is a significant investment in creating shared value across the recycling supply chain," said Closed Loop Fund Managing Director Rob Kaplan. "The investment will enable people to recycle more, and efficiently turn those packages into new products. It will save taxpayer dollars and improve the recycling system." 0 comments Hide comments Comment * More information about text formats Text format CommentsPlain text Comments Allowed HTML tags: <em> <strong> <blockquote> <br> <p> Plain text No HTML tags allowed.

(Photo: Stephanie Koljonen/Facebook) 2276 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE WADENA, Minn. — Walmart shoppers in Minnesota got a real sense of the outdoors Tuesday night when a deer strolled into the store. Stephanie Koljonen, of Wadena, witnessed the commotion. "We were in the pet aisle when we heard what sounded like shelves falling, then a woman screaming," she said. "We rushed to help and that's when we saw a deer was on the loose." Koljonen says a fellow shopper swooped in and corralled the deer, gently holding it and covering its eyes so it wouldn't be spooked. That's when Koljonen grabbed her camera. She snapped a photo and shared it on Facebook. Her post now has more than 2,000 shares. Authorities later responded and freed the deer. Koljonen discovered the deer apparently strolled through motion-sensor doors in the Garden Center and eventually made its way into the aisles. No shoppers or deer were injured in the spectacle. <!--iframe--> More: Startling video shows sea lion drag little girl into water 2276 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2rKZisR

The CPSC is urging consumers to stop using the scooters immediately to prevent further injury. In the event the down tube cracks during use, a child or user may fall forward onto the broken tube, posing a laceration and penetration injury risk. The recall includes certain Krusher Push scooters that measure 30-inches in height and were sold in blue and have the brand name “Pulse Performance Products” printed on the down tube. The recalled scooters are marked with the factory code 083WY and item number 164257, and have the date code of 10-8-2016 or earlier printed on a label under the scooter deck. According to the scooter recall, an estimated 18,700 units were distributed for sale throughout the United States. The scooters were manufactured in China by Pulse Performance Products, a division of Bravo Sports, of Sante Fe Springs, California. They were sold at Walmart and Westminster Trading stores nationwide and online at Walmart.com from June 2016 through May 2017 for around $40.00. The CPSC recommends that customers stop using the recalled scooters and contact Pulse Performance toll-free at 844-728-9957 or visit them online at www.pulsescooters.com and navigate to the “CPSC Safety Recall” link for information on how to receive a full refund.

View All Posts Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE:WMT) — This, the largest retailer in the world with over 10,000 discount department stores, wholesale clubs, supermarkets and supercenters, has successfully fought to maintain its position in a highly competitive environment. Last Thursday, CFRA (S&P Global) issued a stock report in which it kept a “Five-Star Strong Buy” rating on the stock while increasing the 12-month target to $87 from $81 and their fiscal year 2018 (Jan.) earnings per share to $4.36, up from $4.30. The increase was the result of WMT’s April quarterly result of $1, which beat S&P’s estimate by 5 cents. They pointed out that comparable store sales growth of 1.4% was driven mainly by food sales and “U.S. e-commerce sales growth of 63% was driven by a 5X increase in assortment and faster delivery offering.” In October 2015, the board approved a $20 billion share buyback plan. As of May ’17 $7 billion remained to be completed. WMT pays an annual dividend of $2.04 for a dividend yield of 2.6%. Early in April, WMT stock broke a 10-month resistance line at $73, advancing to about $77 before retreating to about $75 last Wednesday. Several major research firms increased both earnings and price targets, and on Thursday the stock broke to a new high, which was followed by another advance on Friday. WMT stock is, however, still shy of its all-time high of $91 made in January ’15 but appears destined to test that high. Thus traders should try to buy this blue-chip member of the Dow Jones Industrial Average at $78 for a target of $88 and a proposed return of almost 13%.

At Friday’s closing bell, both major indices ended the week with a modest loss of 0.4%. On Friday, both the Dow Jones and the S&P 500 rose 0.7% while the Nasdaq and the Russell 2000 gained 0.5%. The climb back up was led by the industrials (+1.4%), energy (+1.2%) and financials (+0.8%). Crude oil boosted an advance in the energy sector as WTI jumped 2% to $50.33 per barrel. The jump followed a statement by Russia and Saudi Arabia that there was a possibility of both extending the time frame of a cut in crude production but also increasing the size of the cut itself. At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 142 points at 20,805; the S&P 500 gained 16 points to close at 2,382; the Nasdaq closed at 6,084 for a gain of 29 points; and the Russell 2000 rose 6 points at 1,367. The NYSE’s primary exchange traded over 1 billion shares with total volume of 3.8 billion shares, and Nasdaq crossed 1.9 billion shares. On the Big Board, advancers led decliners by 3-to-1, and on the Nasdaq, advancers led by 1.8-to-1. Blocks on the NYSE fell to 7,598 from 8,345 on Thursday. Click to Enlarge Stocks have become volatile following a period of lower-than-average volume for three months, and almost a record low reading on the VIX (Fear Index). Then on Wednesday that pattern was broken with a sell-off that broke the first levels of support of many of the “most-watched” indices. But on Thursday the indices reversed, led by the S&P 500’s positive intraday action. On Friday bargain-hunting continued, and the index closed above its 50-day moving average at 2,370. But volume on the S&P 500 is still relatively low compared to Wednesday’s high volume sell-off, and MACD hardly budged from Wednesday’s low reading. Conclusion: Despite Thursday’s reversal and a modest follow-through on Friday, the pressure is still on the bulls to bring in buyers that will conclusively drive the major indices to new highs. Friday’s breadth, at a positive 3-to-1, is an acceptable indicator for the reversal of a minor breakdown, but a major break demands positive breadth of 5-to-1 or more to drive through to new highs. Buyers should stick with high-quality stocks with relatively low volatility. My Trade of the Day, Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE:WMT) is a big-cap, blue chip that almost demands attention from buyers, but only at the right price.

The surveillance footage, released by the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office on Wednesday, shows Michael Foster, 43, tackling Clarence Daniels from behind as he was walking into a Brandon, Fla. Wal-Mart on Tuesday. Foster followed Daniels into the store after seeing him exiting his vehicle with a gun holstered under his shirt — which was perfectly legal for the 62-year-old Daniels to do since he holds a concealed weapon license. Nevertheless, Foster tackled Daniels from behind as he entered the store, and put him in a chokehold before taking him to the ground. Witnesses said that Foster yelled out that Daniels had a gun. They also said that Daniels yelled out that he had a license for it. Foster called 911 only after he tackled accosted Daniels. He was arrested and charged with battery.

(Fairfax County Police) By Dana Hedgpeth By Dana Hedgpeth May 22 at 8:01 AM Follow @postmetrogirl A man fled a Walmart store after being accused of trying to record images under the dresses of a 10-year-old girl and her mother in the Fairfax area, police said. The “upskirting” incident happened around 11 a.m. May 14 at the store on Burke Commons Road in Burke. Police said the man used a “recording device” to “unlawfully record up the dresses of a 10-year-old girl and a 36-year-old woman.” When the child’s mother confronted the man, he left the store before law enforcement arrived. He fled the parking lot in a silver or gray Honda Crosstour or a vehicle that looks similar. A photo from a surveillance camera shows the man who is believed to be involved, according to police. He was wearing a black hat with an Adidas logo, black pants, a black, polo-style shirt and dark shoes at the time of the incident. He is described as white and roughly 40 years old. He is about 6 feet tall and weighs 175 pounds.

Tech Apple Science Cars Samsung Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 Nintendo NES E3     New Nintendo Switch Starter Bundles Don't Break The Bank Posted: May 22 2017, 7:51am CDT | by Luigi Lugmayr, Updated: May 23 2017, 1:46am CDT, in News | Technology News     Video game retailer GameStop launched two low priced Nintendo Switch bundles. Last week new Nintendo Switch inventory arrived in stores. Amazon, Best Buy and ToysRUs had big Switch sales events. This week the availability of the Nintendo Switch is expected to be limited again. Don't Miss: Find Rare Products in Stock Online with The Tracker Update May 23: GameStop just dropped the prices of their Nintendo Switch bundles even further. The two new Nintendo Switch Bundles sell for less than $400. These bundles will sell out quickly. GameStop is the only place to find the Nintendo Switch in stock online. GameStop has been selling Switch bundles online for the past weeks. Every couple days GameStop changes the Switch bundles. The currently available Nintendo Switch bundles are the lowest priced since a long time. The Nintendo Switch Gray Joy-Con Zelda Starter Bundle is on sale for $432.99 and includes the Nintendo Switch Console with Gray Joy-Con, Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild (Physical Game), Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Expansion Pass (Digital Download), Has-Been Heroes (Digital Game), Snipperclips (Digital Game), and the Nintendo Switch ZAGG Invisible Shield One Screen Protector.  The Nintendo Switch Neon Joy-Con Mario Kart Starter Bundle, selling for the same $432.99 price includes Nintendo Switch Console with Neon Red and Blue Joy-Con, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe (Physical Game), Nintendo Switch ZAGG Invisible Shield One Screen Protector, Nintendo Switch Racing Wheel 2 Pack, Has-Been Heroes (Digital Game), and Shovel Knight: Treasure Trove (Digital Game). The digital game downloads are the only thing that are not essential buys for Nintendo Switch owners. Each bundle contains a must-have Switch game the essential screen protector almost all Switch owners are getting. The bundle price is only about $40 above what reseller charge on amazon.com for the console. GameStop will ship the new Nintendo Switch starter bundles on June 2nd. A Switch sale that we know is coming up this week is hosted by Walmart. Walmart is expected to sell the Nintendo Switch again online at 5pm ET on Friday. Shoppers can get notified when the sale begins with The Tracker app.  The Nintendo Switch reseller markups keep steady and range today between $91 to $100 for the Nintendo Switch with Gray Joy-Con and $99 to $130 for the Nintendo Switch with Neon Joy-Con on amazon.com. Getting a bundle from an official store makes sense as long as customers wanted to by the bundle games anyway. Our new online inventory tracker app, The Tracker, will send a notification when the Nintendo Switch is spotted in stock at major online retailers including Amazon.com. Nintendo is ramping up the production for the Nintendo Switch, but has not disclosed what the current production capacity per month is. The only number the company made official is the production volume over the next 12 months. 10 million Switch consoles are planned to enter retail channels until end of April 2018. The demand for the Nintendo Switch will spike during the Holiday Shopping season 2017. Nintendo will set aside a large part of the Switch production during the next months for November and December. This stock piling will keep the Nintendo Switch in short supply during the next 5 months. As Nintendo coordinated new Switch console shipment with the launch of Mario Kart 8, we expect the company to do the same for the next major Switch game launches. The big upcoming Switch games are Arms on June 16 and Splatoon 2 on July 21. Amazon offers pre-order discounts on both of the titles for Prime members to the tune of 20%. There are also several new accessories coming on the market from Nintendo in the next weeks. See the full list of new Nintendo Switch accessories.

The surveillance footage, released by the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office on Wednesday, shows Michael Foster, 43, tackling Clarence Daniels from behind as he was walking into a Brandon, Fla. Wal-Mart on Tuesday. Foster followed Daniels into the store after seeing him exiting his vehicle with a gun holstered under his shirt — which was perfectly legal for the 62-year-old Daniels to do since he holds a concealed weapon license. Nevertheless, Foster tackled Daniels from behind as he entered the store, and put him in a chokehold before taking him to the ground. Witnesses said that Foster yelled out that Daniels had a gun. They also said that Daniels yelled out that he had a license for it. Foster called 911 only after he tackled accosted Daniels. He was arrested and charged with battery.

Here is my story about when I joined, why I think it's a great site for making a little extra money and how I earn free gift cards to places like Amazon, Target, Walmart, Starbucks, CVS and more. I joined Swagbucks in October 2010 because a couponing friend recommended the site. I had been writing this Smart Shopper blog for about a year when she posted about Swagbucks on the blog. I was skeptical at first because she said she was earning gift cards every month just by doing the internet searches she usually did, watching videos, taking surveys, doing online shopping through their shopping portal and more. I tried it out for a few weeks and was surprised at how many SB points I had earned by doing the things I mentioned above. Keep in mind that I am a blogger so I am on the computer 8 hours a day or more so it's easier for me to earn Swagbucks from my desktop than people who are not on the computer as much as I am. But even if you only spend a little time on the computer, you can still score gift cards every month. And the good news is that they also have a mobile app and multiple mobile video apps that you can download to earn Swagbucks when you not on a desktop. I now earn about $25 - $30 per month in gift cards or Paypal doing searches, watching videos, taking surveys, making my online purchases through their online shopping portal, taking the daily poll and entering the daily Swagbucks code and more. That's over $300 per year for doing easy things online. If you have more time for surveys or do more online shopping, you can easily earn more. I usually cash out my points for gift cards to Paypal (which can be transferred to your bank so it's like getting paid in cash), CVS (who doesn't love free toilet paper, right?!), various gas stations and Starbucks (special treat for my teens every once in a while). New Member Sign-Up Bonus: If you have not signed up get, new members get a SB bonus when you sign up at Swagbucks.com HERE. To get the bonus SB points, click the text that reads "I have a sign up code" during registration and then enter the code: SMARTSHOPPER to get the bonus. Make sure you use all caps since it is case sensitive. Read on to see exactly how I earn those SB points so I can cash them in for gift cards. How to Earn SB Points * Search online: Each time you need to search for something online, use the Swagbucks search engine on their website (instead of Google). I actually have the Swagbucks toolbar installed on my desktop and it places a search box right on my screen making it super easy to search. Every once in a while, they award SB points just for doing the searches I used to do using Google. * Take surveys on their website * Answer the daily poll * Watch videos through their website or multiple mobile apps * Use their online shopping portal (I do most of my online shopping at major retailers who are part of the Swagbucks Shop and Earn program (like Amazon.com, Kohls.com, Target.com, Walmart.com and more) and earn Swagbucks every time I shop. Recently, I was credited with 562 SB points (worth $5.62 in gift cards) for an online purchase I made at Kohls.com. * Play games * Participate in special Swag Code events (which I post about on the blog) * Enter the daily Swag Code (which we usually let you know about here on the blog each day). Swagbucks posts bonus codes on their Facebook, Twitter and blog pages each day. If you have the Swagbucks Mobile App, it will buzz when there is a new code. When the code becomes available each day, one of us posts it here on the blog so we can all get it. The codes are only valid for an hour usually. Once you get the code, you then copy and paste the code into the Swag Code box at the top of the homepage of Swagbucks.com. Look for the circle with the words Swag Code next to it. New member bonus Swagbucks sign-up code! As I posted above, new members get a 70 SB bonus when you sign up HERE. To get the bonus SB points, click the text that reads "I have a sign up code" during registration and then enter the code: SMARTSHOPPER to get the bonus. Make sure you use all caps since it is case sensitive. Disclaimer: This post contains affiliate links and I appreciate your using them!

And I agree - some days I have time to do more than others but I earn at least some SB points every day. And a new SWAGO game starts today with a new Spin & Win option that looks like fun! QUOTE Report as abuse ascherer May 22, 12:30 a.m. I love Swagbucks and thank you for getting me started. I normally get gift cards to Lowes Home Improvement (a homeowner always needs something from there) and restaurants (it makes eating out more affordable). Some days I do a lot and some days it is just a little but I try to do some everyday. Thanks for the nudge in the right direction. QUOTE Report as abuse Faye Prosser -WRAL Smart Shopper May 21, 10:06 p.m. vlynn - I agree with you completely. It's pretty easy to reach the $25 mark every month or 2. As I sit here blogging, I am running videos on the SBTV app on my phone and earning super easy SB points. Thanks for your feedback! QUOTE Report as abuse vlynn May 21, 9:32 p.m. The neat thing about swagbucks is that you can do a little or a lot.

May 15, 2017 (Photo: Alton Strupp/CJ) They call her “Lefty.” She’s a senior softball star for Lanesville High School, team captain three years running. A leadoff hitter, she bats a shade under .600 with a slugging percentage north of .750 and an on-base clip of .670. She leads the Eagles in more than 10 statistical categories. But that’s just the start. She’s even more impressive in person. The standout is a natural in the batter’s box, her vision sharp as a ball slipped outside the strike zone to spur a leadoff walk-on senior night this past Monday. Three pitches later, she raced home after two stolen bases and a play at the plate, the tone-setter in a 15-1, five-inning Lanesville win. The Eagles’ seniors were substituted one-by-one as the final half-inning began, each showered with cheers from the home crowd. Last came Lanesville’s “Lefty.” As she made her way from center field to the dugout, the applause grew considerably – for good reason. Her name is Katelyn Pavey. Her journey has thus far culminated in a successful high school career and a chance to play at the next level, but it’s been anything but usual. Pavey was born with phocomelia, a rare birth defect characterized by underdeveloped or absent limbs. She has half a left arm with two digits just below the elbow. But you’d hardly know it. “I don’t see myself as having a disability,” Pavey said. “Disability is ability, I believe. I believe I can do anything anyone else can.” Pavey uses her left arm to pull her glove off of her right hand as she retrieves the ball to throw in to the infield. She has been timed and only lacks .2 seconds from others players at making the transition from ball to hand. May 15, 2017 (Photo: Alton Strupp/CJ) She’s not wrong. Pavey’s throwing transition is less than a quarter of a second slower than any other player’s method. She catches with her right, takes the glove off with her half arm and switches back to throw with the right. A left-handed hitter, she chokes the bat with her right hand and steadies it with her half arm at the plate. She made the switch from righty at an early age for more control. Pavey leads the Eagles in hits (44), runs (34), stolen bases (40 in 43 attempts), RBIs (20) and walks (18), for starters, and has 42 putouts in 47 chances. She hit her first home run on May 3, a straight shot over the center-field fence. Pavey’s father, Eric, a second-year head coach at Lanesville, said his daughter’s talent is well earned. “They see the product on the field, but they don’t see the amount of hours being put in behind the scenes and the amount of hours she has practicing,” Eric said. “For example, last Friday, I gave the girls off, but she came down here and hit for two and a half hours on her own. … People don’t see that. I think what makes me the most proud is she’s had the dedication to get better. She’s never let it stop her.” Katelyn was impressing Eric before she could even walk, he said. At two years old, she was catching foam fly balls. It wasn’t long before she owned her first glove. “I dropped it and she caught it,” Eric said. “ … I dropped the ball again and she caught it again. So I went out, after she could sit up, and bought a glove from Wal-Mart, one of those Velcro gloves. We started throwing it to her, and she’d catch it.” Eric has coached Katelyn the majority of her career, including her tee-ball years and the past two seasons at Lanesville. His father, David, has coached alongside Eric during his stint with the Eagles. David, along with Eric’s brother, Darren, received major-league interest during their baseball playing days. Also a former quarterback, Darren was a standout catcher for New Albany in the late 1980s. He still holds the record for all-time putouts. “Three generations on one field, that’s a blessing to have,” Katelyn said. “It’s so cool to play with a family that knows how to play ball and have fun. Everyone is supporting you.” Not every coach along the way has been as accepting, though, Eric said. Katelyn tried out for and played under different coaches during four years of travel ball, some less open-minded than others. “We’ve been told no a few times,” Eric said. “It motivated me to work her harder, and it motivated her to work even harder.” Pavey warms up before a game. Photo: Alton Strupp/CJ) As a result, Katelyn runs with opportunity when given the chance. She went viral in 2015 for her bat-trick emulation video, which helped pave the way for her work at the NubAbility Athletics Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to coaching kids with limb loss. After the video made its way around the Internet, Katelyn was invited to coach at the foundation’s camps. Also a basketball player at Lanesville, she coaches softball, hoops and volleyball at the annual camps, which take place in Illinois every July, in addition to regional events recently in Florida and Tennessee, she said. Katelyn’s camera roll is filled with photos and videos of children she has positively influenced. Four-by-six-inch print-outs are arranged on her senior night poster board, one of a boy with no arms. She taught him how to hit. “It’s amazing to see what she can do,” teammate Katelyn Hurley said. “Honestly, she makes me want to become better, like I look up to her.” A role model to many already, Katelyn hopes to become a motivational speaker and college softball coach after her playing days, which will extend beyond high school. Katelyn signed on with Cincinnati Christian University in November of last year. CCU watched Katelyn play at a camp in Brandenburg, Ky. – put on by the late Vernon Bibb – as a sophomore, and the program showed interest from the get-go, she said. Eric said he plans to collaborate with an author on a pair of biographies for Katelyn, one focused on her high school life – from tying her shoes and fixing her hair to how to swing a bat – with a follow-up on her college career. The working title: “Life Lessons from Lefty.” “I think God’s given her a platform to show others that you don’t need two (arms) and to show others that it’s possible if you put in the work and you want to play,” Eric said. “… She’s started to grow in her faith and – what I call – own her arm. … She owns it to where people come up to her after games and come up to her after travel ball tournaments and talk to her and tell her what kind of an inspiration she is to them.” Adjacent to Katelyn’s senior night poster board and photo collection sat a framed letter titled, “Go. Play. Catch.” The letter was from Eric, thanking Katelyn for her commitment to the game, especially at a young age. “Your smile grew bigger and bigger,” the letter read, “and each year you played, you got better and better, and your love for the game and your determination and willingness to succeed grew right along with your jersey size.” She’s fulfilled her lifelong dream of playing in college, she’s solidified herself as an all-area performer, but above all else, she said, she’s inspired the lives of those around her. They call her “Lefty.” “At first, I didn’t expect to be that inspiration,” Katelyn said. “I didn’t own it, that I had one arm. I was kind of backwards and shy at the beginning. Once I grew older and learned about NubAbility and learned how to become an inspiration, then I saw I can do stuff, and I can help inspire people. That’s what I want to do.” Katelyn pavey, softball, News 56 shares share tweet sms send email Related News 188 shares5w ago News Ind. softball star making history and doesn't even know it 01 Apr News Roundup: Providence run-rules two on road 561 shares21 Apr Video The story behind N.J. softball player's amazing behind-the-back hit Latest reply 33 shares 9hr 23 Preseason ALL-USA Girls Lacrosse players selected for Under Armour All-America Game May 22, 2017 · USA TODAY High School Sports reply 298 shares 9hr 15-year-old kicker out to take Guinness World Record from 4-time Super Bowl champion May 22, 2017 · Josh Barnett, USA TODAY High School Sports reply 181 shares 9hr 26 Preseason ALL-USA Boys Lacrosse players selected to Under Armour All-America Game May 22, 2017 · USA TODAY High School Sports reply 65 shares 10hr ALL-USA watch: Outfielder Drew Waters helps Etowah reach state finals May 22, 2017 · Jim Halley, USA TODAY High School Sports reply 20 shares 13hr VIDEO: This middle school teacher in a pink tutu brutally embarrasses a student in end of year teacher-student game May 22, 2017 · Cam Smith, USA TODAY High School Sports 13hr How Florida State's recruiting success has led to NFL draft success May 22, 2017 · Tallahassee Democrat reply 19 shares 13hr ALL-USA Watch: Record-setting Livy Schiele loving her life in softball May 22, 2017 · Josh Barnett, USA TODAY High School Sports reply 717 shares 14hr Ga. baseball team who lost game after rare, controversial call wins appeal May 22, 2017 · Alec McQuade, 11Alive Sports 14hr Final two events of Ky. track and field championships cancelled after lengthy weather delay May 22, 2017 · Cam Smith, USA TODAY High School Sports reply 53 shares 15hr No. 3 Culver Academy boys lacrosse wins prestigious Inter-Ac Invitational May 22, 2017 · USA TODAY High School Sports More USA Today High School Sports MOST POPULAR 1d 254 shares Southern Jam Fest: Former Arkansas star Stefan Welsh is very hands on as coach May 21, 2016 06 Mar 323 shares Oregon wrestling coach allegedly encouraged teen's bullying, shoved shoe with dog feces in his face March 6, 2017 02 Feb 3.6k shares ALL-USA Watch: Chino Hills star LiAngelo Ball motivated by not making McDonald's All American Game February 2, 2017 17 Feb 124 shares La. football coach who banned Alabama coaches from campus fired by school February 17, 2017 2w 922 shares Three Super 25 teams set for GEICO High School Lacrosse Nationals May 11, 2017 Feedback Privacy Notice/Your California Privacy Rights Terms of Service Ad Choices Frequently Asked Questions Community Rules Poll and Voting Rules Powered by WordPress.com VIP More Information Home Follow us… HOME USA TODAY High School Sports High School Football America Texas HS Football Florida HS Football Gridiron New Jersey Prep Circuit Scores Super 25 - Baseball Super 25 - Football National - Football Super 25 - Boys Basketball Super 25 - Girls Basketball National - Basketball Features ALL-USA Score Predictor Super 25 Jordan Brand Classic McDonald's All American Games National Signing Day U.S. Army All-American Bowl Under Armour All-America Game NATA Sports Safety Achieving The Dream Spalding Hoophall Classic Celeb Chop-Up Athlete Look Back Girls Sports Month Blogs McDonald's All American Game Hometown Heroes Jordan Brand Classic Senior Night Outside The Box Recruiting Under Armour All-America Selection Tour U.S. Army All-American Selection Tour Athlete Blogs Rankings Baseball - Expert Baseball - Computer Softball Boys Lacrosse - Expert Boys Lacrosse - Computer Girls Lacrosse - Expert Girls Lacrosse - Computer Boys Soccer - Spring Girls Soccer - Spring Boys Basketball - Expert Boys Basketball - Computer Girls Basketball - Expert Girls Basketball - Computer Wrestling Boys Soccer - Winter Girls Soccer - Winter Football - Expert Football - Computer Volleyball Boys Soccer - Fall Girls Soccer - Fall Video/Photos Video Photos Store Coach Signup Feedback Privacy Notice/Your California Privacy Rights Terms of Service Ad Choices Frequently Asked Questions Community Rules Poll and Voting Rules Powered by WordPress.com VIP Post to Cancel

Promote your Business on Economictimes.com for free and reach out to millions of potential Customers List Your Business Find Service Near You Once a staunch opposer of FDI in multi-brand retail, the Narendra Modi government is now considering the bold step of opening up the sector to 100% FDI for brick and mortar stores as well as to sell online but with many riders. Retailers may only be allowed to sell goods manufactured in India, of which 30% may have to be sourced from MSMEs. Thus global retailers like Wal-Mart and Amazon maybe allowed to bring in 100% FDI provided they sell no imported goods. A minimum employee roll of 1000 could be another rider according to a senior government official. Sources say another likely caveat is a minimum capitalisation of $100mn with 50% being made mandatory to invest in the back end infrastructure. The current norm of allowing such supermarkets and hypermarkets in cities with a population of more than 1mn is likely to be done away with. The rationale behind all these riders is to give a major leg up to manufacturing and boost and boost job creation. Also, the ban on selling imported goods will help the government counter any possible backlashes with the opposition and trade unions. Interestingly, opening up the retail sector will be a result of allowing foreign retailers to sell multi branded goods produced in India. It will not be liberalised explicitly as under the "retail sector" in the FDI policy. "India is wooing investors worldwide to Make In India. But current regulations do not permit them to fully own the stores to sell in India. That is a major anomaly in the Make In India initiative," said an official involved in the drafting of this bold reform. This government has already exercised such a model in the foods category. Last year it allowed 100% FDI in food trading provided all of the goods were produced domestically.

Updated 3 hours ago The Pittsburgh Foundation is narrowing the focus of its former Day of Giving fundraiser to raise money for more than 100 nonprofits in Allegheny and Westmoreland counties that directly support people with needs in five areas. The foundation said this year's Critical Needs Alert event begins at 8 a.m. Tuesday and will last 16 hours. “The shift (from a general fundraising event) aims to support the safety net for basic needs and respond to the needs of our community,” said Kelly Uranker, the Pittsburgh Foundation's director of the Center for Philanthropy. “We want everyone to benefit from the prosperity that has occurred in the region over the last couple years,” Uranker said. In the past, the former Day of Giving event benefited a wider array of nonprofits across the region. The Pittsburgh Foundation was forced to reschedule last year's event after a glitch with its online fundraising platform caused problems about 10 hours into the daylong campaign. More than 820 nonprofits participated in the rescheduled event last September. The Critical Needs Alert event will support organizations that help people with needs related to child care, food and nutrition, physical and mental health, housing and transportation. Participating organizations include family health care centers, local YMCAs, women's centers, soup kitchens and transportation-service organizations such as the Braddock-based Heritage Community Initiatives. Uranker said the new event aligns with the foundation's “100 Percent Pittsburgh” principle, which aims to support the one-third of the region's population that falls below the poverty line and allows them to benefit from the region's improving economy. Mt. Ararat Community Activity Center, one of this year's participating nonprofits, helps provide childcare to children up to age 5. The center hopes to use money they receive from this year's fundraiser to open a larger childcare facility. “We hope that by moving to a larger facility, we will eliminate our waiting list and provide childcare to others in the community, beyond our own waiting list,” said Denise Williams, Mt. Ararat's executive director. “The funding we will gain from this Critical Needs Alert will be extremely beneficial as these are critical years for our children.” The Pittsburgh Foundation has allocated up to $657,000 to match funds raised by the participating foundations. For example, if all the groups collected a combined $600,000, the matching funds would bring the total amount raised to $1.2 million. To donate, people should visit PittsburghGives.org between 8 a.m. and midnight Tuesday. There is a minimum donation of $25. Emma Curtis is a Tribune-Review staff writer.

 The carnage in retail is good news, but only if you know where to look Akin Oyedele May 22, 2017, 11:25 AM 2,338 facebook linkedin twitter email print Carl Court/Getty A handful of industries and companies are defying the downturn in retail as consumers move online to buy things. They don't include apparel retailers like Macy's and TJX, which disappointed on first-quarter earnings. But Walmart, America's largest brick-and-mortar retailer, proved resilient partly because it invested heavily in beefing up its online operation, including with its $3 billion acquisition of Jet.com. The e-commerce threat is a common thread for many of the companies that are likely to close stores — more than 3,000 closings are expected this year — and in turn lay off workers. But the changes in behavior that have slammed some of the big players in traditional retail could boost other parts of the consumer discretionary sector. "Headwinds remain for some particular industries (autos, publishing, some retailers) within discretionary, but we are cautiously optimistic that the overall group should continue to move higher, possibly at a slower rate near-term," Lindsey Bell, an investment strategist at CFRA, said in a recent note. "Stock pickers, however, will likely benefit the most." Some recent surveys, conducted by firms including TD Bank and JPMorgan Chase, found that millennials are spending more on experiences. For Sebastian Werner, a portfolio manager for US and global growth equities at Deutsche Asset Management, companies that offer experiences over items are likely to outperform in this environment. The beauty industry is doing fairly well, Werner said. He gave Ulta Beauty as an example that combines physical cosmetics sales with the experience of a makeover. Its shares have gained 42% over the past year. Werner and other investors have pointed to home improvement as another niche that's withstanding the broader weakness in retail. Floor & Decor, which went public in late April and has gained 13% since then, is "proof that this is a retail concept that might work in an environment that doesn't have the overhang from Amazon," Werner said. That's because of the "touch-and-feel" nature of tiles and other home-improvement supplies. Buyers also often prefer to get in-person advice from a professional at a store. Those trends also put gardening retailers in a good spot in this market environment. "If you're working on your garden now, you don't want to wait until the UPS car drives to your home in two days," Werner said. "You just drive to the store." Tractor Supply is one of Werner's preferred companies in this space, though its exposure to oil-producing markets has hurt its performance as the commodity's price fell and workers lost their jobs. Another area that stands to benefit from consumers spending more on experiences is travel, specifically cruise lines, Werner told Business Insider. "Most people that have gone on a cruise don't do it only once, but they become repetitive users," he said. "They get hooked on the experience, usually." He said cruise lines were smart about ways to upsell customers with upgrades like a room with a sea view. China's booming cruise industry also offers opportunities for investors, as well as the recent opening up of Cuba for tourists. Though Cuba still needs to upgrade its infrastructure, it offers opportunities for investors who are looking out to the long term, Werner said. To be involved in consumer discretionary, "you need some concepts that are somewhat differentiated and that are isolated by this e-commerce thing," Werner added.

Asit Ranjan Mishra The Narendra Modi govt is considering allowing 100% FDI in multi-brand retail as long as the products are made in India—in an attempt to promote Make In India with job creation at its core. Photo: Aniruddha Chowdhury/Mint New Delhi: To promote its flagship Make In India scheme with job creation at its core, the Narendra Modi government is considering allowing 100% foreign direct investment (FDI) in multi-brand retail—as long as the products are made in India. A government official familiar with the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the proposal is being considered. “A final decision on the matter will be taken after wider consultation,” he added. The policy is unlikely to be termed “FDI in multi-brand retail” as the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is opposed to the idea and had promised in its 2014 election manifesto to not allow this. Click here for enlarge In 2012, the then Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government allowed 51% FDI in multi-brand retail (supermarkets and the like) in some cities, subject to the approval of state governments. When it came to power in 2014, the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance government put the policy on ice without a formal notification. The current proposal by the government, if implemented, is expected to be vastly different from the UPA policy as it will not allow imported items to be sold by multinational supermarket chains such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. However, it is likely to do away with city-specific and sourcing restrictions put by the UPA government. The UPA had restricted such supermarkets to cities with population in excess of 1 million and mandated that they source 30% of their products from small and medium enterprises. An executive at a large retail chain, who asked that neither he nor his firm be identified, said the policy being considered would make sense for foreign supermarket chains, though local supermarkets would still have an advantage in terms of providing more choice to consumers as they are allowed to sell imported items as well. The proposal may also help Prime Minister Narendra Modi meet his target of doubling income of farmers by 2022. In parallel, the government is considering allowing foreign food retailers to sell 25% non-food items of the total items sold to enable 100% FDI in food retail chains. Foreign supermarket chains have pointed out that opening food retail chains does not make sense as the profit margin in such businesses is thin, and the food processing ministry which is spearheading the proposal has recommended allowing some non-food items to be sold in such stores to make the model viable. Akash Gupt, partner at PwC India, said the proposal to link foreign investment in retail to local manufacturing and sourcing makes sense as it will create manufacturing capacity in the country. “Multinational hypermarkets may be interested in opening stores in India under the model since they don’t rely a lot on imports and mostly depend on local supplies,” he added. In April, commerce minister Nirmala Sitharaman informed Parliament that the government is not rethinking its opposition to FDI in multi-brand retail. In July, the cabinet allowed all companies, including Indian supermarkets, to tap the equity market to raise foreign portfolio investment up to 49% without seeking the finance ministry’s approval. By 2020, India’s retail sector is expected to double to $1.1-1.2 trillion from $630 billion in 2015 at a compound annual growth rate of 12%, said a report released by lobby group Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry and PwC in September last year. Backed by robust economic growth and rising household incomes, consumer spending in India is also expected to touch $3.6 trillion (about Rs230 trillion) by 2020, increasing India’s share in global consumption to 5.8%, more than twice its current levels, the report added.

The BSE consumer durables index and BSE consumer discretionary goods and services index are trading at 57.70 times and 35.80 times expected earnings for 2017-18 respectively. Meanwhile, shares of public sector banks were among big losers on Monday with losses as high as 11%. Here's a look at eight macro-economic triggers that are likely to impact the market today RBI's NPA action The RBI will increase the number of members in the oversight committee which presides over the restructuring proposals and also expand the scope of the committee beyond the so-called scheme for sustainable structuring of stressed assets (S4A), the central bank said in its action plan to implement the Banking Regulation (Amendment) Ordinance, 2017. However, the central bank delayed the decision on which cases will be taken to the bankruptcy courts, instead saying that it will constitute a panel comprising mostly of its independent board members to advice in the matter. RBI is stepping cautiously and ensuring that any decision taken is not unilateral. The recently promulgated Banking Regulation (Amendment) Ordinance does not change the status quo. Good money contnues to be thrown after bad and no real resolution of NPAs is taking place. Made in India, sold by MNC supermarkets The Narendra Modi government is considering allowing 100% foreign direct investment (FDI) in multi-brand retail—as long as the products are made in India, reported a business paper. A final decision on the matter will be taken after wider consultation. The policy is unlikely to be termed “FDI in multi-brand retail” as the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is opposed to the idea and had promised in its 2014 election manifesto to not allow this. The current proposal by the government, if implemented, will not allow imported items to be sold by multinational supermarket chains such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. However, it is likely to do away with city-specific and sourcing restrictions put by the UPA government earlier. Local supermarkets would still have an advantage in terms of providing more choice to consumers as they are allowed to sell imported items as well. The idea is definitely original but do we really need more supermarket chains? CV sales set for a bad quarter Commercial vehicle (CVs) sales fell to the lowest in nearly seven and a half years in April, after a buying spree and overstocking in March ahead of a change in emission standards and the resultant price hike affected demand the following month. Top manufacturers were also hit by component shortages. Commercial vehicle sales fell 23% in April to 41,490 units, the lowest since November 2009, when the volume was 40,855 units. Medium and heavy trucks posted a whopping 59% drop in sales to 8,194 units in April, while including buses, the decline was almost 55%. An expansion in small commercial vehicles and pickup in trucks slightly offset the overall impact. M&HCV volumes are likely to gain momentum post the first quarter as customers will take some time to get accustomed with the new prices that companies will announce post BS-IV. Stocks of CV manufacturers like Tata Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra could see negative impact today. Steel will India has emerged as the second largest stainless steel producer in the world after China. India overtook Japan as the second-biggest producer in 2016, according to data released by the International Stainless Steel Forum (ISSF) at their annual conference held recently between May 14-19, 2017 at Tokyo, Japan. ISSF is a non-profit research and development organisation which was founded in 1996 and which serves as the focal point for the international stainless steel industry. India’s stainless steel production rose to 3.32 million tonne in 2016 showing an impressive growth of about 9% over 3 million tonne it produced in 2015. Several government initiatives like ‘Make in India’, smart cities, focus on improving sanitation & waste management facilities, building new infrastructure etc. is likely to give a strong push to the stainless-steel industry in future. In the market, steel makers could feel the impact of a positive news. Jobs drying up With top IT firms laying off professionals, the IT-software industry was hit the most with a 24% fall in hiring in April this year as compared to April 2016, according to a survey by job site Naukri.com. "The overall job market saw an 11% fall in new jobs, with IT-software industry most hit. IT-Software industry was hit the most with a 24% decline in hiring in April as compared to April 2016," the Naukri Job Speak Index said. April jobs index saw year-on-year fall in major metros -- Delhi/NCR, Mumbai, Bengaluru and Chennai, it added. Hiring activity saw a fall in telecom, BPO, insurance and construction sectors during April as compared to April 2016.

Updated 3 hours ago The Pittsburgh Foundation is narrowing the focus of its former Day of Giving fundraiser to raise money for more than 100 nonprofits in Allegheny and Westmoreland counties that directly support people with needs in five areas. The foundation said this year's Critical Needs Alert event begins at 8 a.m. Tuesday and will last 16 hours. “The shift (from a general fundraising event) aims to support the safety net for basic needs and respond to the needs of our community,” said Kelly Uranker, the Pittsburgh Foundation's director of the Center for Philanthropy. “We want everyone to benefit from the prosperity that has occurred in the region over the last couple years,” Uranker said. In the past, the former Day of Giving event benefited a wider array of nonprofits across the region. The Pittsburgh Foundation was forced to reschedule last year's event after a glitch with its online fundraising platform caused problems about 10 hours into the daylong campaign. More than 820 nonprofits participated in the rescheduled event last September. The Critical Needs Alert event will support organizations that help people with needs related to child care, food and nutrition, physical and mental health, housing and transportation. Participating organizations include family health care centers, local YMCAs, women's centers, soup kitchens and transportation-service organizations such as the Braddock-based Heritage Community Initiatives. Uranker said the new event aligns with the foundation's “100 Percent Pittsburgh” principle, which aims to support the one-third of the region's population that falls below the poverty line and allows them to benefit from the region's improving economy. Mt. Ararat Community Activity Center, one of this year's participating nonprofits, helps provide childcare to children up to age 5. The center hopes to use money they receive from this year's fundraiser to open a larger childcare facility. “We hope that by moving to a larger facility, we will eliminate our waiting list and provide childcare to others in the community, beyond our own waiting list,” said Denise Williams, Mt. Ararat's executive director. “The funding we will gain from this Critical Needs Alert will be extremely beneficial as these are critical years for our children.” The Pittsburgh Foundation has allocated up to $657,000 to match funds raised by the participating foundations. For example, if all the groups collected a combined $600,000, the matching funds would bring the total amount raised to $1.2 million. To donate, people should visit PittsburghGives.org between 8 a.m. and midnight Tuesday. There is a minimum donation of $25. Emma Curtis is a Tribune-Review staff writer.

Costco Wholesale Corp. (ticker: COST) will step up to the earnings plate Thursday evening for its fiscal third-quarter financial report. And while Costco stock has long been a source of uncharacteristically steady growth from the retail sector, the company's quarterly earnings ritual has in recent years become a test of investor nerves.

If the sector's announcements over the past month are any indication, you can put on a blindfold and toss a quarter at a dartboard. Department-store retailers such as Macy's (M), Kohl's Corp. (KSS) and JC Penney Co. (JCP) made headlines for dreadful post-report losses, as did discounter Stein Mart (SMRT), which plunged after a dismal miss. However, Target Corp. (TGT) and Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) provided much-better-than-expected results last week, providing hope that perhaps the big-box format is where retail-sector investors can find some sanctuary. [See: 7 of the Best Stocks to Buy for 2017.] So what might give us a hint as to what third-quarter earnings hold? Perhaps the better question is: How much will Thursday really matter three, six or 12 months from now? The headline numbers. Investors could take a little encouragement from how highly Wall Street regards Costco's prospects for its fiscal third quarter. While many other retailers are suffering lousy year-over-year comparisons, analysts expect Costco to produce a 6.5 percent improvement on the top line to $28.5 billion, which should fuel a 5.6 percent gain on the bottom line to $1.31 per share. It's hard to see Costco disappointing this week – at least on the top line – given the pair of monthly sales reports it has released so far. March and April sales jumped 9 percent and 5 percent, respectively, on same-store sales improvements of 7 percent and 3 percent. Short-term pain, long-term gain. Some investors justifiably are worried about the effect of Amazon.com (AMZN) on Costco's performance this quarter, given how much the e-commerce operator appears to have cut into the sales of the rest of the sector. But Barclays' Karen Short, who upgraded COST to "overweight" in April, pooh-poohed that, pointing to a customer purchase intent survey that indicates "more than 80 percent of customers go to COST specifically for food," and that 57 percent of Costco's sales are related to groceries. In fact, there's little evidence that Amazon is an existential threat to Costco, which has posted top-line growth without pause since 2010 and whose stock has posted positive returns every year since 2009, making it a rare consistent winner in the retail space. But COST stock is hardly delivering those gains in a straight line … and a lot of the nauseating moves come after earnings. For instance, just a couple of months ago, Costco shares shed more than 6 percent in two days after profits and sales missed analysts' mark. The stock suffered similarly lousy reactions after first-quarter earnings in August and December 2015. The flip side? Even poor earnings results have kicked off rallies in COST stock, including after big misses in May and December of last year. However, while Costco might occasionally disappoint the analyst community, the long-term continues to point north. That's because the warehouse giant keeps delivering modest but consistent growth that pleads the case for patience amid its short-term fits and starts. That's reflected in firm (albeit not overexuberant) recommendations like those by Susquehanna's Bill Dreher, who reiterated his "positive" rating on COST because of "the strong monthly comp sales performance and management's commitment to rewarding shareholders." He continues, "Gross margins are expected to normalize in [the third quarter] and membership fee income will benefit for two years from the recently announced 10 percent increase effective June 1. Combined with better than expected earnings contribution from the Citi credit card partnership, we believe COST is well positioned as a core retail, defensive growth holding." The partnership he's referring to is the company's agreement with Citigroup (C) and Visa (V). Costco announced in 2015 that it would end its longtime relationship with American Express Co. (AXP), but the actual switch in April 2016 was met with some technological difficulties that had Wall Street doubting the move. More signs than not point to a third-quarter beat come Thursday evening. But investors should simply be looking for a continuation of Costco's strong performance. As long as they get that, returns will eventually follow. More Earnings in Focus Abercrombie & Fitch Co. (ANF). Abercrombie is surprisingly among the few brick-and-mortar retail stocks that are in the black so far this year, but that's largely because of reports that the battered teen retailer is shopping itself around. American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) and Express (EXPR) are supposedly interested in taking over. But Abercrombie has maintained its 20-cent quarterly dividend; Thursday's first-quarter earnings report, due before the bell, will give us insight into how ill-equipped ANF is to keep paying it. (Abercrombie's dividend has outstripped its profits for years now.) This quarter, analysts expect ANF's losses to widen 18.6 percent year-over-year to 70 cents per share, on a 5 percent revenue decline to $650.99 million. Best Buy Co. (BBY). Best Buy is beating the market soundly in 2017 with 20 percent gains, and doing so on real signs of strength, including expanded fourth-quarter margins and higher online sales. Analysts have gradually piled into the long camp, with BofA/Merrill Lynch upgrading in April on product cycle hopes and Best Buy's increased focus on services. Piper Jaffray upgraded for the same reasons, as well as hopes that store closures by HHGregg and possibly Sears Holdings Corp. (SHLD) would benefit BBY. The first quarter is expected to be soft, though, with analysts projecting a 2 percent top-line decline to $8.27 billion, trickling down to a 9 percent bottom-line drop to 40 cents per share.

Following the FDA’s confirmation that avocados are a heart-healthy superfood, in May, Avocados from Peru received the healthy Heart-Check mark from the American Heart Association. With heart disease being a leading cause of death in both women and men in the U.S., the valuable Heart-Check mark has served as a trusted resource for consumers.  By including the heart-check mark in AFP’s marketing efforts it will help to promote the nutritional benefits of avocados, and to educate consumers about healthy dietary fats.  „As the new chairman of the Peruvian Avocado Commission, I am extremely pleased with the recent developments and positive focus on the nutrition attributes of Hass avocados.  PAC has been a leading advocate for these measures and will continue paving the path during the new season within the health and beauty industry to showcase how avocados can benefit overall health and wellness for the body!” said Jose Antonio Castro, Chairman of PAC. Starting in early June, PAC will deliver Summer fresh Avocados from Peru to retailers nationwide.  Peruvian avocados have their peak season during the summer months and this year, over 150 million pounds of Peruvian avocados are projected to be imported into the United States from June to September. „With avocados being America’s favorite superfood, we expect the consumption of avocados to continue rising this summer, which is great because this is our largest crop to-date,” said Xavier Equihua, CEO and President of PAC.  „Our primary goal this season is to supply the U.S. with top-quality fruit during the peak summer season, and to educate the public about the wonderful health benefits of Peruvian Avocados.” In addition to showcasing the beneficial nutrients that occur naturally in Avocados from Peru, the commission plans to partner with other Peruvian superfoods like blueberries, quinoa and asparagus to create synergistic promotional campaigns. Kicking-off the season with a splash, Avocados from Peru (AFP) will partner with Walmart stores to participate in their annual Wellness Day on Saturday, June 17.  Over 800 stores will feature and demo a superfood rich avocado and blueberry smoothie, made with fresh Avocados from Peru, blueberries, banana, spinach leaves, almond milk and Greek yogurt.  Walmart will continue to demo delicious AFP recipes throughout the summer including a refreshing avocado peach crostini.  To help promote demo days and help drive store traffic, AFP has created a targeted Geo-Fencing mobile program that will activate within 5 miles around key stores.  Additionally, demos will also be taking place at Costco stores throughout the summer. Also launching the summer season, AFP will run a promotion with CBS Radio and feature the Avo-Dog at the Baltimore Orioles stadium during 4th of July week. Fans can enjoy avocado themed food while cheering on their favorite team this summer. AFP’s 2017 robust marketing program introduces an experiential three-month long campaign that includes high-profile partnerships; increased trade and consumer advertising; an expanded menu of retailer support and incentive programs; and more opportunities to engage directly with consumers through social media initiatives. TRADE SUPPORT With increased marketing support and a large volume of fresh avocados imported from Peru, PAC is, once again, offering produce managers a greater variety of tools to merchandise the popular summer fruit. CONSUMER TACTICS This year AFP is launching a strong consumer outreach program, highlights include: All 2017 AFP marketing promotions will be supported by a strategic and engaging social media campaign.

This series chronicles the fall-out of those laws, and the litigation that has followed. Welcome to Gavel Drop, our roundup of legal news, headlines, and head-shaking moments in the courts. A Mississippi man was sentenced to more than 40 years in prison for the first-ever federal hate crime charge related to an offense against a transgender person for the 2015 killing of 17-year-old Mercedes Williamson. An Ohio librarian settled a lawsuit against her employer after the library’s health insurance plan refused to pay for her gender confirmation surgery. As part of the agreement, the library system has since changed its insurance policy to cover the procedure. Retail giant Walmart settled a class-action discrimination lawsuit for $7.5 million after refusing spousal benefits to same-sex couples. The Arkansas-based chain began offering same-sex partners benefits such as health insurance only in 2014, after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the federal Defense of Marriage Act.

Meanwhile, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito told Catholic seminary students that their religious liberties were under attack. An Australian creationist who also has a doctorate in geology has sued the National Park Service, arguing that its refusal to let him root around in Grand Canyon for evidence that the Earth is much younger than scientists have proven violates his First Amendment religious rights. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) filed a lawsuit on behalf of Frontier Airlines flight attendants who allege the airline refuses to accommodate pregnant or breastfeeding attendants. Baylor University faces another Title IX lawsuit related to its football team, and the allegations of parties including gang rape and dog fighting are brutal. Wisconsin’s so-called “cocaine mom” law could be done for good. A group of Black voters in Alabama have sued over the way appellate judges are elected in the state, arguing the practice of electing them by statewide vote violates the Voting Rights Act. The Trump administration is trying to go after the lawyers who stepped up and went to airports to help those stranded and detained following the first Muslim travel and entry ban. The Ohio Supreme Court is deliberating whether anyone younger than 13—the age of consent in the state—can be charged with sex crimes. The case in question involves a 9-year-old and a 12-year-old. A group of former inmates is asking the U.S. Supreme Court to review a Minnesota law that allows the state to place convicted sex offenders indefinitely in treatment facilities after they have completed their criminal sentences. The ACLU of Indiana is suing to block a new law that would allow a judge to tell a minor’s parents their child asked for judicial consent to get an abortion whether the request is granted or not. A judge dismissed the case of a Tennessee woman who sued after she claims she was illegally denied an abortion while in jail, ruling she waited too long to bring her lawsuit. Attorneys for the state of Missouri have appealed a lower court ruling blocking a Texas-like requirement that abortion providers in the state have admitting privileges and that area clinics meet unnecessary ambulatory surgical center requirements.

Tillerson is the former CEO of ExxonMobil. By Julia Horowitz NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- With the Trump budget about to drop, business leaders have a message for Secretary of State Rex Tillerson: State Department funding equals jobs. A letter sent to Tillerson on Monday that signed by 225 executives argues that a robust budget for the State Department and U.S. development agencies helps American companies who do business abroad and supports jobs back home. Companies that signed on to the letter include Walmart, Pfizer, Coca-Cola, DuPont, Mars, Procter & Gamble and Nike. "With 95 percent of the world's consumers outside the United States and many of the fastest growing economies in the developing world, now is the time to double down on America's global economic leadership," the letter reads. The Trump administration will reveal its full budget for fiscal 2018 on Tuesday. In a "skinny" budget unveiled in March, the State Department saw its funds slashed 28.7%. The letter puts America's diplomatic interests in starkly corporate terms. It's a clear effort to appeal to a secretary of state who was a career oil executive, as well as to an "America First" president who has made domestic job creation his cornerstone issue. It makes the case that foreign engagement is as much about opening up new markets as it is about promoting democratic institutions. "Our embassies and consulates around the world are essential partners for American businesses to ensure we can compete on a level playing field," the letter says. Foreign aid, meanwhile, will help the U.S. tamp down its trade deficit. "Eleven of America's top fifteen export markets are in countries that have been recipients of U.S. foreign assistance," it reads. The overture also notes that "economic freedom, prosperity, and entrepreneurship" can mitigate the spread of "violent extremism." The Trump administration's proposed State Department cuts were met with bipartisan backlash shortly after they were announced. A corps of retired military generals has been making the rounds on Capitol Hill, asking lawmakers to preserve funding for diplomacy. The initial proposal reduces funding for the World Bank, the United Nations and climate change programs. It also calls for "reorganization and consolidation" within the department. Several State Department officials have also told CNN that Tillerson is considering trimming between 2,300 and 2,500 employees. TM & © 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on: Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink: Purchase: Order Reprint WASHINGTON – Target CEO Brian Cornell will argue Tuesday before a House committee against a tax change that would significantly increase the cost of imports for the Minneapolis-based retailer. Target, one of the top sellers of imported goods in the United States, has been fighting the proposal since Republicans floated it late last year as a way of encouraging American businesses to bring foreign jobs home and create new ones in the United States. If the tax is enacted, U.S. companies would in effect pay taxes on the full cost of imported items and not just on profits from sales of those items. The proposal, known as a border adjustment tax, aims to offset tax cuts elsewhere in a tax reform plan under consideration in the House. Target, along with Richfield-based Best Buy and other retailers that sell a lot of foreign-made goods, has been aggressively lobbying against the change. Cornell has met with 30 lawmakers since December, and Target government affairs staffers have held more than 200 meetings with lawmakers on the issue, spokeswoman Dustee Jenkins said. While the company supports tax reform, Jenkins said, "We are incredibly concerned about the impact of this particular legislation." Cornell will appear Tuesday at a House Ways and Means Committee hearing titled "Increasing U.S. Competitiveness and Preventing American Jobs from Moving Overseas." Other speakers include the chief executive of Archer Daniels Midland, a big exporter that backs the plan, and former Wal-Mart CEO Bill Simon. While Simon has expressed support for the border tax, Wal-Mart is part of a retail coalition that has been working against it. Supporters of the proposal have argued that the value of the U.S. dollar would adjust to offset any tax effect on consumers. But retailers question that and say the likely effects of the proposal would be either higher prices for shoppers or lower profits. Rep. Erik Paulsen of Minnesota, a Ways and Means Committee member, voiced some support for the measure earlier this year, though his office didn't respond to messages in recent days seeking an update on his position. He told the Star Tribune in February that he had been meeting with dozens of businesses on Capitol Hill and offered to put them in touch with Ways and Means Committee Chairman Rep. Kevin Brady (R-Texas), his roommate in Washington. Minnesota's other House Republicans, Reps. Tom Emmer and Jason Lewis, haven't stated their positions on the tax this year. Last week, in a conference call organized by border adjustment opponents, Madesmart Housewares, a St. Paul company that imports and sells Chinese-made products to help organize kitchens, offices and bathrooms, said it would have to increase its prices by one-third if the tax went into effect. On Monday, Target said prices could rise up to 20 percent on some of its inventory. Otherwise, the company suggested in a recent securities filing, it could take a major hit to its bottom line. "A large portion of our merchandise is sourced, directly or indirectly, from outside the United States, with China as our single largest source," the company said in the filing. "[M]ajor changes in tax policy or trade relations, such as the disallowance of tax deductions for imported merchandise or the imposition of additional tariffs or duties on imported products, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, effective income tax rate, liquidity and net income." Cornell was also among a number of retail executives who met with President Donald Trump in February to share their concerns about the proposed tax. Best Buy CEO Hubert Joly, who also opposes it and has traveled to Washington to talk to lawmakers about it, participated in the White House meeting, too. Major retailers met recently with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to voice opposition to the plan. The Minnesota Retailers Association (MnRA), like its national counterpart, is fighting the measure. "Tax reform is a great idea," said MnRA President Bruce Nustad. "But the border adjustment tax is not the right approach for Minnesota retailers." Last week, Cornell told reporters that he's been "very engaged" in Washington to make clear Target's point of view that the tax would lead to higher prices on basic household essentials and on things like children's clothing. "We've made a strong case that this is not the right thing for America," he said. When asked how worried he was about the tax becoming a reality, he said he felt the retail industry had been effective in getting its message across to lawmakers. "I feel like we're in a much better place today then we were on Jan. 2," he said. kavita.kumar@startribune.com kavitakumar maya.rao@startribune.com 651-925-5043 mrao_strib jim.spencer@startribune.com 612-270-1266 SpencerStrib View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive, mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

(Photo Credit: Staff Sgt. Shejal Pulivarti ) VIEW ORIGINAL When about 12,000 cadets from colleges across the nation descend on Fort Knox this summer for Cadet Summer Training, eight dining facilities will open to accommodate them as well as the more than 5,000 cadre. When CST is not on Fort Knox, only one DFAC is typically open--Cantigny. Fort Knox Food Program Manager Brad Richardson said when the other DFACs open those will be for cadets. The facilities will be in Bldgs. 5940, 6012, 5915, 6018, 5917, 6542, 6555 and 2835. Before CST begins the staff begin preparing the DFACs for the cadets. For example, if a piece of equipment isn't operational and can't be fixed, Richardson is responsible for ordering a new one. If the equipment is over a certain price it must go through contracting and out for bidding, which takes time. During the process of making sure everything is in the DFACs, Richardson discovered there had been issues with some of the HVAC systems and they needed to be repaired. The kitchen equipment must remain covered while this work is being completed--making it difficult to determine if replacements are required. Additionally, the facilities have to be cleaned and undergo a variety of inspections. Recycling and dumpsters also have to be installed in the facilities. Making sure all of this is done presents a challenge for Richardson. "A lot of stuff has to be done," Richardson said. "It's a longer process than just going to Lowe's or Wal-Mart." While making sure the DFACs were operational Richardson ran into an issue at Kouma. A few years ago Kouma closed and stopped functioning as a DFAC and became a child development center, which meant parts of the structure had to be changed to meet the needs of a CDC. Doing so meant it no longer had a main line for food or a salad bar and those had to be rebuilt in the facility. The facility was named after the late Master Sgt. Ernest Kouma, a former Fort Knox game warden who was a recipient of the Medal of Honor for his actions during the Korean War. Although Kouma won't open by the time CST begins, Richardson said it might be operational by mid-July. Another challenge that Richardson has while preparing for CST is hiring an experienced workforce during the summer because there aren't many places in the surrounding areas that has the capabilities of feeding about 16,000 people. "Nothing outside the gates can compare to this," explained Richardson. "(We) hire college students (and they typically aren't) experienced cooks or dining facility attendants. (We) have to train them and get them up to speed at a quick pace. (We) can't hire (them any earlier because of) the contract." Richardson said the first DFAC will open May 25 and the others will stagger their openings ev- ery seven to 10 days. But, he said, cadre are on Fort Knox and they have been using Bldg. 6542 as their dining facility. As the date gets closer for cadets to arrive on post, Richardson will ensure the newly hired staff have what they need. "IT equipment has to be up to speed (and) new employees have to go through (the Fort Knox Network Enterprise Center," he said. "(We) have to (also) get (common access cards) for the new employees." Once the summer is over it will be time to begin the process of shutting down the DFACs. Crews will begin cleaning and inspect the equipment. They will also begin the process of of switching out appliances that need to be changed. Editor's note: Catrina Francis, Gold Standard acting editor, contributed to this article.

But that is what Rhonda Hoffman says happened to her on Aug. 16, 2015, after she ate some of the jerky. She took a video of the worms and the following day returned the package to the Wal-Mart store near Selinsgrove where she had purchased it. As the result of ingesting some of the contaminated product, Hoffman claims she has developed psychological issues, has problems sleeping and has issues eating certain foods. She proceeded with her marriage on Aug. 29, 2015, but because she had lost weight due to eating issues her wedding gown had to be altered, she says. Hoffman and her husband Karl, who live in Winfield, canceled their honeymoon trip to Montana because of her emotional and mental trauma, a complaint originally filed in Union County court states. She has undergone psychological treatment and those expenses will continue, according to the suit that Friday was transferred to U.S. Middle District Court. Claims against Links Snacks Inc., the manufacturer headquartered in Wisconsin, and Wal-Mart include breach of warranty, product liability, negligence and loss of consortium. The Hoffmans point out the package was properly sealed and not out of date, so the worms had to be present when it left Links Snacks. They were seeking damages in excess of $50,000 in county court, but the federal court threshold is $75,000. Jack Link's issued the following statement Monday evening: "There is no higher priority for Jack Link's than providing the highest quality meat snacks to our valued customers. "Our family-owned company has an impeccable reputation and record when it comes to food safety because we take it extraordinarily seriously. "In addition, our facilities are highly regulated and thoroughly inspected by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and we welcome their oversight. "It goes without saying that we cannot comment on active litigation matters, but we are proud of our products and look forward to our day in court."

Strategies must change. Sarkar is available to discuss how companies can use supply chain and sourcing to compete in these disruptive times. Says Sarkar: „When CEOs think about the supply chain, it’s usually to cut costs. But the smartest leaders see supply chain and sourcing for what they can be: hidden tools for outperforming the competition. Across a range of industries, once-leading companies are in trouble: Walmart, IBM, Pfizer, HP, and The Gap to name a few. But others thrive. While competitors were shutting stores, Zara’s highly responsive supply chain made it the most valued company in the retail space and its founder, the richest man in Europe. The success of TJX, Amazon, Starbucks and Airbus is fueled by supply chain and sourcing.” Sarkar is the author of The Supply Chain Revolution: Innovative Sourcing and Logistics for a Fiercely Competitive World (AMACOM), and is available for interviews in English and Hindi. Website: www.three-s-consulting.com The Effectiveness of Worksite Programs in Reducing Opioid Abuse Dr. Joel Bennett CEO and Founder Organizational Wellness & Learning Systems, Inc. (OWLS) While the opioid and prescription drug epidemic has received considerable attention given the over 300,000 people it affects annually, relatively few realize the impact it’s also having on the nation’s workforce. It’s become increasingly commonplace for employees to use prescription medication outside of intended use to improve job performance, overcome lack of sleep, or to alleviate pain. Although 70% of employers are negatively impacted by Rx abuse, less than 25% educate workers on prevention. Thirty percent do not provide access to alternative treatments. Says Dr. Bennett: „Employers are starting to realize the negative effects of Rx abuse on employee readiness, morale and productivity. But prevention programs can be a hard sell — it’s a challenge to demonstrate a concrete business return. Employers need to know that worksite awareness and education programs can be very effective in engaging people at the earliest stages of their Rx use and in a non-threatening way, steer them to safe alternatives. SAMHSA (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration) has laid out criteria and guidelines for evidence-based programs that produce positive outcomes; if properly implemented at the worksite, these programs have the potential to effectively educate a sizeable portion of at-risk employees who are otherwise hard to identify, let alone reach.” Dr. Bennett is a widely sought-after speaker, consultant, and source on issues pertaining to evidence-based wellness. He has also published in a broad variety of academic, industry and business publications and consults internationally. Website: http://organizationalwellness.com Contact: Charles Epstein, che@backboneinc.com Why All Workplaces Need an Onsite Coach/Psychologist Michael Klein, PsyD Psychologist, Principal MK Insights LLC „The key to staying on track at work is managing internal roadblocks and reacting thoughtfully to external ones. While a few industries understand the benefit to the bottom line in having highly trained, in-house coaches and advisors available, most haven’t caught on yet. This is not about providing therapy at work but, rather, applying sound psychological insights and tools to help successful (and often narcissistic or sociopathic) leaders perform at peak capacity based on their own need to do well and manage critical blindspots.” Dr. Klein is available to speak about the use of in-house psychiatrists and psychologists as consultants when a deeper understanding of mental health and personality is required. As a psychologist, he can address how personality, emotional intelligence, and motivators impact decision-making, management style, and potential „de-railing” behaviors. He is the author of „Trapped in the Family Business: A practical guide to understanding and managing this hidden dilemma,” and is approaching 20 years of experience as a human resources professional, psychologist, and organizational consultant.

We can train neural networks with much more data than humans experience during a lifetime. This means that we can reproduce the competence of the best experts, or even outperform them! We can guarantee reproducibility in exams and diagnosis, and avoid human subjectivity and variations. With active learning models, results can continuously be improved. With better ground truth, i.e. data from different sources, time or outcome, AI can make better predictions, solve more complex tasks and make new discoveries.” Based in Stockholm, Sweden, Hedlund is the chief technology officer and one of the founders of ContextVision. He finished his M.Sc. degree of Technology followed by further studies and research in image processing and GOP theory at Linköping University. He was R&D and site manager in Linköping until 1999 and has since served as CTO by focusing on strategic product and business development. Hedlund is spearheading the research and development of ContextVision’s first AI-based imaging technology. By using algorithms, the product will be able to evaluate and enhance image quality automatically without the direct involvement of a clinical expert. This will improve workflow and improve diagnosis, and ultimately aid both patients and radiologists.

Affan, in News | Technology News     Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2 will come Aboard the Nintendo Platform this Fall Season Apparently, the game bearing the title Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2 will come to Nintendo soon. Yet there is more good news and that consists of the fact that it will be coming westward at the same time as well. Don't Miss: Find Rare Products in Stock Online with The Tracker According to Forbes, everybody seemed to make the assumption that it would come west and so the company picked up on these vibes among the clientele. The game exists on PS4, Xbox One and PC already. The Nintendo Switch version will be interesting to observe. Besides the control panel, the multiplayer mode will make this game the best thing that happened to gamers since the days of Space Invaders. Bandai Namco took to Twitter to announce the release of this game sometime this fall. There will be ad hoc play, motion controls and two player wars on this system which is indeed a good thing. The developers are doing the best they can to make this game an interesting one. Dragon Ball #Xenoverse2 arrives on #Switch in Fall 2017! Features: Ad-hoc play, motion controls, 2P battle on 1 system w/ 1 joy con each. pic.twitter.com/WzxlKVAsbK— Bandai Namco US (@BandaiNamcoUS) May 20, 2017 According to Twinfinite, the players playing this game can create their own avatars and explore a virtual world. They can also learn novel skills and give a thrashing to their opponents if necessary. It is a cool game that will build better hand-eye coordination to boot.  Find out which Nintendo Switch game are released this week. GameStop offers two new Nintendo Switch bundles that are much lower priced than the bundles offered in the past weeks. An online Nintendo Switch sale that we know is coming up this week is hosted by Walmart. Walmart is expected to sell the Nintendo Switch again online at 5pm ET on Friday. Shoppers can get notified when the sale begins with The Tracker app.  The Nintendo Switch reseller markups keep steady and range today between $91 to $100 for the Nintendo Switch with Gray Joy-Con and $99 to $130 for the Nintendo Switch with Neon Joy-Con on amazon.com. Getting a bundle from an official store makes sense as long as customers wanted to by the bundle games anyway. Our new online inventory tracker app The Tracker will send a notification when the Nintendo Switch is spotted in stock at major online retailers including Amazon.com. Nintendo is ramping up the production for the Nintendo Switch, but has not disclosed what the current production capacity per month is. The only number the company made official is the production volume over the next 12 months. 10 million Switch consoles are planned to enter retail channels until end of April 2018. The demand for the Nintendo Switch will spike during the Holiday Shopping season 2017. Nintendo will set aside a large part of the Switch production during the next months for November and December. This stock piling will keep the Nintendo Switch in short supply during the next 5 months. As Nintendo coordinated new Switch console shipment with the launch of Mario Kart 8, we expect the company to do the same for the next major Switch game launches. The big upcoming Switch games are Arms on June 16 and Splatoon 2 on July 21. Amazon offers pre-order discounts on both of the titles for Prime members to the tune of 20%. There are also several new accessories coming on the market from Nintendo in the next weeks. See the full list of new Nintendo Switch accessories. This story may contain affiliate links.

The demand for the Nintendo Switch will spike during the Holiday Shopping season 2017. Nintendo will set aside a large part of the Switch production during the next months for November and December. This stock piling will keep the Nintendo Switch in short supply during the next 5 months. As Nintendo coordinated new Switch console shipment with the launch of Mario Kart 8, we expect the company to do the same for the next major Switch game launches. The big upcoming Switch games are Arms on June 16 and Splatoon 2 on July 21. Amazon offers pre-order discounts on both of the titles for Prime members to the tune of 20%. There are also several new accessories coming on the market from Nintendo in the next weeks. See the full list of new Nintendo Switch accessories. This story may contain affiliate links.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 22 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman The Time to Repeal the Durbin Amendment is Now: New Survey Underscores Policy’s Failures WASHINGTON–(BUSINESS WIRE)–New Morning Consult survey data released today confirms the need to end the Durbin amendment, with seven in ten voters unaware of having received a discount at the register since the policy went into effect. Across party lines, voters agree that if merchants aren’t passing along savings from the law, it should be repealed. To date, big box stores have pocketed $42 billion at their customers’ expense. The new polling data found nearly 70 percent of voters say these big box retailers like Target and Walmart are looking out for their own bottom lines, not main street interests. “Time and time again, evidence shows the Durbin amendment has been a complete failure and the latest Morning Consult polling is no exception,” said Molly Wilkinson, executive director of the Electronic Payments Coalition (EPC). “For six years, big box retailers have broken their promises to lower costs, and consumers, small businesses, community banks, and credit unions are paying the price. Voters recognize the Durbin amendment for what it is: a price control that serves only to pad retailers’ bottom lines. It is time for Congress to act now to end this special interest policy.” Despite proponents of the Durbin amendment—including big box retailers and special interests groups—saying it would help consumers and small businesses, only the largest retailers have seen any benefits from the policy. These large merchants have pocketed approximately $6-8 billion a year and, as evidenced in the survey, have failed to lower prices. This is in line with a Richmond Federal Reserve study that found only one percent of retailers have lowered their prices as promised since the Durbin amendment’s price controls went into effect. Additionally, by a 4-1 margin, voters say RILA and the other associations pushing to keep this government price control don’t protect main street interests. EPC urges the immediate repeal of the Durbin amendment and asks Congress to support Section 735 of the Financial CHOICE Act. To view EPC’s infographic on the polling click here. Morning Consult, on behalf of the Electronic Payments Coalition, conducted an online survey of 1,970 registered voters from May 16-18, 2017. Results from the full survey have a margin of error of +/- 2%. About the Electronic Payments Coalition The Electronic Payments Coalition (EPC) is a coalition of payments industry stakeholders, such as credit unions, community banks, trade associations, payment card networks and banks that speaks on behalf of the payments industry to protect the value, innovation, convenience, security and competition that exists in the modern electronic payments system.

By Alexander C. Kaufman 250 Royal Dutch Shell has issued its starkest warning yet to the Trump administration to not pull out of the Paris Agreement addressing climate change. The Anglo-Dutch oil behemoth said withdrawing from the historic 2015 deal to cut greenhouse gas emissions “would be unhelpful on a number of fronts,” sacrificing diplomatic leverage in international trade deals and impeding U.S. companies. “What I think would happen as a consequence of [withdrawal] is that the U.S. would weaken its own hand by basically uninviting itself from a number of [negotiating] tables,” Shell CEO Ben van Beurden told the Financial Times in an interview published Monday morning. President Donald Trump vowed on the campaign trail to “cancel” the pact, signed by all but two countries. The White House is split on whether to move ahead with that promise, but sources told HuffPost earlier this month he is leaning toward withdrawal. He could announce a decision by next month, after the conclusion of a G7 summit of the world’s most industrialized democracies. U.S. departure from the Paris Agreement would weaken the accord, despite pledges by other countries, including China, to forge ahead, van Beurden said. “The U.S. has a major crop of companies that deliver technologies that are going to be relevant in the energy transition, and one way or another they will also find themselves probably more disadvantaged than advantaged by the U.S. pulling out” of the agreement, he said. “So I cannot see where the upside is.”   Shell did not respond to a request from HuffPost for comment. Sergio Moraes / Reuters Ben van Beurden, chief executive officer of Royal Dutch Shell, is a vocal proponent of the Paris Agreement.  Most Americans support the agreement, with 61 saying the U.S. should stay in the deal, while just 17 percent supported backing out, according to a HuffPost/YouGov poll taken last week. Even deposed Fox News pundit Bill O’Reilly urged Trump to keep the U.S. in the pact last November. Most major oil, gas and coal companies, including U.S. giant Exxon Mobil Corp., back the deal. So do a bevy of other corporate titans, such as Walmart, General Mills and DuPont. But Shell may be the pact’s most vocal proponent in the fossil fuel industry. And with good reason ― the company has money on the line. “With the U.S. being the largest investment destination for a company like Shell, yes, I think I would regret having a lot of business here that potentially could be at a disadvantage because of [the] implications of that decision to pull out’’ of the accord, van Beurden said. It takes years, sometimes decades, for oil and gas firms to yield profits on drilling exploration, and the White House has little effect on current investment decisions that van Beurden said would “probably only become economically relevant after the current president’s term.” But he said the company would consider drilling in the Atlantic Ocean, an area Trump reopened to offshore exploration with an executive order last month. Last December, President Barack Obama blocked offshore drilling in the Atlantic and the Arctic oceans with an executive order the Trump administration has since reversed. In 2015, Shell failed to find a big enough oil reserve in the waters off Alaska, and van Beurden said the company would not return to the region. “Arctic offshore? No. We’re done with that,” he said. “We had our episode there. We know what it takes, how difficult it can get.” Shell’s loud opposition to a U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Agreement comes amid a growing fight at the United Nations over fossil fuel companies’ role in climate negotiations. Environmental groups and negotiators from developing countries most at risk from climate change proposed new rules on lobbying and conflicts of interest that could limit the corporate presence at the talks. Big companies cannot participate directly in the negotiations, but nearly 300 industry groups attended the talks this month in Bonn, Germany, potentially influencing the scope of regulations and agreements developed there. “With the U.S. being the largest investment destination for a company like Shell, yes, I think I would regret having a lot of business here that potentially could be at a disadvantage ... Proponents of the new guidelines cite the exclusion of cigarette companies from the global tobacco treaty that came to fruition in 2003. Fossil fuel firms play a much more critical role in the global economy than tobacco companies, so the situations are not perfectly analogous. Tobacco firms spent years undermining studies that linked smoking to lung cancer and other diseases, and negotiators disqualified the companies from joining treaty talks based on admissions that they covered up evidence. Shell publicly denied fossil fuels’ role in global warming for years, but a corporate film, published by a Dutch news site last February, showed that the company understood the link between burning oil and climate change as far back as 1991. Still, Shell has more of a stake in a low-carbon future than cigarette companies do in ending the smoking epidemic. “Successful outcomes of climate policymaking will have a big impact on the fossil fuel industry,” Lawrence-Samuel, international policy director at the watchdog group Corporate Accountability International, told HuffPost. “We have to be realistic and recognize that economies are largely dependent on the fossil fuel industry still.” Related...

Plus: Get the Mass Effect trilogy for just $5! Laptops by Rick Broida May 22, 2017 5:32 AM PDT @cheapskateblog CNET's Cheapskate scours the web for great deals on PCs, phones, gadgets and much more. Questions about the Cheapskate blog? Find the answers on our FAQ page. And find more great buys on the CNET Deals page. Lenovo Good heavens, we are all spoiled rotten. Information at our fingertips, computing powerhouses in our pockets, laptops for $129. Think about this last for a second. A mere 25 years ago, an IBM ThinkPad would have cost you $2,375 (or around $4,000 in inflation-adjusted dollars). And it would have been a heavy, bulky slowpoke with a small, grayscale screen. Just 20 years ago, a color laptop -- the Gateway Solo, for example -- cost over $6,000 (inflation-adjusted). Ten years ago, a Dell XPS cost around $3,300. Not that you couldn't buy a laptop for less, but it's easy to forget how expensive they used to be. Today, this: Walmart has the Lenovo N22 11.6-inch Chromebook for $129 shipped (plus tax). Come on! This is the machine you buy for a kid who needs a laptop, the one who's heading off to middle school in the fall or needs something a little better than the aging hand-me-down you bought four years ago. It's no powerhouse, but it's powerful enough, with an Intel Celeron processor, 4GB of RAM (one would expect 2GB at this price point) and 16GB of expandable storage. Whoa, that's not much, right? Keep in mind this is a Chromebook, so it's designed to store schoolwork and other documents in Google's cloud. That said, you can easily (and inexpensively) devote one of the N22's two USB 3.0 ports to a full-time flash drive -- like this SanDisk 32GB Ultra Fit drive for $14.39. (Don't get me started on how cheap that is.) Lenovo packs in a few other amenities as well, including a webcam that can rotate up and down, a water-resistant keyboard and a battery that's good for up to 10 hours of runtime. The N22 also offers Bluetooth 4.0 and all the Wi-Fis: 802.11a/b/g/n/ac. It weighs 2.8 pounds. The Mass Effect trilogy is on sale for just $5! BioWare Not too shabby for $129, am I right? The one caveat I have is printing: Your student will almost certainly need to do some, so you'll need to make sure you have a Google Cloud Print-compatible printer. (See "How to print from a Chromebook" to learn more.) Your thoughts? Bonus deal: Game time! If you never played the Mass Effect series, you missed on some truly epic action-RPG sci-fi goodness. You also saved yourself a boatload of money, because for a limited time, Cdkeys has the Mass Effect Trilogy (PC) for $5.19. Over at Steam, just the first two games alone would run you $40. (Mass Effect 3 isn't even available there.) This deal nets you redemption keys for Origin, though, not Steam -- meaning you'll need an Origin account and the client software. The three games debuted in 2007, 2010 and 2012, and all earned top marks from GameSpot (among other sites). Check out this review of Mass Effect 3, just to get the flavor.

Across party lines, voters agree that if merchants aren’t passing along savings from the law, it should be repealed. To date, big box stores have pocketed $42 billion at their customers’ expense. The new polling data found nearly 70 percent of voters say these big box retailers like Target and Walmart are looking out for their own bottom lines, not main street interests. “Time and time again, evidence shows the Durbin amendment has been a complete failure and the latest Morning Consult polling is no exception,” said Molly Wilkinson, executive director of the Electronic Payments Coalition (EPC). “For six years, big box retailers have broken their promises to lower costs, and consumers, small businesses, community banks, and credit unions are paying the price. Voters recognize the Durbin amendment for what it is: a price control that serves only to pad retailers’ bottom lines. It is time for Congress to act now to end this special interest policy.” Despite proponents of the Durbin amendment—including big box retailers and special interests groups—saying it would help consumers and small businesses, only the largest retailers have seen any benefits from the policy. These large merchants have pocketed approximately $6-8 billion a year and, as evidenced in the survey, have failed to lower prices. This is in line with a Richmond Federal Reserve study that found only one percent of retailers have lowered their prices as promised since the Durbin amendment’s price controls went into effect. Additionally, by a 4-1 margin, voters say RILA and the other associations pushing to keep this government price control don’t protect main street interests. EPC urges the immediate repeal of the Durbin amendment and asks Congress to support Section 735 of the Financial CHOICE Act. To view EPC’s infographic on the polling click here. Morning Consult, on behalf of the Electronic Payments Coalition, conducted an online survey of 1,970 registered voters from May 16-18, 2017. Results from the full survey have a margin of error of +/- 2%. About the Electronic Payments Coalition The Electronic Payments Coalition (EPC) is a coalition of payments industry stakeholders, such as credit unions, community banks, trade associations, payment card networks and banks that speaks on behalf of the payments industry to protect the value, innovation, convenience, security and competition that exists in the modern electronic payments system. The EPC educates policymakers, consumers and the media on the system’s role in economic growth and the importance of consumer choice, security, innovation and stability for the continued growth of global commerce.

And you absolutely need amazing new flowers in new pots with new spring colors, along with a new layer of mulch, new decorative rock, and a wind chime for good measure. While all of these purchases can absolutely improve your home’s look this spring, these kinds of home upgrades can become costly – especially if you do them year after year. One season’s worth of mulch alone can cost $100 or more (depending on the size of your beds), and new shrubs, flowers, decorative items, and plants can set you back even more. And once you start upgrading, it can be difficult to stop. So, how can you save money while keeping your home in tip-top shape? Here are some tips to spruce up your yard without spending a fortune. #1: Tackle one project at a time, and ignore the rest. At my house, we tend to take an either/or approach to home maintenance each spring; in other words, we tackle one project each year, and leave the rest alone. This year, we bought a new garden shed… and that pretty much wiped out our yard maintenance budget for the year. To make up for it, we’re skipping the mulch altogether (we’ll survive), reusing all our pots from last year (except for one that busted), and trying not to buy anything else. #2: Ask friends or neighbors to split their plants. While not all plants can be divided and shared, some absolutely can – perennial plants are naturally inclined to spread. And if you’re trying to save money on lawn upkeep, it’s hard to beat free plants. Kim Anderson of Thrifty Little Mom says her money-saving strategy for this year includes taking advantage of as many freebies as she can. “My mother-in-law divided hostas she had in her yard and we transplanted them in our yard to make it look nice at no cost,” says Anderson. “Now, each year we can divide and transplant the ones we have to create more plants without spending money.” #3: Lay long-lasting rock when you can. Rock is easy to maintain and almost never needs to be replaced. Aside from pulling weeds that sprout up between your rock landscaping, you’ll have little work to do all year long. Amy Blacklock of Life Zemplified says she set herself up for savings a few years ago when she gave up on struggling shrubs and chose to “plant” rocks instead. “We finally tackled the overgrown shrubs on the side of our home we purchased two years ago. Because the area doesn’t get much sun, we decided to make a rock garden instead,” Blacklock says. “We purchased some pebble stones on sale and gathered numerous large stones and rocks from our field and our surrounding neighbors’ yards and fields. We then added a few potted plants that grow well in shaded areas.” Keep in mind, you can buy 0.5 cubic feet of river pebbles for as little as $3.50 at Walmart. And you may never need to replace it again. #4: Quit trying to keep things alive that shouldn’t be. If you’re tired of paying for water or to replace plants that always seem to struggle, you can save money and hassle by giving up. If you live in a desert, for example, growing grass is an uphill battle that you will surely lose – but only after you spend a boatload of cash. Aaron Crowe of Cash Smarter figured this out the hard way during California’s long drought that only recently came to an end. “After letting the grass die for years, because wasting water on a lawn in the backyard seemed stupid, we had the backyard covered with wood chips instead,” she says. “We’ve added lawn furniture and a hammock, creating a great outdoors area with minimal weed picking and upkeep required.” #5: Hire a landscape designer to create a plan, but do the work yourself. Perhaps you want to completely overhaul your yard, but you barely know where to start. If you’re willing to do most of the actual work but need some guidance on layout, materials, and plant selection, Cheryl Reed from service review site Angie’s List suggests hiring a professional for design work only. After an on-site consultation, they’ll come up with a master plan for your yard – and you can either have them do the work, or chip away at it yourself. “If your plan is truly transformational, consider investing in hiring a landscaping pro to give you a plan that you implement yourself,” says Reed. “There’s a cost here, but a pro will have a better idea than you about what will work best, and it’s the perfect way to establish that phased-in approach to creating your best yard.” #6: Explore the magic of paint. Whether we’re talking about upgrading your home’s interior or exterior, it’s amazing what a can of paint can do. Paint makes surfaces appear cleaner and better maintained, and a cute color can brighten up any home or garden. “Paint usually helps a lot!” says Mary Shockley, a Realtor in Florida. “Can you paint your sidewalk, front door, garage door?” With around $20 in paint and a paintbrush, you can liven up your home’s curb appeal. Shockley suggests talking to a specialist to see what paint would be best for the surface being painted. And while you could go with a solid color you’re already comfortable with, new paints (including textured options) on the market can create some pretty cool effects for outdoor surfaces. #7: Experiment with solar lighting. If you want to spruce up your yard without any ongoing expense, solar lighting can highlight the beauty of your home – and add some utility and safety to walkways as well. “An easy way to improve the look of your front and backyard is by installing strategically placed solar powered lights,” says Evan Harris of CD Equity Partners. “Whether you’re looking to illuminate your yard for security reasons or simply to highlight certain features, investing in solar powered lights is an easy and cheap way to upgrade your home’s exterior. Better yet, they require very little maintenance after installation.” You can get a 10-pack of outdoor solar lights for around $22 at Lowes.com. #8: Give everything a good cleaning. If you don’t want to make any extreme upgrades, giving your home’s exterior a good cleaning can help brighten things up. Use Brillo Steel Wool Soap Pads to scrub outdoor garbage cans, clean up your grill, and remove grime from outdoor children’s toys and outdoor tables and chairs. Sweeping your driveway, sidewalks, and garden pathways will also help, as will picking up trash and debris. Borrow a power washer to spray down your deck and your exterior siding. Lastly, wipe down your windows to make your home appear shiny and clean. Related: A Frugal Spring Cleaning Checklist #9: Dress up your patio. If you plan to spend a ton of time outdoors this year, upgrading your patio might be worth it. You don’t have to spend a lot of money, however. Most of the time, you can spruce up the place with some pretty pots and plants. “Every porch or patio needs greenery,” says Lisa Melone Cloughen of Melone Cloughen Interiors. “Think containers, mixing a variety of urn and planter styles. Mix larger scale classically inspired urns with mid-century drip glaze pots and sleek glazed or zinc contemporary urns,” she says. Melone Cloughen suggests filling the larger urns and some smaller ones, too, with a variety of plants based on color, texture, and dimension. Consider mixing taller plants with ivy and moss spilling over the sides. “Bold color combinations such as orange and purple look really great too, and for smaller, tabletop arrangements consider a mix of succulents, all of which add to the visual interest of the space.” The Bottom Line If you want to improve your home’s look without overspending this year, the best thing you can do is ignore most of what your home improvement store says. Take a close look at your home, yard, and garden and determine what you really need to enjoy your outdoor space before you head to the store. If you go with a list of upgrades and a budget in mind, it’s a lot easier to avoid getting sucked into spending more than you planned. Also remember it’s impossible to keep up with the Joneses. We all have those neighbors who spend thousands making sure their yard is in tip top shape. While there’s nothing wrong with taking pride in your home, you shouldn’t have to spend a bundle to create a clean and sophisticated look. By strategically investing your money into a few upgrades every spring, you can ensure your home looks well-maintained and presentable all year long.

Facebook Twitter Google + Email Print Simon says By Bernie Becker 05/22/2017 10:00 AM EDT THE DAY BEFORE THE STORM: Get fully hydrated, because Washington’s tax cadre is going to be stretched pretty thin on Tuesday. For starters, there’s that long-awaited House Ways and Means hearing on the already well-debated border adjustment. Pro Tax got a little sneak peek at the witness list, which is expected to be officially announced later today, and the choices seem to check most of the boxes you’d expect. Story Continued Below There’s a business executive whose company would probably get a boost from a border adjustment (Juan Luciano, chief executive of the agribusiness Archer Daniels Midland), and another from the retailers who have viewed the House GOP blueprint as an existential threat (Brian Cornell, the Target CEO.) You’ve got someone from the D.C. economist class (Larry Lindsey), which has a fair number of members backing the border adjustment, and another economist who is a progressive skeptic (Kimberly Clausing from Reed College.) And then there’s Bill Simon, the former Walmart U.S. chief, who has always been among the more intriguing advocates for the border adjustment. (He called the opposition of his former retail brethren “hysterical,” and we don’t think he meant hilarious or funny.) But there’s even more: Simon is on the board of Chico’s, the women’s clothing chain that has come out against the border adjustment, so he’ll be testifying in direct opposition to a company from which he presumably draws a check. A Chico’s spokeswoman would only say: “While we respect Mr. Simon's opinions, he is not testifying as a representative of Chico's FAS. His views on this matter do not reflect our views on the proposed border adjustment tax and how it would impact Chico's FAS.” Asked if Chico’s took issue with Simon testifying, Jessica Wells, the spokeswoman, added simply: "Chico's FAS remains steadfast in our belief that the proposed border adjustment tax would unfairly hurt consumers and retailers. Mr. Simon's views are his own.” The broader question probably is whether a hearing can jolt a debate that’s been pretty gridlocked for awhile. Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Texas) has made it clear he doesn’t want to back away from the border adjustment, and is open to some modifications. But there’s also really no appetite for the idea in the Senate — which, to be fair, hasn’t exactly been tossing out a ton of (or much of any) alternatives. Something else to watch: How the skeptics among GOP tax writers — and they definitely exist — tackle their five minutes with the microphone. Elsewhere in border adjustment land: Americans for Affordable Products, the coalition opposing the border adjustment, is announcing today that it has more than 500 members. WELL, WHO KNOWS WHAT THIS WEEK WILL BRING? On this day back in 1849, Abraham Lincoln — having just left Congress, and still more than a decade away from being elected president — received a patent after inventing a new method to lift boats over obstacles. (He remains the only president to ever get a patent.) Here’s where to find us with your tips and feedback.

DON’T FORGET THE BUDGET: President Donald Trump might be on his first foreign trip since taking office, but his team will be full speed ahead with his first full budget on Tuesday. That budget is expected to presume that an overhaul of the tax code will be revenue-neutral, as several outlets reported last week, even though Trump and several top economic and fiscal advisers have asserted they want to pass a perhaps historic tax cut. The Washington Post squared that circle over the weekend, in a broader piece about how Trump will be proposing to remake the safety net. The short answer: Trump administration officials will be relying on some pretty optimistic growth figures on taxes to help meet their deficit goals. “A key element of the budget plan will be the assumption that huge tax cuts will result in an unprecedented level of economic growth,” wrote Damian Paletta, adding that “budget experts from both parties have disputed” claims from Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and others that Trump tax cuts could spur trillions in new revenues. “The White House will use its presumed new revenue from the tax cuts combined with broad spending cuts to claim that its changes would eliminate the budget deficit over 10 years.” Related note: The Associated Press finds that GOP critics of the administration’s budget are already lining up. HEALTH CARE AS THE PREQUEL FOR TAXES: Here’s a glass half-full case for how the House’s bumpy health care process could help Republicans come together on tax reform, from Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.) as reported by Kyle Cheney and Colin Wilhelm. “Passing a health care bill forced warring factions of the House GOP conference to work together in ways they never have before. That goodwill, he said, could carry over into the next fight.” GOP leaders clearly feel they don’t have to move as quickly on taxes as they did on replacing Obamacare, and are hoping that a more by-the-book process will give their reform efforts a boost. At the same time, the House Freedom Caucus — whose members have already suggested they’ll release their own tax plan — sound confident that they’ll be able to shape whatever tax deal emerges, and some senior Republicans are concerned that hard-liners could have a lot of leverage. Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), the Freedom Caucus chairman, said he is pushing both the White House and congressional leadership to "make some very difficult decisions very quickly,” and that he “hopes the first proposal Congress considers hews toward conservatives and that then tweaks are made to corral moderates, which is how House Republicans finally pushed the AHCA over the finish line,” as Kyle and Colin put it. Reminder: The Congressional Budget Office is expected to release their new projections on the House’s American Health Care Act on Wednesday. ** A message from the American Benefits Council: Employer-sponsored retirement plans represent a cost-effective investment for our country – reducing pressure on Social Security and other direct taxpayer-funded programs. Tax policy must continue to help facilitate personal financial security for Americans at all income levels. Learn more: http://www.americanbenefitscouncil.org/ ** INTERESTING POINT: Trump rolled out some rather limited new protections this month against the Johnson Amendment, the longstanding and rarely-invoked law that bars churches from openly advocating for political candidates. And yet, would the recent GOP tax reform proposals have a more profound impact on religious institutions, should some amalgamation of them become law? The Washington Post makes that argument, based on the fact that plans from both the White House and House Republicans would greatly expand the standard deduction and lower tax rates. Charitable advocates argue that, while such a move would likely streamline the tax code, it would also lead to fewer donations. (Both plans would keep the deduction for charitable contributions, but far fewer taxpayers would itemize.) A new study from Indiana University’s Lilly Family School of Philanthropy found that congregations could see donations fall by close to 5 percent under that scenario. TAX CUTS? HOW ABOUT THE OPPOSITE: The Financial Times’ opinion section has a reminder that there are still a whole lot of people (many of them called Democrats) who want the U.S. to raise taxes. The case from Rana Foroohar, an FT columnist, is that Americans have no issue paying taxes, but do care that the system is fair. And: “If the past few decades have shown us anything, it is that, as the rich have got richer, they have not created higher trend growth for the economy overall. In the 1950s, the top marginal tax rate for individuals was 90 per cent and the corporate rate was over 50 per cent. Today, the corporate rate is roughly 35 per cent (most companies pay far less) and the individual rate 39.6 per cent. Yet real per capita gross domestic product is growing about half as fast. That is why some economists and policymakers are beginning to consider a radical idea: not only are higher taxes not bad for the economy, they may even be good for it.” INTERNATIONAL UPDATE THAT’S QUITE A CHANGE: India, with the third-largest economy in Asia and the fastest-growing major economy in the world, is inching ever closer to implementing its broadest tax overhaul since becoming independent seven decades ago. And there will be plenty of changes, as Bloomberg notes: “The finance ministry on Friday released detailed rates for the incoming goods and services tax, slotting more than 1,200 items — from sugar to steel pipes and motorcycles — into five tax brackets between zero and 28 percent. With that done, India is almost ready to implement a tax code that unifies more than a dozen separate levies, effectively creating a single market with a population greater than the U.S., Europe, Brazil, Mexico and Japan combined.” The hope for Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his government is that the new tax code will help bring large portions of the Indian economy out of the shadows, allowing for new investments in infrastructure and other initiatives. But while the rates announced Friday were fairly moderate, Bloomberg notes that the scheduled rollout date of July 1 looks pretty unrealistic. STATE NEWS TWO AND TWO DEFINITELY NOW FOUR: For years, one of the hardest parts about figuring out how much states and localities were handing out in corporate tax incentives is that those governments weren’t universally required to report that information. But the Associated Press notes that’s changing now, thanks to the nonprofit Government Accounting Standards Board, which started requiring that information be reported in 2016. Now, states, counties, cities and others have to announce how many tax abatement programs they have, plus “the amount of tax revenue foregone and the value of any non-tax commitments, such as land purchases or utility structures, they had agreed to contribute in order to seal the deals,” as the AP noted. One bump along the road: the board had to clarify that governments had to report tax increment financing districts, which have been used to develop malls and other projects around the country. QUICK LINKS Some Republicans want House Oversight Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), on his way out of Congress, to give up his gavel sooner rather than later. It’s a tax battle among Texas Republicans. DID YOU KNOW? Sierra Nevada Brewing Co., based in Chico, Calif., had the third highest sales volume among craft beer brewers in 2016. ** A message from the American Benefits Council: Employer-sponsored retirement plans cover more than 90 million people, with assets totaling $8 trillion. These tax-favored savings represent a cost-effective investment for our country – reducing pressure on Social Security and other direct taxpayer-funded programs. Retirement-related tax policy should also permit advance-funding for retiree health care, disability and long-term care. Enhancing the Savers Credit, excluding future retirement benefits when determining housing or food subsidies, lowering to age 45 eligibility for "catch up" contributions and increasing contribution limits would help facilitate personal financial security for Americans at all income levels.

Sunday (Josh Redsun/Daily Republic) Solano County Students help animals and community with project By Susan Hiland From page A3 | May 22, 2017 ShareTweet ShareTweet VACAVILLE — Caroline Chouvinard, a junior at Armijo High School, is a dog lover who wants to do something for animals but she is too young to work at a rescue center. So she came up with a solution that is part school project, part community project and an animal helper. Since December, she has been hatching a project for her International Baccalaureate certificate, which has several requirements. One of those is community activity service. “Students feel that they can’t make a difference in animal rescue because you have to be 18 years old to do it,” Chouvinard said. “So I organized a Walk for Pets.” With the help of a group of volunteers, they organized the walk, Saturday, at Lagoon Valley Park at Pena Adobe. She wanted it to be more than just a two-mile walk around the lagoon but an event that would grab people’s interest. To that end, the group went out and found local businesses to sponsor the walk including Target, Walmart and Pawish, to name just a few. They got gift cards donated for a goodie bag she put together with dog biscuits, pop-up bowl and a poo bag dispenser. Her friend, Hannah Wolf, came out with a keyboard and sang for the group. They asked for donations from participants and started a fund to gather the money, which will be split between several pet organizations in the area, including the Solano County SPCA, Solano Animal Care, and Saving Gracie Foundation in Vacaville. Saving Gracie Foundation is a non-profit organization (501c3) with a goal to provide life-saving treatment to pets in the Solano County community. The walk had about 40 people who came with dogs for the event but more people pledged money online that didn’t come out for the walk. “We brought in about $800,” she said. Lynne Herring, a teacher at Armijo High School, brought her dog, Babette, out to show her support for the fundraiser, even though she wasn’t a part of it. “I don’t always get to do it but it was a great day to do it,” Herring said. Chouvinard has big plans for her project and this is in no way a one time deal, she said. “I wanted to do a pet adoption along with the walk, but the organization couldn’t do it,” she said. “But next year we are going to work out the dates so we can do that.” Along with raising money and pet adoptions, she wants to see more communities in the area start a Walk for Pets event with t-shirts and more. “My goal is to have this spread. I live in Martinez and I want to see it there, too,” she said. Even after she graduates she wants the upcoming students to continue her work. “I was surprised by the support we got,” she said. “But people are eager to help out, and Facebook pages make it easier. People don’t realize it, but it isn’t hard to help out animals.” Reach Susan Hiland at 427-6981 or [email protected] ShareTweet ShareTweet Susan Hiland Susan graduated from Southern Oregon University in Ashland, Oregon with a B.A. in Communications.

Plus: Get the Mass Effect trilogy for just $5! Laptops by Rick Broida May 22, 2017 5:32 AM PDT @cheapskateblog CNET's Cheapskate scours the web for great deals on PCs, phones, gadgets and much more. Questions about the Cheapskate blog? Find the answers on our FAQ page. And find more great buys on the CNET Deals page. Lenovo Good heavens, we are all spoiled rotten. Information at our fingertips, computing powerhouses in our pockets, laptops for $129. Think about this last for a second. A mere 25 years ago, an IBM ThinkPad would have cost you $2,375 (or around $4,000 in inflation-adjusted dollars). And it would have been a heavy, bulky slowpoke with a small, grayscale screen. Just 20 years ago, a color laptop -- the Gateway Solo, for example -- cost over $6,000 (inflation-adjusted). Ten years ago, a Dell XPS cost around $3,300. Not that you couldn't buy a laptop for less, but it's easy to forget how expensive they used to be. Today, this: Walmart has the Lenovo N22 11.6-inch Chromebook for $129 shipped (plus tax). Come on! This is the machine you buy for a kid who needs a laptop, the one who's heading off to middle school in the fall or needs something a little better than the aging hand-me-down you bought four years ago. It's no powerhouse, but it's powerful enough, with an Intel Celeron processor, 4GB of RAM (one would expect 2GB at this price point) and 16GB of expandable storage. Whoa, that's not much, right? Keep in mind this is a Chromebook, so it's designed to store schoolwork and other documents in Google's cloud. That said, you can easily (and inexpensively) devote one of the N22's two USB 3.0 ports to a full-time flash drive -- like this SanDisk 32GB Ultra Fit drive for $14.39. (Don't get me started on how cheap that is.) Lenovo packs in a few other amenities as well, including a webcam that can rotate up and down, a water-resistant keyboard and a battery that's good for up to 10 hours of runtime. The N22 also offers Bluetooth 4.0 and all the Wi-Fis: 802.11a/b/g/n/ac. It weighs 2.8 pounds. The Mass Effect trilogy is on sale for just $5! BioWare Not too shabby for $129, am I right? The one caveat I have is printing: Your student will almost certainly need to do some, so you'll need to make sure you have a Google Cloud Print-compatible printer. (See "How to print from a Chromebook" to learn more.) Your thoughts? Bonus deal: Game time! If you never played the Mass Effect series, you missed on some truly epic action-RPG sci-fi goodness. You also saved yourself a boatload of money, because for a limited time, Cdkeys has the Mass Effect Trilogy (PC) for $5.19. Over at Steam, just the first two games alone would run you $40. (Mass Effect 3 isn't even available there.) This deal nets you redemption keys for Origin, though, not Steam -- meaning you'll need an Origin account and the client software. The three games debuted in 2007, 2010 and 2012, and all earned top marks from GameSpot (among other sites). Check out this review of Mass Effect 3, just to get the flavor. I don't know how much longer the trilogy will be available at this price (I first spotted it yesterday), but I do know it's a killer deal on three phenomenal PC games. Don't miss it!

The auto industry alone is set to increase demand for OBL fuel 11 times over its current production levels. Energy Breakthrough: One gallon of this new "crystal fuel" could get you from New York to L.A. and back… seven times! Read more… And the auto industry isn't the only one rushing to secure sources of OBL. Companies such as Alphabet Inc. (Nasdaq: GOOG) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE: WMT) are looking to independently produce the energy needed to power their offices and stores. OBL fuel is so powerful that it is becoming a large part of those corporate energy independence plans. With large corporations flocking to OBL fuel, demand is soaring, creating a huge profit opportunity… Securing Profits from OBL High demand and a scarcity of the crystals have the potential for this energy play to become larger than the fracking boom. In the last 14 months, OBL has doubled in price twice. With prices climbing that fast, it's easy to see how you can print money by securing a claim to OBL fuel. And that is exactly what a tiny little miner has done. It secured a claim in Death Valley potentially worth more than $20 billion. To make the profit opportunity even better, this miner has claims outside of Death Valley as well. With so much control over the supply, this tiny company is set to explode, giving early investors the opportunity to create generational wealth.

"Following" : "Follow"}} May 22, 2017 8:25am   Comments Share: Benzinga has featured a look at many investor favorite stocks over the past week. Earnings reports from big retailers brought plenty of attention on retail stocks. And cybersecurity concerns put a spotlight on technology stocks. This past week, the markets saw their worst day so far this year, as volatility has spiked. Growing concerns that tax reform and other economic growth initiatives may not happen this year get part of the blame. Meanwhile, earnings reports from big retailers continued to highlight the ongoing woes in that sector, though there were a few bright spots. Among the investor favorite stocks featured by Benzinga during the past week, the retail industry was again well represented. And the huge ransomware attack that began the week also brought some focus on the technology sector. Retail "Retail Wars Move From Online To In-Store AsWal-Mart Tests Cashierless Store To Rival Amazon" by Shanthi Rexaline takes a look at how one retailer is gearing up to take on the rivalry posed by online behemoth Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN). See the new approach that Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE: WMT) says it will try at two of its supercenters. In "The Difference A Year Makes: Analyst Who Upgraded JC Penney A Year Ago 'Recalibrates' Expectations," Shanthi Rexaline examines why the analysts at Baird have changed their mind about J C Penney Company Inc (NYSE: JCP), even if "we continue to believe management has put JCP on a better path." Dustin Blitchok's "Baird Finds Reasons For Investor Patience With Urban Outfitters" discusses why even though Urban Outfitters, Inc. (NASDAQ: URBN) first-quarter earnings were a disappointment, the stock could represent a long-term value in the troubled apparel and retail sector, according to one analyst. Also check out "Retail Analyst Says Target Isn't Out Of The Woods Just Yet. Technology The corporate world is in the process of making a major shift toward security-defined networks, according to "Cisco Systems Offers An Opportunity To Invest In A Cybersecurity Paradigm Shift" by Wayne Duggan. See why Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ: CSCO) could be uniquely-positioned to benefit from that shift. In Mark Fritz's "Nvidia Will Maintain 'Dominant Market Share' Thanks To New Volta Chip," see why the new NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) GPU chip for data center customers should protect the company's dominant market share against the Vega chip of rival AMD. "The Sell-Side View On Advanced Micro Devices' Analyst Day" by Wayne Duggan discusses why Wall Street analysts were disappointed by the Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD)'s Analyst Day event last week. Key themes from analysts at Deutsche Bank, Oppenheimer and others include the competitive environment and low expectations.

(Reuters/Kai Pfaffenbach) Share Written by Sarah Kessler May 22, 2017 “I’ve seen people pass out, hit the floor like a pancake, and smash their face open,” a worker at Tesla’s “factory of the future” told the Guardian in a report published this week. “They just send us to work around him while he’s still lying on the floor.” The Guardian report described long hours and intense pressure to meet CEO Elon Musk’s production goals–even if that means enduring or ignoring injuries. Since 2014, according to the report, hundreds of ambulances have been called to the factory to treat workers. This portrayal doesn’t quite jive with Musk’s world-changing vision. And Tesla isn’t only Silicon Valley company facing this type of irony. Technology companies’ reputations as employers often stem from how they treat highly paid engineers, but many also employ thousands of blue collar workers. Tech workers at these companies receive high pay, elaborate perks, and progressive workplace policies, but blue collar workers for the same companies often work in circumstances that look much less innovative. The tech industry’s non-tech workforce At Facebook, a team of 7,000 human moderators police content by reviewing the worst that humanity has to offer. At Amazon, more than 90,000 full-time employees in 70 warehouses pick and pack orders for delivery (a workforce that more than doubles with temporary workers during busy seasons). Uber’s algorithms direct massive armies of human drivers, and Tesla employs about 10,000 workers in its car manufacturing plant in Fremont, California. The humans who moderate content have jobs that involve watching violence and child pornography. They report psychological damage, including a condition similar to PTSD (two former Microsoft content moderators recently sued the company for not providing psychological support), and often are hired as contractors rather than employees. A Buzzfeed News report last year found working conditions at Blue Apron, a tech company that makes meal kits, led to high stress and even violence as the company rushed to scale operations. Horror stories occasionally emerge from Amazon warehouses, where workers walk up to 12 miles in a shift and must meet minimum productivity requirements. The company also runs a platform called Mechanical Turk on which workers complete small, repetitive tasks for cents, which has inspired a new category of ethical questions. Uber drivers, who are not employees of the company, report misleading promises and unpredictable wages. Technology companies should start at home These are certainly not the worst jobs in the world. Amazon warehouse workers, for instance, have jobs not unlike those at more traditional logistics companies and at the warehouses of older retailers, like Walmart. According to thousands of salaries reported to the jobs site Indeed.com, Amazon’s warehouse workers make on average about $12 per hour, which differs based on location. Walmart recently said that it was raising its hourly pay floor to $10, and that its average workers make $10 (part-time) and $13 (full-time) per hour. Outside of new technology companies, you’ll also find plenty of health and safety violations much, much, much worse than those at Tesla factories and Blue Apron assembly plants, and tech is not alone in using contractors instead of employees wherever possible. Even Facebook content work, which involves spotting beheadings and child pornography, doesn’t seem so bad compared to global sweat shop conditions. But unlike companies in most other industries, tech has positioned itself as a visionary, progressive driver of positive world change. Mark Zuckerberg recently released a manifesto describing how Facebook can improve everything from global safety to civic engagement. Elon Musk seems to have chosen his company ideas from a list of world problems, and a Jeff Bezos quote on an Amazon recruitment page professes that “success is measured against the possible, not the probable.” Why not take this big thinking to the problem of improving jobs for their own hourly workers? Many technology companies have already applied their progressive thinking to their white collar jobs. Facebook has been a pioneer of family friendly policies, and Google has considered the health of its white collar workforce down to the size of their cafeteria plates. Sure, these considerations are driven by competition for hiring and retaining software engineers, but there are also financial advantages to investing in blue collar workers. A recent study by researchers at Dartmouth College and the University of Wisconsin, for instance, found that experienced workers at warehouses with the type of storage system Amazon uses were significantly faster than less-experienced workers. That may be one reason that Amazon has offered benefits such as on-site classrooms at its fulfillment centers that make it easier for workers to go back to school and paid leave that can be shared with a spouse or domestic partner in some circumstances. When it comes to physical or labor-intensive work, Silicon Valley tends to tout its technology. Tesla has its automation-heavy “factory of the future,” Uber invests in automated vehicles, Facebook is building algorithms that can police its content without human moderators, and Amazon is building machines that pack boxes and drones that deliver them. These technologies have the potential to improve jobs. They could also result in fewer of them. But for the foreseeable future, blue collar workers will have a role in powering even the most futuristic technology companies. Companies like GM and Walmart helped establish standard working conditions for workers in their respective industries, and the technology companies disrupting those industries today will help establish working conditions for the future. Update: This article has been edited to include examples of benefits at Amazon warehouses.

Curtain Call Is Latest Victory For Animal Welfare Activists By Greg Allen • 20 hours ago TweetShareGoogle+Email View Slideshow 1 of 3 Protesters with People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), including a costumed tiger, gathered at City Hall in Los Angeles last year to call on the city to prohibit circuses from using tigers, lions, and other wild animals in their acts. Circuses have been a target of PETA since it was founded in 1980. Richard Vogel / AP View Slideshow 2 of 3 SeaWorld ended its long-running killer whale show after criticism that the whales suffered and became violent in captivity. Chris Park / AP View Slideshow 3 of 3 A pamphlet showing an image of Cecil the lion at a vigil in central London last year. After Cecil was killed by an American dentist and trophy hunter in Zimbabwe, the lion's story went viral online. Daniel Leal-Olivas / AFP/Getty Images Listen Listening... / Originally published on May 21, 2017 6:31 pm When Feld Entertainment, owners of Ringling Bros., announced it's cancelling the circus after nearly 150 years, it was one of the biggest victories yet for animal welfare activists. How the circus treats it animals — especially elephants and big cats — has long been a focus for groups like the Humane Society of the U.S and People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. They see it as part of a larger change going on in this country — about how Americans view animals and the way we treat them. If you've gone to the circus in recent years, you probably saw them. At one protest outside the Ringling Brothers circus in Phoenix earlier this year, people shouted "Boycott the circus." PETA was founded in 1980 and "Ringling Brothers was a target of ours from the very beginning," said Lisa Lange, senior vice president of communications. She believes the protests played a key role in changing public attitudes about the circus. In announcing the end, Feld Entertainment chairman Kenneth Feld acknowledged the decades of conflict with animal welfare groups. But he said the decision was made because of declining attendance and a change in public taste. "Yes, people no longer have a taste for that kind of entertainment," Lange said. "But we believe it's because they now know what that kind of entertainment costs those animals." The demise of the Ringling Brothers circus comes just months after SeaWorld agreed to stop breeding its captive orcas and to move away from its signature theatrical shows. Around the same time, the National Aquarium in Baltimore announced it was closing its dolphin exhibit and would move its dolphins to an ocean sanctuary. "It's happening across the economy. It's happening across our culture," said Wayne Pacelle of the Humane Society. He believes a major change is going on in how Americans view animal welfare issues. "We're really seeing a rising tide of consciousness when it comes to the treatment of animals." Animal welfare groups have seen success in many other areas as well. In the last few years, major pork producers have eliminated confinement pens for pregnant sows. Egg producers have also begun getting rid of cages for their chickens. Pacelle says some of this has been accomplished through legislation. In other cases, change has been pushed by retailers like McDonald's and Wal-Mart. "In most cases, companies are now adapting," he said. "They're simply changing the way they do business to reflect a growing consciousness about animals and wringing the animal cruelty out of the business model." Lisa Lange of PETA says after decades of working on animal rights, she believes the movement has finally hit the mainstream. She believes a major factor is the power of social media. We have the ability to show people a video of elephants for example being beaten behind the scenes at a Ringling Brothers performance. And we put that up on our Facebook page, Instagram, we tweet it out. And millions of people see that video within hours. Pacelle cites a powerful example — the death of Cecil the lion. For years, the Humane Society worked to stop trophy hunting of lions, elephants and other big game with limited success. But two years ago, when a Minnesota dentist killed a lion in Zimbabwe named Cecil, the story went viral. One brave Zimbabwean activist got a hold of the image of the grinning hunters over the slain lion and, within 24 hours, more than a billion people had seen it. Soon, all the major air carriers had agreed to ban shipment of lion, elephant, rhino and other large animal trophies worldwide. Pacelle believes concern about animal welfare is now a value shared by all Americans. The question is what that will mean next for agriculture, entertainment, research, and other fields in which animals play a role. Copyright 2017 NPR. To see more, visit http://www.npr.org/. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST: Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Bailey Circus performs its final show in New York City this evening, capping off a nearly 150-year run. And while many are sorry to see the circus close, animal welfare activists are counting this as a major victory. The Humane Society of the United States and the people for the Ethical Treatment of Animals see the closing as part of a broader trend in the way Americans think about animals and treat them.

ALLEN: That's from a protest outside the Ringling Brothers Circus when it was in Phoenix earlier this year. In January when Feld Entertainment said this would be the Ringling Brothers' last season, animal welfare groups cheered. The circus and how it treats its animals, especially elephants and big cats, has long been a focus for the groups. LISA LANGE: PETA was founded in 1980 and Ringling Brothers was a target of ours from the very beginning. ALLEN: Lisa Lange with PETA, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, believes the protests played a key role in changing public attitudes about the circus. In announcing the end, Feld Entertainment chairman Kenneth Feld acknowledged the decades of conflict with animal welfare groups. But he said the decision was made because of declining attendance and a change in public taste. Here's Lange. LANGE: Yes. People no longer have a taste for that kind of entertainment, but we believe it's because they now know what that kind of entertainment cost those animals. ALLEN: The demise of the Ringling Brothers' circus comes just months after SeaWorld agreed to stop breeding its captive orcas and to move away from its signature theatrical shows around the same time the National Aquarium in Baltimore announced it was closing its dolphin exhibit and would move its dolphins to an ocean sanctuary. Wayne Pacelle of the Humane Society of the U.S. believes a major change is going on in how Americans view animal welfare issues. WAYNE PACELLE: It's happening across the economy. It's happening across our culture, and we're really seeing a rising tide of consciousness when it comes to the treatment of animals. ALLEN: Animal welfare groups have seen success in many other areas as well. In the last few years, major pork producers have eliminated confinement pens for pregnant sows. Egg producers have also begun getting rid of cages for their chickens. Pacelle says some of this has been accomplished through legislation. In other cases, change had been pushed by retailers like McDonald's and Wal-Mart. PACELLE: In most cases, companies are now adapting. They're simply changing the way they do business to reflect a greater consciousness about animals and ringing the animal cruelty out of the business model. ALLEN: Lisa Lange of PETA says after decades of working on animal rights, she believes the movement has finally hit the mainstream. A major factor she believes is the power of social media. LANGE: We have the ability to show people a video of elephants, for example, being beaten behind the scenes at a Ringling Brothers' performance, and we put that up on our Facebook page, Instagram. We tweet it out and millions of people see that video within hours. ALLEN: Pacelle cites a powerful example, the death of Cecil the lion. For years, the Humane Society worked to stop trophy hunting of lions, elephants and other big game with limited success. But two years ago when a Minnesota dentist killed a lion in Zimbabwe named Cecil, Pacelle recalls it went viral. PACELLE: Many of these things go unnoticed, but one brave Zimbabwean activist got a hold of the image of the grinning hunters over the slain lion. And within 24 hours, more than a billion people had seen it. ALLEN: Soon, all the major air carriers had agreed to ban shipment of lion, elephant, rhino and other large animal trophies worldwide. Pacelle believes concern about animal welfare is now a value shared by all Americans. The question is what that will mean for agriculture, entertainment, research and other fields in which animals play a role? Greg Allen, NPR News. Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR.

Menu Home Politics Policy Opinion & Analysis Video Gonzales Heard on the Hill Events Hawkings White House Search May 23, 2017 Politics How the Koch Network Could Sink Tax Overhaul Lobbying network poised for policy win Posted May 22, 2017 5:00 AM Kate Ackley @Kate Ackley Supreme Court Affirms Ban on ‘Soft Money’ in Campaigns Critics Call Trump Election Panel a ‘Sham’ Ryan to Sell Tax Overhaul Benefits in Ohio Save for later WASHINGTON, DC - NOVEMBER 04: Americans for Prosperity Foundation chairman and Koch Industries Executive Vice President David H. Koch (C) listens to speakers during the Defending the American Dream Summit at the Washington Convention Center November 4, 2011 in Washington, DC. The conservative political summit is organized by Americans for Prosperity, which was founded with the support of Koch and his brother David H. Koch. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) Kate Ackley @Kate Ackley Posted May 22, 2017 5:00 AM Save for later The lobbying and political network of Charles and David Koch, bogeymen to Democrats for years, is poised for a significant policy win — but it will come at the expense of fellow conservatives on Capitol Hill. Their victory also could derail a policy goal they share with those same Republican lawmakers: a permanent comprehensive overhaul of the nation’s tax code. Koch Industries and the network of conservative advocacy groups funded by the billionaire brothers, such as Americans for Prosperity, have spent months working to tear down a crucial element of the House GOP leaders’ tax blueprint, which would impose a new levy on imports. The tax is best known as a border adjustment, and it would help raise more than $1 trillion over 10 years to fund a big corporate tax cut. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin and Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady of Texas say their proposal to tax imports but exempt exports would lure more companies to manufacture in the United States. Though the House committee will hold its first hearing on the border adjustment tax Tuesday, it may already be dead. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said just days ago that the proposal probably wouldn’t pass his chamber, though the Kentucky Republican noted that talks continued. The Trump administration hasn’t maligned the idea, and even Ryan conceded lawmakers are discussing alternatives. Brady has talked of phasing in the border adjustment tax over time. [Five Questions Key to Passage of the GOP’s Tax Overhaul] The Koch network, along with a robust, multimillion-dollar opposition campaign from the retail industry, has helped convince a number of Republicans that the BAT would result in higher prices for U.S. consumers. In short, the Kochs have successfully divided members of the party they are most closely associated with politically. Retailers say the conservative groups, led by the Koch network, give their cause a boost and complement their own intense effort that has included multiple trips to Washington with CEOs of Wal-Mart, Target and other stores. The broader business lobby in Washington, meanwhile, is largely silent because of internal conflict. “They have an approach to this that is more ideological or more philosophical,” said David French, the top lobbyist for the National Retail Federation, which considers fighting the border adjustment proposal its No. 1 issue. “They bring a healthy skepticism to the growth of government spending.” In an effort to be for something, rather than just against border adjustments, Koch-affiliated groups announced a new advocacy effort this month to buoy a tax overhaul effort that does not include the centerpiece of the House GOP plan. The Koch network is not new to the tax debate. It has been working to tear down the BAT since late last year after the November election results catapulted the House GOP tax blueprint from the realm of legislative fantasy to being the plan itself. “Our policy team understood very quickly that it was, in fact, a tariff on imported goods,” said Tim Phillips, who runs Americans for Prosperity. Proponents of the border adjustment concept strongly disagree with that characterization and say it would end tax incentives for moving production abroad or keeping offshore profits out of the United States. Brady, for one, said it would reverse current policies that favor foreign products and hurt Americans by driving “businesses and jobs overseas.” It’s also a way to pay for a sweeping tax overhaul, which aims to lower the average corporate rate to 20 percent, without ballooning the deficit. The influence of the Koch advocacy nonprofits comes largely from an organized grass-roots operation around the country, as opposed to paid K Street lobbying. Americans for Prosperity reported a sharp uptick in its federal lobbying tab in the first quarter of 2017, but it still was only $40,000. [K Street Offers Five Tips for Tax Overhaul] Both Koch Industries and the outside groups have shared or produced studies that aim to show the downside of the border adjustment proposal, specifically the projected higher costs to consumers, even if those costs might eventually even out with an expected higher value of the dollar. Koch Industries, which imports crude oil, may see some of its costs rise under the proposal, but a spokesman for the company said its own internal analysis found that, overall, the company’s bottom line would actually benefit from the BAT. The company has a problem on ideological grounds. “We are opposed because we think it’s bad policy,” said company spokesman David Dziok. Koch Industries was one of the first major companies to come out in strong opposition to the BAT with a statement on Dec. 7. Dziok said the for-profit corporation was in agreement with the advocacy groups, such as Americans for Prosperity, but were not working in collaboration. For its part, AFP has run cable and digital ads against the border adjustment proposal. “It’s safe to say it’s been a seven-figure effort in total, so far,” Phillips said. “It’s been more than just ads. Our state directors and activists back home have met with a number of House members.” AFP’s activists have also come to Capitol Hill. They’ve met with lawmakers from Ohio, North Carolina, Florida and Virginia, among others. The Libre Initiative, the Koch affiliate that focuses on Hispanic outreach, has done interviews and ads in Spanish and English, said group spokeswoman Marilinda Garcia. Generation Opportunity, the millennial-focused advocacy arm of the Koch network, too, made its own pitch against the border adjustment tax with a Facebook Live event on Valentine’s Day where it featured imported chocolate, wine and other staples of the holiday that it said would be more expensive under the proposal, said David Barnes, director of policy engagement. The free-market Mercatus Center at George Mason University was also an early and vocal font of opposition to the BAT. Charles Koch is a member of the Mercatus board. “For me, it was completely independent of the retailers or even that of Koch,” said Mercatus’ Veronique de Rugy, who has written extensively against the proposal, including a National Review article from Nov. 30. “The pro-BAT side wasn’t prepared at all. They didn’t think about the optics.” A longtime supporter of the border adjustment proposal, academic Alan Auerbach of the University of California, Berkeley, admits to being caught off guard by the intense opposition. “I must say, as someone who has favored this idea for a long time, I was quite surprised,” the economics professor said. “I guess I shouldn’t have been because there’s a lot of money at stake.” Get breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call on your iPhone or your Android.

The answer’s yes.” —Eminem, “Criminal” Here is what it meant to be a man if you were a certain type of boy in the United States: if you were, as I suppose I was, a child of the ‘90s, an accidental legatee of America’s late-century traumas and shibboleths, moral panics and incidental neuroses; if you were, as I suppose I was, a son of the South, a student of flash floods and late afternoon cloud formations, whose happiness could be most intelligibly derived in the censored light of the sun, in the postdrome of a thunderstorm, in front of a rain puddle, wading an empty two-liter bottle with the Coca-Cola label scratched off, fishing for tadpoles; and if you were, as I suppose I was, a boy for whom melancholy could be said to “come easily”, a boy for whom softness and tenderness were not aspirational conditions but the general alignment, or what they now euphemize on MTV as a “creature of sensitivity”. Here is what it meant to be a man if you were a certain type of boy in the United States and MTV had not yet incorporated into its Viacom production notes a habit of euphemizing you as a “creature of sensitivity”. It meant: a debt to be paid, to be settled at a later date. It was the last summer of the Clinton administration, and to a child whose understanding of the world had come almost entirely by way of comparison to a past pockmarked by absence—the absence of TV, the absence of refrigeration, the absence of civil rights—modernity seemed like it had more or less “worked out”: that humanity could stall here, and it would more or less stay the same. Any disappointment we might have about how the modern world turned out, well, we would just have to get used to. My family and I had just moved from Alabama, where we had grown familiarly adjusted to the rhythms and contours of living in a small city, the gambol of church bells on Sunday morning. Houston had the unwieldiness of a casino floor at the Venetian at 11PM on New Year’s Eve, with the added qualification that nobody ever seemed happy to be there, wherever they were, at any given time. I watched them from the bus window (it was always a bus window) on Old Spanish Trail, coming out of the tattoo parlors, the secondhand furniture shops, the Fiesta Marts, the heat baking their skin into a uniform shade of umber. I waited for the day I would become an adult and trade places with them. Accompanying me on those long afternoon bus rides would be a silver portable CD player, and a white CD emblazoned with a paragraph-long copyright notice, a pixelated image of a white man in a white t-shirt and a dark baseball cap, and the letter “E” printed in bold, large-point, Helvetica-family type; upside-down. With some effort I can also remember that these consumer goods had been purchased for me by my mother at Wal-Mart for the grand total of $50, or one-eighth of her weekly salary. It occurs to me now how little of what we retain from childhood are the so-called “important things” are the appropriate highlights and annotations, is the so-called “point”: that the substance of nostalgia tends to have as its preeminent constituent mundane details, the way the sun bounces off the face of a clock in the living room as your father beats your mother in the bedroom, “trivialities”. For instance, a triviality: the man in the pixelated image on the front of the CD was holding in his hands what appeared to be a dark suitcase and a white plastic bag. Another triviality: “This is another public service announcement brought to you in part by Slim Shady”, was how the first track began. “Slim Shady does not give a fuck what you think. If you don’t like it, you can suck his fucking cock. Little did you know, upon purchasing this album, you have just kissed his ass. Slim Shady is fed up with your shit. And he’s going to kill you.” The details are familiar. “Slim Shady” was born Marshall Bruce Mathers III to a 17-year-old single mother named Deborah Rae Nelson in 1972, would shuttle between working-class homes in Missouri and Michigan before spending the preponderance of his adolescence at 19946 Dresden Street, three blocks south of East 8 Mile Road, in a predominantly black neighborhood on the east side of Detroit. The details are familiar to us not only because “Marshall Mathers” is the name on the titles of two of his eight solo albums and “19946 Dresden Street” is the address of the house featured on the covers of both of those albums and “Deborah Rae Nelson,” as drug-addicted mother, is one of the leitmotifs that feature most prominently in his discography, with a starring role in one hit single (“Cleanin’ Out My Closet”) and direct shout-outs in at least two more (“My Name Is,” “Without Me”). The details are familiar to us because in his music and in his album covers and in his public persona and in even the title of a 2002 semi-biographical film, and with a self-preoccupation that would strike us today as distinctly if not archetypically “millennial,” the details of Eminem’s life have been reconfigured into art: and his art, for the last two decades, has enjoyed a reverence and esteem within the famously conservative confines of our national culture that in many ways has been miraculous, even singular. His 2000 album—or what I now understand to be his third, but which I cannot help but think of as his sophomore effort—The Marshall Mathers LP, is one of only four albums since 2000 to sell over 30 million copies (the other three are: Adele’s 21, a compilation album by the Beatles, and Eminem’s own follow-up to The Marshall Mathers LP, 2002’s The Eminem Show). He is, at the time of this writing, the best-selling male artist of the fledgling century. Please don’t ad block PopMatters. We are wholly independent, with no corporate backers. Simply whitelisting PopMatters is a show of support. Thank you. I was first introduced to Eminem at the age of ten by—although the term strikes me now as fundamentally dubious as any other impression I might have formed about the world at the age of ten—my first “friend” in Houston: a half-British, half-Japanese boy named, improbably, Clifford. Cliff challenged me, had a way with words that would take me a few more years to recognize as a way with words which had the consequence of coarsening certain defenses while seducing certain others into softening. “What do you think of Eminem?” I recall Cliff asking me one afternoon toward the end of science class, as our teacher busied herself with grading and we were left to our own amusement. I told him I did not know who that was. “Don’t you listen to hip hop?” would be his next question, and I told him I did not. “So what do you listen to then?” he tried again, and I told him that I listened to a bit of everything. (I somehow had the foresight not to tell him that the most I knew about music was from the oldies station that our sixth-grade teacher sometimes had on in the morning before the bell rang for homeroom.) “Colson,” Cliff said, “let me offer you some friendly advice. When someone wants to know what kind of music you like, never tell them everything. Saying everything just makes it sound like you don’t know shit about anything. Now check this out,” he added, retrieving from inside his blue JanSport backpack a CD case. I looked at the CD cover, at the sepia-toned portrait of an artist as a young man sitting with his head lowered on the stoop of a clapboard house. “Now this shit,” Cliff whispered, looking into my eyes. “Now this shit is dope.” Although I didn’t realize it at the time, Cliff’s voice carried enough of a British inflection to render faintly ridiculous his near-constant boasts about being “gangster,” about living in “the ghetto,” about sleeping with a “Colt Mustang” underneath his pillow and spending his Sundays at the “shooting range” with his father (although this last detail strikes me in retrospect as probably true). In fact, Clifford did not live in the ghetto but in a two-story townhouse about a mile or two from where I lived, in a lower-middle-class, predominantly Spanish-speaking suburb whose class and racial composition more or less mirrored that of my own apartment complex; I remember distinctly that his mother drove a Subaru. I mention this not to suggest that there is anything indecorous—or indeed, anomalous—about a sixth-grader engaged in the exercise of creating a persona; on the contrary, persona-building is and will remain, I think, the public exercise of our time. But what bewildered me then, and what strikes me as relevant now, is how little Cliff’s Ready to Die persona earned him in the way of social advancement; is how inelegantly Cliff’s tastes in clothes and TV and music aligned with the prevailing social character of our middle school, the majority of whom lived in suburbs which were not predominantly Spanish-speaking, whose fathers took them to Little League on Sundays and whose mothers drove them to school in Land Rovers, not Subarus. It didn’t occur to me then that “being gangster” or that “living in the ghetto” or that “sleeping with a Colt Mustang” underneath one’s pillow could have as its starting point a presumption of insolvency in any contest in which “wealth” or “whiteness” or “conversancy with upper-middle-class rituals” would be the determining factors; could have as its ambition something more vital and elemental than social success as a sixth-grader at T.H. Rogers Middle School. I have here one annotation I seem to have retained from childhood: that ten is the age by which most of us, if we are cynical enough, will have “come awake,” will have begun to look outside of ourselves and at each other in earnest to figure out what would be celebrated in this life, and what would not. We will understand with some clarity, for instance, by the age of ten, who the pretty girls are in our classrooms, and why that matters. We will understand with some clarity, for instance, by the age of ten, what sort of boy will be picked first, and last, for kickball, and why that matters. “Stop being such a little pussy, Colson,” was a sentence I would hear in my head, in Cliff’s voice, whether he was with me or not. 123Next page [The Company We Keep] Share via Topics: coming of age | eminem | homosexuality | male violence | marshall mathers | masculinity | slim shadey //related Eminem - "Phenomenal" (Singles Going Steady) Dr. Dre: Compton (take 2) Eminem and Various Artists: SHADYXV The 100 Best Albums of the 2000s: 40-21 explore Related Articles The Future Is Now, and It Is Odd: A Retrospective on Hip-hop in the '00s The Artists of the Year: 2013 Edition Eminem: The Marshall Mathers LP2 P!nk: The Truth About Love Kanrocksas Music Fest: 5-6 August 2011 - Kansas City, KS Bad Meets Evil: Hell: The Sequel Why Did Eminem Become a Corporate Whore, More?

Sharon Hillstrom, the president and chief executive officer of the Bradenton Area Economic Development Corp. Business May 21, 2017 8:35 AM Private funding can make amazing things happen around Bradenton By Sharon Hillstrom Special to the Herald LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Who would have thought that Bentonville, Ark., would become a destination for visitors interested in American art or students pursuing culinary arts? But that’s exactly what’s happening in the once-sleepy town that is home to Walmart’s corporate headquarters. I visited Bentonville last month to meet with economic development colleagues to discuss trends in community place-making and other strategies for diversifying local economies. What I saw in Bentonville validated initiatives in the Bradenton area’s strategic plan for economic development and presented exciting examples of how private funding can make amazing things happen. The project most closely aligned with our work in Manatee County was Bentonville’s focus on culinary arts as an economic driver. The nucleus for Bentonville’s culinary initiative is a former Tyson Foods factory in the central part of town where Northwest Arkansas Community College has based its culinary program. The building is in Bentonville’s Market District, one of two areas outlined in a city plan to rejuvenate Bentonville and develop its sense of place. The Market District’s focus is on food and culinary experiences. The other area is the Arts District and includes places such as galleries and studios. The vision for the Bradenton area’s culinary focus is still in formation, but our collaborative partners – which include leaders in the local food scene – imagine a market district with shopping, dining, education and training; a hub that helps local businesses related to culinary arts start up and grow. The Market District seeks to capitalize on an emerging food scene galvanized by local restaurateurs in the downtown area. Sound familiar? In the Bradenton area, we have many of the same ingredients as Bentonville, particularly the “enthusiastic entrepreneurial spirit, blossoming food scene and the prospects for community engagement in the region” that one leader in Bentonville’s culinary movement described as keys to their program. The vision for the Bradenton area’s culinary focus is still in formation, but our collaborative partners — which include leaders in the local food scene — imagine a market district with shopping, dining, education and training; a hub that helps local businesses related to culinary arts start up and grow. Our current task is to document the assets that already exist locally: culinary-related businesses, education, training, food production and supply chains. We are working with a team from the University of South Florida Sarasota-Manatee’s hospitality and business programs, Realize Bradenton and others to create an “asset map.” Then we can better define what types of projects will help to achieve the vision and we can assign a price tag to seek investment in the projects. In Bentonville, the private Walton Family Foundation stepped up with $15 million in grants to finance the community college’s expansion of its culinary program and renovation of the factory building. At the Bradenton Area Economic Development Corp., we are already developing a private-sector fundraising effort to better equip our operation for implementing aspects of our strategic plan. Realize Bradenton has successfully competed for private funding from the Knight Foundation to implement place-making projects in downtown and the Village of the Arts. There is no doubt that creating a successful market district for the Bradenton area also will require far-sighted investors willing to take a long view. Potential investors and Manatee County businesses that are interested in learning more about our local culinary district initiative can contact us at info@bradentonareaedc.com.

The first thing I learned was another developer had bid on the same project, except in a different part of town. They were going to put it up on the north side of the veterans clinic at Wilson Avenue and Wiley Boulevard. That would have been an excellent place as it is only three blocks from two grocery stores and less than a mile from Wal-Mart. Also, the Ladd Library is near. It also is a lot closer to MercyCare South than the place at 1200 Edgewood Road. I guess if you stretch the truth to the Iowa Finance Commission you can get the funding for a good project in a bad location. CommonBond put in a bunch of projects that they will supposedly pickup the tab on like a sidewalk down Crestwood Drive and a turn lane going south from Edgewood to Crestwood. I wonder if this property on Edgewood was not owned by the city if our esteemed town council would approve this location? They haven’t approved other apartment complexes, according to The Gazette. It was either Mark Twain or Will Rogers who said “If you don’t read the newspaper you are uninformed; if you do read the newspaper you are misinformed.” Do the proper thing council people and vote against this project.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 23 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman 24 great B2B and B2C brand journalism sites Advocate Heath Care is asking whether breastfed babies are smarter. Semiconductor chip maker Intel has insights on the top five most impressive game explosions. Power drink maker Red Bull wants you to know about three generations of a high-flying family and its “skytyping” business. All three are examples of a trend that has accelerated in the past six years: brand journalism sites. Recently, I was asked for stellar examples. After hitting up several experts, I offer the list below. Why practice brand journalism? Ragan Communications chief executive Mark Ragan, a former national political reporter and an early advocate of brand journalism, offers his philosophy: Stop begging the media, and become the media yourself. “Newsrooms have been decimated,” Ragan says. “If you want your company’s story told, you’d better write it or shoot it yourself. “But brand journalism works only if your story is credible, is helpful to the reader and eschews all corporate-speak and jargon. If the story is self-serving or it is designed to sell, it’s not brand journalism. It’s marketing.” (Ragan heads Ragan Consulting Group, which works with businesses to establish brand journalism sites.) From videos to white papers David Meerman Scott , another early advocate, defines brand journalism as the creation of web content—videos, blog posts, photos, charts, graphs, essays, e-books, white papers—that deliver value to the marketplace and position organizations as worthy of doing business with. “Brand journalism is not a product pitch,” he says. “It is not an advertorial. It is not an egotistical spewing of gobbledygook-laden corporate drivel.” He adds that those with the traditional skills of marketing, public relations, advertising and copywriting are not the right people to create brand journalism content. “Instead, you need the skills of a journalist,” he says. [RELATED: Learn how to infuse storytelling and great writing into all your communications at the Business Writing Summit.] Here are the sites we came up with: B2B brand journalism The good news, for a B2B company, is that you needn’t sit out this trend as flashy B2C companies like Red Bull hog the limelight. Consider the following. Cisco Systems, the networking hardware company, covers everything from innovative technology hitting the theater stage to IT that skills offer opportunities for Jordanian women. American Express’ OPEN Forum started out as a forum for small businesses, but it has grown into a leading brand journalism site. And just how is virtual reality going to shape the future of consumer experiences? IQ by Intel, in showcasing technology, offers not only the explosions article, but one on athletes and fans preparing for an e-sports competition Down Under. Adobe’s CMO will fill you in about everything from artificial intelligence to the U.S. Census Bureau, all in an effort to interest potential customers in the marketing department. Guys, HSBC Global Connections (and your female colleagues) think it’s high time you figured out “What Women Want—And What Businesses Need To Know.” GE has experimented with polished Facebook Live-casts tied to the Rio Olympics and “drome week.” If you’ve ever wondered how pilots rescue people from an avalanche in the Italian Alps, here’s where to go. UPS’ Longitudes has hosted series on trade and offers a piece titled, “3D Printing—Evolution Rather than Revolution.” Boeing has provided a wealth of stories and videos for aviation fans. A Veterans Day feature might sound internal: “Corps Education: Employees share how lessons learned during militaryservice have helped them at Boeing.” Because the aerospace company’s customers include the Pentagon and many veterans in the airlines industry, it made sense as an outward-facing story, as well. Speaking of the Pentagon, Scott recommends the U.S. military’s Armed with Science site. Where else could you find out how the military is capturing sunlight at Nellis Air Force Base? B2C brand journalism Although giant consumer brands such as Coca-Cola were pathfinders in this area, many hospitals have joined the stampede as they find the public is eager for news about health care and healthy living. Coca-Cola Journey fills us in on testing augmented reality for bottling equipment maintenance. It’s also a good place to go if you want to see how a 125-year-old company digs into its archives for interesting story ideas. (Just who was Dr. Joseph Jacobs?) The Red Bulletin stays true to its adventure-seeking theme, because after all, don’t we all feel like diving with killer whales in Norway after guzzling a sports drink? Walmart Today, which has been highlighting a major U.S. manufacturing initiative, reports on a Polish candle-making company (and Walmart supplier) that put one of its factories in the United States. Advocate’s health enews offers good-living advice from doctors, nutritionists and other experts. Advocate isn’t the only hospital in this arena. Cleveland Clinic is the granddaddy in the field, and Cape Cod Health and Health Beat at Spectrum Health provide similar information in their markets. Among other things, Cape Cod will tell you what to do if your child is a picky eater. (Ragan consulted on Advocate, Spectrum and Cape Cod Health’s sites.) The Cleveland Metropolitan School District has also jumped in on the trend, with stories such as the one on a senior who won a $40,000 scholarship in a “Stop the Hate” contest. Alberta Energy Regulator’s reSource—like Denver Water’s Tap, Duke Energy’s Illumination and Omaha Public Power District’s The Wire—proves that utilities can get in on the game. (Ragan also provided consulting or training for these companies.) JLL, a professional services and investment management company, shows how companies needn’t be constricted by a limited definition of what interests their clientele. The latest issue reports on the surge in skyscraper hotels and how India is making cites safe for women. The site earned coverage in The Wall Street Journal. Universities are getting in on the act, too. Metropolitan State University Denver has a new brand journalism site that tells about teaming up with the IRS’ Criminal Investigative Unit (also a Ragan client). An international consortium of universities offers scientific research in a journalism format at Futurity, where you can find out what mice and rats can teach us about anorexia.

Paz Israel Primera, 35, has been charged with three first-degree felony counts of criminal sexual penetration (involving a child under 13) and three third-degree felony charges of bribery or intimidation of a witness. Primera is scheduled to appear for his preliminary examination Wednesday morning before Chaves County Magistrate Judge K.C. Rogers. Primera was arrested by the Roswell Police Department on May 12. He had his initial arraignment on May 15, when he was ordered not to contact the purported victim. According to court records, Primera committed the offenses between April and May in Roswell, while living with the victim’s mother and her three children. Roswell police said the 10-year-old girl reported the rapes to her aunt. The aunt said the girl came running out of her home crying, saying her mother’s boyfriend had raped her, later adding she had been raped by Primera on two prior occasions in recent weeks. The girl turned 11 years old the day after the third alleged rape, court records state. The girl said Primera always carries a gun in his pants, and he had threatened to kill her family if she told anyone. The girl’s aunt said she called her sister, the mother of the girl, and said she needed to talk with her. The victim said her mother called Primera and told him to stay away from her daughter or she would call police. Police said the Children’s Advocacy Center conducted a forensic interview with the victim on May 10, the day of her 11th birthday. The girl said she wanted Primera out of her house because he is mean. “He did something to me,” the girl reportedly told police. “He raped me.” During the most recent alleged rape, the girl said Primera grabbed her by the arm, took her into her bedroom, pushed her on the bed and told her to stay put. The girl said her mother was at Wal-Mart at the time buying a present for her 11th birthday. The girl reportedly told police she declined to comply with Primera’s demands and he threatened to kill her family. The girl said she became so scared that she complied, and that Primera’s genitals had touched her genital area. The girl said Primera ceased the alleged sexual assault when her aunt pulled into the driveway of her home. “(The girl) did not know what Israel was doing, but she told him ‘no’ and to stop,” states a criminal complaint. “(She) said that this happened three times (most recently on May 9). “(The girl) said that Israel told her that if she told anyone, that he would kill all of her family.” The girl told police Primera had raped her on two prior occasions when everyone was sleeping at her home, court records state. Police said the girl told her mother about the alleged sexual assaults after the third rape. Primera is being held at the Chaves County Adult Detention Center on a $100,000 cash-only bond. He is being represented by the Public Defender’s Office, court records state.

After spending their first eight months on the ranches of Gildardo Lopez Hinojosa, the calves are about to cross the border " bound for Texas and U.S. feed lots beyond. On one of the three bridges connecting Reynosa with Texas, they might cross paths with the beef and chicken shipments that Lopez imports from the U.S. for his local chains of butcher shops and fried chicken restaurants. He gets the best price for his calves in the U.S. and it's cheaper for him to import U.S. chicken than ship Mexican chicken from the country's interior. Lopez has been selling calves and buying beef across the border for about as long as the North American Free Trade Agreement has been in effect. President Donald Trump has said the agreement that is the basis for much of the $500 billion annual trade between the U.S. and Mexico needs to be renegotiated or scrapped entirely. To hear him tell it, NAFTA was "a catastrophic trade deal for the United States." The reality is far more complicated, especially at the border where communities are enmeshed in a shared economy that can be affected by actions or words in either country. "It's a lie to say that NAFTA didn't work," said Rafael Garduno Rivera, an economist at the Center for Economic Research and Teaching in Aguascalientes, who studies the agreement's impacts. "It worked and worked very well and for both sides in various areas. Like everything there were losers and winners." Maquiladoras, as Mexican assembly plants are known, get most of the attention. They churn out everything from flat-screen televisions and washing machines to auto components that might cross borders a dozen times before a car comes off the assembly line in Michigan. But U.S. border retailers " downtown discount stores and high-end outlet shopping and malls " also depend on Mexican shoppers, especially those whose jobs in Mexican border cities allow them to shop in the U.S. For nearly 25 years, Lopez has been sending cows to the U.S. and importing beef to Mexico. Three days a week he loads four to six trailers with his young cows and sends them across the bridge connecting to Pharr, Texas. Once cleared by USDA veterinarians there, buyers from elsewhere in Texas, Arizona or even up toward the Canadian border pick up their cows. After that initial sale, Lopez does not know where they go. Continued below.

He buys from the big beef processors like IBP, National Beef and Supreme Beef, wherever he finds the best price. Lopez's calves create jobs in U.S. feed lots and slaughterhouses and the cheaper U.S. chicken he buys allows him to employ more Mexicans in his restaurants. Among his various businesses he employs about 400 people. Nearly 5 million U.S. jobs depend on trade between the two countries, according to a study released last fall by the non-partisan Washington, D.C.-based Wilson Center Mexico Institute. "The United States depends on Mexico as much as Mexico depends on the United States," Lopez said. Monica Weisberg-Stewart, across the border in McAllen, Texas, knows that as well as anyone. Her family ran discount stores on the border for more than 60 years, before making the business decision a couple years ago to close. Now Weisberg-Stewart leases their properties to other businesses. The border economy is so interconnected that moves in either country can have dire consequences. As an example, she recalled when the U.S. began requiring a new, more expensive visa for Mexicans who crossed to U.S. border cities. "It wiped out a socio-economic group that would come over here on a daily basis for groceries, milk, products, just their daily goods," she said. "Mexico not coming, Mexico not shopping, affects us." Border residents on both sides say that is already happening. A weaker Mexican peso has been a principal factor, but the unwelcoming rhetoric and fear of the sort of reception they will receive has been another. Several hundred miles upriver from Reynosa, Lidia Gonzalez sat in the shade of El Porvenir, Mexico's town square selling used clothing purchased in El Paso. "It's all second hand because people can't buy new," Gonzalez said. "It's OK for us, because from that we eat." But she was anxious because her supplier had cut back her buying trips recently. She said Mexican customs officials suddenly began hassling the buyer about her purchases, something Gonzalez attributed to the generally deteriorating relations between the two countries. Gonzalez has a visa that allows her to cross, but the last time she felt U.S. immigration agents were interrogating her more than usual. For now she has stopped crossing out of fear they might take her visa. Just west of El Paso, Marisela Sandoval, 39, of Sunland Park, New Mexico, said she had seen fewer border crossers like Gonzalez at her job at a Wal-Mart. Sandoval said Mexican shoppers were fewer and consequently sales this year in the store where she works had been way off. "Because of the dollar and the feelings about Trump, what he was saying," Sandoval explained. "People were getting afraid because in the bridge they were making them sign a paper that would say that they would take their visa and they were afraid to even come." The weaker Mexican peso put an end to Gilberto Lozoya's shopping trips to Laredo, Texas. Lozoya, 24, has spent four years working in maquiladoras in Nuevo Laredo, a major trade thoroughfare to the United States. He now works as an engineer supporting assembly lines producing gas valves, thermostats and other products so they keep running, but he's ambitious and hopes to advance. At night he studies English, because it would help him move up the ladder at so many foreign-owned maquiladoras, including the Illinois-headquartered engineering and manufacturing firm Robertshaw, where he works now. He used to cross to Laredo to buy school supplies that he couldn't find. But the strong dollar put such purchases out of reach. Many maquila workers making only $50 to $60 for a six-day work week rely on a few hours of daily overtime to make ends meet, he said. If something happened to the maquila jobs, Lozoya said he worries the unemployed would fill the ranks of the drug cartel that controls Nuevo Laredo. But nothing is clear at the moment, he said. "So far we don't know what situation we're in and what this new president (Trump) is going to say that could affect us."

It did not work at the federal level when President Reagan tried it in the 1980s. Eventually, President Reagan came to his senses and adopted a series of tax increases that helped reduce the federal deficit without doing any harm to the economy. In the 2010s, Kansas gave supply-side economics a try at the state level. The result is a wrecked state economy, a destroyed safety net and a broke treasury. The Texas Legislature used to know better. The Legislature has proposed cutting expenditures, reallocating revenues and accounting sleights that would make an Enron accountant proud in the face of lower oil revenues. But when given the opportunity to institute tax reform, the Texas Legislature instead opened the door to even higher property taxes that benefit the rich at the expense of the middle class and working poor, and will not lead to more economic growth locally. That ridiculous fiscal policy is not a path to re-election in this state. Translator To read this article in one of Houston's most-spoken languages, click on the button below. Editorials Help fight crime Hirs: Trump 'trickle-down' tax plan would be a failure for Texas Krugman: The American worker isn't so 'free' anymore Tuesday letters: Texting, Washington politics, revenue cap Needless deaths A better attempt at a supply-side plan would be one that provides tax breaks to the middle class. Call it "trickle up" economics, if you like. What Trump and the billionaires' club he heads don't want to acknowledge is that for billionaires to succeed in the long term they must have a middle class to buy their products. Henry Ford understood this perfectly more than 100 years ago. He made sure that he paid his workers enough money so they could afford the cars they were making. Economists of all stripes agree the national unemployment rate is now about as low as it can go while wage growth is stagnant and GDP growth languishes. The world has changed in significant ways that contribute to the current state of affairs. Underemployment (largely due to the Great Recession of 2008), not unemployment, is now the most significant drag on wage growth. A lack of price increases mutes demands for higher paychecks and results in employers being unable to provide such increases. For this we can thank in large part the price transparency provided by the internet, which has made comparison shopping as easy as using one's smartphone. The elephant in that room is Amazon, whose mission is to keep prices at a bare minimum, making only a minimal profit while it swallows up the entire consumer economy - and jobs - one industry at a time. Texas, where a higher than average percentage of goods are imported, would be hit even harder than other states. President Trump proposes a tariff on all import transactions and the elimination of taxes on exports. This, too, would benefit billionaires, at the expense of the middle class and the poor who shop at Wal-Mart, where most of the goods are inexpensive and imported. American exporters (think multi-national corporations) would get a windfall that would benefit principally their executives and stockholders, not their workers. Trump's tax plan is an ill-disguised attempt for the billionaire class to steal from the rest of the country. It is not surprising that those on the left and many centrists oppose the plan. They are even joined by arch-conservatives such as the Koch brothers, who are funding numerous organizations to oppose the plan. Thankfully for the country, a coalition this broad will make it extremely difficult for Trump's plan to make it into law. If it does, the U.S. will join the ranks of such countries as Argentina, Brazil, Mexico and Russia, where ruling elites live like kings while the rest suffer for their sins.

Sharon Hickson, 50, and her daughter, Courtney Rosas, 25, are accused of tampering with the IDs so they could continue to return possibly stolen items for cash. The alleged scheme was uncovered Sunday, when Montgomery County Precinct 4 Deputy Constable Jesse Bullinger pulled over Rosas for minor traffic violations. Her mother was sitting in the passenger seat. Deputy Bullinger asked for the pair's licenses, and then things began getting odd. "While we're talking to them, they seemed kind of nervous, trying to figure out what's going on," said Bullinger, adding the pair gave them IDs, not driver's licenses. "So I run the ID numbers and they come back different names than what I had." Bullinger soon realized the IDs had been altered. "They changed a 3 to an 8, they did a good job, you could barely tell. You had to really look at it," he said. After Bullinger and his partner got permission to search the car, they found piles of receipts and a detailed notebook. The receipts were from Walmart, Ross, Home Depot and other big box stores. The pair was arrested and charged with tampering with the IDs. However, any charge of theft will take additional investigating. Mother and daughter had already bonded out when Eyewitness News went looking for them. We found the pair inside their small trailer home in New Caney, just a short distance away from where most of the Porter Walmart location in many of the receipts. "Did you guys get arrested for changing your IDs and stealing?" Eyewitness News asked. "No," was the resounding answer from Hickson, who added, "I don't know who it was, but it wasn't us." Deputies, however, say they believe the two had a scheme of using old receipts from big box stores to make returns on stuff they never bought. "People get receipts that people see in the parking lot or whatever, they go in, they will go in steal those items and then try to return them using that receipt," said Bullinger.

Facebook Google Investing Analyst Upgrades Bankruptcy Buffett Corporate Governance Corporate Performance Dividends and Buybacks Earnings ETFs and Mutual Funds International Markets IPOs and Secondaries Mergers and Acquisitions Personal Finance Rumors Value Investing Economy Energy Government Regulation Healthcare Housing Jobs Special Report Brands and Products Cities Countries States Why One Analyst Is Saying to Sell Best Buy Ahead of Earnings By Chris Lange May 22, 2017 12:35 pm EDT Print Email Tweet Best Buy Co. Inc. (NYSE: BBY) is set to report its fiscal first-quarter financial results later this week, but will the retailer hurdle the bar? One key analyst thinks that these earnings will come up short. Wedbush maintained its Underperform rating and its $29 price target on the shares, implying downside of 43.5% from the previous closing price of $51.33. The firm believes that cost cuts and share repurchases have masked continuing revenue declines. Wedbush expects comp declines to persist due to a lack of compelling new products while the possibility of heightened competition is a constant threat to gross margin. With declining revenues and fewer cost cuts going forward, Best Buy has few levers other than buybacks to drive EPS growth in the 2018 fiscal year. Looking at the results, Wedbush expects revenues to hit $8.30 billion and earnings per share (EPS) to come in at $0.40, compared with Best Buy’s first-quarter guidance for revenues between $8.2 billion to $8.3 billion and EPS in the range of $0.35 to $0.40. Wedbush also expects domestic comps to be down 1.5%, versus guidance of −2.5% to −1.5%, as in-store traffic declines overshadow gains in online shopping and a slight tailwind from HHGregg’s bankruptcy. The firm expects international comps up 2.0%, compared with guidance of flat to up 3.0%, driven by store closures. The firm detailed in its report: We expect negative comps for the balance of the year, attributable primarily to declining pricing for virtually every revenue category, with consumer electronics particularly challenged. We also expect continuing store traffic declines, as online competition marches inexorably forward, with Amazon and Walmart increasingly competitive and capturing share. We expect price competition to intensify around Black Friday, and through year-end we expect greater online competition than the prior year. In terms of the consensus from analysts, Thomson Reuters has estimates of $0.40 in EPS and $8.27 billion in revenue. The same period of last year reportedly had EPS of $0.44 and $8.44 billion in revenue. Shares of Best Buy were last seen up 0.4% at $51.54 on Monday, with a consensus analyst price target of $48.10 and a 52-week trading range of $28.76 to $52.67.

See Offers Business Posted Yesterday at 7:07 PM Updated May 22 increase font size Retail survey can help businesses find customers Are shoppers in red states different from those in blue states? In some ways they're much the same. By Gene MarksThe Washington Post Share Comment Read Article Your business, like many businesses, has customers all across the country thanks to the internet. Your job is to find more of them and target your products to the demographics that are most inclined to buy. The problem is that you have limited marketing resources and don’t want to waste money by targeting the wrong group. Should politics be a factor? You would think that the Trump supporter in Texas would share little in common with the Hillary fan from Chicago. A new survey may help you figure this out. According to an infographic released Monday by Goodshop, an online marketplace that donates a portion of every sale to more than 114,000 nonprofits and schools, your potential customers in red and blue states are different in some ways, the same in others. For example, red state people seem to shop travel sites more than their blue state counterparts and favor brands like Tripadvisor, Hotels.com and Orbitz. So if you’re selling travel-related products or services you may find more customers there. Not surprisingly, people in red states consider themselves more independent (doesn’t Texas want to secede?) and want less help not only from the government, but, apparently, from contractors too. They prefer do-it-yourself projects and like arts and crafts stores as well as the big brand hardware outlets like Home Depot and Lowe’s more so than those in blue states. Again, if that’s the kind of product or service you provide . . . well, now you know where to sell. Regardless of these differences, there’s one thing that both Republicans and Democrats can agree on: value. Kohl’s, Wal-Mart, Target and Amazon were the favorite brand names in both red and blue states. These are all brands that provide affordable products for daily use and emphasize convenience over specialization. Apparently, there are a lot of 99 percenters out there, regardless of their political affiliation. Share Read or Post Comments Were you interviewed for this story?

An analysis has found up to 7.5 million jobs that deal with merchandise are set to be automated over the next decade.

Scroll down for video  An analysis has found up to 7.5 million jobs that deal with merchandise are set to be automated over the next decade– leaving behind a large portion of 'stranded workers'. Those who work as cashiers have the highest risk of being replaced, and 73% of the positions are held by women The study was released by Cornerstone Capital Group that found there are some 16 million American working in retail, 'which represents 10 percent of the nation's working population and generates 6 percent of U.S. gross domestic product (GDP),' reads a press release. 'This in-depth examination of retail automation gives investors insights as they consider investment risks and opportunities,' said Jon Lukomnik, IRRCi executive director.

'The shrinking of retail jobs in many ways threatens to mirror the decline in manufacturing in the U.S.' TECHNOLOGIES SET TO TAKEOVER RETAIL JOBS Mobile devices: Mobile apps enable consumers to scan a barcode or take a picture of a product to access product info or find other colors and sizes on the retailer’s ecommerce site Self-checkout: Customers scan and finalize purchase at terminal Digital kiosks: Touch screens that enable consumers to view product info, access customer reviews, and place orders for delivery Proximity beacons: Devices that alert shoppers to promotions or provide sales associates with information on frequent store visitors to deliver high-touch service Workforce and task management solutions: Software that analyzes, forecasts, and manages labor scheduling and task management RFID technology: Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags enable enhanced inventory tracking throughout the supply chain Autonomous robots: Smart robots that aid in areas ranging from leading customers to desired products to inventory replenishment Smart price tags: Smart price tags can be changed in real time based on demand or other trends  Sensor-based checkout: Contactless checkout by automatic scanning of product as customer walks out of store Smart shelves: Sensor-based shelves that detect when inventory is low 'Moreover, in this case, workers at risk are already disproportionately working poor, so any disruption may cause strains in the social safety net and stresses on local tax revenues.' The businesses are going to use robots for checking customers out, returning items to wracks and even cleaning up the store. But the study found that they are still not advanced enough to takeover positions that require more interaction with the customers. Robots will be used in sales positions, as they can easily find what items in the story people need. Lowe's has been using robots (pictured) for a few years that let people find any item just by letting the machine 'see it'  Many major players, such as Macy's, J.C. Penney and Wal-Mart, have shut down numerous establishments in order to make up for the lost revenue, as retail has been on the decline for the past few years. 'These headwinds are pushing retailers to rethink the traditional retail business model,' reads the report. 'Retailers are investing in technology to build out their omnichannel platforms. In some cases, technology is complementing labor by providing a better customer experience.' For this analysis, the team examined 30 retail companies and ten in-store technologies that will impact the industry, and take human jobs, were identified while investigating the businesses. This included digital kiosks, proximity beacons and smart prices tags. AMAZON'S WAREHOUSE ROBOTS  The squat orange robots use technology acquired when the company bought robot-maker Kiva Systems in 2012. They navigate by scanning coded stickers on the floor, following digital commands that are beamed wirelessly from a central computer. Each of the orange machines can slide under and then lift a stack of shelves that's four feet (1.2 meters) wide and holds up to 750 lbs (340kg) of merchandise. The system uses bar codes to track which items are on each shelf, so a robot can fetch the right shelves for each worker as orders come in. Because the robots travel underneath, the shelves can be stacked closely together, which means the warehouse can hold more goods.  And because mobile technology is here to stay, many of the sale jobs will be gone because consumers can just look up what they need in the palm of their hand – instead of flagging down an employee. For example, proximity beacons use the consumer's mobile phone location to alert them about personalized promotions. Another technology listed in the analysis known as 'Just Walk Out', automatically identifies products taken or returned to shelves and keeps track of them in a virtual cart. In some cases, technology is complementing labor by freeing workers from mundane tasks and facilitating a more personalized customer experience. In some cases, technology is complementing labor by freeing workers from mundane tasks and facilitating a more personalized customer experience. But in other cases, stores could use smart robots like Pepper, pictured, to assist customers   But the study found that in many others, technology has the potential to automate a significant part of the sales process and render a range of jobs redundant. Taken together, store closures and technology have the potential to dramatically alter the employment landscape in America. 'The retail landscape is changing rapidly and investors need to understand the social and governance issues impacting valuations for public companies in this sector,' said Erika Karp, Cornerstone founder and chief executive officer.

Play it now! more GADGET REVIEWS Is this the ultimate party speaker? MailOnline puts Sony's XB40 to the test Sony SRS-XB40 has a built-in multi-coloured line light, speaker lights and a flashing strobe. It features 24 hours of battery life and claims to be a 'mini-disco on the move'. But does it live up to the claim? Samsung's Galaxy S8: A hefty price tag and a dumb personal assistant Samsung's new Galaxy S8 phone is stunning, but its $100 price hike is hard to swallow. Overall the S8 is for those who want elegance - and are willing to pay for it. Affordable, robust and surprisingly responsive: Samsung's Galaxy A5 With the eagerly awaited Galaxy S8 having been pushed back, South Korea-based Samsung has plugged the gap with the Samsung Galaxy A5, a high-end device with a mid-range price tag. Is it really worth paying £280 for Nintendo's Switch? MailOnline's verdict While the design is impressive and easy to use, the game line up is disappointing. Google's Daydream: The $79 headset that could bring VR to the masses Google's $79 headset is superb in terms of hardware - but is currently let down by a lack of apps. However, it has absolutely huge potential to finally bring VR to the masses. Welcome Home: Google's $130 smart speaker Google's smart Home speaker still has a lot of learning to do, and loses out to Amazon's Echo in some areas - but has incredible potential 'Not quite an iPhone replacement': Google's Pixel phone Google's Pixel handset is good, and boasts an amazing camera and smart assistant. It's the king of the Android handsets - but still not great. Xbox One S review: Console that will make your 4K TV shine Microsoft's Xbox One S has shrunk the giant console by 40%, and is stunningly designed console with 4K HDR capabilities - but comes with some caveats. The $1,000 wireless speaker that really IS worth the price: Naim Mu-so Qb review Naim's incredible Mu-So Qb takes you back to the good old days - where the music captivates and enthralls, rather that simply being something in the background. The hi-tech $2,000 spin bike that really could change your life Peloton's hi-tech bike lets you stream live and on demand rides to your home - and it's one of the best examples of fitness technology out there - at a price.

With respect to capital markets, using blockchain to improve dispute resolution and settlement times can deliver benefits across boundaries. Krishna noted that an estimated $300 billion in underlying costs of global commerce can be optimized with blockchain, a powerful statement of the technology’s benefit to industries such as shipping, property and capital markets. Blockchain will do for transactions what the Internet did for information. Krishna provided recommendations for organizations ready to adopt the technology. First, blockchain must be built in the open. Open source methods are aimed at providing the transparency, interoperability and support required to bring emerging technologies into mainstream adoption. He identified Hyperledger, the open source collaborative effort created to advance cross-industry blockchain technologies hosted by the Linux Foundation, as the best path forward to achieve strength and technical stability. Hyperledger Fabric, a blockchain framework based on open standards to which IBM is an early contributor, demonstrates powerful properties for cross-industry use. It supports partitioned execution, permissioned membership and channels to enhance confidentiality, as well as transaction history and network tools to strengthen production workloads. Secondly, it is critical to leverage permissions and identity so there are no anonymous participants in a blockchain network and data is consistent and protected — a critical point for both enterprises and regulators alike. Finally, blockchains must be built in a robust technology environment that enables organizations to remain competitive in global markets: security, confidentiality, auditability, reliability and scalability. Krishna identified blockchain’s ability to reduce “friction in transaction systems” as the technology’s core benefit, by removing factors that slow down or interfere with the efficient transfer of goods and services. What is really going to drive blockchain’s growth is its ability to go “outside the enterprise” and drive savings across every transaction, Krishna said, adding, “making it scalable, making it easy, making it possible for a lot more people to adopt the technology is where a lot of technologies and companies flounder.” He cited three examples of work IBM is doing to advance blockchain in a range of industries: Walmart for a food safety traceability pilot, Maersk’s partnership with IBM to develop a digitized global trade platform, and DTCC’s Trade Information Warehouse service to manage record-keeping and payments in derivatives trading. The lesson of all of these examples, he stated, is blockchain’s ability to improve the physical world, achieve GDP benefits for countries and profit growth for companies. To support the rapid adoption of blockchain in the enterprise, IBM recently announced a new an expansion of the blockchain ecosystem program, the IBM Blockchain Founder Accelerator. The program is designed to address the key challenges many early adopters and enterprise developers have identified through the development of leading blockchain networks. IBM also announced the largest study to date among C-Suite executives seeking their perspective on blockchain. Conducted by IBM’s Institute for Business Value, one third of almost 3,000 executives surveyed said they are using or considering blockchain in their business. About IBM IBM is the leader in open-source blockchain solutions built for the enterprise. As an early member of Hyperledger, an open source collaborative effort created to advance cross-industry blockchain technologies, IBM is dedicated to supporting the development of openly-governed blockchains. IBM has worked with more than 400 clients across financial services, supply chains, IoT, risk management, digital rights management and healthcare to implement blockchain applications.

(source) It looks like it could be time to prep for Ebola 2.0. The WHO had already warned a new outbreak could happen at any time because the virus lurks in the eyes, central nervous system, and bodily fluids of survivors.   Dr. Peter Salama, the executive director of the WHO’s health emergencies program, told the press to “never, ever underestimate Ebola” and to “make sure we have a no-regrets approach to this outbreak.” (source) Where it’s happening The fact that this epidemic is currently in a remote part of the North East Congo should set your mind at ease, although not so much that you don’t keep on eye on the situation. With the availability of rapid air travel and unchecked immigration into Europe, these types of things can spread incredibly quickly. This map from the CDC shows the area in which the current outbreak is centered. It’s the large red splotch in the Northern part of the Congo.   It is both good and bad news that the area is extremely remote. It’s good because it lessens the possibility for exposure to other areas. Not many people travel in and out of Likati because there are no paved roads. But this also causes concern because it makes it far more difficult to monitor the area, and it’s spreading fast. The risk from the outbreak is “high at the national level,” the WHO said, because the disease was so severe and was spreading in a remote area in north-eastern Congo with “suboptimal surveillance” and limited access to health care. “Risk at the regional level is moderate due to the proximity of international borders and the recent influx of refugees from Central African Republic,” the organisation said, but it nonetheless described the global risk as low because the area is so remote. About a week ago, in addition to the nine suspected cases, 125 patients who had come into close contact with the disease were being monitored. Now about 400 patients are being followed, even as nine new cases were reported on Thursday, according to the WHO. (source) It’s spreading rapidly throughout the region, up 800% over the last week. (source) Why Ebola is so worrisome Part of the reason Ebola seems particularly terrifying is the graphic presentation, which is the stuff of horror movies. It is a hemorrhagic disease, which means that it can cause bleeding from the mouth, eyes, nose, and rectum. Here’s how it progresses: The incubation period, that is, the time interval from infection with the virus to onset of symptoms is 2 to 21 days. Humans are not infectious until they develop symptoms. First symptoms are the sudden onset of fever fatigue, muscle pain, headache and sore throat. This is followed by vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, symptoms of impaired kidney and liver function, and in some cases, both internal and external bleeding (e.g. oozing from the gums, blood in the stools). Laboratory findings include low white blood cell and platelet counts and elevated liver enzymes. (source) But it isn’t just the gruesome visuals. The risk of death from Ebola can be anywhere between 50-90%, depending on the strain. This outbreak is the Zaire strain of Ebola, which is the same one that made it to America back in 2014. The 2014 outbreak that could have spread through America If you recall, the fact that it didn’t become widespread in the US during the 2014 scare was NOT because it was handled properly.  source, and It was sheer luck. When American Patient Zero, Thomas Duncan, first showed up in a Texas emergency room, he wasn’t tested, despite the fact that he told them he was from Ebola-stricken Liberia.  Proper practices were not followed, and one of the nurses who cared for him became the second victim. All sorts of near misses occurred, like the fact that the plane that carried an Ebola patient made FIVE trips before it was sanitized. The news came out this morning that the second American nurse diagnosed with Ebola flew on a plane with 132 other passengers from Cleveland, Ohio to Dallas, Texas.  Amber Vinson had a low-grade fever when she boarded the plane, and was admitted to Texas Presbyterian Hospital just hours after disembarking. The latest horror? Not only were 132 people who flew with Vinson exposed to Ebola. In the time it took the CDC to notify Frontier Airlines of the issue, 5 more flights were made. (source) That sounds like the plot of a cringe-y movie, where you watch the sneeze spray of an infected person in slow motion landing on everyone nearby. But that wasn’t the only mind-boggling thing that happened. But that wasn’t the only mind-boggling thing that happened. We brought some exposed people back to the US and put them in hotels. A couple of days ago an American healthcare worker who had been definitively diagnosed with Ebola was brought back to the US for treatment at the National Institute of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, Maryland.  Eleven more patients have been isolated and are on their way to the United States as well, after having had  “potential exposure” to the disease. Now, about those people who were “potentially exposed”? They aren’t being hospitalized. Oh no.  They are being brought back to stay at hotels “near” three different hospitals in different regions of the country. I couldn’t make this up if I tried. (source) So, I think we can all agree, looking to the National Institute of Health, the CDC, and the WHO to keep us “safe” is not the best fall-back plan. We have to be prepared to take action ourselves should this outbreak turn into a pandemic. Don’t panic. Just Pay Attention. There is usually a little bit of warning before an outbreak becomes severe enough to warrant the title “pandemic.” It isn’t like The Walking Dead, where suddenly 80% of the population is affected overnight. With a pandemic, you hear a little hum about it before it gets bad. The World Health Organization makes some flyers, reports are given, and there is a mention on the evening news. But, generally speaking, officials are stingy with information because they don’t want to “start a panic.” This means that the judicious prepper needs to pay close attention when new viruses begin to be mentioned. Now, just because a virus is mentioned, it doesn’t mean that it’s going to become a pandemic, of course. However, it can be an early warning sign that you need to get your ducks in a row. Think of it like a tropical storm.  You hear about it gathering steam out over the ocean well before it ever makes landfall. Just because there is a storm somewhere in the Atlantic, it doesn’t mean that it’s going to hit, but it means that the wise person begins to pay closer attention to the weather reports, makes certain that the basics are stockpiled, and puts together a plan just in case the time to board up the windows arrives. How to Prep for Ebola: Worst Case Scenario Avoiding contact with people who have the illness is the only way to prevent getting it. Should an outbreak occur, isolating yourselves is the best way to stay safe and healthy. This is the tricky part: How do you know that the time has come to get the family inside and lock the doors behind you? Lizzie Bennett, a retired medical professional, wrote an incredibly helpful article over on her website Underground Medic during the initial outbreak. Bennett recommends social distancing as the only effective way to protect yourself and your family from an outbreak of disease. How long you should remain isolated depends primarily on where you live. For those in towns and cities it will be for much longer than those living in rural retreats where human contact is minimal. Though those fortunate enough to live in such surroundings should remember that if the situation is dire enough, people will leave the cities looking for safety in less populated areas. In large centres of population there will be more people moving around, legally or otherwise, each of these individuals represents a possible uptick in the disease rates, allowing the spread to continue longer than it would have they stayed indoors and/or out of circulation. Even when the initial phase is on the wane, or has passed through an area, people travelling into that area can bring it back with them triggering a second wave of disease as people are now emerging from their isolation… … One hundred miles is my buffer zone for disease, of course it could already be in my city, but practicalities dictate that I will not stay away from people because hundreds in Europe are dropping like flies. Maps of disease spread look like a locust swarm moving across the country and this allows disease spread to be tracked on an hour by hour basis. One of the few instances where mainstream media will be useful. (source) Once you’ve gone into lockdown, how long you must stay there is dependent on the spread of the illness. Times will vary.  Bennett suggests these guidelines: Once the doors were locked we would stay there for at least two weeks after the last case within 100 miles is reported. A government all clear would be weighed against how long it had been since the last case was reported in the area I have designated as my buffer zone. There is of course still the chance that someone from outside the area will bring the disease in with them causing a second wave of illness. You cannot seal off cities to prevent this. Going out after self-imposed isolation should be kept to a minimum for as long as possible, and if you don’t have to, then don’t do it. Far better to let those that are comfortable being out and about get on with it and see if any new cases emerge before exposing yourself and your family to that possibility. (source) What does it mean to go into lockdown? This Ebola thing could go bad in a hurry. And by bad I mean that the last time around, it killed well over half of the people who contracted it in West Africa. If the situation hits close enough to home that you decide to go it’s time to isolate yourselves, the rules to this are intractable. No one goes out. No one comes in. I know this sounds harsh, but there are to be no exceptions. If you make exceptions, you might as well go wrestle with runny-nosed strangers at the local Wal-Mart and then come home and hug your children, because it’s the same thing. Once you have gone into lockdown mode, that means that the supplies you have on hand are the supplies you have to see you through.  You can’t run out to the store and get something you’ve forgotten. That means if a family member shows up, they have to go into quarantine for at least 4 weeks, during which time they are not allowed access to the home or family, nor are they allowed to go out in public.  Set up an area on your property that is far from your home for them to hang out for their month of quarantine. If at the end of the month they are presenting no symptoms, then they can come in. It sadly means that you may be forced to turn someone away if they are ill, because to help them means to risk your family. Now is the time to plan with your preparedness group how you intend to handle the situation. Will you shelter together, in the same location, and reserve a secondary location to retreat to if the situation worsens further or if someone becomes ill? Will you shelter separately because of the nature of the emergency?  Decide together on what event and proximity will trigger you to go into lockdown mode. Make your plan and stick to it, regardless of pressure from those who think you are over-reacting, the schools that your children have stopped attending, and any other external influences. If you’ve decided that there is a great enough risk that you need to go into lockdown, you must adhere to your plan. Prepare an isolation area. In the event that a member of your group becomes ill, they need to immediately be quarantined from the rest of the group. By the time they’re showing symptoms, it could be too late to prevent the spread of illness but effort should still be taken to isolate them. Here are some tips on isolating a patient. The sick room should be sealed off from the rest of the house.  Use a heavy tarp over the doorway to the room on the inside and the outside. This will make a small breezeway for the caretaker to go in and out. The caretaker should cover up with disposable clothing, gloves, shoe covers, and hair covers. The caretaker should wear an N95 mask. The sick person should use disposable dishes and cutlery.  All garbage from the sick room should be placed in a heavy garbage bag and burned outdoors immediately. The sick person should not leave the room.  If there is not a bedroom with a connected bathroom, a bathroom setup should be created within the room.  Great care must be taken with the disposal of this waste. You can learn more about preparing a sick room HERE. Do you have the supplies you need to weather a pandemic? It’s time to do a last minute check of your preps because by the time a general quarantine is announced in your area or you hear the mainstream suggesting that people should stay home, it will be too late to get the rest of your supplies. As well, at that point, the path of the pandemic will have progressed so much it will be unsafe to do so. You need to be prepared to go into family lockdown mode for a minimum of 6 weeks should things get bad in your area, and preferably longer than that in the event that this takes a long time to contain.  It’s most likely that services such as public water and electricity will remain intact, but you should prepare as though they won’t be, just in case. Here’s a quick checklist along with some links to resources.  Base amounts on the number of family members you’ll be sheltering. Drinking water (1 gallon per person per day) Food (including items that don’t require fuel for preparation) Heavy duty garbage bags Sanitation supplies such as toilet paper, paper towels, baby wipes, and feminine hygiene supplies) Entertainment – you’ll want to be able to keep children and restless family members  busy so get craft supplies, books, games, and puzzles Basic medical supplies (here’s a list) Pandemic kits that contain protective clothing (we have a Pandemic Flu Kit for each family member) Extra N100 masks – N95 are better than nothing at all, but not sufficient) Nitrile gloves – be sure to order appropriate si Safety goggles with an elastic band to ensure a snug fit Antibacterial cleaners such as disposable wipes, bleach, and spray cleaners Antibacterial hand sanitizer (12 pack of Purell Pump Bottle) Bleach for cleaning Note – we do not commonly use anti-bacterial products but in a situation like this, it’s important to have this type of thing on hand in the event that there are issues with sanitation.

(AP Photo/Christopher Sherman) Posted: Monday, May 22, 2017 9:21 am Complex world of border trade: Cattle go north, meat south Associated Press | 0 comments REYNOSA, Mexico (AP) — Waving arms and brandishing a long electric prod, the ranch hands and truck drivers herd about 400 leggy calves onto trucks as the sun crests on the outskirts of this border city. After spending their first eight months on the ranches of Gildardo Lopez Hinojosa, the calves are about to cross the border — bound for Texas and U.S. feed lots beyond. On one of the three bridges connecting Reynosa with Texas, they might cross paths with the beef and chicken shipments that Lopez imports from the U.S. for his local chains of butcher shops and fried chicken restaurants. He gets the best price for his calves in the U.S. and it's cheaper for him to import U.S. chicken than ship Mexican chicken from the country's interior. Lopez has been selling calves and buying beef across the border for about as long as the North American Free Trade Agreement has been in effect. President Donald Trump has said the agreement that is the basis for much of the $500 billion annual trade between the U.S. and Mexico needs to be renegotiated or scrapped entirely. To hear him tell it, NAFTA was "a catastrophic trade deal for the United States." The reality is far more complicated, especially at the border where communities are enmeshed in a shared economy that can be affected by actions or words in either country. "It's a lie to say that NAFTA didn't work," said Rafael Garduno Rivera, an economist at the Center for Economic Research and Teaching in Aguascalientes, who studies the agreement's impacts. "It worked and worked very well and for both sides in various areas. Like everything there were losers and winners." Maquiladoras, as Mexican assembly plants are known, get most of the attention. They churn out everything from flat-screen televisions and washing machines to auto components that might cross borders a dozen times before a car comes off the assembly line in Michigan. But U.S. border retailers — downtown discount stores and high-end outlet shopping and malls — also depend on Mexican shoppers, especially those whose jobs in Mexican border cities allow them to shop in the U.S. For nearly 25 years, Lopez has been sending cows to the U.S. and importing beef to Mexico. Three days a week he loads four to six trailers with his young cows and sends them across the bridge connecting to Pharr, Texas. Once cleared by USDA veterinarians there, buyers from elsewhere in Texas, Arizona or even up toward the Canadian border pick up their cows. After that initial sale, Lopez does not know where they go. In theory, some could come back to him mixed in among the 25 tons of beef he imports from the U.S. every week for his butcher shops. He buys from the big beef processors like IBP, National Beef and Supreme Beef, wherever he finds the best price. Lopez's calves create jobs in U.S. feed lots and slaughterhouses and the cheaper U.S. chicken he buys allows him to employ more Mexicans in his restaurants. Among his various businesses he employs about 400 people. Nearly 5 million U.S. jobs depend on trade between the two countries, according to a study released last fall by the non-partisan Washington, D.C.-based Wilson Center Mexico Institute. "The United States depends on Mexico as much as Mexico depends on the United States," Lopez said. Monica Weisberg-Stewart, across the border in McAllen, Texas, knows that as well as anyone. Her family ran discount stores on the border for more than 60 years, before making the business decision a couple years ago to close. Now Weisberg-Stewart leases their properties to other businesses. The border economy is so interconnected that moves in either country can have dire consequences. As an example, she recalled when the U.S. began requiring a new, more expensive visa for Mexicans who crossed to U.S. border cities. "It wiped out a socio-economic group that would come over here on a daily basis for groceries, milk, products, just their daily goods," she said. "Mexico not coming, Mexico not shopping, affects us." Border residents on both sides say that is already happening. A weaker Mexican peso has been a principal factor, but the unwelcoming rhetoric and fear of the sort of reception they will receive has been another. Several hundred miles upriver from Reynosa, Lidia Gonzalez sat in the shade of El Porvenir, Mexico's town square selling used clothing purchased in El Paso. "It's all second hand because people can't buy new," Gonzalez said. "It's OK for us, because from that we eat." But she was anxious because her supplier had cut back her buying trips recently. She said Mexican customs officials suddenly began hassling the buyer about her purchases, something Gonzalez attributed to the generally deteriorating relations between the two countries. Gonzalez has a visa that allows her to cross, but the last time she felt U.S. immigration agents were interrogating her more than usual. For now she has stopped crossing out of fear they might take her visa. Just west of El Paso, Marisela Sandoval, 39, of Sunland Park, New Mexico, said she had seen fewer border crossers like Gonzalez at her job at a Wal-Mart. Sandoval said Mexican shoppers were fewer and consequently sales this year in the store where she works had been way off. "Because of the dollar and the feelings about Trump, what he was saying," Sandoval explained. "People were getting afraid because in the bridge they were making them sign a paper that would say that they would take their visa and they were afraid to even come." The weaker Mexican peso put an end to Gilberto Lozoya's shopping trips to Laredo, Texas. Lozoya, 24, has spent four years working in maquiladoras in Nuevo Laredo, a major trade thoroughfare to the United States. He now works as an engineer supporting assembly lines producing gas valves, thermostats and other products so they keep running, but he's ambitious and hopes to advance. At night he studies English, because it would help him move up the ladder at so many foreign-owned maquiladoras, including the Illinois-headquartered engineering and manufacturing firm Robertshaw, where he works now. He used to cross to Laredo to buy school supplies that he couldn't find. But the strong dollar put such purchases out of reach. Many maquila workers making only $50 to $60 for a six-day work week rely on a few hours of daily overtime to make ends meet, he said. If something happened to the maquila jobs, Lozoya said he worries the unemployed would fill the ranks of the drug cartel that controls Nuevo Laredo. But nothing is clear at the moment, he said. "So far we don't know what situation we're in and what this new president (Trump) is going to say that could affect us." Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The shooting occurred about 4:50 a.m. in the 3900 block of Pennsylvania Avenue SE, along a stretch of homes and businesses near Alabama Avenue. Police identified the victim as Antonio Bassett, 35, of Southeast. He was pronounced dead at the scene. — Peter Hermann Police: No sex assault at Holocaust Museum A report of an alleged sexual assault at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum that had the popular tourist site on an hour-long lockdown Sunday was false, authorities said. U.S. Park Police found no evidence that an assault had occurred, said Sgt. Anna Rose, an agency spokeswoman. Police said they received a call about 3:20 p.m. Sunday regarding an alleged sexual assault in a restroom. Officials placed the museum on a lockdown. Rose said authorities got a description of the alleged suspect, reviewed video footage and found that “there was no evidence and no witnesses to corroborate the story.” — Dana Hedgpeth Jail inmate who died was awaiting trial A D.C. jail inmate who was found dead in his cell Thursday was awaiting trial in the near-fatal shooting of a 9-year-old boy in Northeast Washington in 2014, according to authorities and police and court records. Kenneth Parker, 28, had been charged with assault with intent to kill and other offenses in the Oct. 3, 2014, shooting of Jaydan Stancil, who was caught in crossfire outside his Mayfair Mansions apartment complex. Jaydan befriended then-D.C. Police Chief Cathy L. Lanier and was there when three police officers who saved his life were awarded medals during a ceremony. He had been shot in the head and suffered severe brain damage. Parker was arrested in March 2016, the first break police had in the case. Other people are still being sought. Parker’s attorney did not return calls seeking comment. D.C. police and jail officials are investigating the death and said Parker had been in the general population at the jail. After discovering Parker, officers attempted to revive him before emergency workers took him to George Washington University Hospital. He was later pronounced dead. Officials did not release a cause or manner of death. Parker had been scheduled for trial in October. VIRGINIA Police say man fled ‘upskirting’ incident A man fled a Walmart store in the Fairfax area after being accused of trying to record images under the dresses of a 10-year-old girl and her mother, police said. The “upskirting” incident happened about 11 a.m. May 14 at the store on Burke Commons Road in Burke. Police said the man used a recording device to “unlawfully record up the dresses of a 10-year-old girl and a 36-year-old woman.” When the child’s mother confronted the man, he left the store before law enforcement arrived. He fled the parking lot in a silver or gray Honda Crosstour or similar vehicle. The man was wearing a black hat with an Adidas logo, black pants, a black, polo-style shirt and dark shoes at the time of the incident. He is white, about 40 years old, about 6 feet tall and weighs roughly 175 pounds. Anyone with information is asked to call 571-641-7779. — Dana Hedgpeth local Orlando Shooting Updates News and analysis on the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. post_newsletter348 follow-orlando false after3th false Please provide a valid email address.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 22 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Consensus 2017: From Capital Markets to Supply Chains, IBM Outlines How Blockchain Will Reimagine Business Networks Armonk, NY and New York City – 22 May 2017: Today at CoinDesk Consensus, the world’s leading blockchain conference, Arvind Krishna, senior vice president, Hybrid Cloud and director, IBM Research (NYSE: IBM), delivered a keynote presentation detailing the rapid growth in blockchain applications in industries from capital markets to supply chains. With respect to capital markets, using blockchain to improve dispute resolution and settlement times can deliver benefits across boundaries. Krishna noted that an estimated $300 billion in underlying costs of global commerce can be optimized with blockchain, a powerful statement of the technology’s benefit to industries such as shipping, property and capital markets. Blockchain will do for transactions what the Internet did for information. Krishna provided recommendations for organizations ready to adopt the technology. First, blockchain must be built in the open. Open source methods are aimed at providing the transparency, interoperability and support required to bring emerging technologies into mainstream adoption. He identified Hyperledger, the open source collaborative effort created to advance cross-industry blockchain technologies hosted by the Linux Foundation, as the best path forward to achieve strength and technical stability. Hyperledger Fabric, a blockchain framework based on open standards to which IBM is an early contributor, demonstrates powerful properties for cross-industry use. It supports partitioned execution, permissioned membership and channels to enhance confidentiality, as well as transaction history and network tools to strengthen production workloads. Secondly, it is critical to leverage permissions and identity so there are no anonymous participants in a blockchain network and data is consistent and protected — a critical point for both enterprises and regulators alike. Finally, blockchains must be built in a robust technology environment that enables organizations to remain competitive in global markets: security, confidentiality, auditability, reliability and scalability. Krishna identified blockchain’s ability to reduce “friction in transaction systems” as the technology’s core benefit, by removing factors that slow down or interfere with the efficient transfer of goods and services. What is really going to drive blockchain’s growth is its ability to go “outside the enterprise” and drive savings across every transaction, Krishna said, adding, “making it scalable, making it easy, making it possible for a lot more people to adopt the technology is where a lot of technologies and companies flounder.” He cited three examples of work IBM is doing to advance blockchain in a range of industries: Walmart for a food safety traceability pilot, Maersk’s partnership with IBM to develop a digitized global trade platform, and DTCC’s Trade Information Warehouse service to manage record-keeping and payments in derivatives trading. The lesson of all of these examples, he stated, is blockchain’s ability to improve the physical world, achieve GDP benefits for countries and profit growth for companies. To support the rapid adoption of blockchain in the enterprise, IBM recently announced a new an expansion of the blockchain ecosystem program, the IBM Blockchain Founder Accelerator. The program is designed to address the key challenges many early adopters and enterprise developers have identified through the development of leading blockchain networks. IBM also announced the largest study to date among C-Suite executives seeking their perspective on blockchain. Conducted by IBM’s Institute for Business Value, one third of almost 3,000 executives surveyed said they are using or considering blockchain in their business. About IBM IBM is the leader in open-source blockchain solutions built for the enterprise. As an early member of Hyperledger, an open source collaborative effort created to advance cross-industry blockchain technologies, IBM is dedicated to supporting the development of openly-governed blockchains. IBM has worked with more than 400 clients across financial services, supply chains, IoT, risk management, digital rights management and healthcare to implement blockchain applications.

So just what is NAFTA? (May 18) Media: Associated Press REYNOSA, Mexico (AP) — Waving arms and brandishing a long electric prod, the ranch hands and truck drivers herd about 400 leggy calves onto trucks as the sun crests on the outskirts of this border city. After spending their first eight months on the ranches of Gildardo Lopez Hinojosa, the calves are about to cross the border — bound for Texas and U.S. feed lots beyond. On one of the three bridges connecting Reynosa with Texas, they might cross paths with the beef and chicken shipments that Lopez imports from the U.S. for his local chains of butcher shops and fried chicken restaurants. He gets the best price for his calves in the U.S. and it's cheaper for him to import U.S. chicken than ship Mexican chicken from the country's interior. Lopez has been selling calves and buying beef across the border for about as long as the North American Free Trade Agreement has been in effect. President Donald Trump has said the agreement that is the basis for much of the $500 billion annual trade between the U.S. and Mexico needs to be renegotiated or scrapped entirely. To hear him tell it, NAFTA was "a catastrophic trade deal for the United States." The reality is far more complicated, especially at the border where communities are enmeshed in a shared economy that can be affected by actions or words in either country.

"It worked and worked very well and for both sides in various areas. Like everything there were losers and winners." Maquiladoras, as Mexican assembly plants are known, get most of the attention. They churn out everything from flat-screen televisions and washing machines to auto components that might cross borders a dozen times before a car comes off the assembly line in Michigan. But U.S. border retailers — downtown discount stores and high-end outlet shopping and malls — also depend on Mexican shoppers, especially those whose jobs in Mexican border cities allow them to shop in the U.S. For nearly 25 years, Lopez has been sending cows to the U.S. and importing beef to Mexico. Three days a week he loads four to six trailers with his young cows and sends them across the bridge connecting to Pharr, Texas. Once cleared by USDA veterinarians there, buyers from elsewhere in Texas, Arizona or even up toward the Canadian border pick up their cows. After that initial sale, Lopez does not know where they go. In theory, some could come back to him mixed in among the 25 tons of beef he imports from the U.S. every week for his butcher shops. He buys from the big beef processors like IBP, National Beef and Supreme Beef, wherever he finds the best price. Lopez's calves create jobs in U.S. feed lots and slaughterhouses and the cheaper U.S. chicken he buys allows him to employ more Mexicans in his restaurants. Among his various businesses he employs about 400 people. Nearly 5 million U.S. jobs depend on trade between the two countries, according to a study released last fall by the non-partisan Washington, D.C.-based Wilson Center Mexico Institute. "The United States depends on Mexico as much as Mexico depends on the United States," Lopez said. Monica Weisberg-Stewart, across the border in McAllen, Texas, knows that as well as anyone. Her family ran discount stores on the border for more than 60 years, before making the business decision a couple years ago to close. Now Weisberg-Stewart leases their properties to other businesses. The border economy is so interconnected that moves in either country can have dire consequences. As an example, she recalled when the U.S. began requiring a new, more expensive visa for Mexicans who crossed to U.S. border cities. "It wiped out a socio-economic group that would come over here on a daily basis for groceries, milk, products, just their daily goods," she said. "Mexico not coming, Mexico not shopping, affects us." Border residents on both sides say that is already happening. A weaker Mexican peso has been a principal factor, but the unwelcoming rhetoric and fear of the sort of reception they will receive has been another. Several hundred miles upriver from Reynosa, Lidia Gonzalez sat in the shade of El Porvenir, Mexico's town square selling used clothing purchased in El Paso. "It's all second hand because people can't buy new," Gonzalez said. "It's OK for us, because from that we eat." But she was anxious because her supplier had cut back her buying trips recently. She said Mexican customs officials suddenly began hassling the buyer about her purchases, something Gonzalez attributed to the generally deteriorating relations between the two countries. Gonzalez has a visa that allows her to cross, but the last time she felt U.S. immigration agents were interrogating her more than usual. For now she has stopped crossing out of fear they might take her visa. Just west of El Paso, Marisela Sandoval, 39, of Sunland Park, New Mexico, said she had seen fewer border crossers like Gonzalez at her job at a Wal-Mart. Sandoval said Mexican shoppers were fewer and consequently sales this year in the store where she works had been way off. "Because of the dollar and the feelings about Trump, what he was saying," Sandoval explained. "People were getting afraid because in the bridge they were making them sign a paper that would say that they would take their visa and they were afraid to even come." The weaker Mexican peso put an end to Gilberto Lozoya's shopping trips to Laredo, Texas. Lozoya, 24, has spent four years working in maquiladoras in Nuevo Laredo, a major trade thoroughfare to the United States. He now works as an engineer supporting assembly lines producing gas valves, thermostats and other products so they keep running, but he's ambitious and hopes to advance. At night he studies English, because it would help him move up the ladder at so many foreign-owned maquiladoras, including the Illinois-headquartered engineering and manufacturing firm Robertshaw, where he works now. He used to cross to Laredo to buy school supplies that he couldn't find. But the strong dollar put such purchases out of reach. Many maquila workers making only $50 to $60 for a six-day work week rely on a few hours of daily overtime to make ends meet, he said. If something happened to the maquila jobs, Lozoya said he worries the unemployed would fill the ranks of the drug cartel that controls Nuevo Laredo. But nothing is clear at the moment, he said. "So far we don't know what situation we're in and what this new president (Trump) is going to say that could affect us."

A truck that caught fire parked behind the Denny’s Diner on Harbison Boulevard on Monday gave the impression to drivers that the restaurant was on fire. The fire, which started shortly after 4 p.m., did not threaten any neighboring buildings, said Capt. Brick Lewis, spokesman for the Columbia Fire Department. The truck was actually about three to four buildings away from Denny’s on Saturn Parkway, Lewis said. To passerby, it could have looked like the Walmart right behind the restaurant was on fire, too, he said. Saturn Parkway is a small secondary road that connects Harbison Boulevard to Bower Parkway. It runs in between the Best Buy and Walmart on Harbison Boulevard. By 4:30 p.m., there were no visible flames coming from the truck, but it was still smouldering, Lewis said.

At first, the locally-brewed favourites like Saturday Night and Impact were only available from its Kelly Lake Road storefront and select local bars and restaurants.

But the big pension funds are not letting up and are applying newfound financial pressures to ensure they live up to those words. It is coming as Exxon Mobil Corp. is having its annual shareholder meeting at month’s end. The oil giant has already called the Paris agreement to try and keep temperature increases to no more than 2 degrees Celsius by mid Century an “effective framework.” The company, along with Royal Dutch Shell is asking the Trump administration to keep its seat at the table. “Investors who feel that climate is a risk now realize they just have themselves to manage this risk in the next few years,” Edward Kamonjoh, executive director of the 50/50 Climate Project in Washington, in a Reuters story, referring to the White House’s efforts to put carbon cuts on the back burner.  The same story goes on to say that despite the Trump administration’s positions, some companies have been making changes without the need for institutional investors and shareholders to make those demands. It points to Wespath which on May 2 withdrew its call for Chevron Corp. to accept climate change and take steps to mitigate carbon; Chevon outlined in detail its approach to do so. Natural gas, of course, has become a hot commodity and oil companies are exploring for it while they simultaneously drill for oil. Natural gas releases about half the CO2 as does coal and it is now just as abundant and just as cheap. Thus, it has become the fuel of choice for electric generators, meaning that big oil is cashing in on the trend. At the same time, natural gas liquids are used in the chemical and manufacturing processes. For their part, the institutional investors are not about to let up. They control trillions of dollars and through the pension funds they manage. Studies vary on whether shareholder activism is actually a productive way to drive change and to increase returns. One side argues that the goodwill generated by investing in cleaner energies is enduring and that it goes to the bottom line. Others, though, say that fund managers should concentrate exclusively on building shareholder value — that such a tack is the best way to serve society. In other words, profitable companies spend money throughout their supply chains, which improves the lives and livelihoods of everyone they touch. Such a fine focus would make them better able to buy modern technologies and to build the most innovative power plants. “Activism is highly focused, targeted and goals oriented,” says Richard Rudden, managing partner of Target Rock Advisors, in an earlier interview. “It brings the issues and stakeholder pressures directly to boards and managements for action.” It is more advantageous to keep a seat at the table rather than to cut off any direct line of communications through divestiture, Rudden says. Nevertheless, if investors have authorized pension plan fiduciaries to make “socially responsible investments,” then they have a legal right to divest, or in the case of banks, to quit making loans to businesses that don’t meet such objectives, he adds. While addressing climate change is vital, the value of fossils fuels remain high, say others:  “Over the past two centuries, fossil fuels have liberated most of the world’s population from short, brutal lives of grinding poverty,” adds Richard Bezdek, who is president of Management Information Services and who receives financial backing by the fossil fuel industry. Bezdek goes on to say that both the International Energy Agency and the U.S. Energy Information Administration peg renewables in 2040 at only 15 percent of the world energy portfolio — certainly not enough to displace much of the gas-or-coal-fired electric generation. The sustainability evolution, however, is occurring because activists, investors and regulators are uniting to make companies live up to higher standards. Those who espouse such shareholder activism maintain that their pursuits are adding corporate value and overall prosperity.  Major retailers and industrials that include Walmart, General Electric and Dow Chemical are leading the charge.  Walmart, for example, is the first retailer with an emissions-reduction plan approved by the Science Based Targets Initiative, in alignment with the Paris Climate Agreement in December 2015. It will use a combination of energy-efficiency measures and renewable energy to achieve an 18 percent emissions reduction in its own operations by 2025, it says. Additionally, Walmart will work with suppliers to reduce emissions by 1 Gigaton by 2030, equivalent to taking more than 211 million passenger vehicles off of U.S. roads and highways for a year. “If sustainability is done right, there is a return on investment,” notes Neil Myers. founding principal at the consulting firm Williams Creek.  If Big Oil makes that choice, it is only a matter of time before others follow its lead.

Elyse Betters22 May 2017Apps Amazon Facebook Twitter Pintrest LinkedIn Google+ Mail Comment Remember Amazon Go? Well, Amazon might bring it to the UK. The online retailer could soon export its experimental checkout-less grocery store to the UK, if a recent trademark registration of "No Queue. No Checkout. (No, Seriously.)" is to be taken seriously. The slogan mirrors ones used by Amazon when it introduced the first Go store last December. Amazon even has similar trademarks currently going through the European Union's Intellectual Property Office. Amazon began testing a grocery store with no checkouts and no cashiers in downtown Seattle last year. But the store is only open to Amazon staff. It allows customers to walk in, grab items from the shelves, and walk out - without having to stand in a checkout line or cash out at a register. Amazon has been using the tagline "No Line. No Checkout. (No, Seriously.)" when marketing Go stores in the US. Alexa is now available on Fire tablets in the UK Amazon Echo Show: Release date, price and everything you need to know Amazon now offers an even better Fire tablet for kids There are rumours that Amazon hopes to one day open 2,000 grocery and convenience stores across the US. The Go-branded stores might even have multiple formats, allowing Amazon to better rival Target and Walmart. But, up until now, we've heard nothing but Amazon's plans of expanding Go internationally. We've therefore contacted Amazon for a comment and will update you when we know more. The Amazon Go experience is meant to make shopping less tedious and time-consuming. The system uses machine learning, sensors, and artificial intelligence to track items you pick up in the store and then it adds those items to a virtual cart in Amazon's app. Once you have everything you want, you can just go, and Amazon will charge you accordingly. It calls this process "Just walk out technology". Keep in mind Amazon already offers online grocery ordering and delivery in select areas in the UK.  Can I get Amazon Prime Now one-hour deliveries in my area?

Facebook Twitter Google + Email Print Turkey taps longtime Trump lobbyist By Mary Lee 05/22/2017 02:18 PM EDT With David Beavers, Taylor Gee, Kelsey Tamborrino and Aubree Eliza Weaver TURKEY TAPS LONGTIME TRUMP LOBBYIST: Brian Ballard, President Donald Trump’s longtime lobbyist, just inked a high-profile contract of $1.5 million with Turkey, adding to Ballard Partners’ trifecta of international clients, including the Dominican Republic and the Socialist Party of Albania. Former Rep. Robert Wexler (D-Fla.) will represent the firm’s highest profile foreign client, reports POLITICO’s Marc Caputo. Previously, PI reported Wexler is new to lobbying and is still serving as president of the S. Daniel Abraham Center for Middle East Peace. Story Continued Below WHITE HOUSE BID TO BLOCK ETHICS INQUIRY: A recent letter from OMB Director Mick Mulvaney to Walter M. Shaub Jr., the head of the Office of Government Ethics, has positioned the government’s top ethics watchdog in an escalating standoff against the White House. Shaub had requested copies of ethics waivers granted to former lobbyists and industry lawyers. “The White House, however, tried on Wednesday to stop the process across the entire federal government, even before most agencies had responded to Mr. Shaub’s April 28 request,” Eric Lipton reports for The New York Times. ”Keeping the waivers confidential would make it impossible to know whether any such officials are violating federal ethics rules or have been given a pass to ignore them.” Full story. — “This is not normal,” Norman Eisen, former ethics czar under President Barack Obama told POLITICO. “It smacks of intimidation under the circumstances, as OMB does not have the right to quash OGE's functioning. Ethics and the rule of law require transparency, and Trump's insistence on hiding lobbyist and other waivers, aided and abetted by OMB, is the latest salvo in this administration's attack on good government.” FORMER OBAMA APPOINTEE JOINS QUAKER LOBBY: Anthony Wier, former deputy assistant secretary in the State Department’s Bureau of Legislative Affairs under President Barack Obama, has joined the Quaker lobby Friends Committee on National Legislation as the organization’s lead lobbyist for nuclear disarmament and Pentagon spending. “We’re making a big focus to rein in on mindless increases to military spending and advocate for smarter policies in our foreign policy that make more sense — out of a fundamental belief of our organization that we can’t kill our way to victory,” Wier told POLITICO. Prior to joining FCNL, he worked for 10 years for Congress and the State Department on nuclear nonproliferation issues and international security policy. Good afternoon, and welcome to PI.

CONSERVATIVE GROUPS DING TRUMP’S SCHOOL CHOICE PROPOSALS — Conservative groups are not thrilled with Trump’s plan to funnel an additional $1 billion into expanding school choice, even though they usually support such policies. “Conservative think tanks like The Heritage Foundation and the American Enterprise Institute say that ponying up an extra $1 billion in federal Title I funding to promote school choice creates a bigger footprint in education policy — something they cannot abide,” POLITICO’s Caitlin Emma reports. Full story. SPEAKING OF EDUCATION — The main lobbying association representing for-profit colleges is releasing its wish list today for a reauthorization of the Higher Education Act. The group, Career Education Colleges and Universities, plans to pitch its ideas as a way to “make the Higher Education Act a jobs bill” and to “modernize” the law for the 21st century.

DRONE LOBBYISTS TO DESCEND ON CAPITOL HILL — “Expect drone groups representing both commercial users and hobbyists to storm the Hill in the coming months to ask for legislative language” after a federal appeals court threw out the FAA’s registration requirement for recreational drone users on Friday, reports POLITICO’s Morning Transportation. The Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International and the Small UAV Coalition have already issued statements pledging to work with lawmakers on the issue.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Eugene Volokh By Eugene Volokh May 22 at 3:16 PM Follow @volokhc From Commonwealth v. Kushmanick, which was decided last year by a Pennsylvania appellate court, but which I just came across last week (all quotes are from the opinion): 1. The facts: Kushmanick started dating S.C. when he was 18 or 19, and she was 16 (according to defendant, just a week shy of her 17th birthday). The age of consent for sexual activity generally in Pennsylvania is 16. (There is the possibility that someone may be prosecuted for “corrupting the morals of a minor” when the minor is 16 or 17, but this was not an issue raised in this case.) As part of their relationship — according to Kushmanick, after S.C. turned 17 — he would photograph S.C. naked. “The photographs depicted S.C. naked in a blatantly sexual way. However, the photographs also graphically establish that S.C. was a willing and voluntary model.” Her face was apparently not visible on the photographs, but she recognized them at trial because of various items of clothing and linens they depicted. “When the relationship ended between the parties, S.C. asked [Defendant] to delete the photographs from his cell phone.” Kushmanick didn’t do that, but he apparently never displayed the photographs to anyone else. 2. The prosecution: In late 2013, a police officer got access to defendant’s phone (with a warrant) “as a result of an unrelated investigation” and found the pictures, which led to the prosecution of defendant for creating and possessing child pornography. Defendant was convicted and “sentenced to 18 months of probation” but was also “classified as a Tier III offender … and thus subject to the lifetime registration requirement.” The relevant statutes provide: (1) Any person who causes or knowingly permits a child under the age of 18 years to engage in a prohibited sexual act or in the simulation of such act commits an offense if such person knows, has reason to know or intends that such act may be photographed, videotaped, depicted on computer or filmed. (2) Any person who knowingly photographs, videotapes, depicts on computer or films a child under the age of 18 years engaging in a prohibited sexual act or in the simulation of such an act commits an offense….. … Any person who intentionally views or knowingly possesses or controls any book, magazine, pamphlet, slide, photograph, film, videotape, computer depiction or other material depicting a child under the age of 18 years engaging in a prohibited sexual act or in the simulation of such act commits an offense. “Prohibited sexual act” is defined as various sexual acts or “lewd exhibition of the genitals or nudity if such nudity is depicted for the purpose of sexual stimulation or gratification of any person who might view such depiction.” The definition does not include any requirement that the act be criminal independently of its being recorded. 3. The majority decision: [W]e agree with [Defendant ]that the conduct at issue herein is not of the type which the legislature intended to punish. “The purpose of Section 6312 is plainly to protect children, end the abuse and exploitation of children, and eradicate the production and supply of child pornography.” The facts of this case do not establish abuse or exploitation of S.C., or that Defendant’s actions led to the supply of child pornography. [Footnote: Indeed, the only record evidence of dissemination of the pornography at issue is the Commonwealth’s production of it at trial.] Here, Defendant and S.C. were permitted by law to engage in sexual activity. Thus, the acts depicted in the photography on Defendant’s phone were not “prohibited sexual acts” between these parties. In view of these circumstances, and the maxim “Cessante ratione legis cessat et ipsa lex” [“When the reason of the law ceases, the law itself also ceases”], we conclude that the reasons behind subsections 6312(b) and (d) are inapplicable to the photography in this case. Therefore, … we reverse [Defendant]’s convictions. 4. The dissent, by Judge Mundy: The Majority does not conclude the Commonwealth’s evidence is insufficient for a failure to satisfy any of the elements of sexual abuse of children. Likewise, the Majority does not dispute that neither lack of consent, nor dissemination is an element under [the statute]…. Rather, the Majority deems the Commonwealth’s case legally insufficient because of the maxim cessante ratione legis cessat et ipsa lex. This maxim has never been applied to void an otherwise legally sufficient criminal conviction. [In the words of the trial court,] [Defendant]’s argument has equitable and common sense appeal. Unfortunately, his arguments are not legally cognizable. [does not distinguish between consensual photographs taken by two adventurous, experimenting teens and photographs created by sexual predators for the pedophilic gratification of themselves or others. While certainly ironic, the fact that [Defendant] and S.C. were legally permitted to engage in sexual activity is not a defense [under the statute]. … It is not the role of the judiciary to change the law. Rather, any changes to [the statute] must come from the legislature…. [Footnote:] The Majority appears to equate “prohibited sexual act” in [the statute] with a criminal act. However, [the statute] defines the term “prohibited sexual act” as “[s]exual intercourse …, masturbation, sadism, masochism, bestiality, fellatio, cunnilingus, lewd exhibition of the genitals or nudity if such nudity is depicted for the purpose of sexual stimulation or gratification of any person who might view such depiction.” The statute therefore does not depend on the legality or illegality of the underlying act, rather it depends on depicting a child under the age of 18 engaging in any of the listed “prohibited sexual acts.” 5. The precedent: Neither the majority nor the dissent cited State v. Kitchen, a similar 2002 Pennsylvania appellate case (which was affirmed without opinion by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in 2003). Here was the argument of defendant’s lawyer, Elizabeth Judd, distinguishing Kitchen: The victim in [Kitchen] testified: [S]he was a sixteen years of age when she moved into Appellant’s apartment where the two lived together for about eighteen months. She testified that during those months, Appellant photographed her over sixty times in sexually explicit poses despite the fact she was under the age of eighteen. She admitted that while they were living together she and Appellant had a child, and Appellant continued to take photographs, before, during and after her pregnancy. A number of photographs were introduced into evidence, which the victim retrieved from the Walmart Store where they had been developed. She also testified that she and the Appellant had argued about other sexually explicit photographs which he had taken, kept and refused to return. The defendant in Kitchen, whose age was not disclosed, argued his relationship with the minor should preclude a conviction. He focused on the principle that a minor may consent to sexual intercourse with an adult. The Court rejected the argument and affirmed the conviction. [The] circumstances [of the Defendant in this case] are distinguishable. He was a peer of S.C., never allowed the photographs to be seen by any other party and there was never a dispute with the involved minor about the photos. His inexperience of youth prevented him from making a sound moral judgement. His intentions were motived by a sense of sexual experimentation with a peer not a pedophilic desire, which is the activity the Legislature intended to address. (For another interesting Pennsylvania child porn case, see Miller v. Skumanick, which dealt with a threat to prosecute minors for possessing suggestive photos they took of themselves; but that case was not brought up either in the opinion or in the briefs.) 6. The policy: In my experience, many people have the reaction, “If you can have sex with each other, you should be able to photograph each other having sex (or just naked).” That’s a perfectly sensible reaction; after all, if 16-year-olds are allowed to consent to activities that can cause pregnancy and disease, why not let them consent to mere photography as well? But I thought that I’d also lay out how the policy argument might go in favor of criminalizable photos of under-18-year-old sex partners even if actual sex with the partners is legal, just so readers can consider it: A. Under-18-year-olds are too immature to consent to actions that could cause them serious long-term harm. That might be a good reason to ban people from having sex with them (which can cause pregnancy, disease and serious emotional pain in the event of a breakup). And it is a good reason to ban people from photographing them naked or in sexual contexts (which can cause humiliation if they are publicized and can be used for purposes of extortion). B. At the same time, trying to shield under-18-year-olds from such harms also interferes with their liberty; we might therefore allow them to engage in dangerous behavior at some age below 18, in order to diminish this interference. We might let them use deadly devices (such as cars), which may be important for work and education. We might let them engage in deadly activities (such as sex), and free others to be partners in such activities, when such activities may be very emotionally important to them. But when an activity is dangerous but less important (such as sexual photography), we can reasonably tell them (and their prospective partners), “Want to have your boyfriend take sexual pictures of you? Fine, but just wait until 18, when you might have a more mature judgment on the matter.” Indeed, maybe this might help the under-18-year-olds avoid pressure to engage in such behavior when (as often happens) they would consent but against their better judgment. C. Likewise, trying to ban behavior that is extremely common, especially when experience shows that total bans are extremely likely to be regularly flouted (perhaps because under-18-year-olds might so want to engage in such behavior), can cause various problems — disrespect for the legal system more generally, wrongly selective prosecution, overcriminalization and so on. That may be good reason to set the age of consent at some age below 18 (as indeed three-fourths of all states do). But sexual photography isn’t likely to be as common, or as resistant to regulation, as sex itself, so a ban on sexual photography of under-18-year-olds may still be sensible. So I think it’s not outright irrational to set up a higher age of consent for sexual photography than for sex (even though the potential harms of sex are indeed greater than the potential harms of sexual photography). Query, though, whether this still makes sense — and what the right punishment for such sexual photography ought to be. (I do think it makes no sense to require registration as a sex offender for this behavior, especially if the defendant is close in age to the partner; the point of registration is to better monitor people who may commit serious sex crimes in the future, and that just doesn’t seem likely as to such close-in-age sexual photographers.) opinions volokh-conspiracy Dallas shooting updates News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 follow-dallas false after3th false Please provide a valid email address.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Amy Ellis Nutt By Amy Ellis Nutt May 22 at 2:15 PM Follow amyellisnutt For the first time, the American Society of Plastic Surgeons has released data on procedures for transgender people, which can include facial and body contouring, in addition to gender-reassignment surgery. (American Society of Plastic Surgeons) More than 3,200 transgender surgeries, from “facial and body contouring” to actual “gender reassignment,” were performed in the United States last year, the American Society of Plastic Surgeons said Monday in releasing the first such numbers ever reported. The 2016 total, reflecting a rapid evolution of public attitudes and health coverage, represented a 19 percent increase from the previous year, the data show. The numbers rose in all categories, with male-to-female confirmation surgeries climbing by 27 percent and female-to-male operations by 10 percent. The statistics reflect only procedures performed by board-certified members of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, which only recently began tracking the procedures. Until now, U.S. transgender data of all kinds have been hard to come by — because of poor research surveys, limitations in the gender language on medical records and the reluctance of the transgender community to discuss its status. [Nearly four decades after its pioneering transgender program was shut down, Johns Hopkins is resuming where it left off] “The changes over the last four or five years — societal, insurance, the generally favorable media attention — have resulted in a dramatic increase in the number of surgeries,” said Loren Schechter, an ASPS member who has been performing transgender procedures in the Chicago area for the past two decades. “The barriers were hospitals,” Schechter noted. “It was extremely difficult to get hospitals to agree. Some for financial reasons, some were faith-based institutions, some we never got clear-cut answers, they just said 'No.' At the time, many people had to leave the country for surgery. Then the winds started to change.” A 2014 ruling by a U.S. Health and Human Services Department review board was a watershed moment, Schechter said, overturning Medicare's 33-year ban on covering gender-confirmation surgery. The earlier decision explained that the procedure was still considered experimental, medically risky and controversial. A number of organizations, including the American Civil Liberties Union, sued in 2013 to end the ban. Their plaintiff was Denee Mallon, then 74. The Albuquerque senior had spent 30 years being denied the opportunity to fully transition from male to female. At first, it was the lack of support from psychiatrists, whom she needed to approve the surgery, then it was the lack of money. [Truth and transgender at age 70: a marriage of nearly 50 years survives -- and thrives] It took suing the federal government for the funds to help her over the last hurdle. Mallon was shopping in Walmart when one of her lawyers reached her with news of the review board's action. She could have the surgery — if she could find a surgeon who took Medicare. Schechter, at Weiss Memorial Hospital in Chicago, was just the person she'd been looking for. The following year, Mallon was wheeled into an operating room — becoming one of the 2,740 people to have a gender-confirmation procedure in 2015, according to the data just released by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. “When I woke up from surgery, I felt a certain sense of peace and tranquility,” she recounted Sunday. Schechter pointed out that while Medicare “changed its blanket denial,” it allowed final coverage decisions to be made on a case-by-case basis. [Meet the gender affirmation surgeon who calls herself "the Georgia O'Keefe of genitalia"] Fewer than 100 board-certified plastic surgeons, in 11 states, are doing gender-confirmation procedures. Alan Matarasso, incoming president-elect for the ASPS, thinks their ranks will grow rapidly with more educational and training opportunities. And the number of surgeries could double in the next five years, he expects. “Like many things, its time has come,” he said. “It often takes a series of events that makes the timing right. Media attention and Caitlyn Jenner didn’t hurt, also the political climate that we’re in that’s perhaps more accepting of this. We have a greater understanding of the needs of this population. … This is a biological condition, not an illness.” national health-science to-your-health Dallas shooting updates News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 follow-dallas false after3th false Please provide a valid email address.

Tags: glucose syrup, organic vitamins, vitamins (Natural News) Last year, Brits spent more money on vitamins than painkillers. On the surface, this sounds like good news because painkillers have been associated with many concerning side effects. However, it turns out that some of the vitamins on the market are not exactly doing their bodies any favors. The UK multivitamin industry is worth a half billion pounds a year. Just under half of Brits report taking vitamins and minerals daily, and that number has been rising over the past few years. Lots of these people are turning to supplements in an attempt to make up for poor eating habits. Kate Quilton of Food Unwrapped, which airs on Channel 4 in the UK, headed to our shores to visit IVC Industries, a vitamin producer in New Jersey, where she discovered that most of the ingredients in vitamins are actually synthetic. International Vitamin Corporation (IVC) Product Development Head Nick Bennett told her that the ingredients in their vitamins are synthesized using fermentation in order to produce such large quantities, and the process is far from appetizing. “Bacteria will be fed glucose syrup, and they will convert that into a whole variety of different vitamins and we extract the individual ones out that we want,” he said. Glucose syrup? Does that set off any alarm bells? With nearly 90 percent of the corn grown in our nation being genetically modified, the thought of using glucose syrup — which is usually made with this same GM corn — in something that is supposed to boost our health is completely absurd. It doesn’t stop there. Many cheap vitamins you find at places like WalMart contain ingredients like maltodextrin, another ingredient that is typically derived from GM corn. Meanwhile, many Vitamin C pills are made using genetically modified Vitamin C. Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, found a disturbing amount of lead and other toxins when investigating supplements for his book, Food Forensics. This is why it’s vital to buy vitamins from trusted sources. What is the point of following a healthy, organic diet if you’re just going to introduce toxic ingredients into your body when you take vitamins? Getting vitamins from food sources is ideal For the show, Quilton also headed to Houston, where she spoke to Dr. Scott Smith, the head of NASA’s Nutritional Biochemistry lab. Surprisingly, he said that he does not give astronauts food supplements in their diets as their food contains all the vitamins they need. Interestingly, there is one vitamin that astronauts are provided with: Vitamin D. While you and I can simply head outside for a few minutes to get all the Vitamin D our bodies need from the sun, astronauts don’t have that option, and Vitamin D is considered so essential that they need to supplement. If you’re concerned that you’re not getting enough of the vitamins you need from your diet, the best course of action is to simply adapt your diet. Seek out organic foods that are naturally rich in the vitamins your body needs. If that isn’t possible for some reason, you’ll need to do some research to find safe organic vitamins that come from trusted sources, preferably with credible lab results that show they are free from toxins. Don’t let something that is supposed to be a healthy habit make you ill!

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 22 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Tacos 4 Life Digs Deeper into Arkansas Roots ROGERS, Ark.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Tacos 4 Life, an Arkansas-based taco restaurant franchise, has announced the groundbreaking of its newest location in Rogers, Arkansas. This site will be the seventh corporate store in Arkansas, and the third in the northwest region of the state. The restaurant is expected to open in early 2018. „We are so excited to have a new Tacos 4 Life location settled in Rogers,” said co-founder Ashton Samuelson, who created the company with her husband Austin. „Our customers are dedicated to our delicious food, eclectic style and chef-inspired menu so we are confident this new location will fit right in with the culture of NWA.” The groundbreaking is scheduled to occur in the upcoming weeks, and will be located at 4195 Pinnacle Hills Parkway in Rogers. Construction is expected to start in the next 30 – 60 days. Tacos 4 Life’s newest addition will aid in continuing its mission of fighting to end childhood hunger around the world. „The timely expansion of our Rogers location means we not only get to expand our corporate footprint, but also take one step closer to ending childhood hunger,” said co-founder Austin Samuelson. „With every new store opening, we have the opportunity to provide meals to thousands of starving children around the world through Feed My Starving Children. Rogers is the perfect city for our new location because of its family-oriented community that can truly get behind our mission.” Northwest Arkansas is home to many large corporate headquarters including Walmart, J.B. Hunt, and Tyson. Tacos 4 Life considers the substantial growth in NWA, and growing demand for fast-casual restaurants the perfect environment for its store to thrive. About Tacos 4 Life The first Tacos 4 Life Grill opened in Conway, Arkansas, on June 9th, 2014, but this is not where the story begins. Long before Tacos 4 Life opened its doors, Austin and Ashton Samuelson had a heart for the hungry. In 2009, they learned that over 18,000 children were dying worldwide each day due to starvation and hunger related causes. What surprised them is that the problem was completely preventable. Starvation is nothing more than a distribution problem. This simple fact moved them so much that they knew they could, and should, do something to help solve this problem. Thus, Tacos 4 Life was born. The Samuelsons believe that God is up to something big and can use Tacos 4 Life, which exists to serve amazing food and to empower communities to fight to end world hunger, to help solve the world’s most solvable problem. Tacos 4 Life is a highly-differentiated restaurant that offers chef-inspired, award winning menu items served in a unique environment. Our philosophy is based on delivering an unforgettable experience . . . great food, genuine service, and a mission focus that changes the world with every meal.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 22 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Grand Opening of New Springdale Sam’s Club Set for Thursday SPRINGDALE, Ark.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–The newest Sam’s Club in Northwest Arkansas will open its doors Thursday, May 25 at 1517 S. 56th St. in Springdale. The public is invited to join the celebration, which kicks off with a grand opening ceremony at 8 a.m. Olympic gymnast and gold medalist Laurie Hernandez will join the celebration later that day with a meet and greet with fans. The new club is located in a rapidly growing area just off I-49 in Springdale near the Arvest Ballpark and the future Arkansas Children’s Northwest. “The opening of a new Sam’s Club is exciting news for any community, but I can’t imagine any city being more excited than Springdale,” said Springdale Mayor Doug Sprouse. “Our residents have been eagerly anticipating the return of Sam’s Club, and this new location will not only benefit Springdale families, but will also spur future development in our overlay district.” New club features The Springdale location has a new look and feel based on some of the successful features from the Bentonville club remodel. The club will feature a Fresh Island that offers organic and grass-fed beef, an expanded seafood section, and fresh sushi made daily. The focus on fresh carries throughout the dairy and produce departments with large walk-in coolers designed to keep products as fresh as possible. An additional feature members will experience is an updated café with self-order kiosks, expanded seating with charging stations and an updated menu that includes premium coffee, made-to-order sandwiches, and smoothies. Members can continue to count on Sam’s Club for their health and wellness needs. The new club will provide pharmacy services as well as a hearing center and optical department. Shopping made simple Members of the Springdale club can utilize the company’s award winning smartphone app called Scan & Go, which allows users the option of scanning their items while they shop and simply paying on their phone in lieu of the traditional checkout experience. The Springdale club will also offer the drive-thru convenience of Club Pickup – a concierge service for members who prefer to place an online order and pick merchandise up at a scheduled time. Commitment to community As part of the grand opening festivities, Sam’s Club will be awarding nearly $20,000 in grants to several local nonprofit organizations. About half of that amount was raised through the company’s Volunteerism Always Pays (VAP) program. Springdale associates have volunteered nearly 700 hours already this year, raising funds for area programs such as the Fallen Soldier Memorial Project in Springdale and Big Brothers Big Sisters of Northwest Arkansas. “Our associates have been eager to help local organizations that support our community,” said Springdale Club Manager Mark Byrd. “I couldn’t be more excited about the great team we have in place that is passionate about giving back and serving our members.” Sam’s Club is also proud to support small business owners through the company’s Road Show program. This consignment-based program provides local, regional, and national entrepreneurs the chance to set up shop inside Sam’s Club while providing members access to exciting and one-of-a-kind products. Springdale’s grand opening will feature several local products including House of Webster gourmet salsa and Cedar Lake Mount Comfort Coffee. Members will also enjoy Nature Nate’s Honey, Blues Hog BBQ sauce, and Rawlings Leather Goods. Entrepreneurs interested in participating in future Road Shows should contact their local Sam’s Club manager for more details. Grand opening ceremony to feature local officials, special events Springdale Mayor Doug Sprouse and Springdale Chamber of Commerce President Perry Webb will be among those attending Thursday’s grand opening ceremony. The American Legion will present the colors and the Har-Ber High School Glee Club will perform the national anthem. Other groups providing entertainment during the ceremony include the Walmart Choir and Mariachi Amistad de Arkansas band. To add to the excitement, gymnast and Olympic gold medalist, Laurie Hernandez will be signing autographs for fans on grand opening day from 3 p.m. to 5 p.m. Her appearance is made possible by Procter & Gamble. Membership information Being a member of Sam’s Club means more than a membership card – it means exclusive access to great products, brands and services, at amazing values. Sam’s Club memberships range from $45 to $100. As part of a grand opening membership promotion, residents can get a $20 gift card when they sign up as a new member through June 4. Membership teams are available at the Sam’s Club fuel station to sign up members prior to Thursday’s grand opening. About Sam’s Club Sam’s Club®, a division of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.

We know it from the Dukes of Hazzard car, but the Confederate battle flag has a bitter history By Felix Allen 22nd May 2017, 4:46 pm Updated: 22nd May 2017, 6:44 pm Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Comments WE might know it best from the car in the Dukes of Hazzard but the Confederate battle flag has a bitter history that continues to cause controversy to this day. Trump supporters have sparked outrage by waving the symbol, which has been banned by Amazon because of its associations with white supremacist killers and the Ku Klux Klan. AP:Associated Press 4 Protesters fly the confederate flag as they call for the notorious symbol to be reinstated to the top of the Capitol building in Montgomery, Alabama What is the Confederate flag? The flag is based on battle flags used by a number of armies in the American civil war between Southern slave-owning states and rest of the Union in the north. The most well known was the banner flown by General Lee’s Army of Northern Virginia. It bore the familiar white stars on a blue cross set against a red background. After the war it became a symbol of rebel pride and was also known as the Dixie flag and the Southern Cross. Later in the early 20th century it was adopted by the Ku Klux Klan as it waged a terror campaign against black people. Its appearance in the 1939 film Gone With The Wind inspired a widespread nostalgia for the flag a symbol of the Old South. Supporters who use it today say it represents Southern US heritage and the sovereignty of individual states. It still appears in the corner of the official flag of Mississippi, the only US state flag that includes it since Georgia changed its design in 2001. Rex Features 4 The Confederate flag was adopted by the Ku Klux Klan as it launched a campaign of terror against black people in the Southern United States Why is the Confederate flag considered racist? Although some take pride in its history, the battle flag also became a potent symbol of slavery and white supremacy in the Unites States. Today neo-Nazi groups often display it alongside swastikas and other race hate motifs. According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, the Confederate battle flag “is one of the most controversial symbols from US history. “To many white Southerners, the flag is an emblem of regional heritage and pride. “But to others, it has a starkly different meaning — representing racism, slavery and the country’s long history of oppression of African Americans.” It adds: “It’s difficult to make the case today that the Confederate flag is not a racist symbol.” It was widely used by those who opposed the end of racial segregation in the 1950s and 1960s – at the same time as it began to be flown over state capitols and city halls across the South. Debate over the controversial symbol arose again when white supremacist Dylann Roof murdered nine worshippers at a black church in Charleston, South Carolina, in June 2015. He had posed with the flag and called for a “race war”. In February a couple were jailed for terrorising a child’s birthday party by carrying Confederate flags and shouting racist slogans. Rex Features 4 Dylann Roof posed with a Confederate flag before murdering nine black worshippers at a church in South Carolina in 2015 Where has the Confederate flag been banned? The toxic association with racists has meant the flag is increasingly seen as offensive in much of the United States. In the wake of the Charleston shooting, the state governor ordered the Confederate flag be removed from display at the Carolina State House where it had flown for 54 years. The governor of Alabama ordered a similar ban. Leading US retailers including Walmart, Sears Amazon and eBay announced bans on the sale of Confederate flag merchandise. Johnna Hoff of eBay said the flag had “become a contemporary symbol of divisiveness and racism.” Getty Images 4 The Confederate flag seemed harmless when it was painted on the roof of the General Lee in TV favourite Dukes of Hazzard The following month, a US cable channel ditched repeats of 1980s kids’ show Dukes of Hazzard because the flag appears on the roof of the iconic orange Dodge Charger called General Lee. John Schneider, one of the stars of the series, said he was “saddened and angry” at the “overly PC” edict. He blasted: “Are people who grew up watching the show now suddenly racists?” Last summer a Trump supporter was ordered to take his flag down at a rally in Florida. Hundreds of other supporters have proudly waved the flag during the election and after his inauguration in January. In November a policeman in Michigan had to quit after he flew one on his pickup truck while off-duty. Last month the schools board in Orange County, California, said it was considering banning the flag after it was used to bully kids. And, in this country, Geordie Shore Marnie Simpson shocked viewers by wearing a Kanye West Yeezus 2013 tour jacket with a Confederate flag on the sleeve.

President Donald Trump has ordered 5,000 new Border Patrol positions. Astrid Galvan AP Immigration May 22, 2017 12:05 PM Trump plan to boost Border Patrol is in trouble By Glenn Garvin ggarvin@miamiherald.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story When a U.S. Senate committee voted recently for a bill that would end lie-detector tests for some job applicants at the U.S. Border Patrol, it was a stark recognition that one of the major components of President Donald Trump’s plan to stop illegal immigration — a hiring surge of 5,000 new agents in the Border Patrol — is in serious trouble. Snarled by a combination of bureaucratic torpor and the economic reality that not many qualified applicants find the job attractive, not only has the Border Patrol failed to make any of the new hires, it hasn’t even been able to fill the 1,700 positions it had open at the time of Trump’s January order to expand. “Five thousand new agents, we all knew that was pie in the sky,” said Zack Taylor, head of the National Association of Former Border Patrol Officers. “They’ll be lucky if they can find 500.” And an unusual coalition of immigration hawks and doves predicts that attempts at a speedy mass hiring will touch off a tidal wave of misconduct, corruption and even narcotrafficker spying within the Border Patrol as applicants with dubious skills and sinister intention take advantage of softer requirements. “Given all the problems the Border Patrol has had finding new agents, we’ve been sort of unclear on how the Trump administration thought it was going to be able not to just quickly get the organization up to strength, but to hire 5,000 more,” said Joshua Breisblatt, a policy analyst at the American Immigration Council, an immigrant-rights group. “The answer is that they’re going to have to find ways to make it easier to hire agents, and that could easily end in disaster.” ...they’re going to have to find ways to make it easier to hire agents, and that could easily end in disaster. Joshua Breisblatt, American Immigration Council Agreed James Tomsheck, former head of the agency’s internal affairs section: “I think it’s going to be very difficult for them to accomplish this hiring surge...And in the process, they are likely to allow huge numbers of unsuitable people into the organization.” The shortage of Border Patrol agents has been chronic since 2001 when the George W. Bush administration, in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks, launched a crash hiring program that doubled their numbers over the next seven years. Border Patrol bosses are reluctant to discuss the shortage or how they’re coping with it. The agency’s Miami office, which oversees nearly 1,800 miles of coastal border stretching from North Carolina around Key West and to the northwestern tip of Florida, would say only that it regularly moves around agents and equipment to “where they can have the most impact.” A City of Miami Beach Police Officer and a U.S. Border Patrol agent at the scene on 16th street and Collins Avenue in Miami Beach where a makeshift sailboat with twelve cuban rafters and a dog arrived after being in the high seas for 6 days on Sept. 15, 2015. C.M. GUERRERO EL NUEVO HERALD But some former Border Patrol officials believe the lack of manpower is making the job more dangerous — especially if Trump’s ambitious plans for more aggressive border enforcement go into effect. “The job is still getting done, but it’s a thinner line than it should be, where the safety and security of Border Patrol agents are at greater risk,” said Tomsheck. “Border Patrol agents are at greater risk. They’re patrolling longer, mostly alone, at a greater distance from back-up.” The pressure of President Trump’s order for the surge in hiring — from the current 19,627 agents to 26,370 — is putting enormous pressure on a Border Patrol headquarters that, during the last budget cycle, said it wanted to cut money for 300 agents and spend it on vehicles and other equipment because “realistic agent hiring expectations” were that it couldn’t come up with that many warm bodies. Border Patrol agents are at greater risk. They’re patrolling longer, mostly alone, at a greater distance from back-up. James Tomsheck, former head Border Patrol’s internal affairs section Now the agency has changed strategies: It’s asking to ease the requirements for new agents. The Senate bill curtailing lie-detector tests for job applicants (the House is considering a nearly identical measure) is a response to a request from the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Acting Commissioner Kevin K. McAleenan, who said it was necessary to make the hiring process easier. In an internal memo that leaked out to news media in February, McAleenan wrote that in addition to easing the lie-detector requirements, the Border Patrol would need $2.2 billion and five years to carry out the hiring surge — and warned that even if the money and changes were approved, “we do not expect to see the impact” this year. McAleenan’s memo also touched on some of the other points that skeptics cite in arguing that the hiring surge is doomed: The job is dangerous — about 750 agents are assaulted every year, with 30 dead in the line of duty since 2003 — yet the Border Patrol doesn’t pay as well (starting salaries are as low as $40,000 a year) as other federal law-enforcement agencies competing for the same job applicants. Even when the Border Patrol signs a recruit, there’s a good chance that new agent won’t stay long — about 900 quit each year, according to the organization’s statistics. One major reason: Agents are often stationed in rough-and-tumble areas along the U.S border that offer little in the way of amenities or schools. “One agent told me, ‘the closest thing to culture in my territory is a Walmart 30 miles down the road,” said Tomsheck. facebook twitter email Share More Videos 0:55 Cubans stuck on bridge to U.S. after 'wet foot, dry foot' policy ends Pause 0:50 Protesters want Miami-Dade to defy Trump on immigration order 1:23 Haitians demand Trump administration extend Temporary Protected Status 0:53 Chaos after explosions at Ariana Grande concert 1:13 Haitian activists ask Trump for TPS extension 0:53 Meteor burning up over the Florida Keys caught on dashcam 1:05 DeVante Parker on game winning touchdown against the Los Angeles Rams 1:33 Sea lion pulls girl off the dock and into the water 0:59 Florida anaylst for PNC Bank discusses jobs report 0:31 Miami Worldcenter's 'Jam Room' Share Video Video link: Select Embed code: Select facebook twitter email Cubans stuck on bridge to U.S. after 'wet foot, dry foot' policy ends They were just a little too late. Cuban roofer Dennis Pupo Cruz leaned over the railing and called his sister in Miami to tell her he was stuck on the Mexican-side of the bridge above the Rio Grande River, inches from the U.S. border. Border Patrol agents stopped him or any of the other Cubans from entering into the United States. Brittany Peterson/McClatchy In some areas, especially along the Mexican border, even security is an issue. “A lot of the places where you have Border Patrol stations are also major alleys for narcotrafficking,” said Taylor. “And you’re gonna have your wife and child sitting there in the middle of it? A lot of guys say, no.” Some of those obstacles might be overcome with the blunt force of money. The difficulties associated with the lie-detector test are less easily resolved. Border Patrol says the problem with them is that they’re time-consuming and chill recruitment. But critics among both advocates and opponents of immigration argue that the real trouble with lie detector exams is that so many Border Patrol applicants flunk them because they’re drug users, criminals or even narcotrafficker spies. And easing the polygraph requirements at the very moment the Border Patrol is rushing to hire 7,000 new agents, they say, will result in a flood of corruption within the agency. “Putting 5,000 new agents on the ground real fast is exactly what you don’t need,” said Taylor. “Even one bad apple can do a lot of damage, and if you get a whole barrel of bad apples, it’s terrible.” In this April 9, 2017, photo, U.S. Border Patrol agents talk to visitors at a recruitment tent set up at the Country Thunder Music Festival in Florence, Ariz. David Kadlubowski AP That’s exactly what happened during the hiring surge of 2001. A steady drumbeat of arrests of Border Patrol agents soon began — nearly 200 since late 2004. And when the agency began requiring lie-detector tests for job applicants in 2008, Border Patrol bosses were horrified at the results. “We looked at a random sample of 1,000 polygraph results from job applicants — these were applicants who had been cleared by background checks — and about two-thirds of them had failed the polygraph test,” said Tomsheck, whose internal affairs unit oversaw the testing. “And the reason they were failing was truly shocking. “Many of them admitted involvement in felony crimes, including border-related crimes [like smuggling drugs or illegal immigrants]. There was one who admitted killing his infant son. Some had direct involvement with drug cartels, some admitted they had been sent by drug cartels to infiltrate the Border Patrol and pass intelligence back to the narcotraffickers.” Among the surge-hiring applicants who slipped into the Border Patrol before the lie detector tests were required was Ivhan Herrera-Chiang, generally regarded as one of the most corrupt agents in the organization’s history. Working secretly for the cartels, he looted his Yuma, Arizona, Border Patrol office for intelligence to pass back to the traffickers: maps of Border Patrol electronic sensors, locations of the agency’s traffic checkpoints, and even keys to locks on the gates of protective border fences. Most chillingly, Herrera-Chiang provided the cartels with information on law-enforcement informants in Mexico, including one the narcotraffickers planned to kill.

The USDA has recalled over 210,000 pounds of hot dogs made by John Morrell and Co under the Nathans’s Famous and Beef Master by Curtis brands. Metal fragments were found in the hot dogs, which were sold nationwide. According to the USDA, recalled items include: The beef franks items were produced on January 26, 2017. 14 oz. sealed film packages containing “Nathan’s SKINLESS 8 BEEF FRANKS,” with a Use By date of Aug. 19, 2017. 16 oz. sealed film packages containing “Curtis BEEF MASTER Beef Franks,” with a Use By date of June 15, 2017. You can view the labels of the recalled items. In Lubbock, only Walmart carried Nathan’s brand hot dogs, and items that meet the recall criteria have been removed. Of course, it should go without saying, do not eat these hot dogs and return them to the place of purchase for a full refund.

Not so fast: Many indicators suggest that retail employment is unlikely to shrivel and the economy will withstand any shock from the sector’s rout. Granted, the industry’s current woes can’t be ignored. Retail sales account for almost half of consumer spending, which in turn makes up about 70% of the economy. Retailers employ 15.9 million people, or about one in every 10 U.S. workers, and positions at certain types of stores may become harder to find. For starters, the broad trend in retail purchases is moving higher: Excluding auto dealers and gas stations, sales were up an annualized 4.6% over the past three months. Even with recent job losses, retail headcount is close to its 12-month average. Such figures suggest the industry is hardly about to shrink or fade away. Even with the “eye-catching headlines about store closings” and other recent struggles in retail, “we don’t see much of an effect on retail employment and therefore on consumer spending,” said Robert Sockin, an economist at UBS Securities, which issued research last week titled “Reports of Retail’s Death Have Been Greatly Exaggerated.” “As long as there’s demand for workers and the consumer stays healthy, that will keep the retail sector buoyant.” It’s true that store closings are already outpacing those of 2008, when the United States was in a deep recession, according to an April 6 report from Credit Suisse. About 2,880 announcements so far this year exceed the 1,153 over the same period of 2016, the investment bank said. Macy’s Inc., Sears Holdings Corp. and J.C. Penney Co. are shutting hundreds of locations combined, and shoe chain Payless Inc. recently joined the list of retailers filing for bankruptcy. Driving the doom and gloom are pockets of weakness such as department stores and clothing chains that are casualties in the battle between brick-and-mortar and e-commerce. While that has led to consolidation and a shift of market share from traditional and mall-based locations to more agile online businesses, the latter’s share of total retail sales remains below 10%. Employment data reflect the pain — general-merchandise stores lost jobs in five of the past six months while nonstore retailers are expanding payrolls, though not at a fast enough pace to make up for the shortfall. Still, e-commerce giant Amazon.com Inc. plans to hire more than 30,000 part-time workers over the next year, in addition to 100,000 full-time positions, for its growing network of warehouses around the country. With the industry in a so-called overbuilt situation, a real-estate shakeout is not uncommon every few years, and the rise of online retailers is worsening the distress this time. Underneath the hubbub is the news that some companies are actually expanding their selling space and realizing the need to have a strong presence both physically and online. Ulta Beauty Inc. plans to add 100 stores a year, with a goal of eventually having 1,700 U.S. locations. Amazon.com is opening bookstores and online eyeglasses-retailer Warby Parker is setting up more stores. Adding to the mix, Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the world’s biggest retailer, is intensifying its e-commerce push, while Kenneth Cole Productions plans to shutter stores in favor of selling on the Internet. Malls and their stores, while not as much of a destination as they were in their heyday, aren’t about to vanish completely. A report from Cowen & Co. shows most customers still prefer to shop in physical stores 75% of the time. Stores open and close all the time, so what really matters are net closings and net employment dictated by companies’ expansion and contraction rather than just store closings, according to UBS. Based on historical patterns, Sockin expects net retail jobs to rise in 2017. At 4.2%, the retail unemployment rate is below the nation’s 4.4%, and the industry’s job openings and quits — a measure of confidence in being able to find another job — each posted the second-best March in more than 15 years. And the American shopper, the pillar of the household spending-driven economy, remains on solid ground amid robust job growth, improving finances, and low borrowing costs. Even as department stores lose traffic, consumers are spending on services and shopping at sellers of health and beauty products, electronics, furniture. Their purchasing power is the best bet against the misplaced fear that the ailing retail industry is heading to the graveyard. As Jack Kleinhenz, chief economist at the National Retail Federation, put it, “while we’ve seen these headlines, the consumer hasn’t gone away.” By Sho Chandra Bloomberg News Follow Transport Topics on RSS Twitter Facebook © 2017, Transport Topics, American Trucking Associations Inc.

We know it from the Dukes of Hazzard car, but the Confederate battle flag has a bitter history By Felix Allen 22nd May 2017, 4:46 pm Updated: 22nd May 2017, 6:44 pm Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Comments WE might know it best from the car in the Dukes of Hazzard but the Confederate battle flag has a bitter history that continues to cause controversy to this day. Trump supporters have sparked outrage by waving the symbol, which has been banned by Amazon because of its associations with white supremacist killers and the Ku Klux Klan. AP:Associated Press 4 Protesters fly the confederate flag as they call for the notorious symbol to be reinstated to the top of the Capitol building in Montgomery, Alabama What is the Confederate flag? The flag is based on battle flags used by a number of armies in the American civil war between Southern slave-owning states and rest of the Union in the north. The most well known was the banner flown by General Lee’s Army of Northern Virginia. It bore the familiar white stars on a blue cross set against a red background. After the war it became a symbol of rebel pride and was also known as the Dixie flag and the Southern Cross. Later in the early 20th century it was adopted by the Ku Klux Klan as it waged a terror campaign against black people. Its appearance in the 1939 film Gone With The Wind inspired a widespread nostalgia for the flag a symbol of the Old South. Supporters who use it today say it represents Southern US heritage and the sovereignty of individual states. It still appears in the corner of the official flag of Mississippi, the only US state flag that includes it since Georgia changed its design in 2001. Rex Features 4 The Confederate flag was adopted by the Ku Klux Klan as it launched a campaign of terror against black people in the Southern United States Why is the Confederate flag considered racist? Although some take pride in its history, the battle flag also became a potent symbol of slavery and white supremacy in the Unites States. Today neo-Nazi groups often display it alongside swastikas and other race hate motifs. According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, the Confederate battle flag “is one of the most controversial symbols from US history. “To many white Southerners, the flag is an emblem of regional heritage and pride. “But to others, it has a starkly different meaning — representing racism, slavery and the country’s long history of oppression of African Americans.” It adds: “It’s difficult to make the case today that the Confederate flag is not a racist symbol.” It was widely used by those who opposed the end of racial segregation in the 1950s and 1960s – at the same time as it began to be flown over state capitols and city halls across the South. Debate over the controversial symbol arose again when white supremacist Dylann Roof murdered nine worshippers at a black church in Charleston, South Carolina, in June 2015. He had posed with the flag and called for a “race war”. In February a couple were jailed for terrorising a child’s birthday party by carrying Confederate flags and shouting racist slogans. Rex Features 4 Dylann Roof posed with a Confederate flag before murdering nine black worshippers at a church in South Carolina in 2015 Where has the Confederate flag been banned? The toxic association with racists has meant the flag is increasingly seen as offensive in much of the United States. In the wake of the Charleston shooting, the state governor ordered the Confederate flag be removed from display at the Carolina State House where it had flown for 54 years. The governor of Alabama ordered a similar ban. Leading US retailers including Walmart, Sears Amazon and eBay announced bans on the sale of Confederate flag merchandise. Johnna Hoff of eBay said the flag had “become a contemporary symbol of divisiveness and racism.” Getty Images 4 The Confederate flag seemed harmless when it was painted on the roof of the General Lee in TV favourite Dukes of Hazzard The following month, a US cable channel ditched repeats of 1980s kids’ show Dukes of Hazzard because the flag appears on the roof of the iconic orange Dodge Charger called General Lee. John Schneider, one of the stars of the series, said he was “saddened and angry” at the “overly PC” edict. He blasted: “Are people who grew up watching the show now suddenly racists?” Last summer a Trump supporter was ordered to take his flag down at a rally in Florida. Hundreds of other supporters have proudly waved the flag during the election and after his inauguration in January. In November a policeman in Michigan had to quit after he flew one on his pickup truck while off-duty. Last month the schools board in Orange County, California, said it was considering banning the flag after it was used to bully kids.

Carelessly graded exams are worthless, and only serve to punish children, teachers, and schools. So who grades the tests? 05/22/2017 06:45 am ET | Updated 16 hours ago https://criticalclassrooms.wordpress.com New York teachers protest secrecy behind Pearson Common Core exams. 550 You were stressed; your children were stressed; and the teachers in their school were stressed. But the ELA and Math tests are over and we don’t have to worry about the results until August. What we should be worrying about is who is marking them. Will graders be careful, thoughtful, and competent? Carelessly graded exams are worthless, and only serve to punish children, teachers, and schools. So who grades the tests? Pearson advertises for test graders on the website Indeed.com. The advertisement below is from Pearson’s Austin, Texas scoring center. They want college graduates (or equivalency?), any degree, and they are willing to pay $13 an hour, almost as much as a customer associate earns at Walmart, but significantly less than our test grader would make at Costco or Home Depot. Their “highly qualified” graders, unable to find or hold jobs in low paying service industries will be expected to “put aside personal biases,” evaluate “student responses to subject-related open-ended questions,” and “apply scoring guide according to customer requirements.” Similar positions are also available at Pearson’s Charlotte, North Carolina and Hadley, Massachusetts grading centers. Questar Assessment, which designs and grades tests for New York State has similar ads with similar qualifications for seasonal test scorers, but their ad does not list the hourly wage. However, according to the website Glassdoor, salaries range between $12 and $15 an hour an hour. In Florida, teacher and school administration candidates are protesting arbitrary certification tests that seem designed to produce high failure rates. According to a report by WPTV in West Palm Beach, since 2015 failure rates have significantly increased on the Florida Teacher Certification and Educational Leadership exams while Pearson profits from each failure. Up until 2009, the Florida Department of Education subsidized the tests, but no more. Candidates paid $25 to take each part of the multi-part tests and did not pay to retake a section that they failed. Pearson now charges test-takers up to $200 per section and an additional $20 to retake a section, an increase of 800 percent. Test-takers can appeal failing scores and pay $75 for a reevaluation. In January and February there were 871 appeals but only 15 scores were changed from fail to pass, less than 2 percent. Julie McCue, a veteran teacher with 21 years of classroom experience, a Master’s degree, and high evaluations from supervisors, is suing the Florida Department. Ms. McCue has failed the essay portion of the leadership exam four times with the exact same score and each of her grade appeals were rejected by Pearson. McCue believes the real failure is Pearson’s for hiring low paid unqualified test scorers.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 22 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman The Pulse Beverage Corp. (PLSB: OTCQB) | Pulse Beverage Released Its Quarterly Report for the Period Ended March 31, 2017 and Reports That Its Adjusted Net Operating Loss Narrowed by $55,872 an Improvement of 15.0% Over the Previous Years Comparable Period May 22, 2017 OTC Disclosure & News Service – DENVER, May 22, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — The Pulse Beverage Corporation („Pulse”) (OTCQB:PLSB) announced today that it had filed its Q1 FY2017 Quarterly Report (10-Q) with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission for the period ended March 31, 2017. For the 3-month period ended March 31, 2017 The Company reported gross sales of $368,442 vs $737,414 for the comparable period in 2016. This represents a decrease of $368,792 or 50.0%. This decrease is consistent with the planned 2016 restructuring of the Company’s operations that was designed to achieve higher sales per employee and to allow the Company to sell their wares directly to strategic retailers.  Also, at this same time, the Company was reintroducing their Lemonade and Limeade products in the new 16.9-ounce European glass format, which has been requested and received well by the retail trade. While these changes negatively affected revenues during the first quarter of 2017, our operating losses became narrower.  Management believes these changes will continue to reap benefits in the future, in the form of increased revenues and future profitability. For the 3-month period ended March 31, 2017 the Company’s net operating loss was $316,108 compared to a loss of $371,980 for the comparable period in 2016. This represents an improvement of $55,872 or 15.0% against a revenue decrease for the period of 50.0%. Total other expenses for the 3-month period ended March 31, 2017 was $1,014,869 compared to $185,288 in the comparable period in 2016 an increase of $829,581. This increase of $932,365 is primarily related to non-cash based Derivative Liabilities estimated expenses associated with the financing that the Company obtained which was needed to restructure and fund operations over the reporting period. These estimates may change based on the actual cost of these derivative liabilities as they are realized. Net loss for the 3-month period ended March 31, 2017 was $1,330,997 compared to $557,267 for the comparable period in 2016 an increase of $773,730. Excluding the non-cash Derivative Liabilities charges for the net loss for the 3-month period ended March 31, 2017 the net loss decreased to $398,632 from $557,267 an improvement of $158,635 or 28.5% for the comparable period in 2016. Robert Yates, CEO of Pulse, said, “I am very proud of our team at Pulse.  Our 2016 restructuring of our operations is starting to yield positive results.  Today, we are now able to do more with lower costs compared to the past.  Going forward, our new business processes are generating increases in product shipments.  As a result, we believe that our Company should be able to become profitable on an EBITDA basis during 2017 when we anticipate being able to achieve record quarterly sales.  Our goal is to earn a net income profit in 2018.” The Company is expecting to continue to reduce its debt exposure to TCA over the course of 2017 which may further positively impact our bottom line. (For more information about the Company’s finances and prospects please see our recently filed form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2016).

You can earn up to a 500 SB Bonus with this latest round of Swago. What is SWAGO you ask? It's a bingo-inspired promotion run by Swagbucks, a website that rewards you with points (called SB) for completing everyday online activities. You can redeem those SB for free gift cards. If you've never used Swagbucks, participating in SWAGO is a great introduction to the site and an easy way to earn a good amount of points quickly. See below for a new member sign up bonus code. Here’s what you need to know to get your 500 SB Bonus: 1. Register to play SWAGO at Swagbucks HERE. . If you don’t hit “Join” you won’t get credit for completing the action items. 2. Swago will begin on Monday May 22nd at 12:00 pm EDT. 3. Each square on your Swago Board will contain an action item to complete. They can be anything from getting a search win, earning SB in Surveys, or earning SB in nCrave, just to name a few. 4. Once you complete the action item in a particular square the square will change color signifying the action item is complete. 5. You have until 3 pm EST on Monday, May 29th to mark off as many squares as possible so use your time wisely. 6. Be mindful of the patterns and their corresponding bonuses located on the right of your Swago Board. The patterns will vary in difficulty and bonus value. 7. Once you’ve achieved a pattern, the corresponding “Submit” button will light up. You can have multiple patterns available for submission, however, you can only submit ONE pattern so choose wisely. 8. The game ends Monday, May 29th at 3pm EDT. Make sure to hit “Submit” on the pattern you wish to submit. If you don’t hit “Submit” before the game ends you won’t receive your SB bonus. For the veteran Swago Players, you’ll notice two new squares on this board: * Link your Debit/Credit Card with SB Local.

If you don't know about Swagbucks yet, it's the largest rewards website that gives people free gift cards for the things they do online (searching, shopping, watching videos, playing games and more). You earn points called SB for online activities and then you can cash them in for gift cards to places like Amazon, Target, Walmart, CVS, Lowes, Starbucks, Paypal, Bass Pro Shops, Kohl's and so many more! It's free to join and I have earned a bunch of gift cards in the many years I have been a member. How do you get these SB points? There are lots of ways. * Search online: Each time you need to search for something online, use the Swagbucks search engine on their website (instead of Google). I actually have the Swagbucks toolbar installed on my desktop and it places a search box right on my screen making it super easy to search. Every once in a while, they award SB points just for doing the searches I used to do using Google. * Take surveys on their website * Answer the daily poll * Watch videos through their website or multiple mobile apps (I earn about 80 - 100 SB a day doing this) * Use their online shopping portal (I do most of my online shopping at major retailers who are part of the Swagbucks Shop and Earn program (like Amazon.com, Kohls.com, Walmart.com and more) and earn Swagbucks every time I shop. Just this week, I was credited with 562 SB points (worth $5.62 in gift cards) for an online purchase I made a few weeks ago. * Play games * Participate in special Swag Code events * Enter the daily Swag Code (which we usually let you know about here on the blog each day). Swagbucks posts bonus codes on their Facebook, Twitter and blog pages each day. If you have the Swagbucks Mobile App, it will buzz when there is a new code. When the code becomes available each day, one of us posts it here on the blog so we can all get it. The codes are only valid for an hour usually. Once you get the code, you then copy and paste the code into the Swag Code box at the top of the homepage of Swagbucks.com. Look for the circle with the words Swag Code next to it. New member bonus Swagbucks sign-up code! As I posted above, new members get a 70 SB bonus when you sign up HERE. To get the bonus SB points, click the text that reads "I have a sign up code" during registration and then enter the code: SMARTSHOPPER to get the bonus.

CLOSE Politics Religion Sports Voting Laws Culture Health Immigration Technology Economy Education Energy Tuesday, May 23, 2017 Insider K Street Lifestyle Opinion Politics Religion Sports Voting Laws Culture Health Immigration Technology Economy Education Energy Home Headline The March on Gun Shops Double Standard Headline Opinion The March on Gun Shops Double Standard By Lenny McAllister - 4:21pm June 12, 2012 986 2 SHARE Facebook Twitter The proposed “marches on gun shops” to bring attention to Chicago’s spike in violence could lead to an unlikely destination and thus an unnecessary conundrum for Black leaders. Recently, there have been a lot of tweets and scuttlebutt out there concerning a proposed organized effort (led by the Rev. Jesse Jackson, Sr.) to protest gun shops around the nation in protest to the recent violence seen in cities such as Chicago. Odd, considering that legal gun ownership in the city of Chicago was not viable until post-2010 by way of the McDonald v. Chicago Supreme Court case from a few years back. I commend Rev. Jackson for his years of service to America and the Black community. Those that have heard me on the air know that I don’t do the ugly names that get hurled at him and notable others. I also don’t attach over-generalizing motives to all of his actions. Just the same, I believe in the validity of the Second Amendment – although as a Pittsburgh native and a Chicago resident, I understand the debate over appropriate urban gun oversight. That said, I hope the Reverend doesn’t get into a faux war with small business owners that happen to be gun shop owners. It would be akin to taking on all of the liquor stores in our communities in the hope that we can stem the tide of substance abuse and unhealthiness in Black America. How successful has that effort been? Of course, couple those efforts to close community liquor stores with us watching the most successful grocery chains in our communities sell alcohol to us 40- ounces at a time from aisles sitting right beside the frozen juices, distilled water and frozen vegetables. We don’t say much about that contradiction. A symbolic boycott of the gun shops will likely be as effective as the Congressional Black Caucus grilling Attorney General Eric Holder over the recent spike in shootings in Chicago, including the beloved South Side communities. Reaching for low-hanging fruit solutions to address the youth violence decimating our communities (such as probing the Department of Justice for possible – and unnecessary – big government involvement or taking on small business owners over decades-long challenges) does nothing for the high-wind drama that we collectively continue to catch. Black leaders apply double standards and inconsistent methodologies to our issues – namely, protesting those that are outside of our circles of friends and influence while condoning the dysfunction ongoing within our comfort zones of confidants.  As long as they do that, we will continue to capture attention in the media, yet continue failing to capture any long-lasting solutions. If easy gun accessibility is an issue that we must immediately address through marches and protests of small business owners, are we willing to take on one of the most successful gun retailers in the nation? Wal-Mart proudly sells firearms in roughly half of their 3,600 stores nationally, so it would interesting to see if Black leaders challenge a business that has given back to Black communities through initiatives such as the Thurgood Marshal College Fund. The same could be said for other huge corporations that fund Black initiatives and support Black leaders, leading to silence from our communities when confronting small and large conflicts of mission, action, and integrity with these organizations. Of course, the fight for the moral right should have no price tag – or does it? The timetable for Black America’s resurgence from youth violence, substance abuse issues, education failure, and mass incarceration does not have the social or political bandwidth to tolerate inconsistencies in approach or accountability. Further, it does not have the wiggle room to continue the selective blame games for bigger problems (such as blaming “fractured gangs” for a spike in violence as if established gangs do not bring their own brand of terror to our neighborhoods) or continue selectivity on partnership to resolve the issues. I do understand the cost of taking on such a position, both personally and professionally. Yet, it is ever clear that the value of fighting to uphold the moral right and reverse civic decay should always hold more worth than the cost of losing temporary battles or healing the scars incurred in the process. If we are going to take a stand on issues, the value of our principle must always exceed the cost of our corporate partnerships. Understanding the moral and civic right to resurrect our troubled neighborhoods should enable us to effectively and collaboratively negotiate approaches that solve our challenges and satisfy our corporate partnerships with a consistent standard for our children. Anything less equates to taking on issues for the taste of activism without seeing the fulfillment of substance in our actions. Picking on the little guy over our community’s challenges when there are bigger fish to fry is doing nothing more than continuing a big lie in our communities. Namely, it has now become more fashionable and comfortable to be busy when it comes to addressing our communities’ issues than it is for us to be historic in actually resolving them.  We must discard some double standards in our communities and elevate a new standard moving forward.

Allen 8:37pm June 12, 2012 at 8:37 pm Dealing with the gun shops is partly an issue when thousands of guns with serial numbers from Chick's Gun Shop end up in so many of the Chicago shootings, but this STILL does not deal with the overwhelming issue that the frenzy in streets are a FREE-FOR-ALL from those battling over illegal street economies and will to risk and take lives over these desperate economic conditions that also are NOT driven by our easy media target of established street gangs. You deal with a desperate economic problem with a desperate economic solution. Put these communities back to work. and away from battling to survive over illegal street economies. No economic solution. No real answer to stopping the violence. Stop The ECONOMIC VIOLENCE by returning to the spirit and example of Black Wall Street. Reply scholarshiptag 9:21am May 22, 2017 at 9:21 am I still don’t understand why the use of Guns are Gun shop are legalized in America, because this legalization have been in existence for a very long time, it has now become a very difficult law to rule out. Although if the law could be rules out properly, or earlier than now, there wouldn’t have been any violence. But the deed has already been done of which the masses are to suffer for its circumstances. Thank for countries like Nigeria, they don’t licence the use of arms for the citizens except for those politicians who intend to arm their-selves due to political opponent issues.

Besides, losses at its Chinese subsidiary Guangdong Symphony Keruilai Air Coolers (GSK) have also been halved. As such, revenues from overseas markets were Rs 171.16 crore for FY17, up 39 per cent. ICICI Securities expects export volumes for Symphony to grow at 27 per cent CAGR between FY15 ti FY19, while the domestic volumes would grow at 19 per cent CAGR from FY17 to FY19. Impco clocked a turnover of Rs 87 crore in FY17 and its profit after tax was around Rs 5-6 crore. While this is marginally less than the previous year, sources in the company said that the 2015-16 figures included proceeds from sale of non-core assets. The turnaround in a true sense has thus been achieved this year, the source added. Impco's performance during 2015-16 was hit by a delayed summer, which led to a decline in sales. In addition, political disturbance in some exporting countries affected overall volume offtake. As a result, even service centre sales got affected to some extent. ICICI Securities, expected that the margin profile of Impco is expected to increase further on the back of Symphony's strategy to make Impco an asset light company. Achal Bakeri, chairman and managing director of Symphony Ltd explained, "We initiated Project Renovaccion to transpose Symphony's asset-light and capital-light business model (product outsourcing, divested surplus land,buildings, plants, business relocated). This helped to unlock resources. Loans and advances granted by Symphony India and its Singapore-based subsidiary have been completely repaid with interest, making Impco self-sufficient. The business has since been turned around with a decent cash profit and moderate profit after tax." Currently, Impco contributes around 18 per cent to the consolidated topline with a major chunk of revenues (65 per cent of overall sales) coming from centralised and heavy-duty air coolers and the remaining (around 35 per cent of sales) from room coolers. At present, the company serves markets like the US, India, Iraq and some of the Middle East countries. The ICICI Securities report points out that Symphony started leveraging the enduring relationships established by Impco with large format stores like Wal-Mart, Sears, Home Depot, Lowes, Famsa and Costco, among others, to widen its presence in North, South and Central America. Bakeri said that the Impco acquisition not only gave Symphony access to the North American markets, but also entry into an industrial or centralised air coolers segment in which prior to Impco acquisition, Symphony was not present at all. The company has created a separate business vertical as 'centralised air cooling systems' which is growing rapidly in India, Bakeri informed. Symphony is the first in India's organised sector to launch industrial air coolers. ICICI Securities report said, "The company has executed orders for some renowned brands namely Asian Paints, DHL, Dixon Technologies, Swaminarayan Temple, Iskcon Temple, Marico, Tractor India and Shivam Auto Tech (part of Hero Group). Symphony received its first order from Indian Railways to install air coolers in waiting rooms of Kota and Godhra railway stations." As for the GSK subsidiary in China (with a turnover of around Rs 51 crore in FY17), the losses have have been halved. Bakeri said when it had acquired GSK in January 2016, they had factored that the business would lose money for the next few years. "We moderated operating losses in 2016-17; we expect the business to turn cash- positive across the foreseeable future (in line with with the estimate at the time of acquisition)." On the domestic front, Symphony plans deeper penetration and grow its dealer network to 40,000 dealers. It is currently the market leader with a 50 per cent market share. Currently, the air cooler industry is largely dominated by the unorganised segment(around 70-80 per cent volume market share). The company invested Rs 41 crore in brand building in 2016-17. This was 32 per cent higher than the previous year 2015-16 figure. It launched a TVC 'Garmi ko karo Symphony!'. The domestic air cooler industry is estimated to grow at around 21 per cent CAGR between FY15-FY25.

The closely held company, which operates about 10,000 stores across Europe, is preparing to open 20 locations in North Carolina, Virginia and South Carolina starting on June 15. Lidl, known as an efficient operator that focuses on lower-priced, private-label products, plans to have as many as 100 stores on the East Coast by the summer of 2018 and is also looking at sites in Ohio and Texas. Lidl is expected to add competitive pressure to a grocery industry embroiled in a price war that has been fueled by a record streak of food deflation. Wal-Mart Stores Inc., which generates more than half its revenue from the grocery business, has been cutting prices in a bid to keep its low-cost edge. Aldi, a longtime Lidl competitor is Europe, is also getting ready: the company is spending $1.6 billion (Dh5.8 billion) to upgrade 1,300 of its US stores. Lidl, meanwhile, hopes to emulate its European operations in the US. The German chain, along with Aldi, has had success entering new markets across the continent, and sees its private-label products resonating with US consumers, many of whom aren’t likely familiar with the brand. “It’s not the first time we are doing this,” said Lidl executive Boudewijn Tiktak, referring to the company’s expansion into the US. “It’s what we do.” More from Retail UAE sin tax spells trouble for Swiss cigar maker Dubai’s secondary malls ‘to face pressure’ Selling gold without the bazaar mentality For Roseberry, supermarkets in UAE make sense UAE retailers cannot ignore click-and-collect US fast food workers are hot property Amazon good to go with grocery store in UK German grocery giant muscles into the US tags from this storyUnited States follow this tag on MGN filed underGulfNewsBusinessSectorsRetail tagsUnited States follow this tag on MGN+ MGN Also In RetailUAE sin tax spells trouble for Swiss cigar maker Business Gallery Doors open to a three-day super sale Mohammad launches Marsa Al Arab project Business Videos PlayAbu Dhabi Ship Building enjoys growing success Strata UAE leads aerospace manufacturing FOLLOW US Most Popular ViewedCommentedVideosPictures 01Dubai’s secondary malls ‘to face pressure’ 02Dubai's 3-day Super Sale starts today 03Malls in Dubai have wind in their sales again Play Abu Dhabi Ship Building enjoys growing success Nov 24, 2016 Play Strata UAE leads aerospace manufacturing Oct 25, 2016 Play Emirati who created 2 successful companies Jan 02, 2016 Play Dragon Mart has latest and cheapest iPads Mar 03, 2011 13Images Mohammad launches Marsa Al Arab project May 15, 2017 1Image Pictures: Apple Store at Mall of the Emirates Oct 27, 2015 8Images Massive development at Abu Dhabi airport Mar 11, 2017 8Images Pictures: Apple Store in Abu Dhabi Oct 27, 2015 Currency Converter first-currency currencyAEDDinarRupee= first-currency currencyINRDinarRupee Most Popular on Gulf News Ramadan school timings announced When can the UAE expect Ramadan?
