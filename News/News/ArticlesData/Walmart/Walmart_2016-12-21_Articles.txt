Orders have been placed by over 300 growers supplying Walmart with a variety of fresh produce items. “Walmart chooses to use Wood Grain RPCs to deliver produce for a variety of reasons,” said Shawn Baldwin, SVP Produce, Floral, Global Food Sourcing, Walmart USA. “They have better ventilation, they’re ergonomically designed and very easy to use. And, our customers really like the new Wood Grain RPCs because they look more like a farmers market or roadside fruit stand which provides a level of comfort during the shopping experience.” “We are proud to partner with Walmart and its fresh produce suppliers to provide them with innovative, efficient, cost-effective and sustainable reusable packaging that transitions easily to in-store display,” said Daniel Walsh, President of IFCO North America. “Surpassing the 11 million Wood Grain RPC threshold so quickly is an impressive accomplishment made possible through strong collaboration between Walmart, the grower community and IFCO.” IFCO Wood Grain RPCs are used to ship fresh produce to Walmart under an agreement reached with the world’s largest retailer in October, 2015. The RPCs were designed to Walmart specifications and incorporated feedback received from the grower community. Like all IFCO RPCs, the Wood Grain RPCs are more efficient, protect and cool product better and are more environmentally sustainable than one-way packaging. IFCO has a strong commitment to supporting local economies, local companies and local workers in the marketplaces where it does business whenever possible. In the United States, IFCO’s Wood Grain RPCs are 100% sourced and manufactured in America and meet the Federal Trade Commission’s standard for its “Made in the USA” country of origin label. In addition, IFCO Wood Grain RPCs are cleaned and sanitized at one of six US service centers throughout their life cycle. Discussion Be the first to comment on this article!

Brent Wilmot helps 11-year-old Claremont Middle School student Lacey Laroche look for a gift for a family member Tuesday during the police department's "Shop With a Cop" program at Walmart. — CAMERON PAQUETTECLAREMONT — Area police were out in force at Walmart for all the right reasons Tuesday night as they helped upward of 60 area children find and purchase Christmas gifts for their loved ones. For the first time in eight years, the Claremont Police Department have brought back the department’s “Shop With a Cop” program, which allows less fortunate elementary school students to purchase gifts for the family with the assistance of a local police officer while their parents wait at the front of the store. Student Resource Officer Crystal Simonds and Claremont Police Lt. Stan Andrews put their heads together to re-launch the program after it had ceased eight years ago due to funding issues. “It’s something we used to do every single year,” said Simonds, who has worked with the police department for 18 years. The Windsor Police Department was also on hand at Walmart Tuesday night for that department’s 2nd annual Shop With a Cop. Windsor Police Chief William Sampson said the event is a good opportunity for kids who might find themselves in a less-than-fortunate position in the holidays. “We look at families that are having a tough time,” he said. “We try to target those kids to let them buy something they may not have.” He said that last year’s event was funded through the police department, but that this year the money raised for the event was “100 percent donated” Windsor Police Det. Jennifer Frank reaches up to high-five 6-year-old Elijah Barett at Walmart during the police department's 2nd annual "Shop With a Cop" night Tuesday. — CAMERON PAQUETTESimonds said she had been trying to re-launch the program since she became student resource officer for Claremont schools three years ago, and that “this year it all just fell together.” She said 65 children in Claremont schools received invitations. Each student was assisted by a Claremont officer while they conducted their shopping at Walmart in Claremont. She said that between a $1,000 Walmart community involvement grant and donations from various charities, including the Claremont Police Association, $4,000 was raised for the children to spend. Guidance counselors in the elementary schools were asked to invite students who they thought “might need a positive moment” this holiday season, according to Simonds. She said that the number of students invited depends on the amount of money raised. “When I met with some of the families and game them invites, it was emotionally overwhelming” to see how thankful they were to be able to buy for their family members, Simonds said. With about 12 officers from Claremont, Cornish and the sheriff’s department on hand, roughly five students accompanied officers into the store to shop every 15 minutes. After cashing out at the register, each student was given a gift bag with a Walmart gift card, fruit snacks, candy canes and other holiday goodies. Simonds said that with all the “bad news” regarding police on a national level, the event is a good way to foster positive relationships between the police and the community. “It’s such  great opportunity for the kids to create a positive relationship with the the police,” she said. Lori Carrier, who brought her son, 9-year-old Disnard Elementary School student Kaden, agreed. “This is a good program for [Kaden] to have a positive experience with police,” she said.

Sayre THE BLADE Buy This Image Share Tweet Share Email Comments Print More than three dozen families this month had their holiday wishes saved at the last minute thanks to a generous donation made possible by a man who knows what it’s like to be teetering on the brink. Blessings in Disguise, a small nonprofit founded by local businessman John Sayre, paid off 39 layaway accounts at two Toledo-area Walmart stores on Dec. 12.  That date was the last day Walmart customers had to make final payments on their layaway items or have those items returned to the stores’ shelves. “A lot of people are too prideful to ask [for help.] They don’t like to tell you when they’re down and out,” Mr. Sayre said.  “An easy way for me to tell the last couple years people are struggling is when they put things on layaway, and it’s the last day, and they’re not paid off,” he said. The group declined to say how much was spent, but it was several thousand dollars, and the organization targeted layaway accounts with children’s items. Every year around Christmastime, stories pop up nationwide of kind strangers who have paid off others’ bills. Last December, Wal-Mart said an anonymous donor visited stores in Cleveland and Lorain and spent $106,000 to pay off others’ bills. This year, an anonymous donor paid off nearly $50,000 at a Walmart in Pennsylvania. Another donor spent $5,000 at a store in southwest Ohio. “When customers quietly pay off others’ layaway items, we’re reminded how good people can be,” the company said in a statement. “The joy that comes from these transactions extends well beyond dollars and cents. We’re honored to be a small part of these random acts of kindness.” In the case of Mr. Sayre, he’s making good on a promise he made to himself years ago. After a swindling venture capital fund drained his bank accounts, Mr. Sayre found himself penniless but unable to find much help because, on paper, he made too much money. He vowed that when he was able, he would start a nonprofit aimed at helping people who didn’t qualify for government assistance but nevertheless needed help. Blessings in Disguise, which received its 501(c)3 status in 2014, is targeted at northwest Ohio individuals who make more than $24,500 and families making more than $42,500, who are receiving unemployment compensation, workers’ compensation, or short-term disability, but no government benefits. “I was in their shoes. I fit that profile, and I couldn’t get assistance,” Mr. Sayre said. “So I vowed one day that when I could I would create the plan and the vision to create that group that would help them. And that’s really how the mission started.” Though the organization usually does in-depth screening of everyone it helps, it broadens its reach at Christmas. At Walmart, the group took any unpaid layaway in which 95 percent of the items are clearly for children. “We try to focus on the kids, because that’s what it’s about,” he said. Though Wal-Mart officials didn’t know of any other similar acts in the Toledo area, employees at two area Kmart stores reported several instances in which someone offered to anonymously pay off a layaway tab. Samantha Nicholson, the layaway manager at Kmart on Alexis Road, said one customer noticed a pile of items, including many toys, that were destined to go back on the store shelves because the amount still owed hadn’t been paid on time. When the customer learned the items had been on layaway but weren’t paid in full, she asked if she could pay the tab herself. “I pulled from the list of people who made partial payments or some payments but couldn’t make them all, and she paid on three of them,” Ms. Nicholson said. Officials at both stores said about five people had offered to pay this year. “It’s very emotional,” Ms. Nicholson said. Contact Tyrel Linkhorn at tlinkhorn@theblade.com or 419-724-6134.

(cleveland.com file photo) Print Email Cliff Pinckard, cleveland.com By Cliff Pinckard, cleveland.com The Plain Dealer Email the author | Follow on Twitter on December 21, 2016 at 4:21 AM, updated December 21, 2016 at 4:53 AM comments ITHACA, New York -- A man accused of killing a UPS driver outside a Walmart earlier this month said during a court appearance that he believes he killed president-elect Donald Trump, reports say. Police say Justin Barkley, 38, of Dryden, N.Y., shot and killed William Schumacher, 52, of Candor, N.Y., on Dec. 8. in a Walmart parking lot, then ran over Schumacher with his vehicle. He later fired at police officers and was arrested after an eight-hour standoff at his home. According to the Ithaca Voice, Barkley said during his court appearance that he staked out the Walmart because he knew Trump would be there. "I shot and killed Donald Trump purposely, intentionally and very proudly," Barkley said, according to the Voice. "I went there to purposely shoot and kill him and put him down." Barkley reportedly said he could not be convinced that he had not killed anyone other than Trump. Barkley attempted to plead guilty to second-degree murder and menacing a police officer or peace officer, but Tompkins County Court Judge John Rowley rejected the plea, instead ordering Barkley be evaluated to determine whether he is competent to stand trial, the Ithaca Journal reports. Barkley's next court appearance is scheduled for Jan. 6. According to the Journal, Schumacher was a seasonal UPS driver who had stopped at the Walmart to get something to eat during his overnight shift. Schumacher was shot at about 1 a.m. Barkley is a former social worker at St. Lawrence Psychiatric Center and also worked at the Office of Children and Family Services' Finger Lakes Residential Center, North Country Now reports. He was not employed at either facility at the time of the shooting. If you would like to comment on this story, please visit cleveland.com's crime and courts comments section.

However, while Walmart did heed to that particular request, it refused to remove other “Black Lives Matter” clothing, a demand that was put forth by FOP President Chuck Canterbury in his letter sent to Walmart on Tuesday. "Black Lives Matter” is a slogan and an international protest movement that began after the death of Trayvon Martin. It campaigns against violence and systemic racism toward black people. The movement is considered to target law enforcement and has inspired a counter pro-police movement called “Blue Lives Matter. The pulled off clothing say “Bulletproof” with “Black Lives Matter” beneath that line. In an article titled “Walmart Selling Black Lives Matter Shirts with ‘Bulletproof’ on Them” posted last week, Breitbart.com, the news organization known for its far-right views, directed attention toward Walmart and characterized the “Black Lives Matter” movement as a “hate or terrorist effort.” It also incorrectly stated that the "questionable" merchandise was being sold by Walmart when in fact it was being sold on Walmart’s website by Old Glory Merchandise, a Connecticut-based music and entertainment apparel dealer. In his letter addressed to Walmart CEO C. Douglas McMill, Canterbury advised the former to refrain from was selling “offensive shirts and sweatshirts.” Canterbury also accused the "third party" of  “profiting from racial division." “I urge you to prohibit the use of the Walmart name and website for the retail sale of these products,” read the letter. Related Stories Trump Plans African-American Issues Meeting Black Lives Matter 'Indebted' To Fidel Castro Canterbury added: “I am concerned that allowing these articles to be sold in this way will damage your company’s good name amongst FOP members and other active and retired law enforcement officers…Commercializing our differences will not help our local police and communities to build greater trust and respect for one another.” In response, Walmart issued a statement Tuesday night, according to Washington Post, that said: “Like other online retailers, we have a marketplace with millions of items offered by third parties that includes Blue Lives Matter, Black Lives Matter, and All Lives Matter merchandise. After hearing concerns from customers, we are removing the specific item with the ‘bulletproof’ reference.” Walmart has had a history of controversies regarding the sale of items and for pulling items off their shelves. For instance, back in 2006, the company was forced to reverse its policy and stock emergency contraception pills in all of its pharmacies after losing a lawsuit filed in a Massachusetts court. Another incident in 2006 that caused embarrassment to Walmart involved their retail website, which linked four films about iconic African Americans to "Planet of the Apes" and "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory" through their customer recommendation system . Walmart dodged the bullet and shrugged off the criticism that called their web site racist by claiming that it was due to human error.

Harris Courtney Bissinge looks for items on the shelf while shopping at Wal-Mart as her daughter, Ember, rests in a new Caroline’s Cart, a shopping cart for special needs children, on Tuesday in Pendleton. Buy this photo The new shopping cart carrying 3-year-old Ember glided through the aisles. Mother Courtney Bissinger hadn’t found grocery shopping at the Pendleton Wal-Mart so easy in a while. Ember has seeing and hearing problems, cerebral palsy and severe neurological damage. Bissinger, 31, a Pendleton native, said pushing her daughter in a wheelchair and maneuvering a grocery cart at the same time made shopping a pain. “Not everybody has the luxury of an extra set of hands or a caregiver,” she said. “I needed something that would let me shop more than her wheelchair.” Ember’s wheelchair can accommodate only a small basket, and she is getting too big for the seat that fits into regular shopping carts. The solution was Caroline’s Cart, a shopping cart for special needs children. The six-wheeled cart has a rear-facing seat with a harness that can secure a person weighing up to 250 pounds, according to manufacturer information, while the basket is almost the size of a regular shopping cart. Bissinger said she found out about the helpful carts from friends on social media who alert her to contraptions that could make life easier for her and Ember. She shops at Wal-Mart, so several weeks ago she asked the company about getting some of the carts for the Pendleton store. Shawna Nulf has 23 years with Wal-Mart, the last five as manager of the Pendleton store. She took information from Bissinger and called the “home office” about the carts. Sure enough, the retail giant had them, and she ordered two. Nulf said she was concerned they would not arrive until after the holiday shopping season. The carts came Tuesday. “I rushed them up front,” she said. And Bissinger and Ember went shopping at noon. Nulf said the corporate motto is “Happy to help,” and the new carts meet a need in the store. Bissinger said she knows several families in Pendleton and Umatilla County could use these carts. Nulf added she would bring in more if the need increased. She said seeing Ember in the cart was good. Ember’s needs stem from congenital cytomegalovirus, or CMV. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CMV is a common virus affecting people of all ages. Once you have CMV, you always have CMV, and more than half the population over 40 has the virus. Most people with CMV show no signs or symptoms, but the virus can cause serious health problems for people with weakened immune systems and for developing babies in the womb. “I got a cold in the first couple of months of pregnancy,” Bissinger said. “It turns out it was way more than that.” Bissinger said her daughter obviously suffered from something, and local doctors did not know what. Six months after Ember was born, Bissinger said, a doctor in Portland made the diagnosis. Congenital CMV infection can cause a range of symptoms, including some worse than Ember’s. Bissinger said her daughter can express herself, enjoys the stimulation of being in public and, like any young child, can get into any mess she finds. “I consider myself lucky that she can interact and have the ability to be a wild child,” she said. She also said she hoped people would respect the new carts. Life is difficult enough, she said, and even small comforts help.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obituaries E-Edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive log in weather Brockton man charged in Walmart thefts in Raynham Wednesday Dec 21, 2016 at 12:01 AM Dec 21, 2016 at 8:18 AM Sara Cline @saraclinenews RAYNHAM — The Raynham Police Department took to Twitter requesting help from the public in identifying the man who allegedly stole $2,530 worth of merchandise from Walmart — and now they have a warrant for his arrest. Raynham Police are searching for John Knapp, 37, of Brockton, whom they say stole over $2,530 worth of merchandise from the Walmart located at 36 Paramount Drive, in four separate incidents since September. Police Tweeted nine surveillance photos of the suspects stealing items from the Walmart. The Tweets were retweeted and shared by other accounts such as the Taunton Police Department. By Dec. 13, the police station received calls identifying Knapp as one of the men in the surveillance photos, Raynham Police Lieutenant David LaPlante said. Police are now actively searching for Knapp, whose last address is unknown, according to police. LaPlante said that Knapp has an arrest warrant for four counts of larceny that took place between Sept. 7 and Dec. 11 at the Walmart, which is open 24/7. According to police reports the first incident was Sept. 7 around 11 p.m., when they say Knapp and another man entered the Walmart store, went into the Garden and Lawn Center and loaded a cart with various lawn equipment, that amounted to $804 total, and then left through the garden center doors. The second incident occurred Oct. 28 around 2 a.m., when again police say Knapp and another man returned to the Garden and Lawn Center, this time stealing hand-held leaf blowers worth $234, according to LaPlante. The third and most expensive incident took place Dec. 9 at 12:45 a.m., when police say Knapp and another man stole two snow blowers, worth $597 each. LaPlante said in these three incidents, the men forced open the locked doors of the garden center, which led outside of the building, loaded the stolen equipment into a truck and drove away. LaPlante said in the third incident, the truck was described as a dark, two-door, pickup truck. It is unclear whether the second man with Knapp in these three incidents is the same person. Police say Knapp returned to the store on Dec. 11 at 3:21 a.m., but this time there was no second man on surveillance camera. LaPlante said Knapp could be seen on surveillance camera going into the garden center stealing a walk-behind lawn mower and loading it into a dark colored sedan, possibly a Nissan, LaPlante said. Police are actively searching for Knapp and further suspects have not yet been identified, LaPlante said. Knapp could be facing charges for fours counts of larceny, including three counts of larceny over $250 and one count of larceny under $250. This is an active investigation and anyone with further information about the thefts is asked to call Raynham Police at 508-824-2717.

And yet participants weren’t quite ready to sign up for any sky-is-falling thesis. “It would be better, for sure, if the Trump administration weren’t obstructionist,” said Nature Conservancy CEO Mark Tercek at the NationSwell Summit. “But we’re not doomed if that’s the case,” he continued. Why? Because giant multinational companies are now advancing sustainability agendas rooted in bottom-line concerns. Tercek took a moment to compliment not an obvious ecological champion like, say, Apple, but a corporation that hasn’t always been seen as green: “Walmart is being enormously constructive.” Not a crazy idea The idea of turning one’s environmental attention from an uninterested or unmotivated White House and instead looking to large firms with a nationwide or international scale isn’t new. Walmart (WMT) pleasantly surprised many activists during the George W. Bush administration. In 2005, then-CEO Lee Scott said that Hurricane Katrina had changed his thinking and committed the firm long-term to using 100% renewable energy, creating zero waste, and selling only sustainable products. Lee’s speech noted the underlying financial logic of these moves: “If our trucks are inefficient from a fuel standpoint, we’ll pay for that at the diesel pump.” Making Walmart’s fleet of trucks more efficient by one mile per gallon would have saved $52 million that year. Lee Scott speaking at the Fortune Brainstorm Green conference in April 2010. Source: REUTERS/Lucy NicholsonMore A 2008 report in the Stanford Social Innovation Review found that these initiatives, often done in concert with nonprofits like the Green Electronics Council and the World Wildlife Fund, both shrank Walmart’s environmental footprint and expanded its profits by chipping away at waste in its operations and those of its suppliers. Eight years later, Walmart’s 2016 “Global Responsibility Report” notes substantial progress. The company met its goal of doubling the efficiency of its US fleet by 2015, which saved 650,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide—and nearly $1 billion in expenses. (The report notes that much of this improvement was due to automated monitoring of truck drivers’ performance on the road and the resulting “well-informed conversations” management can have with them.) Walmart has yet to hit 100% renewable energy, but by reaching 25% it’s climbed well above the 9.4% average for the US in August. In November, the company said it aims to get to 50% renewable by 2025. “The things that I talked about today will be good business as well as doing good things for the world ,” Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said at a conference after announcing that and other sustainability goals. The phrase “greed is good” doesn’t appear in that 2016 Walmart document or the Stanford report, but that line from the movie “Wall Street” does apply in this case. As another NationSwell Summit speaker, Energy Independence Now executive director Brian Goldstein, said: “It’s not, ‘hey, we want to save baby seals,’ but ‘this is going to make economic sense’.” Case study: cable boxes But what about situations where the company causing the waste doesn’t have to pay for it? That was the scenario with cable boxes, which not only cost you $10 or more a month in rental fees but also have historically been energy hogs. The Natural Resources Defense Council studied the problem and found that cable and satellite boxes ate up 27 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity, more than $3 billion worth, in 2010. That consumption could be cut by 30% to 50%, that nonprofit’s research found. Read More That led to a voluntary agreement to reduce TV-box energy consumption signed in late 2013 by NRDC, the Department of Energy, cable and satellite operators, set-box manufacturers and two industry groups, the Consumer Electronics Association (now the Consumer Technology Association) and the National Cable & Telecommunications Association (now NCTA – the Internet & Television Association). Three years later, that deal seems to be working. An August 2016 study found that TV-box energy use had declined by 15.9% overall, with energy use by digital video recorders—the most power-intensive kind—dropping by 36%. That initiative also led to a 2015 agreement to increase the efficiency of routers, cable modems and other home network equipment. An audit a year later found that 89.6% of the hardware models covered by this deal met its efficiency standards — though you could say that meant those goals weren’t ambitious enough. Noah Horowitz, who directs the NRDC’s Center for Energy Efficiency, credited public pressure and the cable industry’s fear of more bad PR. “This collective pressure caused the service providers and their suppliers to focus on driving down the energy use of new and existing set top boxes,” he wrote in an e-mail, noting that President Barack Obama’s administration wasn’t crucial to that success: “Under a different White House we would have likely achieved a similar outcome.” Horowitz noted that having only a few manufacturers of TV boxes made a corporate-focused strategy work. This market also allowed for a quick payback: “We were able to achieve immediate energy savings, rather than wait five plus years for a national standard to take effect.” Change is still hard Protesters in Berlin after the election of Donald Trump. Source: Sean Gallup/Getty ImagesMore It’s still important to note that Trump White House looks like to be much more hostile to energy regulations than prior administrations. Trump appointed a vocal climate-change denier, Competitive Enterprise Institute official Myron Ebell, to run the transition at the Environmental Protection Agency. And finding corporate champions will only go so far to counteract that. Besides, many attempts to push change at the corporate level still fail. The shareholder-activist group Ceres expects a record number of shareholder resolutions on climate change in 2017—200 or so, up from 174 in 2016. But a look at its list of shareholder resolutions shows that most failed, the usual fate of resolutions not backed by management. And many environmental problems—think of the long-standing problem of Chesapeake Bay pollution — result from the actions of a large group of smaller actors. That’s the sort of situation where a regulation or a tax, as ugly as it may be to those affected directly, is more effective than lobbying corporations directly. And Washington seems to have lost its appetite for those measures, at least for the next four years.

Hong Walmart to stop selling 'Bulletproof: Black Lives Matter' shirts after police protest By Tom Jackman • Washington Post Dec 21, 2016 (…) AP Photo/Jae C. Hong Updated at 12:38 p.m. The president of the national Fraternal Order of Police, the country's largest police organization, on Tuesday asked Walmart to stop selling T-shirts and sweatshirts which say "Black Lives Matter" and "Bulletproof" on the department store's website. On Tuesday night, Walmart said it would remove the shirts which say "Bulletproof," but not the "Black Lives Matter" shirts. "Black Lives Matter" is a slogan and protest movement which emerged after the death of Trayvon Martin in 2012 and police-involved slayings in 2014, and is seen as offensive by many in law enforcement. The website Breitbart.com posted an article last week which said that Walmart was "selling Black Lives Matter clothing and other items," though the merchandise is actually being sold through Walmart's website by Old Glory Merchandise, a music and entertainment apparel dealer out of Connecticut. Chuck Canterbury, the FOP president, wrote to Walmart CEO C. Douglas McMillon Tuesday to advise him that the Walmart website was selling "offensive shirts and sweatshirts," and "I urge you to prohibit the use of the Walmart name and website for the retail sale of these products." The Walmart site and Old Glory's site also sell "Blue Lives Matter" shirts. Canterbury said he understood that a third party was selling the merchandise, but "I am concerned that allowing these articles to be sold in this way will damage your company's good name amongst FOP members and other active and retired law enforcement officers." Canterbury added, "Commercializing our differences will not help our local police and communities to build greater trust and respect for one another." "Like other online retailers, we have a marketplace with millions of items offered by third parties that includes Blue Lives Matter, Black Lives Matter and All Lives Matter merchandise," Walmart said in a statement late Tuesday. "After hearing concerns from customers, we are removing the specific item with the 'bulletproof' reference." The "bulletproof" shirts say "Bulletproof" with "Black Lives Matter" beneath that line. Old Glory did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Jim Pasco, the executive director of the police union in Washington, said the issue was raised by union members who felt Walmart was selling anti-police items. "There are a lot of people who feel too many guns are sold," Pasco said. "Why not speak out against things that might be seen as fomenting violence, rather than things that commit violence?" _____________________ Our earlier story, posted at 2 a.m. Wednesday.

Chuck Canterbury, the FOP president, wrote to Walmart CEO C. Douglas McMillon Tuesday to advise him that the Walmart website was selling "offensive shirts and sweatshirts," and "I urge you to prohibit the use of the Walmart name and website for the retail sale of these products." The Walmart site and Old Glory's site also sell "Blue Lives Matter" shirts. Canterbury said he understood that a third party was selling the merchandise, but "I am concerned that allowing these articles to be sold in this way will damage your company's good name amongst FOP members and other active and retired law enforcement officers." Canterbury added, "Commercializing our differences will not help our local police and communities to build greater trust and respect for one another." Walmart and Old Glory did not respond to requests for comment Tuesday evening. Jim Pasco, the executive director of the police union in Washington, D.C., said the issue was raised by union members who felt Walmart was selling anti-police items. "There are a lot of people who feel too many guns are sold," Pasco said. "Why not speak out against things that might be seen as fomenting violence, rather than things that commit violence?"

Justin Barkley, 38, from Ithaca claimed he knew where the president-elect would be on December 8. He told the judge he then waited outside of the store where he shot a man he believed to be the billionaire - however he actually fired at 52-year-old William Schumacher. 'I shot and killed Donald Trump purposely, intentionally and very proudly,' Barkley said during his arraignment on Monday, according to the Ithaca Voice. Justin Barkley, 38, (left) is accused of of killing UPS driver William Schumacher, 52, (right) in Ithaca, New York. Barkley told a judge he killed Donald Trump during a court appearance  Police engaged Barkley in an eight-hour standoff before they arrested him after shooting Schumacher and firing at other officers. Barkley was indicted for second-degree murder and menacing a police officer. In a court hearing that appeared to make very little sense at times, Barkley told Judge John Rowley that 'he recognized the difference between mistaking a person for Trump and saying that he killed him.'

Judge Rowley refused to allow Barkley to enter a guilty plea stating that Barkley needed to be examined by psychiatrists to determine whether he is even capable of standing trial. That would last until February. next year. The judge said that he felt 'uncomfortable' taking Barkley's plea without having undergone psychiatric examinations first. The assessment could take place at either a mental hospital or at the jail itself.  If he does eventually stand trial and is convicted, Barkley faces 25 years to life in prison.

In the letter from Chuck Canterbury, the FOP president,to Walmart CEO C. Douglas McMillon, Canterbury said the Walmart website was selling 'offensive shirts and sweatshirts,' and urged him 'to prohibit the use of the Walmart name and website for the retail sale of these products.' The 'Black Lives Matter' protest movement emerged following the death of Trayvon Martin in 2012 and gained ground after several high-profile deaths at the hands of police 'I am concerned that allowing these articles to be sold in this way will damage your company's good name amongst FOP members and other active and retired law enforcement officers,' he continued.  Canterbury added: 'Commercializing our differences will not help our local police and communities to build greater trust and respect for one another.' In a statement, Walmart said: 'Like other online retailers, we have a marketplace with millions of items offered by third parties that includes Blue Lives Matter, Black Lives Matter and All Lives Matter merchandise.  Some of the shirts carry the word 'Bulletproof' in large print with 'Black Lives Matter' written underneath The shirts are being sold by Old Glory Merchandise, a Connecticut-based music and entertainment apparel dealer RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Microsoft sparks controversy with holiday ad which promotes... Hundreds of protesters clash with riot police at Texas A&M... Share this article Share 'After hearing concerns from customers, we are removing the specific item with the "bulletproof" reference.'  The shirts carry the word 'Bulletproof' in large print with 'Black Lives Matter' written underneath. The shirts are being sold by Old Glory Merchandise, a Connecticut-based music and entertainment apparel dealer. After receiving the letter the retailer agreed to remove some Black Lives Matter shirts but most are still on sale Both Old Glory and Walmart's website also sell shirts with the pro-police slogan 'Blue Lives Matter'. Jim Pasco, the executive director of the police union in Washington, said union members had complained about the shirts because they felt Walmart was selling anti-police items.  'There are a lot of people who feel too many guns are sold,' Pasco told the Washington Post. 'Why not speak out against things that might be seen as fomenting violence, rather than things that commit violence?' The 'Black Lives Matter' protest movement emerged following the death of Trayvon Martin in 2012 and gained ground after several high-profile deaths at the hands of police. The 'Black Lives Matter' slogan is seen as offensive by many in law enforcement.  Read more: Walmart to stop selling ¿Bulletproof: Black Lives Matter¿ shirts after police protest - The Washington Post Share or comment on this article e-mail 91 shares Most watched News videos Dan Bilzerian show off glitzy lifestyle as 'King of Instagram' Blind man attaches GoPro to guide dog to record his commute Cyclist forced off the road by dangerous braking driver Heartbreaking moment horse cries at owner's funeral 'I thought he was going to hit me': Ann Widdecombe on Philpott Great White shark breaches the water in pursuit of a tasty treat "UFO" has been filmed demonstrating highly unusual behaviour Stepdaughter surprises stepmom with adoption papers at Christmas Meryl Streep arrives at Debbie Reynolds' and Carrie Fisher's memorial Dangling kid rescued from a ski lift at Whistler Mountain Police Video Shows Rescue Of Kidnapped Man Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds are buried together Pictured: The Fort Lauderdale 'air rage' gunman who 'argued...

The Bulletproof Black Lives Matter shirts were available from a vendor to the big box chain’s website. The national Fraternal Order of Police union demanded that Walmart remove the Bulletproof Black Lives Matter shirts after accusing the chain store of “profiting from racial division,” the New York Daily News reports. https://t.co/X750Ta0UFO Walmart got rid of the bulletproof blm shirts but not the rest of the #blm shirts @thebestcloser #closernation — Limpbizquick (@P90xbogie) December 21, 2016 While Walmart almost immediately removed the T-shirts and hoodies that said “BULLETPROOF” in large bold letters with “Black Lives Matter” written below it, the mega store chain has not announced any plans to discontinue the rest of its Black Lives Matter merchandise from its shelves. National Fraternal Order of Police President, Chuck Canterbury, wrote a letter to Walmart on Tuesday staunchly criticizing the store’s decision to sell the Bulletproof Black Lives Matter shirts. The shirts were offered on the chain’s website via a vendor named Old Glory Merchandise. The items pulled from Walmart are still available for sale on several websites, including Etsy and eBay, according to Law Officer. “At a time of year when we as a nation and indeed, as a world, should be coming together in hopes of peace on Earth and goodwill toward men, these third party sellers are profiting from racial division,” Canterbury said in the Walmart Black Lives Matter letter. “Commercializing our differences will not help our local police and communities to build greater trust and respect for one another. Turning a buck on strained relationships will not contribute to the healing process.” The police union leader also said he knows the request to pull the Black Lives Matter shirts will be “seriously considered” by Walmart officials. “I am concerned that allowing these articles to be sold in this way will damage your company’s good name among FOP members and other active and retired law enforcement officers,” Canterbury also said in the letter to Walmart. The Bulletproof shirts and hoodies were no longer available for purchase by the end of the same day. ‘Bulletproof: Black Lives Matter’ Clothing Pulled Off Walmart Shelves -about Time! @LadiesForTrump #BlueLivesMatter https://t.co/6gpaow5R6U — C M (@dahle44) December 21, 2016 If a customer clicks on the Bulletproof Black Lives Matter shirt or hoodie listing an error message now pops up. The message reads, “We’re having technical difficulties and are looking into the problem now.” The hoodies were reportedly selling for $36.95 each. Walmart has stated the Black Lives Matter Bulletproof shirts were being removed “after hearing complaints from customers.” Officials at the store did not address whether or not the rest of the Black Lives Matter apparel, gifts, or decor items would also be removed from their online marketplace. A quick search of the Walmart website reveals there are a plethora of “lives matter” apparel items and gear available for purchase. Customers can place items with “Black Lives Matter,” “Blue Lives Matter,” and “All Lives Matter,” slogans on them into a virtual cart and for purchase. Angst over the Bulletproof Black Lives Matter T-shirts and hoodies emerged after the Breitbart website ran an article about the items being sold last week. The Black Lives Matter (or BLM) movement and slogan began in 2012 after the death of black teenager Trayvon Martin in Florida, the Washington Post notes. Activists began appearing in several major cities around the United States after police-involved shootings of young black men. The Blue Lives Matter slogans and counter-protests emerged after controversial shootings in Ferguson and Baltimore prompted rioting and nationwide media coverage. What do you think about the Walmart Black Lives Matter shirts being offered for sale and then removed?

Walmart's holiday ad begins by reminding us of something we already know: Kids love Christmas. They can't sleep. They tear their presents open like wild animals. They scream.  Adults, on the other hand, are way less keen. Christmas is stressful. It's laborious. It's expensive. And it's a minefield of actively unfun corporate holiday parties. Then the ad ramps up. "At Walmart," it tells us, "we believe grownups should have a joyful Christmas too."  How's that? we wonder. Will you dim your abrasive lights? Will you make your aisles less cluttered? Will you, at the very least, give us a flashmob?  No. None of those things. Instead, Walmart is giving us Chris Jones, a hypnotist. In "Holiday Hypnosis," by Saatchi & Saatchi New York, Jones meets various harried adults and interviews them about their favorite childhood Christmases. Then, after placing them in a trance, he gets them to relive them.  Some of the results produce major lulz—it's a vision of adults wilding out in living rooms, tearing open presents, peering up the chimney for Santa, and beating the crap out of tiny drums. But there are also touching moments, like when a woman nudges a curtain open to discover snowfall, or an older man pantomimes the act of skating over the carpet.  And there's the giggling—that cup-runneth-over, tinkling-bell sound that tickles inside you and makes one guy keel over, clutching his tummy.  We're moved, despite ourselves. And when Jones snaps them back awake, it's as if they've returned from a faraway dream—still clutching wrapping paper, or on the floor, holding a very small drumstick. This isn't the time for debating the merits of hypnosis, or for whipping out that one time you tried it to quit smoking and it didn't work. Riding the emotions that unspool here requires a certain suspension of disbelief. There's something heartbreaking about letting an adult reinhabit her 5-year-old self, then taking that memory away in a dry finger-snap.  And we're not sure how to feel when Jones shows them the weird footage of all the things they did while under the spell. As grownups, there's something foolish and embarrassing about it, a sense of being tricked into losing the narrative grip of your life just long enough for it to be recorded. Scary thoughts can seep in: If I did that and didn't know it, what else could I do? But the subjects here laugh and cry.  "I never thought I'd see that again," the older man marvels, while a younger one laughs and says, "That's the young me!"  "It's been a while since I felt like this on Christmas," a woman adds, wiping tears away.  What keeps "Holiday Hypnosis" afloat is Jones' gentle, decisive manner. You feel like you can trust him to guide you safely through the alien. But what we're left with is a feather-light sense of what it felt like to be buoyed into the promise of the holidays without having to carry it on our own backs (or pay for it with our own money).  It's a pretty memory, one that could grant us the kindness of relaxing our shoulders as we close in on Christmas: It's the last leg. Most of us have done our parts and bought the gifts, and maybe now we can just enjoy our eggnog lattés and show up smiling. Because that's what matters, right? Just being happy enough to want to remember?  "Holiday Hypnosis" concludes, "Everyone should feel like a kid at Christmas. Share a happy, healthy holiday." And while this probably won't go into the annals of best holiday executions, it's at least reminded us that the kid we thought we'd grown out of is still in there somewhere, looking for Santa.

But there are also touching moments, like when a woman nudges a curtain open to discover snowfall, or an older man pantomimes the act of skating over the carpet.  And there's the giggling—that cup-runneth-over, tinkling-bell sound that tickles inside you and makes one guy keel over, clutching his tummy.  We're moved, despite ourselves. And when Jones snaps them back awake, it's as if they've returned from a faraway dream—still clutching wrapping paper, or on the floor, holding a very small drumstick. This isn't the time for debating the merits of hypnosis, or for whipping out that one time you tried it to quit smoking and it didn't work. Riding the emotions that unspool here requires a certain suspension of disbelief. There's something heartbreaking about letting an adult reinhabit her 5-year-old self, then taking that memory away in a dry finger-snap.  And we're not sure how to feel when Jones shows them the weird footage of all the things they did while under the spell. As grownups, there's something foolish and embarrassing about it, a sense of being tricked into losing the narrative grip of your life just long enough for it to be recorded. Scary thoughts can seep in: If I did that and didn't know it, what else could I do? But the subjects here laugh and cry.  "I never thought I'd see that again," the older man marvels, while a younger one laughs and says, "That's the young me!"  "It's been a while since I felt like this on Christmas," a woman adds, wiping tears away.  What keeps "Holiday Hypnosis" afloat is Jones' gentle, decisive manner. You feel like you can trust him to guide you safely through the alien. But what we're left with is a feather-light sense of what it felt like to be buoyed into the promise of the holidays without having to carry it on our own backs (or pay for it with our own money).  It's a pretty memory, one that could grant us the kindness of relaxing our shoulders as we close in on Christmas: It's the last leg. Most of us have done our parts and bought the gifts, and maybe now we can just enjoy our eggnog lattés and show up smiling. Because that's what matters, right? Just being happy enough to want to remember?  "Holiday Hypnosis" concludes, "Everyone should feel like a kid at Christmas. Share a happy, healthy holiday." And while this probably won't go into the annals of best holiday executions, it's at least reminded us that the kid we thought we'd grown out of is still in there somewhere, looking for Santa.

The website Breitbart.com posted an article last week which said that Walmart was “selling Black Lives Matter clothing and other items,” though the merchandise is actually being sold by Old Glory Merchandise, a music and entertainment apparel dealer out of Connecticut. Chuck Canterbury, the FOP president, wrote to Walmart CEO C. Douglas McMillon Tuesday to advise him that the Walmart website was selling “offensive shirts and sweatshirts,” and “I urge you to prohibit the use of the Walmart name and website for the retail sale of these products.” The Walmart site and Old Glory’s site also sell “Blue Lives Matter” shirts. Canterbury said he understood that a third party was selling the merchandise, but “I am concerned that allowing these articles to be sold in this way will damage your company’s good name amongst FOP members and other active and retired law enforcement officers.” Canterbury added, “Commercializing our differences will not help our local police and communities to build greater trust and respect for one another.” Walmart and Old Glory did not respond to requests for comment Tuesday evening. Jim Pasco, the executive director of the police union in Washington, D.C., said the issue was raised by union members who felt Walmart was selling anti-police items. “There are a lot of people who feel too many guns are sold,” Pasco said. “Why not speak out against things that might be seen as fomenting violence, rather than things that commit violence?” Walmart removed the  Black Lives Matter T-shirts after the country’s largest police union objected to the apparel it deemed highly offensive.

REUTERS/Lucas Jackson    5388513 Walmart will remove some of its Black Lives Matter-inspired clothing after facing pressure from the nation’s largest police organization. Walmart announced Tuesday it will no longer feature “Bulletproof” sweatshirts on its website after receiving a letter from the Fraternal Order of Police’s president, reports the IBTimes. The sweatshirts have “Black Lives Matter” written underneath “Bulletproof.” “Like other online retailers, we have a marketplace with millions of items offered by third parties that includes Blue Lives Matter, Black Lives Matter and All Lives Matter merchandise. After hearing concerns from customers, we are removing the specific item with the ‘bulletproof’ reference,” the company said in a statement. Chuck Canterbury, FOP’s president, warned the company from “profiting from racial division” in the letter. “At a time of year when we as a nation and indeed, as a world, should be coming together in hopes of peace on Earth and goodwill toward men, these third party sellers are profiting from racial division,” he declared. He also admonished the company from “commercializing our differences.” “Commercializing our differences will not help our local police and communities to build greater trust and respect for one another. Turning a buck on strained relationships will not contribute to the healing process,” he wrote. The shirts in question are made by a company called Old Glory Merchandise; Walmart features Old Glory’s clothing on its website. Walmart features other “Black Lives Matter” clothing, but has not said whether it will stop selling those. Follow Amber on Twitter Send tips to [email protected] .

After all, the real idea is find those companies with wide moats that offer steadily rising revenues and profits. Ultimately, those steady profits result in higher dividend payouts year in and year out. And when it comes to dividend stocks, retail kingpin Walmart Stores, Inc. (WMT) has already proven itself to be worthy of income investor’s portfolios. But WMT’s past history isn’t the only reason why dividend investors should be seriously considering Walmart stock. Recent moves will continue to keep the profits and revenues flowing at the retailing giant. Not to mention, fight off rivals in faster growing market segments. In the end, WMT has the goods to keep its payout going and growing into the future. By Aaron Levitt | December 2016 This slide show is from InvestorPlace, not the Kiplinger editorial staff. 1 2 3 4 5 Slide Show 2 of 5 Practical Advice from 3 Reasons Walmart Stock Is Still a Dividend Champ Walmart Stock and Its Massive Moat     Random Retail via Flickr If you took Target Corporation’s (TGT), Costco Wholesale Corporation’s (COST) and Amazon.com, Inc.’s (AMZN) total revenues and added them up, you still wouldn’t come close to the number of sales Walmart had last fiscal year. For Wally World and its 11,500-plus stores worldwide, that total came in at a staggering $482 billion worth of sales. That’s right — nearly a half a trillion dollars. WMT is simply the world’s largest retailer. But it’s not just sheer volume of sales that makes Walmart stock a great dividend play. It’s how it generates those sales that is the impressive thing. The key comes down to WMT’s product mix. Sam Walton’s concept of the supercenter — being a one-stop shop for consumers — is continuing to pay-off big time. WMT offers a wide range of items. That includes consumer staples like toilet paper and dish soap to consumer discretionary purchases like televisions and toys. The duality of that product mix allows Walmart stock to benefit in both good times and during bad. Consumer staples tend to lead in any environment. After all, you still need to wash your hair or do the dishes even if the economy is taking a beating. And when things are great, consumers head on over to the other side of the aisle and snag-up a karaoke machine or two. The steadiness of the staples combined with the extra boosts form the discretionary items have continued to help WMT push up its revenues over its history. While cost cutting and focus on margins have helped boost Walmart’s profits. Overall, they’ve helped Walmart stock become a great income play. (The current dividend yield is 2.8%.) WMT declared its first dividend back in 1974 and it has managed to increase its annual cash dividend every single year since then. That 42 years of unbroken increases has been driven by the constant growth and steady sales portfolio SEE ALSO FROM KIPLINGER: 8 Best 'YARP' Stocks for Dividend Investors 1 2 3 4 5 Slide Show 3 of 5 Practical Advice from 3 Reasons Walmart Stock Is Still a Dividend Champ The Massive Future for Walmart Stock     Mike Mozart via Wikipedia And if history is any sort of guide, then WMT’s future as a dividend champion is almost assured. That’s because the world’s largest retailer is taking the steps to combat a growing threat and remove problems with its stores. The obvious threat is the continued growth in e-commerce. It’s no secret that Amazon and other online retailers are starting to eat brick-n-mortar’s lunch when it comes to sales. Even Walmart has felt the heat in recent years. Last year, WMT’s annual sales shrank for the first time since it went public. But the world’s largest retailer isn’t taking that lying down. Walmart has undergone a massive e-commerce transformation. That transformation started with a selection of apps, in-store logistics upgrades and a massive $3 billion purchase of Jet.com. Jet, which is the brain-child of online pioneer Marc Lore, uses various algorithms that reduces prices based on shipping location and quantity. The buyout was designed to complement Walmart’s own mantra of low prices. And it seems to be working. During WMT’s most recent earnings report, online sales jumped a solid 20.6%. And in only its second holiday season as a company, Jet.com has experienced torrid growth under Walmart. Over the critical Black Friday weekend, Jet sales and traffic rose over 300% and the average order was 19% higher in terms of dollar amount. That’s just the right amount of growth to power Walmart stock ahead. And while e-commerce is clearly the future, WMT isn’t relaxing on its steady stream of store revenues either. Walmart has announced that it plans on investing around $2.7 billion into its employees. This includes higher wages, better training and customer service focuses. That’s a page directly right out of Costco’s playbook. The idea is to drive the in-store experience and make Walmart the only place consumer’s shop — online or in person. Like its e-commerce efforts, this store focus is also working with both traffic and sales up in the recent quarter.

Slow, but steady growth from its massive footprint of retail space will continue to provide plenty of cash flows over multiple economic cycles. Meanwhile, its effort on the digital front will provide plenty of extra boosts and help platform the very distant future. And given that initiatives are actually working, as evident by rising sales and visitor traffic, Walmart has the goods to keep powering its dividend further. Even more so when you consider that WMT stock features a low payout ratio of just 50%. That gives it plenty of time to make sure its commence and store plans really start working. For investors, that means Walmart’s status as a Dividend Aristocrat is pretty safe.

The protest shirts in question are sold through Walmart’s website by Old Glory Merchandise. Tee-shirts that say simply “Black Lives Matter” as well as “Blue Lives Matter” and “All Lives Matter” are also available on the website. FOP president Chuck Canterbury wrote to Walmart’s CEO complaining that the shirts would “damage” the company’s “good name” among law enforcement officers. “Commercializing our differences,” he wrote, “will not help our local police and communities to build greater trust and respect for one another.” On Tuesday night, Walmart responded with a statement explaining, “Like other online retailers, we have a marketplace with millions of items offered by third parties that includes Blue Lives Matter, Black Lives Matter and All Lives Matter merchandise. After hearing concerns from customers, we are removing the specific item with the ‘bulletproof’ reference.” [Washington Post] Read Next Your browser is out of date.

The retailer said it is removing the “Bulletproof” shirts, but not its other “Black Lives Matter” shirts, the Washington Post reports. Last week, Breitbart published an article saying that “Walmart is selling Black Lives Matter clothing and other items.” According to the Post, the merchandise is only sold on the retailer’s website through a Connecticut music and apparel company. On Tuesday, Chuck Canterbury, the president of the National Fraternal Order of Police, wrote to Walmart’s CEO, C. Douglas McMillon, urging him to “prohibit the use of the Walmart name and website for the retail sale of these products.” Per the Post: Canterbury said he understood that a third party was selling the merchandise, but “I am concerned that allowing these articles to be sold in this way will damage your company’s good name amongst FOP members and other active and retired law enforcement officers.” Canterbury added, “Commercializing our differences will not help our local police and communities to build greater trust and respect for one another.” On Tuesday night, Walmart said in a statement, “Like other online retailers, we have a marketplace with millions of items offered by third parties that includes Blue Lives Matter, Black Lives Matter and All Lives Matter merchandise.

About 11 firefighters from the two departments visited Walmart on Dec. 20 and shopped with 20 kids from the community. Sheryl Sabo-Grieve says it's fabulous watching firefighters save Christmas for kids at the Jackson Interfaith Shelter, 414 S. Blackstone St. But she makes sure everybody understands they save more than that. "It's just a great way that these guys reach out into the community and help out," said Sabo-Grieve, the shelter's meal volunteer coordinator. A Salvation Army employee drove kids from the shelter to Walmart, and some other independent families were invited as well. The shopping trip was the Jackson Fire Department's 10th and Summit Township Fire Department's fourth year. "The guys really like this," said Tim Gonzales, Jackson firefighter. "The kids shop for themselves, sometimes for their parents and the money comes from collections throughout the year. It's all from the guys and Walmart gave some gift cards." Vicky Strobel is a Walmart customer service manager. She got involved in these types of shopping trips 13 years ago and hasn't looked back. "We cry a lot," Strobel said. "It makes your heart feel good." And while it makes the kids and Walmart employees feel good, the firefighters get just as much out of it, Summit Township Fire Lt. Aaron Osburn said. "It's a lot of fun, we enjoy it," Osburn said. "The kids have fun but I think we have an equal amount." Summit Township Fire Capt. Scott Stoker had a blast shopping. The kid he was partnered with got a giant stuffed animal and red flowers. "It's just great to come out," Stoker said. "We serve them every day, but it's fortunate that we can come in and help them out."

Published Dec 21st, 2016 11:20 am ksouza@talkbusiness.net / @tbarkansas A recent survey from Prosper Insight & Analytics of nearly 7,000 U.S. adults shows that 26.2% of holiday shoppers bought gifts from Amazon this year, increasing from 10% of respondents surveyed this time last year. “Amazon.com will be the Grinch who stole Christmas from competing retailers this year,” Pam Goodfellow of Prosper Insights noted in a recent blog post. Goodfellow said Wal-Mart Stores ranks in second place with holiday shoppers at 14.5%. Competitors like Target, Kohl’s, Best Buy, JCPenney, Toys R Us and Costco had single digit percentage shares, according to the Prosper data. She said this is the third consecutive holiday season Amazon has won the biggest share of online holiday shoppers. Goodfellow said Wal-Mart has lost share since 2013. “Walmart has realized a 3-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of -13.9% to Amazon’s +15.2%. Consequently, Amazon has been steadily increasing the gap between it and Walmart, which is at nearly 12 percentage points this year,” Goodfellow notes. “It appears that Walmart still hasn’t figured out how to address the Amazon challenge.” It should come as no surprise to see Amazon pick up online holiday share, given that an estimated 50% of U.S. households hold Amazon Prime memberships, costing a minimum of $100 annually, which gets them two-day shipping on most products. Amazon customers do overlap with Wal-Mart customers. Cowen & Co estimates that 42% of Amazon Prime members are also Wal-Mart shoppers, compared with just 20% in 2013. Annibal Sodero, assistant professor at the University of Arkansas, said Amazon attracts shoppers to its ecosystem with subscriptions like Prime. Estimates are that 55% of online consumers search Amazon first, surpassing Google this year. U.S. shoppers spent about 30% of their online time at Amazon.com, compared to 3% at Walmart.com. He has said online there is no comparison between Amazon and Walmart.com. However, the vast majority of retail sales this holiday season will happen in brick and mortar stores. The National Retail Federation estimates retail sales in November and December (excluding autos, gas and restaurants) will increase 3.6% to $655.8 billion. Online sales are forecast to increase between 7% and 10% over last year to as much as $117 billion. Wal-Mart also is a retailer with more than 4,000 stores and the largest grocer in the nation with a logistics operation which could give it an advantage over companies like Amazon now attempting online grocery. Analysts don’t expect online sales to outpace store sales any time soon. But some categories like apparel are moving in that direction. Amazon expects this year it will sell more apparel than Wal-Mart and by 2018 it will be the second largest seller of consumables such as laundry detergent and toilet paper. Wal-Mart threw a wrench in expectations when it acquired Jet.com for $3.3 billion earlier this year. Since then Wal-Mart Stores CEO Doug McMillon said he expects online sales to grow between 20% and 30% over the next three years. Online sales grew 19% in the first half of this year, but the online business remains only a fraction of Wal-Mart’s overall $500 billion annual revenue. Keith Anderson, vice president of strategy and insights for Profitero, told Talk Business & Politics, Wal-Mart faces plenty of challenges as it works to build market share online. “Amazon has been at this for more than a decade and continues to invest in ancillary devices and products other than retail. But each of these add value to Amazon customers,” Anderson said. Michael Levin, co-founder of Consumer Intelligence Research Partners, estimates Prime members spend an average of $1,100 annually with Amazon, not counting the membership fee. Non-prime members spend about $600. In contrast Wal-Mart has said it’s online-only customers spend an average of $200 annually, while store only shoppers spend $1,400. Shoppers who use both methods have an average spend of $2,500, and represent an audience Wal-Mart hopes to grow. One way that is happening is via an expansive rollout of the Walmart U.S. online grocery pickup service now in 100 markets, up from five earlier this year. Wal-Mart spokesman Ravi Jariwala said the service receives high customer satisfaction scores, repeat rates and net promoter scores. Jariwala said it’s too early to discuss details of the retailer’s recent grocery pickup and fueling station which opened two weeks ago in Denver. The online grocery pickup combined with a fueling station has been on the drawing board for more than three years dating back to former Walmart U.S. CEO Bill Simon, who talked about the model as one of several the retailer would test.

Here’s The List Shopping 2 0 0 December 21, 2016 Walmart Christmas Eve Hours: What Time Do Stores And Malls Close December 24? Here’s The List Cheryl P What time does Walmart close on Christmas Eve, and what time will other retail stores and malls close their doors on Saturday night? If you still have holiday gifts to buy, get your list together, and check out the list below for a complete rundown of holiday store hours for popular retailers including Walmart, Target, Best Buy, Toys R Us, Kohl’s, JCPenney, Pink, Macy’s, Old Navy, and more. This year, Christmas Eve falls on a Saturday, so if you are headed to the mall to finish up your holiday shopping, expect crowded parking lots, long lines, empty shelves, and the worst thing of all, stores that have closed early for the holiday, including the always popular Walmart and Walmart Superstores. Last year, Walmart stores stayed open until 8 p.m. on Christmas Eve, but that’s not the case for 2016. According to CNN Money, the company has decided to lock their doors at 6 p.m. this year to give their employees a much-needed break. And yes, all Walmart stores will be closed on Christmas Day as well. Not all retail stores and malls will close early on December 24, and there are a few options if you can’t get out to shop until after Walmart closes. Here’s a list of retail store closing times (including grocery stores) for Christmas Eve, as well as some information about stores that will be open 24-hours a day in the days leading up to Santa’s big night. 2016 Christmas Eve store closing times Stores close early Christmas Eve. [Image by Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images] Before we get to the list of retail store holiday hours, keep in mind that it’s not just your favorite big-box stores, mall stores, and grocery stores that will be closing early on Christmas Eve. According to the U.S. Postal Service, the lobby areas at most post office branches will close at noon and will not reopen until Monday, December 26. If your bank is normally open on a Saturday, call ahead to find out if they are observing special holiday hours. Whether you need gift cards, toys, clothing, electronics, or just some gift wrap and tape, a number of stores will be open as late as 10 p.m. on Christmas Eve. According to CNBC, Kohl’s will be open around-the-clock from December 20 through closing time on Christmas Eve. Toys R Us will stay open for 39 straight hours starting December 23. Here’s a breakdown by closing time of some of the most popular retailers in the U.S. Closing times may vary by location, so it’s always a good idea to call ahead.

If you are hoping to get to popular mall stores like Pink, Victoria’s Secret, American Eagle, Bath and Body Works, and Aeropostale, the closing times for these stores will rely on the holiday hours set by the mall the stores are in. If the store does not have an exit door separate from the mall, as is the case with JCPenney, Old Navy, and Macy’s stores, shoppers can expect to find the store closing times to be in accordance with the mall’s operating hours. Have you finished your Christmas shopping or will you be heading out to buy gifts on Christmas Eve?

 Walmart pulls 'Black Lives Matter' shirt after police accuse retailer of 'profiting from racial division' Kate Taylor Dec. 21, 2016, 12:45 PM 4,694 facebook linkedin twitter email print Liberty University student Jeff Long, of Washington DC., wears a Black Lives Matter t-shirt as he looks for a seat prior to a speech by Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Va., Monday, Jan. 18, 2016.Steve Helber/AP Walmart pulled a Black Lives Matter shirt and hoodie from its online store Wednesday after police accused the retailer of helping third-party sellers profit "from racial division."  The hoodie and shirt that were pulled featured the slogan, "Bulletproof: Black Lives Matter," and were being sold through Walmart Marketplace, the retailer's website that features millions of items from third-party sellers.  On Tuesday, Chuck Canterbury, the national president of the Fraternal Order of Police, wrote a public letter to Walmart calling out its Marketplace site for selling merchandise that promotes the Black Lives Matter movement, which organizes protests across the US to draw attention to racism and police brutality. "Commercializing our differences will not help our local police and communities to built greater trust and respect for one another," Canterbury wrote in the letter. In response, Walmart said in a statement that it would remove apparel that said, "Bulletproof: Black Lives Matter," from its online store. Shirts and hoodies with this "Bulletproof" design have been removed from Walmart's online store.Old Glory "Like other online retailers, we have a marketplace with millions of items offered by third parties that includes Blue Lives Matter, Black Lives Matter and All Lives Matter merchandise," Walmart said in a statement. "After hearing concerns from customers, we are removing the specific item with the 'bulletproof' reference." The "Bulletproof" shirts are made by Old Glory, an apparel retailer based in Centerbrook, Connecticut that also sells "All Lives Matter" and "Blue Lives Matter" shirts through Walmart's website.  The retail giant's website will continue to offer items including t-shirts, sweatshirts, and hats bearing the words "Black Lives Matter," created and sold by third-party retailers. Walmart's website also features apparel that read "All Lives Matter," "Blue Lives Matter," "Homeless Lives Matter," and "Journalists Lives Matter." A search "Black Lives Matter" on Walmart's site Wednesday morning. The 'Bulletproof' hoodie, second from the left, has since been cut from the site.Walmart.com As of Wednesday at 11 a.m., the "Bulletproof" shirt could no longer be accessed on Walmart's website, but other "Black Lives Matter" merchandise remained available.  Breitbart, a right-wing website that has been critical of the Black Lives Matter movement, published an article last week calling out Walmart for selling "Black Lives Matter" merchandise on its website. Following the publication of Brietbart's article, a number of people took to social media to complain about the shirts.  SEE ALSO: Walmart under fire for 'disgusting' 9/11 tribute NOW WATCH: The most surprising brands millennials love Loading video...

Black Lives Matter.” The national Fraternal Order of Police wrote to the retailer on Tuesday asking it to pull the shirts. Last week, an article on the right-wing website Breitbart complained that Wal-Mart dropped items that displayed the Confederate flag but still sold the “bulletproof” items. Wal-Mart wasn’t actually selling the “Bulletproof. Black Lives Matter” clothes itself, but they were available for purchase on its website via a third-party merchant. “Like other online retailers, we have a marketplace with millions of items offered by third parties that includes Blue Lives Matter, Black Lives Matter and All Lives Matter merchandise,” a Wal-Mart spokesman said. “After hearing concerns from customers, we are removing the specific item with the ‘bulletproof’ reference.” Wal-Mart’s move satisfied the police union, which does not object to the phrase “Black Lives Matters” by itself, according to James Pasco, the group’s executive director. “The bulletproof thing goes to the new assertiveness of some violence prone individuals to take action directly against police. We find it offensive for that reason,” Pasco said. Pasco added the police union had yet to reach out to the third party vendor, Old Glory, that sells the bulletproof items. But Old Glory owner Glenn Morelli said he’s already decided to take down the shirt from his site as well. “It wasn’t a big seller at all. The Blue Lives Matter sells more than the Black Lives Matter or bulletproof shirts combined,” Morelli said. “We don’t like to offend anybody.” He said his company offers more than 500,000 different kinds of shirts and sweatshirts on its site. “When you sell that many, you have to sell all different kinds of shirts,” he said. “It’s hard to make everybody happy.” Filed in: National/World News Suggest a correction × Suggest A Correction Your name Your email Report a typo or grammatical error Cancel Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn Pinterest Email Have a news tip?

Published Dec 21st, 2016 11:55 am ksouza@talkbusiness.net / @tbarkansas Online retail should top $590 billion in annual sales by 2021. U.S. online retail topped $100 billion in 2006, and online sales are expected to top $345 billion this year, according to Forrester Research. Forrester said Amazon captured $23 billion more in U.S. e-commerce sales last year over 2014. Amazon’s growth accounted for about 51% of the total U.S. online sales growth last year. Walmart.com is a distant second place despite spending more than $6 billion in this area in the past three years. Market watchers suggest Walmart.com will never catch Amazon in terms of market size and share, but in terms of omnichannel, Wal-Mart has a head start with its nearly 5,000 U.S. stores which can be showrooms, pickup centers and fulfillment centers as more retail gravitates online. Amazon recently has become interested in opening physical stores that are a test bed for consumer convenience. While the majority of retail sales are conducted in physical stores, the relationship between physical and online commerce is growing. Forrester said more than 40%, or $1.5 trillion, of U.S. retail sales were in some way influenced by the internet – which could include product research, and writing online reviews of items purchased. Jason Long, CEO of Shift Marketing Group, said there are low barriers to entry for online retailers, whether they choose to set up their own store or sell through various marketplaces or use both, the competition online is fierce and will only intensify. Forrester said merchants surveyed earlier this year cited online and and online merchandising as their top two priorities for 2016. The merchants said in light of expensive paid search costs, they were more likely to focus on customer service relationships, personalization and loyalty programs to try and drive more engagement with shoppers. Noting that omnichannel efforts are a work in progress for many retailers, merchants were optimistic about ship-from-the-store, in-store pickup programs and other efforts such as endless aisle which have proven successful in getting shoppers in-store to search online for expanded product options. Sam’s Club reports moderate success with endless aisle in healthcare products such as lift chairs, fine jewelry and patio furniture. Shoppers can see a small sampling of these products in the clubs, but there is a much broader selection in a catalog located in the clubs. The club members select the item they want, pay for it and it can be delivered to their home the following day in many cases. Because the barrier to entry is low, the online retail market is huge, and the market share held by Amazon makes gaining any ground a constant challenge for competitors like Walmart.com. Wal-Mart has spent around $6 billion on its e-commerce division in three years, including buying Jet.com for $3.1 billion earlier this year. In buying up a competitive threat like Jet.com, Wal-Mart remains well behind Amazon in online market share. Last year Amazon’s total online sales online $79.268 billion, making it the nation’s largest e-tailer. Amazon’s Prime membership has grown to 63 million, with almost half the households in the U.S. Wal-Mart’s e-commerce sales of $13.484 billion rank the retailer in second place. Wal-Mart also offers a shipping pass membership, akin to Prime which was launched this year, but the retailer has not shared how many subscribers have signed up. Analysts said Prime is not just about free shipping. It brings subscribers into the Amazon ecosystem. That is something Wal-Mart has not been able to accomplish, despite launching WalmartPay earlier this year along with other mobile app services such as gift registry and prescription refill. Apple ranks third at $12 billion in online sales. Macy’s comes in fifth at $4.928 billion, while Home Depot ranked sixth with $3.78 billion in online sales last year. Wal-Mart competitor Target had $2.524 billion in online sales putting it in 11th place. Wal-Mart’s online traffic equals just 7% of weekly store traffic and is approaching 3% of the sales. The majority of Wal-Mart’s online shoppers also shop in the retailer’s stores, 80% at least once a month and half of online shoppers frequent the retailer’s stores once a week, according to analysts with Cleveland Research. Keith Anderson, vice president of strategy and insights for Profitero, said Wal-Mart is known as a fast follower in all of its other success stories over the years. He said when it comes to e-commerce it’s the first movers who will likely win the gold. He said Amazon was the first mover in e-commerce and continues to invest aggressively which has garnered it accelerated growth over Walmart.com and the rest of U.S. retail. Anderson said Amazon has been at the e-commerce game much longer, and it’s not important that Wal-Mart ever catch up entirely. He said there is likely room for two big players, and Walmart U.S. has a big lead in terms of grocery, which will likely be one of the last categories to migrate purely online.

Hong Walmart to stop selling 'Bulletproof: Black Lives Matter' shirts after police protest By Tom Jackman • Washington Post Dec 21, 2016 (…) AP Photo/Jae C. Hong Updated at 12:38 p.m. The president of the national Fraternal Order of Police, the country's largest police organization, on Tuesday asked Walmart to stop selling T-shirts and sweatshirts which say "Black Lives Matter" and "Bulletproof" on the department store's website. On Tuesday night, Walmart said it would remove the shirts which say "Bulletproof," but not the "Black Lives Matter" shirts. "Black Lives Matter" is a slogan and protest movement which emerged after the death of Trayvon Martin in 2012 and police-involved slayings in 2014, and is seen as offensive by many in law enforcement. The website Breitbart.com posted an article last week which said that Walmart was "selling Black Lives Matter clothing and other items," though the merchandise is actually being sold through Walmart's website by Old Glory Merchandise, a music and entertainment apparel dealer out of Connecticut. Chuck Canterbury, the FOP president, wrote to Walmart CEO C. Douglas McMillon Tuesday to advise him that the Walmart website was selling "offensive shirts and sweatshirts," and "I urge you to prohibit the use of the Walmart name and website for the retail sale of these products." The Walmart site and Old Glory's site also sell "Blue Lives Matter" shirts. Canterbury said he understood that a third party was selling the merchandise, but "I am concerned that allowing these articles to be sold in this way will damage your company's good name amongst FOP members and other active and retired law enforcement officers." Canterbury added, "Commercializing our differences will not help our local police and communities to build greater trust and respect for one another." "Like other online retailers, we have a marketplace with millions of items offered by third parties that includes Blue Lives Matter, Black Lives Matter and All Lives Matter merchandise," Walmart said in a statement late Tuesday. "After hearing concerns from customers, we are removing the specific item with the 'bulletproof' reference." The "bulletproof" shirts say "Bulletproof" with "Black Lives Matter" beneath that line. Old Glory did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Jim Pasco, the executive director of the police union in Washington, said the issue was raised by union members who felt Walmart was selling anti-police items. "There are a lot of people who feel too many guns are sold," Pasco said. "Why not speak out against things that might be seen as fomenting violence, rather than things that commit violence?" _____________________ Our earlier story, posted at 2 a.m. Wednesday. The president of the national Fraternal Order of Police, the country's largest police organization, on Tuesday asked Walmart to stop selling T-shirts and sweatshirts which say "Black Lives Matter" and "Bulletproof" on the department store's website. "Black Lives Matter" is a slogan and protest movement which emerged after the death of Trayvon Martin in 2012 and police-involved slayings in 2014, and is seen as offensive by many in law enforcement.

Douglas McMillon Tuesday to advise him that the Walmart website was selling "offensive shirts and sweatshirts," and "I urge you to prohibit the use of the Walmart name and website for the retail sale of these products."

(File) Print Email Christian Alexandersen | calexandersen@pennlive.com By Christian Alexandersen | calexandersen@pennlive.com The Patriot-News Email the author | Follow on Twitter on December 21, 2016 at 1:27 PM, updated December 22, 2016 at 10:56 AM comments The National Fraternal Order of Police has pressured Walmart to discontinue selling a shirt on their website that says 'BULLETPROOF: Black Lives Matter.'  Walmart issued a statement Tuesday that said it would stop selling the t-shirts and sweatshirts, but would continue selling items that say just 'Black Lives Matter,' 'Blue Lives Matter' and 'All Lives Matter.' The 'BULLETPROOF' shirt was created by a third-party dealer, Old Glory Merchandise, and sold on Walmart's website. The decision to stop selling the shirt came after FOP President C. Douglas McMillon sent a letter dated Dec. 20 asking Walmart to do so. McMillon referred to the shirts as "offensive." A shirt sold on Walmart's website said "BULLETPROOF" with "Black Lives Matter" underneath it. Screenshots  "At a time of year when we as a nation and indeed, as a world, should be coming together in hopes of peace on Earth and goodwill toward men, these third party sellers are profiting from racial division," McMillon wrote. "Commercializing our differences will not help out local police and communities to build greater trust and respect for one another." He added, "Turning a buck on strained relationships will not contribute to the healing process." By Wednesday morning, the shirts were still visible on the Walmart website but they could not be purchased online.

Black Lives Matter.” The national Fraternal Order of Police wrote to the retailer on Tuesday asking it to pull the shirts. Last week, an article on the right-wing web site Breitbart complained that Walmart dropped items that displayed the Confederate flag but still sold the “bulletproof” items. Walmart wasn’t actually selling the “Bulletproof. Black Lives Matter.” clothes itself, but they were available for purchase on its website via a third-party merchant. “Like other online retailers, we have a marketplace with millions of items offered by third parties that includes Blue Lives Matter, Black Lives Matter and All Lives Matter merchandise,” said a Walmart spokesman. “After hearing concerns from customers, we are removing the specific item with the ‘bulletproof’ reference.” Walmart’s move satisfied the police union, which does not object to the phrase “Black Lives Matters” by itself, according to James Pasco, the group’s executive director. “The bulletproof thing goes to the new assertiveness of some violence prone individuals to take action directly against police. We find it offensive for that reason,” said Pasco. Pasco added that the police union had yet to reach out to the third party vendor, Old Glory, that sells the bulletproof items. But Old Glory owner Glenn Morelli said he’s already decided to take down the shirt from his site as well. “It wasn’t a big seller at all. The Blue Lives Matter sells more than the Black Lives Matter or bulletproof shirts combined,” Morelli said. “We don’t like to offend anybody.” He said his company offers more than 500,000 different kinds of shirts and sweatshirts on its site. “When you sell that many, you have to sell all different kinds of shirts,” he said. “It’s hard to make everybody happy.” GamerGate critic Brianna Wu to run for Congress Banks told to give back 'unfair' mortgage payments Related Posts Lockheed Martin CEO promises Trump she’ll cut F-35 costs Hulk Hogan’s $100 million sex tape suit has mostly female jury Denis Leary on Jon Stewart’s exit: ‘What the f*** is wrong with you?’ Japanese beer giant Asahi seeks to swallow Peroni and Grolsch Leave a Reply Cancel reply You must be logged in to post a comment.

The retail giant, in an unprecedented move, announced its plan to cut Christmas Eve hours Tuesday. The country’s largest retailer is slashing its Christmas Eve hours at stores across the country by two hours. Previously open until 8 p.m. on Christmas Eve, stores will now close at 6 p.m. The store will also be closed on Christmas Day. In a news release Tuesday, Walmart headquarters announced the move as a gesture to its employees. “Our associates work hard all year to make this holiday season special for our customers, and we truly appreciate what they do every day,” said Judith McKenna, the company’s executive vice president and chief operating officer. “We also know that getting home on Christmas Eve to spend time with families is important. That’s why this year we’ll be closing at 6 p.m. on Christmas Eve.” Related Stories Last-Minute Holiday Sales To Shop Ahead Of Holidays ‘Bulletproof: Black Lives Matter’ Clothing Pulled Off Walmart Shelves A Walmart employee fixes a sign indicating there are 30 more days until Christmas at a store in Miami, Florida, Nov. 24, 2015. Walmart announced Tuesday they'd be slashing their store hours on Christmas Eve from 8 p.m. to 6 p.m. Photo: Getty The move comes as something of a surprise for the company, which has drawn criticism in the past for its Thanksgiving Day hours, during which Black Friday sales at the store start at 6 p.m. The store also starts its Cyber Monday deals on Black Friday. In recent years, protesters have railed against the retail giant’s labor practices, though the company has taken steps to better serve their employees as of late.  In February 2016, Walmart raised the wages of more than one million of its employees, both part-time and full-time. The company also altered its scheduling system to make it more regular for its employees in order to provide them with more stable situations. The retailer employs more than two million people worldwide, more than any other company in the U.S., and operates in 28 different countries. Last year, Walmart raked in $486 billion in sales.

(WGNO) – A Kenner man was arrested today in connection with a kidnapping and carjacking that happened Dec. 15 in the Walmart parking lot in Kenner. According to Kenner Police, Clyde Reed, 35, is accused of trying to steal a TV from Walmart by placing the television in a shopping cart and trying to wheel it out without paying. When confronted by Walmart employees, Reed abandoned the stolen television and ran into the parking lot. He then jumped into a 2014 Ford F-150 pickup truck that was parked with the engine running. Reed took off in the truck without knowing that the truck’s owner, a 28-year-old man, was resting in the back seat. The owner of the truck tried to get control of his truck, and an altercation ensued. Reed is accused of hitting the victim and then crashing the truck into an SUV in the parking lot. Reed jumped out of the truck and fled on foot. The driver of the SUV had to be extricated from the vehicle. He suffered lacerations to the head. Reed was arrested by the U.S. Marshal’s Service and Kenner Police on a warrant for carjacking, simple kidnapping, negligent injuring, simple battery, reckless operation of a motor vehicle, hit-and-run driving and theft of goods. No bond was set as of mid-day Wednesday. Anyone who witnessed the carjacking and crash is asked to call Kenner Police Detective Aaron Savoie at 504-712-2301.

Subscribe for $59/Yr - Save $50 Lowdown: See How Audi Targets Toy Stereotypes in Spain Published on December 21, 2016. Most Popular The Lowdown is Ad Age's weekly look at news nuggets from across the world of marketing, including trends, campaign tidbits, executive comings and goings and more. Playing, like driving, should not be influenced by gender stereotypes. That is the message Audi in Spain is sending with a new animated digital video ad called "The doll that chose to drive." The spot follows a doll as she escapes the pink-colored girl toy aisle for the blue-tinted boys section. She browses toy trucks and police cars before hopping in a blue Audi. She revs the engine and takes it for a James Bond-style race. The spot ends when a boy shopping with his mom picks up the toy car with the doll in it. She tries to dissuade him from buying it, suggesting they don't go together. But he decides otherwise. The spot, by Proximity Barcelona and produced by Post23, is aimed at breaking down toy stereotypes during the Christmas season. Audi has produced a limited-edition toy of the car and the doll, according to a statement. "These two toys, usually kept apart by gender stereotypes, have been brought together this Christmas to show that play, like driving, is a gender-free area," according to a statement distributed by Proximity. Hatchimals are one holiday gift that seem to require no advertising. This year's must-have toy has largely been out of stock in most stores or online since early November, except for brief appearances in Black Friday promotions or weekly shipments to stores that get snatched up within minutes. Yet Walmart has continued to advertise the creatures prominently online, including its own exclusive Burtle Hatchimal as recently as Dec. 20 on the Yahoo sign-in page. The "Save Money. Live Better." folks also are doing Google search ads that lead to Hatchimals on sale from third-party vendors on Walmart.com for more than four times the original $49.99 to $59.99 price tag for the Spin Master product. Credit: Walmart/Yahoo One person familiar with Walmart believes the continued Hatchimal advertising may be to help bolster its third-party marketplace, where it's long been at a distinct disadvantage to Amazon. Walmart also is advertising lower-cost and more available alternatives on its site and in search at times too – including FurReal Friends Torch, My Blazin' Dragon for a mere $59, $20 off the original price. But the continued advertising for three-figure Hatchimals has produced a bit of grumbling about Walmart in social media. Why advertise something that seemingly sells itself? A Walmart spokeswoman noted that new shipments of Hatchimals continue to arrive at stores all the time – even if they sell out fast. And Walmart isn't entirely alone here. Toys 'R Us and Target also have been buying Google search ads against Hatchimals queries, generally later in the day than Walmart. If it's any consolation to parents who can't lay their hands on Hatchimals it's that reviews are mixed. Immediately after the blessed event, in which after hours of rubbing and other coddling the plush toy emerges from its shell, parents report their little ones often lose interest, whether the Hatchimal cost $49.99 or $259.95. Moving on to the beer beat: MillerCoors is taking some heat for billboards erected in Milwaukee that plug higher alcohol content for Milwaukee's Best Ice. The signs simply say: "Milwaukee's Best Ice. Now 6.9% Alc/Vol." The brew used to be at 5.9%. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel this week covered the billboards in a lengthy piece that included several critical comments, including from a well-known activist and Catholic priest in Chicago named Michael Pfleger, who alleged that MillerCoors "made a conscious choice" to plug the higher alcohol in the brew. "We're no longer just advertising the drink – now we're advertising how much alcohol you can get in the consumption of the drink," he told the newspaper. The brewer told the MJS that it is "committed to leading the industry in transparency so that our consumers can make fully informed choices." Here is one way to make an old ad slogan new again: Procter & Gamble Co.'s Pantene has turned its 1980s "Don't hate me because I'm beautiful" slogan on its head with an ad from mixed martial artist Ronda Rousey. Ms. Rousey, due for a big Dec. 30 match against current champion Amanda Nunes to regain her UFC bantamweight title, turns the selling line into "Don't hate me because I'm strong." "Ronda is the future of strong women everywhere," said P&G VP-North America Hair Care Jodi Allen in a statement. The ad from WPP's Grey is about "women rising above society's expectations and proving once and for all that strong is always beautiful," Ms. Allen said. Mark Cuban, the only "Shark Tank" investor to put money into Dude Wipes during an episode of the series last year, makes a cameo appearance uttering the brand's "take it to the hole" tagline in a new ad for the masculine-hygiene brand. In a new two-minute video from production company Polymyth Chicago. Dude Products portrays its wipes as a solution for a dad who finds himself stuck in a stall that's out of toilet paper in the boy's restroom of his son's elementary school on parent's night. Certainly, Dude Wipes beat the alternative of terrifying the occupant of the stall next door to ask for help, or using junior's artwork to do the job. The ad helps support Dude Wipes' recent move into the toilet-paper aisle at Target stores, the first startup "non-billion-dollar-brand" to make it there, a Dude spokesman said. But, course, Dude Wipes are so much more, alternately billed as a sort of portable quick shower for guys who need to freshen up in all kinds of ways. Finally, one executive move to report this week: Reusable water bottle brand S'well is upping its business prowess by hiring its first chief marketing officer. A branding veteran, Judd Harner previously worked with companies including Coca-Cola, American Express and Chico's. Tasked with leading all marketing efforts, he will be CMO and exec VP at the six-year-old company, which is known for its colorful bottles beloved by celebrities such as Julia Roberts and mission of sustainability. In growth mode, S'well, which has a reported $50 million in sales, also recently hired a CFO from Fast Retailing. Contributing: Adrianne Pasquarelli, Jack Neff, E.J.

Anderson was shot and killed during an officer-involved shooting in the Dallas Walmart parking lot on Friday evening, according to Oregon State Police. A preliminary investigation by OSP and its partners revealed that at 5:26 p.m., three Dallas police officers responded to a complaint of an adult male who appeared intoxicated in the parking lot at Walmart. OSP Captain Bill Fugate said that an officer does not have to catch someone driving, but can use probable cause to determine if they were operating a vehicle while intoxicated. Officers attempted to take Anderson, 36, of Dallas, into custody for driving under the influence of intoxicants. According to the report from OSP, Anderson resisted arrest and fired as many as two rounds, striking Sgt. Rob Hatchell in the leg. Hatchell and officer Mike Fleming returned fire, striking Anderson, reports state. Anderson was pronounced dead at the scene. Hatchell was released from the hospital shortly after receiving treatment for his injuries. All three officers have been placed on paid administrative leave pending the outcome of the investigation. Officer Aaron Mollahan was also present and was not injured. Investigators located Anderson's firearm at the scene. Fugate said Monday that he did not know who the gun was registered to nor if police video of the incident was available. He said information would be shared once authorized by District Attorney Aaron Felton. Anderson had previous police encounters, according to court records. The most recent was a 2015 violation of his probation following a conviction in a DUII incident that took place in late 2013. The community has reacted in a variety of ways. Dallas Police Chief Tom Simpson said the department gives any threat the appropriate level of attention and shares information with other public safety officials in the region. OSP is leading the investigation at Simpson’s and Felton’s request. OSP is being assisted by Grand Ronde Tribal Police, Polk County Sheriff’s Office, Monmouth Police Department, Independence Police Department, Salem Police Department, and Dallas Fire & EMS.

Here are some last-minute options By Associated Press Published: 11:48 EST, 21 December 2016 | Updated: 11:48 EST, 21 December 2016 e-mail NEW YORK (AP) — Holiday shopping procrastinators can breathe easy. Yes, most online shipping deadlines have passed. But many retailers are offering other ways to get gifts at the last minute, whether it's staying open through the wee hours of the night like Toys R Us, or offering Christmas Eve store pickup like Wal-Mart. Here are some options for those still scrambling to buy presents: MIDNIGHT RUNS FILE - In this Thursday, Nov. 24, 2016, file photo, Stephanie Rowell and her daughter Sydney, 5, shop at Toys R Us - Town Center in Kennesaw, Ga. Holiday shopping procrastinators can breathe easy. Yes, most online shipping deadlines have passed. But many retailers are offering other ways to get gifts at the last minute, whether it¿s staying open through the wee hours of the night like Toys R Us, or offering Christmas Eve store pickup like Wal-Mart. (Hyosub Shin/Atlanta Journal-Constitution via AP, File) Many stores are extending their hours in the days leading up to Christmas. Toys R Us will stay open from 6 a.m. on Dec. 23 straight to 9 p.m. on Christmas Eve, while department store Kohl's will stay open from Dec. 20 until Christmas Eve. Certain Macy's department stores will be open all night between Dec. 22 and Dec. 23. Sears will close at midnight through Dec. 23 and close at 6 p.m. on Christmas Eve. And Target will be open from 7 a.m. to midnight through Dec. 23 and stay open until at least 10 p.m. on Christmas Eve. SHOP THE UNEXPECTED If you can't make it to the mall, a quick stop at a drug or specialty store might work. CVS, Walgreens and Rite Aid are increasingly stocking their shelves with more toys for the little ones. And those three drugstores also have a big selection of plastic gift cards for use at other stores, such as video game retailer GameStop or bookseller Barnes & Noble. Meanwhile, office supplies store Staples sells flying drones and adult coloring books. And Dick's Sporting Goods has Apple Watches, headphones and GoPro cameras. STORE PICKUP If you want to avoid searching for items in the store, you're in luck. Many retailers let you buy items online and pick them up at a store the same day. After ordering and paying online, walk to a special section of the store with the confirmation email and ID and that's it. Macy's, Target and Best Buy are just some of the stores that offer store pickup. Wal-Mart says customers who order items before 6 p.m. on Dec. 23 can pick them up on Christmas Eve and even launched a website with the items that qualify at walmart.com/lastminutegifts. And at Sears.com, those who opt for store pickup between now and Christmas Eve can get 20 percent off clothing, jewelry and home goods if they type in a special promo code. SEND AN E-GIFT The websites of some major stores are offering a way to give an instant gift, called an e-gift. It's similar to a gift card, but is supposed to be a little more personal: You choose the item you want to buy — say sneakers or a sweater — click the "E-Gift" or "GiftNow" button, pay, and then the recipient gets an email telling them you bought them a gift. The gift receiver accepts it and can make adjustments, such as changing the color or size, before it ships. Or they can just get something else entirely from the store. The service carries no extra charges to the gift giver or receiver, and is available on several websites, including Saks Fifth Avenue, Nordstrom and Ralph Lauren. SAME-DAY DELIVERY It will cost you more, but if you're desperate, you can get some items delivered the same day you order them online. Macy's offers same-day delivery in some cities and so does Nordstrom. But be aware, some may not deliver on Christmas Eve, like Nordstrom. If you're an Amazon.com Prime member paying the annual fee, the online retailer is lets shoppers in Miami, New York and other cities order toys, electronics and other gifts as late as 9:45 p.m. on Christmas Eve for delivery in two hours, meaning you'll get it before midnight. OR JUST WAIT Procrastination may work in your favor if you end up not seeing a person you're shopping for until after Christmas. That's when after-holiday sales kick in, says Sara Skirboll, a shopping and trends expert at shopping deal app RetailMeNot. If the timing works, you'll likely pay less for a gift than you would if you had bought it before the holidays, says Skirboll. _____ Contact Joseph Pisani at http://twitter.com/josephpisani .

On Tuesday night, Wal-Mart said it would remove the shirts which say "Bulletproof" but not the "Black Lives Matter" shirts. "Black Lives Matter" is a slogan and protest movement that emerged after the death of Trayvon Martin in 2012 and police-involved slayings in 2014 and is seen as offensive by many in law enforcement. The website Breitbart.com posted an article last week that said that Wal-Mart was "selling Black Lives Matter clothing and other items," though the merchandise is actually being sold through Wal-Mart's website by Old Glory Merchandise, a music and entertainment apparel dealer out of Connecticut. VIDEOS TOP JOBS Chuck Canterbury, the FOP president, wrote Tuesday to Wal-Mart CEO C. Douglas McMillon to advise him that the Wal-Mart website was selling "offensive shirts and sweatshirts," and "I urge you to prohibit the use of the Wal-Mart name and website for the retail sale of these products." The Wal-Mart site and Old Glory's site also sell "Blue Lives Matter" shirts. Canterbury said he understood that a third party was selling the merchandise, but "I am concerned that allowing these articles to be sold in this way will damage your company's good name amongst FOP members and other active and retired law enforcement officers." Canterbury added, "Commercializing our differences will not help our local police and communities to build greater trust and respect for one another." In response, Wal-Mart said that, "Like other online retailers, we have a marketplace with millions of items offered by third parties that includes Blue Lives Matter, Black Lives Matter and All Lives Matter merchandise. After hearing concerns from customers, we are removing the specific item with the 'bulletproof' reference." The "bulletproof" shirts say "Bulletproof" with "Black Lives Matter" beneath that line.

Walmart has said it will pull shirts emblazoned with "Bulletproof: Black Lives Matter," but not those that read only "Black Lives Matter", from its website following a letter from the Fraternal Order of Police that called the shirts "offensive." The clothing was being sold by a third-party vendor on Walmart's website. Ted S. Warren/AP/File | Caption Ellen Powell @ellenrpowell December 21, 2016 —Walmart agreed to pull a Black Lives Matter shirt emblazoned with the word “Bulletproof” from its website, in a move that highlights the challenge facing retailers on social justice issues – as well as efforts by communities and police to promote unity while acknowledging criticism. The Fraternal Order of Police, the largest police organization in the country, had originally asked Walmart to pull two shirts from its website: the “Bulletproof” shirt, which reads “Black Lives Matter” in smaller font on a second line; and a shirt that reads simply “Black Lives Matter.” Both shirts are sold on Walmart’s website by a third-party vendor, Connecticut-based Old Glory Merchandise. In a letter on Tuesday, Fraternal Order of Police president Chuck Canterbury told Walmart CEO C. Douglas McMillon that the shirts were “offensive” and "profiting from racial division." For the Fraternal Order of Police, the T-shirt encourages community division and even violence, and it detracts from efforts to sow cooperation between police and the communities they serve, Mr. Canterbury argued. But others suggest that Black Lives Matter is a peaceful movement that, by calling attention to a history of differential treatment, has an important role to play in forging unity going forward.  “Those who use the phrase do not advocate violence,” writes Shawn Alexander, a professor of African and African-American studies at the University of Kansas, in an email to The Christian Science Monitor. Efforts to paint Black Lives Matter as violent or divisive, he adds, seek to “cover up the troublesome truth of America’s racist past and how that history continues to live and [affect] us today.” The Black Lives Matter movement emerged after the death of teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012. Since then, it has been working to advocate for black Americans: In August, the movement released a six-part platform aimed at addressing historical grievances.  How well do you know #BlackLivesMatter? Take the quiz. According to Professor Alexander, the phrase “Black Lives Matter” – and the movement associated with it – highlight “the irrefutable fact that historically black lives have not mattered, or have not been valued in the same manner as white lives.” But Black Lives Matter has drawn criticism from law enforcement officials, who may see it as an affront to their daily efforts to protect their communities. After police union members said they felt Walmart was selling anti-police clothing, the Fraternal Order of Police decided to ask the company to remove those items from their website, said Jim Pasco, executive director of the Fraternal Order of Police, the Washington Post reported. “Commercializing our differences will not help our local police and communities to build greater trust and respect for one another,” Canterbury wrote in Tuesday’s letter, posted on the Washington Post's website. For Walmart, the solution has been a compromise of sorts. The company decided to pull the “Bulletproof” shirt, while allowing vendors to continue selling Black Lives Matter shirts. Also available from third-party vendors on Walmart’s website are shirts for Blue Lives Matter, an organization that “seeks to honor and recognize the actions of law enforcement” and encourage public support for law enforcement, as well as All Lives Matter. Across the country, Black Lives Matter activists and local police forces have been finding ways to share their experiences and improve their understanding of others’ perspectives.  After a peaceful march in Wichita, Kansas in July, local activists met with Police Chief Gordon Ramsay and decided to cancel their next march in favor of a free community cookout. One officer, Lt. Travis Rakestraw, sat with three men, including Hispanic student Ivan Ray. The way Ray looked at police violence through the lens of other social issues was illuminating, Lt. Rakestraw said, according to the Associated Press. In August, National Night Out brought together neighbors and police officers. With the air of a traditional community get-together, the event was intended to forge unity between citizens and law enforcement. “With the climate in the past two years, it’s extremely important that we celebrate National Night Out to show the unity among each other,” Washington, D.C. assistant police chief Diane Groomes told the Monitor’s Nicole Orttung. “The only way to get beyond the divisions is to become honest with the history,” says Alexander.  Not everyone agrees that Black Lives Matter is doing that: Carol Swain, a professor at Vanderbilt Law School, told CNN's Michael Smerconish that the organization is “not really addressing the real problems affecting African-Americans.” Follow Stories Like This Get the Monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox. Sign-Up × But others say the movement’s efforts have already made a difference.  "Black Lives Matter has done more to move the needle on reforms in the criminal justice system than elected officials and community leaders all over this country,” countered civil rights attorney Areva Martin on the same CNN program.

The employee, a 16-year-old girl, suffered redness on the left side of her face and neck. She said the woman yelled at her before throwing the drink. She described the woman as being 19-20-years-old and pregnant and said she had several children with her. Theft, Warrensville Center Road: A Cleveland girl, 16, was arrested at Walmart Dec. 15 for the theft of multiple jewelry items, valued at a total of $42. She told officers she had the money to pay for the items but experienced a temporary lapse of reason and thought she could get away without paying for them. Endangering child, Warrensville Center Road: Officers found a vehicle in the Walmart parking lot at 9:18 p.m. Dec. 12 that was occupied by just three children between the ages of three and eight. When their mother returned to the car, she told officers she was only inside the store for five minutes to use the bathroom. Another woman returned to the car with her and had a cart full of items from the store. They asked her if she went into the store with the mother, but she would not answer. The mother, a 28-year-old Cleveland woman, was cited for endangering children. It was later learned through surveillance video that she and the other woman were in the store for over an hour. Weapons offense, Sheffield Road: A man reported Dec. 13 a neighbor had accidentally fired a gun and the bullet came into his house and through a bed's headboard. He said the man came over and apologized for the misfiring that occurred while he was in his attic. Officers spoke to the neighbor, who said he pulled the trigger to de-cock it, not realizing there was a round in the chamber. The man, 23, was cited for discharging firearms. Theft, Princeton Boulevard: A man, 77, reported Dec. 13 four checks were fraudulently issued from his bank account to the son of a woman who cleans his home. He said it would have been easy for the Euclid woman, 46, to take the checks because he does not supervise her while she is cleaning. He asked to press charges against her and her 31-year-old son. A check of their criminal history showed charges ranging from check fraud to forgery and passing bad checks. General assistance, Monticello Boulevard: A man, 54, said Dec. 1 he had five iPhones stolen from him by a man and his brother after they gave him a ride to the University Heights Target store to buy them. He said an altercation occurred between them when they arrived back at his house and the men left with the phones that he had bought for $224 each. Officers told him to return to Target to obtain receipts as proof that he had bought them. Subsequently, officers spoke with a Target employee and learned the man did return to the store, but caused a disturbance and was since banned from the store. The employee also believed the man was involved in a phone buying scam, in which the phones are bought for a penny plus a small activation fee and then sold by the buyer, who claims they were stolen and requests the accounts be closed. They said the man purchased a total of four phones, two for $52 each and two for $60 apiece. Officers spoke with the man again and he claimed he bought them for his new business and was going to give two of them to employees, which were the two men that drove him to Target. He said they were not trustworthy though and he fired them while being driven home from Target. He denied buying them to sell them and said he did not know the last names of the two men or where they lived. Recovered property, Stonehaven Road: A man reported Dec. 6 a vehicle was parked in the driveway at his father's home and nobody knew who it belonged to or how it got there. Officers learned it was reported stolen out of Lakewood and advised officers from that city so they could notify the owner. The vehicle had no visible damage and the key was inside of it. Theft, Warrensville Center Road: A Cleveland man, 21, was stopped for shoplifting at Walmart Dec. 6 after he asked an employee to push a cart, containing two TVs and two other items, to his car. He told officers he had been shot in the past year and as a result was still in need of medical attention. His arm was in a sling and major scarring and stitches were visible. Due to his medical condition, he was cited for the $835.80 theft and released. Theft, Parkside Boulevard: A woman said Dec. 12 her granddaughter, 15, used her bank account fraudulently to charge $278 worth of Uber and Lyft rides for herself and her boyfriend. She said she had already filed unruly juvenile charges against her in juvenile court and needed a report for her bank's fraud department. Traffic offense, Mayfield Road: The driver of a vehicle refused to identify herself and said she never had a driver's license after officers pulled her vehicle over around 1 a.m. Dec. 16 for not having its headlights illuminated. Inside the vehicle was suspected marijuana and an open bottle of cognac. The driver was subsequently identified as a 17-year-old University Heights girl and is facing charges in juvenile court for open container, drug abuse, curfew and no operator's license. Breaking and entering, Warrensville Center Road: The rear door to a vacant business was found to have been kicked in Dec. 11. The glass on the door had previously been damaged and replaced with plywood. There was nothing missing from inside the business, but there was a mattress there that had not been there previously. There were no witnesses to the incident. Theft, Warrensville Center Road: A Walmart employee was cited for theft at the store Dec. 11. The Cleveland woman, 20, admitted to label switching and taking unpaid deli items. She said she took about $200 worth of food items over the past several months.

BUSINESS Wal-Mart removes 'Bulletproof: Black Lives Matter' shirts after police complaint Black Lives Matter Matt Mills McKnight / European Pressphoto Agency Protesters carry a "Black Lives Matter" banner as they march through downtown Seattle in November. Protesters carry a "Black Lives Matter" banner as they march through downtown Seattle in November. (Matt Mills McKnight / European Pressphoto Agency) Tom Jackman Wal-Mart has agreed to remove T-shirts and sweatshirts that say “Bulletproof: Black Lives Matter” from its website after a complaint from the president of the country's largest police organization, but the retailer said it would not remove those that say only “Black Lives Matter.”  "Black Lives Matter" is a slogan and protest movement that emerged after a neighborhood watch volunteer killed unarmed teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 and intensified amid later police-involved deaths. Some law enforcement groups have accused it of being anti-police. The website Breitbart.com posted an article last week that said Wal-Mart was "selling Black Lives Matter clothing and other items," though the merchandise is actually being sold through Wal-Mart's website by Old Glory Merchandise, a music and entertainment apparel dealer out of Connecticut. Chuck Canterbury, president of the national Fraternal Order of Police, wrote to Wal-Mart Chief Executive C. Douglas McMillon on Tuesday to tell him the Wal-Mart website was selling "offensive shirts and sweatshirts." "I urge you to prohibit the use of the Walmart name and website for the retail sale of these products," Canterbury wrote.   The Wal-Mart site and Old Glory's site also sell shirts that say "Blue Lives Matter," a slogan that emerged to highlight the importance of law enforcement officers. Black Lives Matter activists have said the "blue lives" versus "black lives" debate obscures the point of their movement — which has expanded to focus on historical and modern-day discrimination and racial inequality that has plagued black Americans — and ignores police who have supported the movement. Canterbury said that he understood that a third party was selling the merchandise, but that he was "concerned that allowing these articles to be sold in this way will damage your company's good name amongst FOP members and other active and retired law enforcement officers." Canterbury added: "Commercializing our differences will not help our local police and communities to build greater trust and respect for one another." Wal-Mart issued a statement Tuesday night saying: "Like other online retailers, we have a marketplace with millions of items offered by third parties that includes Blue Lives Matter, Black Lives Matter and All Lives Matter merchandise. After hearing concerns from customers, we are removing the specific item with the 'bulletproof' reference." The "bulletproof" shirts say "Bulletproof," with "Black Lives Matter" beneath that line. Old Glory did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Walmart is dropping the online sale of T-shirts and hooded sweatshirts bearing the message “Bulletproof: Black Lives Matter,” it announced Tuesday night, following a complaint from the country’s largest police organization. The national Fraternal Order of Police had called the message “offensive” in a letter to the giant retailer earlier that day. The 325,000-member organization has since issued a similar letter to Amazon complaining about the same products, as well as about shirts and sweatshirts bearing the words “Hands Up, Don’t Shoot.” “Commercializing our differences will not help our local police and communities to build greater trust and respect for one another. Turning a buck on strained relationships will not contribute to the healing process,” FOP President Chuck Canterbury wrote to Walmart CEO C. Douglas McMillon. Canterbury told McMillon that he was “concerned” that selling the shirts would “damage your company’s good name” among FOP members, as well as among other “active and retired law enforcement officers.” Shortly afterward, Walmart issued a statement to The Washington Post announcing it was dropping the products because of “customer complaints.” It will continue to sell other products bearing the words “Black Lives Matter.” “Like other online retailers, we have a marketplace with millions of items offered by third parties that includes Blue Lives Matter, Black Lives Matter and All Lives Matter merchandise. After hearing concerns from customers, we are removing the specific item with the ‘bulletproof’ reference,” said the statement. The “Bulletproof” shirts were being sold through the Walmart website by third-party vendor Old Glory Merchandise, which was not immediately available for comment. On Wednesday, Canterbury sent a similar letter to Amazon and its CEO, Jeffrey Bezos ― who also owns The Washington Post. “Because I believe you share the FOP’s goal of increasing the bonds of trust between the men and women of law enforcement and the communities they serve, I wanted to let you know that my members are very upset that you and Amazon are complicit in the sale of this very offensive merchandise,” Canterbury wrote to Bezos. Black Lives Matter merchandise on Amazon’s site comes from several different third-party sellers. Shirts saying “Hands Up, Don’t Shoot” were still available on the site Wednesday. “Bulletproof: Black Lives Matter” shirts were not for sale. Amazon was not immediately available for comment. The Fraternal Order of Police has clashed frequently with the Black Lives Matter movement, which was born when Trayvon Martin’s killer was acquitted in 2013 and has been fueled by the deaths of other black men at the hands of police. The FOP has claimed that the movement is anti-police and places officers’ lives in danger. Last year it began to push for classifying attacks on police officers as hate crimes.

That’s what three Virginia Walmart stores did.” The ad, which is helmed by Making Change at Walmart, a campaign funded by the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, expands on claims the union made two weeks ago. Both then and now, the union says three Walmarts, including two in Hampton Roads, Virginia, barricade hair-care products marketed toward African-Americans in plastic security packaging, while leaving similar products disproportionately solicited to white customers undisturbed and within easy reach. Video segments in the commercial seem to support this claim; however, The Virginian-Pilot asserts only one of the cited stores actually uses the protective measures mentioned in the ad. When contacted by the paper, a Walmart rep wrote the protective packaging was part of a “normal” practice to minimize theft of at-risk items. The incident arrives on the heels of another Walmart controversy, where Black Lives Matter T-shirts were pulled from the store’s virtual shelves. Currently, the megastore sees no wrongdoing in the security measures, designating the discriminatory claims as “false and offensive.” The Virginian-Pilot Tags: beautywalmarthairhairy situations Share on Facebook Tweet this Story Top StoriesCarrie Fisher’s Urn Might Be a Big Prozac PillWill Vitamin C Cure My Cold?Condé Nast Staffers Staged a ‘Fashion Protest’ During Trump’s Visit Most Viewed Stories Republicans Confirm Planned Parenthood Will Lose Federal Funding As Soon As Next Month Both Sides of a Breakup: Their Open Marriage Still Makes Him Want to Vomit Can Anyone Spot What’s Wrong With This Newspaper Cover on the Women’s March on Washington?

Orders have been placed by over 300 growers supplying Walmart with a variety of fresh produce items. “Walmart chooses to use Wood Grain RPCs to deliver produce for a variety of reasons,” said Shawn Baldwin, SVP Produce, Floral, Global Food Sourcing, Walmart USA. “They have better ventilation, they’re ergonomically designed and very easy to use. And, our customers really like the new Wood Grain RPCs because they look more like a farmers market or roadside fruit stand which provides a level of comfort during the shopping experience.” “We are proud to partner with Walmart and its fresh produce suppliers to provide them with innovative, efficient, cost-effective and sustainable reusable packaging that transitions easily to in-store display,” said Daniel Walsh, President of IFCO North America. “Surpassing the 11 million Wood Grain RPC threshold so quickly is an impressive accomplishment made possible through strong collaboration between Walmart, the grower community and IFCO.” To learn more about IFCO and the Wood Grain RPC click here Worldwide Business IFCO Interview. IFCO Wood Grain RPCs are used to ship fresh produce to Walmart under an agreement reached with the world’s largest retailer in October, 2015.

IFCO has a strong commitment to supporting local economies, local companies and local workers in the marketplaces where it does business whenever possible. In the United States, IFCO’s Wood Grain RPCs are 100% sourced and manufactured in America and meet the Federal Trade Commission’s standard for its “Made in the USA” country of origin label.

The confrontation came after he asked a woman about items that may have been stolen. The incident occurred Tuesday night at the Walmart in Whitehaven at 5255 Elvis Presley Boulevard. The suspect, 35-year-old Kawanzaa Hutson, was arrested and released on an assault charge. A police report indicates the exchange between Hutson and the off-duty deputy got violent. The report states the deputy approached Hutson over items that were potentially stolen, and Hutson got angry, hitting the 54-year-old officer on the hand and upper body. It's unclear if any of the items were actually stolen. Investigators said Walmart surveillance cameras caught the attack. "If it's dangerous for the police; it's dangerous for everybody," said Michael Hines, who was shopping at the store Wednesday. A week and a half ago, a Memphis Police officer working security for bass Bass Pro Pyramid was knocked out cold by a suspected shoplifter running out with ammo. Shopper Debra Allen said the physical violence in the Walmart situation is terrifying. "It's very scary. If they would hurt somebody like that, what about me, my kids.. no respect," she said. WMC Action News 5 reached out to Kawanzaa Hutson and went to her last known address, and she was not there. She called our newsroom and left a number, but we've been unable to reach her despite multiple attempts. Copyright 2016 WMC Action News 5. All rights reserved.

Black Lives Matter."The national Fraternal Order of Police wrote to the retailer on Tuesday asking it to pull the shirts. Last week, an article on the right-wing web site Breitbart complained that Walmart dropped items that displayed the Confederate flag but still sold the "bulletproof" items. Walmart has agreed to stop selling t-shirts and hooded sweatshirts online that read “Bulletproof. Black Lives Matter.” The national Fraternal Order of Police wrote to the retailer on Tuesday asking it to pull the shirts. Last week, an article on the right-wing web site Breitbart complained that Walmart dropped items that displayed the Confederate flag but still sold the “bulletproof” items. Walmart (WMT) wasn’t actually selling the “Bulletproof. Black Lives Matter.” clothes itself, but they were available for purchase on its website via a third-party merchant. “Like other online retailers, we have a marketplace with millions of items offered by third parties that includes Blue Lives Matter, Black Lives Matter and All Lives Matter merchandise,” said a Walmart spokesman. “After hearing concerns from customers, we are removing the specific item with the ‘bulletproof’ reference.” Walmart’s move satisfied the police union, which does not object to the phrase “Black Lives Matters” by itself, according to James Pasco, the group’s executive director. “The bulletproof thing goes to the new assertiveness of some violence prone individuals to take action directly against police. We find it offensive for that reason,” said Pasco. Pasco added that the police union had yet to reach out to the third party vendor, Old Glory, that sells the bulletproof items. But Old Glory owner Glenn Morelli said he’s already decided to take down the shirt from his site as well. “It wasn’t a big seller at all. The Blue Lives Matter sells more than the Black Lives Matter or bulletproof shirts combined,” Morelli said. “We don’t like to offend anybody.” He said his company offers more than 500,000 different kinds of shirts and sweatshirts on its site. “When you sell that many, you have to sell all different kinds of shirts,” he said. “It’s hard to make everybody happy.” Filed in: News Suggest a correction × Suggest A Correction Your name Your email Report a typo or grammatical error Cancel Share this: Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest LinkedIn Email Adventure Arkansas Check the latest 5NEWS adventure.

The website Breitbart.com posted an article last week that said Wal-Mart was “selling Black Lives Matter clothing and other items,” though the merchandise is actually being sold by Old Glory Merchandise, a music and entertainment apparel dealer out of Connecticut. Chuck Canterbury, the FOP president, wrote to Wal-Mart CEO C. Douglas McMillon Tuesday to advise him that the Wal-Mart website was selling “offensive shirts and sweatshirts,” and “I urge you to prohibit the use of the Wal-Mart name and website for the retail sale of these products.” The Wal-Mart site and Old Glory’s site also sell “Blue Lives Matter” shirts. Canterbury said he understood that a third party was selling the merchandise, but “I am concerned that allowing these articles to be sold in this way will damage your company’s good name amongst FOP members and other active and retired law enforcement officers.” Canterbury added, “Commercializing our differences will not help our local police and communities to build greater trust and respect for one another.” Wal-Mart and Old Glory did not respond to requests for comment Tuesday evening.

Donell Barron and Rikki Hart,  both 34, were arrested Sunday outside the store in Greenacres, Florida, according to the Palm Beach Post.  An arrest report says the deputy looked inside the Toyota after detecting a strong odor 'similar to that of homeless camps.'  Barron told the deputy the family lost their home and lived in motels until they ran out of money two months ago. Scroll down for video  Donell Barron (left) and Rikki Hart were arrested after five children were found living in a Toyota in a Wal-Mart parking lot in Florida He also told the deputy the kids bathed at a nearby park. The children are ages 14, 8, 6, 5 and 4. The police report blocked out the relationship between the couple and the children. Authorities say the children are underweight, but the 14-year-old boy's bones 'were clearly visible.' He reportedly only weighed five pounds more than his eight-year-old sibling and had unusually high blood pressure. An officer said he smelled a stench like a 'homeless camp' inside the car when he found the children, who were malnourished  Deputies said the children only ate bread and salad once a day and had not seen a doctor in years.  Unlike the children, the report said that the couple seemed healthy and clean. The pair had been evicted  twice in the past five years from homes in Port St. Lucie in for failure to pay rent.  The pair run a blog that purports to offer healthy eating services as well as a budget, saving and investment program The couple have a blog called Holistically Beautiful for 'those interested in a holistic and balanced lifestyle.' On the blog, Barron says he has a 'Master's Degree in Rehab Science/Substance Abuse' and Hart says she has her 'Bachelor's is [sic] Speech Communication and has a background in Banking, Dance Therapy, Childbirth Preparation.' Hart's LinkedIn page says she graduated from Clarion University in Pennsylvania. Barron reportedly told cops that he was Native American and 'is not property of the US or any corporation.'  Despite their history of failure to pay rent, the couple offer a 'Money Matters Initiative Program' that offered recipients counseling on budgeting and investing.

Share this article Share They also offer a program on eating healthy. Additionally, Hart says she is a doula. 'As a wife and a mother of 5 children, I understand the importance of having support while being pregnant and through the childbirth process,' she wrote on LinkedIn. The Department of Children and Families took custody of the children. The report doesn't say whether Baron and Hart have lawyers. They face charges of child neglect and are being held in Palm Beach County Jail in lieu of $1,000 bail.        Read more: Five malnourished children found living in car at Walmart cbs12.com/news/l...

Its final decision? Ceasing investing city tax dollars in all corporate bonds. At least for a few months. In a somewhat dramatic turn (and amid a reluctance among city council members to stand specifically against some companies) the council promptly turned what was supposed to be a hearing on several corporate bad actors into a decision to direct the city's treasurer to cease corporate investments altogether. The move was partly choreographed—advocates pushing for divestment from private prisons had been told of a deal before this afternoon's hearing. And the decision neatly allowed the city council to sidestep singling out companies like Wells Fargo and Caterpillar, which community members have pressed especially hard be put on the city's "Do Not Buy" list. Those two companies were among a list of nine corporations that a city committee recommended Portland officials rule out for tens of millions in city investments. Others included Walmart, Credit Suisse, and JP Morgan Chase. Last month, the Mercury examined the push to divest from Wells Fargo because of its role in funding private prison companies. Headed into this afternoon's hearing, it looked like most of those companies wouldn't be added to the Do Not Buy list. After a hearing on November 30, Commissioner Steve Novick had introduced a resolution that would have placed Credit Suisse, Nestlé, and Walmart on the list (pending council approval). Last Friday, Novick told the Mercury those were the companies he felt were most defensible to have on the list. (Novick noted that only around 50 companies issue bonds that meet Portland's strict criteria for investment, and that adding nine of them to the list would have meaningfully cut the city's options.) But something changed. At the outset of this afternoon's hearing, Novick introduced an amendment that would add Wells Fargo and Caterpillar to the list (Caterpillar was a target for its role selling weaponized bulldozers to Israel, which uses them to raze settlements in the West Bank). Then Fritz introduced another amendment directing City Treasurer Jennifer Cooperman "to suspend direct investments of cash assets in corporate debt securities" until council had adopted another investment policy next year. "You’ve won," Fritz told people who'd come to speak at the hearing—many of them pressing divestment in specific corporations. "We aren’t going to invest in things you don’t like." That message wasn't readily embraced by folks in the crowd for a couple reasons. First: Fritz's amendment doesn't forever preclude the city from investing in corporate bonds. Rather it directs the treasurer to amend the city's investment criteria to ensure corporations meet "a to-be-determined minimum rating at the time of purchase," as determined by an "environmental-, social- and governance-based investment research provider." Since no one knows what that rating will be, no one can conclusively say Walmart or Credit Suisse or Wells Fargo would be disqualified. "Let’s not repeat work that’s already been done," said Jamie Trinkle, a research coordinator with the group Enlace, which has pushed divestment from Wells Fargo. "What you’ve set in motion is powerful and visionary, but it's not worth the paper it's written on if you don’t implement it." More pressing for folks in the audience: By applying to all corporations, Fritz's amendment didn't end up slapping the wrist of very specific corporations that might be doing wrong. "Saying we’re not going to buy any companies is very different from singling out the worst of the worst," one woman told city council. Council wasn't moved, declining to add the companies Novick had put forward for the Do Not Buy list and instead unanimously ordering that the city stop purchasing corporate securities (that move doesn't have any bearing on corporate investments that have yet to mature). "We really need to be very careful about how we move forward," Fritz said. Of course, the decision will come at a cost. Cooperman, the city treasurer, told council the city makes between $4.5 million and $5 million more via corporate investments each year than it would investing in lower yield products (like treasury bonds). Cooperman plainly did not like this solution (even though the city didn't invest in corporate bonds until 2009). When asked by Commissioner Nick Fish whether ceasing buying corporate bonds for a time might present less risk, she batted the suggestion aside. "There is an opportunity lost by not investing in something Oregon state law allows us to do," she said. The decision created a situation where Novick's last vote as a city commissioner somewhat undid one of his earlier efforts. He was the person who suggested the city develop a socially responsible investment policy, with a citizen committee that helped identify bad actors. Under Fritz's amendment, that process will be effectively automated, eliminating the need for a committee, according to Fritz's office. "As far as I know, this is unique in the country," Novick said before casting his vote, noting that while other cities might have blanket policies, they hadn't adopted "specific criteria" for not investing in companies. "We’ve learned why they don’t," he said. "It’s hard." 1 Good Morning, News: Charlie Hales, Weed Delivery, and 911 Flaws Vice Is Ditching Comments, Too. Santa Must Be Real After All!

(Screenshot from Walmart website) Print Email Cliff Pinckard, cleveland.com By Cliff Pinckard, cleveland.com The Plain Dealer Email the author | Follow on Twitter on December 21, 2016 at 10:03 PM, updated December 21, 2016 at 10:06 PM comments CLEVELAND, Ohio -- Complaints from a nationwide police union prompted Walmart on Wednesday to remove T-shirts and sweat shirts for sale on its website that say "Bulletproof: Black Lives Matter." Chuck Canterbury, president of the Fraternal Order of Police, wrote an open letter on Tuesday night asking Walmart to remove "Bulletproof" items from its website, CBS News reports.  Canterbury wrote that Walmart has been supportive of police in the past, but said he worried having the items available would "damage your company's good name amongst FOP members and other active and retired law enforcement officers." "At a time of year when we as a nation and indeed, as a world, should be coming together in hopes of peace on Earth and goodwill toward men, these third-party sellers are profiting from racial division." According to the Los Angeles Times, the Black Lives Matter items are sold on Walmart's website by Old Glory Merchandise, a music and entertainment apparel dealer out of Connecticut. The dealer also sells "Blue Lives Matter" apparel. While Walmart has dropped the "Bulletproof" shirts, it will continue to allow items that say Black Lives Matter only, CNN reports. "Like other online retailers, we have a marketplace with millions of items offered by third parties that includes Blue Lives Matter, Black Lives Matter and All Lives Matter merchandise," a Walmart spokesman said, according to CNN. "After hearing concerns from customers, we are removing the specific item with the 'bulletproof' reference." James Pasco, the FOP's executive director, tells CNN the police union is satisfied with Walmart's action and does not object to Black Lives Matter by itself. "The bulletproof thing goes to the new assertiveness of some violence prone individuals to take action directly against police. We find it offensive for that reason," Pasco said. Glenn Morelli, the owner of Old Glory Merchandise, tells CNN the "Bulletproof" merchandise was not a big seller, saying Blue Lives Matter is a much more popular shirt.

NYC pols back vics suing Walmart over sale bullets used to kill BY Erin Durkin NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Wednesday, December 21, 2016, 10:43 PM facebook Tweet email Public Advocate Letitia James stood with eight other city politicians against Walmart for selling bullets to an underage man who used them to kill three people in Pennsylvania. (Alec Tabak/for New York Daily News) BY Erin Durkin NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Wednesday, December 21, 2016, 10:43 PM Public Advocate Letitia James and other city pols filed a brief that backed up victims suing Walmart for selling bullets used to kill three people. In an amicus brief filed this week, the officials argue Walmart should not be protected by a federal law that generally shields gun makers and sellers, because the store broke the law by selling the ammo to someone under 21. “Weak gun laws and irresponsible practices by gun makers and retailers have brought death and destruction across our country,” James said. “This court action will hold Walmart accountable for its negligence in the deaths of three innocent people.” The Pennsylvania case stems from the murders of three people last year, using bullets bought at Walmart by 20-year-old Robert Jourdain. The families charge Walmart failed to check the man’s age, even though it’s illegal to sell handgun ammo to people under 21, and he was visibly drunk at the time.

Liz Krueger and eight City Council members, who argue New York has a stake in the case because so many of the guns used to shoot people here come from out of state, especially Pennsylvania. An estimated 90% of guns recovered in New York City come from out of state — and 8% of guns used in crimes in the city from 2010 to 2015 were from Pennsylvania, according to the state attorney general. James and another group of city officials previously filed a brief in the case arguing that it should be heard in state court, instead of being moved to federal court as Walmart wanted. City pols argue the federal laws don't apply to parties who break the law and are found negligent. (CHARLES KRUPA/AP) The families won that motion and were able to sue in state court, but Walmart is now trying to get the case dismissed on the grounds they’re shielded by the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act. 'Witch' murdered in Pennsylvania Dutch country over hex The pols argue in the brief that that immunity does not apply to retailers that break the law and are found negligent, and that Walmart violated the Gun Control Act of 1968 by selling the bullets to an underage customer. "Walmart continues to extend its condolences to the families for their loss. The Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act limits lawsuits against sellers and manufacturers and doesn’t allow the claims raised against us in the plaintiffs’ complaint," said Walmart spokesman Randy Hargrove.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    Police have every right to be offended by Walmart's online sales of t-shirts and hooded sweatshirts that read "Bulletproof. Black Lives Matter," a former circuit judge and police officer argued Wednesday. In an interview on "The O'Reilly Factor," Alex Ferrer, former Florida circuit court judge and police officer, applauded Walmart's decision to stop the sales after the national Fraternal Order of Police argued "third party sellers are profiting from racial division." "If you are a police officer, of course you find it offensive.... I don't find Black Lives Matter to be offensive in any way or racist because they only focus on black lives or because they don't focus on black on black crime. … I disagree with their premise… [that] police officers are unfairly targeting African-Americans. That's that is simply not true. It's not supported by any FBI statistics." He added that by putting on the t-shirt, the implication is that "cops are all shooting us – here is a shirt that says bullet proof. That's why cops are offended by the t-shirt." Radio talk show host and journalist Jamila Bey argued the t-shirt flap was a "distraction from issues that really matter." "American citizens have the right to free speech," she added. "That also means that we have the right to buy shirts with inflammatory staples on them. When police are saying 'you can't say that, ' I've got a problem...."

NYC pols back vics suing Walmart over sale bullets used to kill BY Erin Durkin NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Wednesday, December 21, 2016, 10:43 PM facebook Tweet email Public Advocate Letitia James stood with eight other city politicians against Walmart for selling bullets to an underage man who used them to kill three people in Pennsylvania. (Alec Tabak/for New York Daily News) BY Erin Durkin NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Wednesday, December 21, 2016, 10:43 PM Public Advocate Letitia James and other city pols filed a brief that backed up victims suing Walmart for selling bullets used to kill three people. In an amicus brief filed this week, the officials argue Walmart should not be protected by a federal law that generally shields gun makers and sellers, because the store broke the law by selling the ammo to someone under 21. “Weak gun laws and irresponsible practices by gun makers and retailers have brought death and destruction across our country,” James said. “This court action will hold Walmart accountable for its negligence in the deaths of three innocent people.” The Pennsylvania case stems from the murders of three people last year, using bullets bought at Walmart by 20-year-old Robert Jourdain. The families charge Walmart failed to check the man’s age, even though it’s illegal to sell handgun ammo to people under 21, and he was visibly drunk at the time.

Liz Krueger and eight City Council members, who argue New York has a stake in the case because so many of the guns used to shoot people here come from out of state, especially Pennsylvania. An estimated 90% of guns recovered in New York City come from out of state — and 8% of guns used in crimes in the city from 2010 to 2015 were from Pennsylvania, according to the state attorney general. James and another group of city officials previously filed a brief in the case arguing that it should be heard in state court, instead of being moved to federal court as Walmart wanted. City pols argue the federal laws don't apply to parties who break the law and are found negligent. (CHARLES KRUPA/AP) The families won that motion and were able to sue in state court, but Walmart is now trying to get the case dismissed on the grounds they’re shielded by the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act. 'Witch' murdered in Pennsylvania Dutch country over hex The pols argue in the brief that that immunity does not apply to retailers that break the law and are found negligent, and that Walmart violated the Gun Control Act of 1968 by selling the bullets to an underage customer. "Walmart continues to extend its condolences to the families for their loss. The Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act limits lawsuits against sellers and manufacturers and doesn’t allow the claims raised against us in the plaintiffs’ complaint," said Walmart spokesman Randy Hargrove.

But activism is not really a part of its brand. Many were subsequently surprised to find Black Lives Matter gear on the retailer’s website. Customers browsing products on Walmart’s Marketplace, a digital store where third-party vendors can sell their goods through Walmart, were shocked to discover that the international retailer was carrying merchandise for the anti-police brutality movement Black Lives Matter. The slogans on the shirts range from a straightforward “Black Lives Matter” to a sweatshirt with the words “Bulletproof” written on the front. Old Glory, the third party vendor selling through Walmart’s website, provides a wide range of shirts with generic slogans thrown on them from “Girls just wanna have guns” to “OMG Becky,” “All Lives Matter,” “Bye Felicia” and even “Blue Lives Matter.” #Walmart warns workers not to use app helping them understand company's labor rules https://t.co/ImMDSyntSKpic.twitter.com/lrXTIqWj5V— RT America (@RT_America) November 15, 2016 Additionally, given that Old Glory’s business model appears to be centered around printing phrases on shirts that can be purchased cheaply in bulk, there is little connection between them and the Black Lives Matter movement. Blue Lives Matter, an organization for bolstering the image of law enforcement, complained that Walmart was stocking its shelves with Black Lives Matter merchandise, despite it only being available online through the third party vendor. Never the less, conservative twitter responded to the news that Black Lives Matter by making calls to boycott Walmart until it removes the offending garments from their non-existent shelves.

Suburbs Naperville Sun Naperville Crime Naperville man arrested for eighth time this year Nicholas Ducato Naperville Police Department / Handout Nicholas Ducato Nicholas Ducato (Naperville Police Department / Handout) Bill BirdContact ReporterNaperville Sun Privacy Policy A Naperville man has been arrested for the eighth time this year, his most recent charges related to shoplifting incident in which an employee of a local discount store was assaulted. Nicholas Ducato, 41, of the 800 block of Corday Avenue, has been arrested or ticketed at least 40 times since 1992 by area law enforcement agencies, according to DuPage County court records. Ducato, 41, lives in the 800 block of Corday Avenue, in the AMLI at Naperville apartment complex. He was most recently arrested at 10:15 a.m. Thursday, following an incident at the Walmart SuperCenter, at 2552 W. 75th St., according to his court file. In the most recent case, Ducato was confronted by a store security worker at the Walmart SuperCenter, 2552 W. 75th St., while allegedly trying to walk away with more than $500 worth of assorted, unspecified merchandise, records said. He threatened to harm the security worker, records said. Ducato also is charged with a Nov. 24 crime in which he allegedly "stole a number of power and hand tools" valued at just over $200 from a store, Naperville police Cmdr. Jason Arres said. Although Arres declined to name the business, a court file said it was the Walmart SuperCenter. Two of Ducato's other run-ins with the law this year occurred Jan. 25, according to court records. He allegedly took four cans of Red Bull energy drink from the Walgreens store at 1779 Sequoia Road and a buck hunting knife valued at $50 from the Menards home improvement center at 715 Fort Hill Drive. Ducato was arrested again March 20 on a charge of criminal trespass to property for allegedly going to the Walgreens after having been banned from the premises. He was charged again with same crime on July 14, when allegedly returning to the same store, records said. He also was arrested July 2 after trying to shoplift clothing, paint and a wire brush from the Menards store, records said. The most recent retail theft charge against Ducato is a felony. The other seven counts are misdemeanors. Ducato's court record includes a 1993 conviction for resisting or obstructing a police officer in Aurora; a 1995 conviction for battery in Naperville; separate 1995 convictions for trespassing in Naperville and Aurora; and a 2000 Downers Grove battery conviction. Ducato is being held in DuPage County jail on a combined bail of $4,750, according to jail records. He is scheduled to appear in court Dec. 27 in connection with the alleged Walmart crimes and on Jan. 11 in the earlier cases. wbird@tribpub.com Copyright © 2017, Naperville Sun Crime Theft Law Enforcement Naperville Questions about elite golf course on the South Side Food stamp program faces uncertain future Visiting Chicago Breaking Sports Trending Opinion Suburbs Entertainment Business Advertising 4°

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Tom Jackman December 20, 2016 Follow @TomJackmanWP A protester wearing a “Black Lives Matter” t-shirt in Minnesota last summer at a demonstration after the death of Philando Castile. Similar, but not identical, t-shirts and sweatshirts are being offered for sale on Walmart’s website. (Reuters/Eric Miller) UPDATE, Wed., 6 p.m.: The Fraternal Order of Police has now sent a similar request to Amazon.com. Amazon did not respond to a request for comment. ORIGINAL POST: The president of the national Fraternal Order of Police, the country’s largest police organization, on Tuesday asked Walmart to stop selling t-shirts and sweatshirts which say “Black Lives Matter” and “Bulletproof” on the department store’s website. On Tuesday night, Walmart said it would remove the shirts which say “Bulletproof,” but not the “Black Lives Matter” shirts. “Black Lives Matter” is a slogan and protest movement which emerged after the death of Trayvon Martin in 2012 and police-involved slayings in 2014, and is seen as offensive by many in law enforcement. The website Breitbart.com posted an article last week which said that Walmart was “selling Black Lives Matter clothing and other items,” though the merchandise is actually being sold through Walmart’s website by Old Glory Merchandise, a music and entertainment apparel dealer out of Connecticut. Chuck Canterbury, the FOP president, wrote to Walmart CEO C. Douglas McMillon Tuesday to advise him that the Walmart website was selling “offensive shirts and sweatshirts,” and “I urge you to prohibit the use of the Walmart name and website for the retail sale of these products.” The Walmart site and Old Glory’s site also sell “Blue Lives Matter” shirts. Canterbury said he understood that a third party was selling the merchandise, but “I am concerned that allowing these articles to be sold in this way will damage your company’s good name amongst FOP members and other active and retired law enforcement officers.” Canterbury added, “Commercializing our differences will not help our local police and communities to build greater trust and respect for one another.” Walmart issued a statement Tuesday night saying that, “Like other online retailers, we have a marketplace with millions of items offered by third parties that includes Blue Lives Matter, Black Lives Matter and All Lives Matter merchandise. After hearing concerns from customers, we are removing the specific item with the ‘bulletproof’ reference.” The “bulletproof” shirts say “Bulletproof” with “Black Lives Matter” beneath that line. Chris Kappelman, the head buyer for Old Glory, said Wednesday that Walmart had not contacted his company before removing some of their product. But he noted that Old Glory sells more than a half million shirts, including “All Lives Matter” and “All Matter Matters,” and they were not looking to offend anyone. He said they had removed the “Bulletproof” shirts from other third-party sites as well. Jim Pasco, the executive director of the police union in Washington, said the issue was raised by union members who felt Walmart was selling anti-police items. “There are a lot of people who feel too many guns are sold,” Pasco said. “Why not speak out against things that might be seen as fomenting violence, rather than things that commit violence?” Canterbury’s letter is below:   local true-crime Orlando Shooting Updates News and analysis on the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. post_newsletter348 follow-orlando false after3th false Please provide a valid email address.

HAVERHILL — A shopping trip to the Plaistow Walmart was like nothing these children had ever experienced before. One hundred children attending the after-school care program at the YMCA in Haverhill got an early Christmas present from the owners of a chain of Dunkin' Donut shops. They were told they could select gifts at the Plaistow Walmart for themselves, or for anyone they wished, just as long as they left the store happy and smiling. "This is really exciting," said Rylee Spear, 9. "When my mother takes me here I see all the toys and I wish I could get one, but she usually tells me we are just there to get soap or something like that." The Cafua Family Charitable Foundation, the charitable arm of the Methuen-based Cafua Management Company, the largest privately owned Dunkin’ Donuts franchisee in the U.S., helped spread holiday cheer by presenting each child with $100 Walmart gift cards. Company owners, brothers Mark, David and Gregory Cafua told children they could buy whatever they wanted at the Plaistow Walmart, where they had arranged for a special shopping night on Monday. Mark Cafua said he and his brothers were particularly touched after learning about some of the children. "We have six children from one family who recently lost their father," he said. About 70 or so Cafua employees along with YMCA staff waited with shopping carts decorated with green and red helium balloons, and along with Santa Claus, welcomed the children as they disembarked two school buses.  From 4 to 6 p.m., each child was paired with a Cafua Management Company employee, with CEO Mark Cafua leading the charge and Y regional Executive Director Tracy Fuller and YMCA of the North Shore CEO Chris Lovasco joining in to lend a hand. "In my 20 years working for the nonprofit YMCA, this is one of the coolest ways to give back to the community," Lovasco said. The store's toy department began to swell with starry-eyed children, some of whom brought wish lists and had a good idea of what they wanted, while others marveled at everything on the shelves, but often had a hard time deciding on what to choose. Shopping carts rapidly filled with toys, such as Pokemon characters and Num Noms Art Cart playsets, which Ariela Jimenez, 8, picked out for herself.  "I'm also shopping for my mom and dad," Ariela said. Isaac Acevedo, 9, studied the image on a box of Lego pieces before his attention was drawn to Star Wars toys. "I like this," Isaac said about a foot-tall Darth Vader action figure he picked out.  Their adult shopping guides kept track of how much they had left on their gift cards. "I'm looking for fashion boots," Angela Tejada told her guide. Caleb Carroll, 7, selected a Five Night's at Freddy's plush cupcake along with two Yo-kai watches and accessories. "I never had $100 before," Caleb said. "I almost couldn't sleep last night thinking about coming here." While the other little shoppers were wandering from aisle to aisle, Isabella Lombard, 6, was trying out a bicycle with training wheels. "My bike is rusty and doesn't work very well," said Isabella, who noted that she was also in need of a bicycle helmet. Jyzaiah Ferreira, 12, reached for an XBox Live gift card for himself, then asked his adult shopping guide how much he would have left as he wanted to buy Christmas presents for his mother, father and younger brother. "This has never happened to me before," Jyzaiah said. "I was going to use my birthday money to buy presents, but now I can keep saving it." Samantha Ehlers, 7, asked her shopping guide if she had enough left to donate $35 to a charity after picking out a Disney Lion Guard Training Lair Playset, some Squinkies Do Drops characters and a Little Live Pets Tweet Talking Bird for herself, in addition to a Dinosaur Train character she planned to donate to the Toys for Tots program. "I want to donate to a charity, but I'm not sure which one," Samantha said. Some children wandered into the footwear and clothing departments, such as Ellie Cosme, 10, who was busy picking out a set of pajamas and slippers for herself while her younger brother Gabriel had just about finished filling a shared shopping cart with toys. "I was good all year and at my parent teacher conference, my mom said she was very proud of me," Ellie said before turning her attention to gifts she planned to get for her parents. Mark Cafua said his company operates about 300 Dunkin' Donut franchise locations throughout New England and Florida, including one on River Street near Westgate Plaza and another at 20 Plaistow Road, both in Haverhill. "The goal of our 100 for 100 program is to spread joy, especially to the youngest members of our communities, during this most special time of year," said Mark Cafua. "We truly value our partnership with the YMCA of the North Shore, as it has provided us with the opportunity to not only reach those most in need of Christmas cheer, but also to engage our employees in meaningful programs within their own communities." Cafua said that he and his brothers have hosted similar shopping sprees for deserving children in other states where they operate, but this was the first time for Haverhill.  He said his company partnered with the Plaistow Walmart as it was a good fit for the children, who had expressed interest in not only toys, but in clothing and household items many of them planned to give as gifts on Christmas. Fuller said the YMCAs mission and purpose as a community organization is to meet the ever-growing needs of individuals, children and families all year round. "The holidays are especially important as we explore additional ways to help those in need,” Fuller said. “We are so grateful for Cafua Management and this wonderful 100 for 100 event. We appreciate their incredible support of so many of our programs, including camp, road races, and our financial assistance program. Their generosity is a true testament to their commitment to joining us in strengthening the communities we serve.”  Leading up to the event, the children created wish lists during their Y after school program. Fuller said Walmart management was helpful in assisting the Y and Cafua teams to ensure a smooth and fun experience for everyone involved.

Vanne Alice Marie Heller No ATVs on Streets Hilbert to Replace School Roof Units Dedering Celebrates 102nd Birthday Fraud Case Stopped by CPD Dec 22, 2016Featured, News0 By Times Journal Staff Photo courtesy pixelbay A scammer with more than 150 credit cards was recently apprehended by the Chilton Police Department. The Chilton Police Department is currently working on an on-going investigation for more than a month involving major credit card fraud. “The same type of cases that happen in big towns also happen in small towns. It’s just not as frequent,” said Craig Plehn, chief of the Chilton Police Department. “Unfortunately most smaller town police departments do not have the man power, training, or time available to thoroughly investigate these types of cases. That’s why all Departments especially in this area have establish a good working relationship that we all can work together to solve these types of cases.” On Nov. 12 the Chilton Police Department received a call from a security advisor from a bank advising someone was currently at the Chilton Walmart buying $100 iTunes gift cards with stolen account information.  Officers responded to the Chilton Walmart, reviewed surveillance video and were able to give out the description of the suspect.  The suspect was stopped leaving Walmart and was found in possession of 170 credit cards, many without names just containing the magnetic strip and the security chip.  The suspect was also found to be in possession of a laptop computer and a card re-coder.  The suspect was also in possession of 34 iTunes gift cards totaling $3,400.  The complainant advised that the bank had lost over $20,000 in the last couple of days from individuals using stolen account information and purchasing iTunes gift cards.  The investigation has revealed that the suspect rented a car in North Carolina drove up to Wisconsin and hit numerous Walmart stores on the way to Chilton.  Search warrants have been done on the 168 credit cards and will be done on the laptop, iPhones and GPS to determine how many more stores were hit that the Chilton Police Department is not aware of.  The suspect has been charged with credit card theft, credit card forgery, credit card fraud, and eight counts of fraudulent use of credit cards.  Assisting the Chilton Police Department with this investigation was the Calumet County Sheriff’s Department, the Wisconsin Department of Criminal Investigations (DCI), the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI), and the Sheboygan County Sheriff’s Department.

Zoey was shopping with her family when Kociba surprised her with a gift, but she began crying when the Walmart cashier bagged the toy. Kociba came to the rescue and removed the dancing pink robot from the package. See page 2. BAD AXE — For the heroes, it’s a chance to give back to the community. For the young participants, it’s a chance to give to the ones they love. Area police, first responders, firefighters and other everyday lifesavers helped kids buy Christmas gifts during the annual Shop with a Hero program Thursday, Dec. 15 at Walmart. Event coordinator Dave Rothe, chief of the Bad Axe and Ubly police departments, said the first responders look forward to the yearly chance to help a child have a more joyful holiday. “The heroes who shop with the kids, they’re public servants. I think it’s second nature for them to want to help in any way they can. This is a great opportunity for them to do that,” he said. Harbor Beach Elementary School student Maria Potter reads her shopping list to Harbor Beach Firefighter Jason Lermont during Shop with a Hero. Photos by Kelly Krager This year, 56 children from area schools took part in the program, and 70 heroes showed up to help. Many heroes, Rothe said, opened their wallets to supplement the $50 each child received through the program. “That’s not unexpected, to see them do that. It’s part of who they are,” Rothe said. The Bad Axe Police Department collected approximately $2,500 in advance for this year’s program, and Rothe said he was given another $200 at Walmart during the event. Since there were too many volunteers to match each with a child, some heroes were given gift cards and were sent throughout the store to surprise children shopping with family. Clayton Galloway, 9, of North Huron Elementary School, shops in the toy aisle with Ubly Police Officer Matt Blaine. Bad Axe Fire Department Captain Justin Kociba helped 3-year-old Zoey Noaker, of Owendale, select and purchase a pink doll that sings and dances. “We’re just finding random kids and giving them a little Christmas present,” Kociba said. The program was also an opportunity for older students to learn the value of giving their time to benefit the community. Ascent High School Principal Russ Clark said the event was one of several the school’s students volunteer for during the year. “We always try to get them out of their little circle and little box, knowing that there are people who are worse off than they are themselves,” he said. The students also “adopted” nine families in the Bad Axe community, helping each have a more joyous holiday season. The Bad Axe Police Department accepts donations year round for the Shop with a Hero program. To donate to next year’s event, contact Rothe at 989-269-9242.

Fearless Muckraking Since 1993 Home Articles Recent Articles Magazine Current Issue Back Issues Subscribe Subscriber Access Subscribe Donate Archives Search Authors About JOIN LIST Books T-shirts podcasts FAQs December 22, 2016 The Scandal of Vast Inequality in Retirement Pay by Lawrence Wittner by Tweet Email Cato the Elder, a Roman senator and historian, once remarked:  “Cessation of work is not accompanied by cessation of expenses.”  For centuries, retirees have been aware of this unfortunate fact, which led them to demand and, in many cases, secure old age pensions to help provide financial security during their “golden years.”  But as indicated in a recently-released report by the Institute for Policy Studies (IPS), the financial security of retiring corporate CEOs is far, far greater than the financial security of average Americans. According to the extensively researched IPS report, A Tale of Two Retirements, 100 corporate CEOs possess company retirement funds totaling $4.7 billion―an amount equivalent to the entire retirement savings of 41 percent of U.S. families (50 million families, including 116 million Americans).  The retirement funds of these 100 CEOs are also equivalent to those of 75 percent of Latino families, of 59 percent of African-American families, of 55 percent of female-headed households, and of 44 percent of white working class households. Indeed, the top 100 CEO nest eggs, if averaged, would generate a $253,088 monthly retirement check to these 100 individuals for the rest of their lives.  By contrast, workers who had 401(k) pension plans at the end of 2013 had only enough in these plans to pay them an average monthly benefit of $101.  Of course, these were the lucky ones.  Among workers 56 to 61 years old, 39 percent had no employer-sponsored retirement plan at all, and would likely depend on Social Security, which pays an average of $1,239 per month, for retirement security. Of course, these are only averages.  When one looks at individuals, the contrasts are even starker.  Glenn Renwick, the Progressive Insurance Company’s CEO who retired in 2016, receives a monthly retirement check from his company for $1,035,733.  Among Walmart’s 1.5 million employees, fewer than two-thirds have a company-sponsored retirement plan and, if they do, it will pay them, on average, only $131 per month.  But Walmart’s CEO, Doug McMillon can expect to receive at least $360,000 per month―more than 2,700 times the amount a typical Walmart worker with a 401(k) account can expect.  And there’s also CEO David Cote of Honeywell―a company that has locked out its workers from its factories in Green Island, NY and South Bend, IN for seven months for rejecting a contract that eliminated workers’ pensions―who receives a monthly retirement check from the company for $908,712. Or take the case of John Hammergreen, CEO of the McKesson corporation, a drug wholesaling giant.  A few months after Hammergreen arrived at McKesson in 1996, the company froze its employee pension fund, closing it to workers who came there in 1997.  Even so, the company launched a lavish Executive Benefit Retirement Account that enriched Hammergreen’s pension with an average of $22,000 a day for the next 20 years.  Thus, today he receives a monthly retirement check from the company for $782,339. Things were not always like this.  From 1946 to 1980, a combination of union action and government policy led to the expansion of pension benefits for American workers.  By 1980, 46 percent of private sector workers were covered by defined benefit pensions.  But, in the following decades, declining union strength, corporate attacks on pension funds, and government action resulted in a severe erosion of worker retirement security.  By 2011, only 18 percent of private sector workers were covered by defined benefit plans. As demonstrated by the authors of the IPS report, the growth of economic inequality in retirement provisions resulted from rigging things in favor of CEOS through new rules for pensions, taxes, and executive compensation.   “Since more than half of compensation is now tied to the company’s stock price,” the authors note, “CEOs have a powerful personal incentive for slashing worker retirement benefits in order to boost the short-term bottom line.  Every dollar not spent on employee retiree security is money in the CEO’s pocket.” Although changes in public policy could close the widening pension gap, such changes do not seem likely to occur while a zealously pro-corporate party controls the White House, Congress, and the courts.  Indeed, as the authors point out, thanks to the shielding of enormous CEO income in tax-deferred accounts, Fortune 500 CEOs will see very substantial gains in their retirement checks if President Trump succeeds in implementing his plan to slash the top marginal income tax rate. It’s possible that, in the long run, the rising tide of retirement insecurity will spark a revolt challenging the severe economic inequality between corporate CEOs and their American workers.  Until then, however, it’s tempting to propose updating Jonathan Swift’s eighteenth century satirical suggestion, made in A Modest Proposal, that poverty among the poor might be alleviated by selling their babies as food for the rich.  Perhaps, in twenty-first century America, retirement insecurity might be alleviated by selling elderly workers to the corporate rich, who could use them for the burgers sold by their fast food companies.

You’ll receive free e-mail news updates each time a new story is published. You’re all set! Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Derek Hawkins December 22, 2016 The parents of a Florida woman found living in a car with her five children and their father told WPTV "she took care of" and loved her children, but they are not sure how the family got to this point. (WPTV) The deputy said he was on a routine patrol in Greenacres, Fla., Saturday morning when he spotted the blue Toyota in a Walmart parking lot. It wasn’t the look of the vehicle that caught his attention but the smell emanating from it — an odor “similar to that of homeless camps,” he said. Inside was a family of seven. The parents seemed healthy, police said, but their five children, ranging in age from 4 to 14, were filthy, fatigued and so malnourished that their bones were protruding from under their skin, according to WPTV. The oldest reportedly weighed a mere 50 pounds, just 5 pounds more than his 8-year-old sibling. The parents, Donell Barron and Rikki Hart, both 34, were arrested Saturday on charges of child neglect, according to WPTV. As of Wednesday evening, they were being held in the Palm Beach County Jail in lieu of $1,000 bail, the Palm Beach Post reported. It was not clear Wednesday if they had hired defense attorneys. The Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office told local media that the children, all of whom were described as “underweight,” were taken to a hospital, where at least one of them was treated for unusually high blood pressure. The five kids are now in custody of the Florida Department of Children and Families, the Palm Beach Post reported. Police said they took some of the children out to eat at McDonald’s, where they “ravenously ate the meals, as if they had not been fed in quite some time.” When interviewed by the sheriff’s office, Barron gave a grim account of how the family wound up living out of their car. According to the Palm Beach Post, Barron told police that they had been evicted from their home in Port St. Lucie about a year ago and had spent about 10 months hopping from one hotel to another before they ran out of money. They had lived in the car for the past two months, he told police, during which time they bathed in park bathrooms and urinated in a bucket they carried in the vehicle. Deputies reported that the children ate about once a day, their meals consisting mostly of salad and bread, and hadn’t seen a doctor in years, according to the Palm Beach Post. None of the children were enrolled in school, and instead were home-schooled inside the car, Barron told police. At times, Barron gave contradictory statements to deputies. First, he told them that he attended “three years of law school and practices law, but not as a lawyer,” according to a police report reviewed by WPTV. Later, he said he lost his money trading stocks and had never attended law school. He described himself as a Native American with a “corporate name” and said he was “not the property of the U.S. or any corporation,” the Palm Beach Post reported. Police told local media that Barron and Hart appeared to be clean and in good health at the time of their arrest. Richard Hart and Robin Johnson, identified by WPTV as Hart’s parents and the grandparents of the five children, told the station they had fallen out of touch with their daughter and didn’t know how the family ended up in such a state. They said she was once a homecoming queen and attended college on an academic scholarship. “Here I am sleeping in a comfortable bed and my babies had to be sleeping in a car all crammed up like that,” Richard Hart said. “She was a very loving parent. She was a very doting parent. She took care of her children. How we get to this point, that’s a question we can’t answer.” The Palm Beach Post reported that the couple ran a blog called “Holistically Beautiful” that they launched in 2014. The blog’s “about” page says Donell and Rikki Barron created the site “to show the benefits of living a healthier lifestyle and discuss topics which can enrich one’s life.” “They believe in the importance of living a balanced life and the importance of constantly improving oneself,” it says. A call to the number listed on the site went to a disconnected line and an email to the blog wasn’t immediately returned.

He and his fiancee searched at five stores to find a matching pair in their sizes. His determination paid off in a green sweater with a giant gingerbread man applique and candy-canestriped sleeves. “I’m wearing the only one that would fit me,” the 29-yearold from St. Paul, Minn., says. “We went to … Target, Wal-Mart and two Goodwills and all were nearly sold out. The guy at T.J. Maxx said if we could wait 90 minutes they were expecting a truck.” When the ugly sweater trend started, arguably about 15 years ago, hipsters were wearing over-the-top cardigans, mostly women’s, from the ’70s, ’80s and ’90s. Their popularity spread among thrift shops, surplus stores and vintage apparel shops. Now mainstream retailers have spotted an opportunity, as what once seemed like a fad refuses to fade. Their sweaters are newly made, not from the depths of someone’s closet, but the festive holiday styling is the same. “This could be a perennial favorite for years and years to come,” says Mary Van Note of Ginger retail consulting in Minneapolis. “It has incredible widespread adoption from kids, teens and suburban moms.” Wal-Mart has sold the ugly sweaters for three years, increasing its selection of holiday and novelty items by 40 percent this year. “Customers just can’t get enough of it, and the tackier the better,” says Deanah Baker, an apparel buying executive at Wal-Mart. There are online options as well. UglyChristmasSweater.com went from $40,000 in sales in its first year, 2012, to more than $5 million last year. James Perovich of Roseville, Minn., joined the ugly sweater club six years ago. At a singles party recently where everyone was encouraged to wear an ugly Christmas sweater, he wore his vintage red pullover that features black and plaid Scottish terriers high-stepping across his chest. Bright green pants from a Polo outlet store completed his impossible-to-ignore display. “My sweater is legit vintage,” he says. “Now they’re mass-producing them.” As mass merchandisers have stepped in with new, not used, sweaters to meet demand, they’ve also expanded the category. Novelty Christmas ball earrings, flashing brooches, green-and-red-striped socks, light-up Christmas tree hats, and Sexy Miss Santa gloves augment the sweater selection. But even the ubiquitous sweaters and slightly more sedate vests for men have evolved. This year, mass merchants are selling sweatshirts in large sizes to market to men who didn’t want to buy or couldn’t fit into the vintage sweaters that are mostly in women’s sizes. “Happy Llamakah” and “Meowy Catmus” sweatshirts provide an alternative to sweaters festooned in beads, bells and balls. Department stores added cheeky onesies, pajamas, Santa suits, hoodies and men’s suits in gaudy holiday themes. For the early adopter looking to make an indelible Christmas memory, the Oppo “Rudolph” covers the wearer from neck to ankle in a bright blue and red polyester suit imprinted with reindeer and snowflakes as big as cheese balls. Eddie Ocampo of Anoka, Minn., bought one last year at Opposuits.com. He wore it to a Christmas party for students at the University of St. Thomas School of Law last month. “It’s the fourth time I’ve worn it,” says the second-year law student. “I get reactions from open-mouthed stares to strangers who say, ‘Great suit.’” The kitschy Claus-wear is a cheap, convenient way to show holiday spirit. Most used sweaters cost less than $25 and even the new Oppo suits are less than $100. But more expensive sweaters have recently debuted from sources as varied as Whoopi Goldberg, Iron Maiden and the National Football League. Goldberg’s creations for $139 at Lordandtaylor.com include a brown Santa and an octopus with a candle in each of its eight arms. NFLshop.com created an ugly sweater, at $70, for each of the 32 teams in the league. Iron Maiden’s antidote for excessive holiday sentiment includes acrylic knitted images of skulls and barbed wire, for $85.

Black Lives Matter.” after complaints from the Fraternal Order of Police. CNN reports the national FOP wrote to Walmart on Tuesday and asked the retailer to pull the shirts. The items were available on Walmart’s website via third-party merchant Old Glory. “Like other online retailers, we have a marketplace with millions of items offered by third parties that includes Blue Lives Matter, Black Lives Matter and All Lives Matter merchandise,” said a Walmart spokesman, according to CNN. “After hearing concerns from customers, we are removing the specific item with the ‘bulletproof’ reference.” James Pasco, executive director of the FOP, said the police union does not object to the phrase “Black Lives Matter” itself. “The bulletproof thing goes to the new assertiveness of some violence prone individuals to take action directly against police. We find it offensive for that reason,” said Pasco. Old Glory owner Glenn Morelli said he took the shirt down from his site, as well. “We don’t like to offend anybody,” he said.

The non-violent movement with a simple message has been countered by rival slogans such as “All Lives Matter” and the pro-police “Blue Lives Matter.” The Fraternal Order of Police (FOP) is the country’s largest police union and they have taken their hatred of the phrase to a new level. The mega-retail giant Walmart was selling hooded sweatshirts and t-shirts with the words “Bulletproof. Black Lives Matter” online. In an article published on the alt-right website Breitbart, it was noted that Walmart stopped selling Confederate flags but it sells “Black Lives Matter” merchandise. The asinine commentary comparing the BLM movement to the traitorous, rebellious, violent and racist legacy of the Confederacy was ludicrous. However, it caused national FOP President Chuck Canterbury to send a letter to Walmart CEO Douglas McMillon. The letter states, “I urge you to prohibit the use of the Walmart name and website for the retail sale of these products,” calling the merchandise offensive. The BLM merchandise is provided by the clothing company Old Glory, which is a third party supplier that also makes “Blues Lives Matter” merchandise. Canterbury goes on to state in the letter, “I am concerned that allowing these articles to be sold in this way will damage your company’s good name amongst FOP members and other active and retired law enforcement officers.” Canterbury added, “Commercializing our differences will not help our local police and communities to build greater trust and respect for one another.” Apparently, Walmart caved and issued the following statement “Like other online retailers, we have a marketplace with millions of items offered by third parties that includes Blue Lives Matter, Black Lives Matter and All Lives Matter merchandise. After hearing concerns from customers, we are removing the specific item with the ‘bulletproof’ reference.” Jim Pasco, the executive director of the police union in Washington, is quoted as stating that the merchandise issue was raised by union members who felt Walmart was selling anti-police items. “There are a lot of people who feel too many guns are sold” Pasco said. “Why not speak out against things that might be seen as fomenting violence, rather than things that commit violence?” The Black Lives Matter movement has not called for violence at any of its rallies. It is a lie that continues to be spread by those who wish to silence the voice of protest from the Black community.

They waited until Black people spent their money for the holidays with them – then they found a conscious. What will be the response Black people? Will you arrive early to Walmart for their after Xmas sale? Stop financing your own oppression. You don’t need all that shit you buy anyway.

Markets Rex Tillerson’s $180 million severance package By Jonathan Berr MoneyWatch December 22, 2016, 5:30 AM Retailers go into 2017 with too many stores Comment Share Tweet Stumble Email Last Updated Dec 22, 2016 8:09 AM EST U.S. retailers have a problem they can’t easily resolve: They have too many stores. And even though they’ve already announced slews of store closings, it’s increasingly likely they’ll have to shutter even more over the next few years. That’s especially the case as consumers keep shifting their spending online, which has left the U.S. awash in unwanted retail space, or “overstored.” According to real estate information firm CoStar, nearly 1 billion square foot of retail space will be “rationalized” in the coming years through store closures and conversions to other uses. Many retailers also are seeking rent reductions as their productivity has slumped from an industry average of $330 in sales per square foot from $350 per square foot a decade ago. The level of “overstoring” may only get worse. Retail analyst Jan Rogers Kniffen expects about half of all retail sales to be online by 2030, a huge increase from current figure of about 10 percent. “A lot of these retailers are still in denial,” said Brian Yarbrough, a retail analyst at Edward Jones. “I think the Kohl’s (KSS), the J.C. Penneys (JCP) of the world, they’re in denial. At some point, there’s probably not a need for 2,400 Kohl’s and J.C. Penney’s across the United States. There’s probably not a need for 5,800 Walmart (WMT) Supercenters.” Play Video CBSN Amazon opens store without checkout line Amazon is opening a new brick-and-mortar store, but without a checkout line. CBSN's Elaine Quijano has more on the new smart grocery store. Officials from J.C. Penney didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment for this story. A Kohl’s spokesperson declined to comment beyond pointing to executive statements on earnings conference calls about “the importance of stores.” Walmart spokesman Randy Hargrove said the company doesn’t comment on analyst reports, but he noted that in October Walmart U.S. CEO Greg Foran said “next year you will see us put more capital allocation towards remodels versus new stores.” Hargrove added: “We still see a need for supercenters.” Another major chain facing significant overstored conditions is Sears Holdings (SHLD). The struggling retailer has been closing stores and unloading assets for years to bolster its finances. Here’s a closer look at how these chains are dealing with store closings. Macy’s (M) -- The country’s largest department store chain announced plans in August to shutter 100 underperforming locations in 2017, about 15 percent of its brick-and-mortar footprint. Macy’s shed 41 locations last year and axed thousands of employees. Terry Lundgren, who had led the retailer for more than a decade, will step down next year from the CEO spot and become executive chairman. Kohl’s -- After a rocky start to 2016 when it announced 18 store closures, the Wisconsin-based no-frills retailer rebounded and reported better-than-expected results in its most recent quarter. Kohl’s, though, continues to struggle. Comparable-store sales in its latest period fell 1.7 percent, the third straight decline in this closely watched retail metric of sales at stores open a year or more, a worrisome sign for Wall Street. J.C. Penney -- CEO Marvin Ellison made headlines in March that when he told Fortune he wouldn’t undertake “any wholesale closings of stores in its 1,020-location fleet,” though it did shutter seven locations. The Plano, Texas-based retailer operates almost as many stores as it did in 2006, but its annual sales were roughly $7 billion higher back then than they were last year. Ellison told the magazine that Penney’s future lies in e-commerce and physical stores working together. Walmart -- With cost pressures in mind, Walmart said in January that it would close 269 stores around the world, including its small-format Express locations that were designed to compete against the dollar stores that have taken market share from the giant in recent years. Rising expenses are weighing on the world’s largest retailer, which raised the salaries of thousands of hourly employees last year and unveiled a plan to spend billions on expanding its e-commerce operations Sears Holdings -- The Hoffman Estates, Illinois-based company has been floundering for years under the control of hedge fund tycoon Edward Lampert, who arranged the merger of Sears and Kmart that created the current company more than a decade ago.  This year it announced the shutdown of 68 Kmart stores and 10 Sears locations and accelerated the closing of 50 locations at the beginning of the year. Sears has indicated that more stores may be shuttered. “I am hard-pressed to imagine a scenario where Sears as constituted as anything we have known it will be around in 2018,” said Jason Ankeny, editor of Retail Dive, a trade news site. He added that the Sears and Kmart brands “don’t have any relevance and value for millennial consumers.” A Sears spokesman told CBS MoneyWatch critics underestimate the company. Said spokesman Howard Reifs: “We believe that we have sufficient resources to fund our transformation and meet all of our financial obligations.” The issue for all the big retail chains, however, remains a tough one: Just how many stores will they really need as shoppers increasingly put things into their shopping carts -- digitally. © 2016 CBS Interactive Inc..

Cato the Elder, a Roman senator and historian, once remarked: “Cessation of work is not accompanied by cessation of expenses.” For many centuries, retirees have been aware of this unfortunate fact, which led them to demand and, in many cases, secure old age pensions to help provide financial security during their “golden years.” But as indicated in a recently-released report by the Institute for Policy Studies (IPS), the financial security of retiring corporate CEOs is far, far greater than the financial security of average Americans. According to the extensively-researched IPS report, A Tale of Two Retirements, 100 corporate CEOs possess company retirement funds totaling $4.7 billion―an amount equivalent to the entire retirement savings of 41 percent of U.S. families (50 million families, including 116 million Americans). The retirement funds of these 100 CEOs are also equivalent to those of 75 percent of Latino families, of 59 percent of African-American families, of 55 percent of female-headed households, and of 44 percent of white working class households. Indeed, the top 100 CEO nest eggs, if averaged, would generate a $253,088 monthly retirement check to these 100 individuals for the rest of their lives. By contrast, workers who had 401(k) pension plans at the end of 2013 had only enough in these plans to pay them an average monthly benefit of $101. Of course, these were the lucky ones. Among workers 56 to 61 years old, 39 percent had no employer-sponsored retirement plan at all, and would likely depend on Social Security, which pays an average of $1,239 per month, for retirement security. Of course, these are only averages. When one looks at individuals, the contrasts are even starker. Glenn Renwick, the Progressive Insurance Company’s CEO who retired in 2016, receives a monthly retirement check from his company for $1,035,733. Among Walmart’s 1.5 million employees, fewer than two-thirds have a company-sponsored retirement plan and, if they do, it will pay them only $131 per month. But Walmart’s CEO, Doug McMillon can expect to receive at least $360,000 per month―more than 2,700 times the amount a typical Walmart worker with a 401(k) account can expect. And there’s also CEO David Cote of Honeywell―a company that has locked out its workers from its factories in Green Island, NY and South Bend Indiana for seven months for rejecting a contract that eliminated workers’ pensions―who receives a monthly retirement check from the company for $908,712. Or take the case of John Hammergreen, CEO of the McKesson corporation, a drug wholesaling giant. A few months after Hammergreen arrived at McKesson in 1996, the company froze its employee pension fund, closing it to workers who came there in 1997. Even so, the company launched a lavish Executive Benefit Retirement Account that enriched Hammergreen’s pension with an average of $22,000 a day for the next 20 years. Thus, today he receives a monthly retirement check from the company for $782,339. Things were not always like this. From 1946 to 1980, a combination of union action and government policy led to the expansion of pension benefits for American workers. By 1980, 46 percent of private sector workers were covered by defined benefit pensions. But, in the following decades, declining union strength, corporate attacks on pension funds, and government action resulted in a severe erosion of worker retirement security. By 2011, only 18 percent of private sector workers were covered by defined benefit plans. As demonstrated by the authors of the IPS report, the growth of economic inequality in retirement provisions resulted from rigging things in favor of CEOS through new rules for pensions, taxes, and executive compensation. “Since more than half of compensation is now tied to the company’s stock price,” the authors note, “CEOs have a powerful personal incentive for slashing worker retirement benefits in order to boost the short-term bottom line. Every dollar not spent on employee retiree security is money in the CEO’s pocket.” Although changes in public policy could close the widening pension gap, such changes do not seem likely to occur while a zealously pro-corporate party controls the White House, Congress, and the courts. Indeed, as the authors point out, thanks to the shielding of enormous CEO income in tax-deferred accounts, Fortune 500 CEOs will see very substantial gains in their retirement checks if President Trump succeeds in implementing his plan to slash the top marginal income tax rate. It’s possible that, in the long run, the rising tide of retirement insecurity will spark a revolt challenging the severe economic inequality between corporate CEOs and their American workers. Until then, however, it’s tempting to propose updating Jonathan Swift’s eighteenth century satirical suggestion, made in A Modest Proposal, that poverty among the poor might be alleviated by selling their babies as food for the rich. Perhaps, in twenty-first century America, retirement insecurity might be alleviated by selling elderly workers to the corporate rich, who could use them for the burgers sold by their fast food companies.

Matthew Mills posted a photo to Facebook, showing a car parked in two parking spaces at his local Walmart. To make matters worse, the car was taking up two handicapped spaces, and didn't even have a handicap placard. He decided to take matters into his own hands.

The Fraternal Order of Police wrote to Walmart CEO Doug McMillon on Tuesday, complaining that the store should not aim to profit off racial tensions in the US. 'Commercializing our differences will not help our local police and communities to build greater trust and respect for one another Turning a buck on strained relationships will not contribute to the healing process,' said the national FOP's president, Chuck Canterbury. Walmart has pulled all its 'Bulletproof: Black Lives Matter' shirts after police deemed them 'offensive' 'This should be a time for joy, and no family who has lost a son or daughter, whether in the line of duty or in a tragic event, should have their pain turned into someone else's profit.' In response to the letter, Walmart issued a statement on Tuesday saying that it would pull all its merchandise which made reference to 'bulletproof' and 'Black Lives Matter' on the same shirt.

Share this article Share The line, which was provided by third party supplier Old Glory, included hoodies, tank tops and t-shirts, which range from $16.95 to $36.95 for the sweatshirt. Each item is black with red lettering across it which states: 'Black Lives Matter. Bulletproof.' The line has since been removed from the Walmart website.  The line, which was provided by third party supplier Old Glory, included hoodies, tank tops and t-shirts, which range from $16.95 to $36.95 for the sweatshirt Walmart issued a statement on Tuesday saying that it would pull all its merchandise which made reference to 'bulletproof' and 'Black Lives Matter' on the same shirt Walmart will continue to sell clothes with slogans such as Blue Lives Matter, Black Lives Matter and All Lives Matter.  Chris Kappelman, the head buyer for supplier Old Glory, told the Washington Post that Walmart had not informed him before removing the clothing line. But out of respect for their customers, they had removed the 'Bulletproof' shirts from other third-party sites as well. 'We understand where the FOP stand and their point of view,' Morelli said. 'We didn't want to ruffle any feathers. Also, too, we support the police in different ways.' The Black Lives Matter movement, which began after the death of Trayvon Martin in 2012, and has gathered pace with a slew of other police shootings of black men in subsequent years. The Fraternal Order of Police wrote to Walmart CEO Doug McMillon complaining that the megastore should not aim to profit off racial tensions in the US The movement, which has sparked protests across the country, states on its website that is an 'ideological and political intervention in a world where Black lives are systematically and intentionally targeted for demise.' However, some in law enforcement see the protest movement as anti-police and a pro-cop Blue Lives Matter movement has begun in response.  FOP Executive Director Jim Pasco said that while his organization doesn't oppose the 'Black Lives Matter' movement, or that slogan being printed on t-shirts, he was against the inflammatory use of 'bulletproof' alongside it - a direct reference to the police shootings. The FOP also wrote to Amazon Chairman and CEO Jeff Bezos to ask him to pull a similar clothing line although Amazon have not yet responded.  Share or comment on this article e-mail 40 shares Most watched News videos Dan Bilzerian show off glitzy lifestyle as 'King of Instagram' Blind man attaches GoPro to guide dog to record his commute Cyclist forced off the road by dangerous braking driver Heartbreaking moment horse cries at owner's funeral 'I thought he was going to hit me': Ann Widdecombe on Philpott Great White shark breaches the water in pursuit of a tasty treat "UFO" has been filmed demonstrating highly unusual behaviour Stepdaughter surprises stepmom with adoption papers at Christmas Meryl Streep arrives at Debbie Reynolds' and Carrie Fisher's memorial Dangling kid rescued from a ski lift at Whistler Mountain Police Video Shows Rescue Of Kidnapped Man Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds are buried together Pictured: The Fort Lauderdale 'air rage' gunman who 'argued...

The startling dash-cam video showed 45-year-old Jonathan Joseph Czech swerving all over the highway last July as police tried to pull the drunken semi-truck driver over. Minnesota State Patrol troopers say they were alerted to a semi-truck that was swerving over the lanes of Highway 10. The semi swerved off the road and onto the right shoulder at one point, when the driver hit a sign and swerved back onto the highway before eventually coming to a stop on the right shoulder, Fox 9 reports. Once the officer was able to pull the drunk semi-truck driver over, the overly inebriated driver tried to step out of the truck and fell into the highway. Czech was unable to stand even with assistance. The drunk driver rolled and crawled on the ground, forcing the trooper to redirect traffic around him as he was too intoxicated to get up and move out of the way of oncoming vehicles. The state patrol was forced to shut down one lane of the highway while they worked to get the drunk driver back on his feet and off the road to safety. Czech, who lives in Isle, Minnesota, told the trooper that he was traveling from Minot, North Dakota. The trooper reported that Czech’s speech was slurred, his eyes were bloodshot and watery, and he smelled of alcohol. The drunk semi driver told the trooper that he had consumed a “few beers.” EXCLUSIVE:Jonathan Czech had a great fall. Blew a .28 breath test once he rolled out of@Walmart semi he drove. More on his illegal load @ 9. pic.twitter.com/g7nmW07o8u — Iris Pérez (@IrisPerezFOX9) December 21, 2016 An inventory of the Walmart truck revealed two bottles of vodka next to the driver’s seat, one of which had been partially consumed. Czech’s blood alcohol level measured 0.28 on a breathalyzer test two hours later, more than three times the legal limit of 0.08 percent. The drunk semi driver was charged with two counts of driving while intoxicated and was convicted of third-degree DWI this week. This is the second drunk driving violation on his record. Minnesota drunk driving laws say that people convicted of a second offense face up to a year in jail and fines of up to $3,000. Drivers convicted of drunk driving also have their licenses revoked for 180 days. While Czech was driving a Walmart semi-truck, he is not employed by Walmart. The driver was working for third-party transportation company Crete Carrier Corporation. The company reports that Czech was fired after the drunk driving arrest. Over-the-road truck drivers for Walmart travel approximately 700 million miles each year, delivering merchandise to Walmart and Sam’s Clubs, Walmart says. The company maintains that their drivers manage “one of the largest and safest private fleets in the world.” A first-year Walmart truck driver earns an average of $82,000, they say, and drives an average 300-mile length of hauls with a regular work schedule. The company further says they will not hire drivers who have had convictions for a DUI, DWI, OUI, or reckless driving involving alcohol or drugs within the last 10 years, though it is unknown if that applies to contract drivers as well. Walmart also reports that Sam Walton said 25 years ago that “Walmart drivers are the safest drivers on the road. It’s a culture that helps us deliver Every Day Low Prices to customers.” Walmart says this is still true today.

The Lehigh Township Planning Commission met Dec. 12 to discuss the Walmart planned for Route 145. It abuts the Hills of Greenock and most of the people attending were from that development. Engineer John Hornick said sidewalks have been added along Birch Road. There has been talk with township engineer Phil Malitsch about uncontained runoff and energy dissipaters to cut down on flows. More detention ponds and bigger on-site facilities are planned. The building has been given a different shape, and new sound studies are being done. “Walmart has a rigorous audit before application to the Conservation District,” Hornick said. Planning Chairman David Shulman said the public will have questions they want answered. He said he believed left and right turn lanes should be included. If in the future the remaining land is developed, traffic will need to be able to go onto Birch Drive. Malitsch said by township ordinance, if traffic reaches a certain volume it has to be designed to Pennsylvania Department of Transportation standards. John Wichner, traffic planner, said they actually counted cars and made projections into the future. There were three counts made: rush hour at 7-9 a.m. and 4-6 p.m. and Saturday at midday. There were counts taken at nine intersections with the major one at Birch and Route 145. By PennDOT estimates there would be 700 vehicles in a 24-hour period. The intersection at Washington Street would be realigned. There will be a gas station with five pumps for 10 fueling stations. That will create cross traffic, which will be treated like a convenience store. Vegetation will be removed to increase sight distance. Planner Cindy Miller said she would rather have bus stops in the development instead of along a road, but Malitsch said it would be a liability issue to have them stop on development property. Shulman asked about the largest truck that would come in. It would be a WE57 semi. No doubles would come in. The truck lanes will be 25 feet wide with parking along the sides. Shulman wants to see more detail of the area. There will be a pickup area in the back where trucks are parked. Malitsch said that would be a drive-thru, not a parking space. None of the land will be mortgaged as of Dec. 31. A concern was that an unpaid mortgage would mean the store would not happen or continue. Resident Martin Baksembaum asked about the increase in runoff or how it will affect the rural aspects of the community. On the second issue Shulman said it is a permitted use at that location. To maintain the rural aspect it would have to be in the new comprehensive plan and Baksembaum said what he is seeing is similar to the present plan. The plan could be changed in the future by changing zoning, Shulman said. He asked about the possibility of failure because the supermarket in Walnutport did. That would be a business decision, not a planner’s concern. Wiehner said there would possibly be 280 extra cars and a dozen trucks per day. Resident Al Bodzin asked when they hoped to break ground. Delaney said it all depends on clearing the permitting. Shulman said it would probably be 2019 until they are finished with the number of variables. Resident Jim Albert asked how many bays there would be for tractor-trailers and what about non-Walmart trucks such as Coca-Cola and trucks used for overstock. Hornick said that information depends on the sound studies. Resident Mike Gabovitz asked about the sound wall between Walmart and the Hills of Greenock. Shulman said it was on an earlier plan. Hornick said there is sewage capacity at the Walnutport Authority. Resident Lorraine Wessner asked about lighting at the intersections. Shulman said it should be considered at both intersections. In other business: Weiner’s Auto Services, 4811 Lehigh Drive, may affect stormwater, Malitsch said, and the land use is a concern. The 120-foot building will have four bays with 60 percent used for storage. Weiner wants to keep the rural aspect. He expects 15 cars a day and said he does mostly motor work. He said he was just giving a little history and did not expect an answer that day. The person he brought the property from was present and said though it was used for warehousing it had been previously used for auto repair and was permitted.

Sheriff’s Office Shop With a Cop 0 By CBN on December 22, 2016 E-Headlines Shop with a Cop is a joint venture between local law enforcement agencies throughout Deschutes County, local Walmart stores and McDonalds. Its primary focus is to help make the holidays a little brighter for less-fortunate families, and provide an opportunity for children to engage in positive police interaction. Shop with a Cop completed its 16th year collecting items and assisting children and families throughout the year with basic needs during emergencies. “I am proud to say this program has stayed true to the ideals since founded in 2000: To provide less fortunate students with a one-on-one experience with uniformed law enforcement while shopping for holiday presents for themselves and family members. In addition, this program assists children and families throughout the year with basic needs during emergencies,” stated Sheriff L. Shane Nelson. This program helps to establish positive law enforcement interaction with the children and their families. “Each year the children surprise us. We see many shoppers pass by the toy aisle and go directly to the clothing section of Walmart. They say they need warm clothes and shoes for themselves and their siblings. However, nothing can prepare a deputy for the realization of what he or she may encounter when escorting their student shopper home. Last year, one deputy was puzzled by his student’s shopping list containing mostly disposable items and blankets. When the deputy took the boy “home” he came to realize the depth of this child’s need. The boy and his family lived in the Bend Walmart parking lot in their car. With temperatures below freezing, this 10 year old boy said he and his family struggle to stay warm at night.” This year the team shopped with over 123 students. Their shopping lists included 558 family members. The compassion and generosity of our citizen’s really do make a difference in the lives of children in Deschutes County. 100 Percent of the donations are applied to the local program. This year the students shopped on December 13th at the Redmond Walmart store and on December 14 and 15 at the Bend Walmart store. “We thank all the citizens who donated to this cherished annual event and the members of the Deschutes County Sheriff’s Office, Bend Police Department, Redmond Police Department, Sunriver Police Department, Black Butte Police Department, U.S. Forest Service-Law Enforcement Division, Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office, Oregon State Police, Prineville Police Department, Bureau of Land Management-Law Enforcement Divison and Crook County Sheriff’s Office who took the children shopping and delivered them and their presents to their home.” SheriffPIO@deschutes.org Share.

With the holiday shopping season creeping earlier in the calendar and Black Friday deals starting to show up weeks before Thanksgiving, retailers are offering deeper cuts in their after-Christmas sales in the hope of breaking through the retail fatigue. The week after Christmas offers the last chance to draw in customers before they settle into winter hibernation, so stores will go the extra mile to make it worth their while. The retail website TheBlackFriday.com has compiled a list of all the after Christmas sales, showing that deals on flat-screen televisions and video game bundles remain just as popular after the holiday as they were before. Some of the top after Christmas deals include the following items. Walmart: Vizio 55-inch HDTV for $378 Target: Xbox One (with controller and digital download of Minecraft) for $249.99 Best Buy: LG 55-inch HDTV for $399.99 But major retailers aren’t the only ones trying to draw in shoppers for their after Christmas 2016 sales. Many smaller chains and local outlets are also slashing prices to clear the shelves of excess holiday gifts and seasonal items, so picking up the local newspaper on or after Christmas (or checking directly on their websites) can reveal even more savings. After Christmas sale. Use coupon code SHOPSMALL10 at Frugal Fortune in our online Etsy shop to… https://t.co/3oDZwWCh2R #couponcode #Deals — Frugal Fortune (@frugalfortune) December 22, 2016 The after-Christmas 2016 sales are mostly aimed at enticing shoppers to spend the gift cards they got over the holiday, retail experts noted. “Years ago, before online shopping became a big deal, the week after Christmas used to be all about returns,” Jim Easley, general manager of the Staten Island Mall, told SILive.com. “Now that week has become when everyone comes to the mall and spends those gift cards that they got over the holidays.” For shoppers looking to hit up the after-Christmas 2016 sales, experts offer a bit of advice on what to buy and what to avoid. Melissa Martin of BlackFriday.com told SILive.com that clothing will be available at a great discount, as retailers are eager to empty their stock before the clothes are out of style. Toys that didn’t sell as well during the holiday season will also have prices clashed, and holiday decorations can be found at anywhere up to a 90 percent discount — depending on how long shoppers are able to wait to buy it. And DealNews.com noted that shoppers looking for cameras can find some great deals in the after Christmas 2016 sales. “One category of electronics stands out as a hot post-holiday buy: cameras. During after-Christmas sales last year, 37% of camera deals were Editors’ Choice. Canon offered some of the hottest deals we’ve seen on both refurbs and new models in late January. We saw refurb lenses starting as low as $49.99 and up to $700 off new cameras.” But other purchases may not be so wise during the after Christmas sales. The National Retail Federation noted that television prices will actually be lower in the week before the Super Bowl and that luxury brands often end their deals before Christmas arrives. 10 Things That Go On Sale After Christmas https://t.co/teQKtee2qz on @bloglovin — TOTS Family (@totsfamily) December 20, 2016 “The great buys are on the after-Christmas wear, the coats, the hats and boots will be marked down considerably,” Melissa Martin told SILive.com last year. “But stay away from those luxury coat brands, like North Face, because those [prices] usually don’t go down regardless.” But those looking to hit up the after Christmas sales should keep time on their side. Many of the deals will last only as long as the stores have sale items in stock, so the earlier they can get out to do their shopping, the better.

(Photo: Saul Loeb, AFP/Getty Images) From the depths of grandma's closet to the shelves of major retailers, the deliberately “ugly Christmas sweater” is turning into big business. Whether it's a sweater depicting a knit Darth Vader wearing a neck scarf or a cheery "Chillin' with my Snowmies" pullover, the more outrageous, the better. Major chains like Target, Sears and Walmart report they have been offering wider assortments every year. “Since Halloween, customer interest in ugly Christmas sweaters has exploded,"  Walmart spokeswoman Meggan Kring, adding that searches on Walmart's site peaked in the second week in November. Now, she says many items are sold out, though they’re replacing inventory with other ugly sweater options. Sears says it's sold out of some of its worst -- or best, depending on how you look at it -- holiday sweaters. Target offered a two-person sweater this year, and one of their top selling items was an ugly sweater dress that looks a little like “Mrs. Claus’ gingerbread dress,” according to spokeswoman Jessica Carlson. “Hanukkah themed sweaters have also been popular over the past couple years. So it’s not just Christmas -- it's across all of the holiday celebrations,” she said. Sears spokesman Mitchell Lee said consumers want the most garish sweater items available for their “Ugly Christmas Sweater” parties or picture days at work. "Success comes from how fun the sweaters can be and whose is the most outrageous…or, I suppose, “ugliest.'" Lee says. Shortages of of the worst is leaving some holiday celebrants scrambling. On Twitter, many shared stories of their fruitless searches for the perfect ugly Christmas sweaters. “I looked all over for an ugly Christmas sweater today, and every place was sold out,” tweeted @RickyyLopezz this week. USA TODAY Don't forget to pick up your ugly Chrismukkah sweater as tchotchkes abound I looked all over for an ugly Christmas sweater today and every place was sold out 😔— RICKY (@RickyyLopezz_) December 21, 2016 Couldn't find a nice ugly Christmas sweater 😭they all sold out— Roberto Reyes (@RReyes46) December 17, 2016 For decades, ugly Christmas sweaters were considered white elephants foisted on the unsuspecting by grandmothers or others with the best of intentions. They started taking on a life of their own a few years ago when some revelers started deliberately seeking out the over-the-top items from thrift stores or garage sales. At the time, no one would have suspected they would become such hot-ticket apparel at major retailers. USA TODAY Don't forget to pick up your ugly Chrismukkah sweater as tchotchkes abound Target has carried “ugly or festive holiday sweaters” in its inventory since 2013, according Target's Carlson. “It has certainly been a product that people have wanted and increasingly each year come back to Target to buy.” Carlson said Target had seen double-digit growth in its festive and ugly Christmas sweater merchandise compared to last year. It’s becoming increasingly clear that the ugly Christmas sweater is having its “pet rock” moment, Mark Cohen, a Columbia Business School professor, referring to a 1970s fad that has become a symbol of the ultimate useless gift. “It’s the perfect gift for someone you feel you must buy something for, but who has everything," he said. USA TODAY Hanukkah overlaps with Christmas this year. But why all the moving around? As for the sweater craze, it’s not just traditional retailers that are cashing in. Fred Hajjar, president of UglyChristmasSweater.com, said his team went from $40,000 in ugly Christmas sweater sales in 2012, to almost $5 million last year. Hajjar said he and his brother noticed the ugly Christmas sweater trend in 2011 when they saw horrendous holiday sweaters going for hundreds on eBay. “We purchased the domain name UglyChristmasSweater.com, and in 2012 launched the site and sold tons of sweaters,” he said. “That year it was more grandma-type sweaters, but it’s now transitioned to a mixture of grandma, trendy and crazy.” Hajjar said this year has been a transition year for the company as his crew has made changes to compete with big-box stores. “We had some sweaters that were more risqué, where we knew the big box retailers couldn’t carry them,” he said, describing a sweater with a stripper on a pole and elves throwing cash at the dancer. Will the ugly Christmas sweater trend persist? Cohen said the 2016 holiday season will go down in history as a crazy year when people will pay a fortune for something supremely ugly. "In 1,000 years, if the planet is still viable, ... no doubt an archaeologist doing a Ph.D thesis will try to delve into the meaning of this ugly sweater phenomenon that came from nowhere in 2016," he said.

Time A group of people wear Black Lives Matter t-shirts. (Photo: Jack Gruber, USA TODAY) Walmart stopped selling shirts featuring the word "bulletproof" on Black Lives Matter merchandise after the world's largest police organization called the slogan offensive. Walmart said Tuesday it removed the specific item after the Fraternal Order of Police (FOP) asked them to in a letter. "Like other online retailers, we have a marketplace with millions of items offered by third parties that includes Blue Lives Matter, Black Lives Matter and All Lives Matter merchandise," said a Walmart representative. "After hearing concerns from customers, we removed the specific item with the 'bulletproof' reference." Walmart pulls 'Bulletproof,' 'Black Lives Matter' shirt after FOP request https://t.co/JQbRCs6T8npic.twitter.com/rSv1gRFMIr— PoliceOne.com (@PoliceOne) December 21, 2016 FOP National President Chuck Canterbury, in a letter sent Tuesday to Walmart President and CEO C. Douglas McMillon, called the shirts offensive and said he was concerned Walmart's decision to sell them would "damage your company's good name amongst FOP members and active and retired law enforcement officers." Canterbury also chided third-party sellers for what he called an attempt to profit off racial division. "Commercializing our differences will not help our local police and communities to build greater trust and respect for one another," the letter said. "Turning a buck on strained relationships will not contribute to the healing process." The "bulletproof" shirt did not appear on Walmart's website Thursday morning, but dozens of other "Black Lives Matter" shirts were listed. The Black Lives Matter organization, which describes itself as trying to rebuild the black liberation movement, has risen to prominence for activism in light of police shootings involving African Americans. Glenn Morelli, the owner of Old Glory Merchandise, the shirt's maker, said he's not surprised by the FOP's request. He got a call from the organization last week and decided he'd pull the shirt himself. He said the shirt now isn't featured on any of the websites selling Old Glory merchandise. "We understand where the FOP stand and their point of view," Morelli said. "We didn't want to ruffle any feathers. Also, too, we support the police in different ways." FOP Executive Director Jim Pasco said his organization doesn't oppose the "Black Lives Matter" phrase, but does object to those who intend to divide Americans racially. The organization, he said, decided to take action after the shirt was flagged by members. The FOP also posted a similar letter addressed to Amazon Chairman and CEO Jeff Bezos. The letter, dated Wednesday, raised concerns over the slogans "bulletproof," "Black Lives Matter" and "Hands Up, Don't Shoot." It urges Amazon to stop selling the items. "Because I believe you share the FOP's goal of increasing the bonds of trust between the men and women of law enforcement, I wanted to let you know that my members are very upset that you and Amazon are complicit in the sale of this offensive merchandise," Canterbury wrote. A version of the "bulletproof" t-shirts are still available on Amazon, who did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Photo / Supplied Five malnourished children have been found living in car at Walmart with healthy parents, police say. A deputy said he was on a routine patrol in Greenacres, Florida, last weekend when he spotted a blue Toyota in a Walmart parking lot. It wasn't the look of the vehicle that caught his attention but the smell emanating from it - an odour "similar to that of homeless camps", he said. Inside was a family of seven. The parents seemed healthy, police said, but the five children, aged from 4 to 14, were filthy, fatigued and so malnourished that their bones were protruding from under their skin, according to WPTV. The oldest reportedly weighed a mere 23kg, just 2kg more than his 8-year-old sibling. The parents, Donell Barron and Rikki Hart, 34, were arrested on charges of child neglect, according to WPTV. As of Wednesday evening, they were being held in the Palm Beach County Jail in lieu of $1000 bail, the Palm Beach Post reported. The Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office told local media that the children, all of whom were described as "underweight," were taken to a hospital, where at least one was treated for unusually high blood pressure. The five kids are now in custody of the Florida Department of Children and Families, the Palm Beach Post reported. Police said they took some of the children to eat at McDonald's, where they "ravenously ate the meals, as if they had not been fed in quite some time". When interviewed by the sheriff's office, Barron gave a grim account of how the family wound up living out of their car. According to the Palm Beach Post, Barron told police that they had been evicted from their home in Port St Lucie about a year ago and had spent about 10 months hopping from one hotel to another before they ran out of money. They had lived in the car for the past two months, he told police, during which time they bathed in park bathrooms and urinated in a bucket they carried in the vehicle. Deputies reported that the children ate about once a day, their meals consisting mostly of salad and bread, and hadn't seen a doctor in years, according to the Palm Beach Post. None of the children was enrolled in school, and instead were home-schooled inside the car, Barron told police. At times, Barron gave contradictory statements to deputies. First, he told them that he attended "three years of law school and practices law, but not as a lawyer", according to a police report reviewed by WPTV. Later, he said he lost his money trading stocks and had never attended law school. He described himself as a Native American with a "corporate name" and said he was "not the property of the US or any corporation," the Palm Beach Post reported. Continued below. Related Content Cartoon: Boxing Day shopping craze Editorial: Life's still a beach 'It's just not worth the heartache': Grieving daughter's plea to drivers still using their cell phones while behind the wheel Police told local media that Barron and Hart appeared to be clean and in good health at the time of their arrest. Richard Hart and Robin Johnson, identified by WPTV as Hart's parents and the grandparents of the five children, told the station they had fallen out of touch with their daughter and didn't know how the family ended up in such a state. They said she was once a homecoming queen and attended college on an academic scholarship. "Here I am sleeping in a comfortable bed and my babies had to be sleeping in a car all crammed up like that," Richard Hart said. "She was a very loving parent. She was a very doting parent. She took care of her children. How we get to this point, that's a question we can't answer." The Palm Beach Post reported that the couple ran a blog called "Holistically Beautiful" that they launched in 2014. The blog's "about" page says Donell and Rikki Barron created the site "to show the benefits of living a healthier lifestyle and discuss topics which can enrich one's life." "They believe in the importance of living a balanced life and the importance of constantly improving oneself," it says. A call to the number listed on the site went to a disconnected line and an email to the blog wasn't immediately returned. - Washington Post Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Loading Discover more Loading Loading Herald Services Book your ad Driven Photos for sale True Commercial Death Notices Public Notices Our Regional News Stories The Northern Advocate Charges over Kerikeri ute crash The driver of a ute that crashed into three lamp posts and rolled in Northland yesterday… Hawke's Bay Today Tourists' envy at best job around Gannet Beach Adventures managing director Kim Lindsay says the company is seeing a hike… Bay of Plenty Times Book shop closure end of an era The boom in charity fundraising book sales has killed off the last book exchange on the… Our Features' Top Stories Driven Steady start for new Mustang drift car New Mustang prepped for opening D1NZ drift hit out at Manfeild...

The statement says the company has a marketplace with millions of items offered by third parties, including Blue Lives Matter, Black Lives Matter and All Lives Matter merchandise.

When Arnold was first diagnosed with diabetes she needed to test her blood sugar 10 times a day. She went to Wal-Mart and found that one box, which contained only a five-day supply of test strips, was $80. Arnold called her parents and told them she didn't know what to do. She didn't have the money. Arnold then did what a lot of people do when they need help: She searched on Google. She typed in the words "cheap test strips," and Craigslist came up. She bought eight boxes for less than $100. At Wal-Mart, she would have paid $640. Arnold said, "it was like having a life sentence and then realizing that there's a cure." With this Google search, Arnold stumbled into an underground economy for diabetic supplies. It's a market that offers a lower-cost option for test strips, though it is hard for customers to know where the boxes come from. Some boxes may be repackaged and unsafe to use, and some boxes are sold by diabetics who are desperate for cash. But many of them come from people who have health insurance and have accumulated extra test strips. Article continues after sponsorship Trey falls into this category. (He asked us not to use his last name, because he fears retribution from his insurance company, even though he feels he hasn't broken any laws.) He moved from one type of blood sugar monitoring system to another type of monitoring system and ended up with 20 extra test strip boxes. At that point, Trey began researching. He said, "Obviously No. 1: Is it legal to be able to sell test strips?" Trey realized that it is legal, with a caveat. "It's kind of a gray market as long as you don't get them from Medicare and Medicaid," he said. Trey then found a local buyer on Craigslist. It starts to look a little seedy here. He put the 20 boxes in a brown paper lunch bag. "When I went to sell the test strips we met in a McDonald's parking lot," Trey said. "I came out with the bag full of test strips, and he had his wallet full of money and it was like we were doing a geriatric drug deal in the McDonald's parking lot to get rid of some test trips." Trey made $300 off the geriatric drug deal. He jokingly calls the cash he made "blood money." He used his "blood money" to buy Christmas presents for his kids. As far as we can tell, his test strips went on to the next stop: a gray market middleman, something like a wholesaler, someone like Christa Kral. Along with her cousin, Kral purchases diabetic test strips from people like Trey. Their website is called sellusdiabeticteststrips.com. To advertise, Kral used to post fliers near the train station in her town. Now her ads are online. She thinks the company's unusual tagline has also brought in customers: "Two moms will buy your test strips." Kral operates her business out of her dining room. She has a cardboard box with about 20 boxes of test strips inside. She might pay $50 a box. It depends on the brand, the condition of the box, and the expiration date for the test strips. Then she sells them at a markup to the next part of this chain: retailers. Arnold, the woman who bought test strips off Craigslist because they were too expensive at Wal-Mart, is now a retailer. That time when she couldn't afford her test strips and keep her blood sugar in check — it scared her, and it made her decide to change her career path. Arnold had been planning to go to medical school. But "that's what really made me think I shouldn't be a doctor and that I should go and help people try to afford the test strips," she said. Arnold started a website, glucomart.com. It's a place where people can buy affordable test strips. She turned her garage into a kind of pharmacy. Her floor is epoxied, and she has pharmacy shelves. Arnold realizes that if manufacturers or insurance companies lowered the price of test strips, she could be put out of business. She's actually OK with that, because, she said, "the business exists to help people afford the test strips they need." Arnold would be happy to go back to her original plan and trade in her pharmacy shelves for a doctor's coat.

And, even if you aren’t of color you may have heard of high-profile women like Oprah Winfrey exposed to racial discrimination while shopping. The phrase "shopping while black” is alive and according to the members of the campaign, Making Change at Walmart (which is funded by the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union), Walmart is its most recent discriminator. Two weeks ago, members of the Making Change at Walmart campaign claimed three Walmart stores in Virginia added extra security packaging on black hair care products. Now, this week, that same group launched a television ad asking viewers to call the mayor of Suffolk, Virginia, Linda Johnson, and "tell her to demand Walmart stop." More on stories on Walmart: The Smart Way to Shop for Beauty Products at Walmart These New Makeup Brushes At Walmart Are Under $10 and Amazing This Drugstore Curling Iron Is the Secret to the Sexiest Waves Ever Though the group claims this is happening at three Walmart locations in Virginia, The Virginian-Pilot visited the three locations they cited, but found only one store had some black hair products enclosed in plastic security containers. “We are disappointed with these allegations because they are false and offensive. Like every retailer, we take steps to make sure the items that might be high on a shoplifter’s list are protected against theft,” E. Blake Jackson, director of corporate communications told Allure. “Unfortunately, the hair care items in question are heavily targeted by shoplifters in this particular store, so we are taking normal measures to protect the items against theft so they are available for the customers who need them.” Jackson couldn’t comment if the store plans to offer extra security packaging on mainstream hair products not targeted to black women or if there are plans to remove the packaging in an effort to make amends with any shoppers they may have offended. We also reached out to the Virginia stores for additional detail, but no one was available for comment at the time of going to press. This racial issue comes on the heels of Walmart agreeing to stop selling t-shirts and hooded sweatshirts online (via a third-party merchant) that read "Bulletproof. Black Lives Matter." But as for this controversy with the Virginia stores, “these measures are not a reflection of our valued customers and any attempt to insinuate otherwise by this particular group is shameful,” says Jackson.

Wal-Mart told Fox News Insider that it will no longer sell the shirts with the words "Bulletproof: Black Lives Matter" on its website. The move came after the Fraternal Order of Police called the shirts offensive and asked the retailer to stop sales. Wal-Mart responded by providing a statement Tuesday to the Associated Press pledging to cease sales of the shirts. The statement said the company has a marketplace with millions of items offered by third parties, including Blue Lives Matter, Black Lives Matter and All Lives Matter merchandise. It said Wal-Mart removed the Black Lives Matter shirt after hearing concerns from customers. The shirts were sold by Connecticut-based Old Glory Merchandise. A company representative was not immediately available for comment. TRADE U.S. threatens action in beef with Europe The Obama administration has moved closer to taking trade actions against the European Union over its ban on most American beef products. The office of the U.S. Trade Representative said Thursday that it would schedule a hearing and seek public comment that could result in tariffs imposed on food products imported from the E.U. to the United States. In the past, products subjected to that retaliatory tariff have included Italian mineral water, Roquefort cheese and truffles. American beef exports represent a $6 billion a year business, and the move could be significant for the country's largest beef-producing states, which include Kansas, Texas and California. The E.U. has banned meat produced with growth-inducing hormones since 1989. U.S. officials have long maintained there is no scientific basis for banning hormone-treated beef, and many other countries use hormones to stimulate growth in beef cattle. In 1997, the World Trade Organization ruled that the ban violated international trade rules. AVIATION Attendants say uniforms make them ill American Airlines flight attendants filed a grievance with the carrier over new uniforms, saying they have caused headaches, skin irritation and other problems since being introduced several months ago. The airline should either stop issuing the uniforms or allow workers to wear their previous outfits, Bob Ross, president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, said in a letter to American's general counsel. The union also requested that the airline, the biggest U.S.-based carrier by traffic, reimburse flight attendants for any uniform-related health care costs and set aside $2 million to fund a study of the outfits. American Airlines Group Inc. has tested the uniforms three times and will conduct a fourth test jointly with the union, spokesman Ron DeFeo said. TRANSPORTATION Airbus secures $18 billion Iran Air deal Airbus and Iran Air finalized Thursday a deal for 100 planes worth more than $18 billion dollars at list prices — a contract that is potentially a big boost for Iran's post-sanctions economy. Under the terms of the deal, which was initially announced in January, Airbus said deliveries are expected to begin early next year. The contract includes single-aisle A320 and A330 jets and widebody A350 XWB planes. As well as further modernizing Iran's aging aviation fleet, which has been hobbled by years of sanctions, the deal is a boon to Airbus too as Iran's flag carrier had finalized a deal for 80 jetliners from U.S. plane maker Boeing Co. — Airbus' key rival — earlier this month. HOUSING Long-term mortgages climb again Long-term U.S. mortgage rates climbed again this week, hitting the highest levels since 2014. Mortgage giant Freddie Mac said Thursday that the rate on 30-year fixed-rate loans jumped to an average 4.30 percent from 4.16 percent last week and the highest since April 2014. The average for a 15-year mortgage rose to 3.52 percent from 3.37 percent last week and is the highest since January 2014. Rates on adjustable five-year mortgages shot up this week to 3.32 percent from 3.19 percent last week and highest since mid-2011. Rates have surged since the Nov. 8 election of Donald Trump. Investors have bid rates higher because they believe the president-elect's plans for tax cuts and higher infrastructure spending will drive up economic growth and inflation.

When Arnold was first diagnosed with diabetes she needed to test her blood sugar 10 times a day. She went to Wal-Mart and found that one box, which contained only a five-day supply of test strips, was $80. Arnold called her parents and told them she didn't know what to do. She didn't have the money. Arnold then did what a lot of people do when they need help: She searched on Google. She typed in the words "cheap test strips," and Craigslist came up. She bought eight boxes for less than $100. At Wal-Mart, she would have paid $640. Arnold said, "it was like having a life sentence and then realizing that there's a cure." With this Google search, Arnold stumbled into an underground economy for diabetic supplies. It's a market that offers a lower-cost option for test strips, though it is hard for customers to know where the boxes come from. Some boxes may be repackaged and unsafe to use, and some boxes are sold by diabetics who are desperate for cash. But many of them come from people who have health insurance and have accumulated extra test strips. Article continues after sponsorship Trey falls into this category. (He asked us not to use his last name, because he fears retribution from his insurance company, even though he feels he hasn't broken any laws.) He moved from one type of blood sugar monitoring system to another type of monitoring system and ended up with 20 extra test strip boxes. At that point, Trey began researching. He said, "Obviously No. 1: Is it legal to be able to sell test strips?" Trey realized that it is legal, with a caveat. "It's kind of a gray market as long as you don't get them from Medicare and Medicaid," he said. Trey then found a local buyer on Craigslist. It starts to look a little seedy here. He put the 20 boxes in a brown paper lunch bag. "When I went to sell the test strips we met in a McDonald's parking lot," Trey said. "I came out with the bag full of test strips, and he had his wallet full of money and it was like we were doing a geriatric drug deal in the McDonald's parking lot to get rid of some test trips." Trey made $300 off the geriatric drug deal. He jokingly calls the cash he made "blood money." He used his "blood money" to buy Christmas presents for his kids. As far as we can tell, his test strips went on to the next stop: a gray market middleman, something like a wholesaler, someone like Christa Kral. Along with her cousin, Kral purchases diabetic test strips from people like Trey. Their website is called sellusdiabeticteststrips.com. To advertise, Kral used to post fliers near the train station in her town. Now her ads are online. She thinks the company's unusual tagline has also brought in customers: "Two moms will buy your test strips." Kral operates her business out of her dining room. She has a cardboard box with about 20 boxes of test strips inside. She might pay $50 a box. It depends on the brand, the condition of the box, and the expiration date for the test strips. Then she sells them at a markup to the next part of this chain: retailers. Arnold, the woman who bought test strips off Craigslist because they were too expensive at Wal-Mart, is now a retailer. That time when she couldn't afford her test strips and keep her blood sugar in check — it scared her, and it made her decide to change her career path. Arnold had been planning to go to medical school. But "that's what really made me think I shouldn't be a doctor and that I should go and help people try to afford the test strips," she said. Arnold started a website, glucomart.com. It's a place where people can buy affordable test strips. She turned her garage into a kind of pharmacy. Her floor is epoxied, and she has pharmacy shelves. Arnold realizes that if manufacturers or insurance companies lowered the price of test strips, she could be put out of business. She's actually OK with that, because, she said, "the business exists to help people afford the test strips they need." Arnold would be happy to go back to her original plan and trade in her pharmacy shelves for a doctor's coat.

(REUTERS/Rebecca Cook)    4443001 Video footage taken from a Florida Wal-Mart shows a shopper literally jumping the gun. The surveillance footage, released by the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office on Wednesday, shows Michael Foster, 43, tackling Clarence Daniels from behind as he was walking into a Brandon, Fla. Wal-Mart on Tuesday. Foster followed Daniels into the store after seeing him exiting his vehicle with a gun holstered under his shirt — which was perfectly legal for the 62-year-old Daniels to do since he holds a concealed weapon license. Nevertheless, Foster tackled Daniels from behind as he entered the store, and put him in a chokehold before taking him to the ground. Witnesses said that Foster yelled out that Daniels had a gun. They also said that Daniels yelled out that he had a license for it. Foster called 911 only after he tackled accosted Daniels. He was arrested and charged with battery.

REACTIONARY17 days ago Walmart Won’t Sell ‘Bulletproof: Black Lives Matter’ Shirts After Police Protest © Edgard Garrido / Reuters Walmart has agreed to quit selling shirts that say “Bulletproof: Black Lives Matter” after the president of the national Fraternal Order of Police asked for the item to be dropped. The president, Chuck Canterbury, had also asked that the stores stop selling all other shirts carrying the words “Black Lives Matter,” but Walmart refused that request. Canterbury’s letter called the shirts “offensive.” He added, “I am concerned that allowing these articles to be sold in this way will damage your company’s good name amongst FOP members and other active and retired law-enforcement officers.” He continued, “Commercializing our differences will not help our local police and communities to build greater trust and respect for one another.” In a statement, Walmart said Tuesday night that the stores offer millions of items from different parties, including those that say Blue Lives Matter, Black Lives Matter, and All Lives Matter.

Police officers from four Upper Bucks municipalities participated. - (Photo / Melinda Rizzo) Upper Bucks County businesses teamed up with local law enforcement and other donors to ensure youngsters have a Merry Christmas. The sixth annual Shop with a Cop event Thursday at Wal-Mart in Richland Township hosted nearly 60 underprivileged elementary school students. Children were recommended by police officers and Quakertown Community School District guidance counselors. Event sponsor Joseph A. McGinley, whose law firm is in Doylestown, said helping goes beyond any business decision he can make. “On a personal level, there are kids who have a lot less than others do,” he said. A record $28,000 was donated so youngsters could shop for holiday gifts, said Robert Lee, event organizer and Quakertown police officer. About 25 officers from police departments in Dublin and Quakertown boroughs and Richland and Springfield townships participated. Robert Adams, president of Roselon Industries in Quakertown, is a longtime advocate for Quakertown and a Shop with a Cop sponsor. “Anything we can do to build up the downtown area is a good thing,” Adams said. “It’s important to be invested.” Children are matched with an officer/shopping buddy, receive a Wal-Mart gift card for $150 to shop and have their gifts wrapped and tagged by volunteers. The outpouring of financial support from area businesses has been overwhelming, Lee said. The Proper Brewing Co. sponsors the event because community involvement is part of its business model. “A business needs a healthy community to be successful,” said Kris Wilson, who owns and operates The Proper with Brian Wilson, her husband. “We aim for The Proper to be recognized as a true team player in building the Quakertown community.” Lee said contact with officers from local police departments, who volunteered their time, fostered positive perceptions of law enforcement. “I also think it’s important to let kids know that our police officers are here to help,” Wilson said.

(REUTERS/Rebecca Cook)    4443001 Video footage taken from a Florida Wal-Mart shows a shopper literally jumping the gun. The surveillance footage, released by the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office on Wednesday, shows Michael Foster, 43, tackling Clarence Daniels from behind as he was walking into a Brandon, Fla. Wal-Mart on Tuesday. Foster followed Daniels into the store after seeing him exiting his vehicle with a gun holstered under his shirt — which was perfectly legal for the 62-year-old Daniels to do since he holds a concealed weapon license. Nevertheless, Foster tackled Daniels from behind as he entered the store, and put him in a chokehold before taking him to the ground. Witnesses said that Foster yelled out that Daniels had a gun. They also said that Daniels yelled out that he had a license for it. Foster called 911 only after he tackled accosted Daniels. He was arrested and charged with battery.

And the aisles were full of holiday smiles as Christmas came early courtesy of a Super Bowl champion. “For these kids out here that might not have any Christmas at all, to be able to give them something to make them happy is what I’ve always wanted to do,” Broncos cornerback Chris Harris Jr. said. The Chris Harris Jr. Foundation hosted 50 underprivileged and at-risk youth as part of “Shop with a Jock.” Harris provided each child with dinner, courtesy of Jersey Mike’s, and $100 in gifts at Wal-Mart. “You get the interaction with them, you see the need, they really need it and they look forward to this so it’s really special,” Harris said. Fellow cornerbacks Bradley Roby and Lorenzo Doss were also there to spread the holiday cheer. Harris knows how much a night like this can impact these children because he was once in their shoes. “I never had any role models growing up, I never had anybody take me out (to shop) when my mom couldn’t afford for me to get presents for Christmas,” he said. “So I just always wanted to do this to make an impact out here.” Harris was named to his third consecutive Pro Bowl on Tuesday.

Spencer Klimek and Amber Klimek, both 23 and described as recently married, confessed to the crimes, explaining that they sold the batteries for money to support their addiction to heroin and crack cocaine, Slidell police said Tuesday (Dec. 20). They were booked Dec. 14 with two counts of simple burglary. Spencer Klimek's address of record is in Huntsville, Ala., Amber Klimek's in Cookeville, Tenn. Amber Klimek is also known as Amber Carender, police said. The two are accused of breaking into a storage bin and stealing the batteries from the Wal-Mart at 39142 Natchez Drive in Slidell on Nov. 10 and 11. Detective Thomas McNulty investigated the incidents and identified the suspects, the vehicle they used and where the batteries were being sold for cash, police said. The old batteries have a component that can be recycled. McNulty, working with detective David Carrick of the St. Tammany Parish Sheriff's Office, determined the suspects committed numerous similar crimes throughout Louisiana, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Tennessee, and Mississippi, mainly targeting Wal-Mart and Sam's Club stores, police said. A Slidell police spokesman said charges might be filed against the couple elsewhere in Louisiana and other states. follow us Twitter Facebook LInkedIn Google+ Pinterest Tumblr special report The New Orleans Gun Pipeline An exploration of the complex, violent ecosystem that keeps New Orleans criminals armed.

All three warehouse clubs have different prices. Is joining worth it? Daniel B. Kline (TMFDankline) Dec 21, 2016 at 8:20AM Even with the ability to buy things online at cheap prices, Americans still love warehouse clubs. The discount retailers charge an annual fee for membership for which consumers gain access to their stores. For what it costs to join Costco (NASDAQ:COST), Wal-Mart's (NYSE:WMT) Sam's Club, and BJ's, consumers get access to a no-frills, limited-choice shopping experience where prices are kept low. Generally words like "no-frills" and "limited-choice" are not selling points for shoppers, but the warehouse clubs have made what they don't have part of the experience. By sacrificing fancy displays, grocery bags at checkout, dealing with limited in-store personnel, and often having to buy in bulk quantities, consumers get lower prices (or at least in most cases they do.) Costco, Sam's, and BJ's may, for example, have a popular cereal, perhaps Lucky Charms or Cheerios, at a lower per-box price than a nearby supermarket. To get that price, however, shoppers may need to buy in extra-large quantities. The same applies to most food items, household supplies, and pharmacy items stocked by the three chains. You will save money on a per-serving, per-container, or per-dose basis by shopping at Costco, Sam's, or BJ's, but you will pay a price to get in the door, and there are a variety of reasons you may not actually save money shopping at a warehouse club. Warehouse clubs have no-frill checkouts where bags are not provided. Image source: author. What does it cost to join Costco, Sam's Club, and BJ's? All three chains charge an annual membership fee just to get in the door. Paying up gives you and your immediate family (you and a spouse or significant other living at the same address) access to whichever of the three you join as well as the ability to shop at their websites. The overall structure is the same for Costco, Sam's, and BJ's. Members pay once a year for 12 months of access, but the costs vary slightly. Costco: The company calls its basic membership "Gold Star" and people pay an annual fee of $55 to join. The company also sells a single-user business membership at that price (with additional cards costing $55 each) and an "Executive Gold Star" membership which costs $110, but offers 2% back on qualified purchases at the company's stores. Sam's Club: The basic Sam's Savings or Sam's Business cards cost $45 a year with the business getting cards for two people at that price (with additional cards costing $45 each). Sam's also offers the $100 a year "Sam's Plus" card which comes with cash back rewards, and other special offers much like Costco's Executive Gold Star offer. BJ's: This chain prices its basic memberships in between its two rivals. Its "Personal Membership," which includes a second card for family, costs $50, the same as its "Business Membership." The retailer also offers a "BJ's Perks Rewards" card for $100 that offers 2% cash back and other bonuses. Is joining Costco, Sam's Club, or BJ's worth it? In short, the answer is it can be, but it usually is not because people buy things they would not have otherwise purchased or they overbuy, leading to waste. The prices are cheaper than traditional stores, according to Michael Clayman, editor/writer at Warehouse Club Focus and www.warehouseclubfocus.com (account required) who spoke to The Motley Fool in an email interview. "Every year, we publish an item basket comparison between the three clubs, a Wal-Mart Supercenter, and a grocery store in the same market," he wrote. "The results have been consistent and show the dramatic savings a consumer receives by shopping at a club compared to the other two." The problem is that lower prices can mean that consumers save money, but that's not true when people buy more than they planned or more than they need. Billie Blair, an organizational psychologist who serves as CEO of Change Strategists, Inc., laid out how that happens to The Motley Fool in an email. "Taken as a whole and over a span of years, the answer is that warehouse clubs almost never save money for the individual shopper," she wrote. That, Blair added, is due to "membership fees, wastage from overbuying (produce and such), the necessity to buy in quantity (canned goods that sit on shelves and have to be discarded) etc." Warehouse clubs offer good prices, lots of perks, and it's possible to earn back the membership fee in saved money. Doing that takes the discipline to buy only what you need and only quantities you will actually use. That's possible, but difficult for many people.

(AP) — A group says some Virginia Wal-Mart stores are discriminating by using security packaging on black hair products. The Virginian-Pilot reports (http://bit.ly/2i0plbo) members of the Making Change at Walmart campaign held a news conference earlier this month, saying security boxes were being used on hair products for African-Americans at two Suffolk and Norfolk stores. The national campaign is run by the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union. This week, the group launched a television ad, asking viewers to call Suffolk Mayor Linda Johnson and "tell her to demand Wal-Mart stop." Wal-Mart spokesman Phillip Keene said in a statement that the allegations are false and offensive. Keene said some products are more frequently targeted by shoplifters, thus the company takes "normal" measures to protect the items against theft. ___ Information from: The Virginian-Pilot, http://pilotonline.com Latest from the SFGATE homepage: Click below for the top news from around the Bay Area and beyond.

All three warehouse clubs have different prices. Is joining worth it? Daniel B. Kline (TMFDankline) Dec 21, 2016 at 8:20AM Even with the ability to buy things online at cheap prices, Americans still love warehouse clubs. The discount retailers charge an annual fee for membership for which consumers gain access to their stores. For what it costs to join Costco (NASDAQ:COST), Wal-Mart's (NYSE:WMT) Sam's Club, and BJ's, consumers get access to a no-frills, limited-choice shopping experience where prices are kept low. Generally words like "no-frills" and "limited-choice" are not selling points for shoppers, but the warehouse clubs have made what they don't have part of the experience. By sacrificing fancy displays, grocery bags at checkout, dealing with limited in-store personnel, and often having to buy in bulk quantities, consumers get lower prices (or at least in most cases they do.) Costco, Sam's, and BJ's may, for example, have a popular cereal, perhaps Lucky Charms or Cheerios, at a lower per-box price than a nearby supermarket. To get that price, however, shoppers may need to buy in extra-large quantities. The same applies to most food items, household supplies, and pharmacy items stocked by the three chains. You will save money on a per-serving, per-container, or per-dose basis by shopping at Costco, Sam's, or BJ's, but you will pay a price to get in the door, and there are a variety of reasons you may not actually save money shopping at a warehouse club. Warehouse clubs have no-frill checkouts where bags are not provided. Image source: author. What does it cost to join Costco, Sam's Club, and BJ's? All three chains charge an annual membership fee just to get in the door. Paying up gives you and your immediate family (you and a spouse or significant other living at the same address) access to whichever of the three you join as well as the ability to shop at their websites. The overall structure is the same for Costco, Sam's, and BJ's. Members pay once a year for 12 months of access, but the costs vary slightly. Costco: The company calls its basic membership "Gold Star" and people pay an annual fee of $55 to join. The company also sells a single-user business membership at that price (with additional cards costing $55 each) and an "Executive Gold Star" membership which costs $110, but offers 2% back on qualified purchases at the company's stores. Sam's Club: The basic Sam's Savings or Sam's Business cards cost $45 a year with the business getting cards for two people at that price (with additional cards costing $45 each). Sam's also offers the $100 a year "Sam's Plus" card which comes with cash back rewards, and other special offers much like Costco's Executive Gold Star offer. BJ's: This chain prices its basic memberships in between its two rivals. Its "Personal Membership," which includes a second card for family, costs $50, the same as its "Business Membership." The retailer also offers a "BJ's Perks Rewards" card for $100 that offers 2% cash back and other bonuses. Is joining Costco, Sam's Club, or BJ's worth it?

(Scott Olson/Getty Images) A 38-year-old man charged with killing a seasonal UPS driver in a Wal-Mart parking lot has been ordered to undergo a mental evaluation after telling a judge he believed he killed President-elect Donald Trump. Justin Barkley of Dryden appeared in Tompkins County Court on M (ITHACA POLICE DEPARTMENT) onday to be arraigned for the murder of 52-year-old William Schumacher, who was shot shortly before 1 a.m. on Dec. 8 outside a Wal-Mart in Ithaca. Defense lawyer James Baker says Barkley pleaded guilty to the indictment, but insisted he had shot and killed Trump, not Schumacher. Judge John Rowley declined to accept the plea and adjourned the indictment to Jan. 6, ordering an evaluation to determine if Baker is competent to stand trial. Prosecutors say Barkley didn’t know Schumacher. Officials haven’t disclosed a motive.

The surveillance footage, released by the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office on Wednesday, shows Michael Foster, 43, tackling Clarence Daniels from behind as he was walking into a Brandon, Fla. Wal-Mart on Tuesday. Foster followed Daniels into the store after seeing him exiting his vehicle with a gun holstered under his shirt — which was perfectly legal for the 62-year-old Daniels to do since he holds a concealed weapon license. Nevertheless, Foster tackled Daniels from behind as he entered the store, and put him in a chokehold before taking him to the ground. Witnesses said that Foster yelled out that Daniels had a gun. They also said that Daniels yelled out that he had a license for it. Foster called 911 only after he tackled accosted Daniels. He was arrested and charged with battery.

"Following" : "Follow"}} December 21, 2016 9:29am   Comments Share: Related GS Which Wall Street Firm Made The Best Stock Picks Of 2016? Don't Be Surprised If NVIDIA Closes Higher Today The Rex Tillerson Portfolio (Seeking Alpha) Related JPM Who Is Jay Clayton? 10 Companies Whose Insiders Purchased The Most Stock In 2016 The Rex Tillerson Portfolio (Seeking Alpha) During his campaign, President-elect Donald Trump dissed about half of the United States’ major corporations, and Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: GS) was not exempt from his rage – pretty much the opposite. Trump repeatedly promised to “drain the swamp,” making reference to eliminating Wall Street’s influence over domestic politics and policy. Once elected, he made a u-turn, appointing Goldman Sachs investment banker and managing partner Steve Bannon as the White House chief strategist and Steven Mnuchin as the Treasury secretary. Other former Goldman Sachs employees who will occupy key spots in Trump’s administration include Bob Rubin, Lawrence Summers, Hank Paulson and Anthony Scaramucci. Notwithstanding, Trump’s most notable move was the appointment of Goldman’s chief operations officer Gary Cohn as the director of the National Economic Council and an assistant to the president for economic policy. In a long editorial piece titled "The Vampire Squid Occupies Trump's White House," Rolling Stone’s Matt Taibbi delved into Cohn’s problematic appointment. “The new party line, emanating both from Washington and from Alt-Right yahoos on the Internet, is that people like Gary Cohn are no longer the swindling scum-lords Trump said they were a few months ago, but simply smart businessmen,” he wrote. A Close Look At Goldman's Not-So-Golden History In order for people not to get lost in rhetoric and remember how “evil” Goldman Sachs and its executives are, Taibbi went over the company’s recent history of controversy. Here are some of the main points: Goldman has “an extraordinary history of placing its executives in high-ranking governmental and quasi-governmental positions.” The bank has been mixed up in the trafficking of toxic mortgages, an extensive state corruption case in Malaysia, the manipulation of global commodity prices and “a heinous episode involving Greece in which the bank helped to mask the country's ballooning debt while simultaneously working with JPMorgan Chase [JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM)] to create an index for betting against Greece's economy.” Goldman Sachs was one of the main players responsible for the 2017 financial crisis. But, unlike Bear Stearns, Merrill Lynch and Lehman Brothers, the company survived the cataclysm. While the corporation argued that this was due to its smart and humble leadership, the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations concluded that it had instead saved itself by passing on its terrible mortgage investments to its clients while simultaneously shorting them. Through numerous, questionable deals, the bank “went from having a $6 billion bet on mortgages to having a $10 billion bet against them” in just a few months — this is what they call the "big short." Notice, however, that the company has repeatedly denied having bet against its own clients. Analysts have argued that Goldman Sachs should have gone out of business around the financial crisis, like other big banks. Nonetheless, “two little-discussed acts of government welfare in September of 2008 helped save the company,” Taibbi explained. (1) The government granted the company an emergency Commercial Bank Holding Company status, even though it was never a commercial bank, allowing it to get funds from the Federal Reserve. (2) The Fed prohibited short-selling financial stocks, protecting Goldman from smart investors who sensed that something was wrong.

On a scale of one to sexy, that Coleman you dig out of the garage and lug to the beach every summer falls somewhere around a two — a little more exciting than a can opener, nowhere near as enticing as a Viking Range. But for the past 10 years, a company called YETI has been making coolers hot. These things aren’t your average Igloos — both are coolers, sure, but in the same sense that a Bugatti and a Barbie jeep you can buy at Walmart are both cars. YETIs are thick, plastic, grizzly bear-resistant, bulletproof chests that cost between $300 and $1200. They look like a Brinks truck if you were to shrink it down, take the wheels off, and strap some handles to it. YETIs keep whatever’s inside cold for days and days without a change of ice. And they’ve been going like cold beers at a tailgate. In 2015, YETI made close to $470 million in sales, over five times its 2014 numbers. The company filed for an IPO last July, seeking a valuation of $5 billion. There’s a good chance this weekend that you or someone you know will tear the wrapping paper off one of YETI’s many offerings. The company has branched out from coolers and now sells tumblers, thermoses, hats, shirts, stickers, and more. The products are popular because they’re exceptionally effective, but also because the brand has become a status symbol in certain circles. Originally attended by hunters and fishermen, the Church of YETI is now filled with people who wish they were hunters and fishermen, as well as college kids and folks who just like a good outdoor party. Devotees evangelize about YETI on social media, more recruits arrive, and the pews overflow. “There’s basically this cult around this product.” “We had all these dudes out there wouldn’t pony up $300 for a cooler, but they had spent over $300 on logo-ed merch,” Rick Wittenbraker said, who started Yeti’s marketing department in 2009 and worked there until 2013. “It happened all the time. That’s when you start really understanding that there’s a fervor there in the population, and it is a badge of honor, and people aspire to it. There’s basically this cult around this product.” Like any religion worth its salt, YETI has a fringe flourishing around its edges. The hashtag #yetibutts — as in, YETI coolers meets human bottoms — and social media accounts like @yetibuttsdaily and @yetibutts_official are populated with tens of thousands of user-submitted photos of women photographed from behind. Women wearing little to no clothing as they sit, bare-assed, on these indestructible chests. There’s often a confederate flag, a Trump sign, or a gun involved. A high-end cooler — the innocuous thing you use to keep your beer cold or your fish from rotting — has taken on a life of its own. Roy and Ryan Seiders, two brothers and avid outdoorsmen, founded YETI in 2006 because no cooler kept things cold as long as they wanted it to. Then they stumbled upon a cooler built in Thailand that they improved by teaming up with a factory in the Philippines. The deep need in the market became apparent when YETIs started flying off the shelves of the specialty hunting and fishing stores that stocked them in the States. And the coolers were selling themselves through word of mouth. The Seiders weren’t doing a damn thing to market them. “It was almost like they were making an effort not to talk about their product,” Wittenbraker said by phone from his home in Austin. “Talk about low-hanging fruit — they didn’t even have social accounts. And I knew from my friends who owned the product that all they wanted to do was talk about this.” Wittenbraker met the Seiders through friends at a fly fishing film festival in Austin, and came up with a list of things the brothers could do to boost their products’ visibility. But the company didn’t have the manpower or the knowledge to implement his ideas, and there was basically no market competition. YETI had done $3 million in sales that year, even though the whole business shared one Gmail account and employed just eight people, including the guys working in the warehouse. Roy Seider thought Facebook was a thing teenaged girls used to talk to each other. Ambassador @KenHoeve and his Flip flotilla taking some sunset swings. #BuiltForTheWild - Hopper Flip 12 A photo posted by YETI Coolers (@yeti) on Sep 16, 2016 at 11:40am PDT Wittenbraker convinced the brothers that social media was necessary, and that he was the guy to get it going. He set about putting a marketing framework into place, targeting mostly white guys in the South, pockets of Middle America, and the Northeast, all areas where people loved to hunt and fish. The brand soon became a signifier of a rugged, cool lifestyle, and people started wearing YETI hats and T-shirts because they wanted to broadcast that they were the kind of person who did the things that made one of these fancy coolers necessary. Or at least pretend that they were. “You start piling all these things together, and you realize there’s this tribe,” Wittenbraker said. “It’s kind of aspirational. You’d have blue collar dudes making 24 grand a year, and they own a $400 cooler. Because that was symbolic to them. It was iconic to them to say, ‘Yeah, I’m there, I got the best.’ “And for wealthy people in New England, this is the best in class. The guys with the houses on Nantucket or Martha’s Vineyard or Kennebunkport, do they need a cooler that’s grizzly bear-proof and holds ice for eight days? No, not at all. But it’s that standard and it’s that quality.” “For a lot of southern schools it’s like, ‘I gotta have my Chubbies, my Southern Tide polo, my Costas with blue-mirrored lenses on a Croakies strap, and the big swoop-doo bangs.’ That’s the guy.” Wittenbraker’s plan worked, and the brand took off online. YETI currently has more than 600,000 followers on Facebook and Instagram, where it posts wholesome, back-to-the-earth type photos of people fishing, hunting, and drinking coffee or bourbon by a campfire (as well as dead animals — PETA, avert your eyes). Wittenbraker was right: All people who are obsessed want to do is talk about the object of their ardor. (I had an Uber driver overhear me talk about this article on the phone while I was in his car, and as I was getting out, he stopped me to tell me what make and model he had and how much he loved it.) “No question that social media has been a massive driving force for YETI,” YETI’s current vice president of marketing Corey Maynard said. “The power of peer referral and celebration of these communities have been foundations of our brand.” In 2012, the private equity firm Cortec bought a roughly two-thirds stake in the company for around $67 million because the Seiders couldn’t keep up with demand. Wittenbraker described the company as a brand that takes people’s passions — hunting, fishing, partying — and puts them “on steroids.” At this point, devotees are basically shooting themselves up with YETI. Hell, they’re mainlining the brand. I’ve talked to dozens of people who love YETIs, from hardcore fishermen in Maine and North Carolina, to mountain bikers in Colorado, to teachers in Texas, to finance guys in Manhattan. They spoke about how well the coolers work, but they also like what the brand represents: a rugged, outdoor lifestyle. And many of these buyers are aware that they’re drinking the Kool-Aid. Matthew Wells, a senior associate at a construction management firm in Boston, likened it to Patagonia. “You don’t really need the performance that the gear provides, but you’re into the fact that you have it,” Wells said. “And you probably wish you did more of the stuff that requires it.” YETI has tapped into another market, too: College kids and people who love to tailgate. Campuses became fertile territory for converting people to YETI worship. The company quickly found traction at Big 12 and SEC schools located in states where the coolers were already selling out. Branching out into other products like tumblers and thermoses — products that now account for 62% of the company’s sales — helped reach a less hardcore demographic. “I am a sucker for the brand,” said Chris Ravn, a banker in New York City who wrote to me via a Facebook message. “Not only does it keep my fish and beer cold, but I also still like to think I'm a frat boy!” When Wittenbraker was with the company, the products sold best in the South. Buyers were overwhelmingly male by a ratio of five or six to one. Maynard wouldn’t disclose where YETI sells best these days or who’s buying, claiming that the company has “grown substantially more balanced in terms of gender and geographic diversity over our 10-year history.” Wittenbraker thinks it’s only natural, given demographics, that the coolers would find their way to tailgates. If you’re using a cooler to hunt and fish and it works well, why would you go back to an inferior version while you’re watching football? YETI wised up quickly and began making coolers with the logos of SEC and Big 12 schools on them, though Maynard denies putting much marketing weight behind this. Yeti stack #ImJuiced #yetibutts #cooler #party #poolparty #summer16 #college #university #fraternity #sorority #letsgo #beauty #hammered #beers #drunk #dive #juicednationPosted by I'm JUICED on Tuesday, September 6, 2016 “We have very sparingly marketed overtly to tailgating or college students,” Maynard said. “Choosing instead to focus our communications on aspirational outdoor activities such as hunting, fishing, surfing, ranching, rodeo, professional BBQ, and other kinds of outdoor adventuring.” Nevertheless, YETI is now firmly rooted in the culture of southern schools, and has expanded into everyday fraternity life. “There’s this uniform and validation and level of social accreditation,” Wittenbraker said. “For a lot of southern schools it’s like, ‘I gotta have my Chubbies, my Southern Tide polo, my Costas with blue-mirrored lenses on a Croakies strap, and the big swoop-doo bangs.’ That’s the guy. And every college has, like, six billion of those dudes. They’re the same guys, not all of ‘em, but a lot of ‘em, who buy the coolers.” * * * I first heard about #yetibutts this summer when I was talking to someone who mentioned that he and his buds from college thought the hashtag was funny. I asked him what #yetibutts was, and he told me to just look it up on Instagram. So I did. And found myself scrolling through thousands of pictures of women’s bare butts. Not all of the coolers in these photos have college decals on them. But many do. And most of the owners of the butts — which are overwhelmingly white — appear to be college-aged. They’re also faceless, because the pictures are taken from behind. There are levels to #yetibutts. Some photos just feature women on coolers wearing bikinis. Sometimes they’re wearing thongs. Sometimes they aren’t wearing anything. But many pictures also involve Trump stickers, or flags with the president-elect’s name on them wrapped around these half-naked women (there’s a big overlap between #yetibutts and #babesfortrump). There are also a lot of guns. A woman might be holding one, or maybe a hunting rifle leans up against the cooler as she poses with a beer in one hand and dangles a bra off the finger of another. “Not only does it keep my fish and beer cold, but I also still like to think I'm a frat boy!” And then you start to notice that many of these photos feature Confederate flags, an undeniably racist symbol. It could be the print of a bikini, a sticker on the cooler’s plastic siding, or an actual flag draped over a woman’s shoulders or held above her head. If you weren’t troubled already, maybe the Confederate flag will do it for you. Or maybe you don’t see anything wrong with any of this at all. In August, The Daily Caller, a conservative website, posted about #yetibutts, calling it The Biggest Trend Sweeping Across College Campuses. Maxim then picked the story up and gave the post this kicker: “If Yeti Butting were a major, all these girls all deserve to graduate Cum Laude.” Currently there are 97,674 posts tagged with #yeticoolers on Instagram and 11,153 posts tagged with #yetibutts (there’s a #yetiboobs hashtag, too, but it’s misleading, because the pictures mostly still just feature butts). That’s so many butts! I can’t find the first picture ever posted, but the movement seems to have taken off in 2016: The account @Yetibuttsofficial has gained 11.9k followers since the first post on June 21 of this year, and @yetibuttsdaily has amassed 26.6k since Feb. 22. YETI disavows #yetibutts. “We had nothing to do with the hashtag and do not support or condone the instances where it has been used in connection with offensive material,” Maynard said. YETI doesn’t seem to be actively trying to shut any of these accounts down. I reached out to the company to see if they’ve sent any cease and desist letters, but didn’t hear back by the time of publication. The company has, in the past, gone after people who are selling goods with the YETI trademark but are not officially affiliated with the brand. The #yetibutts accounts don’t appear to be monetized. When I asked @yetibuttgirls via an Instagram message if they made any money off the account, I got this response: “No I don’t. The guys and I have thought about selling clothes and hats and stickers but we’d have to change the name. Consider we would get in a lot of trouble with YETI for using there [sic] name.” When I asked where they lived and what their name was, the owner of the account didn’t respond. #merryxmas #merrychristmas #yetibutts #yetibuttsdaily #yeticoolers #yetibutt A photo posted by Yeti Butts (@yetibuttsdaily) on Dec 5, 2016 at 8:43pm PST Wittenbraker says he first noticed the #yetibutts trend when the brand started holding contests for user-generated content on Facebook. They’d see these kinds of photos come in on their page, and they deleted the ones they had control over. Maynard was clear that there is no official relationship between this organic guerrilla marketing movement and the company itself. YETI prefers to push the rugged outdoor lifestyle rather than one based on naked women and confederate flags. But figuring out how the latter attached itself to a cooler — a cooler! — isn’t rocket science. “I think part of that really comes down to, well, here’s this item,” Wittenbraker said. “By itself, it’s pretty benign and has this standalone purpose. But it gets pulled into these other arenas because of its impact on these activities that people go crazy about. So when you really look at it as temporary housing for beer, and that everywhere beer goes, the cooler goes ...” He paused. “... then it doesn’t take long to understand how it sort of got there.” YETI coolers have morphed from an efficient piece of sporting equipment into a container for multiple American forms of worship, from enjoying nature, to tailgating, to flying the Confederate flag. But as long as you’ve got people coming into your sanctuary and tossing bills in the collection plate, do you really care what made them walk through the door?

COMMENT Santa’s supply chain is actually a possibility, as we discover in this piece Ben Lobel Santa Claus’ supply chain is objectively impressive. According to the lore surrounding this mysterious businessman, he delivers one present to every child in the world — that’s 1.93 billion children — in one evening. It sounds like an impossible task for an impossible man. However, the real takeaway for small businesses — and the real Christmas miracle — is that Santa’s supply chain is actually a possibility. 1. It’s all just a matter of mathematics Firstly, that figure of 1.93 billion needs readdressing. It’s well established that children who don’t believe in Santa and those on the naughty list don’t make the cut. A reasonable guess, therefore, would be that Santa delivers to, say, 1.5 billion children on Christmas Eve. This means his elves need to make 1.5 billion presents every year. This is perfectly doable. Assuming that the average elf works just a little bit harder than the average German at 1,500 hours a year, and if we assume that an elf can make one present every two hours on average, then Santa would need two million employees to make his supply chain a reality. Two million employees, as it turns out, is a perfectly realistic number as well. Walmart, the biggest private employer in the world, has more than two million workers. Surely, anything Walmart can do, Santa can do better, right? 2. Secrets can be valuable Santa’s business model should be the envy of any aspiring entrepreneur. His brand is instantly recognisable, his organisation is global in a wildly ambitious way, and he has absolutely no competition. Yet, part of the reason why so much of the mathematics surrounding Santa’s supply chain is guesswork and analogy is that Santa keeps his cards close to his chest. This, in turn, would explain why Santa remains the father of Christmas… Father Christmas, if you will. Trade secrets can market your business as unique against a backdrop of samey competition by creating a secretive aura around what you do. Coca-Cola, for example, has marketed their fizzy drink on a ‘secret recipe’ for years. Santa’s supply chain does the same thing. With his enigmatic approach to his organisation, Santa remains a lovable and reputable brand after hundreds of years. 3. Let other people market for you Marketing isn’t so much a science as it is an art. There are few cases of one-size-fits-all and, even when you think you’ve found one, there’s always one business that does things differently. One definite rule that all businesses should follow is to have an active Facebook and Twitter account. After all, you can’t expect to go very far without interacting with your followers on Twitter and Facebook. Except that Apple, the largest tech company in the world and the eighth largest company in the world overall, has both a Facebook and Twitter account on which it has posted absolutely nothing. Ever. Do you know who else hasn’t ever posted anything on Facebook or Twitter? Santa Claus. Yet despite this, or maybe even because of it, Santa’s supply chain and his brand remain synonymous with Christmas and good feelings. The moral for small businesses isn’t that they need to avoid social media (remember, one size doesn’t fit all when it comes to marketing). Rather, small businesses need to recognise that letting their customers market their business for them can be a more powerful tactic than doing it yourself. Santa’s brand and the story of his supply chain tap into the emotions of his customers. As a result, people wind up posting on Twitter and Facebook about Santa every time December rolls around. All of this is free advertising for the man in red. Still, the odd verified Tweet here and there wouldn’t exactly hurt his brand either. It would certainly help to silence all those ‘Santa Claus isn’t real!’ types… 4. Be consistent and safe Of course, noone’s going to be marketing your brand every year, for free, on the basis that you’re a kind, lovable and amazing person, if you’re not a kind, lovable and amazing person. Still, small businesses need not aim for Santa levels of merriness. Instead, small businesses should remember that customers value brands they can trust — and who’s more trustworthy than Ol’ Saint Nick? Santa’s appeal is vested in the fact that people know exactly what to expect from his business. He’s a philanthropic present giver who visits once a year, dressed in red and with his nine magical reindeer in tow. Santa’s brand is consistent, it’s reliable and it lives up to its name. This is a lesson that businesses should learn. A practical and actionable way that businesses can achieve consistency is through safety. Nothing is more consistent than a safe supply chain and you can bet that Santa likely employs a few thousand extra elves to deliver regular equipment inspections and sleigh inspections. Then there’s Santa’s warehouse. Storing 1.5 billion toys is no mean feat. Each toy is going to be individual and each toy needs to be stored so that his elves know exactly which gift is going to which child. A warehouse like that would require a herculean amount of bureaucracy to keep things orderly. A huge part of that is safety. In the UK, Canada and Australia, the government recommendations on warehouse racking inspection frequency differ somewhat. However, a good general rule to take from these three countries is that warehouse racking inspections should happen at least once a year from an outside expert. All countries also recommend more regular rack safety inspections from staff. Getting elves to inspect racking on a regular basis isn’t going to be an issue (these guys are meticulous and magical), but getting an outside expert in might be problematic. Santa wants to keep his supply chain a secret, so bringing in just anybody is a definite no. Still, I hear that the Easter Bunny is free most of the year. Whether or not he’s qualified to inspect racking is another issue altogether, though. For small businesses, safety should also be a big part of what keeps your business model consistent and reliable. If racking collapses in Santa’s warehouse, there go 1,000 presents (about 15 month’s work for one elf). Besides that, there’s the danger of elves being caught in the collapse as well. Your business might not be as Christmassy, but the financial and human costs of an unsafe workplace are the same. It’s why OSHA calculates that businesses can save four to six dollars for every one dollar they invest in safety. 5. Don’t be a Scrooge The most important lesson for small businesses to learn from Santa is to be generous at Christmas time. Not only do customers expect it — in terms of deals and offers — but it’s a great way to sell more stuff at the busiest time of the year. More than that, not being a Scrooge just means being nice. Treat your employees well at Christmas and they’ll likely stay on until next Christmas. It’s not just Santa who recognises the value of being nice to his staff. Richard Branson has often spoken at length about the value of being kind to your employees. Wait a second. Richard Branson is an older man with white hair and a white beard, he runs a huge global operation, his business’ favourite colour is red, and he owns a fleet of planes capable of delivering things all over the world… Coincidence?

Lauderdale Airport Freeze Watch in effect for Jacksonville area this weekend Video: Ponte Vedra Beach woman accused of ramming car at intersection >> Read more trending stories Officials at the discount superstore announced Tuesday that its 11,462 stores across the world would close at 6 p.m. Saturday -- two hours earlier than usual. "Our associates work hard all year to make this holiday season special for our customers, and we truly appreciate what they do every day. We also know that getting home on Christmas Eve to spend time with families is important," Judith McKenna, executive vice president and CEO, said in a statement. "That's why this year, we'll be closing at 6 p.m. on Christmas Eve." Walmart was one of the major retailers that continued its extensive Thanksgiving Day and Black Friday hours, despite the trend among competitors, including Costco, Dillard's and Barnes and Noble, to close their doors on the holiday. Walmart stores are all closed on Christmas Day.

STARTUP Mercari Sees Room For Disruption In E-Commerce Japanese unicorn and marketplace platform Mercari is making a huge global play and taking market share from the likes of Amazon and eBay. By Alex Moazed Alex Moazed is the CEO of Applico, which he founded with credit cards in college. He advises companies like Google and those in Highland Capital's portfolio on platform innovation and has developed more than 300 apps. @AlexMoazed Founder and CEO, Applico@AlexMoazed WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement One would think the e-commerce battle has been settled, with Amazon firmly at the top and Walmart's recent acquisition, Jet.com, in second place. In complete spite of this, Japanese startup Mercari is setting out to carve its own niche in the field and doing quite well in its charge forward. After raising $75 million in March, the marketplace platform's valuation pushed above $1 billion, making Mercari officially a unicorn, and Japan's first one in years. It's completely dominated the e-commerce market in Japan since its founding in February 2013, connecting everyday people looking to buy and sell everyday items. Now, with its sights firmly set on becoming a serious global player, Mercari has been heavily investing in expanding its platform to the US. Leading that effort is Ryo Ishizuka, the CEO of Mercari's American business unit. Ishizuka is a seasoned entrepreneur, having founded and led RockYou, one of the first companies to start building games for social networks like Facebook and MySpace. The RockYou team expanded to Asia and became a dominant player in those markets, which caught the eye of Ishizuka's partner in Mercari, CEO Shintaro Yamada. The founding Mercari team came together in Japan in mid-2013 and knew they had a massive uphill battle ahead of them, taking on the likes of eBay, Amazon, and any other dynamic e-commerce startups that were in the mix then or would pop up later. From the outset, Mercari was meant to be a global company. Its core team all had previously founded and led successful startups of their own, but they didn't grow significantly outside of their respective domestic markets. Thus, their thirsts for success had not been slaked. Considering the opportunity for disrupting the Japanese e-commerce market and their distinct familiarities with Japan made it the perfect place to get their footing. Explosive growth fueled Mercari's takeover in Japan and, less than a year after their founding, it was already expanding to the US. "We really saw the US as a gateway to the rest of the world, to becoming a global company," said Ishizuka. Since that expansion, Mercari has seen over 20 million downloads in the US and plans to double its American team over the next year. Selling Something Different When the company started, Mercari's founders believed that e-commerce was still an open and competitive field. Their path to success, however, would require them to build and offer a unique value proposition. A distinguishing feature of Mercari's approach is that they built their business mobile-first, designing the app and launching that first, which is likely a product of their timing when compared to Amazon, Craigslist, and eBay. The most important piece to their strategy was making the whole easy and seamless. Rather than a mixed fee approach for sellers like eBay uses, the platform simply charges sellers ten percent for the transaction. When the sale is made, sellers are offered a quick shipping option via Mercari. The average transaction in Mercari's marketplace is between twenty and thirty dollars. With the platforms taking only ten percent ($2 or $3 each time), this figure reveals the sheer volume of transactions taking place on the platform considering the platform pulls $12.2 billion JPY ($107 million USD) in annual revenue. Even the onboarding process for sellers is made to be simple. By comparison, eBay sellers must hurdle seven or eight steps, but Mercari only requires five. As well, the delay for listings appearing on the platform is mere minutes, while eBay frequently has hours-long delays before the listing is public. Having An Impact Mercari's approach is also having some noteworthy and positive side effects. When targeting the initial market, Ishizuka and team realized that people were becoming less fixated on buying new brand items every time they wanted something. In fact, they found this trend occurring worldwide. A bulk of Mercari users are buying and selling used items, which Ishizuka finds to be much more economical and friendlier to the environment. "We found the market was a lot more resource-conscious and we wanted to build for that," said Ishizuka. "Our platform enables a lot of people to clean up the house and make some money while they do it." The most active demographic in the marketplace is women in their 20s and 30s, in both Japan and the US. Both user bases are significantly comprised of stay-at-home mothers and housewives and Ishizuka sees Mercari as a tool for them to gain more purchasing power and financial independence. Mercari's Future As has been stated previously, Mercari has a hard focus on becoming a global marketplace. Right now, buyers and sellers can only interact with each other within their respective countries, but Ishizuka wants to see the markets all connect and allow smooth transactions across borders. The biggest startup competitors include the likes of OfferUp and LetGo, yet Mercari isn't worried about them. "OfferUp focuses on neighborhoods, while Mercari started operating nationally. Starting at that level gives our buyers and sellers much more choice than they would on OfferUp," said Ishizuka. "This increase in choice improves the chances of transactions taking place." In Japan, the Mercari platform was relatively free of fake listings and counterfeit items, but that was not the case in the US. The team vastly underestimated the amount of management the American market would require. Their small operations division grew tremendously (alongside an algorithm) to handle not only the problem of verifying listings, but also handling the spike in returns the platform was getting. Most Japanese users tend not to request to do a return of items purchased. Instead, they typically give the undesirable item away or resell it, while Americans have a culture of getting their money back for a returned item. Thankfully, the platform self-polices via the rating system and organically weeds out bad actors, which is a big supplement to the company's direct efforts, according to Ishizuka. To remedy any fraudulent transactions that get through the safeguards, Mercari refunds the transaction to the buyer. After a couple years operating in the US, Mercari has found incredible success given the crowded market for e-commerce. The startup has already opened a new office in London and plans to launch the app early next year, taking the step in their quest to achieve a global presence.

Webster, NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune The Times-Picayune Email the author | Follow on Twitter on December 21, 2016 at 11:52 AM comments A man accused of attempting to steal a television from Walmart, then trying to get away in a stolen truck with the owner sleeping inside, was arrested Wednesday (Dec. 21). The U.S. Marshal's Gulf Coast Regional Task Force and the Kenner Police Department arrested Clyde Reed, 35, on an outstanding warrant that charged him with carjacking, simple kidnapping, negligent injuring, simple battery, reckless operation of a motor vehicle, hit and run driving, and theft of goods. Reed is accused of trying to steal a television from Walmart, 8912 Veterans Boulevard, by placing the appliance in a shopping cart then pushing the cart out the front doors without paying, police said. When store employees tried to stop him, police said Reed abandoned the television, ran into the parking lot, and got into a 2014 Ford F-150 pickup truck that was parked with the engine running. Reed wasn't aware that the owner of the truck was sleeping in the backseat. The 28-year-old owner woke up when Reed got in the truck and gunned the engine, police said. As the two men fought, Reed lost control of the truck and crashed into a 1986 GMC SUV that was being driven in the parking lot, police said. Reed then fled on foot. The driver of the SUV was taken to a local hospital and treated for lacerations to his head. follow us Twitter Facebook LInkedIn Google+ Pinterest Tumblr special report The New Orleans Gun Pipeline An exploration of the complex, violent ecosystem that keeps New Orleans criminals armed.

Share Tweet Share Email Comments Print NEW YORK — Holiday shopping procrastinators can breathe easy. Yes, most online shipping deadlines have passed. But many retailers are offering other ways to get gifts at the last minute, whether it’s staying open through the wee hours of the night like Toys R Us, or offering Christmas Eve store pickup like Wal-Mart. RELATED CONTENT: Scroll through The Blade’s Gift Guides for holiday ideas Here are some options for those still scrambling to buy presents: MIDNIGHT RUNS Many stores are extending their hours in the days leading up to Christmas. Toys R Us will stay open from 6 a.m. on Dec. 23 straight to 9 p.m. on Christmas Eve, while department store Kohl’s are staying open now until Christmas Eve. Certain Macy’s department stores will be open all night between Dec. 22 and Dec. 23. Sears will close at midnight through Dec. 23 and close at 6 p.m. on Christmas Eve. And Target will be open from 7 a.m. to midnight through Dec. 23 and stay open until at least 10 p.m. on Christmas Eve. SHOP THE UNEXPECTED If you can’t make it to the mall, a quick stop at a drug or specialty store might work. CVS, Walgreens and Rite Aid are increasingly stocking their shelves with more toys for the little ones. And those three drugstores also have a big selection of plastic gift cards for use at other stores, such as video game retailer GameStop or bookseller Barnes & Noble. Meanwhile, office supplies store Staples sells flying drones and adult coloring books. And Dick’s Sporting Goods has Apple Watches, headphones and GoPro cameras. STORE PICKUP If you want to avoid searching for items in the store, you’re in luck. Many retailers let you buy items online and pick them up at a store the same day. After ordering and paying online, walk to a special section of the store with the confirmation email and ID and that’s it. Macy’s, Target and Best Buy are just some of the stores that offer store pickup. Wal-Mart says customers who order items before 6 p.m. on Dec. 23 can pick them up on Christmas Eve and even launched a website with the items that qualify at walmart.com/lastminutegifts. And at Sears.com, those who opt for store pickup between now and Christmas Eve can get 20 percent off clothing, jewelry and home goods if they type in a special promo code. SEND AN E-GIFT The websites of some major stores are offering a way to give an instant gift, called an e-gift. It’s similar to a gift card, but is supposed to be a little more personal: You choose the item you want to buy — say sneakers or a sweater — click the “E-Gift” or “GiftNow” button, pay, and then the recipient gets an email telling them you bought them a gift. The gift receiver accepts it and can make adjustments, such as changing the color or size, before it ships. Or they can just get something else entirely from the store. The service carries no extra charges to the gift giver or receiver, and is available on several websites, including Saks Fifth Avenue, Nordstrom and Ralph Lauren. SAME-DAY DELIVERY It will cost you more, but if you’re desperate, you can get some items delivered the same day you order them online. Macy’s offers same-day delivery in some cities and so does Nordstrom. But be aware, some may not deliver on Christmas Eve, like Nordstrom. If you’re an Amazon.com Prime member paying the annual fee, the online retailer is lets shoppers in Miami, New York and other cities order toys, electronics and other gifts as late as 9:45 p.m. on Christmas Eve for delivery in two hours, meaning you’ll get it before midnight. OR JUST WAIT Procrastination may work in your favor if you end up not seeing a person you’re shopping for until after Christmas. That’s when after-holiday sales kick in, says Sara Skirboll, a shopping and trends expert at shopping deal app RetailMeNot. If the timing works, you’ll likely pay less for a gift than you would if you had bought it before the holidays, says Skirboll.

The focus for Gold Medal Services for 2017 is ‘sharpening the axe.’ “Our first 10 years in the business we worked a million hours,” Agugliaro says. “We had work, but we didn’t know what we were doing. It was seven days a week. It took a toll on us mentally, on our relationships and on everything else.” In 2004, Agugliaro had his wake-up calls. His son was about to be born and he realized, “ … this will be crazy. I’m never home. I’m going to miss all of his games and all the little things he’ll do in life. Holy crap, something’s got to give or I’ll be an absentee dad. And then Rob Zadotti walked into the shop and said, “I can’t take it no more. I’m done. I’m out of this.” Which made Agugliaro announce that he was quitting too. When Zadotti objected, they started talking. There had to be a better way and they intended to find out what it was. So did they join a trade association or look for a franchise? Nope. 1-800-Got-Junk and Zappos He looked at another company building a large service operation, 1-800-Got-Junk. He looked at Zappos. One of their suppliers believed in them so much that it paid for Agugliaro and Zadotti to spend a week at the Disney Institute. He learned from Dan S. Kennedy, author of 13 business books on sales, marketing and management, and from Joe Polish, the founder and president of Piranha Marketing Inc. and the creator of the Genius Network. They learned how other companies deliver world-class service. They learned how best-in-class companies handled operations, company culture, and marketing, and started applying the lessons one by one. In 2004, they were billing less than $1 million. By 2006, they had turned the company around and started adding on services. Were their models other successful contractors? Nope. Agugliaro looked at Target and Wal-Mart. “The idea was to be a one-stop shop that could serve you for anything you needed in your home,” Agugliaro says. “We started to see what other companies were doing like Target or Wal-Mart and we were seeing at least 10 years ago that convenience is the most important thing on the planet. Customers don’t have the time and can’t wait for multiple companies to come out to service them.” ‘The idea was to be a one-stop shop that could serve you for anything you needed in your home.’ Gold Medal Service today performs plumbing, heating and cooling, waterproofing, one-day bathroom solutions, indoor air quality, water filtration, standby generators and electrical service. Gold Medal Service has a 15,000-sq.ft. building and it recently purchased another 10,000-sq.ft. building. It will run service out of one and the installation department out of the other. Unlike some franchise operations, Agugliaro believes the different lines of business should be run under the single brand name of Gold Medal Service. The operations occupy separate line items in his budget and have their own supervision, but they are not separate departments or divisions. Agugliaro notes that the firm doesn’t need separate call centers, dispatching or trucks. They also employ what he calls “super techs” that can service multiple trades. Multiple skills sets “A lot of guys come in with one core skill set and our first task is to enhance that skill set to make them the best at what they know,” Agugliaro says. “And then, next we ask them what’s the service that intrigues them? It’s common for an air conditioning guy to want to learn electrical or for a heating and cooling service technician to want to do plumbing.” Technicians do ride-alongs with other trades to get hands-on experience. Gold Medal Service conducts training in their facility in its warehouse, using both in-house trainers and factory reps. The firm previously had a dedicated training room, but the equipment inside became outdated so quickly that they scrapped it. In 2016 Gold Medal Service grew from 150 employees to more than 190 employees, increasing its customer base from 100,000 to more than 125,000 customers. The firm increased its annual revenues to more than $28 million, compared with $24 million in 2015. Agugliaro was featured in August 2016 on CNBC’s Nightly Business Report discussing his story and the more than 90 national and international business leaders he has coached over the last four years to help grow their companies. He has spoken at various trade events, including Penton’s Comfortech Conference and Show. He has hosted multiple CEOWarrior events, including Fast Track and Warrior Circle events, and he hosts monthly CEOWarrior podcasts, which consistently get more than 2,000 downloads each. Gold Medal Service has become self-sustaining in a way that allows Agugliaro to spend most of his time teaching other contractors. Most contractors were taught the business by some other guy who didn’t know anything about running a business, he says. They have no formal training in sales or marketing or management. They think that they aren’t successful because they’re too young. They think that they aren’t successful because they’re too old. They’re afraid. They’ve been punched in the face by a bad economy and bad hires.  Why am I here? “We got to the point where the service company had run by itself for two or three years,” Agugliaro recounts. “My partner and I don’t even have an office in the building. So I began to ask myself ‘why am I here’ and it hit me that now I’m in a position to help people and change lives and to make that impact on business owners. It’s better to tell a hurtful truth than a comforting lie. You need to change, to grow, to think different. One of the things that will serve the people who read this is that there’s something they’re already great at, and the goal is for them to figure out what they are not great at and read a book or find a program and learn about whatever they’re bad at and improve themselves.” The warrior part of CEOWarrior comes from martial arts, which Agugliaro has studied since he was 15. He’s 46 now. ‘Focus is understanding the outcome you want to attain and staying on your path with your plan without getting distracted.’ “Martial arts taught me focus, discipline, endurance, and training over and over again,” he says. “It formed me into a strong person. I learned that there’s always another level to strive for; there are higher levels of mastery. One worse [problem for contractors] than fear, the worst disease is lack of focus. If they have focus and discipline, they would achieve anything they want. The situation is worse than ever today. Everybody’s on his phone. The constant distractions are endless today. So you have to have discipline to stay focused. Focus is understanding the outcome you want to attain and staying on your path with your plan without getting distracted.” Contractors need to learn marketing, sales and leadership, he says. There’s no business without marketing. There will be no money without a high-integrity sales process. There will be no wealth unless the contractor is an amazing leader. “Work on becoming better you,” Agugliaro advises. What Gold Medal Service is focusing on for 2017, says Agugliaro, is profitability. It’s “sharpening the axe” and taking its service to the next level of convenience to the customer to strengthen the brand. The team is working now to streamline and improve every single function, delivery of services, training and management. Four core values Gold Medal Service has four core values, he says. Number one is safety first for the contractor’s family and the customer’s. This is an industry in which we work on things that can kill you, like carbon monoxide and electricity. Core value number two is to deliver “Wow Service,” the highest level of customer service experience on the planet. Give the customer the quality of Nordstrom’s, but the emotional experience of Disney. Core value number three is integrity. And number four the company must be a great place to work — all for one and one for all. Don’t ever give up, Agugliaro says, no matter where you are in your business, no matter how old you are. A lot of people at 60 think that they’ll live to be 85 and then be dead. But what if you live to be 100? Better start working now.

Powdersville Walmart Supercenter and FOX Carolina's Surprise Squad teamed up to surprise a family for Christmas--but we had no idea how special the surprise would be. The idea was to help spread some holiday cheer by giving a random stranger a gift card worth $500 for Christmas shopping. FOX Carolina's Joe Gagnon pretended to be a Walmart employee to pick the lucky person. Little did he know, the woman he chose had recently suffered a major loss. "My husband passed away eight months ago," Regina Cameron said, "I haven't had time, this is all last-minute Christmas shopping." Walmart gave $596 to Cameron so she could buy all the things she planned to give her loved ones. She got the Christmas miracle she needed.  Copyright 2016 FOX Carolina (Meredith Corporation).

The spot opens with the fairly obvious insight that while Christmas is an unending source of joy for children everywhere, for adults it’s mostly a major source of stress and anxiety. A handful of such adults are interviewed, who talk about how stressful the holidays are now before fondly recalling childhood memories. Then Jones arrives on the scene and supposedly hypnotizes them into reliving their favorite Christmas moments while a film crew captures the results. When the footage is played back, the participants laugh and cry at footage of them happily looking out at falling snow, ripping open presents, tearing into a drum kit, riding a bike around the living room and otherwise acting like kids again. The spot concludes with the message, “Everyone should feel like a kid at Christmas,” and “Share a happy, healthy holiday.” While that may be a nice sentiment, it’s a far reach to connect it to the brand. It remains to be seen if Jones is an accomplished enough hypnotist to convince the participants that shopping at Walmart is anything other than a stressful clustercuss. But hey, maybe that is the connection.

By Karla Bowsher on December 21, 2016 Photo by pathdoc / Shutterstock.com Walmart is making headlines for announcing it will close at 6 p.m. on Christmas Eve — two hours earlier than in recent years — to give employees more time with their families. Still, a 6 p.m. closing allows the worst of procrastinators ample hours to shop on the last day before Christmas — and Walmart is hardly alone in offering a late closing. We’ve identified seven national retail chains that have formally announced they will stay open until the evening on Christmas Eve.

Here are some last-minute options Published December 21, 2016 Associated Press Facebook0 Twitter0 livefyre Email Print Shoppers fills Macy's in New York City  (AP) NEW YORK –  Holiday shopping procrastinators can breathe easy. Yes, most online shipping deadlines have passed. But many retailers are offering other ways to get gifts at the last minute, whether it's staying open through the wee hours of the night like Toys R Us, or offering Christmas Eve store pickup like Wal-Mart. Here are some options for those still scrambling to buy presents: MIDNIGHT RUNS Many stores are extending their hours in the days leading up to Christmas. Toys R Us will stay open from 6 a.m. on Dec. 23 straight to 9 p.m. on Christmas Eve, while department store Kohl's will stay open from Dec. 20 until Christmas Eve. Certain Macy's department stores will be open all night between Dec. 22 and Dec. 23. Sears will close at midnight through Dec. 23 and close at 6 p.m. on Christmas Eve. And Target will be open from 7 a.m. to midnight through Dec. 23 and stay open until at least 10 p.m. on Christmas Eve. SHOP THE UNEXPECTED If you can't make it to the mall, a quick stop at a drug or specialty store might work. CVS, Walgreens and Rite Aid are increasingly stocking their shelves with more toys for the little ones. And those three drugstores also have a big selection of plastic gift cards for use at other stores, such as video game retailer GameStop or bookseller Barnes & Noble. Meanwhile, office supplies store Staples sells flying drones and adult coloring books. And Dick's Sporting Goods has Apple Watches, headphones and GoPro cameras. STORE PICKUP If you want to avoid searching for items in the store, you're in luck. Many retailers let you buy items online and pick them up at a store the same day. After ordering and paying online, walk to a special section of the store with the confirmation email and ID and that's it. Macy's, Target and Best Buy are just some of the stores that offer store pickup. Wal-Mart says customers who order items before 6 p.m. on Dec. 23 can pick them up on Christmas Eve and even launched a website with the items that qualify at walmart.com/lastminutegifts. And at Sears.com, those who opt for store pickup between now and Christmas Eve can get 20 percent off clothing, jewelry and home goods if they type in a special promo code. SEND AN E-GIFT The websites of some major stores are offering a way to give an instant gift, called an e-gift. It's similar to a gift card, but is supposed to be a little more personal: You choose the item you want to buy — say sneakers or a sweater — click the "E-Gift" or "GiftNow" button, pay, and then the recipient gets an email telling them you bought them a gift. The gift receiver accepts it and can make adjustments, such as changing the color or size, before it ships. Or they can just get something else entirely from the store. Expand / Contract The service carries no extra charges to the gift giver or receiver, and is available on several websites, including Saks Fifth Avenue, Nordstrom and Ralph Lauren. SAME-DAY DELIVERY It will cost you more, but if you're desperate, you can get some items delivered the same day you order them online. Macy's offers same-day delivery in some cities and so does Nordstrom. But be aware, some may not deliver on Christmas Eve, like Nordstrom. If you're an Amazon.com Prime member paying the annual fee, the online retailer is lets shoppers in Miami, New York and other cities order toys, electronics and other gifts as late as 9:45 p.m. on Christmas Eve for delivery in two hours, meaning you'll get it before midnight. OR JUST WAIT Procrastination may work in your favor if you end up not seeing a person you're shopping for until after Christmas. That's when after-holiday sales kick in, says Sara Skirboll, a shopping and trends expert at shopping deal app RetailMeNot. If the timing works, you'll likely pay less for a gift than you would if you had bought it before the holidays, says Skirboll.

A security guard discovered Clifford’s body after midnight Saturday. He was naked and with his genitals had been removed, USA Today reported Tuesday. Fred Duran, a representative from Albuquerque law enforcement, said Miller traveled to New Mexico two months ago in hopes of finding employment in Albuquerque. Local police are still trying to determine what happened to Miller in the days leading up to his grisly death, including the motive. An autopsy on the body is pending. It was not immediately clear whether Miller was decapitated before or after he died.  Investigators do not believe Miller was killed in the same place the security guard discovered his body, but have not said where his death may have occurred. Police said they have a suspect in the investigation and urged anyone with relevant information to alert the authorities. “What we know is that his body was put there by someone, we don’t know who, we don’t know how,” Duran told the New York Daily News. Miller was the father of two girls. His 11-year-old son died in car accident nearly four years ago. Chandel Fults, the sister of Miller’s ex-wife, said most of Miller’s extended family members had been notified about his death by Tuesday and were having a difficult time fathoming it.

Fults said Miller had been working for a roofing company in his hometown of McAlester, Oklahoma, before moving to New Mexico. She said she didn’t know what job Miller traveled to Albuquerque to pursue.  Miller had a history with law enforcement.

 Mobile payments technology and contactless payments explained Andrew Meola Dec. 21, 2016, 3:13 PM 3,747 facebook linkedin twitter email print BII The rise of mobile payments technology truly began in 2014 when Apple Pay hit the market. At the time, it was the only major mobile wallet out there. But in the last two years, mobile wallets have flooded the market with offerings such as Samsung Pay, Chase Pay, Android Pay, Microsoft Wallet, Walmart Pay, and Kohl's Pay. Each of these offers unique benefits to the user and encourages customers to form shopping habits around them. And so far, they seem to be succeeding. BI Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, finds that mobile payment volume will reach $75 billion this year. That figure should swell to $503 billion by 2020 thanks to advancements in mobile payments technology. Below, we've outlined how mobile and contactless payments work and explained the different types of payments technology that are shaping the present and future. What Are Contactless Payments and How Do They Work? To understand how contactless payments work, let's take a hypothetical example. You have an iPhone, which allows you to take advantage of Apple Pay. You input your credit card information onto your phone, which stores it for later use. Later on, you're shopping at a store that has mobile payment readers at the register. Rather than reach for your wallet, you take out your phone and hold it a few inches away from the point-of-sale (POS) terminal. This device then automatically reads the payment information stored on the smart chip embedded in your card and then processes the transaction. Each chip connects to an antenna, and POS terminals emit a high frequency radio wave that facilitates communication between the reader and the phone. When the mobile device is in range, a wireless communication protocol links the terminal and the phone, which exchange information and conduct a secure transaction. All of this occurs in fractions of a second. Near-Field Communication (NFC) Payment Technology Near-field communication, or NFC, technology works by bringing together two electronic devices, typically a mobile device such as a smartphone and a reader of some kind. NFC tech always involves one initiator that generates an RF field to power a passive target. In terms of payments technology, the reader would be the initiator and the smartphone (which contains the stored credit card information) would be the target. The market potential for NFC payment technology is enormous, as merchants have actually been inadvertently rallying behind this type of contactless payment tech. As more U.S. merchants adopt the EMV security standard as of October 1, 2015, they must order new EMV-compliant terminals from major providers such as Verifone and Ingenico. More often than not, these devices accept NFC payments through mobile wallets. In short, EMV will help make NFC technology universal because NFC offers a clear preferred mobile acceptance technology. And this transition is well underway. Verifone said in its Q3 2015 earnings call that NFC terminal penetration had likely reached 100% among top-tier merchants. REUTERS/Beck Diefenbach Bluetooth Payment Technology Bluetooth is a bit of a wild card in the payments industry. Mobile payments technology focuses quite a bit on NFC, and with good reason. But Bluetooth could be the true transformer in this area. All the major mobile platform developers, such as Apple, Google, Microsoft, and BlackBerry have supported Bluetooth for the last several years, but they shifted focus to NFC in the payments world as they released their mobile wallets (Apple Pay, Android Pay, etc.). Bluetooth, however, could change the game. Mobile payments such as Apple Pay have been slow to catch on in certain areas, but Bluetooth likely would not have such problems, especially because it has some inherent advantages. For starters, Bluetooth has a much longer range than NFC, as it can reach up to 50 meters compared to NFC's need to have the two devices centimeters away from each other. This longer range could reduce friction during the checkout process even more than NFC technology already does. On top of this, Bluetooth creates a truly hands-free experience because shoppers would not even need to take out their phones to tap them to a reader.  Furthermore, Bluetooth payment processing is almost always faster than NFC, even if it's by fractions of a second. And finally, NFC is limited to one-to-one interaction, as in one mobile device and one payments reader. But Bluetooth can facilitate multiple transactions at once from a single payments terminal, which would further speed up the checkout process. More to Learn Mobile payments technology will evolve in numerous ways in the coming years, but this is just one piece of the much larger and more complex payments ecosystem.

File photo by John Sleezer jsleezer@kcstar.com i By Tony Rizzo trizzo@kcstar.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story The Johnson County district attorney has ruled that Olathe police officers did not violate Kansas law in the fatal shooting of a man last month outside a Wal-Mart store. Walter Echols was fatally shot Nov. 27 outside a Wal-Mart near Santa Fe Street and Kansas 7. Police said that Echols, 50, of Cypress, Texas, was armed with a blunt object during a disturbance outside the store. One officer was struck by the object, and officers attempted to subdue Echols by nonlethal means before he was shot, according to police. District Attorney Steve Howe said Wednesday in a written statement that after reviewing reports of the county’s multijurisdictional team that investigates officer-involved shootings, he determined that the use of deadly force by officers was justified under Kansas law.

Justin Barkley, 38, accused of murdering William Schumacher, 52, of Candor on Dec. 8, attempted to plead guilty to the charge on Monday in Tompkins County Court but Judge John C. Rowley declined to accept the plea after Barkley claimed he killed Trump, according to The Ithaca Voice. “I shot and killed Donald Trump purposely, intentionally and very proudly,” Barkley said, according to The Voice.

Assistant District Attorney Eliza Filipowski requested that Barkley’s mental state be examined by psychiatrists to see if he is competent to stand trial, The Voice reported. Barkley previously admitted to shooting a man in the chest with a .30-06 caliber rifle. He also “stated that he had intentionally driven over the body of the victim and spun his tires, before subsequently being involved in a brief pursuit with the police behind him.” Leaderboard 2 <a href="http://oncampusweb-d.openx.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=d282f4125a&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" ><img src="http://oncampusweb-d.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=538220188&cs=d282f4125a&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" border="0" alt=""></a> When Barkley allegedly pulled into the driveway of his Dryden Road home, police say he fired a shot at officers who were pursuing him. In the complaint, Barkley describes that shot as a “sound shot” intended “to prevent the police officers from exiting their patrol vehicles.” The Voice reported that Barkley has also been charged with menacing a police officer or peace officer — a felony. Police took Barkley into custody shortly before 10 a.m. when he walked out of his front door after negotiators used a robot to safely communicate with him. Witnesses had previously told The Sun at the scene of the murder that a white man in a black truck had calmly shot and then run over the UPS driver, later identified as Schumacher. John Thorna, of Newfield, said he heard a single gunshot and looked up to see a UPS driver fall to the ground about 200 feet from Walmart. He said he hadn’t heard any argument or shouting before the gunshot. “A guy was sitting in his truck, and all I heard was a gunshot and looked up, saw the guy fall, and then the guy in the truck backed up, pulled out, ran him over and took off,” he said. The victim was “walking out of the store and the other guy seemed like he was in the truck waiting for him,” Thorna added. Barkley said he knew where Trump would be on the night of the murder and had camped out in the parking lot planning to assassinate him, The Voice reported. Barkley is currently being held in Tompkins County Jail without bail. His next court appearance is Jan. 6 at 2 p.m. Barkley’s attorney, James Baker, could not immediately be reached on Wednesday.

Related Psychiatric Examiners Disagree Over Competency of Alleged Walmart Murderer By Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs 5 hours ago The third examination will begin next week, Assistant District Attorney Eliza Filipowski said. Rowley also scheduled a hearing for later in January to discuss the “conflicting reports.” Ithaca Residents React to Recent City Shooting By Brendan Doyle January 21, 2009 When residents of First Street saw part of their neighborhood being sectioned off with police tape, their emotions ranged from weariness to genuine shock. In a community that is home to a day care center and several houses, a shooting earlier this month was simply too close for comfort. According to neighbors, the police surrounded a nondescript house on the 300 block of First Street on the evening of Jan. 8, where the suspect and several other people exited and were later taken into custody. The shooter was later identified as Caesar Young, 52, of New York City. The victim suffered no fatal injuries. “I was shocked to find out about it,” said Michael Salmines, a music teacher who lives on the corner of the 100 block of First Street. 3 thoughts on “Man Accused of Walmart Murder Says He Killed Donald Trump” What Else Is New on December 23, 2016 at 10:38 pm said: A delusional leftist, how surprising.

There are 180 tech companies circling the runway with valuations over $1 billion, the most in history. While interest in an all-expenses paid trip to the NYSE valuation guillotine was at an all-time low, non-traditional Fortune 500 companies did pluck a lucky few from the skies at very serious valuations. Moving into 2017, there’s little indication that trend is going to do anything but accelerate, especially given that every company is now essentially a software company. First came the venture arms, then came the open source projects — now Fortune 500 companies are starting to embrace the idea of fully acquiring very mature tech startups. Walmart’s $3 billion acquisition of Jet.com in August gave hope to unicorn founders that big wins aren’t merely a relic of the past. Continuing into November, the insurance, automotive and consumer goods industries all showed a preference for tech, according to a new report from CB Insights. Data is limited because billion-plus-dollar acquisitions aren’t really a commonplace occurrence, but it’s safe to say that the aforementioned acquisitions generally fall into two categories. Most commonly, traditional players are looking to access new demographics. This was the case with Jet, Dollar Shave Club and to some extent SquareTrade. Walmart’s e-commerce business has been eaten alive by Amazon in recent years, Unilever is getting cornered by a streamlined competitor preaching convenience and Allstate is struggling to get its message across to a millennial generation that has only previously bought insurance for their smartphones. On the other side of the spectrum, some companies, particularly in the automotive sector, are just struggling to keep up. The shift to electric and autonomous vehicles is occurring at roughly the same time, and it is proving to be a challenge for traditional manufacturers. While most of us were not paying attention, major automakers relocated their research and development centers to Silicon Valley and swung out venture arms to start brushing elbows with software engineers. As software continues to eat its way through the world, companies like General Motors have realized that cold hard cash for acquisitions may be the most efficient means of playing catch-up. This comes as mere startups, like Uber, have reached valuations that have surpassed legacy automakers like GM. If 2017 holds to expectations, we will see a greater number of tech IPOs and acquisitions, particularly from non-traditional buyers. It wouldn’t be hard to imagine a startup like Quanergy Systems, which builds LiDAR technology, being acquired by an automotive parts manufacturer looking to cut the corner on innovation like Delphi Automotive. It also wouldn’t surprise me if a strong brand like The Honest Company got picked up by Proctor & Gamble or if a major retailer like Target acquired Fanatics. This is to say nothing of the myriad acquisitions of tech companies with valuations under $1 billion, increasing M&A activity of international companies and the potential for Trump to add fuel to the fire with lower taxes and reduced regulatory oversight.

Anyone who knew Eddie Chandler remembers what a loving giving heart he had. Scott states he had stopped by to get Jason Sanders to put air in his tires, when Eddie asked him if he had any old bicycles. At the time the only one Scott had was for his own children. Scott liked the idea Eddie had of trying to get less fortunate children at Christmas a new bicycle. He shared with Eddie that Frank’s Flea Market was the only place close they might be able to get a few. Which of course purchased several. They still needed more so off to WalMart they went to purchase maybe 10-15, Scott could not remember the exact amount. They stood outside Wal Mart with people stopping and asking about the bikes. Seeing the need of different ones inquiring, they begin to give to those who really needed a bike. Thus began the Eddie Chandler Christmas Bicycle Give Away! The name was not officially given until after Eddie passed away 3 years ago. The second year brought more of an opportunity for Eddie and Scott as The City of Lanett had impounded about 70 bicycles. With this the two were able to go to Wa Mart and purchase more for the give away. The third year Eddie became very ill and before passing away, he asked Scott to please continue the Bicycle give away. Now, Scott Willingham is fulfilling Eddie Chandler’s dream. This is a tough job to take on by yourself so a long time friend who was also involved in the give away, Charles Story had joined forces to keep this dream alive. By the 4th year and sharing on social media, the Eddie Chandler Christmas Bicycle Give Away grew even bigger, adding helmets to the list, therefore, the Chambers County Sheriff’s Department Work Detail crew began to assemble the bikes. The duo enlisted Christian Services in Lanett, ensuring distribution of the bicycles be given to families with a need. Cheryl Myers keeps records of previous donations each year making it much easier for the duo. Donations began to roll in making purchasing the bicycles and helmets a little easier but the need for more was still there. This year Scott and Charles shared they were so thankful to the donations and support from their hometown and surrounding area.. If you knew Eddie Chandler and you spent some time with him you would know he had an” infectious ” personality and hanging around him you would want to help in every way possible. Charles also added “Eddie had a lot of faith in Scott and his humbleness with a desire to help others” as we sat in McDonald’s the two pointed to where Eddie always sat, sharing McDonalds was always his office. The two are looking forward to 2017 and their 6th year of carrying on the legacy of Eddie Chandler.. This season is coming to a close so the two are already making plans for next year. If you would like to participate in the Eddie Chandler Christmas Bicycle Give Away you can contact Scott at 706-518-7743 or Charles 706-773-0742.

Shopping 5 0 0 December 21, 2016 2016 Christmas Hours: What Hours Are Stores And Restaurants Open On Christmas Eve? Danny Cox Christmas 2016 is right around the corner and there really aren’t many days left to pick up any gifts you may need, get presents wrapped, or grab food items needed for dinner. A large number of retailers have chosen against being open at all on the holiday, and more are joining them every single year. Leading up to it, though, many have extended their hours so you can get everything done that you need. Still, Christmas Eve 2016 will have different hours so make sure you know which stores and restaurants are open. Your best bet for getting last-minute shopping done is to do it before Christmas Eve, but there are those times you end up forgetting something. If you need to head out for something, please know that most stores are only open until 9 p.m. at the latest and that doesn’t mean all of them will be. One store being open at the mall doesn’t mean another retailer will be open down the road. [Image by Kena Betancur/Getty Images] Here are the big-time hours you need to know for Christmas Eve 2016 and what time stores will be open until for the last-minute shoppers. Store Business Hours has confirmed that Walmart stores will be closing at 8 p.m. local time again this year on Christmas Eve, and many others are letting employees go home early as well. Academy Sports + Outdoors: 7 a.m. – 6 p.m. Best Buy: 8 a.m. – 6 p.m. BJ’s Wholesale: 9 a.m. – 9 p.m. Costco: 9 a.m. – 5 p.m. Dillards: Open until 6 p.m. GameStop: 8 a.m. – 7 p.m. Hobby Lobby: 9 a.m. – 5:30 p.m. JCPenney: 7 a.m. – 6 p.m. (Some stores not opening until 9 a.m.) Kmart: 8 a.m. – 10 p.m. Kohl’s: Open until 6 p.m. Macy’s: 7 a.m. – 8 p.m. (Some stores closing at 6 p.m.) Office Depot/Office Max: 8 a.m. – 9 p.m. (Some stores closing at 6 p.m.) Sears: Open until 10 p.m. Target: Open until 11 p.m. Toys ‘R’ Us: Open until 9 p.m. (Some locations open until 11 p.m.) Walmart: Open until 8 p.m. While those stores will help those looking for gifts and presents, those needing to get something for their big holiday meal will need to know when it’s too late. Should you need to get some main meals or side dishes, know that places such as Aldi have posted much earlier closing hours than usual on Christmas Eve. Again, remember that hours can change per location and city, so always call ahead to be sure that these hours apply to your local store. Albertsons: 8 a.m. – 8 p.m. Aldi: 8 a.m. – 6 p.m. CVS: Open until 10 p.m. Food Giant: Open until 6 p.m. H-E-B: 6 a.m. – 8 p.m. Kroger: Open until 6 p.m. Publix: Open until 7 p.m. Rite Aid: Open until 7 p.m. (Hours can vary per location) Walgreens: Open until midnight Whole Foods: 8 a.m. – 6 p.m. Winn-Dixie: Open until 10 p.m. (Some locations open until midnight) [Image by Spencer Platt/Getty Images] Pay close attention to the time while you’re out shopping as you don’t want to get hungry and end up at a place you don’t even like. There won’t be a lot of locations with late hours, so be sure that you don’t get stuck without a meal on Christmas Eve. Some places like Domino’s Pizza know that many dining locations close early on Christmas Eve and they are looking to appeal to late-nighters by offering Christmas pizza delivery. Be sure to check with every single location because those which are franchised out can choose their own hours and don’t always abide by company standards. Here are the restaurant hours to keep in mind for when Christmas Eve arrives on Saturday: Applebee’s: Open until 9 p.m. (Some locations open until 2 a.m.) Boston Market: Open until 10 p.m. Buca di Beppo: 11 a.m. – 11 p.m. Buffalo Wild Wings: Open until 6 p.m. Burger King: Open until midnight (Some locations open until 10 p.m.) Cracker Barrel: 6 a.m. – 2 p.m. Denny’s: 24/7 Domino’s: Open until 3 a.m. (Carryout may end earlier) Dunkin’ Donuts: Open until 6 p.m. Golden Corral: Vary by location IHOP: 24/7 for most locations, but some may be 6 a.m. – midnight Jack in the Box: Regular hours per location McDonald’s: Open until 10 p.m. (Will vary by location) Outback Steakhouse: Open until 11 p.m. Panda Express: Open until 10 p.m. Perkins: Open until 2 a.m. Pizza Hut: Open until 8 p.m. Ruby Tuesday: Hours to vary per location Ruth’s Chris Steak House: 4:30 p.m. – 10 p.m. Sizzler: 7 a.m. – 10 p.m. Starbucks Coffee: Locations vary between closing at 10 p.m. or 12 a.m. Steak and Shake: 24/7 Subway: Open until 10 p.m. Taco Bell: Hours vary by location Waffle House: 24/7 Knowing all of this information, you are now prepared to head out and shop on Christmas Eve 2016. You are fully aware of the stores that are open and what hours they will be available for you to shop in them. Dining on Christmas Eve is a bit more limited as many locations will close much earlier than some retail stores and supermarkets/groceries close even earlier. Get your things in order early this week and maybe you won’t even have to go out on the day before Christmas.

And too many Americans are one job loss or medical crisis away from food insecurity. Feeding America, the largest nonprofit in the U.S. focused on hunger, has established a network of 200 food banks that’s working to serve three to four billion meals a year to 49 million people in America. “The problem is that they need to be able to serve eight billion meals,” says Neal Myrick, director of social impact at Tableau and head of the Tableau Foundation. “So there’s a tremendous meal gap, between what they’re able to serve and what the need is.” And to do that, Myrick says, real-time data is increasingly essential. “It’s being used more and more to put actionable information in the hands of decision-makers,” he explains. Historically, he says, non-profits have collected data over long stretches of time and evaluated it in traditional backward-looking measurement and evaluation exercises. “The shift that we’re seeing now is that the data is actually being collected in near real time and being used to make decisions and assess program success on a more active and frequent basis,” Myrick says. “At Feeding America, they’re using data to get more food into their supply chain.” The data they pull in from third-party vendors and local grocery stores gives food bank staff insight into donation capacities. “It helps give them a basic understanding of how much the grocery store procures and then how much they sell,” says Myrick. “And they can calculate what that grocery store’s potential donation could be.” For example, they can see that the local Walmart is donating five thousand pounds of food, but the math shows they have the capacity to donate ten thousand. “And what that allows the local food bank manager to do is go have a conversation with that Walmart,” Myrick says. “They brainstorm ideas for how they can get from donating five thousand pounds to donating ten thousand pounds, and get more food into the supply chain for Feeding America to distribute.” Real-time data, transformed into visualizations, are also essential for helping non-profits who are always operating on razor-thin margins, Myrick says. All 200 food banks collect data on twelve specific operating metrics; pooled and visualized, Feeding America has an essential tool at their fingertips. “I can compare myself with other rural food banks around the country on these twelve metrics and I can see where I’m underperforming, I can see where I’m overperforming,” Myrick says. “And what we’re hearing is that having that visibility is encouraging collaboration among the food banks. If I see somebody able to deliver a meal for 25 cents, that gives me an immediate thing to put into my road map and set an objective. And I can call the food bank that’s achieving the 25 and find out what they’re doing to achieve that.” The combination of near-live data and visualization is what powers the ability to stay on top of potential savings and effective strategies. “Imagine having to look through a set of Excel spreadsheets and having to eyeball numbers,” Myrick says. “It’s hard to really have perspective unless you can see yourself in the context of other organizations that are like you. The visualization gives you the ability to instantly see what you should be focused on, and also drill in and get more information.” In the non profit world, where organizations lack the kinds of resources that the business world has, and more than likely don’t have data scientists on hand, visualization is critical for effectiveness and efficiency. Tableau is bringing together its entire community to help nonprofits overcome the resource gap, Myrick says. “Skills and capacity are definitely an obstacle,” he says. “That’s why we invest our entire ecosystem — our employees, our business partners, and our customers all get invited to partner with us to build skills and capacity in the nonprofit sector. We actually teach the nonprofits and build their capacity to use data.” Tableau is also busy breaking down barriers in the nonprofit sector that often slow down or obstruct work on the ground, particularly how data is collected and where it’s delivered. “We’re seeing a shift now. When the data is collected in real time, it can be used more operationally by the nonprofits to make better and smarter decisions on an ongoing basis,” Myrick says. “What we’re finding is we’re enabling people to use real-time data to make better decisions; they actually need to be able to pivot and change directions when the data are showing that what they thought was going to work isn’t working as well as something else.” And in the case of some nonprofits Tableau is working with, like the World Food Programme which is meeting the needs of food-insecure people in conflict and crisis areas struggling to meet their basic needs,  Tableau is also working to deliver food price information back down to local program managers. These on-the-ground aid workers have never before had access to this type of real-time information which is now helping them make informed decisions on the best way to help. “The community is actually benefiting from the data collection exercise,” Myrick says, “and we’re super excited about that.” It’s the future of real-time data for nonprofits, Myrick says. “Data used to be collected to be used by funders, by researchers, and by experts,” he explains. “And especially in low-income and underserved communities in developing countries, the data was really kind of extracted from the community for the benefit of the wealthy.” And those communities oftentimes weren’t able to benefit from the data in return. “What I’m really excited about is we are seeing a shift,” says Myrick. “Part of the responsible use of data is to deliver value back to the community so the community can benefit from the data, not just the funders or the governments or whoever is requiring the data to be collected.” Tableau’s work is keeping that shift in motion. “There are lots of tools out there like Tableau and others that are easy enough to use now where community members can actually not only just get big data sets, but get data delivered in a visual way,” he says. “They can actually make use of it without having to go through weeks and weeks of schooling to figure it out.” “Putting more information and power into the hands of the community is something that we’re super excited about,” he adds. And it’s already changing the world. Beyond nonprofit: Learn more about real-time data in our recent VB Live event.

In the letter, which you can see below, FOP national president Chuck Canterbury writes, “At a time of year when we as a nation and indeed, as a world, should be coming together in hopes of peace on Earth and goodwill toward men, these third party sellers are profiting from racial division. Commercializing our differences will not help our local police and communities to build greater trust and respect for one another.” Walmart sent a statement to CNNMoney in response that says, “Like other online retailers, we have a marketplace with millions of items offered by third parties that includes Blue Lives Matter, Black Lives Matter and All Lives Matter merchandise. After hearing concerns from customers, we are removing the specific item with the ‘bulletproof’ reference.” But those appear to be the only items they are taking down. There is still apparel with “Black Lives Matter” on them on Walmart’s website, as well as some with “Blue Lives Matter” printed on.

See Offers Business Posted December 21, 2016 increase font size Last-minute shopping options If you haven't finished getting gifts for those on your holiday list, it's time to think outside the box. Associated Press Share Comment Read Article NEW YORK — Holiday shopping procrastinators can breathe easy. Yes, most online shipping deadlines have passed. But many retailers are offering other ways to get gifts at the last minute, whether it’s staying open through the wee hours of the night like Toys R Us, or offering Christmas Eve store pickup like Wal-Mart. Here are some options for those still scrambling to buy presents: For those still scrambling to buy presents, many stores – including Toys R Us, Kohl's, Macy's and Target – are extending their hours in the remaining days before Christmas. Associated Press/Elise Amendola Search photos available for purchase: Photo Store → MIDNIGHT RUNS Many stores are extending their hours in the days leading up to Christmas. Toys R Us will stay open from 6 a.m. Dec. 23 straight to 9 p.m. on Christmas Eve, while department store Kohl’s will stay open from Dec. 20 until Christmas Eve. Certain Macy’s department stores will be open all night between Dec. 22 and 23. Sears will close at midnight through Dec. 23 and at 6 p.m. Christmas Eve. And Target will be open from 7 a.m. to midnight through Dec. 23 and stay open until at least 10 p.m. on Christmas Eve. SHOP THE UNEXPECTED If you can’t make it to the mall, a quick stop at a drug or specialty store might work. CVS, Walgreens and Rite Aid are increasingly stocking their shelves with more toys for the little ones. And those three drugstores also have a big selection of plastic gift cards for use at other stores, such as video game retailer GameStop or bookseller Barnes & Noble. Meanwhile, office supplies store Staples sells flying drones and adult coloring books. And Dick’s Sporting Goods has Apple Watches, headphones and GoPro cameras. STORE PICKUP If you want to avoid searching for items in the store, you’re in luck. Many retailers let you buy items online and pick them up at a store the same day. After ordering and paying online, walk to a special section of the store with the confirmation email and ID and that’s it. Macy’s, Target and Best Buy are just some of the stores that offer store pickup. Wal-Mart says customers who order items before 6 p.m. Dec. 23 can pick them up on Christmas Eve and even launched a website with the items that qualify at walmart.com/lastminutegifts. And at Sears.com, those who opt for store pickup between now and Christmas Eve can get 20 percent off clothing, jewelry and home goods if they type in a special promo code. SEND AN E-GIFT The websites of some major stores are offering a way to give an instant gift, called an e-gift. It’s similar to a gift card, but is supposed to be a little more personal: You choose the item you want to buy – say sneakers or a sweater – click the “E-Gift” or “GiftNow” button, pay, and then the recipient gets an email telling him you bought him a gift. The gift receiver accepts it and can make adjustments, such as changing the color or size, before it ships. Or she can just get something else entirely from the store. The service carries no extra charges to the gift giver or receiver, and is available on several websites, including Saks Fifth Avenue, Nordstrom and Ralph Lauren.

Home Archives Ed Morrissey Show Newsletters   New York man still believes he shot and killed “Donald Trump” posted at 9:21 am on December 21, 2016 by Jazz Shaw Share on Facebook 1 1 SHARES This is one of those “local news” stories which probably wouldn’t have made it outside the confines of a couple of counties were it not for an odd twist. A UPS driver was tragically shot and killed in Ithaca, New York a couple of weeks ago, not far from where I live. In a time of rising violent crime rates this is horrible for the victim’s family, but sadly not all that unusual. The strange part came when the suspect was ready and willing to confess to the crime. He informed the police that he had no regrets because he’d done the world a great service by murdering President Elect Donald Trump. (Ithaca Voice) An Ithaca man accused of killing a UPS driver from Candor said in court Monday afternoon that not only did he believe he shot and killed Donald Trump, but that no evidence could be presented to him to suggest otherwise. Justin R. Barkley, 38, said during his arraignment and subsequent attempt to plead guilty, “I shot and killed Donald Trump purposely, intentionally and very proudly.” He told the court that he knew where president elect Donald Trump would be on Dec. 8 and waited in the Ithaca Walmart parking lot kill him. “I went there to purposely shoot and kill him and put him down,” Barkley said. So he was familiar with Donald Trump’s schedule and knew that he would be at the Walmart in Ithaca… driving a UPS truck. There are two possibilities which inevitably come to mind when you hear this story. The first is that Barkley knew precisely what he was doing and either had some animus against the driver or perhaps was looking to rob the delivery truck and the situation spiraled out of control. Then, having been caught in the act, he comes up with some wacky story to begin building an insanity defense. But the results of the initial police investigation seem to indicate that he had no idea who William Schumacher (the driver) was and the two had no shared history. Also, there’s no mention of any packages being stolen or disturbed as you might expect to find in a robbery scenario. So what about the insanity defense idea? Barkley was offered the chance to either make that case or, at a minimum, admit that he had shot Schumacher in a case of mistaken identity. No dice. The shooter told the judge that he knew precisely what he had done (that being the assassination of the President Elect) and was ready to plead guilty to it. When he was asked if there was any evidence the court might offer to prove that the victim was not Trump and that the next president was in fact still alive, Barkley indicated that there was not. The judge refused to accept his guilty plea, at least for the time being. This case has been covered on TV where I live and it may turn out to be a fairly rare instance of something being precisely what it seems. While I tend to cast a dim view on insanity defense pleas in many cases, I’m starting to think that this guy is actually insane. And I mean seriously loony tunes. If he’s that disconnected from reality, perhaps he needs a long stretch in some sort of mental institution rather than just being shipped off to jail. If we did that he’d probably think he was being sent to Mars. Either way, our thoughts and prayers go out to the Schumacher family and their friends. This was indeed a senseless, tragic murder.

Clifford Miller, 42, of McAlester, Okla., was found decapitated, naked and his genitals removed behind a dumpster near the chain store on Saturday just after midnight, according to the Albuquerque Police Department. Investigators did not confirm a motive for the grisly killing. However, they do not believe Miller was killed in the same area where a security guard discovered his mutilated body. “What we know is that his body was put there by someone, we don’t know who, we don’t know how,” Officer Fred Duran told the Daily News.

(DANIEL BECERRIL/REUTERS) Duran said the victim recently came to New Mexico from Oklahoma in hopes of finding a job. The medical examiner’s office will conduct an autopsy to determine Miller’s cause of death. Police do not have a suspect as the investigation is ongoing, he said, adding that anyone with leads should come forward. Miller’s family did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Journal Published 7:54 p.m. ET Dec. 20, 2016 | Updated 8:36 p.m. ET Dec. 20, 2016 Ithaca mayor Svante Myrick credited all of the police departments who helped bring Thursday's standoff to a peaceful end. (Photo: Matt Weinstein / staff photo) ITHACA, N.Y. — The Dryden man accused of killing a UPS driver in the parking lot of an Ithaca Walmart claimed in court Monday he believed he shot and killed President-elect Donald Trump. Justin Barkley, 38, was in Tompkins County Court on Monday to plead guilty to the murder of 52-year-old Candor resident William Schumacher on Dec. 8 outside the Walmart store at 135 Fairgrounds Memorial Parkway in Ithaca. Judge John Rowley did not accept the plea following Barkley’s comments about Trump and adjourned the indictment to Jan. 6. Rowley also ordered Barkley to be evaluated to determine whether he is competent to stand trial. USA TODAY NYC mayor wants $35 million for Trump Tower security Prosecutors say the Dryden resident intentionally caused the death of Schumacher — the two men were strangers — early Dec. 8. Barkley was indicted last week in Tompkins County Court on felony counts of second-degree murder and menacing a police officer or peace officer. After fleeing from the scene, court papers say, Barkley fired a "sound shot" from his rifle to keep law enforcement officers from coming after him once he pulled into the driveway of his Dryden Road home. After a nearly eight-hour standoff, Barkley was taken into custody without a struggle and no injuries to himself or police. Justin Barkley  (Photo: Ithaca Police Department) If convicted, he faces a maximum penalty of 25 years to life in state prison. Schumacher was a seasonal UPS driver who had stopped to get something to eat during his overnight shift, according to Susan Rosenberg, a spokeswoman for the Atlanta-based package delivery company. He was about four weeks into his second stint as a seasonal driver of a tractor-trailer hauling packages between UPS processing hubs, she said. A suspected motive in the crime remains undisclosed by law enforcement officials, though court records indicate Barkley confessed to the murder after being taken into custody. The homicide took place shortly before 1 a.m., and court papers describe a relatively quiet late night around the Walmart store, with some customers picking up merchandise or waiting in their cars, moments before they heard gunfire.

The environmental group, World Wildlife Fund (WWF aka World Wide Fund for Nature), seeks to fundamentally change the entire beef industry through the GRSB. WWF's website states that they are a founding member of the GRSB and are "actively involved in the newly established U.S. Roundtable for Sustainable Beef and Canadian Roundtable for Sustainable Beef as well as related pilot projects to develop key sustainability indicators and methods to verify sustainable beef." Their goal is to transform the beef supply chain by influencing the "companies [which] control twenty- five percent of all fifteen of the most significant commodities that threaten biodiversity" (Clay, 2010). The WWF claims beef and biofuels are two of these threatening commodities. (Clay, 2010). A 2012 WWF press release listed GRSB founding members as "AllFlex, Cargill, Elanco, Grupo de Trabalho da Pecuaria Sustentavel (GTPS), JBS, McDonald's, Merck Animal Health, National Wildlife Federation, Rainforest Alliance, Roundtable for Sustainable Beef Australia, Solidaridad, The Nature Conservancy, Walmart and World Wildlife Fund." The 2014 UN's Climate Summit Agriculture Action One-Year Report recognized McDonald's commitment to "holistically transform the entire beef value chain". In 2015, the WWF listed Cargill and McDonald's as two of their largest corporate partners. Advertisement In a 2011 BEEF Issues Quarterly interview, WWF Senior V.P. of Markets, Jason Clay stated: "We've come to a time where a farmer or rancher can't simply . . . point to their own performance and show how good they are and expect to somehow avoid the ire of people who look at the whole system." Clay classified producers at the "top" as those belonging to beef organizations. "I think NGOs and producers working together can figure out how to move the top . . . [while] government's role is probably to move the bottom . . . And that's where regulation has to come in." Clay continued, "Many people have a vested interest in beef, whether they're the customers of particular companies, whether they're civil society more broadly, whether it's researchers, government officials, NGOs. I think all of them have a role to play. But this transition won't occur in a vacuum and it won't just be shaped by ranchers. In fact the question that I would say is before us all, is will it even be mostly shaped by ranchers?" At TED Global 2010, Clay addressed whether producers should have to provide proof of sustainable production in order to sell beef to suppliers and whether sustainability is a pre-competitive issue. In 2014, Clay wrote, "Simply put, sustainability is a pre- competitive issue." (WWF, Fall 2014). In 2010, Clay said, "If sustainability is a pre- competitive issue, then we need collusion to address it." (Clay, 2010, 8:30). Collusion? Webster's Dictionary provides a single definition for collusion: a "secret agreement or cooperation especially for an illegal or deceitful purpose." Clay speculated that, "we can actually impact 40-50 percent of global [beef] production by working with a carefully selected group." (Clay, 2010). A conclusion reached after he observed the failure of the organic movement to transition all of agricultural to organic production. He felt they had relied on a group too large to adequately "inform" - 6.9 billion consumers. Clay estimated they could impact the entire beef supply chain by focusing on the smallest group, packers and retailers. "If we change those companies [that control 70 of trade for the 15 identified commodities] and the way they do business, then the rest will happen automatically." As for any companies that didn't agree to participate, they would "twist arms" and "use whatever leverage we have available to bring them to the table." (Clay, 2010). In Brazil, the Nature Conservancy (TNC) is also working towards transformation. "A victory here could ignite global change in beef production." TNC's theory involves developing a sustainable livestock plan while utilizing their "expertise in satellite imagery mapping systems to help the government monitor land use and Forest Code compliance . . . [TNC] is working with Wal-Mart in Brazil to buy meat from Marfrig, who only buys from deforestation-free ranches." (TNC, n.d.). The real threat to sustainability for American ranchers is excessive government regulation under the Endangered Species Act and the Environmental Protection Agency. Other issues impacting American ranchers and farmers are the estate tax, rising land values, urban encroachment, manipulation of the live cattle market, and lack of protection and labeling for USA-raised beef. Meanwhile, government funded NGOs operate freely, largely without accountability, with agendas aimed directly at dismantling the free enterprise of the American beef industry. Can the WWF be trusted to determine the amount of Earth's total resources or accurately predict the future? The big problem with the sustainability agenda, is the lengthy track record of failed environmental predictions. In the 1970s, environmental science claimed Earth would soon enter an ice age due to manmade global cooling, basing their models on temperatures trends. Another consensus reached through "sound" science predicted the Earth's inability to support an estimated population of 7 billion by 2000. The projected 7 billion wasn't reached until 2012 with the earth still supporting human life today. Scientists claimed mass starvation worldwide was to occur by the year 2000 with only North America, Africa and Western Europe unaffected. Additionally, natural resources like oil, nickel and copper were predicted to be depleted by the year 2000. Yet recent fracking has made it possible to access new oil reserves in shale formations. Mass extinction hasn't occurred, Earth hasn't run out of oxygen or sunlight, and acid rain hasn't fallen from the sky. The only consistency in their science, is the apocalyptic view that the Earth is doomed at the hands of man and they alone know how to save it. When their science fails, they swing the other way as is evident with the current claim of global warming. All the while, groups like the WWF ignore trends in climate, populations, and agriculture production that don't fit their agenda. They further ignore ever-advancing human innovation and ingenuity, which has elevated agriculture production to unprecedented levels. Representation of concepts related to the earth's sustainability, as undisputed scientific fact, undermines science itself. The names of industry organizations involved in these roundtables are used as endorsements to further the WWF's agenda. Through participation, organizations suggest an acceptance of the opinion that current beef production is not sustainable in some way. An opinion with which many multigenerational ranchers disagree. The sheer coexistence of nature and ranching for centuries disproves that beef is a threat to biodiversity. To the contrary, ever-improving, thriving ranches indicate that cattle are healthy contributors to the biodiversity of the environment in which they live. Despite environmental propaganda, and in the face of demeaning rhetoric questioning their intelligence, ranchers as a whole continue to be most excellent stewards of the land on which their livelihoods depend. Like many so-called "locally" and "stakeholder" driven initiatives, the GRSB and national roundtables were not created due to consumer demand, but rather by environmental organizations who seek to control what is not theirs. Clay laid out the plan at TED Global 2010, identifying the target companies, WalMart, McDonalds, JBS, Cargil, and others, then helped found the GRSB and national roundtables. Clay's complete presentation can be found on www.youtube.com or www.ted.com (video and transcript). The beef industry should not sit at any table with environmentalists who use greenwashing and collusion to get what they want. It is more pressing than ever to become well educated about the agenda of these "stakeholders" and to speak up as producers to policymakers and industry leaders about the collusion taking place in our industry. The Colorado Independent CattleGrowers Association's mission is to actively promote policy that will beneficially affect the live cattle industry at the local, state and national level, securing and preserving a viable livelihood for present and future generations. The Association shall serve to support the financial, environmental, cultural and historical interests of independent cattle producers throughout Colorado and across America.

Recently at the Team Cornwall Kool Aid drinking party a screen cap was projected with an image from a story by Veteran Journalist David Reevely of the Ottawa Citizen which referred to information that the Cornwall Sector had lost 5,000 residents during a period of time.      CITIZEN STORY LINK It’s traditional in journalism, even Gonzo journalism, to back up your facts.   CFN reached out to Mr. Reevely who responded to a few of our questions.  A call out to Councilor Towndale and the rest of council led to zero responses.  Peter Gault, President of Team Cornwall still hasn’t returned our call from last week. Then again, this newspaper, which has the highest amount of viewers in the market, and is locally owned, was not invited to the Team Cornwall AGM either.   Peter Gault and friends seem to be hypersensitive to any criticism or are too deeply up Bob Peter’s nether regions to hear their phone when it’s ringing? The youthful Towndale, who while meaning well, sometimes seems to cater to the local establishment far too deeply for someone so young, also reached out to Editor Hugo Rodrigues as the Standard Freeholder is also owned by Post Media. @JTowndale To tie this off, if he had reached out with the same data table, I wouldn’t have challenged it, given it’s CMA, not city proper — Hugo Rodrigues (@HugoAPRodrigues) December 21, 2016 Of course, this is a now a city with no public art gallery or real tourism or cultural sector.  In other words we’re losing our youth and those that are most important to a vital successful community and becoming a senior’s residence.   Bragging about saving money on community agencies is shameful and something not to be proud of.  That $45K would have kept the Art Gallery in Cornwall alive for a year. Even more oddly, sacred cow, Aultsville Theatre was moved from that envelope to Economic Development, and is now protected from the scrutiny of council directly.  Again, why is the city kicking in $100K to essentially subsidize the auditorium of St. Lawrence College?   This is again taxation without representation.    That amount of money could fund the purchase of, or help maintain a city owned facility as opposed to the weird failure and tax drain that Aultsville has been.    The same for the Woodhouse museum’s even larger budget.   The city has now apparently capped outside agency requests to $25K except for those entities.  Again, why? Community Agencies Committee has finished it’s work. $45,000 under budget. Savings to be passed along to main budget. #cwlpoli — Justin Towndale (@JTowndale) December 14, 2016   We asked Mr. Reevely four questions.  He answered all promptly, unlike all of our council which hadn’t responded as of publication time. CFN 1)   Your wrote “From 2011 to 2015, Cornwall’s population shrank by 5,000, or nearly 10 per cent. Four thousand more jobs disappeared.” How did you come up with that number?  Is that the Cornwall number or Eastern Ontario? REEVELY 1) The numbers are from Statistics Canada, based on the 2011 census and updated information from the Labour Force Survey. They’re Cornwall numbers but — importantly — they’re for the Cornwall “census agglomeration,” which includes South Stormont Township, not just the City of Cornwall. For anyone who doesn’t live in Cornwall, this is the area people think of as “Cornwall,” in the same way as the Montreal or Vancouver census areas include politically separate but obviously linked municipalities. CFN 2) Cornwall itself isn’t on Hydro One, but actually gets its power from Quebec.   We actually have some of the cheapest power in the province and we should be doing better economically because of that.  Would that info factor into your story? REEVELY 2) The point of the piece wasn’t to explore Cornwall’s economy in detail so I can’t speak to the specifics of hydro prices.   CFN 3) You touch on the losses for Cornwall, and your chart shows Eastern Ontario having he largest decline, but your story doesn’t give many specifics explaining those numbers.   Did your research show any factors or areas that could possibly lead to the negative results? REEVELY 3) I imagine Cornwall is affected by the same factors that affect lots of smaller centres: a combination of automation and cheaper imports have made it really hard for the factories and resource-processing businesses that were the mainstays of their economies to survive. We see it in the mass closures of sawmills and related industries like pulp and paper plants all over Ontario. We see it in the closure of the Hershey plant in Smiths Falls. We see it in the death of domestic textiles and clothing manufacturing. Bigger cities have done well in service industries and high-tech and culture production, but except for some pockets of advanced manufacturing like in the auto industry in southwestern Ontario, industry in rural areas has taken a beating. This is true throughout the advanced industrial economies. CFN 4)  Do you think you owe Councilor Towndale or Cornwall an apology for your story?  Do you think you erred at all? Finally, feel free to add a quote for publication summing up the reaction and your opinion. REEVELY 4) If I’d known how much the distinction between Cornwall-the-city and Cornwall-the-census-agglomeration would upset some people, I’d have made it clearer which I meant. Again, though, the piece wasn’t about Cornwall, and as written I think the worst thing you can reasonably say about it is it’s imprecise. But I used “Cornwall” the way Statistics Canada uses it.   This is incorrect @davidreevely @OttawaCitizen. Needs a #factcheck. Population has actually grown, jobs added. pic.twitter.com/zF66GTTuxy — Justin Towndale (@JTowndale) December 15, 2016 Again, when silly people do silly things like post images like that and then have Team Cornwall President go all Stepford wives as he was quoted in other media as stating: Chair of Team Cornwall Peter Gault ended the meeting by asking members of the community to help dispel rumours of a struggling Cornwall economy. Gault said stories of job losses in the community are in contrast to what Peters had shared with the audience. That silly quote is as goofy as Bob Kilger and Rick Shaver complaining about the Methodology of the Moneysense Entrepreneurial rankings which see a well deserved near bottom ranking for Cornwall yearly. It’s epic fail 101.   In this day and age we all compete to succeed and technology makes the World a smaller and faster place.  You can’t hide and just circle jerk your economy any longer with good results.   And of course it gives experienced journalists at the Citizen, and the few that might notice this silliness a giggle as they shake their heads and laugh at Cornwall, again. Mostly though it’s time to review why we simply don’t replace those that fail, like Bob Peter’s who clearly isn’t developing our Economy, with someone that might?     Giant Tiger just set up a distribution centre in Hydro One territory near Morrisburg.    Amazon just set up theirs in Quebec citing higher hydro rates in Ontario.   Yet Mr. Peters is on the home page of the Team Cornwall website and featured in its AGM.  If Mr. Peters is the best you have, or all you have, to pimp your best of year….well maybe it’s time to bring Gilles Latour back?  Think about that one for a moment….. How did Cornwall miss out on both of those distribution centers when that’s supposed to be one of our key growth sectors?  Did Mr. Peters even reach out to either company? When you have to raise water rates because you lose a factory doesn’t that truly echo what Mr. Reevely’s story was getting at, or was it simply Team Cornwall reacting to a single quote without reading a well written story?  When you’re looking at raising property taxes over 4% because your commercial real estate revenues drop is that economic growth? Could it simply be that a riding that keeps not voting with the sitting government, mixed with a backwards local economic business community, and no real cultural economy simply can’t keep up with the rest of the Province? Should we really be shooting the messengers or should we as a community take a sober look at what’s not working and come together to make the community grow?   Isn’t it time to stop celebrating failure? Or is this some feeble attempt to get some outside attention for Cornwall as the clique made a fuss over a Chez FM meme about our city recently as well?

The lawsuit filed by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), charged Wal-Mart with failing to accommodate Nancy Stack, a cancer survivor with physical limitations, and subjected her to harassment based on her disability. Stack worked at a Walmart store in Hodgkins, Ill. Wal-Mart’s alleged conduct violates the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), which prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability, which can include denying reasonable accommodations to employees with disabilities and subjecting them to a hostile work environment, the EEOC said. As a workplace accommodation, Stack needed a chair and a modified schedule. EEOC alleged that while the store provided Stack with a modified schedule for a period of time, it revoked the accommodation for no stated reason. Further, according to EEOC, the store did not ensure that a chair was in Stack’s work area, telling her that she had to haul a chair from the furniture department to her work area, a task that was difficult, given her disability. Making matters even worse, EEOC alleged that a co-worker harassed Stack by calling her “cripple” and “chemo brain.” EEOC filed suit in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division (Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.; Civil Action No. 15-cv-5796). Wal-Mart will pay $75,000 in monetary relief to Stack as part of a consent decree settling the suit. The two-year decree also provides additional, non-monetary relief intended to improve the Hodgkins store’s workplace. Under the decree, the store will train employees on disability discrimination and requests for reasonable accommodations under the ADA. The Walmart store will also monitor requests for accommodation and complaints of disability discrimination and report those to EEOC.

Advertisement A group opposed to Walmart’s expansion in Chico has filed a lawsuit challenging the City Council’s recent decision to greenlight the project. On Oct. 5, the Chico Planning Commission voted 5-2 to approve the nearly 64,500-square-foot expansion; a couple of weeks later, Brett Jolley, an attorney out of Stockton, filed an appeal on behalf of Chico Citizens for a Responsible Economy (CARE), which mounted a successful campaign against Walmart’s plans for a supercenter a decade ago. On Nov. 15, the council voted 4-3 to deny the appeal. On Thursday (Dec. 15), Jolley filed a petition for a writ of mandate, which “is necessary to remedy the city’s failure to address the project’s environmental impacts,” the document reads. The council met to discuss the litigation in closed session during its meeting on Tuesday (Dec. 20).

The surveillance footage, released by the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office on Wednesday, shows Michael Foster, 43, tackling Clarence Daniels from behind as he was walking into a Brandon, Fla. Wal-Mart on Tuesday. Foster followed Daniels into the store after seeing him exiting his vehicle with a gun holstered under his shirt — which was perfectly legal for the 62-year-old Daniels to do since he holds a concealed weapon license. Nevertheless, Foster tackled Daniels from behind as he entered the store, and put him in a chokehold before taking him to the ground. Witnesses said that Foster yelled out that Daniels had a gun. They also said that Daniels yelled out that he had a license for it. Foster called 911 only after he tackled accosted Daniels. He was arrested and charged with battery.
