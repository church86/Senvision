Wal-Mart is returning less cash to shareholders through its dividend this year. Adam Levy (adamlevy) Sep 3, 2016 at 2:21PM Image source: Wal-Mart. Through the first two quarters of fiscal 2017, Wal-Mart's (NYSE:WMT) total dividend payment to its shareholders declined about 0.8%. Barring any unexpected changes to the company's quarterly dividend payment, which it raised for the 43rd consecutive year in February, Wal-Mart will have its first-ever decline in total dividend payments. Wal-Mart has been supporting minor increases in its dividend per share rate through the use of share buybacks over the past few years. In each of the past three years, management has increased the dividend by just $0.01 per quarter, just about the bare minimum to keep its streak of annual dividend increases alive. With dividend growth slowing to a crawl, and now a decline in total dividend payment, should investors be worried about Wal-Mart's ability to continue increasing its payout? Let's take a look at some numbers to figure out where Wal-Mart's dividend stands. The payout ratio Dividends don't just magically appear in the middle of every quarter. Companies pay them out of their earnings. Whatever they don't pay out as a dividend is retained by the company for investment or a rainy day. What's leftover is aptly called retained earnings. A key way to determine the safety of a company's dividend is to see what percentage of earnings it currently pays out to shareholders. That's called its payout ratio. Importantly, investors ought to use forward-looking projections (management's forecast or analysts' estimates) to calculate payout ratios. Here's how Wal-Mart stacks up against some of its key competitors, Target (NYSE:TGT) and Costco (NASDAQ:COST). Company Dividend Earnings Forecast Payout Ratio Wal-Mart $2.00 $4.25 47% Target $2.40 $5.00 48% Costco $1.80 $5.95* 30% *Analyst consensus estimate for fiscal 2017 ending in August 2017. Data source: Company financial reports and Costco's investor relations page. Table source: Author. Wal-Mart's payout ratio is right in line with its biggest competitor, Target, but well above Costco's. Note, however, that Wal-Mart's dividend yield is 2.8% versus Costco's 1.1%, so it should be expected that it pays out a much higher portion of earnings. Target's yield, for reference, is 3.4%, notably better than Wal-Mart's despite similar payout ratios. But Wal-Mart has something going for it that Target doesn't: superior earnings stability. Earnings stability Earnings stability provides investors with a better idea of how reliable management's or analysts' outlooks are for the future. The less variability in earnings from year to year, the more likely the predictions are to prove accurate. It also means the future of the dividend is relatively safe provided the payout ratio isn't hovering above 100%. There are a couple factors I'll focus on with regard to earnings stability: revenue fluctuation and financial leverage. Revenue fluctuation is fairly clear cut: How much does revenue fluctuate from year to year? Wal-Mart's revenue is about as stable as it gets. Over the last five years, its total revenue grew about 10%. Over the last three years, the most Wal-Mart's revenue moved was up 1.77%. Target has seen larger revenue swings in each of the last four years. One of the biggest factors that makes Wal-Mart's revenue so stable is that it appeals to shoppers in both good and bad economic times. During a recession, more people will shop at Wal-Mart versus higher-priced retailers. During a period of economic growth, regular Wal-Mart shoppers may spend more. The other factor to consider is the business's financial leverage: how much debt the company holds as a percentage of its operating income. Businesses with a high amount of leverage will see an outsized impact on their bottom lines when revenue declines since interest expenses effectively add another fixed cost to the business. One way to evaluate a company's financial leverage is to look at its interest coverage. That is what percentage of operating profits goes toward paying interest expenses. Company Operating Profit (TTM) Interest Expense (TTM) Interest Coverage Wal-Mart $23.95 billion $2.31 billion 9.6% Target $4.99 billion $1.02 billion 20.4% Data source: Company financial reports, Yahoo! Finance Table source: Author Wal-Mart has significantly less financial leverage than Target, which means it's prone to less fluctuation in net earnings from changes in its operating profit. Coupled with its comparably more stable revenue, Wal-Mart's earnings projections are likely more accurate than Target's. That's also evidenced by the narrower range Wal-Mart provided ($4.15 to $4.35) compared to Target ($4.80 to $5.20). One final factor The last factor to consider is management's stance toward the dividend. Wal-Mart has been paying a dividend since 1974, and it's raised that dividend every year. But the slowing dividend payment indicates that management is starting to lean toward investing more of its earnings back into the company. Specifically, management has been investing heavily to grow its e-commerce business. It expects to spend $900 million on its e-commerce operations this year, and another $1.1 billion next year, up from $700 million last year. What's more, it just spent another $300 million in cash and $3 billion in stock to acquire Jet.com. Considering Wal-Mart's decline in online sales growth over the previous few years, the investment in e-commerce is necessary to take back market share in one of the fastest-growing retail avenues. The investments have already started paying off with digital sales revenue accelerating last quarter, and that's before the Jet.com acquisition. Management may decide to return its focus to the dividend after it secures its position in e-commerce. In the meantime, they should expect management to continue with the minimum to keep its name on the list of Dividend Aristocrats. So, despite the decline in total dividend payments, it doesn't seem like the dividend is in any doubt. That's not to say there aren't better options for investors looking to invest in the retail space. Adam Levy has no position in any stocks mentioned.

A study out of Columbia University suggests that Walmart deliberately runs much better stores in white neighborhoods than in minority neighborhoods. The study found that stores in lower-income neighborhoods have considerably lower customer service ratings than those in wealthier ones. More specifically, the higher the percentage of black or Latino residents in an area, the lower the Walmart rating, reports Consumerist. The researchers suggest one reason is that the chain generally doesn't staff stores in low-income neighborhoods adequately because it doesn't need to do so—Walmarts in such neighborhoods are often the only place people can shop, and thus competition and customer satisfaction aren't priorities. “When Walmart moves into the South Side of Chicago, it’s not really displacing numerous other businesses,” study author Adam Reich tells the Atlantic. “So it can shortchange investments in staff, and force people to work harder. Consumers don’t have a choice about where they’re shopping.” The authors, who published their study in the American Sociological Association journal Contexts, analyzed Yelp reviews of 2,840 stores and found that those in predominantly black areas tend to be rated with words like "nasty," "terrible," and "unorganized," while those in white areas tend to be described as "friendly," "clean," and "pleasant." A Walmart spokesperson tells Business Insider that the analysis is both "flawed" and "without merit," and the publication notes a few "holes," including that reviewer bias and outside influence can't be accounted for. (More than 200 violent crimes have been reported at Walmarts so far this year.)   My Take on This Story Report a story error Show results without voting  |   21% Hilarious 12% Intriguing 12% Depressing 14% Brilliant 2% Scary 40% Ridiculous Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Email Story 173 comments Next on Newser: After All That, Zika Was a No-Show at the Olympics Comments Read comment policy Showing 3 of 173 comments ME123 Sep 6, 2016 11:25 AM CDT Not that I want to defend Walmart, but what exactly suggests the lower quality of service/store cleanliness/etc. is deliberate on the part of Walmart, and not just a result of lower quality employees? I went to a Walmart once in a pretty rundown area of town. There was a spill on the floor in one of the aisles. I found two employees talking a few aisles away and told them about it. They just looked at me and went back to talking. I don't think Walmart is telling their employees, "This is a poor neighborhood, so don't worry about being nice to people, or keeping the store clean." I think it's a result of the employees themselves just not being quality employees, unfortunately because the pool of people available to hire from in poorer neighborhoods may not be as good (no, I'm not suggesting poor people are lazy or whatnot. What I am saying is that the reality is, in bad neighborhoods, more people than not just have no pride in what they do, or concern for other people). As for what they stock? That's true in every single store. The stock is going to depend on the demand of the area it's in. no what i mean vern? Sep 5, 2016 10:27 AM CDT Hardly surprising that stores nestled in the heart of dysfunctional, multi-generational welfare recipients are doing poorly. When entering these stores, I quickly make note of the nearest exits as a flash mob might break out at any moment. That, along with the ever popular ¨knock out game¨ might have something to do with the poor store quality. But we must not mention that, right? MariCee Sep 5, 2016 6:45 AM CDT No surprise here.

Employees will be offered employment elsewhere in the stores although many of these jobs will pay less. The intention of Walmart to slash 7,000 jobs was first reported Wednesday in the Wall Street Journal. The jobs to be cut will be accounting and invoicing jobs in the offices of individual stores and these jobs will become automated. Machines will be used to count money and invoicing will be done at the company's central location in Arkansas. The employees who lose their jobs will not be let go but rather offered other jobs that will be customer-related. CEO Douglas McMillion said the company wants to focus on better customer service by increasing the number of employees who work on the floor and have direct contact with customers. While some of the new jobs offered to these employees may be higher-paid positions such as assistant managers, others may pay less that the workers' current jobs. Many of those who work in Walmart offices are long time employees who earn more than those who work on the floor in sales and stocking shelves. Walmart intends to implement the automation of their stores in the coming months and the changeover is not expected to be completed until 2017. A pilot project involving cuts to office jobs in 500 stores in the Western United States has been completed. The company was pleased with the transition although their spokesperson could not say how many employees were transferred to other positions and how many left the company. Walmart could also not say how many of the transferred employees ended up in lower-paying positions. Some new positions were with the company's online food sales. "Making Change at Walmart," a group that fights for the rights of Walmart employees, is sceptical that any employees will be better off. Jess Levin, the group's communications director, said most likely these 7,000 employees will be given the choice of a lower paying job or no job at all. Walmart is making these changes because the company is facing stiff competition from online sales from companies such as Amazon. Job cuts have already been made and some stores have closed. As part of the changes being undertaken, wages have been increased in an attempt to increase employee morale. As Yahoo News reports replacing jobs with automation is nothing new and is not restricted to Walmart. The major retailer's announcement is part of what is referred to as the "Fourth Industrial Revolution." It has been estimated that by 2020, about five million workers will be replaced by robots. Walmart, the largest private employer in the United States, currently employees about 1.5 million people nationwide.

It’s online shopping. The giant retailer plans to plunk down a princely $3.3 billion for Jet.com, an e-commerce company. Using the same crystal ball, Macy’s says it will close at least 100 stores, many in malls that have seen better days. Where does retailing in our city centers and on our Main Streets fit into this story? The answers are not simple. In the beginning, Americans went downtown to buy everything from hammers to sweaters to footballs. When much of the middle class departed for the suburbs, the retailers followed them. The new shopping venues were big-chain discounters and giant malls. This mass transfer drained the life out of downtown retailing, leaving sad, empty storefronts on architecturally splendid streets. Nowadays, “the Darwinian thing is going on in suburban retailing that was happening downtown,” Mark Cohen, retailing expert at Columbia Business School, told me. Amazon.com is the undisputed king of that jungle. Its online megastore sells 550 million products. Every year, it takes a bigger bite out of bricks-and-mortar store sales. Another weight on suburban retailing is a ludicrous overbuilding of retail space. “The developers never saw a highway and exit ramp that they didn’t want to build a mall on,” Cohen quipped. So what happens next? Many of the fringe developments further down the highway without full tenancy are going to be history, according to retail analysts. Some big boxes, such as Home Depot and Lowe’s, may do OK. Others will not. On to our downtowns. Whether hopping with activity, on the mend or still ailing, they remain the center for much of our civic life. Downtown is where one finds city or town hall, a main post office, a good library and transportation hubs. The stores are key players in the experience. Will online shopping hurt Main Street retailing the way it has plagued suburban stores? That all depends on the downtown. Where there is gentrification – wealthier people moving to urban neighborhoods – there is, of course, retail opportunity. Another advantage for city and town shopping districts is foot traffic, people walking by storefronts. Take me. I’m one of Amazon Prime’s valued customers. I click away for moth traps and patio lights and color printers that get delivered to my doorstep. I know exactly what a Lego Elves toy is and would not sacrifice a half-hour driving for something I can order online in five minutes. But shopping does remain a part of the entertainment mix. On Saturday afternoons, folks hang out in nearby shopping districts. The stores there display clothes and housewares more interesting than the commodities at the discounters’. And being seduced by an artful display window could be a byproduct of meeting someone two doors down for coffee. Many of the most successful retail districts are those that attract tourists, particularly foreign ones. Visiting Asians, Russians and South Americans are known to stuff empty suitcases with stuff bought here. The concern right now is the higher American dollar – plus the threat of another travel-related terrorist attack. The good news for physical retailers everywhere, Cohen said, is that the internet isn’t likely to take it all. About 15 percent of current retail sales, online shopping could possibly go as high as 40 percent, but that would still leave at least 60 percent. And so the dreamscape of a bustling Main Street persists. Every now and then, one comes across a surviving family-run sporting goods or shoe store – and salutes. It would be awfully nice to see more of them. Froma Harrop is a columnist for Creators Syndicate.

The jobs are primarily centered around invoicing and accounting, not customer facing roles. So, instead of having employees work out of offices at stores around the country, Walmart says those tasks will be handled at a central office or by machines. Cutting jobs usually isn’t seen as a great sign for businesses. But in this case, Walmart says that it wants to focus more on customer facing positions. The company has recently focused on making more employees available to actually interact with customers in stores. And at a recent shareholder meeting, the company claimed that customer satisfaction has risen for the last 79 weeks in a row. So it’s possible that those efforts are paying off. Will cutting invoicing and office jobs help Walmart continue to improve customer satisfaction? It’s likely too early to say. Certainly, for many small businesses, the key to success is to automate or outsource as many back office or support functions as possible to stay focused on dealing with customers and actually creating better customer experience. The Key Point in this Core Competencies Example? Obviously focusing on core competencies (what your business does best) is the best way to grow a business. And it looks like Walmart may have figured this out too. So in this instance perhaps one off the world’s biggest retailers is actually taking a play from the small business handbook.

Now through Oct. 9, Walmart and Sam’s Club customers at 25 locations across Northeast Ohio can make a $1, $2 or $5 donation at the register when completing a purchase. For a $5 donation, customers will receive a reusable, insulated, zippered tote featuring the Akron Children’s and CMN logos, while supplies last. Last year, Walmart raised $260,000 for Akron Children’s through its CMN Hospitals register campaign. Since 1987, Walmart has raised $870 million nationally for CMN Hospitals. FDA bans antiseptic chemicals from soaps WASHINGTON The federal government Friday banned more than a dozen chemicals long-used in antibacterial soaps, saying manufacturers failed to show they are safe and kill germs. “We have no scientific evidence that they are any better than plain soap and water,” said Dr. Janet Woodcock, the Food and Drug Administration’s drug center director, in a statement. Friday’s decision primarily targets two once-ubiquitous ingredients – triclosan and triclocarban – that some limited research in animals suggests can interfere with hormone levels and spur drug-resistant bacteria. Man charged with threatening new Sandy Hook School NEWTOWN, Conn. A Connecticut man is accused of phoning in a threat to the new Sandy Hook Elementary School, which replaced the building that was demolished after 20 children and six educators were shot to death there in 2012. Newtown police arrested 28-year-old Pierre Beauvil, of Stamford, on Friday on threatening, harassment and breach of peace charges. Police say someone called the school’s main office a couple of weeks ago and asked when the first day of school was. After he was told it was Aug. 29, he made a threat against the school for that day. Newtown police say they and other area police departments are investigating whether Beauvil threatened other schools. Transgender restroom trial delayed in NC RALEIGH, N.C. The trial over a North Carolina law restricting restroom access for transgender people is being pushed back by several months, attorneys challenging the law said Friday. U.S. Magistrate Judge Joi Elizabeth Peake granted a request from the state’s Republican leaders to delay the North Carolina trial while the U.S. Supreme Court considers whether to hear a Virginia case on transgender restroom access, according to a brief entry in the federal court docket.

(WISH) — More cell phone video of Wal-Mart in Beech Grove surfaced, but this video is in stark contrast to the brawl in the shampoo aisle that went viral more than a year ago. The most recent video captures a special re-opening ceremony. People gathered to pray for Wal-Mart and the city. The store was recently remodeled, and city officials hope it rids the shopping center of its tainted reputation. When people in Beech Grove think Wal-Mart, the thoughts aren’t often positive. “That fight. That’s the first thing that comes to mind, was that fight between them two women in there,” said Shawn Atherton, who lives in Beech Grove. It’s hard to separate the Beech Grove Wal-Mart from the brawl, in which two women are seen fighting in the shampoo aisle. One had her young son and encouraged him to join. It was the fight heard round the world a little more than a year ago. Fast forward to Friday morning. A group of people made up of employees, shoppers and city leaders gathered around while a preacher prayed inside the store. Beech Grove Mayor Dennis Buckley was there. “It was very nice. I really liked it. He prayed about the past,” Buckley said. The prayer was symbolic of a new beginning for the store and the city. “There was a time when Wal-Mart really wasn’t good for us. I had no problem sitting at the table and telling Wal-Mart executives that,” Buckley explained. Since the fight, Wal-Mart hired its own security for the store and put up fencing around the property. Buckley says theft runs for the police department have gone down 30 percent. “The majority of that was due to shoplifting at Wal-Mart. So, they’ve done a nice job of identifying their problem and working with us to correct the problem,” he said. “I hope it is,” Atherton added, “I hope a lot of people go in there. Maybe I’ll try going in there one day.” Police say another reason theft runs are down is because Wal-Mart is handling many of the cases within the store and they’re not being reported. Buckley says he plans to meet with Wal-Mart next week. 24-Hour News 8 reached out to Wal-Mart for a comment. We did not hear back..

The cuts will affect back-office tasks such as accounting and invoicing. As The Wall Street Journal notes, these positions are most often held by employees that have been with the company for many years and are among the highest paid hourly workers in stores. Walmart, however, wants these veteran employees to be working directly with shoppers, not hidden away in backrooms. Starting early next year, the mega retailer will be replacing the tasks that back-office employees do with new money-counting “cash recycler” machines and relocating other tasks to a central office. Walmart spokesperson Deisha Barnett said they tested the change in roughly 500 stores earlier this year. Barnett added that they believe most displaced employees will find new customer-facing roles and that their salaries could go up or down depending on their new position. Although it is replacing some jobs with automation, industry-wide changes are creating several new positions that didn’t exist just a few years ago. For example, Walmart is expanding a new service that lets customers order their groceries online and pick them up curbside. The retailer needs dedicated employees to fill the orders and deliver them to the customer’s vehicle when they arrive. Another program uses Uber and Lyft drivers to deliver groceries directly to a customer's home. Not everyone, however, is excited about the change. One employee that has been with Walmart for more than 20 years making $15 an hour doing invoicing said they are getting their resume together because a move back to the store floor isn’t appealing.

If you're new to the site, you may want to subscribe to the the feed. VS. With the massive number of prepaid MVNOs and carrier options, it’s sometimes hard to keep track of it all and even harder to compare and decide which company is the right one for you. So, every once in a while we’re going to go through and do a Face-off of two popular companies; comparing plans and services to help you better decide. Today, we’ll look at two T-Mobile MVNOs: GoSmart Mobile and Walmart Family Mobile. The two compare pretty closely, as they both run on the same network and have similar pricing. Walmart Family Mobile has quicker data speeds than GoSmart mobile, though, making that the clear front runner for those of us who need speedy internet. Here’s how they compare: Plan Prices – Price range? What is included? GoSmart Mobile  – Plans range from $25 – $55 GoSmart Mobile offers four plans. All of the plans include unlimited talk and text, and aside from the $25 plan, all plans include unlimited web at 3G speeds. The real perk is for avid Facebook users, since all four plans offered include unlimited 4G LTE Facebook access. Check out GoSmart Mobile plans here. Walmart Family Mobile  – Plans range from $25 – $50 Walmart Family Mobile also offers four plans, all of which include unlimited talk and text. While the basic plan lacks data, 4G LTE is added with a price increase. You can find Walmart Family Mobile plans here. Unlimited Talk/Text – Is it offered? What is the lowest price? GoSmart Mobile – Yes, the basic $25 plan consists of unlimited talk and text with no data. Walmart Family Mobile  – Yes, $25 will get you unlimited talk and text here too. Data Ranges – What is the most and least data available? GoSmart Mobile – Currently, all of the data with GoSmart will be at 3G speeds unless you are browsing Facebook. With that being said, the $35 plan offers 4GB a month and the most expensive plan offers up to 20GB of data. Walmart Family Mobile  – All of the plans, after the basic $25 one, include unlimited data. Only a portion of it would include the 4G LTE though. With the $30 plan, you are allotted 1GB of high speed data and it would increase all the way to 10GB with the most expensive $50 plan. Pay-As-You-Go Rates – What are the pay-as-you-go per minute rates? GoSmart Mobile – N/A – no pay as you go options available. Walmart Family Mobile  – N/A – no pay as you go options available. International Calling – What options are available? What does it cost? GoSmart Mobile – While GoSmart mobile does include unlimited international texting with its plans, unlimited international calling is available for purchase for $10. Walmart Family Mobile – Walmart Family mobile does not offer an option for unlimited international minutes, but you can see a list of rates by country here. Activation Fees – How much do they cost? GoSmart Mobile – No activation fee. Walmart Family Mobile – You must purchase a starter kit prior to activation, and these start at $25. You can do that in a Walmart store or on the website. BYOD – Can you activate your own device? GoSmart Mobile – Yes; Most unlocked GSM phones will work. You can double check a device here. Walmart Family Mobile – Yes, as long as it’s GSM and unlocked.

(Walmart.com screenshot) Print Email Connor Sheets | csheets@al.com By Connor Sheets | csheets@al.com The Birmingham News Email the author | Follow on Twitter on September 02, 2016 at 12:11 PM comments There is officially a pair of sneakers selling for $6,499 on Walmart's website. The shoes on offer are a couple of Kanye West's famed Nike Air Yeezy 2s in red, and they are going for the price of a pretty solid used car. Walmart itself did not set the price, as the size 8.5 footwear was posted on the site by a reseller called Sole-Unlimited LLC. The shoes are listed in the sale description as "Nike Mens Air Yeezy 2 SP 'Red October' Red 508214-660," and identified as "Brand New in Original Box. Comes with all accessories associated with the release. Original Receipt will be included." And, according to the site, there's "[o]nly one left!" The shocking sticker price on the shoes - which were designed as a collaboration between Nike and Kanye West (nickname Yeezy) - led the listing to become a trending topic on Facebook Friday afternoon, drawing a wide range of user comments. The shoes may never sell, given the sky-high price. Or maybe some deep-pocketed shopper will buy them as a gag. But the reviews they drew on the Walmart.com listing are hilarious enough that the whole experiment won't have been for naught. "I use my Yeezy's to nurture two of my most prized precious succulent plants -- Julian, and DayStar," one reviewer wrote. "Since I planted Julian and DayStar into their new homes I've watched them hit a new growth spurt. The nutrients in the Air Yeezy's have brought new life to my plants." Another user, dubbed YEEZY 2020 - apparently a reference to calls for West to run for president in four years - wrote that "I know Ye went to Adidas. But these joints were the greatest shoes of ALL TIME." No matter how great the kicks may be, it seems unlikely that the typical sneakerhead would be willing to shell out several thousands of dollars for a pair of shoes that only came out less than three years ago and originally retailed for just $250.

Jeremy Bowman (TMFHobo) Sep 2, 2016 at 9:28AM For years, Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) and Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) have been the two leading American retailers, posting more revenue than any of their rivals. That streak looks set to end this year as Amazon.com passes Costco, but nonetheless, the two companies reign supreme in the brick-and-mortar world. The companies have a great deal in common. They both rose to prominence thanks to their low-price leadership. Wal-Mart has done this through its everyday low prices strategy, while Costco's bare-bones warehouses help it deliver rock-bottom prices on bulk goods. Wal-Mart even has its own Costco-like chain, Sam's Club, which generates about 12% of the company's total revenue. Both Wal-Mart and Costco have an international presence, but still make the bulk of their revenue and profits from the U.S. Still, there are important differences between the two. Costco tends to cater to a more upscale customer than Wal-Mart due to its $55 annual membership fee, while Wal-Mart attracts a lower and middle-income clientele. Because of that, Costco's stores are generally found in and around major cities, and about one third of its locations in the U.S. are in California. Wal-Mart, on the other hand, is most common in the South, and tends to favor rural locations. The company likes to point out that 70% of Americans live within five miles of a Wal-Mart store. Today, as part of our better-buy series, we'll take an in-depth look at each company to determine which is the better stock for investors today.   Image Source: Wal-Mart. Trouble in Wally World While Wal-Mart is far and away the global retail leader and has more revenue than any other company in the world, the superstore chain finds itself threatened today like never before.  For the first time in at least 45 years, Wal-Mart reported a decline in revenue last year. Competition from Amazon and e-commerce has upset the traditional retail model, forcing Wal-Mart to rethink the way it does business. New CEO Doug McMillon has made some uncharacteristic moves, including raising base wages to $10/hour and making investments to clean up stores, bring back greeters, and ensure that products are in stock. The company has also stepped up investment in its e-commerce platform, and has scaled back on opening new stores. It's rapidly expanded its grocery pick-up service, which allows customers to order online and pick up perishables and other foodstuffs from a parking lot kiosk, and just spent $3.3 billion on e-commerce upstart Jet.com, a bet on that company's pricing technology and the brains of its founder Marc Lore, who sold his previous company, Quidsi, to Amazon. 2016 is a transitional year for the retail giant, but there are signs that McMillon's strategy is paying off. Same-store sales at U.S. stores grew by 1.6% in its most recent quarter, the fastest clip in several years, and e-commerce growth accelerated for the first time in two years. Last October, management outlined its turnaround plan, promising that this year would be its biggest investment year with EPS falling 6% to 12%, but that EPS would grow 5-10% in fiscal 2019 (calendar year 2018). Though it's still early in the transition, Wal-Mart appears to be on track to return to profitable growth. Image Source: Motley Fool.  Costco's also feeling the heat Though Costco stock has outperformed Wal-Mart's in recent years, the warehouse retailer finds itself in a similar predicament as the rise of e-commerce threatens to take customers away from the warehouse giant. Costco has an e-commerce presence, but management has been reluctant to embrace the platform as it would rather drive traffic to its cavernous stores, where customers can make impulse purchases and buy bulk goods that are difficult to ship.   Earnings per share have actually fallen through the first three quarters of the year due to lower gas prices and foreign currency exchange, and the company's underlying comparable sales growth has also slowed. Last quarter it was 3% in the U.S. and globally, and its fourth quarter is on a similar pace based on the company's monthly reports. That clip may be decent for most retailers in today's environment, but Costco's comparable sales had been increasing in the mid-to-high single digits for several years, and the recent results could be a sign of a longer-term, secular slowdown. Membership fees, the source of most of the company's profits, have continued to increase at a modest pace, up 5.8% in the most recent quarter and 3.8% for the year thus far, though those figures don't account for currency fluctuations. At a P/E of 31, Costco's valuation is also double that of Wal-Mart's, indicating higher expectations from investors.  And the better buy is... Investors' preference between Costco and Wal-Mart may come down to investing style. Value investors and dividend hunters are likely to prefer Wal-Mart, which trades at half the valuation of Costco and offers a dividend yield of 2.8% compared to just 1.1% for Costco. Growth-minded investors, on the other hand, may prefer the warehouse retailer, which despite its recent headwinds is still delivering respectable comparable sales growth and has a membership renewal rate of around 90%, indicating high customer satisfaction. As gas prices and currency even out, profit growth should return for Costco.  Both companies appear to be challenged by the rise of e-commerce, but, on balance, I'd say the better buy of the two is Costco. Its membership base provides a consistent source of profits, and the company has a long track record of growth. Though its high P/E ratio could leave room for multiple compression if profit growth slows, I'd still expect it to outperform Wal-Mart over the coming years.

A combined VHS-DVD player produced by Funai Electronics of Japan. The company announced that it would cease production of VHS players at the end of July, 2016. Funai is the last producer of the one-popular machines. (Photo: Funai Electronics) If your most cherished family memories are stored away on old VHS tapes, you need to act now. As time passes, videotapes lose their magnetic signal. The sharpness, quality and color deteriorate. Worst of all, the tape grows brittle and breaks as it’s played. To preserve the content of your videotapes, digitizing them is a must. Here are three services that make it simple to modernize your old video collection. 1. Costco Costco offers a digital transfer service through its Photo Center. You can transfer several types of videotapes to DVDs including VHS and S-VHS, Beta, VHS-C, Hi8, Digital 8, 8mm and MiniDV. The service includes two personalized DVDs with intelligent chapters, personalized themes and custom music. Each transfer begins at $19.99 and each DVD can hold up to two hours of video. If the footage on your tape exceeds the two-hour limit, the content will be split onto two DVDs and you'll be charged as if you'd placed two separate orders. You can place your order using Costco's website and drop off your tapes at your local store. When your DVDs are ready, simply pick them up and take them back home to enjoy. Just make sure the footage you provide them is not copyrighted material. Every transfer you make also comes with your own private online account at no extra cost as long as you remain an active user. This online account lets you view your transferred videos from any computer or device.  To keep your account active, you must view or share videos at least once per year. Costco's digital transfer service is not limited to videotapes. You can also transfer film reels, 35mm slides, photo prints and memory cards to DVDs. Click here to learn more about Costco Photo Center's services. 2. Walgreens Walgreens is another retail location that offers a digital transfer service. With Walgreens Photo, you can transfer videotapes, movie films, HD videos and photographs onto DVDs. The pricing for Walgreen's service is complex. DVDs cost $24.99 per videotape, plus an additional $9.99 for the DVD itself. If you'd prefer to have the final footage in Blu-ray format, the cost is $20. Movie films cost $19.99 for 50 feet of film, plus $9.99 per DVD and are only accepted in 8mm, Super 8 and 16mm formats. Walgreens also offers cloud storage for a monthly fee of $4.99. This service allows you to share or watch your films with anyone, anywhere, at any time. If you're on the fence about whether or not the cloud is worth it, your first order includes a one-month free trial. Click here to learn more about Walgreen's Photo. 3. Walmart Walmart also offers a DVD transfer service. Videotapes, movie film, photographs and slides, and digital media can all be transferred to DVD. Like Costco, Walmart places a two-hour limit per DVD. The cost is $24.96 to transfer one VHS tape, which makes it the more expensive option. However, transferring movie film is cheaper at Walmart than it is at Walgreens. The first 100 feet of film costs $24.96, and you'll be charged $.20 per foot thereafter. Additional DVDs cost under $9.96 and additional Blu-rays cost $13.96. If you're still not ready to part with your old VHS tapes, Walmart also offers a special service to repair any that are damaged. This service costs $19.96. Click here to compare Walmart's transfer services.  Bonus: The DIY Way If handing over your private tapes makes you nervous, transfer them to DVD yourself. To do this, you'll need a DVD Recorder and VCR Combo. This device features 1080p up-conversion and 2-way dubbing. This way, you are able to transfer from VHS tapes to DVDs and vice versa. Another advantage to this method is that it can record up to six hours of footage. It's also equipped with an HDMI output. The advantage to purchasing your own DVD Recorder and VCR Combo is that it’s actually the cheapest option if you need to transfer your entire VHS library. You can also share it with friends and family members. It’s easier to use than you might think. Just power the recorder on, insert your VHS tape into the VCR slot and insert a blank DVD-R into the DVD tray. Press “record” and your footage will begin transferring. When the transfer is complete, press “play” on the DVD player to confirm everything was transferred properly. Once you’ve brought your video library into the 21st century, don’t stop there.

The job relocation will come from its invoice and accounting departments in all its 4,600 U.S. stores, and most of the affected employees will find new customer-facing jobs, Walmart said, adding that the new jobs will include positions like working in the online pickup department or as pharmacy technicians. Walmart spokeswoman Deisha Barnett said that the company is anticipating that associates move into new roles rather than leave the company. As for the wage levels for the relocated employees, Barnett said it would depend on what new positions the employees obtain. Walmart has been hit hard by competition from online shopping sites, particularly Amazon, and the retailer has announced store closures and job cuts several times over the past year. In June this year, Walmart already cut some back office jobs at 500 stores in what Barnett called a "pilot program" to test out the transition process. To make its stores more efficient, Walmart is spending billions of dollars to boost its e-commerce sales while reducing inventory and raising wages. Founded in 1962, Walmart employs about 2.2 million workers worldwide and has 11,539 stores and clubs in 28 countries and regions.

Sales are still sluggish at the handbag maker. The company is trying to breathe new life into its brand by offering different materials like leather and microfibers as well as opening a store in Soho, New York.

(AP/Jae C. Hong) Share Written by Oliver Staley Obsession The Office September 02, 2016 Add retail accounting jobs to the list of occupations under threat from machines. Walmart is eliminating about 7,000 back-office positions at its stores, with the jobs either being centralized or automated, The Wall Street Journal reported (paywall). The employees, among the highest paid in its stores, tally the day’s receipts or manage invoices from suppliers. The desk jobs are highly sought after because workers didn’t have to be on their feet in the stores; now, many of those employees will be asked to go back out to the sales floor as associates to help customers. The company tested the changes in about 500 US stores and plans to roll them out to all 4,600 over the next few months. While the position is a tiny fraction of the company’s 1.2 million US jobs, their loss is a blow to Walmart employees hoping to make a career at the retailing goliath and eager to advance beyond the meager pay of associates. Back office workers are paid as much as $15 an hour, still a pittance but better than the $9 an hour starting pay. Charles Crowson, a Walmart spokesman, said there are still opportunities for advancement. “Upward mobility is always a possibility at Walmart,” Crowson told Quartz. The move toward increased automation should send shivers down the spines of office workers everywhere. There are 21 million Americans in clerical jobs, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and a great many of those positions are vulnerable to automation of some kind. Bank tellers have been replaced by ATMs, and travel agents have disappeared as passengers book online. Robots are writing sports and business articles, while drones and automated driving may soon threaten trucking. In a 2013 paper, two Oxford professors considered 702 different occupations and used an algorithm to rank them by how susceptible they were to automation. They concluded that 47% of total US employment was at risk. Among the most endangered positions were clerks of all sorts, as well as occupations as diverse as loan officers and watch repairers. Safe occupations included highly skilled professions like doctors, or ones that demand human interaction, like teachers. Sales positions were also ranked as relatively safe, which may come as small comfort to the former Walmart clerks back on the shop floor.

The nation’s largest private employer said Thursday that the cuts will take place in all its namesake stores, confirming the move reported by The Wall Street Journal. The goal is to get workers out of the backrooms and onto the selling floors as Wal-Mart faces increasing competition from online leader Amazon.com. Wal-Mart said it believes most of the displaced workers will find new jobs that involve direct contact with shoppers and that the change was not a downsizing move. The customer-facing jobs would include positions such as working in the online pickup department or as pharmacy technicians. US factory activity shrinks for first time in 6 months WASHINGTON U.S. manufacturing contracted last month for the first time since February, as new orders and output plummeted and factories cut jobs. The Institute for Supply Management said Thursday that its manufacturing index dropped to 49.4 in August from 52.6 in July. Any reading below 50 signals contraction. The report suggests that manufacturers continue to struggle as businesses spend less on machinery, computers and other large equipment. Auto sales also have leveled off this year after reaching a record level in 2015. Still, the magnitude of the decline surprised many economists, since other recent measures of factory output, including surveys of manufacturers in the Philadephia region, improved this month. US average 30-year mortgage rate rises to 3.46 percent WASHINGTON Long-term U.S. mortgage rates rose this week amid expectations in financial markets that an increase in interest rates by the Federal Reserve may be on the horizon. Mortgage rates remain at historically low levels, however. Mortgage giant Freddie Mac said Thursday the average for the benchmark 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 3.46 percent, up from 3.43 percent last week. The average rate is down from 3.89 percent a year ago, and is close to its all-time low of 3.31 percent in November 2012. Stocks stage late recovery to finish mostly higher NEW YORK U.S. stocks staged a late recovery Thursday and finished mostly higher, led by technology and metals companies. However, energy companies continued to fall with the price of oil. In early trading, the Dow Jones industrial average lost as much as 105 points.

The nation’s largest private employer said Thursday that the cuts will take place in all its namesake stores, confirming the move reported by The Wall Street Journal. The goal is to get workers out of the backrooms and onto the selling floors as Wal-Mart faces increasing competition from online leader Amazon.com. Wal-Mart said it believes most of the displaced workers will find new jobs that involve direct contact with shoppers and that the change was not a downsizing move. The customer-facing jobs would include positions like working in the online pickup department or as pharmacy technicians. U.S. Productivity Down in Spring, While Labor Costs Rise WASHINGTON (AP) – U.S. productivity fell in Q2 by a larger amount than first estimated, while labor costs accelerated sharply. Productivity declined at an annual rate of 0.6 percent, even worse than the 0.5 percent drop initially reported, the Labor Department reported Thursday. It marked the third straight quarter that productivity has fallen. Labor costs rose at an annual rate of 4.3 percent, the biggest rise since a 5.7 percent increase in the fourth quarter. Labor costs had fallen at a 0.3 percent rate in the first quarter. U.S. Construction Spending Unchanged In July WASHINGTON (AP) – U.S. construction spending was unchanged in July as weakness in spending on government projects offset gains in home building and the strongest month for non-residential construction on record. Spending in June is now reported up 0.9 percent while May showed an increase of 0.1 percent. Office building and shopping centers both showed solid gains.

Story and photos by Staff Sgt. Taresha Hill 8th Military Police Brigade Public Affairs 8th Theater Sustainment Command WAIPAHU — U.S. Army military police officers from various units throughout the 728th Military Police Battalion, 8th MP Brigade, 8th Theater Sustainment Command, participated in Special Olympics Hawaii’s Cop on Top, Aug. 25-27, at the Waipahu Walmart. Each year Special Olympics Hawaii hosts a variety of fundraisers to help support its athletes while raising awareness and Cop on Top is one such fundraiser. Modest beginnings Over 10 years ago, Cop on Top began with the determination of one police officer who stayed on top of the Waikiki Theater in the hopes of making $10,000.  After only four hours on top of the theater, the lone police officer accomplished his goal, and his feat sparked the Cop on Top idea. In 2016, volunteer police officers stand atop a scaffold out front of various Walmart locations, and with their megaphones and music thumping in the background, enthusiastically reach out to shoppers below to donate. U.S. Army military police officers Sgt. 1st Class Sean Lamanteer (left), 13th MP Det., and Spc. Jacob Doughty (right), 58th MP Company, 728th MP Bn., stand atop a scaffold out front of the Waipahu Walmart, during Special Olympics Hawaii’s annual Cop on Top fund-raising campaign. Making a pitch Spc. Jacob Doughty, military police officer, 58th MP Company, was one such volunteer who shouted from atop the scaffold, encouraging shoppers to give what they could. “Every little bit helps!” Fellow military police officer Spc. Trevin Correia, 13th MP Detachment, said she was more than happy to come out and support Special Olympics Hawaii and to show the community a different side of military police. “Being a police officer means helping the community,” said Correia. “I also have a sister who is autistic, so I love helping out with stuff like this.” Every year Special Olympics Hawaii’s Cop on Top campaign has a goal of $15,000 it wants each site to raise for athletes. Antonio Williams, chief of police, Directorate of Emergency Services, U.S. Army Garrison-Hawaii, and lead officer in charge of the event, said he hopes to reach that goal this year for his location. “Last year we fell short,” said Williams. “This year is looking good.” As the three-day event came to a close, the donations were tallied up. Williams said he was happy to report that the $15,000 goal was reached and expressed his gratitude for the volunteers. “Without a doubt, we could not do this without the support of the brigade,” he said. Antonio Williams (right), chief of police, DES, USAGHI, and lead officer in charge of the event, accepts a donation on behalf of Special Olympics Hawaii’s annual Cop on Top fund-raising campaign held Aug. 25-27, at the Waipahu Walmart. Special Olympics Hawaii According to its website’s mission statement, Special Olympics Hawaii provides year-round sports training and athletic competition in a variety of Olympic-type sports for children and adults with intellectual disabilities, giving them continuing opportunities. The nonprofit is able to fund and support these events through events like Cop on Top, the annual Troy Barboza Torch Run and Tip A Cop. Volunteers are needed for the upcoming Oahu Regional Unified Bowling Tournament held at Schofield Barracks Bowing Alley, Oct. 22. To volunteer for the event, email okg003@msn.com.

Superman: Dawn of Justice Batcave is one of Walmart's top 25 toy picks for the upcoming holiday season. (Photo courtesy of Walmart) Posted: Sept. 02, 2016 0 Comments SHARE The Disney Princess Carriage is expected to be among the big sellers at Walmart this holiday season. (Photo by Ron Batzdorff) By Charisse Jones, USA TODAY NETWORK Posted: Sept. 02, 2016 0 A racing play set, a Disney princess carriage and a drone are among Walmart's top toy picks for the upcoming holiday shopping season. The world's largest retailer, relying on the recommendations of hundreds of pint-sized experts — children ranging from 1½ to 12 years old — came up with the 25 most appealing games and gizmos. They could be destined to become some of the season's biggest sellers. "Whatever your child is interested in, there's a great toy this year in that category, and I think that's what's driving the health of the business,'' says Anne Marie Kehoe, vice president of toys, Walmart U.S ...The top picks include a Num Noms Lip Gloss Truck, which may have particular appeal to budding makeup mavens, a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Mega Lair Playset and a Disney Princess Carriage, one of six of the top 25 toys that are exclusive to Walmart. There's a Little Live Pets Puppy for animal lovers and, for would-be adventurers, a Sky Viper Streaming Drone and a Razor Power Core E100 Electric Scooter. And the force is expected to stay with Star Wars for another year. Just as last year's "Star Wars: The Force Awakens" premiere focused shoppers' attention on all things galactic, the debut of "Rogue One: A Star Wars Story" on Dec. 16 is likely to spur sales of soon-to-be released toys such as the Star Wars Electronic R2D2, another of Walmart's most-popular picks. Walmart doesn't break out sales by product category, but it says toys play a significant role in its holiday revenue. And the season is critical to the toy industry as a whole, which sees 70 percent of its sales in the last two months of the year. Walmart isn't leaving much to chance, not only checking the opinions of its littlest customers, but even working with suppliers to design toys the retailer thinks will have particular appeal, such as the Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice Batcave, which will be another Walmart exclusive with Mattel. "We ... thought this would be a great gift, and the kids who love that brand would really love that play set,'' Kehoe said of Walmart's collaboration with the manufacturer behind the Batman v. Superman toy. Kehoe said toy sales last year remained strong after Christmas on through the spring, and she expects that trend to continue. Still, industrywide, retail sales were not as robust as expected during last year's holiday season. Sales in November and December increased 3 percent to $626.1 billion, below the National Retail Federation's projected uptick of 3.7 percent. The increase was also less than the 4.1 percent growth seen during the 2014 holiday season. Retail experts attributed the more anemic growth to warmer winter weather, an increasing preference for experiences over material gifts and the growing number of consumers who prefer to browse online rather than in brick-and-mortar stores. Online sales surpassed projections last year, rising 9 percent to $105 billion. Beyond toys, Walmart expects cookware, video games and consoles and makeup kits to also be big sellers this holiday season, with the Sony PlayStation Virtual Reality Bundle looking like it will be a particular standout.

By Michael Purdy Owasso, Okla. — A 34-year-old woman was arrested for neglect of child on Friday, after a 4-year-old boy was found inside a vehicle by himself.   Owasso police say the incident happened around 11:55 a.m., at a local Walmart parking lot. "I approached the vehicle and saw the driver side window was down and the keys were in the ignition, but the car was not on," police said.  "The juvenile told me he was hot and wanted me to go get the woman that left him there (Susan Schayer) because she had been in Walmart a while."  When Schayer returned to the vehicle, she claimed they first went to a Walmart in Tulsa and somebody threatened to call DHS because the boy wasn't wearing shoes inside the store.   "She left and drove to the Walmart in Owasso," police said.  "Susan stated that she left the juvenile in the vehicle and went to the bank inside the Walmart to withdraw money." Schayer was then arrested and eventually booked into the Tulsa County Jail.   [Information from arrest and booking report]  There are no comments yet. Be the first to post your thoughts.

Photo courtesy Wikimedia Commons Fight for 15 and a union – the future of organizing? By Mark Gruenberg, Press Associates Union News Service September 2, 2016 Facebook Twitter Google+ Reddit Forward Print The Fight for 15 movement, started in New York City, has spread nationwide. Photo courtesy Wikimedia Commons The Fight for 15 movement, started in New York City, has spread nationwide. Photo courtesy Wikimedia Commons WASHINGTON Are mass movements of low-wage workers, under slogans such as “Fight for 15 and a union,” the future of organizing? The answer, two expert labor lawyers believe, is “Yes.” Judith Scott, general counsel for the Service Employees International Union, and Richard Griffin, general counsel – and top enforcement official – for the National Labor Relations Board, welcome it. But lobbying and legislation to empower the low-wage workers must accompany those movements, they add. Otherwise, the momentum they have built – and are building – will fall. Griffin and Scott offered their views on the future of organizing at a recent symposium on labor law in Washington, D.C. Both have had long careers standing up for workers’ rights and can remember when private-sector union density was far above the current figure of 6.7 percent. “Fight for 15 started with 200 fast-food workers in New York City in November 2012” walking out of their restaurants in a strike over low pay, lack of respect and the right to unionize without employer interference, harassment or law-breaking, Scott said. “Now, it’s spread to thousands of workers in at least 30 cities and to solidarity from other workers in six foreign countries,” she added. And it’s gotten results: Raises in minimum wages at the state and local level nationwide, including $15 minimums in Seattle, its Sea-Tac suburb and New York City, “and even in some Southern cities,” she notes. “But we didn’t send people into small cities in Arkansas, and we were getting calls from” fast food workers there, Scott said. “They told us, ‘We’re on strike. What do we do now?’” The mass movement, which Scott says also “restored the right to strike,” did not succeed in the traditional manner, she noted. Instead of pushing employers to the bargaining table first – via union recognition followed by contract negotiations – it forced them to yield what workers wanted, through legislation and lobbying. Thus the fast food workers in New York not only benefited from a city ordinance, but also, thanks to the political pressure from the mass movement and from SEIU, which backs Fight for 15, and allied unions, from a new state commission investigating low-wage industries. That panel, named by Gov. Andrew Cuomo, declared fast-food as the first industry whose workers deserved a new and higher state minimum wage. Griffin cited a similar movement of Wal-Mart workers, which at least has forced the monster anti-worker retailer to pay attention to its employees and even raise some wages. But that movement, too, has been outside traditional labor law, he noted. Wal-Mart is so anti-worker that the NLRB, including regional officials, has convicted it at least 288 times of breaking labor law as the United Food and Commercial Workers tried to unionize it. But those convictions carried little impact with the retail monster, forcing it only to cough up net back pay and post “we won’t do it again” notices in its stores and warehouses – notices it then disregards with impunity. That tells Griffin “the National Labor Relations Act has not necessarily been flexible enough to accommodate workers.” The Wal-Mart workers’ campaign, however, has also “had the objective of establishing national standards of wages and hours.” Still, if the Wal-Mart workers choose to do so store by store – the U.S. Supreme Court several years ago barred them from a mass class action suit on wage and promotion discrimination against female workers – the process is slow and fraught with obstacles, he admits. “There’s a steady stream of cases, and handling them efficiently is a challenge,” he adds. That’s why the nationwide mass movement, and the strikes it produces, is so important, he adds. But so is the legislation that empowers the workers, and in the absence of a rewrite of the NLRA – blocked by big business and the Republican-run Congress at the start of Democratic President Barack Obama’s term – that’s the way to go, Griffin states. “We’re starting to see tripartite bargaining, where workers don’t have to be restricted to a small collective bargaining table,” covering one union and one employer, he explains. “You have the public involved with an industry” and its standards, or lack of them, and you get results such as Cuomo’s board on low-wage industries, he notes. “That didn’t put people on the streets,” he said of a recent board session in Buffalo “but there were 250 witnesses,” extensive media coverage which brought the issue of low wages and lousy working conditions to public attention “and the result was workers and employers bargaining in public.” Fight for 15 and a union is not the only mass movement out there of restless workers, or citizens, Griffin noted. It shares the same strategy and mobilization tactics with Black Lives Matter, the environmental justice movement, and campaigners for LGBT rights, including workplace rights. Sooner or later, he predicts, all four movements “will have a convergence on their issues,” with all four supporting each other. “It’s important not to suffer from a lack of imagination,” Scott said. “What we’re looking at is a large service sector,” including fast food workers, retail workers, port truckers, Wal-Mart workers, warehouse workers, home health care workers, and adjunct professors “which is suffering the same challenges the industrial sector had” in the 1930s. “We’re going to have to addressed that legally – and with different models” of organizing, she adds. Employers fight back in legislatures and in courts, but that shouldn’t stop the workers, Scott warns. “At SEIU, we say no court case will stand in the way of workers changing their own lives.”            Related Related:  Fight for 15, 15Now, Organizing, Wages, Worker Rights Elsewhere in Worker Power Worker Power January 5, 2017 Home care workers, State of Minnesota agree on union contract ST.

Christinne Muschi / Montreal Gazette Share Adjust Comment Print ST. ALBANS, VERMONT — Amazing what a makeover can do. Just a few years ago, St. Albans was a community struggling to hold on to its identity. After a long fight to keep the giant out, a Walmart store was set to open on the fringe of town. Many downtown storefronts were empty. Was the historic town doomed, people wondered? Quite the opposite: downtown St. Albans has never looked so good. An ambitious  $3-million Main St. overhaul — a project that brought together city hall, residents and businesses — has re-energized this 253-year-old city of 7,000 people. All summer and fall, sidewalk garden boxes cascade with flowers, and people linger at street-side restaurant terrasses.  There’s a Wednesday evening summer concert series, a lively Saturday-morning farmer’s market, public art exhibits and a new crop of businesses housed in the grand, historic red-brick buildings lining Main St. St. Albans is a perfect destination for a day trip from Montreal, an hour and a half’s drive, 25 kilometres south of the Canada-U.S. border. It’s closer than Burlington, which is a perennial favourite among Quebecers. St. Albans is friendly, easy to navigate. Most of what there is to see and do is clustered along Main St. facing Taylor Park, the green space that features one of the prettiest fountains in New England. Stroll, browse in the shops, picnic in the park, have lunch. Nature-lovers might also want to head to the waterfront. St. Albans is set among rolling green pastures. But it also happens to sit right on the shores of Lake Champlain, with a beach and state park within city limits. What to do on a day trip to St. Albans? Here’s a sampling. An ambitious overhaul of Main St. has re-energized St. Albans, a 253-year-old city of 7,000 people. Christinne Muschi / Montreal Gazette Architecture Just wandering the streets is a treat. St. Albans is a compact city covering no more than 2 square miles. Many of its beautiful and well-preserved Victorian and Craftsman-style buildings date back to the city’s heyday as a railway hub in the 1800s. The historic downtown district is clustered along Main St., and around Taylor Park, with its benches, lawns and flower gardens. The park’s centrepiece is one of the most beautiful fountains in all of New England — a 129-year-old, three-tiered cast iron and zinc sculpture (nicknamed “The Ladies” ), which was recently restored. Owner Nancy Hudak stocks a great selection of organic teas, dried fruits and other foods at her dog-friendly Rail City Market. Christinne Muschi / Montreal Gazette Shopping There’s a TJ Maxx on the outskirts of town (in the Highgate Shopping Plaza, 255 Swanton Rd., 802-524-7212) for those who need their discount fix. But meandering along Main St. in St. Albans downtown commercial district is more pleasant. There are no chain stores here. Instead, Main St. is lined with small, independent restaurants, cafés and shops like The Eloquent Page (70 North Main St., 802-527-7243), a used and new bookstore where you might pull a $3 book of Basho haikus out of a bin. A few doors down, there’s a world-class kitchen shop called As The Crow Flies (58 North Main St., 802-524-2800), which has locally made cutting boards and textiles and a brilliant and useful collection of kitchen essentials — from table linens and glassware to utensils and pots and pans.   At the other end of Main St., Rail City Market  (8 South Main St., 802-524-3769) is a natural-foods store housed in a most extraordinary old building. Owner Nancy Hudak stocks a great selection of organic bulk teas, dried fruits and other foods, as well as local Vermont maple products plus a section of locally made jewelry and crafts. This might also be the most dog-friendly place on Earth! Elaine Jones’s antique shop Vintage Vibe features furniture, glassware and several rooms of clothes and collectibles. Christinne Muschi / Montreal Gazette One of my favourite shops is Vintage Vibe (44 South Main St., 802-752-9464), an antique shop filled with stuff from the 1920s to the ’80s at reasonable prices (even for Canadians factoring in the exchange rate.) Owner Elaine Jones is a lifelong collector of all things quirky, cool and colourful who quit her job to open this shop. (She’s the woman behind the counter wearing the fabulous vintage clothes.)  Rugs, table linens, glassware, art, barware, vinyl. Also several rooms of clothes and collectibles on consignment from other vendors. Open Wednesday to Saturday 11 a.m. to 6 p.m., and by appointment. Twiggs American Gastropub, which faces Taylor Park, has a lively atmosphere and good pub food. Christinne Muschi / Montreal Gazette Food There are quite a few restaurants to choose from along Main St., most of them boasting a sidewalk terrasse.  Try Twiggs American Gastropub (24 North Main St., 802-524-1405), with a lively atmosphere and good pub food like burgers, nachos, burgers, mac ‘n’ cheese and fish and chips. The funky interior boasts a rotating exhibit of local art and great music. Mimmo’s Pizza (22 South Main St., 802-524-2244) is a family-run Italian restaurant with great old-school Italian-American pasta, heroes and calzones, plus what is widely recognized to be the best New York-style thin-crust pizza outside of the 212 area code.  Or if it’s a nice day, consider a picnic lunch. Head over to Evelyne’s Fine Foods (15 Center St., 802-782-1852). Evelyn Martin is the baker and pastry chef behind this tiny shop serving salads, sandwiches on freshly made baguettes and pies, tarts and cakes (cream puffs, maple latte cakes and pineapple cheesecakes are among the popular draws.) The Traveled Cup Coffee House is a popular place to hang out. Christinne Muschi / Montreal Gazette There are two great cafés downtown The Traveled Cup Coffee House (94 North Main St., 802-524-2037) is a popular hangout, with comfy sofas and armchairs, serving coffee and fresh-baked sweet and savoury goods. Down the street, Catalyst Coffee (22 North Main St., 802-393-9808) is a newer venture serving fair-trade coffee roasted in Vermont. Espresso and lattes, of course, but also siphon coffee and maple milk and maple limeade (St. Albans is after all, the maple capital of Vermont and host of the spring Maple Festival.) Craft beer fans should stop at  14th Star Brewery Co. (133 North Main St #7, 802 528 5988), located in a former bowling alley. Try the flagship Valor Ale, a hoppy red ale, or one of the other award-winning brews. (Open from 4 p.m. to 10 p.m.; closed Sunday and Monday.) If you are visiting on the weekend, go to the Northwest Farmer’s Market, which sprawls out in Taylor Park every Saturday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m., from mid-May until the end of October. It hosts 45 vendors selling fresh seasonal produce, jams and jellies, wine, meat, poultry and eggs from nearby farms, as well as jewelry, soaps and gift items — all of it grown, baked, foraged or handcrafted by the vendors themselves. There’s plenty of opportunity for snacking, too: sweet and salty kettle corn, Maple City Smoke’s slow-cooked brisket and pulled pork sandwiches, tacos.  Buy a dozen blue-shelled eggs from Mary Gagné’s Araucana hens for $3.50 a dozen. Or choose a sharp, sturdy and environmentally friendly tote bag made from recycled animal-feed sacks, handmade by Abenaki Craftworks ($7). There’s also Hudak Farm Stand and Greenhouse (599 St. Albans Rd., Swanton, 802-527-1147). Three miles north of downtown St. Albans, Hudak’s is a 150-acre family farm that follows organic practices and sells its seasonal fruits and vegetables, as well as local honey, jam, cider, maple syrup, baked goods, cheese and pottery, out of a beautiful barn. Open every day from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. (until 6 p.m. on Sunday) until Nov. 1. Art Art-lovers will want to check out Artist in Residence (10 South Main St., 802-528-5222), a co-operative art gallery featuring the paintings, drawings, jewelry, sculpture and woodworking of 40 member artists, all from Vermont. Each month the gallery showcases the works of several featured artists. History St. Albans Museum (9 Church St., 802-527-7933) is a fun place to visit, chock full of curious and interesting toys, artifacts and other bits of local history. There’s a military room, medical room and even a railroad room in which visitors are transported to a century-old waiting room complete with a ticket seller’s booth and telegraph equipment. It’s housed in a handsome Renaissance Revival-style building flanking Taylor Park. Admission is $6 for adults, $3 for 5 and up. Open Wednesday to Friday from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. and Saturday, 10 to 2. The museum closes for winter in the first week of October and reopens in early June. Nature Outdoorsy types and families with children who need to burn off energy will want to set aside a little time to get up close to Lake Champlain. Drive down Lake St. toward St. Albans Bay to get to Kill Kare State Park (2714 Hathaway Point Rd. 802-524-6021). The park’s official summer season ends on Labour Day weekend. But the grounds are open year-round (though without facilities). There’s a small-cove beach with incredible views of the lake and the Adirondack Mountains in the distance, plus broad lawns for Frisbee throwing and running around. During summer, kayaks and canoes are available for rent and there’s the Island Runner passenger ferry, which crosses seven times daily to Burton Island State Park, with campsites, walking and biking trails. AT A GLANCE To drive to St. Albans from Montreal, cross the Champlain Bridge and take Highway 10E. Get off at Exit 22, and merge onto Highway 35 S toward Highway 89. At St-Sébastien, turn left onto Highway 133S, cross the border into the United States and follow I-89 S to Exit 20. If you decide to stay overnight, check out antique-collector Elaine Jones’s new downtown St. Albans short-term rental apartment, outfitted with midcentury furniture and equipped with vintage vinyl. It will be available on AirBnB (under the heading “vintage therapy in Vermont”) as of Sept. 25. Before then, call Jones at 802-752-9464 for information or to reserve. Or you could try the “unfussy” Cadillac Motel, (213 South Main St., 802-370-3082), which is walking distance from downtown.   ssemenak@postmedia.com The right prescription for a good night’s sleep Susan Schwartz: Small, even tiny, moments can be momentous Comments We encourage all readers to share their views on our articles and blog posts.

They don’t have a lot of time. Giant container ships from the South Korean-based Hanjin shipping line are marooned with their cargo of what experts say are lots of TVs and printers, but also loads of home furnishings and clothing. Hanjin, the world’s seventh-largest container shipper, filed for bankruptcy protection Wednesday and stopped accepting new cargo. With its assets being frozen, ships from China to Canada were refused permission to offload or take aboard containers because there were no guarantees that tugboat pilots or stevedores would be paid. It’s also been a factor in shipping rates rising and could hurt some trucking firms with contracts to pick up goods from Hanjin ships. The South Korean giant represents nearly 8 percent of the trans-Pacific trade volume for the U.S. market. While some retailers may already have merchandise for the holiday season affected, experts say what’s most important is that the issue be resolved before the critical shipping month of October. “Retailers always have robust contingency plans, but this degree of uncertainty is making it challenging to put those plans in place,” said Jessica Dankert, senior director of retail operations for the Retail Industry Leaders Association, a trade alliance with members including companies like Best Buy, Wal-Mart and Target. J.C. Penney said Hanjin is one of several ocean freight carriers that it uses and when it learned there might be an issue it began to divert and reroute its containers. It said it uses “a variety of transportation methods and ports” and right now does not expect a significant effect on the flow of merchandise. Target Corp. said it is watching the situation closely and Wal-Mart said it is waiting for details about Hanjin’s bankruptcy proceedings and the implications to its merchandise before it could assess the effect. As of Friday, 27 ships had been refused entry to ports or terminals, said Hanjin Shipping spokesman Park Min. The Seoul-based company said one ship in Singapore had been seized by the ship’s owner. At the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, the nation’s busiest port complex, three Hanjin container ships ranging from about 700 feet to 1,100 feet (213 meters to 304 meters) long were either drifting offshore or anchored away from terminals on Thursday. A fourth vessel that was supposed to leave Long Beach on Thursday morning remained anchored inside the breakwater. “Hanjin called us and said: ‘We’re going bankrupt and we can’t pay any bills — so don’t bother asking,’ “ said J. Kip Louttit, executive director of the Marine Exchange of Southern California, which provides traffic control for the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. That’s meant cargo headed to and from Asia is in limbo, much to the distress of merchants looking to stock shelves with fall fashions or Christmas toys. “Someone from the garment industry called earlier today asking: ‘How long is this going to go on, because I’ve got clothing out there,”’ Louttit said. Chris Rogers, a research analyst at Panjiva, which tracks international imports to the United States, said the situation isn’t yet dire but could become so. October is the busiest month for cargo from South Korea to the U.S., accounting for about 11.5 percent of the annual total. But South Korea’s maritime ministry said Hanjin’s troubles would affect cargo exports for two to three months, given that August-October is a high-demand season for deep-sea routes. The Retail Industry Leaders Association wrote to U.S. Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker and Federal Maritime Commission Chairman Mario Cordero on Thursday, urging them to work with the South Korean government, ports and others to prevent disruptions. It said the bankruptcy is rippling through the global supply chain and could cause significant harm to consumers and the U.S. economy. “There (are) millions of dollars’ worth of merchandise that needs to be on store shelves that could be impacted by this,” said Jonathan Gold, the National Retail Federation’s vice president for supply chain and customs policy. The confusion might also sink some trucking firms that contract with Hanjin to deliver cargo containers from ports to company loading bays. “They’ve got bills to pay — they could literally close their doors over this,” said Peter Schneider, Fresno-based vice president of T.G.S. Transportation Inc. Other shipping lines may take on some of Hanjin’s traffic — but at a price. Since many vessels already are operating at high capacity, shippers may wind up paying a premium to squeeze their containers on board, said Jock O’Connell, international trade adviser to Los Angeles-based Beacon Economics. The price of shipping a 40-foot container from China to the U.S. jumped up to 50 percent in a single day, said Nerijus Poskus, director of pricing and procurement for Flexport, a licensed freight forwarder and customs broker based in San Francisco. The price from China to West Coast ports rose from $1,100 per container to as much as $1,700 on Thursday, while the cost from China to the East Coast jumped from $1,700 to $2,400, he said. Hanjin’s bankruptcy was a major factor, he said. Global demand and trade have suffered since the 2008 recession, but steamship lines continued to build more and larger vessels. That weaker trade and overcapacity have sent ocean shipping rates plunging in recent years. A few months ago, Poskus said, prices hit historic lows globally — down to as much as $600 per container from Shanghai to Los Angeles. That wouldn’t even cover fuel costs for the huge ships, he said. Poskus expects the spike in prices to last a month or two. With about 5 percent of ships in the global trading fleet sitting idle, he believes there is room to take over Hanjin’s capacity and carriers already are discussing the possibility of adding ships. But he said prices would have to rise in order to be sustainable. ——— Jablon reported from Los Angeles.

Rush to Walmart, get your 50 cents school supplies, and hit the road to the big, beautiful, brick layout of the home you’ve come to know: Kouts High School! Starting August 17th, not only have we added two new teachers to our wonderful staff, but we’ve added new classes, as well! Welcome to our high school faculty, science teacher Mr. Slys and history teacher Mr. Wisniewski! As for the new classes such as anatomy and earth science, welcome to you, too! Oh, and how could I forget the summer plans that were a secret until registration! We’ve been updated! Yes, that yucky, green bathroom tile has been demolished and re-done into a chic space accented with grey, gold, and white. It’s a space that any girl or guy would love to spend their times doing the daily grind. The biggest surprise of all is a brand new cafeteria. From high and low tables to accommodate even our shortest of students, to chairs, and even to spectacular gold, black, and grey carpet, the cafeteria is fully remodeled. Did I mention we blew out a wall? A few doors were completely blown out and forgotten in a pile of rubble. The space was left as a giant opening to accentuate the space. It’s out with the old and in with the new here at Kouts High School! We wish a great year to the new teachers, new students, and the students coming back! Kouts National Holiday Once again we’ve come to the time of the year where we stuff our faces proudly with food too good to be healthy and spend money like nobody’s business because here in the tiny town of Kouts, Porkfest is a holiday. The Porkfest started off with a parade featuring the marching band, poms girls, cheerleaders, classic cars, floats, and candy sprinkled in between. That’s not it,though; there’s more to do! You can walk down main street and donate to the lovely ladies of the poms team, get your face painted, even watch a pork-eating contest, and there is even a pig. Yes, a fat pig whose weight is just dying to be guessed. There are also giant, brightly colored inflatable bounce houses that your little kids can run, jump, and dive into, not to mention the miniature ponies that your little kiddos can also ride! Pork burgers, shakes, sundaes, curly fries, sugar candy, roasted pork, fried mushrooms, huge ice cream cones, and some juicy hot dogs are all available. You can also expect live entertainment! A stage is set up and you can hear music all day during the fest as you walk down the street. Although there was rain in the morning, the day turned into a warm 80 degrees, with the sun shining and the skies blue! All in all, the day was a success and the Porkfest was great like every other year. Shout out to Two of a Kind This year at Kouts we’ve welcomed two new teachers into our high school faculty. Mr. Slys, our new addition to our science section, and Mr. Wisniewski, our new addition to the history section. I had the chance to interview Mr. Wisniewski. With intent of being a teacher from the get go, Mr. W eventually found himself at Indiana University where he graduated and made his way to Wisconsin. He’s been teaching ever since at Thomas Edison Jr/Sr High School. When asked why he chose Kouts, Mr. W said that he actually did some student teaching in Kouts about 19 years ago and always wanted to return if the right opportunity arose. Once here, Mr. W loved it, feeling that everyone was very welcoming and supportive! I then went on to ask what Mr. W’s philosophy for teaching would be and he said that he always wants to make sure students get something useful out of his class, “It may be in skill development, knowledge expansion, or simply a safe place to be.” Mr. W says that his favorite time period to teach would be the Antebellum period, a time just prior to the Civil War. He believes this is truly when America went through growing pains and he finds it ultimately fascinating! Thanks so much for interviewing with me, Mr. W, and congrats to both the teachers and their years forward teaching here at our home- Kouts High School! Spikes and Goals The Volleyball girls started the year off fabulously when both teams went 3-1 and landed themselves in the championship match of the Marquette Invitational. Leading the JV team against 4A South Bend Adams team was Lauren Aguirre and Olivia Kropp. Leading the team in Varsity against 4A John Adams School was Sarah Clinton with 5 aces, Kyla Roney with 18 assists, Chloe Koedyker with 15 digs, Hannah Maier with 17 kills, and Sadie Leatherman and Meagan Farmer with 10 combined blocks! The Volleyball girls aren’t the only ones taking in wins for Kouts. On August 22nd, the Kouts Mustangs Soccer team won against Westville six to zero! This night was a night of goals for the team, starting off with freshman Alex Gurekovich who scored his first career goal, but also added two more goals after that. Zach Bender scored his first career goal as well. Broc Kneifel added two more goals and Hunter Schultz swung in with two assists. Sam Kropp, Matthew Woodbury, and Todd Fox each added an assist. The Mustangs that night were 2-1 overall and 1-0 in league play. The cross country team has also been on a roll, running extremely well at the Valpo invite at Sunset Hill August 23rd. Jay Heinold led the boys with a 7th place finish followed by Kody Dick, Logan Davis, Chase Jefferson, Drew Saulsgiver, Hunter Yager, Waco Sebastian, and Nolan Miller. The girls team was led by Holly Kuebler’s first place finish followed by McKenna Palmer’s third place finish, and then Ryleigh Cadwell, Anne Marie Shara, and Lexi Demarco!

They don’t have a lot of time. Giant container ships from the South Korean-based Hanjin shipping line are marooned with their cargo of what experts say are lots of TVs and printers, but also loads of home furnishings and clothing. Hanjin, the world’s seventh-­largest container shipper, filed for bankruptcy protection Wednesday and stopped accepting new cargo. With its assets being frozen, ships from China to Canada were refused permission to offload or take aboard containers because there were no guarantees that tugboat pilots or stevedores would be paid. It’s also been a factor in shipping rates rising and could hurt some trucking firms with contracts to pick up goods from Hanjin ships. The South Korean giant represents nearly 8 percent of the trans-Pacific trade volume for the U.S. market. While some retailers may already have merchandise for the holiday season affected, experts say what’s most important is that the issue be resolved before the critical shipping month of October. “Retailers always have robust contingency plans, but this degree of uncertainty is making it challenging to put those plans in place,” said Jessica Dankert, senior director of retail operations for the Retail Industry Leaders Association, a trade alliance with members including companies like Best Buy, Wal-Mart and Target. J.C. Penney said Hanjin is one of several ocean freight carriers that it uses and when it learned there might be an issue it began to divert and reroute its containers. It said it uses “a variety of transportation methods and ports” and right now does not expect a significant effect on the flow of merchandise. Target Corp. said it is watching the situation closely, and Wal-Mart said it is waiting for details about Hanjin’s bankruptcy proceedings and the implications to its merchandise before it could assess the effect. As of Friday, 27 ships had been refused entry to ports or terminals, Hanjin Shipping spokesman Park Min said. The Seoul-based company said one ship in Singapore had been seized by the ship’s owner. At the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, the nation’s busiest port complex, three Hanjin container ships ranging from about 700 feet to 1,100 feet long were either drifting offshore or anchored away from terminals on Thursday. A fourth vessel that was supposed to leave Long Beach on Thursday morning remained anchored inside the breakwater. “Hanjin called us and said: ‘We’re going bankrupt and we can’t pay any bills — so don’t bother asking,’ ” said J. Kip Louttit, executive director of the Marine Exchange of Southern California, which provides traffic control for the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. That’s meant cargo headed to and from Asia is in limbo, much to the distress of merchants looking to stock shelves with fall fashions or Christmas toys. “Someone from the garment industry called earlier today asking: ‘How long is this going to go on, because I’ve got clothing out there,’ ” Louttit said. Chris Rogers, a research analyst at Panjiva, which tracks international imports to the United States, said the situation isn’t yet dire but could become so. October is the busiest month for cargo from South Korea to the U.S., accounting for about 11.5 percent of the annual total. But South Korea’s maritime ministry said Hanjin’s troubles would affect cargo exports for two to three months, given that August-October is a high-demand season for deep-sea routes. The Retail Industry Leaders Association wrote to U.S. Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker and Federal Maritime Commission Chairman Mario Cordero on Thursday, urging them to work with the South Korean government, ports and others to prevent disruptions. It said the bankruptcy is rippling through the global supply chain and could cause significant harm to consumers and the U.S. economy. “There (are) millions of dollars’ worth of merchandise that needs to be on store shelves that could be impacted by this,” said Jonathan Gold, the National Retail Federation’s vice president for supply chain and customs policy. The confusion might also sink some trucking firms that contract with Hanjin to deliver cargo containers from ports to company loading bays. “They’ve got bills to pay — they could literally close their doors over this,” said Peter Schneider, Fresno-based vice president of T.G.S. Transportation Inc. Other shipping lines may take on some of Hanjin’s traffic — but at a price. Since many vessels already are operating at high capacity, shippers may wind up paying a premium to squeeze their containers on board, said Jock O’Connell, international trade adviser to Los Angeles-based Beacon Economics. The price of shipping a 40-foot container from China to the U.S. jumped up to 50 percent in a single day, said Nerijus Poskus, director of pricing and procurement for Flexport, a licensed freight forwarder and customs broker based in San Francisco. The price from China to West Coast ports rose from $1,100 per container to as much as $1,700 on Thursday, while the cost from China to the East Coast jumped from $1,700 to $2,400, he said. Hanjin’s bankruptcy was a major factor, he said. Global demand and trade have suffered since the 2008 recession, but steamship lines continued to build more and larger vessels. That weaker trade and overcapacity have sent ocean shipping rates plunging in recent years. A few months ago, Poskus said, prices hit historic lows globally — down to as much as $600 per container from Shanghai to Los Angeles. That wouldn’t even cover fuel costs for the huge ships, he said. Poskus expects the spike in prices to last a month or two. With about 5 percent of ships in the global trading fleet sitting idle, he believes there is room to take over Hanjin’s capacity and carriers already are discussing the possibility of adding ships. But he said prices would have to rise in order to be sustainable.

An anonymous reader quotes a report from Yahoo: The clairvoyant folks over at the World Economic Forum warned of a "Fourth Industrial Revolution" involving the rise of the machine in the workforce, and the latest company to lend credence to that claim is none other than Walmart, which is planning on cutting 7,000 jobs on account of automation. But the Walmart decision may be a bit more alarming for those in the workforce. As the Wall Street Journal reports (Warning: may be paywalled), the most concerning aspect of America's largest private employer might be that the eliminated positions are largely in the accounting and invoicing sectors of the company. These jobs are typically held by some of the longest tenured employees, who also happen to take home higher hourly wages. Now, those coveted positions are being automated. The Journal reports that beginning in 2017, much of this work will be addressed by "a central office or new money-counting 'cash recycler' machines in stores." Earlier this year, the company tested this change across some 500 locations. "We've seen many make smooth transitions during the pilot," said Deisha Barnett, a Walmart spokeswoman. business money news ← Related Links → Feds Spend Nearly $500K To 'Combat Online Trolling' Walmart Now Lets You Pay With Phone At All 4,600 US Stores Via Walmart Pay Walmart Buys Jet For $3 Billion, Hopes To Turbo Charge Ecommerce Man Becomes 'Accidental Millionaire' After Jet.com's Sale To Walmart Submission: Walmart Is Cutting 7,000 Jobs Due To Automation Walmart Tests Blockchain For Use In Food Recalls FDA Bans 19 Chemicals Used In Antibacterial Soaps This discussion has been archived.

I'm sorry, but you've got that wrong: In the United States, a few limited eight-hour-day laws were on the books shortly after the Civil War. One, in Illinois, was passed in 1867, followed in 1868 by a law covering certain classes of federal workers. But neither law was well-enforced, and in most sectors, working hours of 10 to 12 hours were common. So a reduction in the work week became a leading issue for the nascent labor movement. The issue came to a head in 1884, after the Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions -- a predecessor of today’s AFL-CIO -- called for all workers to have eight-hour days by May 1, 1886. When that deadline wasn’t met, labor leaders upped the ante by calling for demonstrations. In Chicago, peaceful marches morphed into violence, with an explosion marring a rally at Haymarket Square on May 4, 1886, leaving seven police officers and four workers dead. Subsequent trials, executions and clemencies for the accused made the eight-hour week a top issue nationally and internationally. All of this occurred decades before Ford founded his company in 1903. Ford didn't implement the 40 hour workweek until 1926. http://www.politifact.com/trut... [politifact.com] http://www.businessinsider.com...

It turns out, however, that survival of the fittest is not always the best approach when you want to hold a society together. That is why we have things like anti monopoly rules. The "end game" for capitalism is to eliminate all competition so that in the end, there is only one. This of course is massively short sighted, given that most of the population will won't have jobs and then cannot afford to buy your stuff.

Then we automate enough of the manufacturing sector to reduce it to 8% of the population, not including the millions of offahored factory jobs. Then we tell everyone they have to go to college and get at least a 4 year degree to have any hope of a stable future. The vast majority of people at non-top tier universities are doing the minimum required to get a degree, majoring in business or psychology or communications. In the past, all of those people were absorbed into random entry-level positions doing the kind of work Walmart is now automating. It's a ritual - party through 4 years, show up at the campus career center during your senior year, do a few interviews and pick Random Large Employer to work for as a Random Paper Processing Position. What exactly are people proposing that we do with these "C students," who number in the millions and contribute to society through taxes, buying stuff and raising little C students? - Most of them don't have the aptitude for tech careers (many of which are being automated as well...) - Most of them can't be trained in a skilled trade without asking them to go back through another 4 years of apprenticeship - Almost none can become doctors, lawyers, etc. because the competition is so keen to get in to medical/law school - They can't be investment bankers or management consultants, because those professions only recruit from the Ivy League I know it's no one's dream to process paperwork, but it has traditionally been one of the most stable ways for middle-skilled people to earn a living and have a career. Students starting out as a Associate Paper Processor have the opportunity to become a Senior Paper Processor, then a Paper Processor Supervisor, Manager of Paper Processing, Director of Document Services, and so on. For everyone in corporate IT, think of all the paper processors we directly support, working away in their cubicles. Most are incapable of doing any more than a defined procedure on an input stack of work. If you suddenly say all these people are unemployed, what do you propose replacing their jobs with? When that good salary goes away, the government doesn't get its payroll tax, the unemployed person chooses not to buy a house and therefore doesn't pay property taxes into the system, they choose not to procreate and reduce the birth rate to an unsustainable level. And, they don't buy anything, meaning businesses can't sell the products they make. I'm not saying we become Luddites and stop the automation, but we as a whole need to think about what we're going to do with a very large disaffected population. Look how much support Trump has among factory workers who are still unemployed or underemployed even though everyone's being told the economy is in OK shape. I'm one of those people who feels that full employment above all else should be the goal, even if we do make-work for some of it. You can't have millions of people sitting around with nothing to do and no purpose -- it will lead to massive crime over the long run as people get bored and tired of being broke.

[marshallbrain.com] Manna's job was to manage the store, and it did this in a most interesting way. Think about a normal fast food restaurant. A group of employees worked at the store, typically 50 people in a normal restaurant, and they rotated in and out on a weekly schedule. The people did everything from making the burgers to taking the orders to cleaning the tables and taking out the trash. All of these employees reported to the store manager and a couple of assistant managers. The managers hired the employees, scheduled them and told them what to do each day. This was a completely normal arrangement. In the early twenty-first century, there were millions of businesses that operated in this way. But the fast food industry had a problem, and Burger-G was no different. The problem was the quality of the fast food experience. Some restaurants were run perfectly. They had courteous and thoughtful crew members, clean restrooms, great customer service and high accuracy on the orders. Other restaurants were chaotic and uncomfortable to customers. Since one bad experience could turn a customer off to an entire chain of restaurants, these poorly-managed stores were the Achilles heel of any chain. To solve the problem, Burger-G contracted with a software consultant and commissioned a piece of software. The goal of the software was to replace the managers and tell the employees what to do in a more controllable way. Manna version 1.0 was born. ... The first part is a rather depression dystopia.

They don’t have a lot of time. Giant containerships from the South Korean-based Hanjin shipping line are marooned with their cargo of what experts say are lots of TVs and printers, but also loads of home furnishings and clothing. Hanjin, the world’s seventh-largest container shipper, filed for bankruptcy protection Wednesday and stopped accepting new cargo. With its assets being frozen, ships from China to Canada were refused permission to offload or take aboard containers because there were no guarantees that tugboat pilots or stevedores would be paid. It’s also been a factor in shipping rates rising and could hurt some trucking firms with contracts to pick up goods from Hanjin ships. The South Korean giant represents nearly 8 percent of the trans-Pacific trade volume for the U.S. market. While some retailers may already have merchandise for the holiday season affected, experts say what’s most important is that the issue be resolved before the critical shipping month of October. “Retailers always have robust contingency plans, but this degree of uncertainty is making it challenging to put those plans in place,” said Jessica Dankert, senior director of retail operations for the Retail Industry Leaders Association, a trade alliance with members including companies like Best Buy, Wal-Mart and Target. J.C. Penney said Hanjin is one of several ocean freight carriers that it uses and when it learned there might be an issue it began to divert and reroute its containers. It said it uses “a variety of transportation methods and ports” and right now does not expect a significant effect on the flow of merchandise. Target Corp. said it is watching the situation closely and Wal-Mart said it is waiting for details about Hanjin’s bankruptcy proceedings and the implications to its merchandise before it could assess the effect. As of Friday, 27 ships had been refused entry to ports or terminals, said Hanjin Shipping spokesman Park Min. The Seoul-based company said one ship in Singapore had been seized by the ship’s owner. There has been little impact at the Port of Charleston because no Hanjin ships were scheduled to arrive in the days after the bankruptcy. The State Ports Authority said it will not handle any Hanjin-shipped exports and will demand payment in advance for imports until further notice. At the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, the nation’s busiest port complex, three Hanjin containerships ranging from about 700 feet to 1,100 feet long were either drifting offshore or anchored away from terminals Thursday. A fourth vessel that was supposed to leave Long Beach on Thursday morning remained anchored inside the breakwater. “Hanjin called us and said: ‘We’re going bankrupt and we can’t pay any bills — so don’t bother asking,’ ” said J. Kip Louttit, executive director of the Marine Exchange of Southern California, which provides traffic control for the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. That’s meant cargo headed to and from Asia is in limbo, much to the distress of merchants looking to stock shelves with fall fashions or Christmas toys. “Someone from the garment industry called earlier today asking: ‘How long is this going to go on, because I’ve got clothing out there’,” Louttit said. Chris Rogers, a research analyst at Panjiva, which tracks international imports to the United States, said the situation isn’t yet dire but could become so. October is the busiest month for cargo from South Korea to the U.S., accounting for about 11.5 percent of the annual total. But South Korea’s maritime ministry said Hanjin’s troubles would affect cargo exports for two to three months, given that August-October is a high-demand season for deep-sea routes. The Retail Industry Leaders Association wrote to U.S. Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker and Federal Maritime Commission Chairman Mario Cordero on Thursday, urging them to work with the South Korean government, ports and others to prevent disruptions. It said the bankruptcy is rippling through the global supply chain and could cause significant harm to consumers and the U.S. economy. “There (are) millions of dollars’ worth of merchandise that needs to be on store shelves that could be impacted by this,” said Jonathan Gold, the National Retail Federation’s vice president for supply chain and customs policy. The confusion might also sink some trucking firms that contract with Hanjin to deliver cargo containers from ports to company loading bays. “They’ve got bills to pay — they could literally close their doors over this,” said Peter Schneider, Fresno-based vice president of T.G.S. Transportation Inc. Other shipping lines may take on some of Hanjin’s traffic — but at a price. Since many vessels already are operating at high capacity, shippers may wind up paying a premium to squeeze their containers on board, said Jock O’Connell, international trade adviser to Los Angeles-based Beacon Economics. The price of shipping a 40-foot container from China to the U.S. jumped up to 50 percent in a single day, said Nerijus Poskus, director of pricing and procurement for Flexport, a licensed freight forwarder and customs broker based in San Francisco. The price from China to West Coast ports rose from $1,100 per container to as much as $1,700 on Thursday, while the cost from China to the East Coast jumped from $1,700 to $2,400, he said. Hanjin’s bankruptcy was a major factor, he said. Global demand and trade have suffered since the 2008 recession, but steamship lines continued to build more and larger vessels. Weaker trade and overcapacity have sent ocean shipping rates plunging in recent years. A few months ago, Poskus said, prices hit historic lows globally — down to as much as $600 per container from Shanghai to Los Angeles. That wouldn’t even cover fuel costs for the huge ships, he said. Poskus expects the spike in prices to last a month or two. With about 5 percent of ships in the global trading fleet sitting idle, he believes there is room to take over Hanjin’s capacity and carriers already are discussing the possibility of adding ships. But he said prices would have to rise in order to be sustainable.

Supplied photo. Metro and Wal-Mart are among the Ontario grocery stores who can begin selling wine come Oct. 28. Ontario announced today the first grocers that could sell both domestic and imported wine inside up to 70 grocery stores across the province. The winning grocers were selected in a competitive bidding process held by the Liquor Control Board of Ontario (LCBO).  In a news release, Ontario said the stores selected represent “a mix of independent and large grocers and geographic representation” aimed at ensuring fairness. Eventually, up to 450 grocery stores will be authorized to sell beer and cider and, of these, up to 300 may also sell wine.  Up to 70 existing winery retail stores that operate just outside a grocery store's checkout will also be permitted to operate inside the store and share the checkout. These “wine boutiques” will broaden their assortment to sell wines made by other Ontario producers, and will be located at grocery stores that sell beer. These wine boutiques will be permitted to begin operating this fall, at the same time as wine is introduced to grocery stores.

(Stephen Carr/The Daily Breeze via AP) NEW YORK • Some major retailers are scrambling to work out contingency plans to get their merchandise to stores after the bankruptcy of the Hanjin shipping line has thrown ports and retailers around the world into confusion. They don’t have a lot of time. Giant container ships from South Korea-based Hanjin are marooned with their cargo of what experts say are lots of TVs and printers but also loads of home furnishings and clothing. Hanjin, the world’s seventh-largest container shipper, filed for bankruptcy protection Wednesday and stopped accepting new cargo. With its assets frozen, ships from China to Canada were refused permission to offload or take aboard containers because there were no guarantees that tugboat pilots or stevedores would be paid. It also has been a factor in rising shipping rates and could hurt some trucking firms with contracts to pick up goods from Hanjin ships. The company represents nearly 8 percent of the trans-Pacific trade volume for the U.S. market. While some retailers may already have merchandise for the holiday season affected, experts say what’s most important is that the issue be resolved before the critical shipping month of October. “Retailers always have robust contingency plans, but this degree of uncertainty is making it challenging to put those plans in place,” said Jessica Dankert, senior director of retail operations for the Retail Industry Leaders Association, a trade alliance with members including Best Buy, Wal-Mart and Target. J.C. Penney said Hanjin is one of several ocean freight carriers it uses and when it learned there might be an issue it began to divert and reroute its containers. It said it uses “a variety of transportation methods and ports” and right now does not expect a significant effect on the flow of merchandise. Target Corp. said it is watching the situation closely, and Wal-Mart said it is waiting for details about Hanjin’s bankruptcy proceedings and the implications to its merchandise before it could assess the effect. As of Friday, 27 ships had been refused entry to ports or terminals, Hanjin Shipping spokesman Park Min said. The Seoul-based company said one ship in Singapore had been seized by the ship’s owner. At the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, the nation’s busiest port complex, three Hanjin container ships ranging from about 700 feet to 1,100 feet long were either drifting offshore or anchored away from terminals on Thursday. A fourth vessel that was supposed to leave Long Beach on Thursday morning remained anchored inside the breakwater. “Hanjin called us and said: ‘We’re going bankrupt and we can’t pay any bills — so don’t bother asking,’” said J. Kip Louttit, executive director of the Marine Exchange of Southern California, which provides traffic control for the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. That’s meant cargo headed to and from Asia is in limbo, much to the distress of merchants looking to stock shelves with fall fashions or Christmas toys. ”Someone from the garment industry called earlier today asking: ‘How long is this going to go on, because I’ve got clothing out there,’” Louttit said. Chris Rogers, a research analyst at Panjiva, which tracks international imports to the United States, said the situation isn’t yet dire but could become so. October is the busiest month for cargo from South Korea to the U.S., accounting for about 11.5 percent of the annual total. But South Korea’s maritime ministry said Hanjin’s troubles would affect cargo exports for two to three months, given that August-October is a high-demand season for deep-sea routes. The Retail Industry Leaders Association wrote to U.S. Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker and Federal Maritime Commission Chairman Mario Cordero on Thursday, urging them to work with the South Korean government, ports and others to prevent disruptions. It said the bankruptcy is rippling through the global supply chain and could cause significant harm to consumers and the U.S. economy. Get the Bottom Line from Nicklaus and Gallagher Who's hired?

The confusion might also sink some trucking firms that contract with Hanjin to deliver cargo containers from ports to company loading bays. “They’ve got bills to pay — they could literally close their doors over this,” said Peter Schneider, Fresno-based vice president of T.G.S. Transportation Inc. Other shipping lines may take on some of Hanjin’s traffic — but at a price. Since many vessels already are operating at high capacity, shippers may wind up paying a premium to squeeze their containers on board, said Jock O’Connell, international trade adviser to Los Angeles-based Beacon Economics. The price of shipping a 40-foot container from China to the U.S. jumped up to 50 percent in a single day, said Nerijus Poskus, director of pricing and procurement for Flexport, a licensed freight forwarder and customs broker based in San Francisco. The price from China to West Coast ports rose from $1,100 per container to as much as $1,700 on Thursday, while the cost from China to the East Coast jumped from $1,700 to $2,400, he said. Hanjin’s bankruptcy was a major factor, he said. Global demand and trade have suffered since the 2008 recession, but steamship lines continued to build more and larger vessels. That weaker trade and overcapacity have sent ocean shipping rates plunging in recent years. A few months ago, Poskus said, prices hit historic lows globally — down to as much as $600 per container from Shanghai to Los Angeles. That wouldn’t even cover fuel costs for the huge ships, he said. Poskus expects the spike in prices to last a month or two. With about 5 percent of ships in the global trading fleet sitting idle, he believes there is room to take over Hanjin’s capacity and carriers already are discussing the possibility of adding ships. But he said prices would have to rise in order to be sustainable. Business Briefing from St. Louis Post-Dispatch Make it your business.

With this in mind, every Friday TriplePundit will give you a fun, easy read on a topic you care about. So, take a break from those endless email threads and spend five minutes catching up on the latest trends in sustainability and business. Zipcar and Yakima think car ownership shouldn’t be a prerequisite for seeing the redwoods. In this day and age, everything is changing. Each day brings with it a new smartphone, wearable device or tech-driven service that promises to make our lives simpler and easier. These “disruptive” innovations span every industry, from energy generation to agriculture. But perhaps no industry is evolving more quickly than transportation — and it probably needs to be that way: This year, transportation outpaced the utility sector as America’s largest carbon emitter. This shift brings with it an unavoidable need to cut those emissions down to size, particularly as the U.S. and China aim to formally join the Paris agreement before the G20 Summit this weekend. The emissions cuts the agreement requires demand big change. And no single company can go it alone. Fortunately, this reality hasn’t escaped big players in the space. This week we round up seven partnerships that aim to revolutionize transportation. Do you think they can? Ford taps partners for driverless cars Ford CEO Mark Fields made a big announcement last month: “Ford will be mass-producing vehicles with full autonomy, within five years.” Ford is hardly the first company to eye driverless cars in earnest. But Fields’ announcement of a mass-produced model goes the furthest so far. And while rumors circulated that the automaker would link up with Google to develop autonomous cars, the partnership has yet to materialize. That said, Ford won’t go it alone when it comes to the next generation of personal transport. Four new partnerships — with Velodyne, SAIPS, Nirenberg Neuroscience and Civil Maps — will help the automaker hone functions like distance sensing and machine learning. And while the Google partnership seems to be on the back burner, we wouldn’t count it out just yet. This spring, the two companies joined a cohort of stakeholders advocating for federal approval of driverless cars. And Ford may need more partners if it hopes to make a mass-produced vehicle a reality by 2021. GM bets big on Lyft… As the two largest ride-sharing services, Uber and Lyft, battle it out for domination in the future of transit, automakers previously tied to personal mobility are wary of being left behind. With the financial crisis and auto bailout still top of mind, many are surprised General Motors even made it this far, but the automaker has no plans to throw in the towel. And with a new partner in Lyft, GM could be ready to turn over a new leaf. At the start of this year, GM announced it would invest $500 million in the ride-sharing company to envision the future of auto transport. GM will provide cars at “hubs” for Lyft drivers who want to make some spare cash, but don’t necessarily own a car. The companies also say collaboration on autonomous-driving technology will be a component of the partnership. … and Toyota strikes back with Uber The Marai is only part of Toyota’s future plans. A few months after GM linked up with Lyft, Japanese automaker Toyota announced a “strategic partnership” of its own — with Lyft’s larger rival, Uber. Toyota said it planned to offer cars to Uber drivers through “flexible” leasing plans. The automaker didn’t disclose how much it invested in Uber. But a source close to the situation told the Wall Street Journal that the figure was under $100 million, far lower than GM’s investment in Lyft. But the Japanese auto label is making moves, and those dollars and cents may not matter. The creator of America’s most popular hybrid, the Prius, is now out to revive the oft-discounted hydrogen economy. Toyota’s hydrogen-fueled Mirai made its debut this year, turning heads in the clean-tech space. (3p’s Bill Roth tested the Mirai side-by-side with the Tesla Model S. Click here to check it out.) And Uber is making moves of its own, although not the ones labor advocates may like. Despite its car-leasing partnership with Toyota, Uber is rapidly expanding its own leasing service, Xchange Leasing, which critics say is often predatory. Walmart tests delivery services with ride-sharing giants Gone are the days of hauling rickety carts up to that fifth-floor walk-up. If you live in a major American city, chances are you have at least a few options for getting your groceries delivered. Startups like FreshDirect made a splash in the space. And larger competitors, like Amazon and its Amazon Fresh service, are now looking to jump on the bandwagon. You can now add Walmart to the list — and the big-box retailer hopes a secret weapon can help it take the lead. At its annual shareholders meeting this summer, Walmart announced it would explore a partnership with Uber and Lyft to expand its grocery-delivery service. In a few test locations, Walmart customers will submit their online orders, personalized shoppers will gather the items, and then an Uber or Lyft driver will haul the order the “last mile” to the delivery destination. As is often the case with Walmart — and Uber and Lyft, for that matter — some questioned how well the partnership will work out for employees. We’ll keep an eye on this one as it develops. Zipcar and Yakima deliver outdoor adventure to urbanites Zipcar is the world’s leading car-sharing network. Yakima Products makes vehicle racks and cargo solutions. It seems like a match made in heaven. And in August, they proved it is. Thanks to a new partnership, the two companies will bring Yakima bike, ski and surfboard carriers to Zipcars in North America. This exclusive deal enables Zipcar members to enjoy their favorite outdoor activities outside of the city without the cost and hassle of owning a car (or perilously bungee-cording bicycles into the trunk of a rented sedan). According to the Outdoor Industry Association, 34 percent of the outdoor consumer market lives in cities. The partnership enables urban adventurers to “live a car-free or car-light lifestyle without sacrificing their ability to get out of the city and enjoy their favorite outdoor activities,” the two companies said in a press release. More than 150 Zipcars in 17 North American markets will receive the new treatment. Tesla and Panasonic build battery ‘Gigafactory’ Back in 2014, the partnership between Panasonic and Tesla was the handshake heard round the world. The time-honored tech firm and electric-vehicle upstart agreed to work together on a battery ‘Gigafactory.’ The completed factory, they promised, would support the manufacture of 500,000 electric cars per year, and also produce utility-scale batteries fit for municipal energy storage. No sooner had the partners announced their plans than states began lining up to host the new factory. In the end, it was Nevada that came out victorious. But that was over two years ago. How are things progressing? Well, it depends on who you ask. Tesla CEO Elon Musk told a group of journalists this summer that EV batteries will start coming off the assembly line next year. That’s a pretty optimistic statement considering that the factory was less than 15 percent completed as of late July. But 1,000 people are working seven days a week to hit the deadline, reported Jack Stewart of Wired. After acquiring SolarCity this summer, the automaker plans to seek a new round of financing to support the Gigafactory, as well as meet demand for the forthcoming Model 3, Fred Lambert of Electrek reported this week. Players converge on the Hyperloop Clean-tech visionary Elon Musk first unveiled his idea for a high-speed ground transport system called Hyperloop back in 2013. The concept — in which passengers are transported in magnet-propelled capsules at more than 750 miles per hour — was quickly dismissed by many as a pipe-dream. Musk opted not to pursue the concept himself (in all fairness, he has a lot going on). But he open-sourced his plans, allowing partners to convene and make his vision a reality. Earlier this year, three similarly-named companies — Hyperloop Technologies, Hyperloop Transportation Technologies and Hyperloop One — claimed to be inching closer. Hyperloop One was the first to complete a public test. But all three companies, along with a few others, are still in the race. In the most recent development, Hyperloop Transportation Technologies (HTT) scored a coveted partnership with German railway company Deutsche Bahn. The two firms plan to collaborate on a new “Innovation Train” that will combine Hyperloop technology with more traditional transportation methods, Jacob Kleinman of Techno Buffalo reported in July. Will it be enough to bring HTT’s technology to the head of the pack? Only time will tell. But we hope to see more collaboration, along with a healthy dose of competition, to move this groundbreaking concept forward.

Hanjin is responsible for about 7.8% of the trans-Pacific trade volume for the U.S. market, according to the letter. The South Korea-based Hanjin filed for bankruptcy protection on Wednesday, prompting terminal operators, truckers and others to stop handling the company’s cargo for fear of not getting paid. See also: Retailers ask U.S. to help resolve shipping crisis Panjiva October is a critical month for holiday shipping On the one hand, experts say bigger problems could be avoided. The South Korean government is encouraging Hyundai Merchant Marine Co. to purchase parts of Hanjin, which could resolve any shipping issues before the all-important holiday shopping season gets fully underway. However, there are no guarantees that plan will work, which could stifle sales at the most important point in the year for U.S. retailers. Among the retailers that could be most impacted by the Hanjin bankruptcy are Wal-Mart Stores Inc. WMT, -1.37%  , Target Corp. TGT, -1.54% J.C. Penney Co Inc. JCP, -3.69% and other clothing retailers that are already facing issues, from competition with e-commerce giant Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +1.99% to a shift in purchasing from “stuff” to “experiences.” “From a retail perspective I’d look beyond the ‘my box of sweaters is stuck on a boat somewhere’ and focus on the mid-term,” said Christopher Rogers, research analyst at Panjiva, a global trade data and analytics company. “While September is a busy season, October is what really matters for the holidays. Arguably that’s plenty of time for people to make alternative arrangements.” See also: TTIP is on life support—as is global trade growth Other shippers could fill the shipping void to the U.S. left by Hanjin While Rogers says the Hyundai deal can put things “back to normal by next week,” shipping rates have already jumped, “increasing retailers’ costs immediately.” There are alternatives. There are 17 shipping companies that have at least half the capacity or more of Hanjin, said Rogers. Among those that are bigger, according to shipping industry monitor Alphaliner, are COSCO Container Lines and the operator with the most share of capacity, APM-Maersk MAERSKA, +2.49% MAERSKB, +2.10% But moving quickly is most important. Retailers have some timing flexibility, according to Brandon Levey, chief executive officer at Stitch Labs, an inventory management software company. “But it’s usually a matter of weeks,” he said. “It wouldn’t be months because then you’re crossing seasons.” See also: Wal-Mart unveils its top toy list and holiday layaway launch For brands, the situation is even more risky. Money spent on merchandise that languishes on a ship or in a port can’t be recouped in sales. Not only does it have an impact now, but could impact inventory planning, according to Levey. “When money is tied up in goods that you’re not able to sell, there’s less money for future seasons,” he said. The National Retail Federation is also thinking long term. “Retailers’ main concern is that there is millions of dollars worth of merchandise that needs to be on store shelves that could be impacted by this,” said Jonathan Gold, vice president for supply chain and customs policy, in a statement about the Hanjin bankruptcy. “Retailers are working with all of their service providers to find ways to get their cargo moving to ensure that there is no or limited interruption in the supply of merchandise.” The Global Port Tracker, a report published by the NRF and Hackett Associates, forecasts that major U.S. ports will handle 1.61 million twenty-foot equivalent units, or TEUs, of cargo in September, down 0.6% year-over-year. A TEU is a measurement of a ship’s cargo capacity.

The problem was critical enough that the White House got involved. “[T]he low point was 1.2 million containers in February 2015,” said Shearman. “That was the month an agreement was reached on a new contract. The numbers then soared to 1.73 million containers—an all-time record—in March 2015 after the backlog was freed up. It took through May 2015 to really work through all of the backup.” More from MarketWatch Fast Growing Companies at Value Prices My Ride: Restoring America's First Muscle Car The Next Generation of Roads That Talk to Cars Quote References WMT -0.95 -1.37% TGT -1.12 -1.54% JCP -0.29 -3.69% AMZN +15.54 +1.99% MAERSKA +280.00 +2.49% MAERSKB +250.00 +2.10% Show all references Most Popular S&P 500, Nasdaq end at records after solid jobs report These are the 10 best and 10 worst U.S. stocks of 2017 Here’s the right way for stock-market investors to trade Trump in 2017 These jobs are getting the biggest pay raises Here are the safest airlines to fly in 2017 Tonya Garcia Tonya Garcia is a MarketWatch reporter covering retail and consumer-oriented companies.

Christopher Joseph Lucier, 28, of Ozark, was arrested and charged with making a terrorist threat, obstructing government operations and public intoxication. He is being held in the Dale County Jail on $12,000 bond. According to the arrest report, officers were called to the Wal-Mart store at around 10:40 to the report of a possible drunk driver trying to push his vehicle in the parking lot. On the way to the scene, officers learned the suspect, later identified as Lucier, was threatening to kill people with a shotgun. Lucier is accused of threatening to "kill all the n-----s" while waving a shotgun, the report states.   According to the report, Lucier refused to comply with the officers after they arrived on the scene. One officer deployed his Taser in order to take the suspect in custody. "The suspect fell backwards striking his head on the ground causing minor injury," the report stated. Lucier was then taken into custody without further incident. Officers said Lucier appeared to be under the influence of alcohol or other drugs.  About Us About Alabama Media Group Jobs at Alabama Media Group Advertise with us News In Education Frequently Asked Questions About AL.com Contact Us Online Store Already a Subscriber?

There is not a specific date set, but it will be in the next couple of weeks, Jason Bleick, local franchise owner, said. What McDonald’s did for fast food, Seva is looking at doing for the spa business, Bleick said. “Spas have typically been a high-end product, if you had the money you could go play,” Bleick explained. Seva strives to bring the spa idea to people at a different price point. The key to the Seva business model is volume, just as it is with the Walmart stores in which the spas are generally located. Seva has, so far, partnered nearly exclusively with the world’s largest retailer, Walmart, Bleick said. They do have a few stand-alone locations. “You can get the beautiful feeling at a lower price, rather than spending 60 minutes somewhere else and spending $100,” Bleick said. With thousands of customers going through the checkout lanes every day, Seva is in plain sight. Employees called “beauty ambassadors,” are offering both consultations and coupons for services as further enticement. Seva specializes in skin care and hair removal, Bleick said. “We’ll do facials, we’ll do waxing, we do eyelash extensions, we do eyebrow tinting, eyebrow shaping (and) makeup application,” Bleick added. People can go just about anywhere and get a haircut or nails done. “There’s no real places where you can do what we do at the price-point,” Bleick said. With nationwide locations, Seva writes on its website that the company “Maximizes one-stop-shop convenience and price points everyone can afford,” bringing “Beauty to the People.” Seva Beauty was founded by Vas Maniatis and was featured in a 2012 edition of Entrepreneur Magazine as a pioneer in the idea of co-branding. Normally such practices are found in the fast food industry, but Maniatis has been very successful with his salon idea. The Chicago-based company actually began life as a business called Simply Eyebrows, but in 2009 it tested operating in a Walmart in Indianapolis. Walmart executives later suggested more services be added and the partnership has grown from there to have dozens of locations across the U.S. Seva’s is closely tied to Walmart, having worked for a number of years establishing that relationship, Bleick said.

News U.S. Labor World Environment Views Culture Contact Donate To rebuild unions, lobbying and organizing must go hand in hand September 2, 2016 4:44 PM CST By Mark Gruenberg WASHINGTON – According to two of the nation’s leading labor lawyers, to win better lives and rebuild the union movement, workers must do two things at once: organize and lobby. The lawyers are Judith Scott, general counsel for the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) and Richard Griffin, general counsel for the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). They spoke at a recent symposium here on labor law. They described what is now the fastest growing movement among low wage workers, the “fight for 15 and a union,” which is being led by SEIU. Scott recalled that it started in November, 2012, with 200 fast-food workers in restaurants in New York City. They struck for the right to unionize without employer harassment. “Now it’s spread to thousands of workers in at least 30 cities,” Scott said. “And workers in six countries overseas have launched solidarity movements.” “We in the SEIU didn’t send people into small cities in Arkansas,” Scott said, “but we got calls from fast food workers there. ‘We’re on strike,’ they said. ‘What do we do now?'” The first priority of the movement, which Scott said also restored the right to strike in many locations, was not to win union recognition and collective bargaining. Instead, workers made gains through winning new legislation. The results have been dramatic: raises in minimum wages in cities and states across the U.S. For example, fast food workers in New York City and New York State won legislation raising their minimum wage to $15 an hour and the establishment by Governor Andrew Cuomo of a commission to investigate low wage workers. They did this through building political power. To illustrate the importance of low wage workers organizing into unions and fighting for political clout at the same time, Griffin cited the movement of Wal-Mart workers to unionize into the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW). The campaign has as one of its objectives the establishment of nationwide wages and hours standards to cover Wal-Mart workers. However, the UFCW has had to fight store by store. The U.S. Supreme Court several years ago barred them from a nationwide class action suit charging wage and promotion discrimination against female workers. “The organizing process has been slow and fraught with obstacles,” Griffin said. “There’s a steady stream of cases, and handling them efficiently is a challenge.” The NLRB, he continued, has convicted Wal-Mart officials at least 288 times for violating the rights of workers. But those convictions did not influence Wal-Mart to change its anti-union practices, Griffin said, because the penalties involved are so small. All Wal-Mart had to do was to shell out some back pay and post notices in its stores and warehouses informing workers of their rights. Wal-Mart continues to disregard these rights with impunity. Griffin said “the National Labor Relations Act has not necessarily been flexible enough to accommodate workers.” What’s needed is new, stronger legislation to protect workers’ rights. Such legislation has been blocked by big business and the Republicans To effectively fight back, Scott said, workers from many different industries must join together. “In the service sector of the economy,” she said, “we are looking at putting together fast food workers, retail workers, port truckers, Wal-Mart workers, warehouse workers, home health care workers, and adjunct professors.” “It’s important not to suffer from a lack of imagination,” she said. Griffin concluded “The fight for 15 and a union has the same strategy and mobilization tactics as Black Lives Matter, the environmental justice movement and the campaign for LGBT rights. “Sooner or later,” he predicted, all four movements “will have a convergence on their issues,” with all four supporting each other.

Back in the CD era, there were few executives as powerful as Best Buy's Gary Arnold. As the main music buyer for the electronics giant, he helped oversee the chain's growth from a tertiary "specialist" seller into a dominant force in music retail, moving hundreds of millions of albums to a voracious customer base. Starting in the early '90s, Best Buy was first to embrace exclusives on a national scale, poking competitors (other big box retailers like Walmart and Target) with what were then called "value adds." Not unlike what the industry is seeing today, with artists like Frank Ocean and Drake opting for a digital partnership that would shut out all others (Apple Music over Spotify, in both cases), product offerings that favor one merchant at the expense of another have a long history.  So what was the first ever music exclusive? Back in 1995, Arnold and his then boss Jeff Abrams stunned music retail when they came up with an exclusive Beatles CD interview disc as a giveaway to anyone buying the Beatles' Anthology 1 album. A bonus CD manufactured without input from the Beatles’ label, Capitol Records, was in the clear when competitors complained. The result of the exclusive offering? It was seen as a very successful promotion that helped Best Buy sell 800,000 units of the Anthology 1 package, Billboard reported at the time. Others, like longtime music industry executive Jim Urie, point to another promotion with Barbra Streisand (a bonus concert video on VHS) a decade earlier. Even more remember the Eagles' ​Long Road Out of Eden, a Walmart exclusive that got major media attention at the time.  Billboard tracked down Arnold (who left Best Buy in 2012 to start his own firm, Gary L. Arnold Consulting) to speak on how the industry has changed... and not changed. Billboard: How did the idea to have Best Buy offer a free Beatles interview CD to every customer that purchased the Beatles Anthology 1 come about? Gary Arnold: It was Best Buy trying to find a way to bring excitement to the business and to show the labels how to give extra value to the consumer. It was not about the exclusive, it was about trying to get the consumer to come in and shop more frequently. Traffic is important and we found when there is an exciting offering of differentiated product, it drove a lot of traffic to the benefit of the stores. From Beyonce to Frank Ocean, Breaking Down the Mechanics, and Politics, Behind Streaming Exclusives How many did you sell in the first week? We sold a couple hundred thousand in the first week, but it wasn’t just our promotion. It was a wonderful collection of music, including the then-unreleased “Free As A Bird” song. There were all sorts of other marketing going on around that project, including, if I remember correctly, a network television special on the album that ran over a number of nights. So customers came pouring into Best Buy and what that said to us is, if you put together a massive creative campaign, the customer would respond and everyone would benefit. Best Buy also utilized windowing with a Prince release in 1998 and a U2 DVD in 2001.  Our relationship with Prince started with Crystal Ball. Since we were both in his backyard in Minnesota, we had pursued a dialog for a long time and one day he called. He had put out Crystal Ball already through his website and now wanted it to go to retail. He provided us with the artwork we could use and we came up with a very elaborate package with a clear see-through case, and later it came out in a more traditional package. We had an exclusive window for a couple of weeks. With U2’s Elevation 2001: Live From Boston, that was a project that that they wanted out in conjunction with a tour so we had it for a short window exclusively. At that point, deluxe packaging and value-added packaging was one thing, but an exclusive window really upset our competitors. It became very clear that exclusive windows would cause a lot of negativity. I remember after that I approached them on something else and they [the U2 camp] responded by saying, "This time, could we do something that won’t start World War III?" But retail reaction didn’t stop you from pursuing exclusives? We were trying to win every day with the consumer, and one way to do that was to have differentiated project rather than just competing on price levels. If you look at the Rolling Stones, Elton John and Tom Petty projects, each of which we had exclusively for a short window, they were multiple discs each with four DVDs, but we had them priced between $19 and $29. In every case, the artists were aware of the price point and they were excited about the value created for the fan. That’s why it worked. 'Bad for the Industry': Spotify's Artist Whisperer Troy Carter Slams Exclusives, Updates Company's Subscriber Total What do you think about today's discussion of exclusives, as they relate to digital services? It makes the days of physical retail look very uncomplicated. We were very good at selling one thing to a lot of people. In today’s world, you have to figure out how to sell a concert package, a song, a stream and how to monetize each niche. You have to put on all these different hats to maximize results and profitability. There continues to be a lot of stress in the market, due to the exclusives.  How does selling a subscription to a Spotify or Tidal compare to the Best Buy's effort to get a customer in the store? It's more difficult to get the kids to go to a new site than it was to get them to go to a different [brick and mortar] retail store. No matter which store you bought the CD from, when you got home, it would play right away. Now, you have to go and learn how to get on the new site, and get a new password and then figure out how you're going to get your playlists over there. It's a much harder process to switch services. I just got accustomed to the site I am on and setting it up on all my devices and now you want me to go to another service and start all over again? I'd much rather wait until the album is available everywhere, including my service. Isn't that the old person view? I don’t know. I talk to my children who are 21 and 22 and they seem to have the same attitude on this. What experiences in the brick and mortar world translate to the digital world? I think you still have to focus on the consumer and not the competition. The consumer will tell you if you are winning and losing. Look, we did exclusives, but soon so did Walmart and Target and with deluxe packages that did great things for their stores. If you are going to participate in this area, expect to be beaten sometimes. You don’t win every game.

The job relocation will come from its invoice and accounting departments in all its 4,600 US stores, and most of the affected employees will find new customer-facing jobs, Walmart said, adding that the new jobs will include positions like working in the online pickup department or as pharmacy technicians. Walmart spokeswoman Deisha Barnett said that the company is anticipating that associates move into new roles rather than leave the company. As for the wage levels for the relocated employees, Barnett said it would depend on what new positions the employees obtain. -- BERNAMA >> Newslist Previous Top Stories Terengganu Flood Victims Number 1,473 As Of 8 AM Malaysia's Efforts In Providing Best Access For Healthcare Receives Recognition Tan Sri Shahrir Abdul Samad Appointed As New Chairman Of Felda Other News Headlines Ongkili Is PBS Acting President With Immediate Effect- politic Mohd Isa's FGV Chairmanship Ensures Continuity: Zakaria- business Kelantan Secure Sponsorships For M-League Action This Season- sports Agrotainment Concept Main Draw Of MAHA 2016- features Thailand Pick Rexy Mainaky As National Team Head Coach- world Most Read News FOREX: Ringgit Likely To Hover Around 4.45 Next Week 12,064 Flood Victims In Kelantan As Of 8 AM Terengganu Flood Victims Number 1,473 As Of 8 AM Home | Sitemap | Contact Us | General | Politics | Business | Sports | Features | World | Full News List | Archived News | RSS Feeds © 2017 BERNAMA.

On July 7, the two women visited the Walmart on Route 22 in West Watchung. They swiped multiple credit cards that they were not authorized to use, purchasing items totaling $99.92 before leaving the store and driving away in a white SUV. NJ couple stole woman's identity to buy $86K Mercedes, authorities say “They look pretty happy in those pics,” state police said on Facebook. “With your help, we will see if they smile for mug shots.” Police are asking anyone who may recognize them, or who has information on the incident, to contact Det. Brian Emerick of the Watchung Police Department at 908-756-3663, ext. 114 or email at bemerick@watchungpd.com. Tips can also be submitted anonymously.

Agriculture is the economic lifeblood of Morrill County. “That is all we have here,” said Jeff Metz, a rancher and county commissioner. “We’re never going to get a large Wal-Mart or a Kawasaki. We’re ag. And we want to tell everybody in this state or anybody that passes through, livestock is very important to us.” That’s why in 2005 Metz asked county leaders to have Morrill designated as Nebraska’s first livestock friendly county through a program created by the Legislature two years earlier. Metz said he likes to think the designation has helped influence people to work and do business in the county, but he can’t point to a direct link. It’s a point that researchers from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and Oklahoma State University attempted to address in a recently published study that found on average counties with the designation have gained more cattle farms and lost fewer hog farms than counties without it. The study doesn’t prove the designation leads to livestock expansion, said UNL agricultural economics professor Azzeddine Azzam, one of four authors, but it does show counties with the designation are doing better than their counterparts. “We’re not studying cause and effect,” Azzam said. Rather “it seems like those that have the designation have experienced in the case of cattle larger farm numbers and in the case of hogs it slowed down the exit of farms.” Nebraska Farmers Union President John Hansen criticized both the program and the study saying it proved nothing. Hansen said there are no tangible benefits to the designation and counties that have sought it already were livestock-centric. “We have some serious concerns and issues with the Nebraska Department of Agriculture relative to how they have been administering the livestock friendly counties programs,” Hansen said. He went on to say the department has shown a bias toward massive, corporate-owned facilities over local control. Mat Habrock, assistant director of the state Ag Department, responded that the designation is entirely voluntary. “Local control is still very much tied into this, because it is the county’s decision to go through the review process,” Habrock said. The state Ag Department reviewed the professor's study before it was recently published in the Online Journal of Rural Research & Policy. The major benefit of the designation is bragging rights. The designation is used on signage and marketing sites within the livestock industry. “It’s a willingness from the county to show that they’re open for business, and they recognize the important role animal agriculture can play,” Habrock said. Habrock added that many factors account for livestock expansion and that there are counties friendly to agriculture that have not sought the designation. The study based its findings on the number of cattle and hog farms reported in each of Nebraska’s 93 counties in the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s census in 2002, 2007 and 2012. The study did not look at the number of animals or the size of the farms. Get breaking news sent instantly to your inbox Sign Up!

For cattle, before 2007 nearly all counties lost farms. But from 2007 to 2012 16 of the 21 counties with livestock friendly designations reported more farms. Counties with the designation increased their overall cattle farm numbers by 12 percent, while those not designated saw increases of 8 percent. One surprising finding was a negative effect on cattle farms in counties in the program the longest. Morrill County, for example, lost 11 cattle farms from 2007 to 2012. “One possible explanation for this would be that those counties that joined early have other unexplained factors leading to the decrease in cattle numbers. These factors may have been one reason that led to the county joining the program,” the paper says. For hog farms from 2007 to 2012, counties with the designation saw a 16 percent drop, meanwhile counties without it lost 38 percent of farms, the study shows. To earn a livestock friendly designation, a county must hold a public hearing and adopt a declaration acknowledging the importance of livestock to the well-being of the county and provide the state copies of its livestock zoning requirements, among other things. To date, 37 counties have received the designation. The designation doesn’t guarantee livestock expansion will happen without controversy. In Gage County, designated livestock friendly in 2012, the board of supervisors this summer rejected a special use permit for a poultry farm that would have housed 150,000 birds east of Cortland. Board members said too many variables came with the project related to manure storage and disposal of dead chickens. Habrock said the state Ag Department is watching the situation but has not yet taken a position on whether it will affect the county’s livestock friendly designation. Nebraska Farm Bureau President Steve Nelson said the study demonstrates the value of embracing livestock as an economic development tool. “Nebraska Farm Bureau was very supportive of the legislation that created the Livestock Friendly County program and we’ve had numerous County Farm Bureaus that have worked with their local elected leaders to secure the Livestock Friendly designation for their county,” Nelson said. “It’s our hope the study will encourage additional counties to give consideration to the program.” Reach the writer at 402-473-7304 or nbergin@journalstar.com.  On Twitter @ljsbergin.

By Ashley Redmond September 2, 2016 Krista Kennell / Shutterstock.com If you are wondering where to put your money, it’s never a bad idea to comb through Warren Buffett’s investments. This year, the famed investor has made some changes to his portfolio at Berkshire Hathaway. Most notable is his purchase of Apple stock, since Buffett has famously avoided tech stocks in the past. But there are other surprises as well. Buffett’s investments in Coca-Cola and Walmart are well-known, but read on to find out where else the Oracle of Omaha is placing his bets. Perhaps these picks will offer you guidance to building your own portfolio. saiko3p / Shutterstock.com Apple Berkshire Hathaway’s portfolio includes two tech stocks: IBM and Apple, a technology company that designs, develops and sells electronics and computer software. Apple is widely known for products such as Mac computers and iPhones. Berkshire Hathaway’s original Apple investment, which surprised many investors, came in the first quarter of 2016. Berkshire held 9.81 million Apple shares worth $1.07 billion as of March 31, according to Reuters. When news broke about the Berkshire stake, shares of Apple rose 3.7 percent, closing at $93.88. It is worth noting that Buffett did not select the stock. Instead, two of his investment managers, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, made the purchase, according to a report in the the Wall Street Journal. “Apple has a strong brand, independent management and tremendous cash flow,” said Ryder Taff, portfolio manager at New Perspectives, a money management firm based in Ridgeland, Miss. Although Buffett himself might not have thought of this purchase, it fits well with his style. As of Aug. 22, Apple was trading at $108.44, up $17.92 per share since Berkshire Hathaway’s investment. Apple has not made any big changes in recent months, but the company did create some buzz in June when it previewed the iOS 10 for iPhones. In addition, a major announcement is planned for Sept. 7, when Apple is expected to unveil a new version of the iPhone and an updated Apple Watch. © Kinder Morgan / © Kinder Morgan Kinder Morgan In the fourth quarter of 2015, Berkshire Hathaway purchased 26.53 million shares of Kinder Morgan, the largest energy infrastructure company in North America. At the end of last year, the shares were worth roughly $395.9 million, according to information from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Last year, Kinder Morgan was caught in the marketwide energy slump, with shares falling 65 percent, according to Bloomberg. It’s not clear if Buffett pulled the trigger on this investment or if one of his investment managers made the decision. But the investment echoes Buffett’s value-investing strategy of buying stocks from good companies at less than their intrinsic value. And for now, that strategy appears to have paid off. As of Dec. 31, 2015, the stock was trading at $14.92. On Aug. 22 of this year, the stock was trading at $22.12. It’s up nearly 50 percent since Berkshire Hathaway’s investment. Kinder Morgan intends to increase its dividend this year to 50 cents per share. That is significantly higher than at the end of the fourth quarter in 2015, when the company slashed its dividend to 12.5 cents a share. Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com Phillips 66 Berkshire Hathaway picked up an additional $1 billion worth of stock in energy company Phillips 66. Berkshire Hathaway now owns roughly 14.1 percent of the oil refiner, according to Reuters. Phillips 66 has not had a great year. On Dec. 3, 2015, it was trading at $81.80. By late August, it was trading around $76 per share. Nobody has confirmed who decided to pile up on Phillips stock — it might have been Buffett, but it also might have been Weschler or Combs. However, similar to Kinder Morgan, the decision to buy this stock is in line with Buffett’s value-investing strategy, making it an ideal pick for Buffett. Phillips 66 is Buffett’s seventh-highest paying dividend stock, according to Forbes. In May, the company raised its quarterly dividend 12.5 percent to 63 cents per share.

Berkshire Hathaway increased shares of Deere, the farm equipment maker widely known for manufacturing the famous green-and-yellow tractors. According to a regulatory filing, by the end of 2015, Buffett’s company upped its stake to 22.8 million shares. Recent numbers show Berkshire Hathaway owning 7.2 percent of the company, at a total worth of more than $1.9 billion. It is not known who made the decision to buy more shares of this stock. “Buffett loves a good brand, and John Deere is a great one. Driving through rural America, nothing is more recognizable than the green bodies and yellow wheels of John Deere equipment,” Taff said. As of Aug. 22, the stock was trading at a yearly high of $87.96. At the end of 2015, it was trading at $76.26. © Liberty Global / © Liberty Global Liberty Global Liberty Global is one of the world’s largest cable providers and has a stronghold in Europe. The company has had a rough year, however. At the end of 2015, it was trading at $37.66. Four days after the Brexit vote was announced, the stock dropped to $26.99. As of Aug. 22, it had crept back up to $31.88. In the past year, Berkshire Hathaway has increased its stake in Liberty Global, according to Forbes. Berkshire Hathaway’s portfolio remains full of Liberty Global stock, including Liberty Media Group and Liberty Sirius XM Group. According to Forbes, Buffett’s love affair with this company might be due to its successful CEO, John Malone. Buffett once said of great CEOs, “It’s almost impossible to overpay the truly extraordinary CEO … but the species is rare.” It remains unclear who is managing Liberty stock at Berkshire Hathaway. Overall, Liberty Global shows no signs of slowing down. The company recently signed an original-content pact with British production group All3Media. Read: The Key Essentials to Long-Term Investing Strategies Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com Wells Fargo Berkshire Hathaway owns so much Wells Fargo stock — more than 479 million shares worth more than $23 billion — that it has applied to the Federal Reserve for approval to own more than 10 percent of the company, according to Bloomberg. Current rules allow a 10 percent maximum ownership in the company. The stock has had a rough year. At the end of 2015, it was trading at $54.36. As of Aug. 22 it was sitting at $48.63. Still, last spring Wells Fargo announced a dividend increase of 1 percent. Buffett hasn’t commented recently on why he likes this stock, but a 2009 Fortune interview provides some insight. In that interview, he said, “But the real insight you get about a banker is how they bank. You’ve got to see what they do and what they don’t do. Their speeches don’t make any difference. It’s what they do and what they don’t do. And what Wells didn’t do is what defines their greatness.” Buffett was responsible for buying Berkshire’s first shares of Wells Fargo.

The stock market ended the Thursday affair on a flat note as the S&P 500 clawed back the bulk of today's loss. Trading conditions continued to be on the lighter side as market participants wind down recent vacation schedules and look ahead to tomorrow's Employment Situation Report for August.Equity indices sputtered at the start of the session as a string of weaker-than-expected economic data weighed on the broader market. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 18.42 points, or 0.1%, higher at 18,419.30. The Nasdaq Composite Index ended with a gain of 13.99 points, or 0.3%, at 5,227.21, benefiting from some buying in tech shares. The S&P 500 index lost 0.09 points, or less than 0.1%, to close at 2,170.86, but well off the session low. A 2% rise by Wal-Mart Stores and a 1.8% rise by Nike led blue-chip gainers. American Express and Goldman Sachs were the biggest laggards in the gauge. Dow component Wal-Mart's shares rose after The Wall Street Journal reported that the retail giant planned to eliminate 7,000 jobs. Among economic data expected for the day, stocks took a sharp step lower after a key data point; The Institute for Supply Management manufacturing index in August fell to 49.4% from 52.6% last month. A reading below 50% signals contraction. A similar but less influential gauge, the Markit manufacturing purchasing managers index, fell to 52 from 52.9% in July. Crude oil futures closed down more than 3% on Thursday, 01 September 2016 carving out another three-week low, as doubts over the potential for a crude-production freeze persisted and data showing a contraction in the U.S. manufacturing activity contributed to expectations of weaker energy demand. Prices for natural gas, meanwhile, dropped over 3% after an increase in weekly U.S. supplies of the commodity came in a bit higher than expected. October West Texas Intermediate crude fell by $1.54, or 3.5%, to settle at $43.16 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, with prices down a fourth-straight session. November Brent crude on London's ICE Futures exchange ended at $45.45 a barrel, down $1.44, or 3.1%. Gold futures rebounded from two-month lows on Thursday, 01 September 2016 to finish higher, after data showing a fall in U.S. manufacturing activity pressured the dollar and potentially gave the Federal Reserve a little less reason to boost interest rates at a meeting this month. Traders will now look ahead to Friday's monthly U.S. jobs report for further clues on the central bank's plans for interest rates. December gold rose $5.70, or 0.4%, to settle at $1,317.10 an ounce. December silver rose 23.6 cents, or 1.3%, to $18.943 an ounce. For the month of August, however, silver prices declined 8.1%, based on the most-active contract. Gold fell as the dollar moved lower against its chief rivals. The ICE U.S. Dollar Index, a measure of the greenback against a basket of six rival currencies, was down 0.3% as gold futures settled. Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen had reiterated at the Jackson Hole, Wyo. economic summit last week that any decision on rates would be depended on the degree to which incoming data continues to confirm the Fed policy committee's outlook. The market will get further clues on that front from data set for release Friday. The Labor Department is expected to say the world's largest economy added 185,000 jobs in August; its report includes government hiring. Treasuries ended on a mixed note with the short end of the curve demonstrating relative strength. The yield on the 2-yr note ended lower by three basis points (0.78%) while the yield on the 30-yr bond settled flat at 2.23%. For its part, the yield on the benchmark 10-yr note slipped one basis point to 1.57% Today's participation was below the recent average as fewer than 805 million shares changed hands on the NYSE floor. Tomorrow's economic data will include the Employment Situation Report for August (consensus 180k) and the Trade Balance for July (consensus -$43.0 billion), which will each cross the wires at 8:30 ET. Separately, Factory Orders for July (consensus +2.0%) will be released at 10:00 ET.

Short term: Prices are stalling. Intermediate term: Prices are ranging. The projected upper bound is: 74.43. The projected lower bound is: 71.29. The projected closing price is: 72.86. Candlesticks A big white candle occurred. This is generally considered bullish, as prices closed significantly higher than they opened. If the candle appears when prices are “low,” it may be the first sign of a bottom. If it occurs when prices are rebounding off of a support area (e.g., a moving average, trendline, or retracement level), the long white candle adds credibility to the support. Similarly, if the candle appears during a breakout above a resistance area, the long white candle adds credibility to the breakout. During the past 10 bars, there have been 3 white candles and 7 black candles for a net of 4 black candles. During the past 50 bars, there have been 25 white candles and 25 black candles. Momentum Indicators Momentum is a general term used to describe the speed at which prices move over a given time period. Generally, changes in momentum tend to lead to changes in prices. This expert shows the current values of four popular momentum indicators. Stochastic Oscillator One method of interpreting the Stochastic Oscillator is looking for overbought areas (above 80) and oversold areas (below 20). The Stochastic Oscillator is 52.9945. This is not an overbought or oversold reading. The last signal was a buy 1 period(s) ago. Relative Strength Index (RSI) The RSI shows overbought (above 70) and oversold (below 30) areas. The current value of the RSI is 52.36. This is not a topping or bottoming area. A buy or sell signal is generated when the RSI moves out of an overbought/oversold area. The last signal was a sell 37 period(s) ago. Commodity Channel Index (CCI) The CCI shows overbought (above 100) and oversold (below -100) areas. The current value of the CCI is -0. This is not a topping or bottoming area. The last signal was a buy 1 period(s) ago. MACD The Moving Average Convergence/Divergence indicator (MACD) gives signals when it crosses its 9 period signal line. The last signal was a sell 13 period(s) ago. Rex Takasugi – TD Profile WAL-MART STORES closed up 1.400 at 72.840. Volume was 15% above average (neutral) and Bollinger Bands were 2% wider than normal. Open High Low Close Volume___ 71.590 72.860 71.420 72.840 2,769,284 Technical Outlook Short Term: Neutral Intermediate Term: Bearish Long Term: Bullish Moving Averages: 10-period 50-period 200-period Close: 71.91 73.03 67.68 Volatility: 20 14 24 Volume: 2,695,847 2,250,213 2,985,231 Short-term traders should pay closer attention to buy/sell arrows while intermediate/long-term traders should place greater emphasis on the Bullish or Bearish trend reflected in the lower ribbon. Summary WAL-MART STORES is currently 7.6% above its 200-period moving average and is in an downward trend. Volatility is extremely high when compared to the average volatility over the last 10 periods. There is a good possibility that volatility will decrease and prices will stabilize in the near term. Our volume indicators reflect volume flowing into and out of WMT.N at a relatively equal pace (neutral). Our trend forecasting oscillators are currently bearish on WMT.N and have had this outlook for the last 20 periods.   news, NYSE, NYSE:WMT, outlook, shayne heffernan, trading, Wal-Mart Stores Wal-Mart Stores (NYSE:WMT) Prices to Stabilize in the near term added by HEFFX Australia on September 2, 2016 View all posts by HEFFX Australia → The following two tabs change content below.

Police say she did it using pre-paid credit cards. Detectives have seen this type of scheme before but they were surprised when they heard just how much money she had stolen. Marissa McMiller, 26, worked at the Walmart in Maplewood. According to police, from April to July of 2016, McMiller issued more than 100 Walmart pre-paid credit cards without paying for them. She had friends and family members come up to the register they were bringing pre-paid credit cards up to her little cards that you could put any type of amount on them. They would pay her anywhere between one to $5f depending on the cost of the card and she would load a value between $50 to $500 on them. Maplewood Ddetective David Brown says in a matter of four months McMiller rang out over $148,000. Brown says this isn`t the first time people have tried this scam. "People have definitely done this before this isn`t the first time this is probably the first time for this amount this isn`t the first time walmart has had it and retailers deal with it almost on a daily basis but at this total this is the largest we have had here before," said Brown. He explains that when you buy a Walmart pre-paid credit card the transaction starts in Missouri then is transferred to Arkansas then back to Missouri. Because it crosses state lines, it becomes a federal case. Brown says McMiller initially started this because she was told by friends and other people no one would notice it. Walmart has so much going on there was no way she would be caught. Obviously that didn`t end up being true. McMiller has been indicted by the U.S. prosecutor on three counts of wire fraud. Brown says there are 16 to 20 other people who were involved in this scheme. They were the ones buying the cards from McMiller. They will also face charges.

Home Sports News Business Opinion A&E Blogs Life Weather Photos Videos Homes Jobs × NewsOK Log In Close Walmart to open employee academy Friday in Broken Arrow By Samuel Hardiman Tulsa World samuel.hardiman@tulsaworld.com Published: September 2, 2016 12:00 AM CDT 0 shares facebook twitter pinterest email comments × Another step in Walmart's worldwide push to be more customer friendly and boost employee retention touches Broken Arrow on Friday. The mega-retailer will open an employee academy at the 3900 E Hillside Drive location. It will be the eighth such academy in the nation of about 200 planned to open by the end of 2017, according to a company news release. It may not seem like much, but it's another sign of Walmart's investment in itself. An internal investment For most of its existence, the company has been dominant because of its economies of scale. As other competitors have gone upscale and Amazon has gained market share, Walmart has embarked on a rash of internal investment. It raised wages companywide early in 2016. Some Tulsa employees got a bump from just above minimum wage to about $10 an hour. Walmart employs more than 30,000 people in the state. The new employee academy will be part classroom and part retail store, the release said. Carol Johnston, senior vice president of Walmart operations for the south-central division, said in a news release, “Skills training increases productivity, confidence and knowledge, which leads to greater job satisfaction, personal and professional growth, and helps make working at Walmart a smart career choice.” Subscribe to NewsOK's Business Headlines Stay up to date with business news in Oklahoma and around the country.

As time passes, videotapes lose their magnetic signal. The sharpness, quality and color deteriorate. Worst of all, the tape grows brittle and breaks as it’s played. To preserve the content of your videotapes, digitizing them is a must. Here are three services that make it simple to modernize your old video collection. Costco offers a digital transfer service through its Photo Center. You can transfer several types of videotapes to DVDs including VHS and S-VHS, Beta, VHS-C, Hi8, Digital 8, 8mm and MiniDV. The service includes two personalized DVDs with intelligent chapters, personalized themes and custom music. Each transfer begins at $19.99 and each DVD can hold up to two hours of video. If the footage on your tape exceeds the two-hour limit, the content will be split onto two DVDs and you’ll be charged as if you’d placed two separate orders. You can place your order using Costco’s website and drop off your tapes at your local store. When your DVDs are ready, simply pick them up and take them back home to enjoy. Just make sure the footage you provide them is not copyrighted material. Every transfer you make also comes with your own private online account at no extra cost as long as you remain an active user. This online account lets you view your transferred videos from any computer or device. To keep your account active, you must view or share videos at least once per year. Costco’s digital transfer service is not limited to videotapes. You can also transfer film reels, 35mm slides, photo prints and memory cards to DVDs. Go here (http://bit.ly/2c0H3eE) to learn more about Costco Photo Center’s services. Walgreens is another retail location that offers a digital transfer service. With Walgreens Photo, you can transfer videotapes, movie films, HD videos and photographs onto DVDs. The pricing for Walgreen’s service is complex. DVDs cost $24.99 per videotape, plus an additional $9.99 for the DVD itself. If you’d prefer to have the final footage in Blu-ray format, the cost is $20. Movie films cost $19.99 for 50 feet of film, plus $9.99 per DVD and are only accepted in 8mm, Super 8 and 16mm formats. Walgreens also offers cloud storage for a monthly fee of $4.99. This service allows you to share or watch your films with anyone, anywhere, at any time. If you’re on the fence about whether or not the cloud is worth it, your first order includes a one-month free trial. Go here (http://bit.ly/2ceUUP9) to learn more about Walgreen’s Photo. Wal-Mart also offers a DVD transfer service. Videotapes, movie film, photographs and slides, and digital media can all be transferred to DVD. Like Costco, Wal-Mart places a two-hour limit per DVD. The cost is $24.96 to transfer one VHS tape, which makes it the more expensive option. However, transferring movie film is cheaper at Wal-Mart than it is at Walgreens. The first 100 feet of film costs $24.96, and you’ll be charged $.20 per foot thereafter. Additional DVDs cost under $9.96 and additional Blu-rays cost $13.96. If you’re still not ready to part with your old VHS tapes, Wal-Mart also offers a special service to repair any that are damaged. This service costs $19.96. Go here (http://bit.ly/2c8NM3h) to compare Wal-Mart’s transfer services. If handing over your private tapes makes you nervous, transfer them to DVD yourself. To do this, you’ll need a DVD recorder and VCR combo. This device features 1080p up-conversion and two-way dubbing. This way, you are able to transfer from VHS tapes to DVDs and vice versa. Another advantage to this method is that it can record up to six hours of footage. It’s also equipped with an HDMI output. The advantage to purchasing your own DVD Recorder and VCR Combo is that it’s actually the cheapest option if you need to transfer your entire VHS library. You can also share it with friends and family members. It’s easier to use than you might think. Just power the recorder on, insert your VHS tape into the VCR slot and insert a blank DVD-R into the DVD tray. Press “record” and your footage will begin transferring. When the transfer is complete, press “play” on the DVD player to confirm everything was transferred properly. Once you’ve brought your video library into the 21st century, don’t stop there. Go here (http://bit.ly/2bCgCI5) for three ways to modernize your old slides and photos.

"While the situation is still developing, the prospect of harm is significant and apparent," Sandra Kennedy, president of the Retail Industry Leaders Association, wrote in a letter to the Department of Commerce and the Federal Maritime Commission. Hanjin's recent bankruptcy filing "presents an enormous challenge to U.S. shippers," she said, and "could have a substantial impact on consumers and the economy at large." Hanjin handles about 7.8% of the trans-Pacific trade volume for the U.S. market, her letter said. Since Hanjin filed for bankruptcy protection in a Seoul court Wednesday, terminal operators, ports, cargo handlers, truckers and others have refused to handle its cargo, not knowing if they'll get paid. That is causing chaos at U.S. ports and beyond, said shippers, importers and freight forwarders. U.S.-bound cargo has been delayed at the point of origin; cargo-laden Hanjin ships are unable to get into U.S. ports. Already delivered cargo sits unhandled, clogging ports and occupying containers needed elsewhere. A number of Hanjin ships have been barred from shipping out cargo from the main port of Busan, South Korea, and vessels have been turned away from ports in the U.S., China, Canada, Spain and elsewhere. Because Hanjin is part of an alliance of six shipping companies, the problems are even more widespread. Brokers in Asia said about 540,000 containers are expected to face delays in deliveries. Those delays could range from a few days to more than a month, according to one. As capacity tightened overnight during such a busy time, shipping rates soared. Cargo owners said rates from Busan, Korea, to Los Angeles had risen by $600 per container by Thursday from $1,700 four days earlier. Brokers said freight rates likely would continue to rise in coming days as cargo owners are trying to get their goods from stranded ships and are willing to pay a premium. One U.S. importer said he was getting rate quotes of $2,000 a container, compared with $700 before the Hanjin news. This can only aggravate problems for retailers grappling with the challenges and high costs of e-commerce and at a crucial time. Those most likely to be affected include Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Target Corp., J.C. Penney Co. and clothing retailers. A Home Depot Inc. spokesman said Hanjin isn't its only carrier so it doesn't expect a material impact. The company is working through contingency plans, he said. A Target spokeswoman said the retailer is watching development closely and assessing the situation. Marilee McInnis, a spokeswoman for Wal-Mart, said, "Right now, we are waiting to hear the final determination on bankruptcy proceedings and the implications to their current assets before we will be able to assess any impact." The $25 billion U.S. toy industry has been sweating the Hanjin news, as it is stocking up for the holiday season, when about half its annual sales are made. Jeff Bergmann, managing director of the Toy Shippers Association, said his customers are fortunate that only about 20 containers are on Hanjin or affiliated vessels. They've been told their freight will be delivered to the ports, but from there, "nobody knows," Mr. Bergmann said. Beyond that, the general concern is how long the turmoil will last. "The ripple effect could be tremendous," Mr. Bergmann said. Jessica Dankert, senior director at the Retail Industry Leaders Association, said the congestion is coming during one of the worse possible times for retailers as they stock up before the critical holiday-shopping season. "These concerns would be trouble at any time, but this is a particularly bad time for it to happen." She said retailers are considering contingency plans that include using other carriers and working to get their cargo released. Reclaiming cargo won't be easy. Cargo owners may have to wait for months to get their cargo off Hanjin ships, analysts said. "In 2001, Cho Yang, a much smaller Korean carrier, went bust and it took six months before a mere 200 containers, handled by a single freight forwarder, could be taken off to ports," said Lars Jensen of Copenhagen-based SeaIntelligence Consulting. "This is at a much bigger scale so I would not be surprised if scores of boxes on stranded Hanjin vessels ever actually make it to their destination." Another issue is the crews. Hanjin ships carry crews of 15 to 25 sailors, and with the vessels unable to call at ports, the sailors could be stranded at sea for weeks or longer. "They have food and water for a couple of weeks," said Basil Karatzas of New York-based Karatzas Marine Advisors & Co. "Beyond that, things may become very difficult because suppliers will no longer extend credit to Hanjin and everything must be paid in cash." Mr. Jensen said Hanjin quickly must file for bankruptcy protection in Europe and the U.S. to keep its ships moving. Hanjin has secured an injunction protecting its ships against seizure by creditors in Korea and is seeking a similar injunction for protection in ports abroad. "They got the injunction in Korea, but most of their ships are out at sea or at foreign ports. Ship seizures will continue and increase around the world if there is no bankruptcy protection." Mr. Jensen said. "But sorting out such legal matters at various jurisdictions is complicated, as Hanjin has no control on how fast foreign courts will examine its case."

Hanjin Shipping is South Korea's largest sea container-shipping firm and the world's seventh-biggest, with a 2.9 per cent market share. So its woes threaten to derail the supply chains of global companies that need to send goods well in advance of the year's biggest shopping season. TVs, cars and sneakers sail about 10 days to reach Los Angeles from Asia, while they could take as many as 30 days to Rotterdam. Hanjin Shipping owns 59 of the 132 container and bulk ships in its fleet. "Ports will not have these vessels because they are worried port and other fees won't be paid," said Rahul Kapoor, a Singapore-based director at Drewry Maritime Services Pvt. "This is going to play out for the next few weeks." For US retailers, the situation brings fresh concerns about the holiday shopping season. The chains are working to minimize delivery disruptions from cargo waiting to depart Asia, traveling on the ocean or arriving at ports, said Jonathan Gold, vice president for supply chain and customs policy at the National Retail Federation trade group. "Retailers' main concern is that there is millions of dollars worth of merchandise that needs to be on store shelves that could be impacted by this," Mr Gold said. "We need all parties to work together to find solutions to move this cargo so it does not have a broader impact on the economy." Major US ports are forecast to handle 1.61 million 20- foot equivalent units this month, down 0.6 per cent from the same month last year, according to the Washington-based trade organization. Another group, the Retail Industry Leaders Association (RILA), urged US Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker and Federal Maritime Commission Chairman Mario Cordero to step in. "While the situation is still developing, the prospect of harm is significant and apparent," RILA President Sandy Kennedy said in a statement. "We urge that Department of Commerce and the Federal Maritime Commission work together with all stakeholders, including ports, cargo handlers and the South Korean government, to resolve the immediate disruption and mitigate the harms posed by the current situation." "The impact on importers and exporters is having a ripple effect throughout the global supply chain," said Kennedy. LG Electronics is trying to find new carriers for its goods, the world's second-largest manufacturer of televisions said. Shipments through Hanjin account for between 15 per cent and 20 per cent of LG's deliveries to America. Hyundai Merchant Marine Co, the nation's second-biggest container line, stepped in, saying it plans to add 13 more vessels to ease the squeeze. Wal-Mart Stores Inc, the world's largest retailer, said it was too early to see what effect the Hanjin situation will have. "We are waiting to hear the final determination on bankruptcy proceedings and the implications to their current assets before we will be able to assess any impact," said Marilee McInnis, a spokeswoman for Wal-Mart. On Thursday (Sept 1), the Seoul Central District Court accepted the receivership application Hanjin made Aug. 31. A revival plan must be submitted by Nov 25, said the court, which also named the company's Chief Executive Officer Seok Tae Soo as the manager. Three of Hanjin's vessels were stuck off the Los Angeles-Long Beach port complex, while one was stranded near the Port of Prince Rupert in British Columbia, Canada. Workers in the Korean port of Busan refused to work on a ship because the company hasn't paid dues, forcing the cancellation of a berthing. Another was seized in Singapore late on Monday. About 10 more were impounded at Chinese ports, including Tianjin and Shanghai, for failing to pay service providers, the Korea International Trade Association said. "The company is internally looking into measures in case our cargo gets stranded while it's being shipped," LG said in the e-mail in a response to a Bloomberg query. Hanjin Shipping's local-currency notes due June 2017 tumbled to 13.4 per cent of face value as of 3:29 pm in Seoul, according to Korea Exchange prices, after fetching 90 per cent in March. Trading in its shares were suspended after a 24 per cent plunge on Tuesday to their lowest level since December 2009. About 70 per cent of South Korea's overseas shipments is through sea, of which Hanjin Shipping accounts for about 6 per cent, according to Cheong Seung Il, a trade ministry official. While the government doesn't expect a large impact on exports, there could still be some issues with machinery and textiles shipped via Hanjin, he said. "Some of their clients would be worried about getting their cargo if the vessels can't enter ports," said Shin Ji Yoon, an analyst at KTB Investment & Securities Co. in Seoul. Hyundai Merchant plans to add four vessels to the US, starting Sept 9, and nine on Europe routes later this month. Japanese shipping companies Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha and Nippon Yusen KK said they are working to limit delays to clients' cargo. Freight charges from South Korea surged about 50 per cent after Hanjin Shipping filed for court receivership on Wednesday, Korea Economic Daily reported, citing shipping industry officials it didn't identify. The fees on Hanjin's main shipping route between Busan and Los Angeles have jumped 55 per cent to US$1,700 per 40-foot equivalent box from US$1,100, it said. Hanjin Shipping filed for court protection Wednesday after lenders rejected its restructuring proposal, scuttling revival efforts by the firm that's been trying to reschedule debt under a voluntary creditor-led program since May. Hanjin's woes reflect those of an industry that's been operating at a loss since the end of 2015, and set to lose about US$5 billion this year amid an oversupply of vessels, according to Drewry. The possibility of a liquidation can't be ruled out, though a court will determine the fate of Hanjin Shipping, said Yim Jong Yong, chairman of South Korea's Financial Services Commission, in comments e-mailed by the regulator. Hanjin Shipping is part of Hanjin Group, which also owns Korean Air Lines Co, the world's third-largest cargo airline. Korean Air loaned funds to Hanjin Shipping and bought shares in the container line in 2014 to become the biggest shareholder with 33 per cent. The group, which also counts airport services, logistics and mineral water among its businesses, is headed by Chairman Cho Yang Ho.

See Offers Business Posted September 3, 2016 Updated September 3, 2016 increase font size Sanford rug manufacturer is hanging by a thread Flemish Master Weavers says it will have to cease manufacturing unless it gets approval to avoid tariffs on imported yarn. By J. Craig Anderson Staff Writer Follow on Twitter Email Writer 207-791-6390 Share Comment Read Article 1 of 0 A major rug manufacturer in Sanford says it is poised to either expand or collapse depending on the outcome of its pending request for free trade status to import yarn without paying tariffs. Flemish Master Weavers, which employs about 130 people in Maine, is trying to tap into a little-used federal program that would allow it to avoid duty payments of 8 percent to 9 percent on the polyester and polypropylene fibers it imports from Turkey to make its Oriental-style rugs. The company said it is caught between U.S. competitors that pay no tariffs because they produce their own yarn, and increasingly large overseas competitors that can undercut prices with lower labor costs. However, it faces an uphill battle in its quest for trade zone status because of objections from within the U.S. textile industry. If it succeeds, the company plans a major expansion of its 210,000-square-foot manufacturing facility, President Johan Moulin said. If its free trade status is denied by the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Foreign Trade Zones Board, competitive pressures likely will force it to phase out domestic manufacturing altogether. All of the factory jobs in Sanford would be lost. “Over time, we’ll become an importing company instead of a manufacturer,” Moulin said of the 28-year-old business. “That’s what I’m afraid of.” Flemish Master Weavers is a major player in the home products industry and is one of Sanford’s largest employers. Its 11 enormous looms produce about 2.5 million square meters of rug each year, which can be purchased at retailers including Macy’s, Home Depot, Wal-Mart and Bob’s Discount Furniture. It is one of only four large rug manufacturers remaining in the United States. The problem, Moulin said, is that the company is the only U.S. rug manufacturer that lacks its own yarn-making operation. Its competitors are older companies that own such equipment, which he said would cost the company upwards of $5 million to purchase. That’s more than it can afford, meaning the only affordable way to procure yarn is to buy it overseas. But while imported yarn is taxed at 8 percent for polypropylene and 8.8 percent for polyester, fully manufactured rugs made of those materials can be imported with no tariffs. Moulin said he thinks the bizarre inconsistency is a result of some decades-old regulatory oversight, but that there is no political will to rectify it. “Nobody’s going to look at the tariff of one item in the code because of one manufacturer in Maine,” he said. COMPETITION GLOBALLY AND AT HOME There is a potential way around the problem, but it is being threatened by opposition from the U.S. textile industry. Maine has five established foreign trade zones: in Waterville, Auburn, Bangor, Madawaska and Brunswick. Such zones are specially designated areas that operate almost like duty-free shops for manufacturers that import and export products. Import duties on raw materials used in production are waived, and some export fees also can be waived. Compliance costs associated with capitalizing on their benefits have curtailed the use of Maine’s trade zones, but Moulin said the company is willing to front those costs, which include turning the manufacturing site into a Department of Homeland Security-approved import site with fencing and other security measures. Obtaining trade zone status would save the company roughly $1 million a year on its materials costs, he said. “It’s not that we are asking for an advantage or a benefit,” Moulin said. “We are just looking to level the playing field.” So Flemish Master Weavers requested an extension of Waterville’s foreign trade zone to include the Sanford operation as a “subzone,” and in July, it received preliminary approval. However, there was a problem. Three trade groups – the American Fiber Manufacturers Association, National Council of Textile Organizations and United States Industrial Fabrics Institute – jointly filed an objection to the company’s trade zone application. That objection letter could be enough to derail the company’s application, said Wayne Coleman, a consultant Moulin hired to help Flemish obtain the trade zone status. “With one objection from commerce, it can put the kibosh on the whole process,” said Coleman, president and chief operating officer of Memphis, Tennessee-based FTZ Networks Inc. In their objection, the trade groups argued that there are U.S. suppliers of plastic yarn from which Flemish Master Weavers could be buying its materials, and that those domestic suppliers could be harmed in the future by any action to avoid tariffs on foreign yarn. “Approval of this petition … would harm existing producers of the yarns in interest and also set a damaging precedent threatening broad nullification of the established import duty structure for polyester and polypropylene yarn used in U.S. production of area rugs,” it said. Moulin said the problem with that argument is that there are only a handful of domestic producers of poly yarn: boutique manufacturers that lack the production capacity to meet Flemish’s needs, and Flemish’s rug-making competitors. “First of all, they probably wouldn’t want to sell it to us to begin with,” Moulin said. If they did, he estimated the cost would be about 33 percent more than the imported Turkish yarn, even with the tariff included. Given that the company has no realistic options to domestically source its yarn and is at a disadvantage against both foreign and domestic competitors, Moulin was surprised that the industry groups turned against him. “Why are they not defending us? They should be supporting us,” he said. “We are creating jobs in the textile industry.” Writing on behalf of the three organizations opposing the trade zone application, National Council of Textile Organizations spokesman Lloyd Wood said via email that the groups would not answer specific questions because the application is still pending. He did add that the organizations believe Flemish Master Weavers’ application is inappropriate because it is for a fast-tracked summary approval intended for uncontested cases. “The American Fiber Manufacturers Association, National Council of Textile Organization and the U.S. Industrial Fabrics Institute jointly opposed the summary application in favor of examining the full range of facts required by the Foreign Trade Zones Board under its regular application procedure,” Wood said. “The company has the opportunity to refile on those standard terms.” Moulin and Coleman hope to get help from Maine’s congressional delegation. Coleman said he has a meeting scheduled for Sept. 19 with Sen. Angus King, and that he has asked Sen. Susan Collins to attend, as well. “They’re keenly aware of the stakes here,” Coleman said. Flemish Master Weavers is part of Natco Home Fashions Inc., a Rhode Island company, and has operated its rug-making business in Sanford since 1991. Natco is one of the largest companies in the home textiles industry, with manufacturing facilities in Georgia, Maine and Toronto, as well as several joint ventures in China. Central Oriental is the fashion brand for the company. In 2002, Natco purchased a majority interest in Flemish Master Weavers, which had previously operated under the name Rainbow Rugs. The company has been planning a 78,000-square-foot expansion, Moulin said, but those plans are on hold and only will be carried out if the company obtains trade zone status. Otherwise, it’s likely that Natco will slowly scale back the manufacturing side of Flemish Master Weavers and shift to a model that relies solely on imported rugs. That would mean major job losses in Sanford. “We are a prime, prime, prime example of why legislation created the foreign trade zone,” he said.

KennebunkportPatriot Why should we grant tax exemptions for foreign imports for one small firm, when competing US companies can source US-made fibers and be profitable? There is nothing regionally unique about plastics – we are not talking about Belgian wool, or Scottish mohair. I think this company’s business model may contain a major flaw. A better solution would be for a low- or no- interest loan to purchase the equipment to let this company produce its own yarn, which would increase its business operations, provide a US producer of the raw material more business, and keep money within the US. In a company with that number of employees, $5 million paid for over X years out of increased profits should be do-able. reed1v A better solution is to make wool rugs of local wool. Better product, and probably better quality. Mark Gravel Local wool? Does that even exist? reed1v Indeed it does. Maine has a thriving wool industry based on alpacas, sheep, and other furry critters. Even has a growing beef industry, but that is mostly angus moo cows. Becoming the uber upscale food supplier to the world. Mark Gravel Government subsidized alpacas? I hope not. reed1v On the hoof, its a subsidy; once in the bag its taxable. KennebunkportPatriot Probably. It may require new looms. I am not certain. mghmaine Its customers aren’t buying wool rugs. KennebunkportPatriot They certainly aren’t buying Flemish rugs. reed1v Really can not best a wool rug for durability, feel, and mold resistance. Tim Bucktoo They don’t use wool, if you can read. reed1v Yes, that is why they should convert to natural fibers. charlie s Excellent post. If this company looks at a situation like this and declares that there are only two possible outcomes, either get the exemption or go out of business, I have to agree that their business model is terrible. Mark Gravel Reading Between the Lines: There is nothing wrong with their business model. Their statement is an ultimatum. Give the tax break, or we are walking. I say good for them. mghmaine I say typical corporate extortion. Mark Gravel A business is not in business for an humanitarian effort. A business is in business to make money. When regulation and taxes makes it impossible to continue doing business in a geographical area, it is only natural they will gravitate to cheaper operating environments. A business just not uproot its operations for a few pennies, but it will when the savings is significant. This country probably has the highest corporate tax rate on the planet – 35%. It is any wonder why companies move manufacturing out of the US. The reason is clear; the solution is clear. It is that simple. mghmaine Surely you are right about corporate taxes, and about the general effects of tax policy, but it doesn’t seem on point in this case. This one company wants individual tariff relief because, it seems, it failed to invest in thread- making as all its domestic competitors did. Its trade association is against its request. In short it wants special treatment or it will go away. Mark Gravel A tariff is a tax; a tariff is policy; a tariff is tax policy. This situation is about tax policy. Midwinter Sounds like the executives of that company need a box of tissues.. “Gimme what we want or eliminate jobs…” Right.. They will only stop production of carpets if their business model is so flawed they can’t make money. RichardBroderickJr Everyone wants a special favor. . KennebunkportPatriot It sounds as though they want an easy solution. Janey04090 A small local business should get a “special favor”, after all look at all the tax breaks walmart gets? We should support local businesses. mghmaine Taxes are best when paid by others. Mark Gravel What special favor do you want? Mark Gravel Vote Trump 2016.

Low cost of living, warm climate, natural beauty, modern infrastructure and one of the world’s most intriguing cultures are just a few of the reasons why Americans have set up their retirement in Mexico. Many airports throughout Mexico offer short, direct flights to the United States, making it easy to return home or to have visitors. And, of course, it’s just over the border from the U.S. The low cost and high quality of Mexico’s healthcare system also attract many retiring Americans. With more than one million Americans living in Mexico it is clearly not a fad. Thriving Expat Communities Many traditional tourist destinations in Mexico not only welcome travellers but also cater to American retirees. Puerto Vallarta, Lake Chapala, San Miguel de Allende, Baja California, Mérida and Cancun are among the most popular with Americans. These areas provide a wide range of real estate options, from modest housing in good neighbourhoods to high-end gated communities with 24-hour security. Original Image: “Retirement” by Pug50, under CC BY 2.0, via Flickr The economies in these areas are driven by North American tourists and retirees. Most businesses have English-speaking employees, and restaurants usually have menus printed in English. Adding more familiarity, most Mexican cities have stores found in the U.S. such as Walmart and Costco. Affordable Quality Healthcare Certainly one of the largest factors for retirees to consider when moving south of the border is the availability of quality healthcare in Mexico. Many are surprised to find the healthcare system in Mexico is not only very good, it is actually world class and very affordable. Costs for common surgeries and procedures can be 25% to 50% of what is paid in the U.S. Doctors and dentists are commonly educated and trained in America and Europe, and their facilities are usually supplied with the latest equipment and technologies. In fact medical tourism in Mexico because many procedures and treatments, which have proven to be successful, are either extremely expensive or not yet approved in other countries. Original Image: “Retirement” by401(K) 2012, under CC BY-SA 2.0, via Flickr As of 2014 (more recent specific data not available), an office visit with a doctor or specialist cost approximately $35 to $50. House calls were around the same price. Lab tests clocked in at about a third of the price paid in the United States, and a CT scan cost 25% of what is paid for the procedure north of the border. An overnight stay in a private hospital room is under $100 on average, and a visit to a dentist for teeth cleaning costs around $30. Prices have risen in Mexico, but also in the U.S., so the general difference seems to be about the same. Infrastructure and Communications Most populated areas in Mexico have good cellular coverage and widely available high-speed Internet. These factors help make Mexico a popular choice for those looking to semi-retire by managing their business while sitting on a beach with a laptop. In 2013, Mexico announced plans to invest $320 billion through 2018 to improve its infrastructure and communications in an effort to establish the country as a true emerging economic leader in the 21st century.   Source: http://www.mexiconewsnetwork.com/ Mexico Travel Care Comments comments Related News Thinking of leaving the U.S.?

There was also one Sentinel and one Galvatron at the same store. Nearby Target had one Sentinel. TRU had the best find, for me anyway. As I was looking at the legacy Megazords, I picked up the last LE Dragonzord, debating if I should splurge on it, when I saw a large TR box behind it, which turned out to be a TR Blaster. I instantly put the down the Dragonzord and purchased Blaster. Additionally, I saw two Sentinels and two Galvatrons in the Transformers section before finding Blaster. concrusher792 Mini-Con Posts: 44 News Credits: 1 Joined: Mon Dec 22, 2014 1:02 pm Top Re: North Carolina Transformers sightings by CAROLINA-TF-FAN » Sat Sep 03, 2016 3:09 pm Motto: "When it comes to new figures the waiting is the hardest part." I decided to go south for my hunting today first to York, SC Walmart. They had 2 TR Blurr and 1 Hardhead. Next we went to the Rock Hill Walmart on Old York Hwy and there they were 2 full sets of wave 2 deluxe. Needless to say they only have 1 full set now. They also had 2 Sentinel Primes and 1 Galvatron. I still have not seen any TR Legends or Titan Masters in my local NC or SC stores.I did buy Alpha Trion online today for $30 with free shipping.

Brainstorm isn't out yet, for one. Not in the cases with the others, will be shipped on its own, 8 per case. For another, Walgreen's doesn't stock toys by the case like Walmart/Target/TRU/etc. A case gets opened up at a distribution center, with individual items fulfilled in the single digits for any stores where the peg for the product is empty. What each store gets is completely random. This may end up being different for Brainstorm if he gets his own endcap display like Namor and some past ML and SW Black exclusives of theirs have - in that case it's likely each location will get several of Brainstorm, alone.

Two of each of those remain. Also a few each of Clash of the TF Warriors Starscream and the white Power Surge OP. No Paralons at all, still, so I broke down and just ordered it online on their site. Same store had a couple Fort Maxes, two PMOP, a Blaster, and the Morbot/Quickshadow wave of Rescue Bots. SW's SilverHammer wrote:I-I trusted you Scotty!

Picked up a Paralon b/c of his BW Scorponok style head. There was also at least 1 TR Fort Max (may have been 2, I was more concerned with the RID Warriors) and about 3 Galvatrons. Later I went to Think Geek store at Crabtree while my friend ran some errands. I had been wondering if they would ever reduce the price of their CW Victorion sets since they were overpriced and probably did not sell well at the inflated cost of $119.99. When I went in there was one left and the price had been dropped to $59.99. That was one of the lowest prices I had seen in a while and had been wanting it for a while as well, so I splurged and pounced on it. Amazon's cheapest was $72.00, HTS still charging $99.99 and ThinkGeek.com is charging $109.99, so I think I did pretty well. concrusher792 Mini-Con Posts: 44 News Credits: 1 Joined: Mon Dec 22, 2014 1:02 pm Top Re: North Carolina Transformers sightings by ScottyP » Sat Oct 15, 2016 4:27 pm Weapon: Battle Blades 1 of each TR Wave 2 deluxe at the Walgreen's on the corner of Capital Blvd. and New Hope Church Rd in Raleigh. $19.99 each is no fun but if you only need one or all, they're there for the taking!

It’s lacking the instructions, poster, and the lil card however. Apperently those instructions are printed on some real expensive paper. I took the only one they had but they did have a couple of Onslaughts and of course if one TJ Maxx had Purplejack and the gang then others will to. I hope I can find me a Superion with Bluebolt at another TJ Maxx.

AP Images. Retailers are in crisis as cargo carrying sneakers, TVs and more products are stranded on the high seas. Hanjin Shipping, the world’s seventh-largest shipping companies based in South Korea — which operates out of ports in Long Beach, Calif. and Los Angeles — filed for bankruptcy protection in a Seoul court on Thursday, sparking fears from port operators that have responded by denying services to Hanjin vessels. Related Walmart's Jet.com Purchases ShoeBuy for $70 Million The situation affects U.S.-bound cargo being delayed at origin ports, as well as ships with cargo remaining idle and unable to enter U.S. ports. Hanjin Shipping vessel. AP Images. Hanjin’s shutdown “presents an enormous challenge to U.S. shippers,” Retail Industry Leaders Association president Kennedy said in a statement, adding that the situation “could have a substantial impact on consumers and the economy at large.” The disruption could affect supplies for retailers looking to gear up for the upcoming holiday season — and the Retail Industry Leaders Association has urged the Department of Commerce and the Federal Maritime Commission to take action on the matter. Some of the retailers affected include Walmart, Target, and J.C. Penney, Market Watch noted. “While the situation is still developing, the prospect of harm is significant and apparent,” RILA President Sandy Kennedy wrote in a letter. “We urge that Department of Commerce and the Federal Maritime Commission work together with all stakeholders, including ports, cargo handlers and the South Korean government, to resolve the immediate disruption and mitigate the harms posed by the current situation.” The fallout has been swift. So far, three of Hanjin’s vessels have been idle near L.A. and Long Beach ports, and another remains outside the Port of Prince Rupert in British Columbia, Canada, while another has been seized in Singapore, according to Bloomberg. A source tells the organization that ports have refused Hanjin ships “because they are worried port and other fees won’t be paid.” “The impact on importers and exporters is having a ripple effect throughout the global supply chain. Further, the inability to return empty containers is causing backups and interfering with chassis availability. Finally, given that Hanjin is part of a larger shipping alliance, uncertainty about its future is effecting the ability to move cargo unassociated with Hanjin. We understand that U.S. exporters are experiencing similar disruptions, as outbound cargo is turned away for the same reasons,” Kennedy explained. Total Terminals International at the Port of Long Beach, Calif. announced on its website: “Temporarily, TTI is not accepting Hanjin export.” The company filed for court receivership after bank creditors cut off financial support on Tuesday, Reuters reports. The Korea Development Bank withdrew its backing of the company, citing its nearly $5 billion debt that it incurred last year. Hanjin handles around 7.8% of the trans-Pacific trade volume for the U.S. market, according to the Retail Industry Leaders Association. — Sign up for the FN Newsletter — Business, Retail, North America, JC Penney, RILA, Target, Walmart Share This Article Email Tumblr WhatsApp LinkedIn Post navigation ← ‘Absolutely Fabulous’ Star Joanna Lumley, Hellen Mirren Donate Their Shoes For Charity Beyoncé Shows Off Festive Summer Sandal Style With Blue Ivy → Leave a Reply Cancel reply Enter your comment here...

By Harold Meyerson / Los Angeles Times September 1, 2016 Print Comments Photo Credit: Jkrincon via Flickr At a time when Democrats and their party are, by virtually every index, moving left, a powerful center-right pressure group within the liberal universe has nonetheless sprung up. Funded by billionaires and arrayed against unions, it is increasingly contesting for power in city halls and statehouses where Democrats already govern. That’s not how the charter school lobby is customarily described, I’ll allow, but it’s most certainly what it’s become. Next year, the progressive mayors of America’s two largest and overwhelmingly Democratic cities—New York’s Bill de Blasio and Los Angeles’s Eric Garcetti—will each stand for re-election. So far, the only visible challenger to Garcetti’s bid is Steve Barr, founder of the Green Dot charter schools. In New York, de Blasio’s critics have suggested that Success Academy Charter Chief Executive Eva Moskowitz would be the candidate most likely to depose the mayor, though Moskowitz has denied any interest in running. This abrupt elevation (or self-elevation) of today’s charter school entrepreneurs into tomorrow’s civic leaders may seem surprising, but it’s part of a larger pattern. In California, political action committees funded by charter school backers have become among the largest donors to centrist Democratic state legislators who not only favor expanding charters at the expense of school districts, but have also blocked some of Governor Jerry Brown’s more liberal initiatives In New York’s upcoming primary, such longtime charter supporters as Walmart heiress Alice Walton have given hundreds of thousands of dollars to a PAC seeking to unseat several Democratic legislators who’ve defended the role and budget of traditional public schools.In future decades, historians will have to grapple with how charter schools became the cause célèbre of centrist billionaires—from Walton to Bloomberg to Broad—in an age of plutocracy. The historians shouldn’t dismiss the good intentions behind the billionaires’ impulse: the desire to provide students growing up in poverty with the best education possible. But neither should they dismiss their self-exculpation in singling out the deficiencies, both real and exaggerated, of public education as the central reason for the evisceration of the middle class.  If Walmart, the corporation from which Walton derives her wealth, hadn’t compelled its suppliers to make their products abroad to reduce the price of their goods, more public school students’ parents might have the kind of stable employment and adequate incomes that foster learning-friendly upbringings. Despite the fact that our traditional ladders of mobility—decent blue-collar and service sector jobs, unions, cross-class marriages—have largely collapsed, seemingly sentient billionaires insist that teachers and their unions are the main obstacles blocking young people’s escape from poverty. The poor, or their tribunes, don’t necessarily agree. In the past couple of weeks, both the Movement for Black Lives (50 organizations active in the Black Lives Matter movement) and the NAACP passed resolutions declaring that charter schools increase segregation and leave school districts with both fewer resources and a more challenging student body. While many in minority communities dispute these views, there’s clearly some real skepticism about the merits of charterizing education among the very people it purports to help. That’s one reason the Steve Barrs and Eva Moskowitzes aren’t likely to be supplanting their mayors next year. But the charter advocates don’t need to win the high-visibility offices to prevail. By spending sufficiently to shift the composition of Democratic caucuses in legislatures, city councils or school boards to the right, they can undermine public education. Whether they mean to or not, by backing more conservative Democrats, they can also impede unrelated progressive initiatives for greater environmental protections and workers rights. And by making Democratic elected officials even more dependent on the mega-donations of the 1 percent, they make campaign-finance reform all the harder to win. In their mix of good intentions and self-serving blindness, the billionaire education reformers have much in common with some of the upper-class progressives of a century ago, another time of great wealth and pervasive poverty. Some of those progressives, in the tradition of Jane Addams, genuinely sought to diminish the economy’s structural inequities, but others focused more on the presumed moral deficiencies and lack of discipline of the poor. Whatever the merits of charters, the very rich who see them as the great equalizer are no closer to the mark than their Gilded Age predecessors who preached temperance as the answer to squalor.

By QuentinFottrell News editor It’s “iPhoneapalooza” time again. Apple unveiled details of the new iPhone 7 at an event on Wednesday. Once again, resale sites have reported a surge in trade-ins of old iPhones ahead of the announcement, but they expect trade-in prices to drop in the days after the big event. For now, though, consumers can still lock in high enough prices to break even — or earn a profit — by trading in their old gadget and upgrading to a new phone. The iPhone 7, depending on the carrier, is expected to cost around $31 a month for 24 months for a 32-gigabyte version, experts say. With most offers, it’s possible to sell an old iPhone to a resale site or online retailer for more than the cost of the new phone, although you will need to sign a two-year contract. And note that those who bought an iPhone 6S or 6S Plus last year and still have time left on their current contract would likely have to pay an early termination fee. Some 55% of people that currently own an iPhone plan to purchase the iPhone 7 by the end of the year, according to a recent survey by resale site NextWorth, which obviously has a vested interest in consumers selling their old devices. Apple said that the new iPhone 7 still comes in two screen sizes — and, therefore, compete with the larger Androids — will be water resistant (if you drop it in a pool or toilet bowl and quickly fish it out) and won’t have a headphone jack. It has a significantly improved camera. The new iPhone 7 also comes in new colors and will have a dual zoom camera lens. (Read MarketWatch’s live blog, detailing the event.) See also: This isn’t a normal iPhone upgrade — and Apple will be just fine The resale market became more lucrative for consumers with the added competition last year after Apple AAPL, +1.11%   and Wal-Mart WMT, -1.37%  entered. Resale site Glyde offers $409 for a 16-gigabye iPhone 6S (or $326 for a 6) and $447 for a larger 6S Plus (or $355 for a 6 Plus). Another such site NextWorth offers up to $350 for the 16-gigabye 6S in pristine condition (or $245 for a Plus), and up to $364 for the 6S Plus with the same memory (or $285 for a 6 Plus). And rival Gazelle offers up to $300 for the 16-gigabye iPhone 6S and up to $200 for the iPhone 6 (and a maximum of $325 for the 6S Plus). Apple and CEO Tim Cook, 5 years later(1:43) Apple CEO Tim Cook took over the reins from co-founder Steve Jobs five years ago. Since taking over, how has Apple performed? Photo: Getty Images. For gift cards only, Amazon AMZN, +1.99%   will give you around $350 for an unlocked 16-gigabyte iPhone 6S , although prices vary depending on condition and carrier, while Apple will give you up to $225 for an iPhone 6 and $250 for an iPhone 6 Plus (Apple doesn’t currently offer trade-ins for the 6S models online). At Walmart stores, the value for an iPhone 6S 16-gigabye is roughly $275 to $300, depending on the carrier; for the 6S Plus, a 16-gigabye has a trade-in value of $325 to $350. “We expect around a 15% decline in pricing for old iPhone models around the expected September launch,” says Glyde spokesman Matthew Reardon. “If people have a replacement phone they can use between now and the launch, it’s a great time to sell.” Don’t miss: Some Apple fans stick with original 2007 iPhone But for consumers who have second thoughts about upgrading, some resale sites allow you to hang on to your phone after agreeing to a trade-in deal. NextWorth and Gazelle give customers a 30-day grace period between signing a contract and handing over their phone. (Glyde has no grace period as it’s a peer-to-peer seller.) As Apple’s new-device releases become more frequent, the company must work harder to convince people to upgrade each year, says Brian Colello, technology analyst at research firm Morningstar. While the smartphone market is getting saturated in the U.S., the iPhone 7 will likely have a big impact, Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook is hoping that the upgrades and fanfare surrounding the iPhone 7 upgrade will put pressure on Samsung. Thus far, resale sites have been reporting a surge of trade-ins for all of the most recent models. Resale site Decluttr.com says there has been 73% increase in sales in the past month alone, and is predicting an influx of iPhone 6 and 6s models following Apple’s press conference on Wednesday.

Every semester, Keller, who has an MFA in creative writing, strings together a living by commuting to different college campuses. He’s what’s called a “freeway flier.” He spends a lot of time in his car. Today, Keller is teaching freshmen composition at Reedley College. It’s about a 70-mile round-trip drive from his home in Fresno. “The facetious term for us is roads scholars,” he says. He even has a bumper sticker that says, “I’m an adjunct, this is my office.” Close to two-thirds of community college teachers in California are adjuncts or part-timers, and many of them have little job security. But two companion bills are now headed to Gov. Jerry Brown, which advocates say could improve conditions. Adjuncts typically get paid only for hours they teach. When Keller started as an adjunct, he ran the math. He still wonders whether that was a good idea. “For the number of hours I was actually working, including my prep and grading time, I discovered I actually would have made more money to take a minimum wage job at Wal-Mart,” he says. Heather Chu agrees that it’s tough to be an adjunct, let alone remember where she’s supposed to be on what day. She has her master’s degree from the New England Conservatory of Music and is a choral and vocal teacher at two community colleges near Fresno. “Every other day I go to a different school,” she says. “I have to remember which school I go to. Last Thursday, went to the wrong school!” Chu is a single mom trying to make a living to support her child. Right now, she’s staying with her parents with the intent of building up her teaching resume so she can get a full-time job at a college or university. She says it’s hard counting on a specific income because classes sometimes get canceled at the last minute. “And all of a sudden in a blink of an eye, you’re denied a source of income that you may have been expecting,” Chu says. “I don’t even know that jobs in the real world do that, you know. You’re at least given some notice.” The first bill headed to the governor’s desk, AB 1690, guarantees a consistent workload to adjuncts statewide who have taught for three years. It would also give them seniority rights and other benefits. Thirty-two of the state’s 72 community college districts already have some form of seniority rights through collective bargaining. This bill would bring the other districts up to standard, Keller says. “It’s giving an opportunity for adjuncts who right now feel very, very powerless to step up and have unions that are more aggressive in looking out for their needs,” Keller says. Chu says the bill is a positive move. “To feel valued at a school that you have been putting your time in, to have that seniority and a little bit of security, would definitely be a step in the right direction,” she says. But Larry Galizio, president and CEO of the Community College League of California, says the districts are very diverse with different needs, so collective bargaining needs to stay at the local level. ”We see this as a one-size-fits-all approach, when the people closest to the issue understand much better the particular needs and where the investments need to occur to serve students in the communities,” Galizio says. The problem, he says, is really about the systematic underfunding of community colleges. “I don’t think anyone could deny the fact that part-time faculty at community colleges are often undercompensated. But the disagreement is: How do you approach that and what are the causal factors?” Galizio says. And it’s clear many administrators don’t want a top-down mandate. That’s why SB 1379 was passed shortly before the legislative session ended this week. It’s tied to AB 1690 to give that bill a greater chance of being signed into law. SB 1379 gives local districts some flexibility with negotiations. But if districts don’t offer labor agreements, they stand to lose certain program funds, says Austin Webster, director of communications for the Faculty Association of California Community Colleges. As for Jim Keller, he’s part of a good union now, but after this semester, he’s moving to Southern California to be with his husband. Keller hopes to teach at one or more community colleges, and he’s waiting to see if Brown will sign these companion bills. Otherwise, Keller says, he’s not sure what rights he’ll have.

(AP) — Hermine flooded roads and sent trees crashing into homes and power lines Friday across a wide swath of south Georgia, cutting electricity to more than 100,000 customers at one point as the storm roared inland after making landfall in Florida as a hurricane. Still, the overall damage was less than many feared, as Nick Wykoff found out after winds uprooted a burly pecan tree that punched several holes in his roof before dawn Friday. With water leaking into his bedroom, kitchen and garage, the 27-year-old Air Force mechanic braved the nasty weather in Valdosta to go buy extra buckets. The drive to Wal-Mart was stunningly uneventful. "Out of all the stuff that happened, the only real damage I see was on my own house," Wykoff said. Georgia's top emergency response official said that by midday Friday, the storm was having less of an impact on the state than he had expected. No deaths or major structural damage had been reported in 56 Georgia counties under an emergency declaration, Jim Butterworth, director of the Georgia Emergency Management and Homeland Security Agency, said in a telephone interview. Tropical storm force winds seemed to dissipate quickly as Hermine moved over dry land into Georgia. "With a storm like this you absolutely can't tell until the true impact comes inland," Butterworth said. Property damage appeared to be mostly scattered reports of trees on homes and cars, Butterworth said, and a few people suffered minor injuries from cleanup efforts — including a couple of mishaps with chain-saws. Emergency officials were looking into a report of a possible tornado touching down early Friday at a gated golf community in Savannah. The upscale community called The Landings is on Skidaway Island in east Savannah. The most widespread problem appeared to be power outages. More than 107,000 homes and businesses were without electricity across Georgia as crews worked to repair damage left by Hermine, utility companies reported around the lunch hour Friday. About 30,000 of them were in the Savannah area, and more than 20,000 others were in the Brunswick area near the coast, Georgia Power reported on its online outage map shortly before noon Friday. More than 11,000 customers were without power in hard-hit Lowndes County, the utility company reported. Thousands more outages were reported by the state's electric cooperatives, which cover many rural areas in south Georgia. The National Weather Service reported winds up to 55 mph tore through Valdosta and surrounding Lowndes County early Friday. Melvin Gatlin Sr., 84, of Valdosta awoke with a fright before dawn to the sound of a thundering crack that shook his whole house. "I thought somebody had shot me, the way it sounded," Gatlin said a few hours later in his living room, where a cooking pot on the floor caught water dripping from the ceiling. The storm's winds toppled a pine tree in the backyard onto Gatlin's home of more than 40 years. The trunk crushed a storage shed where Gatlin kept his deep freezer and lawn mower. It also made a tear in his roof. "Nobody got hurt," said Gatlin's son, Melvin Gatlin Jr. "That's the best part." Howling winds, falling limbs and trash cans rattling across yards kept some of Gatlin's neighbors awake overnight. "I couldn't sleep. I walked the floor," said Betty Campbell, who lives three houses away from Gatlin. Campbell watched the rain with her daughter and a friend under the shelter of her carport Friday morning. Her husband was still dozing inside. "He slept through it," Campbell said. "He told me to leave him alone." ___ Associated Press writer Jeff Martin in Atlanta contributed to this report.

A closer look at Disney's Golden Oak community, where people can actually live on Disney World property. Sandra PediciniContact ReporterOrlando Sentinel Sponsored Visit Orlandotickets.com; Your source for discount park tickets Privacy Policy Carl Guidice has loved Walt Disney World since he was a kid, but he never expected to make it his permanent address. Guidice bought a house at Golden Oak, the luxury residential community on Disney property, expecting to vacation there. He and his family were perfectly happy living on the Hawaiian island of Maui. The Walt Disney Co. has been surprised by how many home buyers have put down roots at Golden Oak, a gated collection of multimillion dollar mansions first announced in 2010. It didn't take long, though, for Guidice to trade waterfalls and volcanoes for a view of the Magic Kingdom's fireworks from his bedroom. The Walt Disney Co. has been surprised by how many home buyers have put down roots at Golden Oak, a gated collection of multimillion dollar mansions first announced in 2010. "I thought starting off we would have about 80 percent ... vacation homes and 20 percent would be what I would call primary residences," said Page Pierce, vice president of Disney resort real estate development. Instead, "almost 40 percent of our residents call Golden Oak home. A lot of them have started off as vacation homes ... [and] they have become permanent residents." After it is sold out in five years, Pierce thinks full-time residents, living there nine months or more a year, will make up more than half the development. Future plans reflect that. Golden Oak is providing amenities such as a planned 3-acre park with a playground and basketball court in its newest neighborhood, Kingswell.

Mayor Todd Watzel has had one of the most uneventful political careers in history. He rarely makes public appearances. Reporters don't grill him on controversial issues. Campaigning? With only 21 constituents, about a third of them too young to vote, he doesn't need to bother. Watzel leads the... (Sandra Pedicini) Guidice said he; his wife, Rebecca; and 13-year-old daughter Mikayla found a strong sense of community among the Disneyphiles who live there. "I have more friends in this neighborhood than any neighborhood I've lived in. Employees become part of the family," said Guidice, 55, a human resources executive. "It's a very one-of-a-kind kind of a place." Golden Oak sells the dream of living at Disney World to an exclusive audience. Prices start at $2 million and go past $10 million. That does not include more than $20,000 annually in homeowner association and club fees. Residents include H. Lee Scott, Wal-Mart's former chief executive officer. Plans for Golden Oak have been scaled back, from 450 homes to 300. About 100 houses have been completed. Pierce said Disney scrapped plans for condominiums — a little-advertised aspect of the development when it was first announced — as it realized Golden Oak "was really a place where we wanted to bring in families." Disney this year began reaching out to real estate brokers, encouraging them to market the property to people seeking primary residences here. For Eric and Kim Casaburi, moving to Florida from New Jersey with their four children was almost as much about money as Disney magic. If you've got the roller coaster bug, love fireworks and wear mouse ears more than once per week, we've got some houses that might be of interest. All the homes in this gallery are currently listed for sale on Zillow.  (Sandy Csizmar) "When you have a no-income tax state, that's a big difference," said Eric Casaburi, 42, who runs a chain of gyms. "It was kind of like a twofold benefit." The couple rave about the concierge services at Golden Oak, where Kim Casaburi said "the standards are just so high." Golden Oak provides niceties other luxury locales can't, from a ride on Space Mountain with the lights on to helping obtain scarce tickets for Shanghai Disneyland's debut. Golden Oak, nestled diagonally across from Disney's Port Orleans resort, is also home to the five-star Four Seasons. Residents can access the Four Seasons' amenities. There are tastefully appointed Disney touches throughout the 980-acre development, such as bronze statues of characters including Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. On the outside, at least, the place whispers Disney rather than screaming it. Buyers have numerous architectural restrictions on classically styled homes. On the inside, though, owners can go all out. Guidice's home has hidden Mickeys — a common feature around Golden Oak — and tiny Snogies from "Frozen" painted on the walls. An Olaf statue overlooks the pool. Interior doors feature carved Disney characters. Mickey, Minnie and Donald silhouettes adorn stairway railings. That's restrained compared with others. Rial Jones, whose construction company is one of eight approved to build in Golden Oak, has become accustomed to building full-blown Disney fantasies. One house under construction, for a single man in his 20s, will feature a drawbridge between the bathroom and bedroom and a submarine-themed basement with a porthole providing an underwater pool view. Jones is also building a 20,000-square-foot house that will include a Cinderella-inspired 50-foot-long ballroom, an "Alice in Wonderland" themed bunk room with singing cake platters, and a re-creation of the Haunted Mansion's stretching room. Jones has found himself making Disney World visits to ensure he gets he details just right. Jones was an original builder in Celebration, the more traditional community that Disney developed in Osceola County. "We were used to being around the Disney company and having Disney fans for customers but not to this level," he said. "This is uncharted territory."

See Offers Business Posted September 3, 2016 Updated September 3, 2016 increase font size Sanford rug manufacturer is hanging by a thread Flemish Master Weavers says it will have to cease manufacturing unless it gets approval to avoid tariffs on imported yarn. By J. Craig Anderson Staff Writer Follow on Twitter Email Writer 207-791-6390 Share Comment Read Article 1 of 0 A major rug manufacturer in Sanford says it is poised to either expand or collapse depending on the outcome of its pending request for free trade status to import yarn without paying tariffs. Flemish Master Weavers, which employs about 130 people in Maine, is trying to tap into a little-used federal program that would allow it to avoid duty payments of 8 percent to 9 percent on the polyester and polypropylene fibers it imports from Turkey to make its Oriental-style rugs. The company said it is caught between U.S. competitors that pay no tariffs because they produce their own yarn, and increasingly large overseas competitors that can undercut prices with lower labor costs. However, it faces an uphill battle in its quest for trade zone status because of objections from within the U.S. textile industry. If it succeeds, the company plans a major expansion of its 210,000-square-foot manufacturing facility, President Johan Moulin said. If its free trade status is denied by the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Foreign Trade Zones Board, competitive pressures likely will force it to phase out domestic manufacturing altogether. All of the factory jobs in Sanford would be lost. “Over time, we’ll become an importing company instead of a manufacturer,” Moulin said of the 28-year-old business. “That’s what I’m afraid of.” Flemish Master Weavers is a major player in the home products industry and is one of Sanford’s largest employers. Its 11 enormous looms produce about 2.5 million square meters of rug each year, which can be purchased at retailers including Macy’s, Home Depot, Wal-Mart and Bob’s Discount Furniture. It is one of only four large rug manufacturers remaining in the United States. The problem, Moulin said, is that the company is the only U.S. rug manufacturer that lacks its own yarn-making operation. Its competitors are older companies that own such equipment, which he said would cost the company upwards of $5 million to purchase. That’s more than it can afford, meaning the only affordable way to procure yarn is to buy it overseas. But while imported yarn is taxed at 8 percent for polypropylene and 8.8 percent for polyester, fully manufactured rugs made of those materials can be imported with no tariffs. Moulin said he thinks the bizarre inconsistency is a result of some decades-old regulatory oversight, but that there is no political will to rectify it. “Nobody’s going to look at the tariff of one item in the code because of one manufacturer in Maine,” he said. COMPETITION GLOBALLY AND AT HOME There is a potential way around the problem, but it is being threatened by opposition from the U.S. textile industry. Maine has five established foreign trade zones: in Waterville, Auburn, Bangor, Madawaska and Brunswick. Such zones are specially designated areas that operate almost like duty-free shops for manufacturers that import and export products. Import duties on raw materials used in production are waived, and some export fees also can be waived. Compliance costs associated with capitalizing on their benefits have curtailed the use of Maine’s trade zones, but Moulin said the company is willing to front those costs, which include turning the manufacturing site into a Department of Homeland Security-approved import site with fencing and other security measures. Obtaining trade zone status would save the company roughly $1 million a year on its materials costs, he said. “It’s not that we are asking for an advantage or a benefit,” Moulin said. “We are just looking to level the playing field.” So Flemish Master Weavers requested an extension of Waterville’s foreign trade zone to include the Sanford operation as a “subzone,” and in July, it received preliminary approval. However, there was a problem. Three trade groups – the American Fiber Manufacturers Association, National Council of Textile Organizations and United States Industrial Fabrics Institute – jointly filed an objection to the company’s trade zone application. That objection letter could be enough to derail the company’s application, said Wayne Coleman, a consultant Moulin hired to help Flemish obtain the trade zone status. “With one objection from commerce, it can put the kibosh on the whole process,” said Coleman, president and chief operating officer of Memphis, Tennessee-based FTZ Networks Inc. In their objection, the trade groups argued that there are U.S. suppliers of plastic yarn from which Flemish Master Weavers could be buying its materials, and that those domestic suppliers could be harmed in the future by any action to avoid tariffs on foreign yarn. “Approval of this petition … would harm existing producers of the yarns in interest and also set a damaging precedent threatening broad nullification of the established import duty structure for polyester and polypropylene yarn used in U.S. production of area rugs,” it said. Moulin said the problem with that argument is that there are only a handful of domestic producers of poly yarn: boutique manufacturers that lack the production capacity to meet Flemish’s needs, and Flemish’s rug-making competitors. “First of all, they probably wouldn’t want to sell it to us to begin with,” Moulin said. If they did, he estimated the cost would be about 33 percent more than the imported Turkish yarn, even with the tariff included. Given that the company has no realistic options to domestically source its yarn and is at a disadvantage against both foreign and domestic competitors, Moulin was surprised that the industry groups turned against him. “Why are they not defending us? They should be supporting us,” he said. “We are creating jobs in the textile industry.” Writing on behalf of the three organizations opposing the trade zone application, National Council of Textile Organizations spokesman Lloyd Wood said via email that the groups would not answer specific questions because the application is still pending. He did add that the organizations believe Flemish Master Weavers’ application is inappropriate because it is for a fast-tracked summary approval intended for uncontested cases. “The American Fiber Manufacturers Association, National Council of Textile Organization and the U.S. Industrial Fabrics Institute jointly opposed the summary application in favor of examining the full range of facts required by the Foreign Trade Zones Board under its regular application procedure,” Wood said. “The company has the opportunity to refile on those standard terms.” Moulin and Coleman hope to get help from Maine’s congressional delegation. Coleman said he has a meeting scheduled for Sept. 19 with Sen. Angus King, and that he has asked Sen. Susan Collins to attend, as well. “They’re keenly aware of the stakes here,” Coleman said. Flemish Master Weavers is part of Natco Home Fashions Inc., a Rhode Island company, and has operated its rug-making business in Sanford since 1991. Natco is one of the largest companies in the home textiles industry, with manufacturing facilities in Georgia, Maine and Toronto, as well as several joint ventures in China. Central Oriental is the fashion brand for the company. In 2002, Natco purchased a majority interest in Flemish Master Weavers, which had previously operated under the name Rainbow Rugs. The company has been planning a 78,000-square-foot expansion, Moulin said, but those plans are on hold and only will be carried out if the company obtains trade zone status. Otherwise, it’s likely that Natco will slowly scale back the manufacturing side of Flemish Master Weavers and shift to a model that relies solely on imported rugs. That would mean major job losses in Sanford. “We are a prime, prime, prime example of why legislation created the foreign trade zone,” he said.

KennebunkportPatriot Why should we grant tax exemptions for foreign imports for one small firm, when competing US companies can source US-made fibers and be profitable? There is nothing regionally unique about plastics – we are not talking about Belgian wool, or Scottish mohair. I think this company’s business model may contain a major flaw. A better solution would be for a low- or no- interest loan to purchase the equipment to let this company produce its own yarn, which would increase its business operations, provide a US producer of the raw material more business, and keep money within the US. In a company with that number of employees, $5 million paid for over X years out of increased profits should be do-able. reed1v A better solution is to make wool rugs of local wool. Better product, and probably better quality. Mark Gravel Local wool? Does that even exist? reed1v Indeed it does. Maine has a thriving wool industry based on alpacas, sheep, and other furry critters. Even has a growing beef industry, but that is mostly angus moo cows. Becoming the uber upscale food supplier to the world. Mark Gravel Government subsidized alpacas? I hope not. reed1v On the hoof, its a subsidy; once in the bag its taxable. KennebunkportPatriot Probably. It may require new looms. I am not certain. mghmaine Its customers aren’t buying wool rugs. KennebunkportPatriot They certainly aren’t buying Flemish rugs. reed1v Really can not best a wool rug for durability, feel, and mold resistance. Tim Bucktoo They don’t use wool, if you can read. reed1v Yes, that is why they should convert to natural fibers. charlie s Excellent post. If this company looks at a situation like this and declares that there are only two possible outcomes, either get the exemption or go out of business, I have to agree that their business model is terrible. Mark Gravel Reading Between the Lines: There is nothing wrong with their business model. Their statement is an ultimatum. Give the tax break, or we are walking. I say good for them. mghmaine I say typical corporate extortion. Mark Gravel A business is not in business for an humanitarian effort. A business is in business to make money. When regulation and taxes makes it impossible to continue doing business in a geographical area, it is only natural they will gravitate to cheaper operating environments. A business just not uproot its operations for a few pennies, but it will when the savings is significant. This country probably has the highest corporate tax rate on the planet – 35%. It is any wonder why companies move manufacturing out of the US. The reason is clear; the solution is clear. It is that simple. mghmaine Surely you are right about corporate taxes, and about the general effects of tax policy, but it doesn’t seem on point in this case. This one company wants individual tariff relief because, it seems, it failed to invest in thread- making as all its domestic competitors did. Its trade association is against its request. In short it wants special treatment or it will go away. Mark Gravel A tariff is a tax; a tariff is policy; a tariff is tax policy. This situation is about tax policy. Midwinter Sounds like the executives of that company need a box of tissues.. “Gimme what we want or eliminate jobs…” Right.. They will only stop production of carpets if their business model is so flawed they can’t make money. RichardBroderickJr Everyone wants a special favor. . KennebunkportPatriot It sounds as though they want an easy solution. Janey04090 A small local business should get a “special favor”, after all look at all the tax breaks walmart gets? We should support local businesses. mghmaine Taxes are best when paid by others. Mark Gravel What special favor do you want? Mark Gravel Vote Trump 2016. Let him put tariffs on finished goods and remove tariffs on unfinished goods. Sounds like a win-win for US manufacturing. ebelmaine Who’s their main customer? Mardens?

Sections Search Help/Info Subscribe: Digital | Home Delivery Subscribe Help/Info     Breaking News Bar   Indiana posted: 9/3/2016 7:00 AM Farmer's market with twist expands into southern Indiana Facebook Twitter 200 Email Print Comments 0 hello Article to: (required) Article from: (required) Add a message (optional) Success - Article sent! close   By DANIELLE GRADY     NEW ALBANY, Ind. -- Karyn Moskowitz, a Paoli native, is "veggie obsessed." She moved to Louisville from her rural town to establish farmers markets on the city's east and west sides, where access to fresh food was sparse. But farmers and residents were leaving her markets empty-handed. The shoppers couldn't afford to buy the fruits and vegetables at the retail price at which farmers had to sell them. That's when Moskowitz decided to get innovative - borrowing a system from a Cleveland organization that solved the problem and now allows her nonprofit, New Roots, to operate 10 of their Fresh Stop Markets in Louisville and one in New Albany - the first in Southern Indiana. The market opened in June after months of planning among New Roots, the New Albany Housing Authority (NA HA) and volunteers. Two months later and NAHA's Brown-Starks Building welcomes an average of 45 families every other Thursday to New Albany's market. Christine Boswell is part of one of those families. She moved among brightly-patterned tables Aug. 25, when picking up two ears of corn and then a bunch of radishes, placing each vegetable in the bag New Roots provides its customer. Each of the foods she selected sat next to a chalkboard that told which nearby farm grew them. A spaghetti squash Boswell chose traveled to New Albany from a farm in Oldham County, Ky. New Roots' markets sell 25 percent of their produce, said Moskowitz. As for Boswell, she snagged 15 to 20 pounds of organic food by the time she was ready to leave. It was her first time at a Fresh Stop Market. "I didn't expect this," she said. Here's how the markets work: The customers are called shareholders. They have to say if they're coming to the next market a week before it takes place. They pay at that time, anywhere from $6 to $25, depending on their financial need. Shareholders on SNAP or who receive food stamps pay $12, WIC shareholders pay $6 and everyone else pays $25. New Roots then orders the amount of produce needed for the next market from their base of farmers. Farms such as the one in Oldham County don't have to worry about unsold food and shareholders get fresh produce at a discount. And that produce? If you taste it, you'll "never be the same," Moskowitz said. Candace Brewer certainly isn't. THE SHAREHOLDERS Brewer, the outreach leader for the New Albany Fresh Stop Market, barely left her house one year ago. The NAHA resident was chained to her pill counter, she said. The 38 medications she said she took treated high blood pressure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and high cholesterol, among other ailments. Brewer also didn't have a car. When she first moved to New Albany with her 9- and 10-year-old granddaughters, she had to walk three hours to get to Walmart. Brewer takes only two pills now after being involved with New Roots since January. She promotes the New Albany market to the community, knocking on doors, handing out fliers and posting to the market's Facebook page. On Thursday, Brewer spent five hours preparing for and then working at the market. The program gives her a reason to stay active, she said. Brewer's eating habits have gotten better in the past seven months, too. Her weekly menus feature eggplant lasagna and vegetable spaghetti. As an added bonus, her grocery bills are lower, she said. Brewer attributes the upswing in her health to the food she eats now. Moskowitz said she feels better since getting her food from the markets, too, but she doesn't go so far as to say organic food cures illnesses. "You really have to try it and see what's right for you, your body and your family," she said. Brewer does fit the description of who Moskowitz wants to help with the markets. Brewer lives on the cusp of a food desert as defined by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Food deserts are low-income areas where many residents don't have access to a supermarket or large grocery store. There are several in Clark and Floyd counties. Seventy-five percent of the shares at the Fresh Stop Markets are reserved for families on WIC. Moskowitz also looks to Brewer as an example because she's a community member who is heavily involved in the New Albany Fresh Stop Market. New Roots doesn't go to communities unless its residents make room for them. In New Albany's case, NAHA heard of New Roots and asked that a Fresh Stop Market be established in the area. New Roots applies a similar approach to its farmers. They're in charge of delivering their food to the markets. THE FARMERS Greg Graft is the vice president and general manager of Grateful Greens in Clarksville. His business grows and sells all things leafy - from romaine to kale. He doesn't mind delivering his produce to the different Fresh Stop Markets. Not when the system works so well for him. "You couldn't ask for a better set up," Graft said. He gets paid before he delivers, and he doesn't have to worry about whether or not his food gets taken home. It's not like Graft doesn't get business elsewhere. He primarily sells to restaurants, caterers and hotels, which are particular about the produce they get. Still, he likes working with farmers markets, supplying them with his surplus crops. Getting a spot in a farmers market is a process, though, Graft said. Some give trial runs to different farmers before letting them come regularly. Graft's been trying for a year to get into the New Albany Farmers Market. Moskowitz appreciates Grateful Greens, she said, but Graft isn't the farmer who gives the most to New Roots. He can only provide greens, but the Fresh Stop Markets need a variety of produce. New Roots has six main farmers who provide 80 percent of the food it sells. New Roots is lucky to operate in Southern Indiana and Kentucky, where there are so many farmers, Moskowitz said. Fifty farmers contribute to New Roots, but the founder would still like to see more help out. THE FUTURE Moskowitz is interested in expanding her fresh markets to more areas in Southern Indiana, she said, but she won't go to a community unless she's wanted there. A movement is already underway in Jeffersonville to start a Fresh Stop Market there. Moskowitz has been approached by some community members in the town, and she'll be attending a meeting there next week. No matter what, Jeffersonville will still have to wait until next growing season to get its market. There are other signs that Southern Indiana values New Roots. The organization recently received a $15,000 grant from the Community Foundation of Southern Indiana to continue its expansion in the area. Moskowitz isn't sure how the money will be spent, but she can see it helping the market set up outside more often. Being outside means more people will see the market and sign up. When Moskowitz first started New Roots, she wasn't sure how the markets would turn out. It was hard to persuade families to part with $12 for food they hadn't seen yet. Now that Moskowitz is seven years into her project, she can see why it's done so well. Of course it wasn't going to fail, she said, it's just a great model. ___ Source: News and Tribune, http://bit.ly/2bxSFSm ___ Information from: News and Tribune, Jeffersonville, Ind., http://www.newsandtribune.com Tweet This article filed under: News Indiana Associated Press Article Comments () Guidelines: Keep it civil and on topic; no profanity, vulgarity, slurs or personal attacks.

Schools have been in session for a couple of weeks and families are getting settled in a more structured routine. It’s a time of anticipation as we begin to make the transition to autumn, a favorite season of mine. In early August I was in Walmart and saw numerous back to school signs. In the school supply aisles parents were checking off items on their list as the children excitedly placed the treasures in the shopping cart. I overheard one mother explain to her children that she did not have the funds, but assured them there would be plenty of free school supplies available again this year, just like last year. The kids seemed satisfied. All students deserve necessary school supplies whether the parents can afford them or not. They need to know education is highly valued and should be taken very seriously. I’m all for giving needy families a helping hand and every August Jo Anne and I purchase a large bag of school supplies to donate to various agencies. I wonder if there is a better approach than just handing the kids school supplies year after year. Do these annual freebies unintentionally instill an attitude of entitlement in children and their parents? If so, that is not healthy. Most adults have learned that it is more blessed to give than to receive so perhaps the kids should be given an opportunity to learn this lesson at a young age. Let’s provide them a way to be on both the giving and receiving end. Is it unreasonable to expect children and youth to do a few hours of community service to earn vouchers that can be exchanged for school supplies? They could read books to younger children, help out at the library, sort food at the food pantry, sweep sidewalks, do projects in their neighborhood or church, pick up litter, pull weeds, walk dogs, or visit nursing homes, to mention a few possibilities.

MuscatineJournal.com Daily Headlines Obituaries I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site consitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy. Yes, implementing a voucher system and arranging for children to do age appropriate community service would be a challenge, but I believe the long term advantages to the family and society would be worth the effort. Perhaps it could start as a small pilot program and then grow each year. Hopefully the parents would see the value in it and give it their support. Please understand, this suggested approach is not about the money; it’s about teaching children the joy and value of earning the things they need and want. Yes, it’s much easier for agencies to routinely hand students the supplies they need each year and be done with it. The harder route is to teach them a valuable lesson regarding the importance, along with society’s expectations, of being productive citizens. It’s never too early for them to learn. That lesson is considerably more valuable than a backpack full of school supplies.

Sections Deseret NewsUtah Utah Wasatch High students rally to support American flag after one is burned in school parking lot By Ben LockhartDeseret News@benlockhart89 Published: Sept. 2, 2016 9:50 p.m. 4 Comments HEBER CITY — Dozens of Wasatch High School students met together Friday to celebrate the American flag in response to the burning of a flag in the school's parking lot the day before. Friday morning, about 30 students met outside of Wal-Mart in Heber City, waving an assortment of American flags, and then again outside the school. Some even wore attire patterned with the iconic stars and stripes. Samantha Emmanuel, one of the participating students, said she and the others were appalled at the vandalism. "There are thousands and thousands of soldiers (in) a couple different countries right now fighting for you to come to school and then you just burned (the flag) up like like that?" Emmanuel said. The flag, which was in a truck bed, was burned Thursday afternoon in the school parking lot, according to the Wasatch County School District. The person responsible is a Wasatch High student and they are cooperating with investigators, the school district reported. "At the conclusion of the investigation, the student will be disciplined in accordance with district policy," school district spokesman John Moss said in a statement. Attempts to obtain comment from Heber City police were unsuccessful. Wasastch High student Ben Schofield says it was his flag and truck that were targeted. He called the burning "very disrespectful." "Someone just made a poor decision at that time and I just think (my flag) was (in) the wrong place at the wrong time," Schofield said. The truck also suffered some damage in the fire. Schofield and the other students who carried American flags Friday made sure to answer the vandalism with even more obvious expressions of patriotism. Emmanuel said some students flew flags from their cars and received an encouraging reaction from Heber City residents. "Just driving around town and getting all the honks, it's amazing the feeling you get afterwards," she said. Though the students enjoyed the display of unity, some remain baffled at why anyone would vandalize the flag. 4 comments on this story "I honestly don't understand why somebody would do that. It's really disrespectful," said Wasatch High student Tiersa Trump. Contributing: Ashley Moser Email: blockhart@deseretnews.com Twitter: benlockhartnews 4 Comments Like that? Read this.

But next year’s will be even leaner. City Manager Eleazar Garcia has proposed a $3.79 million general fund budget with $1 million in cash reserves, 18 months after the closure of the 3,000-bed WillacyCountyCorrectionalCenter slashed about $600,000 in water and sewer revenue. Then last January, Wal-Mart shut down its supercenter, cutting into the city’s sales tax revenue while laying off 149 employees. “Everything’s pretty good considering the problems we’ve had as a city and county,” Mayor Gilbert Gonzales said Friday. “We’re going to survive this and move forward.” The proposed budget is so tight employees likely won’t get raises this year, Gonzales said. It would be the second straight year employees would go without raises.

By ANNE D’INNOCENZIO and ROBERT JABLON, Associated Press Published: September 2, 2016, 4:55 PM A   A NEW YORK — Some major retailers are scrambling to work out contingency plans to get their merchandise to stores as the bankruptcy of the Hanjin shipping line has thrown ports and retailers around the world into confusion. They don’t have a lot of time. Giant container ships from the South Korean-based Hanjin shipping line are marooned with their cargo of what experts say are lots of TVs and printers, but also loads of home furnishings and clothing. Hanjin, the world’s seventh-largest container shipper, filed for bankruptcy protection Wednesday and stopped accepting new cargo. With its assets being frozen, ships from China to Canada were refused permission to offload or take aboard containers because there were no guarantees that tugboat pilots or stevedores would be paid. It’s also been a factor in shipping rates rising and could hurt some trucking firms with contracts to pick up goods from Hanjin ships. The South Korean giant represents nearly 8 percent of the trans-Pacific trade volume for the U.S. market. While some retailers may already have merchandise for the holiday season affected, experts say what’s most important is that the issue be resolved before the critical shipping month of October. “Retailers always have robust contingency plans, but this degree of uncertainty is making it challenging to put those plans in place,” said Jessica Dankert, senior director of retail operations for the Retail Industry Leaders Association, a trade alliance with members including companies such as Best Buy, Wal-Mart and Target. J.C. Penney said Hanjin is one of several ocean freight carriers that it uses and when it learned there might be an issue it began to divert and reroute its containers. It said it uses “a variety of transportation methods and ports” and right now does not expect a significant effect on the flow of merchandise. Target Corp. said it is watching the situation closely and Wal-Mart said it is waiting for details about Hanjin’s bankruptcy proceedings and the implications to its merchandise before it could assess the effect. As of Friday, 27 ships had been refused entry to ports or terminals, said Hanjin Shipping spokesman Park Min. The Seoul-based company said one ship in Singapore had been seized by the ship’s owner. At the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, the nation’s busiest port complex, three Hanjin container ships ranging from about 700 feet to 1,100 feet long were either drifting offshore or anchored away from terminals Thursday. A fourth vessel that was supposed to leave Long Beach on Thursday morning remained anchored inside the breakwater. Hanjin pulled out of business with the Port of Portland in 2015 because of labor disputes at the port. “Hanjin called us and said: ‘We’re going bankrupt and we can’t pay any bills — so don’t bother asking,’ ” said J. Kip Louttit, executive director of the Marine Exchange of Southern California, which provides traffic control for the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. That’s meant cargo headed to and from Asia is in limbo, much to the distress of merchants looking to stock shelves with fall fashions or Christmas toys. “Someone from the garment industry called earlier today asking: ‘How long is this going to go on, because I’ve got clothing out there,”‘ Louttit said. Chris Rogers, a research analyst at Panjiva, which tracks international imports to the United States, said the situation isn’t yet dire but could become so.

Menu Voices Home Ocean Views Home BioBlitz Cat Watch Explorers Journal Fulbright Stories Voice for Elephants Water Currents Does Your Favorite Restaurant Serve Ocean Destruction? Posted by Greenpeace in Ocean Views on September 2, 2016 (2) More » By Greenpeace Oceans Campaigner David Pinsky Every time you eat in a restaurant, hospital, airport, university cafeteria, or even at a rock concert, it is likely that you are eating food provided by a large foodservice company. Sea of Distress, a brand new Greenpeace report, highlights which large food companies are failing to protect workers and our oceans. Home to one million species, covering over seventy percent of our planet, providing life-sustaining oxygen (every other breath we take), and providing food for billions of people globally—the world’s oceans are a beautiful and mysterious place. Like many ecosystems on planet Earth, our oceans are under constant threats from climate change to pollution. The global seafood industry is quite effective at emptying our oceans in the quest for profits, leading to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of sea turtles, seabirds, and up to 100 million sharks a year all while driving some fish stocks toward the brink of collapse. We are in dangerous waters as the global seafood industry continues to expand and increase the amount of seafood it produces every year. Despite the science, corporate greed continues to harm the world’s oceans and the people who work to supply seafood or rely on it for their livelihoods. Since the 1970s, Greenpeace has campaigned to protect marine life and the world’s oceans. Today our mission is ever more critical. The U.S. is a big market for seafood with the power to globally influence whether companies properly steward the oceans or continue to exploit them. Every day, roughly half of the money Americans spend on food outside the home is gobbled up by the foodservice industry. But, what exactly is foodservice? Companies that buy, transport, cook, or serve the food you get at Subway, Burger King, a Beyoncé show or the Super Bowl, Walmart corporate cafeterias, the University of Kentucky, Chicago Public Schools, Yosemite National Park, Hilton hotels, or even in the U.S. Capitol’s cafeterias. Some large clients of U.S. foodservice companies. Foodservice is one of the largest industries we frequent often, but most of us know nothing about. These companies buy and sell billions of dollars of seafood annually, and some of it is destructively caught and potentially connected to forced labor. Consumers have a right to know where their seafood comes from, and whether the establishments where they go out to eat are linked to ocean destruction or forced labor. How do the companies rank that supply and serve up tuna at Subway, fried shrimp at Disney World, or a tuna salad sandwich in a cafeteria for Toyota employees? Glad you asked. A new Greenpeace report, Sea of Distress, ranks the seafood sustainability and social responsibility of foodservice companies. Just three companies passed: Sodexo, Compass Group, and Aramark, while two of the largest companies—Sysco and US Foods—are among the twelve that failed.   Many companies are supplied by Thai Union Group, the largest tuna company in the world that owns U.S. brand Chicken of the Sea and supplies supermarkets like Walmart and Kroger. Thai Union is notorious for ocean destruction. And some of its seafood supply chains have been linked to human rights abuses, where seafood workers were forced to work under horrendous conditions for months with no escape. From the halls of Congress to your university, favorite restaurant, or workplace – you could be eating seafood connected to ocean destruction or human rights abuses. It’s easy to make informed choices at the supermarket, but when you’re eating in a cafeteria or at a football game you could be eating seafood connected to ocean destruction or even human rights abuses and you’d never know. Foodservice companies (e.g., Sysco, US Foods), large clients (e.g., Subway, Yosemite National Park, Kroger), and consumers have the power to transform a global industry ripping up the sea and exploiting workers. It’s time for companies profiting off of ocean destruction and mistreated workers to change. For example, as one of the nation’s largest supermarket chains, Kroger could demand that Sysco—its supplier for food at delis and convenience stores nationwide—only provide sustainable, ethical canned tuna. To honor Kroger’s request, Sysco could in turn demand that one of its tuna suppliers—Thai Union—guarantee that any tuna it provides Sysco is sustainably and ethically caught, requiring the tuna giant improve its operations and helping to create change on the water. Both foodservice companies and their clients need to have strong, public-facing policies that ensure they only provide sustainable seafood and protect workers’ rights from the U.S. to Southeast Asia. Consumers deserve traceable seafood, transparency, and a guarantee that their hard-earned money is not supporting ocean destruction or forced labor. Whether you’re grabbing a snack at a Kroger deli, sitting down for dinner at Red Lobster, or getting lunch between classes at George Washington University, ask the person serving you seafood if it is supplied by Thai Union. Ask whether it is green-rated “Best Choice” seafood according to the Monterey Bay Aquarium. Ask if the food provider guarantees that the seafood it serves is sustainably and ethically procured. If you don’t like their responses, take your business elsewhere. You can also try reducing your seafood consumption to help lessen pressure on our oceans and ensure fish for the future.

Keywords Greenpeace oceans sustainable seafood (2) More » Comments Greenpeace September 2, 2016, 3:26 pm Our assessment and recommendations are based on best available science and leading experts. Company inventories were benchmarked against a respected sustainability measure, the Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch recommendations. There is no “best guess” scoring, which is why Sysco, US Foods, Centerplate, and the eight other profiled companies failed. While we use all publicly available data to assess a company’s performance, even Sysco, which has worked for years to improve its seafood program, failed because of the lack of publicly available data on its policies, procurement, and advocacy efforts. Transparency for customers matters. Greenpeace notified all 15 companies in November 2015 that they would be included in the report. In December 2015, each company received the seven-page survey. While a handful of companies provided some information, they refused to participate in the survey process, thus Greenpeace cannot “guess” how a company is performing. Perhaps when large clients and consumers learn about the lack of transparency from broadline distributors and management companies they will raise their concerns directly with the companies. As you indicate, protecting our oceans is an incredibly important issue. Allowing Sysco and other broadline distributors off the hook because they must cater to a customer’s demand for seafood–whether sustainable or not–is unacceptable. If Sysco and other large foodservice companies plan to continue profiting off of our oceans, it is time to act responsibly and only provide sustainable, ethical seafood. Reinhart Foodservice sells bluefin tuna. Are you suggesting Reinhart should continue to sell an extremely threatened species because it needs to satisfy customers and maintain its profits? If that’s the model you suggest companies follow, foodservice will be in dire straights in the coming decades as overcapacity and destructive fishing continue to decimate our oceans. Thank you for raising the point about loose policy compliance. This is why Greenpeace asks companies to make public commitments and post their policies online — so they will be held accountable. A broken system rewarding profits at the expense of non-compliance with policies, unsustainable fishing, and potentially unethical fishing is exactly why groups like Greenpeace are fighting to change the market. I absolutely agree that influencing consumers and lawmakers is a pathway to improvements. We need culture change, consumers educated about sustainable seafood, and policies in place from governments and RFMOs that will protect our oceans for generations to come. That’s why we’re working hard to change big companies that so effectively lobby government and RFMOs; that actively work to maintain the status quo despite the science. That’s why we listed big name clients in the report from United Airlines to Yosemite National Park to Disney World. That’s why we’ve sent this report directly to leadership at many of those clients and to government officials. And that’s why we’re blogging about our findings on National Geographic’s site, so concerned citizens can learn more and help take action. Thank you for your feedback. Together we can change the foodservice industry and global seafood industry. -David Pinsky Alan Smithee Chicago September 2, 2016, 11:20 am While I applaud Greenpeace’s commitment toward protecting our natural resources, especially our seas, I cannot support fatally flawed studies such as this. Publishing un-scientific studies that lack any statistical rigor or third-party verification does a disservice to the movement and further damages Greenpeace’s credibility. It makes it too easy for corporations to debunk the work and undermine the cause in general. To find broad acceptance of it’s mission and philosophies Greenpeace must avoid using the tactics of extremists and adopt academically rigorous processes. The sad fact is that only 3 corporations participated fully in your study (coincidentally your top 3 scorers). Assigning scores to the others based on your ‘best guess’ of what their responses would be is unprofessional and misleading. Instead, you should be asking yourselves how to better incentivize their participation. Further, lumping customers in with the broadliners that service them is like comparing apples to oranges. In the context of this study, for example, Sodexo is the customer (with the power to create demand for sustainable products) while Sysco is the service provider. Sysco’s role is to carry the products its customers demand, whether they meet Sustainable standards or not. The fact is that MSC certified Pole and Line caught tuna is more expensive than conventional and cannot be forced on the market. Broadliners will never discontinue carrying these products as long as significant demand exists. Blaming them for doing so is pointless, since their role is to distribute the products their customers demand. They are not arbiters of what is or is not sustainable, and refusing to carry conventional seafood would cause a huge financial hit. Instead, Greenpeace’s focus should be on convincing consumers and the service providers closest to them (like Sodexo). Foodservice broadliners are at best twice removed and are only reflections of the marketplace. Furthermore, your survey assumes that the self-reported responses are gospel fact. In reality, many companies use their policies as guidelines and are very willing to play loose with the requirements when it’s financially expedient. One of your 3 participating companies, for example, initially required canned tuna products to be exclusively pole and line caught but abandoned the stipulation once the market firmed up and it became too expensive. Changing the minds of consumers and lawmakers is the only path to success. Corporations’ policies will never converge with Greenpeace objectives unless they feel it’s in their own financial interest.

Hermine was downgraded to a tropical storm after it made landfall, as it moves over Georgia, but the U.S. National Hurricane Center says winds are increasing along the Southeast coast and flooding rains continue. Photo by Associated Press /Times Free Press. VALDOSTA, Ga. — Hermine flooded roads and sent trees crashing into homes and power lines Friday across a wide swath of south Georgia, cutting electricity to more than 100,000 customers at one point as the storm roared inland after making landfall in Florida as a hurricane. Still, the overall damage was less than many feared, as Nick Wykoff found out after winds uprooted a burly pecan tree that punched several holes in his roof before dawn Friday. With water leaking into his bedroom, kitchen and garage, the 27-year-old Air Force mechanic braved the nasty weather in Valdosta to go buy extra buckets. The drive to Wal-Mart was stunningly uneventful. "Out of all the stuff that happened, the only real damage I see was on my own house," Wykoff said. Georgia's top emergency response official said that by midday Friday, the storm was having less of an impact on the state than he had expected. No deaths or major structural damage had been reported in 56 Georgia counties under an emergency declaration, Jim Butterworth, director of the Georgia Emergency Management and Homeland Security Agency, said in a telephone interview. Tropical storm force winds seemed to dissipate quickly as Hermine moved over dry land into Georgia. "With a storm like this you absolutely can't tell until the true impact comes inland," Butterworth said. Property damage appeared to be mostly scattered reports of trees on homes and cars, Butterworth said, and a few people suffered minor injuries from cleanup efforts — including a couple of mishaps with chain-saws. The most widespread problem appeared to be power outages. More than 107,000 homes and businesses were without electricity across Georgia as crews worked to repair damage left by Hermine, utility companies reported around the lunch hour Friday. About 30,000 of them were in the Savannah area, and more than 20,000 others were in the Brunswick area near the coast, Georgia Power reported on its online outage map shortly before noon Friday. More than 11,000 customers were without power in hard-hit Lowndes County, the utility company reported. Thousands more outages were reported by the state's electric cooperatives, which cover many rural areas in south Georgia. The National Weather Service reported winds up to 55 mph tore through Valdosta and surrounding Lowndes County early Friday. Melvin Gatlin Sr., 84, of Valdosta awoke with a fright before dawn to the sound of a thundering crack that shook his whole house. "I thought somebody had shot me, the way it sounded," Gatlin said a few hours later in his living room, where a cooking pot on the floor caught water dripping from the ceiling. The storm's winds toppled a pine tree in the backyard onto Gatlin's home of more than 40 years. The trunk crushed a storage shed where Gatlin kept his deep freezer and lawn mower. It also made a tear in his roof. "Nobody got hurt," said Gatlin's son, Melvin Gatlin Jr. "That's the best part." Howling winds, falling limbs and trash cans rattling across yards kept some of Gatlin's neighbors awake overnight. "I couldn't sleep. I walked the floor," said Betty Campbell, who lives three houses away from Gatlin. Campbell watched the rain with her daughter and a friend under the shelter of her carport Friday morning. Her husband was still dozing inside. "He slept through it," Campbell said. "He told me to leave him alone."

But walmart.com isn’t typically a source for rare sneakers. But that’s exactly where one re-seller decided to sell a pair of Nike Air Yeezy 2s, in the “Red October” colorway, which are currently going for $6,499. These sneakers, originally retailed for $250, were surprise released on nike.com in February 2014. They marked West’s last collaboration with the brand before a tumultuous split, which led him to partner with Adidas. West, who will perform at Madison Square Garden for the Saint Pablo tour on Monday and Tuesday, recently launched a series of temporary stores globally that sold “Life of Pablo” merchandise. The Yeezy Season 4 collection is expected to show during New York Fashion Week on Wednesday.

It opened Friday, it’s called Greater.  But before I describe this movie to you, a little bit more on Kaepernick and developments since yesterday.  There’s a rookie linebacker for the Philadelphia Eagles named Myke Tavarres, and on Monday he said that he planned to join Kaepernick, Kaepernick ‘s protest, refused to stand during the national anthem at upcoming games in the National Football League, and then within hours changed his mind.  Now, I want to issue a — I don’t know what you call this, a message.  I just want to say something to you players of the National Football League.  The American people love your sport.  The American people respect you who have the unique human ability to play it at the level you play it.  But the American people are not going to sit by idly and watch the stage of the National Football League stolen and used for personal political purposes.  You players in the NFL, you can go ahead and try to continue stealing the stage of the NFL if you want.  You can take the example of Kaepernick and you can try to get some news coverage, you can draw attention to yourself, but you run the risk of obliterating the stage on which you perform that earns you your living and gives you the opportunity to succeed beyond your wildest dreams.  You better be careful in what and how you express your thoughts on this country, the greatest place in the history of mankind.  And the residents of this country are among the luckiest in the history of all humanity.  The National Football League is on TV.  It can easily be turned off.  The National Football League is sponsored by beer and cars and soft drinks that can easily be not purchased.  Not that hard.  Just turn it off.  You better be especially careful because the opening weekend of the National Football League this year is the 15th anniversary of 9/11.  Opening Sunday in the National Football League this year is September the 11th, the 15th anniversary.  And if a number of you endeavor to try to steal the stage of the National Football League to call attention to a personal political issue, attention you could not get without stealing the stage of the National Football League, you run the risk of doing grave damage to the league and business in which you play and are paid, a business which depends on massive public love and support and attention and money.  So you I think need to consider all of this responsibly and try to understand who your audience is and why they are watching and understand that they tune in to three hours, six hours, nine hours, however many hours on Sunday and Monday they watch, and now Thursday, to escape what they consider to be the stresses and the strains and the humdrum of their lives.  They tune in to the National Football League for a little break from the hassles of life. They tune in to the National Football League to forget all of these things that are causing controversy and divisiveness.  They want to be entertained; we want to be entertained.  We want to watch spectacular athleticism.  We want to watch the drama of competition.  We want to watch programming that has no script, therefore we have no ending, until it actually ends.  And you run the risk of destroying all that if you misplace your priorities.  Now, what helped me bring this into greater focus last night, my friend Nick Searcy, well-known Hollywood actor, said, “Hey, I got a DVD screener I want to send you.  A new movie just came out.  I have a little part in it.  It’s called Greater.”  And I said, “Nick, I’d love to watch it, but you’re gonna have to have them caption it or it’s gonna be a worthless endeavor for me.  I literally cannot understand dialogue in a movie with all the other noise, the soundtrack and whatever other things are going on, without subtitles or closed captioning.” “Don’t worry, we’ll take care of the it. The guys are gonna do it, they’re gonna do it.”  I said, “Cool.”  So I had never heard of the movie.  I didn’t know the story the movie’s about. I didn’t know anything about it.  I received the movie on Saturday and I had a chock-filled weekend and I didn’t get a chance to watch it.  So Nick sends me a note yesterday, “Did you see it? Did you see it?”  I wrote, “Sorry Nick, I haven’t had time, gonna watch it tonight.”  So last night about seven o’clock I plugged in the DVD screener, I inserted it into the tray of my DVD player and, lo and behold, there was no captioning.  So I put it on pause and I wrote Nick and said, “Look, there’s no captioning file.  And I’m gonna watch it Nick,” ’cause I watched the first five minutes of it, and I was already hooked.  I was already intrigued.  And I was really frustrated.  I was turning the volume up as loud as the house could take it. I was rewinding in 10 and 15 second bits. I got up and I stood as close to the speakers as I could to try to make out the dialogue.  And throughout the movie I was only able to pick up — I’ll betcha I didn’t get 30% of what was said, but I know this movie, I know everything in it, I know it was incredible.  I tried three different DVD players thinking, well, maybe one of them is not picking up the file.  I tried every which way I could think to get the captioning file to display, but it didn’t.  So a movie with a little over two-hour run time I spent four hours last night watching, rewinding parts that I wanted to see again.  The timing of this compared to this Kaepernick folly, the story of Brandon Burlsworth, who I had never heard of and I’m shocked that I had not heard of him. He was born in Harrison, Arkansas, a chubby kid with a father that was not a factor in his life, mother loved him dearly. He had an older brother, a brother that many people thought was his father, such was the age difference.  The kid was really chubby.  He sat on the sofa watching college football eating chips and cheese. The family chided him, made fun of him. He would watch, “I’m gonna play there someday. I’m gonna be a Razorback.”  Everybody laughed at him.  “Oh, really?  Really, Brandon, you’re gonna be a Razorback?” “Yeah, that’s gonna be me someday,” pointing to the TV.  This kid had no connections, Harrison, Arkansas.  His dad was not there.  He literally had no connections.  He had no money.  There was no way he would ever attend any university unless he could acquire a scholarship and there was no way he was gonna get a scholarship because — well, as the coach who first saw him said, “I don’t know whether to put you on life support or send you down and get you outfitted for a uniform,” he was so overweight. Because a coach had told him when he was 275 he was too small to play at Arkansas, so he started eating and got up to 330 and showed up, and they said, “No, this is not what we had in mind.”  He was a walk-on, University of Arkansas.  Today his jersey is only the second jersey retired in the history of Arkansas football.  His locker permanently ensconced in glass in the Razorback locker room.  Here are the various awards and honors and foundations started because of his achievements.  The Brandon Burlsworth foundation.  He died 11 days after being drafted by the Indianapolis Colts at age 22 in a traffic accident near his home, on his way to Indianapolis.  He was just an incredible story, incredible young man.  The Brandon Burlsworth Foundation was established after his death by family and friends in honor of his work ethic and his Christian values.  Then there’s Burls’ Kids, provides underprivileged youth a chance to attend Arkansas Razorback and Indianapolis Colts football games.  Eyes of a champion.  He lost a lot of his eyesight, had to wear giant Coke-bottle glasses underneath his helmet to play, and did.  The Eyes of a Champion program was started in 2007, and that is a program in partnership with Walmart and Sam’s optical department and the independent optometrists across Arkansas providing eye car for thousands of pre-Kindergarten to twelfth grade students.  There are Brandon Burlsworth football camps.  He won numerous scholarships.  There is the Burlsworth award. He was a walk-on. He had no connections. He had no money. He shows up at Arkansas fulfilling a dream sitting on the sofa at 8 watching Razorback football saying, “I’m gonna be there someday. That’s gonna be me someday.”  He overcame insurmountable odds, seemingly insurmountable odds.  He is the most famous walk-on success story in college football, and to this day there is a national award given to the college football player who achieves the most as a walk-on every year.  He was teased. He was ridiculed. He was bullied. He was laughed at. He was told he couldn’t do it, and he never stopped smiling.  The personality that Brandon Burlsworth had throughout all of this adversity as portrayed in this movie, which, by the way, is a multiyear project.  A lot of heart and soul has gone into the making of this movie.    Neal McDonough is the lead actor. He plays the brother, the much older brother.  You know, the thing about this, folks… I mean, what this is really is an incredible, genuinely incredible story about the values that you and I all hold dear, that we hold onto, that we to this day trust make the difference in success and failure, happiness and misery. Hard work, perseverance, competition, leadership, faith. All of that takes place in this movie with SEC football as the backdrop, because this man’s life was culminated with his success story at Arkansas.  Now, the movie opened last Friday, and it is expanding in a bunch of theaters and screens.  It practically sold out Arkansas and now it’s expanding, and here’s the thing.  I mean, there are a lot of movies with these values. There are a lot of movies that try to capitalize on what the producers think are “conservative values,” and so they throw these conservative values into a story, make a movie of it, and think that conservative people — people of faith — are gonna show up.  There’s not a single cliche in this movie.  I mean, it’s all real.  And probably because it’s based on an actual life.  It is all genuine.  There’s not a single cliche.  Now, I have to say, there was no captioning, and I missed some dialogue.  There might be some… My point here is that there’s nothing fake or phony about this man. He existed. He was real.  He was just completely unique.  And I’m telling you, the chance that… You know, I could have watched this thing on Saturday or Sunday and didn’t. The fact that I didn’t watch it ’til last night after this whole brouhaha with Colin Kaepernick and all the people speaking about what a great, brave thing he’s doing? That’s folly compared to the story of Brandon Burlsworth.  Maybe the cliche is somebody taken way, way before their time. Why does…? Why do bad things happen to good people? I mean, you can’t help but be moved by this.  It isn’t… It could have been cheesy; it isn’t.  It’s inspiring.  This is the backbone of America. When I describe that on this program, talking to you about the people who make this country work, it’s things like this that I have in mind. It’s people that come from places in the country you’ve not heard of, who are just out living and trying to do the best they can.  No connections, no networking. Nobody knew anybody. Nobody in his family knew anybody to call at Arkansas.  You had to earn every step of it.  Now, he plugged away at it, almost didn’t make it a couple of times, and you have to allow that I may have missed some of it ’cause I didn’t get all of the dialogue. So I can’t for certain say he had no connections.  My impression watching this and hearing what I was able to hear and the portrayal of the father makes me pretty confident in saying that this was all the result of perseverance.  Not to belittle connections, by the way.  Don’t misunderstand here.   BREAK TRANSCRIPT RUSH:  The name of the movie, the title of the movie is Greater. One word: Greater.  I have to tell you, I watched the movie last night, and I can’t believe that I had not heard of Brandon Burlsworth or the story.  You know me: I’m the most informed man in America.  But I’m not a college football devotee, so that may be it.  But I stopped short in listing some of the awards.  There’s the Brandon Burlsworth Award given out to a male or female at Harrison High School and the University of Arkansas.  There’s the Burlsworth Trophy created in 2010 named in his honor.  It’s given yearly to the most outstanding Division I college football player who began his career as a walk-on.  There were numerous foundations and charities associated with the — ah, not disabilities, but the — challenges that Burlsworth had to overcome to succeed.  Now, it wouldn’t be what it is if all there was was athletic achievement, which is phenomenal. But it was the kind of person he was.  By the way, he was a person of faith.  But they don’t preach to you in the movie.  I mean, it’s not beaten into you.  It’s just portrayed as it was a part of his and his family’s life.  But it’s genuinely inspirational, it is genuinely uplifting, and it provides such a contrast.  The events of the movie take place in the 1997 to 1999 era, and it’ll give you hope that such values and so forth may one day dominate yet again.  It shows their value, and the fact that the young man was a uniquely special individual is why all of this has happened, not just the athletic success and achievement — which, in itself, was phenomenal, given all the obstacles he had to overcome.  So I just wanted to share this with you, because the movie opened Friday, and it’s — you know, they’re hoping for the Labor Day weekend, and they deserve it.  It’s really, really well done.  The name of the movie is Greater.  I’m gonna take a brief time-out now.  We’ll come back, and we will deftly swerve into the other news of the day.  For example, John Kerry (who served in Vietnam) saying that the media ought to stop covering terrorism so much.  It would upset people less.  Or something like that. BREAK TRANSCRIPT RUSH: I got a bunch of emails here — by the way, the new email address, ElRushbo@eibnet.us.  No longer dot-com.  You send it there, it’s gonna end up in the ether.  Nobody will ever see it.  It will have the equivalent of becoming invisible ink before it explodes out there.  So use ElRushbo@eibnet.us.  I got a great email note here.  “Rush, you forgot something in your monologue about the NFL and Kaepernick.”  And the emailer is right.  Let me read this to you.  “Listening to your analysis of potential jeopardy for the NFL if the player’s socially conscious behavior ends up alienating fans and viewers.  I know why, Rush, but what you didn’t say is the NFL only has itself to blame.  It was the NFL that sponsored their own Hispanic week.  It’s the NFL that goes all pink in the month of October for breast cancer in order to make themselves look socially aware.  “And, as you well know, Rush, as a sports expert, once you bring social consciousness to the field, where does it stop?  Once you open that door and you are the NFL, how do you tell other people not to do it?  ‘Hands up, don’t shoot,’ the St. Louis Rams, ‘I can’t breathe’ on T-shirts, sitting out the national anthem, how long do you think it’s gonna be, Rush, before college and high school players start sitting out the anthem?  “What better way to become nationally known?  Why, you can get the same kind of attention and fame that Colin Kaepernick is getting, and all you’ve gotta do is sit on your butt during the national anthem.  You nailed it, superb, Rushbo, but this is just the beginning, and the NFL itself opened the door.”  I have to say that this guy has a point here.  But it is the NFL, and it’s their stage.  Regardless, if this stuff keeps up, look, my point remains the same.  People’s tolerance for social issues is immense, people’s emotional reservoirs, but there’s a limit. And I’m telling you, people turn on the National Football League or watch any other thing on TV or sports to get away from whatever they may consider to be the humdrum of their life.  They don’t want to be preached to.  It’s the same reason why political statement movies bomb.  That’s not why people go to the movies, and I guarantee you people are not turning on the TV to watch players, third string, about-to-be-cut players, making an issue of disrespecting the national anthem and the country.  That’s not why they tune in.  You’re gonna have a couple. You’re gonna have some people, a percentage, “Wow, this is great. This is controversy, man.” You’re gonna have that, but people who watch the NFL for other reasons who still love the country, and I trust that it’s a greater number than 50% of Americans still love the country, are not gonna find a lot of tolerance for this.  And then the more the social activists pipe up and start talking about how brilliant these protests are and how we ought to sit back and pay attention. We better listen and we better notice and we better understand, and we better understand why people hate this country. We better get with it fast. We better understand why and we better be ready to accept whatever demands they make to change this country, that’s fine and dandy, but not on Sunday afternoon.  It’s too easy to turn the TV off.  It’s too easy not to buy the latest beer or soft drink.  It’s too easy not to go out and buy sports jerseys and paraphernalia and that kind of thing, and it’s really very easy to say, “You know what?  I’m not gonna put up with the trek to the stadium and the traffic and all that.”  So I just think everybody ought to be careful.  BREAK TRANSCRIPT RUSH: This movie that I talked about an hour ago in the opening monologue of the program, the movie Greater, I really hope as many of you who have a chance to see it do so.  I don’t want to overdo it.  I mean, I don’t want to build up expectations to the point that you watch it and are disappointed, so I’m just gonna stop.  I’m just telling you that it’s just beautiful, and it is so timely, and it is so inspirational.  And it makes you wish that the values and the behavior and the quest for excellence and greatness was dominant in our culture.  And, you know, it may still be, it just isn’t covered.  It’s just heartwarming.  You’ll have every emotion, you’ll go through every emotion, the gamut.  But what I think we’re gonna do tomorrow, we’re gonna get Neal McDonough, who was the star, the male lead. He was in Justified. He’s in Suits right now. He’s a great actor, and he plays the older brother of Brandon Burlsworth in the movie. I think Buck Sexton, our guest host tomorrow, Buck from the CIA is gonna have them on to discuss the movie from their perspective, even better.  Snerdley is setting that up.  You know, we don’t do this much.  We don’t have bookers and guests, well, unless the guest hosts do that, which I, of course, am not ever told about.  But Snerdley is putting that together.  So when we get that ironed out, I’ll make sure that you know.  McDonough was executive producer of the movie, so he wasn’t just an actor taking the role.  I think he’s got a lot of — well, he’s into it.  The movie is something I think he wanted to be a part of.   Related Links RushLimbaugh.com: The Many Reasons Behind the NFL Ratings Decline - 09.30.16 RushLimbaugh.com: The NFL Ignored My Warning -- and the TV Ratings Are Plummeting - 09.21.16 RushLimbaugh.com: The NFL Backlash Begins - 09.13.16 RushLimbaugh.com: Liberalism Is Killing the NFL - 09.09.16 RushLimbaugh.com: Fox on Your Host and Kaepernick - 08.30.16 RushLimbaugh.com: My Response to Colin Kaepernick - 08.29.16 RushLimbaugh.com: Nick Searcy "Renounces" Conservatism - 02.19.15 USAToday: Eagles Rookie Reverses Course, Won't Sit in Protest During National Anthem Greater: The Story of The Greatest Walk-On In College Football ____________ ARCHIVES CALENDAR August 2016 M T W T F S S « Jul   Sep » 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31   Pin It on Pinterest Share This Facebook Twitter Google+ Pinterest LinkedIn         RushLimbaugh.com - © 2017 Premiere Radio Networks.

Posted by Laura Wittmannon September 2, 2016· 3 Comments Welcome! Simplify your blog reading and don't miss a post by subscribing to my blog via email (choose to get daily or weekly updates delivered right to your inbox). Hi friends, happy Friday to you!  It’s fall y’all, well here in northern Alberta, Canada it is. Oh my I’ve already dug out my slippers and blue jeans. Not sure how I feel about that…I do love the coziness of fall but summer just seemed to go by way too quick this year. Oreck Air Refresh: One of my favorite parts of fall is filling my home with delicious cozy scents. But first I must take out the yucky smells using my Oreck Air Refresh 2-in-1 Purifier and Humidifier. Oreck is a blog partner of mine and when they sent me this machine I was a little skeptical but I’ve been really happy with how well it works. I use mine in our kitchen because on my Paleo diet I eat a lot of seafood and it makes my family crazy with the smell (I’m the only one that eats it). The Oreck Air Refresh does a fantastic job of taking those yucky smells away. It uses a 2-stage filtration with the Hepa media filter capturing 99% of airborne particles and the charcoal odor-reducing filter working to remove the odors from the environment. It also has a humidifier as well with a built-in humidistat that automatically switches on/off to ensure the desired humidity level is maintained. I really love how quiet it is too. Grandma’s Kitchen: One of my favorite fall scents right now is Grandma’s Kitchen in the Crossroads Crumbles that I melt in my plug-in burner from Walmart. It’s cinnamony and delicious. I can leave it running all day and don’t have to worry about forgetting to blow it out when I leave the house like I would with candles. Isn’t it pretty? Over the Cabinet Towel Bar: Another favorite I wanted to share with you here (I already shared it over on Instagram, come follow me there) are these over the cabinet towel bars. You can buy them at places like Bed Bath and Beyond and Winners (Marshalls) but I just saw that they have them at Dollarama too. They are perfect for hanging your cleaning supplies on in the inside of kitchen or bathroom cabinet. Smart, right? :) Favorite Organizing Links: I always like to share a few of my favorite organizing links when I do these Friday favorite posts. There is just so much awesomeness out there in blogland that it would be rude not to share it :) How Getting Rid of My Stuff Saved My Motherhood ~ @ The Balanced Life Studies show a direct link between the amount of physical possessions in a house and the stress level of the female homeowner. One study done at UCLA found that the more stuff was in a woman’s house, the higher her level of stress hormones. This same study also found that women subconsciously relate how happy they are with their home-life and family to how they feel about their homes. So the more clutter and chaos in the home, the less happy the woman is with her family and her life. A Sweet FREE Planner for September (including a menu planning gage) ~ @ Shining Mom Free September Goal Setting Printables ~ @ Planning Inspired 10 Essential Moving Tips When You’ve Got Little Kids Underfoot ~ @ Kayse Pratt 4 Signs You’ve Become Clutter Blind ~ @ My Love for Words I don’t think clutter blindness necessarily means the clutter doesn’t bother someone; it’s simply that they’ve grown so used to it that there’s no real urgency in cleaning it up. It starts to blend in with your home, and you don’t really see it anymore so instead of clearing your kitchen counter, you push everything over to prep your meals. Instead of putting books on a shelf or sorting mail, you create piles to be dealt with later. Instead of unpacking a suitcase from your most recent trip (that may not have been “recent” at all), you shove it just out of the way enough that it doesn’t really affect your day to day life. That’s clutter blindness. Have a super weekend everyone and make sure you take some time for decluttering and organizing!!

Would love some in site with getting it organized and routines to keep it that way. Thanks a bunch. Reply 2Becky L says September 4, 2016 The clutter blindness info was interesting but so true. Yep, I’m working on my clutter. Always, especially this weekend. Never ending process but makes me feel much better with less stuff around! It’s cooler here in Oregon these past few days. NO rain as of yet but it did rain some Wed. Will still need to water my potted plants and tomatoes that are coming to the end of season. So delicious and will plant some again next year. It is sweater wearing, long pants wearing season again, thankfully. I need to get a pair of short fuzzy boots again this fall.

Follow Raw Story! Follow @rawstory An Alabama man was arrested after responding to a woman’s offer of help with racial threats and shotgun threats. Christopher Joseph Lucier was spotted earlier this week attempting to push his vehicle into the parking lot of a Wal-Mart store in Ozark, reported the Dothan Eagle. A woman offered to help Lucier push the vehicle into the parking lot — and police said he apparently became enraged. Lucier responded to the offer by screaming racial slurs and grabbing a shotgun from his vehicle, witnesses said. He then threatened to kill bystanders as the woman backed away from him and waited for police to arrive. Officers ordered Lucier down to the ground, and police used a Taser to subdue him and take him into custody. Lucier was charged with a felony count of terroristic threatening and misdemeanor counts of public intoxication and obstruction of government operations. He was jailed on $12,000 bond.

Kylee Clifton was originally arrested at Placerville’s Walmart on suspicion of being under the influence of a controlled substance, possession of drug paraphernalia, theft and giving false information to an officer on Aug. 28. She was considered a “low-risk inmate at the El Dorado County Jail” and was taken to Marshall Hospital for treatment of an undisclosed ailment. “Based on the charges Clifton was facing, she met the criteria established by state law to remain at the hospital unguarded. The applicable Penal Code Sections (4011.7 and 4011.9) allow for prisoners that do not constitute a danger to life or property to have their guard removed,” states a sheriff’s department press release “These inmates sign a form that clearly indicates that if they do walk away from the hospital, they face additional charges up to and including felony escape.” Sheriff’s deputies immediately began searching for Clifton and put the word out on social media after she disappeared from the hospital just after 4 p.m. on Aug. 30. She was taken into custody and back in the Placerville jail by Wednesday morning. As of press time yesterday Clifton remained in custody in lieu of $15,000 bail. She now faces additional charges for allegedly escaping from custody.

(AP Photo/Luca Bruno) CTV Kitchener Published Friday, September 2, 2016 12:25PM EDT We’re less than two months from seeing wine for sale on the shelves of Ontario grocery stores. On Oct. 28, as many as 70 stores across the province will be able to legally stock and sell wine. Friday, the province released a list of supermarket operators that had won licences to be among those 70 stores through a bidding process. They include industry leaders Walmart, Loblaws, Sobeys and Metro, as well as a number of smaller players including Farm Boy and a number of companies concentrated around the Greater Toronto Area. It is not yet known which individual stores in those chains will be offering wine for sale. According to the province, wine sales will eventually be expanded to 300 grocery stores. Since some Ontario grocery stores were first allowed to sell beer last December, an estimated $24 million worth of beer has been purchased by those stores.

Privacy laws prohibit the hospital from releasing the condition of John Sanchez who, according to police, was badly hurt with internal injuries and broken bones after allegedly running off from store employees in relation to a shoplifting incident. According to Lt. James MacIntosh, Sanchez was seen running to the back parking lot at 9:30 p.m. Friday and jumping a fence with a drop-off of 20 to 100 feet. Patrolmen Mike Reilly and Kyle Parrill checked the surrounding area, and then climbed down the wooded area below the fence. They walked several hundred feet to check the area, and Sanchez was located at the base of the high retaining wall below the fence. He was on his back and unconscious. The Pompton Lakes Riverdale First Aid Squad, paramedics, and the Riverdale Fire Department were all contacted, along with the State Police's NorthSTAR medevac helicopter. Sanchez was extracted from the area and taken to a landing zone where he was loaded onto the helicopter. According to MacIntosh, police learned that Sanchez had attempted to take a cart full of $462.58 in merchandise from the Walmart, which is located at 48 Route 23 North. Sgt. Chuck Quant charged Sanchez with fourth-degree shoplifting. He will be processed and given a court date when he is released from St. Joe's.

You're not alone. Consumer demand for organically produced food is growing, with total U.S. sales in the category rising 11 percent to $43.3 billion last year, according to the Organic Trade Association. Annie's Homegrown, a California-based company that specializes in affordable organic products, is slated to launch 30 new certified organic products this year, from cereal to soup. However, prices for products can still seem too high for some consumers. "It's a major concern for people," Kate Brown, founder of organic soup company Boulder Organic, told CNBC. "I think a lot of times it's one of the major mental obstacles for people. They just think it's too expensive [and] out of their reach." Brown is just one of many chefs and business owners who say you don't have to clean out your wallet to eat clean. "It's a big misconception," said, Kristina Addington, a vegan chef who won an episode of Food Network's "Cutthroat Kitchen" in 2014. "If you like to cook a lot and you switch to a plant-based lifestyle, it's probably not going to be any more expensive. You will probably be spending the same amount of money, you'll just be buying slightly different things." Unlike conventional food, organic products are produced without any pesticides or fertilizers, which has traditionally resulted in high costs, Karan Chechi, a research director with TechSci Research consulting firm, said in a statement. "To curb this concern, global organic food manufacturers are working towards reducing the existing price difference between organic and inorganic food." Indeed, organic products have become more widely available and don't require shoppers to go to specialty shops. Nearly three out of four conventional grocery stores carry clean products, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Wal-Mart, Target and Kroger have all begun stocking up on organic food, in a push to rival higher-price grocery chains like Whole Foods Market. And by introducing their own private label brands, retailers are able to sell organic products at an even lower price. Source: Boulder Organic In addition to shopping at lower-price stores, there are other steps consumers can take to eat organic for less. Brown suggests people stop spending their disposable income at coffee shops and start making coffee, smoothies and granola at home to further curb the cost of swapping to an organic lifestyle. "Check the bulk bins," Addington suggested. "It's so much cheaper to get beans, rice, lentils, flours and grains there." Addington noted that shopping from these bins allows customers to choose how much of a product they want and leads to less food waste. Another way to reduce food waste is to plan meals ahead of time. "Planning ahead is so important," Brown said. "You waste less if you have a plan for that ingredient." It also means fewer trips to the store. Brown said she shops for food about once every week and a half. The average shopper goes to the grocery store about 1.6 times per week, according to the Food Marketing Institute. Cutting fruits and vegetables at home and placing them into containers or bags is another way to prevent food waste, Brown said. Canning, freezing and drying are other alternatives to keeping food fresh longer and reducing waste. Consumers new to an organic diet can try meal delivery services to learn recipes and practice cooking with clean ingredients. One such company is Addington's vegan meal delivery service V-Grits, which uses organic ingredients. It teaches consumers how to eat vegan using plant-based ingredients that are easy to find in stores, making recreating recipes very easy. The program provides ingredients for three meals a week and costs $69. Folks can expect to see dishes like southern style enchiladas, vegan chili and quiche-stuffed peppers. Other organic meal services include companies like Green Chef and Provenance Meals. These services can cost between $45 and $325 depending on how many meals a week are provided. "I would encourage people to recalibrate their palates," Brown said. "And see what whole ingredients taste like without Velveeta on them." Brown suggests consumers experiment with different organic foods by "making it a fun, social" experience. Gathering friends together to make meals or having an organic potluck can help folks who want to eat cleaner try a variety of dishes, and find recipes to recreate in the future. The easiest way to break into an organic diet? Knowing that you don't have to eat organic all the time. Paige Wolf, author of "Spit That Out," a book that focuses on how to raise children in an "age of environmental guilt," said she keeps her home about 90 percent organic, and doesn't fret about what her children eat at friends' birthday parties or the occasional nonorganic treat. Instead, she focuses on providing organic foods at home and for school lunches. "Kids are super picky eaters. My son eats mac 'n' cheese, grilled cheese, and peanut butter and jelly. I can't do much about the variety, but I can make it organic," she said. And, of course, consumers should look for coupons for organic brands as a way to cut costs. "I don't eat organic 100 percent of the time," Wolf said. "If my kids want ice cream, we'll still go to Baskin-Robbins."

Young Kanye West’s Air Yeezy 2 for Sale on Walmart.com A sneaker reseller has opted for an unlikely platform to sell a pair of Nike Air Yeezy 2s. By Aria Hughes on September 2, 2016 Share This Article Reddit LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Print Talk Kanye West at the fall Yeezy runway show. Bailey Jr./BFA/REX/Shutterstock BARGAIN BASEMENT: It’s not uncommon to see a pair of Kanye West sneakers — whether produced by Adidas or Nike — on a site like eBay or Stadium Goods. But walmart.com isn’t typically a source for rare sneakers. But that’s exactly where one reseller decided to sell a pair of Nike Air Yeezy 2s, in the “Red October” colorway, which are currently going for $6,499. These sneakers, originally retailed for $250, were surprise released on nike.com in February 2014. They marked West’s last collaboration with the brand before a tumultuous split, which led him to partner with Adidas. West, who will perform at Madison Square Garden for the Saint Pablo tour on Monday and Tuesday, recently launched a series of temporary stores globally that sold “Life of Pablo” merchandise. The Yeezy Season 4 collection is expected to show during New York Fashion Week on Wednesday. You're missing something! Activate your FREE PREVIEW now.

In this report, Technavio covers the market outlook and growth prospects of the global physical security marketin the retail sectorfor 2016-2020. The market is further categorized into three segments by type, including EAS (electronic article surveillance), video surveillance systems, and access control and intruder alarm system, of which the EAS market in retail sector will grow at a CAGR of 7% by 2020. "The global retail market will grow significantly during the forecast period, driven by the discount, dollar store, food, and service retail concepts. Restaurants will be the strongest category in terms of overall unit growth among all retail concepts. The demand for physical security deployments will increase in line with the significant growth in the global retail industry," says Amrita Choudhury, a lead IT security research analyst from Technavio. Technavio's research study segments the global physical security market in the retail sectorinto the following regions: Americas APAC EMEA In 2015, with a market share of 47%, the Americas dominated the global physical security market in retail sector, followed by EMEA with 38% and APAC with 15%. Americas: largest physical security market in retail sector By 2020, the physical security market in retail sector in the Americas will account for a market share of over 46%, growing at a CAGR of over 6%. Though the market share of the Americas region is decreasing, the market is likely to have increased demand for security solutions because of growth in the number of retail stores and facilities. Several international retailers are expanding in the US. Wal-Mart Stores, a multinational retail corporation that owns and operates a chain of retail stores in different formats such as restaurants, supermarkets, apparel stores, discount stores, drug stores, and hypermarkets, is also planning to expand its business in different locations across the Americas. US retailers are using several tools to combat retail shrinks, such as video surveillance, alarm monitoring, and security guards. The most common solutions in the country to protect merchandise are EAS, security keepers, and advanced inventory control tactics. "The US is one of the most advanced retail markets globally, with significant amounts of retail spending, and the market is attracting international retailers. The portal cities of New York City, San Francisco, Miami, Chicago, and Los Angeles have the presence of most global brands," says Amrita. Ask sample report: http://goo.gl/31RRLf Increasing awareness about retail shop security fueling the market in EMEA The physical security market in retail sector in EMEA will account for a market share of over 38% by 2020, growing at a CAGR of nearly 7%. The Middle Eastern cities such as Dubai, Kuwait, Abu Dhabi, Jeddah, and Riyadh are emerging as business and travel hubs, and they are attracting more global retail brands. The cities' strong in-place tourism helps increase the flow of foreign money. The cities have affordable retail space, supported by franchise structures, which are feasible options for international retailers. In addition, the international brands can enter into the Middle East's retail market without too much competition from domestic brands, because the domestic retail market is not as mature compared to other regions. Furthermore, the quickening pace of recovery in many of traditional European markets is evident to both the adaptability of the many retail partners such as SPAR. Recovery in European markets had gathered pace with strong retail sales growth reported by SPAR Austria, SPAR Belgium, and SPAR Hungary. Among the African countries, Nigeria was the second-largest market for video surveillance systems in the Sub-Saharan region after South Africa in 2015. APAC to post a CAGR of more than 7% during the period 2016-2020 The physical security market in retail sector in APAC will account for a market share of above 15% by 2020. The revenue of the market is expected to increase because of the rapid growth in the retail sector across APAC. Asia is always an attractive region for international retailers, and it is evident from the global retail development index 2015 for countries like China, India, Mongolia, and Malaysia. Additionally, India is benefiting from its the economic stability and regulatory reforms, which are aimed at improving ease of doing business. China's number one spot in the list is due to the shift in the economy from an infrastructure investment-driven model to consumer consumption model. The growing middle class coupled with the relaxation of one-child policy will boost consumer spending in the country, leading to higher retail market growth during the forecast period. With the rise in the number of international retail chains entering the local market, the adoption of security solutions to prevent inventory shrinkage has increased. This is expected to create awareness about the requirement of security solutions among the local retail stores.

Though this new strain of feminism is worth considering as a symbolic gesture for women, it lacks the practical momentum necessary for inclusivity and material equality. Unfortunately, it breeds more sinister implications. It illustrates the evolution of feminism as the tool for meaningful change to the tokenization of empowerment. In a piece about Facebook’s COO Sheryl Sandberg, columnist Jessica Valenti validly points out that it is shortsighted to assume that success contradicts feminism. Though Sandberg’s feminist brand reeks of the classic bootstraps-uplift narrative, she also rightfully addresses issues such as paid maternity leave and affordable child care. Still, Sandberg’s brand of feminism, which takes on the tone of a motivational exercise program, is problematic and should be critiqued. In a TED talk, she lists the means to stay in the workforce as follows: sit at the table, make your partner a real partner and don’t leave before you leave. Corporate feminism prioritizes the climb to the top, emphasizing assertiveness and negotiation in the workplace. But it fails to hold elected officials responsible for institutionalized change that helps women who aren’t at the top. Though success is not a bad thing, it is myopic, even contradictory, to reserve feminism for privileged women. So what happens when activists prioritize branding? They downplay the importance of policy for uncritical, often expensive, gatherings and capitalize on the grandiose rhetoric of “empowerment” and “human rights.” Over the last few decades, feminist grassroots gatherings evolved into what Jessica Bennett calls star-studded events with corporate sponsors such as Wal-Mart, a multinational notorious for its poor labor practices. Unsurprisingly, tickets at conferences like TEDWomen cost around $1,000, coming with lavish catalogue-order gift bags. In the virtual world, Lean In, Sandberg’s organization, takes advantage of superficial success stories. For example, it features Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen on its Tumblr page, ignoring her poor track record for women’s rights. As a representative, Ros-Lehtinen voted to withdraw funding from organizations such as Planned Parenthood and Title X. She also voted against the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which gave women the ability to sue over equal-pay violations. Yes, she is a successful woman, but is she a women’s advocate? No. Capitalistic feminism quiets conversations that aren’t novel or marketable. Valenti herself writes that conferences like TEDWomen, an epicenter for do-good white, upper-class feminists, avoid critical issues such as abortion. In response to comments about the lack of abortion talks, TEDWomen co-host Kelly Stoetzel evasively replied that abortion was not a “wider issue of justice, inequality and human rights,” citing abortion as “more of a topical issue.” Last year, 22 states passed 70 anti-abortion measures, which included doctor and clinic regulations, limits on medication abortion and bans on insurance coverage of abortion. But abortion issues aren’t unique to the United States — a study in 2013 reported that about 26 percent of the world generally prohibits abortions. When governments pass laws over how women should conduct their bodies, it is most certainly an issue of “justice, inequality and human rights.” Elite empowerment feminism further overlooks crucial nodes of identity such as race and class. Last Wednesday, The Curve, a blog on the Nation, released an article titled “Does feminism have a class problem?” Indeed it does. While the article underplays the cultural underpinnings of patriarchy, it fairly critiques Lean In, pointing out that the problem of sexism is structural, not personal. It argues that icons such as Sandberg address women who are advancing in their careers, rather than women who are struggling to keep and find economically sustainable jobs. In 2012, 7.1 million working families with children in the United States were headed by women, and of this number, 58 percent were low income. In the same year, women made 77 cents to every  dollar that men made. The numbers are more drastic for women of color. For every dollar that white men made, Latina women made 54 cents and African American women made 64 cents. The downfall of elite empowerment is that not all women have the same starting position. Rawls’ veil of ignorance — minus the patriarchal language — casts a valuable framework for understanding this. Under the veil at the original position, no one knows his or her place in society, class position, natural assets, abilities, etc. Here, people must decide the society they would choose. To ensure fairness of opportunity, Rawls proposed the difference principle, in which inequality of the distribution of goods would be tolerated as long as those inequalities benefited the least well-off. To translate into terms of policy, the Curve suggests that raising the pay floor to $25,000 would help more than 3 million female retail workers. Half of these women make less than this amount a year, and one-third of them work for more than half of their household income and have children. The brand of “empowerment” is not only prevalent in the United States but also in other countries. A few weeks ago, the Cambodian anti-sex trafficking activist Somaly Mam stepped down from her eponymous foundation after Simon Marks released an expose in Newsweek about Mam’s dishonesty in her personal narrative as an alleged former victim of trafficking and how she forced girls in her organization to reiterate crafted stories of trafficking. One might ask what the role of money has to play in this scenario. Ever since Mam brought attention to the issue of trafficking, NGOs have appeared, creating jobs for women. Jobs are good — but these jobs are at garment factories with poor working conditions and compensation. Of the 350,000 garment workers in Cambodia, 90 percent are women and make on average two-thirds below a living wage. Seventy percent of the clothes go to the United States. This is hard to swallow, considering how corporations such as Nike, which thrive on cheap labor, funded the film Half the Sky, a film by Nicholas Kristof that featured Somaly Mam. It is further unsettling to think about how Kristof has branded and capitalized upon the structural violence against young women. Kristof and Mam seek to “empower” women and make the task of “freeing” women seem simple. But how can they be empowered without a living wage? As Marx contends, we ascend from Earth to heaven — not the other way around. The call for female workplace assertiveness and the brand of “empowerment” are banal at best. They assume simple solutions and dilute political complications. But difficult problems require complex solutions. Feel-good trickle-down feminism that preserves the cult of unregulated capitalism isn’t enough. Contact Stacey Nguyen at [email protected] and follow her on Twitter @staceytnguyen.

Fuzzagi Yes.. yes it is. fromaway05 Women CAN have it all as long as someone else foots the bill. jefflewis Adult women are not children. If you do any hard factual research and not listen to the government, media, and anti-prostitution groups, you will find that the victims of sex trafficking are mostly adult consensual prostitutes. Doing sex work of their own free will. The police and government will say the women are victims, but the women prostitutes won’t say they are victims, because there are not! The police and government won’t believe them and will force them to be “rescued” which means forcing them to do whatever the government tells them to do. So it is actually the government who are forcing the prostitutes. Prostitution is a business between adults and in our society adults are responsible for themselves. Sex slavery is just that, slavery and it’s non-consensual. “To equate the two is to say grown women aren’t capable of being responsible and making decisions for themselves. That is pretty insulting to women don’t you think?” Adult women are not children. jefflewis Is U.S. Foreign policy on Sex Trafficking based on the lies of Somaly Mam? Is anyone talking about the huge influence Somaly Mam, Nicholas Kristof and Chong Kim – the Sex Trafficking liars may have had on US foreign policy with Sex Trafficking? Every year the TIP report demands countries find victims and traffickers but what if the constant demand to find more and more is based on this media distortion and they really aren’t there to find. American citizens and Congress are all deceived over what may be a faux-issue. Somaly Mam is not the only one who has exaggerated, but is the one seen with President Obama and Hillary Clinton when she was Sec State. With current Sec of State John Kerry, Obama’s wife – Michelle Obama, and with The Queen of Spain. For me this is the real issue. The TIP program is no more than Modern Day Imperialism. What has happened to that old concept of national sovereignty? Is U.S. Foreign policy on Sex Trafficking based on the lies of Somaly Mam? jefflewis When it comes to Somaly Mam and Sex trafficking the only people the media speak with are the anti-sex trafficking organizations or zealous politicians and no one else. This is a biased one-sided conversation. The media will never question, check or research any of the claims that these groups make. Always taking their word for it and never once researching or questioning their statistics or anything they say. This results in misleading and false reporting by the media and news organizations. Prostitutes are NOT forced! They do sex work of their own free will. The media, NGO’s and government officials will never admit this or ask the sex workers rights groups or prostitutes themselves about the sex industry. When a Anti-sex trafficking group states that millions of underage children (only girls, since boys are never included) are raped, forced, and kidnapped against their will into prostitution by evil men -Why doesn’t the reporter ask: What makes you think that? Where is the proof, and evidence?, can you prove it? Or do you just think that? Can you prove they are forced against their will, raped, kidnapped and beaten? Or do you just think and assume that? Can you prove that they were underage? Or do you just think they “look” young because they are petite and skinny? What makes you think that they were raped and forced? Can you prove it? Or do you just “think” that. Where did you get those stats on the number of forced victims? What are your sources? Where did your source come up with that information? What was the methodology? How did your sources get those numbers? What study did they use? Why don’t you ever talk about transgender people, boys, men? Are all the victims young girls? Why don’t the reporters ever ask these questions? Here are some good websites about Sex Trafficking: http://bebopper76.wordpress.com/ http://humantraffickingstatistics.wordpress.com/ Tracheal There are no heated debates allowed to test the validity of bigoted, reverse-sexist, female-supremacist academic fascism (feminism).

One Toys That Were Revealed Today James Whitbrook Sep 3, 2016, 12:00am ⋅ Filed to:  io9 rogue one rogue one a star wars story star wars Toys Share The swathe of Rogue One toys that will be coming to peril your cash savings before the movie releases this December has been revealed. Want to know what'll be tickling your wallet till all its cash comes out when it comes to Rogue One? Here's what we've seen so far. 3.75" Action Figures The bread and butter of your Star Wars toy line are always going to be action figures, and Rogue One is no exception. In this years' Hasbro line of five-points-of-articulation figures ($US8 ($11) each), there's a mix of characters from The Force Awakens, and Star Wars Rebels, but if you're looking just for Rogue, there's figures of Jyn Erso, K-2SO, a Stormtrooper, and an Imperial Ground Crewman. Want to see more? We have a first look right here. Ships and Vehicles Those figures have got to fly in something, right? For Rebels, there's the U-Wing ($US50 ($66)) complete with a Cassian Andor figure, and for the Empire there's the new TIE Striker ($US40 ($53)), complete with a TIE pilot that's in scale with the other 3.75" toys. If you want to spend some major bucks, though, then the new remote-controlled AT-ACT might be up your street for a hefty price tag ($US300 ($397)). Controllable by remote or through a smart device, the AT-ACT stomps around, plays lights and sounds, and moves its head. It can also open up its cargo hold to store extra figures, and comes with figures of Jyn Erso, an AT-ACT driver, and an Astromech droid. Black Series Action Figures If you want something a bit bigger or a bit more poseable, the collector — oriented Black Series is getting a new wave of 6" toys ($US20 ($26) each) that includes a mix of Rogue One and The Force Awakens characters. From Rogue One there's Jyn Erso, Cassian Andor, K-2SO, and the Imperial Death Trooper. Funko Pop Vinyls It wouldn't be a merchandise launch in the 2010s without an army of Funko Pops turning everything they can into tiny little big-headed figures. There are 17 coming out ($US10 ($13) each), including several variants exclusive to places like Target, Walmart, Hot Topic, and more. You can see all of them here. Elite Series The Disney Store's exclusive line of die-cast metal action figures is back after its debut last year, and will pretty much be the only line you can get the entirety of the main Rogue One team come September 30th. Included in the articulated line ($US27 ($36) each) are Jyn, Cassian, Chirrut, Baze, Bohdi, and K-2SO, as well as the Deathtrooper and an Imperial Astromech. Lego Lego and Star Wars go together like peanut butter and jelly, and Rogue One will be continuing that tradition of bricks in the galaxy far, far away. There'll be five Lego sets — the Imperial Assault Hovertank ($US30 ($40)), AT-ST ($US40 ($53)), TIE Striker, ($US70 ($93)), U-Wing ($US80 ($106)), and Director Krennic's Shuttle ($US90 ($119)) — and three "Constraction" buildable figures of Jyn Erso, K-2SO, and the Deathtrooper ($US24.99 ($33) each). If you want to see pictures of every set, our friends over at Kotaku have got pictures of 'em all. While it's not technically a Rogue One set, Lego has also announced their humongous Death Star playset ($US500 ($662)) as well. A refresh of its original Death Star release rather than a new model, the 4,016-piece set comes with 23 minifigures allowing you to recreate scenes from A New Hope and Return of the Jedi in the different areas of the gigantic lego sphere of doom. Roleplaying Toys If you prefer your toys of the "pretend to shoot stormtroopers all day" variety, then there's a ton of roleplay toys coming out for the movie. Nerf is releasing blasters based on Cassian ($US20 ($26)), the Deathtrooper ($US35 ($46)), and Jyn's ($US50 ($66)) weapons that shoot LED-infused darts to make it look like you're actually pew-pewing out some blaster fire across your home/office. Check out more pictures here in our exclusive gallery. If you want to splash a bit more cash, you could pretend to be a Stormtrooper yourself with this Black Series talking helmet ($US80 ($106)). This highly detailed replica of the classic Stormtrooper helmet should fit most adults, and also has a voice masker so you can pretend to be one of the faceless drones of the Imperial armed forces to your hearts content. If that's a bit rich for you, there's a smaller half-mask of the Deathtrooper ($US27 ($36)) available exclusively at Disney Stores, but it also comes with voice-changing features. Big Figs 3.75" and 6" too small for you? Then Jakks Pacific has you covered with these plus-sized figures of Jyn Erso and a Stormtrooper, both clocking in at an impressively large 20" ($US20 ($26) each). Like the smallest figures, they have five points of articulation, but are big and sturdy enough to handle the roughest play sessions for a kid. If that's too big, you can compromise with 12" tall versions of Jyn and the Deathtrooper ($US10 ($13) each). Hot Wheels Mattel will be releasing small models of a few of the ships from the film as part of their Star Wars Hot Wheels line. There'll be a U-Wing ($US5 ($7)) and a two-pack featuring an X-Wing and a battle-damaged version of the new TIE Striker ($US10 ($13)). If you'd prefer your Star Wars characters turned into souped-up cars however, there's also a two pack of Stormtrooper- and Deathtrooper-themed Hot Wheels ($US8 ($11)). Figuarts Finally, over in Japan Bandai will be releasing multiple Rogue One characters in its hyper-articulated Figurarts line alongside familiar favourites like Han Solo in A New Hope, and a new version of Kylo Ren without his mask on. The Rogue One figures all have an Imperial theme (even if one of them is actually an ex-Imperial) — there'll be 6" figures of the Shoretrooper, Deathtrooper, Stormtrooper, and K-2SO out in Japan late this year and in early 2017. Aside from these, which you'll have to import if you want them as soon as possible, all of other toys above will be available from September 30t onwards, with select items being made available for pre-order from tomorrow (if you want to avoid last year's mania).

I don't want to say that. It feels like hyperbole, and over the next few days I have no doubt that a lot of other televisions are going to use similar tech for similar results, but look at that image above. Note how that 65-inch display is actually thinner than that woman's finger. Now come back and tell me that isn't incredible. What's The Worst Show You Have Seen Every Episode Of?

"Consumer engagement is the core focus for the event, and our speakers this year are focused on the specifics of how to achieve this engagement," said Harry Wang, Senior Director, Research, Parks Associates. "Throughout the event, healthcare executives discussed strategies to achieve consumer engagement, such as how to define and track engagement, what is the role of the pharmacist, how can connected devices impact chronic conditions, what is the best environment to approach consumers about health and wellness solutions, and what is the impact of apps on consumer behavior." Parks Associates research shows the adoption of connected healthcare devices has increased 40% since 2Q 2014 but only 13-14% of U.S. broadband households show interest in new health management services. "The industry needs to focus on metrics such as Net Promoter Scores (NPS) for healthcare solutions, which are key measurements of consumer satisfaction with a solution," Wang said. "As part of the ongoing shift to a consumer-focused market, it is essential for companies to be attentive to consumer needs and maintain strong consumer connections. They can take lessons from outside the industry, from successes such as Pokémon Go, in designing healthcare apps and solutions." Connected Health Summit focused on continued market challenges and opportunities. Parks Associates research indicates the number of people 65-85 will account for more than 16% of the total population by 2025 and chronic disease currently accounts for more than 70% of total healthcare costs. Of the more than 60% of consumers in U.S. broadband households with a chronic condition, 11% do not have a primary care doctor. "Only 36% of U.S. consumers living in broadband households know that their employer offers a sponsored wellness program, and among them, more than half choose not to use it," Wang said. "Making these solutions seamless and easy is critical to usage." Conference sponsors include Independa, higi, ARM, Care Innovations, Healthways, Alarm.com, Honeywell, MEDL Mobile, MultiTech, New Fields Technologies, PokitDok, Z-Wave, ZigBee, the California Health Care Foundation, Bright.md, Medable, and Home8.

About Connected Health Summit Connected Health Summit: Engaging Consumers analyzes the role of innovative connected health solutions in driving changes in consumer behaviors as well as healthcare systems, insurers, and hospital networks. The event focuses on four areas of consumer health, which require active consumer participation to be successful: remote health monitoring for accountable care, consumer-centric wellness and fitness solutions, independent living technologies and services, and innovative convenience care models.

Photo courtesy of Pexels SpaceX rocket disaster. It was a giant uh-oh moment for Elon Musk’s SpaceX venture on Thursday when its rocket exploded in Florida, marking the company’s second spacecraft loss in less than a year. Bloomberg reported the accident happened at Cape Canaveral Air Force Base Launch Complex 40 as SpaceX was getting ready for Saturday’s launch of Amos-6, an Israeli communications satellite. The satellite was a Facebook project to bring better internet access to Africa, the Middle East and Europe. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said he was “deeply disappointed” by the explosion.  Wal-Mart plans to slash 7,000 jobs. Wal-Mart Stories Inc., the nation’s largest private employer, plans to chop thousands of accounting and invoicing positions across the country as the retailer focuses on competing with online-only competitors such as Amazon. The Wall Street Journal reported long-term employees’ jobs are likely to be cut, among the highest-paid hourly workers in stores. Instead, Wal-Mart plans to automate or centralize many tasks previously performed by back-office employees, transitioning those employees to customer-facing jobs. It’s a gamble the retailer is willing to take to boost online sales and make its stores more appealing places to shop.  Allegiant Air safety record draws scrutiny. The Washington Post took a closer look at the safety and maintenance practices of budget airline Allegiant Air following dozens of incidents that have drawn widespread alarm. While Allegiant’s earnings are impressive, the same cannot be said about it’s safety record. About a year ago, an Allegiant plane caught fire shortly after take-off, the pilot quickly turned the plane around and helped evacuate passengers, including carrying a paraplegic passenger off the plane himself. The company fired the pilot for his actions. The Washington Post reports the incident was just one of many in the past year. Who is really behind a Chinese firm on a global buying spree? On paper, villagers in a small Chinese farming town control multibillion-dollar stakes in the Anbang Insurance Group, which owns the Waldorf Astoria in New York, along with many other global names and properties. The New York Times reported U.S. regulators now are looking into whether the small-town investors are holding their shares on behalf of others. The powerful firm caught many in the investment world by surprise when it burst onto the scene with offers to pay more than $30 billion for numerous assets around the world.    Related Posts Must Read Money Stories For Tuesday, Aug. 30 Must Read Money Stories for Wednesday, Aug. 31 Must Read Money Stories for Thursday, Sept. 1 Search Our Site Search for: Subscribe to Our Podcast     Latest News Must-Read Money Stories for Friday, Jan. 6 Share this!Feds reach settlement in epic MF Global case Federal regulators January 6, 2017 How to Ask for an Interview via Email: 5 Key Steps Share this!  Most of us spend 28 percent of our workday on January 6, 2017 Donald W.

E-Mail Share via e-mail To Add a message Your e-mail Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Comments Print The Boston Globe Tweet Share Jessica Teich for The Boston Globe The author’s parents outside their motor home. By Jessica Teich Globe correspondent  September 02, 2016 For my parents, home is where they park it. Last summer, they sold the 3,500 square-foot house that both my mother and I grew up in. With downsizing and exploration in mind, they cruised right past their Baby Boomer peers and moved into a decked out Class A motor home — with two cats and a Lab mutt in tow. What started as an unconventional way to house hunt has morphed into their new way of life. It’s been a bumpy ride at times, but they are adapting to a mobile lifestyle. Now, a year into their adventure, I ask them to explain what happens after you make the decision to pare down, pack up, and hit the road. Mom, Dad – Sue, Dave – Hi. What spurred you to move into an RV instead of another house? Advertisement S In the very beginning, we wanted to use the RV as a means to look around the country and find a place to settle down. But we quickly realized we wanted this to be more than just a temporary way of life. OK, let’s talk logistics. You don’t own land right now. Where do you stay every night? D If our tanks are almost full, we’ll find a campground or park and stay overnight. We use their electric, sewer, and water so that we can run the laundry and dishwasher. Then we’re good to empty our holding tanks, refill with fresh water, and boondock [live completely self-contained] for the next four to six days before we have to do it all again. And when you’re boondocking, is it easy to find a place to set up camp? Get The Weekender in your inbox: The Globe's top picks for what to see and do each weekend, in Boston and beyond. Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here S It truthfully takes a lot of planning and forethought to boondock. I use an app that shows the businesses that not just allow, but encourage overnight RV parking — places like Cracker Barrel, Walmart, and Cabela’s. We make sure that it’s a well-lit lot in a safe area. We always feel safe, since we’re lucky enough to have an extremely protective dog. What do you do about mail? D It goes to a company that specializes in forwarding mail to fulltime RVers. I check my deliveries online and have the option to have them scanned, mailed to me, or shredded. It’s about $250 a year. How do you pick an RV? S It depends who you ask. There are people who wouldn’t want our type of setup because it’s too much bling. It’s too far away from “camping.” Some people want that rustic, outdoorsy, pioneer experience. We don’t. I hope to try hiking and the activities that are more synonymous with camping, but I doubt I will – and that’s OK! There’s a place for people like me, too, in this culture. It’s so diversified; there are pop-up tents, 45-foot tag axles with two bathrooms, and everything in between. Jessica Teich for the Boston Globe Is it more cost-efficient than running a brick-and-mortar household? Advertisement D No. Upkeep of a diesel coach is expensive. On top of the scheduled maintenance for the motor home, there’s fuel, service contracts, insurance, maintenance, campground fees . . . There’s a lot more than just the mortgage. S We thought we would get a used RV at a low rate, which would be cheaper than maintaining the house, but the confines of that original idea expanded. Instead, we invested in a unit that we are very comfortable living in. What we don’t pay for, of course, is the pool maintenance, landscaping, snow removal, and property taxes. So is this a feasible move for anyone? Can anyone pack up and move into an RV? D Yes, but you have to research it very carefully. It’s not just purchasing your type of vehicle; it’s everything that goes along with it. The industry as a whole has a lack of quality control, and salesmen can be exceptionally tricky. We went through a lot of strife to get to where we are now. S And it’s not work-free living once you’re in. A lot of effort goes into keeping things clean and running smoothly on a daily basis. It’s all relative as far as cost, though. I mean, we went from a 3,500 square-foot house on an acre of land with an in-ground pool, to a 38-foot motor home on a freightliner. Jessica Teich for the Boston Globe What did you do with 3,500-square-feet worth of belongings? D We gave most of it away to family, friends, our buyers, the local food kitchen, and a homeless shelter. Everything else of meaning is in a jam-packed 10-by-15-foot storage unit. What is your favorite thing about being full-time RVers? S I’m truly leaving less of a footprint behind me in an RV. There’s only finite amount of space on this earth and I’m surely not taking up more than my share. I’m much more cognizant of water and energy usage. This lifestyle also forces you to take a hard look at what you can tangibly do without. It’s the ultimate tiny house living. Oh, plus, I don’t ever have to pack for a vacation again — I just bring my house. D Whenever or wherever I stop, I push a button and I’m home. What about your least favorite part? D It’s basically living in a home that’s in constant earthquake mode, which means constant repairs. In the last year, hundreds of items have broken just from normal wear and tear. S I don’t feel as compelled to cook as I did, despite having a full kitchen. I miss my big kitchen and making huge holiday dinners. But we’ve created new traditions and found ways to entertain better than ever before. Jessica Teich for the Boston Globe Do you have advice for prospective buyers? D Don’t buy a brand new unit, or you’ll suffer the anguish of insane repairs since there is virtually no quality control in RV production. The standard for manufacturers is to make sure the unit looks visually great, not caring about what’s underneath. Buy an RV that’s a year or two old with low mileage that’s been stored properly. It’ll save you a lot of time, stress, and money. S Well then, don’t you need to be able to detect things like water damage, leaks, and rust? You kind of need to know what you’re doing. I don’t — that’s why I have you. She has a point, Dad: You’re incredibly business savvy with a background in buying and selling used cars. How much know-how do you really need to successfully run an RV? D Knowing just the basics is fine. You don’t need to know a ton going in, because [RVing] is a constant learning experience. I learn something new every day. This is such a vocal community, and there are always, always people who are willing to help you. S That’s true. This culture includes the kindest, most supportive and helpful people I have ever met. From every walk of life. People are so eager to share their experiences and knowledge with you. Will you consider moving back into a stationary house? If so, where will home be next? D When I’m finished traveling every inch of this country, yes. Somewhere warmer. S Oh my good God, David. We’ll find home when we get there. Jessica Teich can be reached at jessicarteich@gmail.com. Loading comments...

That said, the data wasn't altogether weak, with payroll additions at a healthy 155,000 clip. And taking into consideration the 20,000 upward revision to July data, one can term the August data as fairly in line. However, the jobless held steady, in contrast to expectations for a downtick. The dollar has pulled back in the wake of the data and commodities are higher. Meanwhile, the trade deficit for July narrowed, which is a positive for third quarter GDP data. Corporate news flow is mixed. The markets could now seek additional clarity from a Fed speech scheduled for the day.   U.S. stocks went about in a listless manner on Thursday amid the release of mixed economic data before ending the trading day mixed.    The major averages opened higher but gave back their gains in early trading. After retreating below the unchanged line and languishing in the red until the mid-session, the averages trimmed their losses and took divergent routes.    The Dow Industrials spent most of the remainder of the session above the unchanged line before ending up 18.42 points or 0.10 percent at 18,419, and the Nasdaq Composite closed 13.99 points or 0.27 percent higher at 5,227. However, the S&P 500 Index traded mostly below the unchanged line and ended 0.09 points lower at 2,171,    Sixteen of the thirty Dow components closed lower, while the remaining fourteen stocks receded. Wal-Mart (WMT), Nike (NKE) and Procter & Gamble (PG) were among the biggest gainers of the session but American Express (AXP) moved notably to the downside.    Among the sectors, gold stocks rallied strongly, while oil service stocks came under selling pressure.    On the economic front, the Labor Department reported that jobless claims rose to 263,000 in the week ended August 27th from an unrevised reading of 261,000 for the previous week. Economists expected an increase to 265,000. The four-week moving average fell to 263,000 from 264,000. Meanwhile, continuing claims rose by 14,000 to 2.159 million in the week ended August 20th.     The Institute for Supply Management's survey showed that manufacturing activity unexpectedly contracted in August. The manufacturing PMI slid to 49.4 in August from 52.6 in July. Economists expected a reading of 52.2 for the month. The new orders index fell about 8 points to 49.1 and the order backlogs index sunk further into contraction territory by virtue of a 2.5 point-decline to 45.5. The employment index was at 48.3, signaling contraction for the eighth time in nine months.     Markit's U.S. manufacturing PMI released ahead of the ISM's survey showed a reading of 52 for August, down from 52.9 in July.    The Commerce Department reported that construction spending was unchanged in July compared to the previous month. Economists expected 0.6 percent growth for the month. In June, spending climbed by an upwardly revised 0.9 percent. Annually, construction spending was up 1.7 percent. Spending on private construction rose 1 percent month-over-month, with residential and non-residential construction increasing 0.3 percent and 1.7 percent, respectively. However, public construction spending fell 3.1 percent.    The revised productivity and costs report released by the Labor Department showed that non-farm productivity fell 0.6 percent sequentially in the second quarter, in line with estimates. It was earlier estimated to have declined 0.5 percent. Output rose, but the rate of growth was superseded by the increase in hours worked. Compensation was upwardly revised, which led to unit labor costs growth to be revised to 4.3 percent from the initially reported 2 percent gain.     Currency, Commodity Markets   Crude oil futures for October delivery are rising $0.68 to $43.84 a barrel after slumping $1.54 to $43.16 a barrel on Thursday. Gold futures are currently trading at $1,331.30 an ounce, up $14.20 from the previous session's close of $1,317.10 an ounce. On Thursday, gold rose $5.70.   On the currency front, the U.S. dollar is trading at 103.22 yen compared to the 103.23 yen it fetched at the close of New York trading on Thursday. Against the euro, the dollar is valued at $1.1227 compared to yesterday's $1.1197.  Asia   The Asian markets closed mixed yet again, tracking the uneventful performance by Wall Street stocks overnight. The overall mood was one of caution, as traders awaited the U.S. non-farm payrolls report.     The Japanese market ended little change with a negative bias after languishing below the unchanged line for the bulk of the session. The Nikkei 225 Index ended down 1.16 points or 0.01 percent at 16,926, pulling back from a 3-month high.     Most export, oil, chemical and textile stocks moved to the downside. However, food, construction, retail, financial, utility, telecom and pharma stocks gained ground.    Australia's All Ordinaries Index traded below the unchanged line throughout the session before ending down 40.60 points or 0.74 percent at 5,471, its lowest level since July 13th. Most sectors declined, with telecom, industrial, healthcare, financial and real estate stocks leading the slide. On the other hand, material and energy stocks rose modestly.    However, China's Shanghai Composite Index closed at 3,067, up 4.05 points or 0.13 percent, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index added 104.36 points or 0.45 percent before ending at 3,067.    On the economic front, the results of a survey by Japan's Cabinet Office showed that confidence among Japanese consumers rose more than expected in August. The consumer confidence index rose to 42 from 41.3 in July, while economists expected a more modest improvement to 41.8. All three sub-indexes also showed improvement.    Data released by the Bank of Japan showed that the monetary base jumped 24.2 percent year-over-year in August, slower than the 24.7 percent increase in July and the slowest growth in over a year.     Europe   European stocks opened notably higher and are seen sustaining the gains amid some volatility, as oil prices are firmer. With the release of the U.S. non-farm payrolls data, the indexes have legged up further.   On the economic front, Eurostat reported that producer prices in the eurozone fell 2.8 percent year-over-year in July following a 3.1 percent decline in June. Economists expected a 2.9 percent drop for the month. On a monthly basis, producer prices were up 0.1 percent, in line with estimates.    The U.K. construction sector registered a sustained contraction in business activity but the pace of decline was only marginal, the results of a survey by Markit showed. The Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply/Markit Purchasing Managers' Index rose more-than-expected to 49.2 in August from July's 85-month low of 45.9.     U.S. Economic Reports   Employment in the U.S. increased by less than anticipated in the month of August, according to a report released by the Labor Department. The Labor Department said non-farm payroll employment climbed by 151,000 jobs in August after surging up by an upwardly revised 275,000 jobs in July. Economists had expected an increase of about 175,000 jobs compared to the jump of 255,000 jobs originally reported for the previous month. The report also said the unemployment rate held at 4.9 percent in August, unchanged from the previous month. The unemployment rate had been expected to edge down to 4.8 percent. The U.S. trade deficit narrowed by much more than expected in the month of July, the Commerce Department revealed in a report, with the smaller deficit reflecting an increase in the value of exports and a decrease in the value of imports. The Commerce Department said the trade deficit narrowed to $39.5 billion in July from a revised $44.7 billion in June. Economists had expected the deficit to narrow to $41.3 billion from the $44.5 billion originally reported for the previous month.   The Commerce Department will also release its factory orders data for July at 10 am ET. Economists expect factory orders to have increased by 2 percent month-over-month.    In June, factory orders fell by 1.5 percent. Meanwhile, durable goods orders, accounting for the bulk of factory orders, jumped 4.4 percent month-over-month in July following a revised 4.2 percent drop in June. Annually, durable goods orders fell 3.3 percent. Excluding transportation, orders rose a better than expected 1.5 percent month-over-month. Core capital goods orders were up 1.6 percent. However, shipments of this category of goods, which are directly plugged into GDP calculations, were down 0.4 percent.   Richmond Federal Reserve Bank President Jeffrey Lacker is due to give a speech on interest rate benchmarks to the Virginia Association of Economists in Richmond at 1 pm ET.    Stocks in Focus Cooper Companies (COO) announced better than expected second quarter results, while the company's third quarter and full year earnings per share guidance was in line. The company also announced that its CFO Gregory Matz is set to retire by early 2017 and will be replaced by Albert White, effective November 1st.     lululemon athletica (LULU) reported in line second quarter adjusted earnings per share, but its full year adjusted earnings per share guidance was lukewarm.     Smith & Wesson (SWHC) reported better than expected first quarter results and issued upbeat guidance for the second quarter and the full year.    VeriFone (PAY) reported above-consensus third quarter adjusted earnings per share, but its revenues trailed estimates. The company's fourth quarter guidance was downbeat, and it lowered its full year guidance.    Gap (GPS) reported a 2 percent drop in net sales for the four weeks ended August 27th, with comparable store sales for August down 3 percent compared to a 2 percent drop last year.     Hewlett-Packard Enterprises (HPE) said it has completed its pending sale of its equity interest in Mphasis, an Indian IT-services company, to private equity funds managed by Blackstone (BX).     Verizon (VZ) announced that its CFO Francis Shammo plans to retire at the end of 2016 after a 27-year stint with the company.

Retrograde views on LGBT rights and a bold stand against pornography became punch lines for late-night talk show hosts. But for a few minutes on July 12, GOP convention delegates assembled in Cleveland battled over an issue that their party hadn’t worried about for decades: corporate power. Hawaii delegate Adrienne King told the crowd of mild-mannered professionals at Huntington Convention Center that big companies were abusing their market dominance to freeze out smaller competitors and limit consumer choice. Breaking them up, she argued, would protect the free market from manipulation. The party’s official statement of principles needed to express support for action against underhanded bigwigs that rig prices and intimidate small firms. Republicans, after all, used to go after these guys all the time. “I’d like to remind my fellow delegates that the original trust-buster was Republican President Theodore Roosevelt,” King said. This caused a bit of a stir. For decades, Republican leaders in Washington had preached to the party faithful that government was their primary economic enemy. King was complicating the doctrine. “Many things that Teddy Roosevelt supported are not things that we stand for as a party,” retorted one delegate bitterly. “He was actually a progressive president, not a conservative free-enterprise one.” Another insisted that Roosevelt had only broken up “government” monopolies, while someone else supported King, accusing big airlines and hotels of colluding to raise prices. Still another suggested their effort would trick Republicans into endorsing nefarious new government regulations. King’s proposal was eventually voted down. But not before she revealed that many of her Republican peers ― including well-to-do attendees of political conventions ― believe the free market has as much to fear from Big Business as it does from Big Government. The fact that this debate took place at all shows an important and generally overlooked shift in GOP thinking that has been underway for months. In a March hearing, three Republican senators questioned whether Federal Trade Commission Chair Edith Ramirez was being tough enough on everything from Google’s control over search engine results to corporate consolidation in the market for agricultural seeds. House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling (R-Texas) issued a report this summer upbraiding the Department of Justice for treating high-level bankers who broke the law as “too big to jail.” Just this month, three Republicans, including Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), cried foul over Verisign’s monopolization of the market for .com internet domain names. None of these actions would have been conceivable 10, five or even two years ago. Businesses, according to the old conservative orthodoxy, were good. And the bigger, the better. Targeting a big company was tantamount to punishing success. How, after all, could a company get to be big if it weren’t very good at what it did? EpiPen Price Rage And Lousy Cable Service  But the GOP is slowly rediscovering antitrust policy ― one of the most powerful economic weapons the federal government can deploy against corporate abuse. Antitrust laws give government the power to block mergers between big companies, break up companies that are too big to fail, or force megafirms to offer lower prices when they don’t face serious competition. A century ago, antitrust was the most fiercely debated issue in American public life, championed by both Teddy Roosevelt and his Democratic rival, Woodrow Wilson. But antitrust enforcement began a long period of atrophy under Ronald Reagan that lasted into the Barack Obama years. A year ago, the field remained a Washington backwater, where government lawyers would float along before hoisting themselves to a more lucrative safe harbor in the private sector. That seems to be changing. Antitrust isn’t careening around cable news yet, but in the nation’s capital, the migration of the policy wonk herd has been unmistakeable. It’s not just a Republican thing. In April, Obama issued an executive order calling for federal agencies to combat anti-competitive behavior. This summer, two liberal think tanks published reports taking aim at corporate monopoly powers. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) gave a no-holds-barred speech in June calling out not only big banks, but Google, Apple, Amazon and Walmart by name. In July, antitrust language landed in the Democratic Party’s 2016 platform for the first time since 1988. And the public is paying attention. When pharmaceutical giant Mylan hiked the price on its lifesaving EpiPen simply because there was no other game in town, it generated fury from just about everyone who didn’t own stock in the company. There’s a solid economic rationale behind Washington’s new big thing. Monopolies and oligopolies are distorting the markets for everything from pet food to cable service. There’s a reason why cable companies have such persistently lousy customer-service ratings. They know you have few (if any) alternatives. Today, two-thirds of the 900 industries tracked by The Economist feature heavier concentration at the top than they did in 1997. The global economy is in the middle of a merger wave big enough to make 2015 the biggest year in history for corporate consolidation. But Washington often looks the other way when the economy impales itself (see: mortgages, subprime). Somebody has to make the gore impossible to ignore. An Earthquake, A Revelation Most political junkies have never heard of the man chiefly responsible for the current Beltway antitrust revival: Barry C. Lynn. A former business journalist, Lynn has spent more than a decade carving out his own fiefdom at a calm, centrist Washington think tank called the New America Foundation. In the process, he has changed the way D.C. elites think about corporate power. “Barry is the hub,” says Zephyr Teachout, a fiery progressive who recently clinched the Democratic nomination for a competitive House seat in New York. “He is at the center of a growing new ― I hesitate to call it a movement ― but a group of people who recognize that we have a problem with monopolies not only in our economy, but in our democracy.” Many Southerners who relocate to the nation’s capital try to temper their accents for the elite crowd that dominates the District’s social scene. Lynn, a South Florida native, never shed his drawl. He pronounces “sonofabitch” as a single word, which he uses to describe both corrupt politicians and big corporations. He is a blunt man in a town that rewards caginess and flexibility. But like King, Lynn’s critique of monopolies does not reflect a disdain for business itself. After spending the first leg of his career in Latin America as a reporter for The Associated Press and Agence France Presse, Lynn landed a job in D.C. as executive editor of Global Business ― a magazine that catered to C-suite corporate society. It was a great gig for a 33-year-old. In 1994, the North American Free Trade Agreement and the World Trade Organization treaties had unleashed a brave new corporate world, and companies were hungry for information about how to exploit the international legal terrain. Lynn enjoyed the work. In the early years, his interest in globalization was tactical ― how would firms solve these new puzzles created by international law? His sanguine outlook was shaken by a 7.3-magnitude earthquake that devastated Jiji, Taiwan, on Sept. 21, 1999. The disaster claimed 2,505 lives. Its aftermath served as an economic revelation for Lynn. “All these factories in the United States shut down,” Lynn says. “And they shut down because the earthquake messed up the airport for the city where all of their semiconductors were made.” A Warning Ahead Of Its Time Globalization had allowed firms to travel anywhere for labor, resources or tax savings. But these new capabilities didn’t just help companies cut costs. Instead, Lynn observed, critical manufacturing activities were now heavily concentrated in specific, often unstable, locales. An earthquake in Taiwan could mean sudden layoffs for Dell and Hewlett-Packard employees in the United States whose jobs depended on semiconductor shipments from a single city half a world away. This wasn’t simply a problem of globalization. It was globalization combined with excessive concentration. If there had been many different factories producing these semiconductors all over the world, the earthquake, of course, would have remained a human tragedy. But it would not have forced layoffs on the other side of the globe. Lynn left Global Business for The New America Foundation in 2001 and began work on his first book, End of the Line: The Rise and Coming Fall of the Global Corporation, which argues that globalization and merger mania had injected a new fragility into international politics. Disruptive events ― earthquakes, coups, famines, or at worst, war ― could now wreak havoc on U.S. products that had once been safely manufactured domestically. Production of anything from light bulbs to computers all could shut down without warning. It was a frightening vision with implications for economic policy and national security alike. It was also ideologically inconvenient for the techno-utopian zeitgeist of its day. Lynn’s book landed on shelves about the same time as Thomas Friedman’s better-known tome, The World Is Flat, which declared globalization a triumph of innovation and hard work for anyone willing to do the hard work of innovating. Today, Lynn’s predictions of market disruption and political unrest appear to have been ahead of their time. Early globalization champions, including Martin Wolf and Lawrence Summers, are rethinking their judgments of a decade ago. But Lynn turned several influential heads when his book was published. Thomas Frank, bestselling author of What’s The Matter With Kansas?, became a Lynn enthusiast. So did food writer Michael Pollan. “He was writing about an issue that nobody was paying attention to, and he was doing it with a very strong sense of history,” Pollan says. “Barry understood antitrust going back to the trust-busters a century ago, and how our understanding of the issue shrank during the Reagan administration … The food movement is not very sophisticated on those issues.” The Big Problem With Big Business Lynn’s history nerd-dom is eccentric in a town that hyperventilates over every hour of the cable news cycle. Ask about Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton, and Lynn will oblige you a polite sentence or two. Ask him about former Supreme Court Justices Louis Brandeis or William Howard Taft, and you’ll need to reschedule your dinner plans. “He once asked me to read about Roman law for a piece on common carriage,” says Lina Khan, referencing a plank of net neutrality policy not typically associated with the Code of Justinian. After he published his second book in 2010, Lynn began bringing on his own staff within New America. Khan was one of his first hires. Teachout, a Fordham University Law School professor, was another. Teachout eventually ran for office and published a book of her own on the history of corruption in America. Another of Lynn’s associates, Christopher Leonard, published a book on meat industry monopolies around the same time. These works shared a common theme: Monopolistic businesses create social problems beyond consumer price-gouging, from buying off politicians to degrading the quality of our food. Analyzing the political power of companies with overwhelming market positions used to be a normal part of antitrust thinking. But over the decades, a narrower conception focused on consumer prices has taken hold in Washington. Even if anti-competitive behavior can be proved, according to this thinking, it’s not a problem unless it raises prices for consumers. Under this view, it’s not necessarily an antitrust problem, if, say, Amazon used its market position to force publishers into charging lower prices for books. If the result is lower prices, everything is fine. It would only become a problem if Amazon used its market power to raise prices. That’s not how Lynn sees it. When the Authors Guild, the American Booksellers Association, the Association of Authors’ Representatives and Authors United went after Amazon in 2015 for requiring publishers to accept lower e-book prices, Lynn penned a 24-page position paper to the Department of Justice on their behalf. It wasn’t just a question of immediate consumer impact. Amazon’s market position was so dominant, he argued, that the company could restrict or cut off access to books from publishers it wanted to punish for rejecting its pricing requirements. It could “exercise control over the marketplace of ideas in ways that threaten not merely open markets but free speech.” Monopolies, according to Lynn, are fundamentally political enterprises -- not just players in a market. The episode was part of the furor surrounding Amazon’s high-profile entente with book publisher Hachette, in which the online retailer made no bones about its position. “We want lower e-book prices,” Amazon wrote in a public letter. “Hachette does not.” Amazon eventually settled with Hachette under a deal that both parties declared acceptable. But before Lynn became interested in the antitrust problems surrounding publishing, Khan had been looking into broader problems for small businesses. In 2012, Khan discovered that new business formation in the United States had been declining for decades. Her finding ran counter to conventional wisdom, which had held that ― aside from a few hiccups like the financial crisis ― bustling Silicon Valley startups were feeding a small business renaissance. As the Amazon conflict demonstrates, some of Lynn’s chief targets are tech giants. That makes him an odd fit for New America, which was founded in 1999 as Silicon Valley’s think tank in search of a “radical center,” as The New York Times put it. Google Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt is still on New America’s board of directors, yet Lynn consistently puts the company under the microscope. When Warren blasted tech monopolies this summer, she was speaking at a conference that Lynn had organized. When Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) asked about “platform” monopolies at a Senate hearing in March, he was echoing Lynn’s objections to digital kingpins, including Amazon, Apple and Google. But Lynn’s apostasy gets results. The Obama administration conferred with him on an anti-monopoly executive order this spring, and he helped work antitrust language into the 2016 Democratic Party platform. He can’t claim the same kind of direct credit for the Republican Party’s partial conversion to the antitrust cause. But his work is changing the way Washington thinks about corporate power, and that shift is having bipartisan repercussions. None of this means that the next president will be signing radical new antitrust laws into place. But that’s exactly why Lynn’s work matters. As King noted at the GOP convention, powerful antitrust laws are already on the books. The Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission have broad leeway to take action against big companies. They just rarely pursue it to the full extent of their authority. If the next president listens to Lynn, the FTC chair could become one of the most powerful positions in American government.

Pilgrims today are following a very ancient path By the A.M. Costa Rica staff The pilgrimage symbolizes the difficult path of life upwards to a Christian heaven or, perhaps, a Buddhist nirvana. Those Costa Ricans who were on the trail Sunday or who will be on the trail today are involved in an activity that may well be at least 22,000 years old. Such journeys, mostly by foot, are a phenomenon found in almost all societies, past and present, according to one expert. Pilgrimages can be religious, political or secular, as in the case of  travels to Disneyland. Those that get the most attention are religious, and these date back before history. The megalithic site Göbekli Tepe in Turkey might well have been the destination of pilgrims as much as 13,000 years ago. The later Stonehenge most certainly was. Perhaps even older than Göbekli Tepe are some pilgrimage sites in India. Anthropologist Martin Gray said “In India we find the oldest continually operating pilgrimage tradition in the entire world. The practice of pilgrimage in India is so deeply embedded in the cultural psyche and the number of pilgrimage sites is so large that the entire subcontinent may actually be regarded as one grand and continuous sacred space.” He wrote an authoritative book on sacred sites worldwide. The ancient Greeks had many pilgrimage sites and for various reasons. Says pilgrimage expert Matthew Dillon: "The pious need for initiations, cures and oracles drew Greeks to panhellenic sanctuaries where they invoked the gods to meet their particular needs. The wide range of questions asked at oracles, the cures sought at healing sanctuaries, and the need for reassurance about the life after death, indicate the very great degree to which the Greeks viewed the gods as intervening in the lives of individuals and in the affairs of the state. " The Canadian Museum of History points out that among the ancient Greeks, a pilgrimage to Olympia to see the athletic events and to participate in the sacrifices to Zeus and other festivities was something of great importance and many people attended several times. Because it was a pagan festival it conflicted with the growth and spread of Christianity and Roman emperors, who were Christian, banned the Olympics around 400 AD. Less well documented is the economic impact of pilgrimages. One NBC news report quoting Manchester University scholar Ian Reader said that religious travel generates at least $8 billion a year for shrine-centered economies and provides employment for thousands. There probably was an economic factor when Muhammad ordered that every Muslim visit at least once the prophet’s hometown. Some sources say that the Mecca pilgrimage is thousands of years older than the Seventh century founder of Islam. A curious fact is that pilgrimage and economics figured in one of the major advances of the Western world. Johannes Gutenberg formed an investment group to produce religious relics for pilgrims to Aachen, Germany, but the event featuring homage to the Emperor Charlemagne was postponed by a flood.  Gutenberg, instead, created moveable type and the printing press to satisfy his investors in 1439. The best-known pilgrimage in the English-speaking world is that to Canterbury and the  tomb of the 11th century archbishop there Thomas Becket. Geoffrey Chaucer wrote the lengthy collection of stories that were attributed to pilgrims and now called the  “Canterbury Tales.” The 14th century Middle English text has caused anguish for modern students. In the Spanish-speaking world the Camino de Santiago probably is the best recognized. The pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela in Galicia, Spain, and the presumed resting place of St. James, the apostle, was one of the major destinations in the Middle Ages along with Rome and Jerusalem. In Latin America, European priests tried to use the native religions to promote Christianity. Churches frequently were built on sites that had been sacred before the arrival of Colombus. Then there were the reports of visits by the Virgin Mary that left some tangible evidence. Every country in the Americas has at least one such site. That includes the Basilica de Nuestra Señora de los Ángeles in Cartago where thousands of pilgrims or romeros are headed today. The tangible evidence there is a small stone carving of the Virgin Mary holding the infant Jesus in her arms. It is said to be of divine origin or at least of divine intervention.

Click Here: www.colinasdelsolcr.com 8951-8/29/16 Our readers’ opinions The political process is a circus Dear A.M. Costa Rica: Although I was born on the mainland in the U.S., after discharge from the military I lived in Alaska for 30-plus years until retirement.  Alaska is approximately 2,200 miles (3,500 kilometers) from the nearest U.S. point, Washington State.  In addition, Alaska has 51 native tribes, many who have closer ties to relatives in Russia than to anyone in the United States. The European Union has 28 countries in their membership and covers 1,670,000 miles (4,325,280 kilometers).  The United States has 50 states and covers 3,800,000 miles (9,841,954 kilometers).  In addition to the separation of Alaska from the mainland U.S., Hawaii is approximately 2,500 miles (4,023 kilometers) from the mainland.  In the last 200 years Europe and its neighbors have witnessed countless armed internal conflicts, while the United States only one. Democracy is always in state of compromise.  There has never been a society, religion, country, etc. who was one hundred percent united in thought.  If, in the future, there will be a group of multiple races who think identical, then I would not wish to live there. I am 76 now, when I read one of your readers stating that the candidate should be from heartland America I am confused.  With our complexity, the heartland has hundreds of definitions.  Many of the heartland areas are doing all that is possible to disenfranchise voters who do not meet their ideal. I believe there was a time (during mine and older generations of leadership) that America thought about people, about helping, about welcoming with open arms, about respecting other points of views. GONE.  I believe it unlikely these values will fully  return. Almost everyone plays to the media now, and the pro and con commentators of a very big industry.  There are news media that admit lying and misleading in court without penalty. The U.S. has now privatized most prison functions, therefore big money, therefore more persons in prison. The U.S. now has one of the best military units in the world, fully voluntary and highly trained.  When you have thousands of employees who are highly trained, you must use that expertise or lose it.  Therefore more combat action than really necessary.  The U.S. defense budget is more than all allies combined.  What other industry can you say the U.S. has that would come close to that? The U.S. has a health insurance industry that employees hundreds of thousands and makes millions in profit, yet there are persons who do not have health coverage or go bankrupt because their costs were not covered.  Then you have fellow Americans doing everything possible to deny coverage to those who cannot be otherwise covered. In such a complex and diverse society, it is a wonder if you can have a candidate who garners close to 50 percent of the vote.  Even then, there is always a vast percentage that will oppose anything you try to achieve. What provides discredit to the national political structure is the campaigning. Sanders was most vehement against Clinton, now endorses her.  During the 2008 process Sarah Palin was the vice president candidate for the Republican Party.  Being from Alaska, I thought how stupid that was when so many other possibilities were available.  Now there is Trump, when there are so many other possibilities. Yet, the U.S. continues to allow big money, lobbyist and playing to the media and their consultants to dominate.  Until this changes, the political process will remain a circus. This current election has a choice that is probably more different than any other in the U.S. history, a choice that affects the entire world.  I hope the voters choose wisely. Bob Piazza Birri, Santa Barbra de Heredia Here are 17 reasons not to vote for Trump Dear A.M. Costa Rica:   My observations about Donald Trump, his campaign, and his characteristics are as follows: 1. He claims to be a great businessman, but he inherited a real estate empire from his father and got an additional $2 million from his father to make his own investments. Plus he lucked out by coming into real estate development during a period when the U.S. economy was booming. 2. He seems to be proud about how his bankruptcies have left the contractors with unpaid bills and the workers with unpaid wages. 3. He refuses to release his current income tax form, most likely because he knows the information will be embarrassing and will expose his rip-offs of the taxpayer. He first said that he could not release it while being audited, but now he is no longer being audited. 4. He criticizes U.S. companies that manufacture products overseas, but at least five of the products that he markets are manufactured in foreign countries, including México and China. 5. He raves about bringing jobs to U.S. citizens and immigrants taking away jobs, but he brought Polish workers into the country to build one of his hotels and currently employs workers who are not U.S. Citizens. 6. Another person wrote the entire book “The Art of the Deal” that Trump claims to have written, and that person states that writing the book was a major mistake, does not endorse Trump, and refers to Trump as a sociopath. 7. He claims to be patriotic, but he got two student deferments while in college and one medical deferment after college in order to stay out of the Vietnam war. 8. His campaign has been based on instilling fear and on character assassination with no detailed policy statements, and it is uncertain whether or not he would follow stated GOP policy statements or represent conservative Republican values. 9. He has no detailed plans for carrying-out any of the activities that he proposes, and has no idea of how such activities will be worked into the U.S. budget. 10. There is no way to understand his opinion on anything because he continually contradicts his own statements. 11. He is totally uninformed and uneducated with respect to foreign affairs. When questioned, he did not know who the Kurds are and did not know the difference between Sunni and Shia Muslims. In the speech that he claimed addressed foreign affairs, he contradicted himself seven times. 12. He espouses the U.S. Constitution, but many of his stated intentions go against the Constitution. It is likely that he has never read the Constitution in its entirety, and it is likely that he cannot quote the Second Amendment or any other amendment that he advocates. 13. He has an extremely narcissistic mental condition that is likely to affect all of his decisions and could be disastrous to the U.S. foreign relations. 14. He claims to be religious, but is not an active member of any religion and cannot state a verse from the Bible correctly even though he said that the Bible is his favorite book. 15. He likes to draw attention to his current wife, but has nothing to say about his two former wives. 16.  He claims to be educated when referring to his college degree specializing in real estate. 17.  He often has difficulty completing a sentence that is grammatically correct, has a very limited vocabulary and is so unfocused that he often drifts to a completely unrelated topic in the middle of a statement. In one statement he invented a word that he pronounced as "bigly" when he tried to describe something as being "enormous" or "colossal."   If a U.S, citizen has reasons to dislike both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, but looks at her/his vote as being for the lesser of two evils, how would that person rationalize a vote for Trump in view of the above observations? If a U.S. citizen decides not to vote or to vote for the Libertarian or other party as a protest, will that person be content knowing that either Donald Trump of Hillary Clinton will be their next president?

Costa Rica staff Truckers are upset because foreign drivers are transporting loads within Costa Rica. That is one of the complaints truck operators brought to Casa Presidencial Friday in a rolling protest. Like many other illegal activities, the central government does not seem to be able to execute the laws. The local truckers said they have no problem with foreigners bringing loads into and out of the country. But, clearly, foreign truckers do not have the right to work internally in Costa Rica, they note. Executive branch personnel have been meeting with the truckers and the Asociación Nacional de Empleados Públicos y Privados on this and other issues for months. The truckers also are upset by the long lines at border crossings caused by slow clearance at customs, they said. Casa Presidencial said that there have been advances in the speed of customs clearances at the borders and the development of a system for payment of fines by foreign truckers who are ticketed for infractions in Costa Rica. The truckers have been voicing complaints since June, and the government said that there have been 24 meetings on the topics. There also was a meeting with trucking leaders Friday morning after a parade of rigs showed up outside Casa Presidencial. Battle continues to rescue turtles targeted for meat By the A.M. Costa Rica staff The arrival of sea turtles on the Caribbean coast means free meat for some residents. Crew members of the Servicio Nacional de Guardacostas managed to save one turtle from hunters in the Pacuare section of Limón province. They made two arrests and liberated the turtle. Last week they managed to liberate four captured sea turtles that were headed for slaughter, they said. But police and members of the Guardacostas have been too late in other cases. One motorist was found carrying turtle meat in his car last week, and a similar batch of turtle meat was confiscated from the refrigerator of a Limón bar. Of course there is a continual fight to reduce the illegal sale of turtle eggs. In another animal-related development over the weekend,  Fuerza Pública officers reported they rescued a cougar cub whose mother had been shot by illegal hunters in San Gerardo de Santa María de Dota.

Costa Rica staff Law officers broke up the high seas transfer of 745 kilos of cocaine and detained seven persons last weekend. The law enforcement action took place in the Pacific some 60 miles off Cabo Blanco, the same place where last week more than a ton of cocaine was confiscated from another small boat. In the latest case, the Servicio Nacional de Guardacostas, the  Servicio de Vigilancia Aérea and the Unidad Especial de Intervención came upon cocaine being transferred from one boat to two smaller ones, said the Ministerio de Seguridad Pública. One boat has a Colombian captain and crew, said the ministry. The two smaller boats had two-man crews from Costa Rica and Nicaragua. The cocaine appears to have been headed for the Costa Rican mainland for shipment north over land. Meanwhile Sunday, the Policía de Fronteras and the Fuerza Pública chased and managed to stop two cars carrying 45 kilos of cocaine near Paso Canoas. The vehicle occupants fled.

Costa Rica's   Fifth news page San José, Costa Rica, Monday, Aug. 1, 2016, Vol. 17, No. 150 Calendar Opinion Classifieds Real Estate Lifestyle Food About us Leading candidates keep tight schedules on Sunday By the A.M. Costa Rica wire services Sunday is a traditional day of rest, but not if you are running for president of the United States. Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton was in Columbus, Ohio, the last stop on a three-day tour of Ohio and Pennsylvania, two industrial states political experts say are going to be key battlegrounds in the November election. "Donald Trump poses a serious threat to our democracy," she told the crowd, urging people not to listen to what she called her Republican rival's rhetoric and demagoguery. Mrs. Clinton visited factories in the two states where she said hard-working Americans are still making things, and said Trump should be ashamed of using factories in places such as México, Slovenia, and Bangladesh to make products with the Trump name on the label. Clinton admitted she is up against powerful forces, but did not refrain from telling the audience that the wealthy and Wall Street will finally pay their fair share of taxes to pay for her plans to create new jobs. Meanwhile, Trump is charging the Democrats with rigging the debate schedule in September and October so that two of the three debates are held at the same time as National Football League games. Football has a fanatical following in the United States and could attract a bigger television audience than the debates. Trump initially told ABC television's “This Week” broadcast that the NFL sent him a letter complaining about the schedule. But after the NFL denied sending a letter, a Trump aide said the candidate learned of the conflict from a source close to the league. The non-partisan Commission on Presidential Debates says it began working more than a year and a half ago to pick suitable dates to avoid other big events and religious holidays. It says it is impossible to avoid all sporting events. Trump holds campaign rallies Monday in two of the cities Mrs. Clinton just visited, Columbus and Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Mrs. Clinton will be in Omaha, Nebraska, and Boulder, Colorado. While Trump boasts that television ratings showed more viewers watched his nomination acceptance speech than Hillary Clinton's, Mrs. Clinton got a seven point post-convention bump in the polls. The Morning Consult organization reported Sunday that Mrs. Clinton leads Trump in voter preference 43 to 40 percent. Trump enjoyed a similar bump after the Republican convention and he briefly led the polls. The survey also shows 17 percent still are undecided. Dead Muslim soldier’s dad remains critical of Trump By the A.M. Costa Rica wire services The father of U.S. Army Capt. Humayun Khan has called on Republican leaders to repudiate Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump for comments seen by many as attempts to degrade the sacrifices of his late son and those of Muslim Americans in general. Speaking Sunday on national television, Khizr Khan described Trump as "totally unfit for the leadership of this beautiful country."  He also described the party nominee as possessing a black soul and called on Republicans Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan to speak out against their candidate. The senior Khan and his wife, Ghazala, first came to prominence at last week's Democratic nominating convention when the couple memorialized their son, who was killed by a suicide bomber in Iraq, and then strongly endorsed Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Khan, a Pakistani immigrant, said in an emotional speech that his family would never have been allowed to immigrate to the United States under Trump's proposed immigration policies. Khan added in a television interview Sunday that Trump lacked empathy and had sacrificed nothing and no one during his life, escalating a war of words on social media that soon reached a fevered pitch as Senate Majority leader McConnell and House Speaker Ryan sought to distance themselves from the controversy. In statements, the congressional leaders condemned any criticism of Muslim Americans who serve their country.  They also rejected Trump proposals for a ban on Muslims seeking entry to U.S. territories, but did so without mentioning Trump by name. Earlier, in an interview aired on ABC News, Trump said, "I think I've made a lot of sacrifices. I work very, very hard," creating "thousands and thousands of jobs. I think those are sacrifices, I think when I can employ thousands and thousands of people, take care of their education, take care of so many things."  The Republican contender also questioned why Ghazala Khan stood by her husband while he spoke at the convention and said nothing.  "Maybe she wasn't allowed to have anything to say," Trump said on Twitter. For her part, Ghazala Khan, writing in The Washington Post, said "walking onto the convention stage, with a huge picture of my son behind me, I could hardly control myself. What mother could?" She said her husband asked her if she wanted to speak, "but I told him I could not." "Donald Trump said he made a lot of sacrifices," she concluded. "He doesn't know what the word means." Trump's opponent in November polls, former U.S. secretary of State Hillary Clinton, again accused Trump of trying to inflame divisions in American society.  Speaking in Ohio, she said her opponent had a total misunderstanding of American values. Separately, leading U.S. veteran group organizer Paul Rieckoff called Trump's move to equate the sacrifice of creating jobs with those of people who had lost a son in combat insulting, foolish and ignorant. By midday Sunday, Trump, the real estate tycoon seeking public office for the first time,  sought to reframe his comments. "Captain Khan, killed 12 years ago, was a hero, but this is about Radical Islamic Terror and the weakness of our leaders to eradicate it," Trump said in one tweet. In another comment, Trump said, "I was viciously attacked by Mr. Khan at the Democratic convention. Am I not allowed to respond? Hillary voted for the Iraq war, not me!" As a U.S. senator, Mrs. Clinton voted along with other lawmakers in approving the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq that toppled Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein.  The invasion led to an eight-year war that many Americans came to oppose, including Mrs. Clinton. The premise for the U.S. invasion, that Saddam Hussein had amassed weapons of mass destruction, turned out to be unfounded. Four cases of zika found in southern United States By the A.M. Costa Rica wire services Zika-carrying mosquitos are believed to have reached the U.S. mainland, with at least four cases of local transmission reported in Florida. U.S. health officials sounded the warning on zika months ago, and confirmation of its arrival prompted a new round of finger pointing between Democratic and Republican lawmakers who have yet to approve funds to fight the virus or the mosquitos that spread it. “I call on GOP Congressional leadership to #doyourjob & interrupt recess to immediately address #Zika public health crisis,” tweeted Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, a Democrat. For most Americans, mosquitos are a summertime annoyance. Florida must now treat them as a public health menace. “Four people in our state likely have the virus as a result of a mosquito bite,” said Florida Gov. Rick Scott. “This means Florida has become the first state in our nation to have local transmission of the Zika virus.” Residents and visitors along America’s Gulf Coast are expressing varying degrees of apprehension. “It does concern me for my children and my grandchildren,” said Jimmy Stewart in Galveston, Texas. “But I don’t know if it’s going to do you any good to be real worried about it because, if it’s here, it’s here.” The Florida cases confirm what health officials predicted earlier this year: that zika, which can cause abnormalities in newborns, would one day be contracted from mosquitos found in large swaths of the United States. Congress adjourned in mid-July and will not get back to work until September. In February, the Obama administration requested $1.9 billion to fight zika. The Senate initially agreed to $1.1 billion of new spending. But negotiations between the Republican-led House and Senate yielded a bill with stipulations Democrats could not support concerning an abortion provider, the environment, and the display of the Confederate flag. “What did the Republican leadership in Congress produce? Unfortunately, it produced a package that is totally partisan and destined to fail, and they knew it,” said Richard Durbin of Illinois after banding together with other Democrats to block the Republican-backed legislation. “It’s inexplicable and unacceptable to not be able, on a bipartisan basis, to address this important public health care crisis,” lamented Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. “Every pregnant woman in America is following this issue. We need to act.” Experts expect zika-carrying mosquitos to spread beyond Florida. “Miami has a very similar climate as Houston,” said Todd Price, an infectious disease specialist. “Miami has the same mosquitos as Houston, and across the Gulf Coast. And so this is of urgency.” Lawmakers will continue the battle over zika funding when they return to Washington in September. For now, local and state governments must do the best they can to monitor and control mosquito populations with existing resources. Austin, Texas, is the scene of two shootings Sunday By the A.M. Costa Rica wire services A shooting early Sunday in a crowded entertainment district in the southern city of Austin, Texas has left one person dead and three others injured. Chief of Staff Brian Manley of the Austin Police said an unidentified gunman began shooting into the crowd after an initial disturbance, creating a chaotic scene. A search is underway for the suspect and the motive for the attack was not immediately clear. Police are asking the public for information, including videos, in an attempt to find the gunman, who is believed to be in his 20's. Moments after the shooting, Manley said a man opened fire several blocks away during a confrontation in a parking garage. Bystanders tackled the gunman, who was hospitalized for injuries sustained when he was apprehended. No one was believed to have been shot in that incident. Police originally thought the two shootings were related. But Manley said the initial investigation found they were two unrelated incidents. The recent targeting and killing of police officers during a peaceful march in Dallas, protesting police brutality, has police forces across the country, especially Texas, on high alert. Skydiver without parachute falls 7 kilometers safely By the A.M. Costa Rica wire services Safety tests on the net that would catch Luke Aikins indicated that the risk-motivated American skydiver might not survive the seven kilometer jump without a parachute. To come out alive, he had to navigate throwing himself from a plane above California's Simi Valley Saturday, reaching terminal velocity, 193 kilometers an hour, in a fall that lasted about two minutes, and land inside the 30 meter by 30 meter net awaiting him just above the desert floor. "If I wasn’t nervous, I would be stupid," he said ahead of the jump Saturday. "We’re talking about jumping without a parachute, and I take that very seriously. It’s not a joke." At least one trial run with a dummy failed with the weight crashing through the net. After two years of planning, trials and errors, though, the 42-year-old stunt man leaped from a Cessna along with three other skydivers who had parachutes and who recorded the descent and carried gear Aikins needed early in the jump, like an oxygen mask. Aikins fell spreadeagled, then rolled onto his back moments before impact. The net stretched low to cushion his fall as he entered record books as the first netted free fall from that height.  He lay motionless for several moments as the net was lowered to the ground. Then, Aikins sprang to his feet, arms victoriously in the air, and hugged his wife. "I'm almost levitating, it's incredible," he said after landing.   Access to firearms is seen related to suicide numbers By the Columbia University Medical Center news staff Researchers from Columbia University Medical Center and New York State Psychiatric Institute have found that legislation reducing access to firearms has lowered firearm suicide rates in other countries. This finding is based on evidence from around the world on the relationship between firearm ownership and firearm suicide rates. The report was published recently in the American Journal of Psychiatry. To reduce firearm suicide rates in the United States, the authors recommended several measures, such as targeted legislation to limit firearm access to individuals at risk for suicide, using smart gun technology, offering public education on firearm suicide, and research to evaluate the effectiveness of prevention methods. According to the authors, half of suicide deaths involve a firearm. In 2014, of the more than 33,500 firearm deaths in the United States, over 21,000 were the result of suicide. About 38 percent of U.S. households own at least one gun, making firearms widely available to those at risk of suicide. Their findings and recommendations were based on a review of case-control, ecological, and time-series studies from the United States and other countries. The researchers extrapolated from gun control measures implemented elsewhere in considering what might be possible and effective in preventing firearm suicides in the U.S. Studies in the U.S. showed that greater firearm availability is associated with greater risk of firearm suicide. Globally, four studies in other developed countries found that per capita gun ownership correlates with national firearm suicide rates. Over the three-year period from 2000 to 2002, the 15 states with the highest household firearm ownership, 47 percent, had almost twice as many suicides, 14,809, as the six states with the lowest firearm ownership, 15 percent, with 8,052 suicides. This difference in overall suicides is largely accounted for by the difference in firearm suicides, 9,749 compared with 2,606. Non-firearm suicides, 5,060 compared with 5,446, and the total populations of the two sets of states were comparable. While states vary widely in the stringency of their firearm laws, recent studies are encouraging about the potential benefits of targeted and multifaceted firearm restrictions, including purchasing permits, waiting periods, safe storage, gun violence restraining orders, background checks, and registration guidelines. All of these measures have been associated with lower firearm suicide rates and lower overall suicide rates. Smart gun technology, such as fingerprint recognition, limits use of a gun to the owner and permitted users. Mandating that new guns use the new technology and instituting trade-in programs to replace old guns with safer ones can prevent a household’s firearms from being used for suicide by family members or others with access to the firearm. Safe storage methods, keeping guns unloaded, methods of identifying individuals at risk of suicide, and changing the belief that a suicide is inevitable are among the public health messages that may help reduce firearm suicide rates. Social marketing initiatives to change public perceptions, similar to the successful campaigns to prevent driving while impaired, encourage seat belt use, and promote smoking cessation, may also prove valuable in reducing firearm suicide rates. “These findings illustrate the influence that social policy can have on medical conditions, in this case suicide,” noted Jeffrey Lieberman, chairman of the department of psychiatry at Columbia University Medical Center. Study said prejudice prevails despite level of intelligence By the Society for Personality and Social Psychology news staff  When it comes to prejudice, it does not matter if you are smart or not, or conservative or liberal, each group has their own specific biases. In a recent study, psychologists show that low cognitive ability, based on measures of intelligence and verbal ability, was not a consistent predictor of prejudice. Cognitive ability, whether high or low, only predicts prejudice towards specific groups. The results are published in the journal Social Psychological and Personality Science. “Very few people are immune to expressing prejudice, especially prejudice towards people they disagree with,” says lead author Mark Brandt of Tilburg University, The Netherlands. Brandt and Jarret Crawford of The College of New Jersey analyzed data from 5,914 people in the United States that includes a measure of verbal ability and prejudice towards 24 different groups. Analyzing the results, the researchers found that people with both relatively higher and lower levels of cognitive ability show approximately equal levels of intergroup bias, but towards different sets of groups. People with low cognitive ability tended to express prejudice towards groups perceived as liberal and unconventional, such as atheists, gays and lesbians, as well as groups of people perceived as having low choice over group membership, such as ethnic minorities. People with high cognitive ability showed the reverse pattern. They tended to express prejudice towards groups perceived as conservative and conventional, such as Christians, the military and big business. “There are a variety of belief systems and personality traits that people often think protect them from expressing prejudice,” says Brandt. “In our prior work we found that people high and low in the personality trait of openness to experience show very consistent links between seeing a group as different from them and expressing prejudice towards that group. The same appears to be true for cognitive ability. ” “Whereas prior work by others found that people with low cognitive ability express more prejudice, we found that this is limited to only some target groups,” says Brandt. “For other target groups the relationship was in the opposite direction. For these groups, people with high levels of cognitive ability expressed more prejudice. So, cognitive ability also does not seem to make people immune to expressing prejudice.” The authors would like to see if their findings will replicate in new samples, with new target groups, and additional measures of cognitive ability. “We used a measure of verbal ability, which is essentially a vocabulary test,” says Brandt. “Although this measure correlates pretty well with other measures of cognitive ability it is not a perfect nor a complete measure.” Real estate-related services (paid category) New shipping containers for sale: 20 ft.

Still, they have been introduced into just about every area where the climate permits and the leaves and fruits are frequently found in local markets so they are definitely worth discussing. The thing I really like about both these plants is that the leaves can be used in a mixed vegetable dish. In this disguise, Metric Man doesn’t notice them. He also doesn’t notice them in salads and, since he avoids veggies whenever he can, this is a great way to get him to eat them. And they are so good for you: High in vitamins, especially A and C, plus B complex, plus trace elements, and protein. Wow, not bad for a fast growing nice looking little plant. Did I say little?  Katuk grows to 2.5 meters (9 feet) and moringa can grow to 10 meters (33 feet). Katuk is usually grown as an annual but moringa? Trim it to size or let it grow to a tree. Enough about tall things, what about vines? The Passiflora genus (passion flower), with over 500 species and flowers of many different colors, also produces a great fruit. The three most common are the sweet granadilla, giant granadilla and purple passion fruit. The first has a hard rind and is usually sipped from the rind or split and the pulp spooned out. The giant granadilla has an edible rind and can be eaten fresh from the vine or made into jams. It is also a terrific addition to smoothies. The purple passion fruit is also great in smoothies and other beverages although the seeds can be an astringent. And how about cacti? The hylocereus cosarricensis, or pitaya, is a native of Costa Rica. If you have a cacti or succulent garden, this night bloomer is highly fragrant and then you can harvest and eat the fruits. Oddly this cactus is a tree climber so you will need to provide it with the support of a trellis as it grows. You may be able to harvest the dragonfruit four or five times a year, depending on your climate. The pitaya likes a nice hot dry place to live. So there you are, local and introduced plants that are both interesting and edible. I promise not to neglect them in the future. Plant of the Week Despite multiple invasions of the caterpillars from Hell, my passion flower vines produced a lot of fruit. This variety will be yellow when ripe and can be picked from the vine or gathered from the ground. Washed and dried, they can be refrigerated for two or three weeks, or you can freeze the pulp or juice for later use. Great in a smoothie!

Home Menu Search Facebook Twitter RSS Currently 34.8 °F Friday January 6th, 2017 8:56PM 5:52PM ( 3 hours ago ) Weather Alert Winter storm warning continues until 1 p.m. Saturday; forecasters say expect snow accumulations and windy conditions Posted 9:52PM on Thursday 1st September 2016 ( 4 months ago ) Hermine's approach impossible to escape in southern Georgia share tweet +1 By The Associated Press   Contact Editor VALDOSTA, Ga. (AP) — From rural farm communities to coastal beaches, southern Georgia residents found it impossible Thursday to escape the approach of Hurricane Hermine. Gov. Nathan Deal declared a state of emergency for 56 counties that were under a tropical storm warning. The area bracing for powerful winds and heavy rains from the storm nearly covered the southern half of the state. Holly Murkerson started the day on the coast in Savannah, where the conference she was attending got cancelled because of the oncoming storm. So she headed home to Cairo, a rural town 240 miles to the southwest — and also under the storm warning. "They said, 'Hey, get out of here. It's going to get rough,'" said Murkerson, who was preparing for the possibility of several days without electricity when she got home. She and her husband stopped Thursday evening at a Wal-Mart in Valdosta, where they bought bread, lunch meat and 105 bottles of water. Hermine was forecast to make landfall in northwest Florida and quickly push into southern Georgia by early Friday. Valdosta, located about 15 miles north of the Florida line, was one of the first Georgia communities in the storm's predicted path. Workers in Valdosta and surrounding Lowndes County spent much of Thursday clearing storm drains and roadside ditches in hopes of alleviating flooding from an anticipated 7 to 9 inches of rain. With winds at or near hurricane strength expected as the storm passed Friday morning, officials were urging most residents to stay put. "Most of it's going to be trying to get people to stay hunkered down at home," said Bill Slaughter, the Lowndes County commission chairman. Not everybody felt safe under their own roofs. About a dozen people showed up Thursday evening to stay at a Red Cross shelter that opened at a city auditorium normally used for banquets and gospel concerts. Cynthia Arnold left her mobile home to check into the shelter with her brother and her 5-year-old grandson. She said her husband and a teenage nephew stayed behind. "I'm not just going to sit there and be ignorant," Arnold said. The storm's greatest effect on Georgia could be heavy rainfall, Georgia Emergency Management and Homeland Security Agency officials said. Director Jim Butterworth said the storm could bring flooding, tornadoes and power outages. The storm was upgraded to a hurricane Thursday afternoon, and was expected to strike the Florida coast late Thursday or early Friday. Schools and colleges across southern Georgia canceled classed Friday, and many government offices planned to close. The state's busy seaports in Savannah and Brunswick will shut down ahead of the storm as a precaution, said Griff Lynch, executive director of the Georgia Ports Authority.

The changes will be rolled out over the rest of this year and into 2017.

The program provided students with two gift cards: one that allowed kids to purchase new school shoes at Payless ShoeSource, which was funded through a Salvation Army grant, and a second — through local donations — for school supplies at places like Staples and Walmart. “We get donations from residents, churches, groups here in town,” said Human Services Director Sarah Heath. “They give us donations, and they’re either the actual gift card or they’re cash donations and we purchase the gift cards.” More Information Information for families Tax-deductible monetary donations made payable to “Town of Westport/DHS Family Programs” (memo: Back to School) may be mailed to Department of Human Services, 110 Myrtle Ave., Westport, CT 06880. Gift cards of any amount to Staples, Target, Walmart, Old Navy, etc. are appreciated as well and may be dropped off Monday through Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. in Room 200 at Westport Town Hall. 　 Families who feel they may qualify for this program are urged to contact the Department of Human Services at 203-341-1050. “We also get donations of actual school supplies, and we do give those out. But we find that the families like being able to do the back-to-school shopping with their children themselves, which is why the gift card is nice,” Heath said. Many families signed up almost immediately for the program, and Heath attributes the program’s success to the community’s involvement. “We get a lot of parents who are surprised to be getting the gift cards, and that’s from generosity from the Salvation Army and from Westport residents, who are extremely generous,” Heath said. “And that’s the only reason we are able to do this. There are a lot of towns that just give a backpack and paper or pens and pencils, but this program has grown every year and developed so that we’re able to offer each family those two gift cards.” Because there is no free or reduced lunch at most summer camps, many families living paycheck to paycheck find themselves financially strapped when it comes time to start school. “They are able to go to Payless and get a pair of shoes. Not having to worry about where the funds are coming from, for back to school, I think, is very helpful,” Heath said.

It was 7 p.m., and we had been shopping since the stores had opened that morning. The first place we stopped was the Apple Store, where I spent over a thousand bucks in less than 15 minutes, buying Anna a new laptop that was required for her major. After that we hit Zara, H&M, Macy’s, JC Penney, Target, Walmart, Bed Bath & Beyond, JoAnn Fabrics, TJ Maxx and HomeGoods. “What’s another $20 bucks at this point?” I replied to Anna, in utter defeat and near starvation. “Definitely get three.” Two weeks later, we pulled up to her dorm at Syracuse University – our minivan packed to the gills with fluffy new bedding, posters, a clip-on lamp, school supplies, a throw rug, a shower caddy, towels, a desk set, a fan, pop-up laundry bins, six months worth of toiletries, various snacks, cases of bottled water, a microwave, a coffee maker, and yes, three decorative pillows. Happy, helpful sophomores garbed in blazing orange, whose parents had been victims of “The Dorm Room Shakedown,” the previous year, were awaiting our arrival with huge rolling bins to cart thousands of dollars worth of unnecessary products up to assigned rooms. “Hi!” they shouted with rehearsed enthusiasm, shaking us out of our road trip stupor, “I’m Sean/Cassandra/Matt! I’d love to help you move in!” They filled two of the rolling carts to capacity, and then guided us like sheep to slaughter to the dorm elevators. In the newfangled co-ed hallway, Anna found her room, which was a “split double” – one room separated down the middle by a wall of closets and dressers. This gave Anna and her roommate their own private spaces within one room. Anna’s roommate had already moved in, and her side was so spectacular. It looked like something straight out of a Pottery Barn catalogue. Concerned that Anna’s room would look like a cell at Rikers Island by comparison, we quickly unloaded everything we’d already purchased, and left to find the nearest Target. Two-hundred more bucks later, we added modern shelving, storage bins, two strings of twinkle lights, curtains, a coat rack, hangers, plastic drawers and a bowl of fresh fruit. Before saying good-bye to Anna, the next day, we all went to her dining hall to take advantage of the free lunch offered to new parents. I contemplated filling my purse with chicken tenders to supplement the beans and rice we’d be eating at home for the next six months, but selected a modest plateful of quinoa-spinach-mango salad and coconut shrimp instead. “You know, Anna,” Francis said, between mouthfuls of made-to-order chicken salad panini, “when I went to college, all I brought was the blue quilt off my bed and a Journey poster. And our dining hall only had things like casseroles and meatloaf. Do you have any idea how lucky you are?” Looking confused, Anna chomped her gourmet veggie pizza, and said, “Want anything from the froyo bar?” When it was all said and done, Anna’s room looked better than the hotel room we stayed in at the Syracuse Holiday Inn, and she had much better coffee. But then again, our hotel was only $100 with our military discount. I guess the old adage is true: you get what you pay for. Or, in this case, your college kids get what you pay for.

 It's time we reinvented labor for the 21st century Thomas Kochan, The Conversation Sep. 2, 2016, 8:22 PM 1,391 facebook linkedin twitter email print Employers can get ahead by investing in their workers, with higher wages. Rebecca Cook/Reuters On Labor Day, politicians have traditionally paid lip service to the plight of the worker, whom the national holiday is meant to honor. With working-class struggles taking center stage in this year’s election, we will likely hear from them more than usual talking about the steps they will take to reduce income inequality or end three decades of wage stagnation. Some of them will go one step further and voice support for unions and collective bargaining, both of which have declined at the same time wages have stagnated. They do so for good reason. Not only have American workers made it clear they are fed up with being left behind as the economy prospers, there is a growing body of evidence that union decline is one of the key causes of wage stagnation and income inequality. The solution, however, isn’t to bring back the unions of yesterday. We need to create stronger business-labor partnerships for tomorrow. Slide of union power Southwest Airlines follows a “high road” economic strategy by investing in its workers. Rick Wilking/Reuters As far back at the mid-1980s, our research at MIT showed that collective bargaining was no longer capable of using the threat of strikes or other forms of pressure to get businesses to match negotiated wage increases. Previously, strike threats and the fear of getting organized led companies to match wages negotiated in key bargains. For example, in the late 1940s, General Motors and the United Auto Workers negotiated a wage formula linking wage hikes to increases in productivity and the cost of living. Unionized businesses had to follow suit or risk a strike. Even companies without unions had to do the same if they wanted to avoid their workers getting organized. Recent research shows that the decline in union bargaining power observed in the 1980s has persisted and has now taken a big toll on union and nonunion workers alike. A just-released report from liberal-leaning think tank the Economic Policy Institute, for example, estimates that the decline in unions – from 23 percent in 1979 to 11 percent in 2013 – and their collective bargaining power has caused men in the private sector to earn US$109 billion less every year and women to earn $24 billion less. Other recent research shows that the decline in wages has now spread to the public sector. Teachers have been especially hard hit. In 1979, teachers earned just 2 percent less than comparable college graduates. In 2015, the earnings gap had widened to 17 percent. More than empty rhetoric? The old manufacturing jobs won’t come back. Instead the government could help support jobs making tomorrow’s technologies, like wearable tech. Elijah Nouvelage/Reuters Research like this has convinced more Democratic candidates to call for rebuilding labor unions. But is that possible or is it just empty rhetoric? As I’ve argued before, I believe it is empty for two reasons. First, since 1978 three major efforts to pass labor law reform to make it easier to form a union have been blocked in Congress. And there is no reason to believe this will change. Second, even if unions started growing again, they would not be able to rely on their past sources of power to drive up wages. There is just too much domestic and international competition, and it is too easy to move capital and jobs to lower-wage countries. That makes it much harder to use strike or unionizing threats to get businesses to lift wages or match negotiated increases. So what else can be done? In previous articles, I’ve made the case for a new labor policy that not only supports unions but also promotes labor management partnerships. I’ve also suggested extending protection against employer retaliation to more workers, such as fast-food employees fighting for a $15 minimum wage or independent contractors like Uber or Lyft drivers. These changes would help reframe labor policy to fit the modern economy. Uber driver Karim Amrani sits in his car parked near the San Francisco International Airport parking area in San Francisco. Jeff Chiu/AP But labor policy can no longer stand alone. A more complete strategy is needed that integrates a revised labor policy with something known as a “high road” economic strategy. At MIT, my colleagues and I teach this approach to our MBA students, in executive education classes and in our public online courses. We tell current and future business executives that they have a choice in how they compete in the marketplace: They can minimize labor costs and fight to keep unions out of their organizations or they can invest in their workers, drawing on their knowledge, skills and motivation to achieve high levels of productivity and customer service. And then reward those employees with their fair share of the profits they help produce. Over the past two decades, researchers have discovered how companies employing this “high-road” approach – such as retailers like Costco or Market Basket, airlines like Southwest or health care providers like Kaiser Permanente – do just as well or even better on long-term financial returns, customer service and wages than “low-road” competitors, such as Walmart or Spirit Airlines. The task ahead Protesters rally during demonstrations asking for higher wages in the Manhattan borough of New York Thomson Reuters How can we encourage more companies to move in this direction? As educators, we have an important role to play, but our efforts need to be matched by a well-coordinated effort that cuts across the federal government and business to realize the benefits of a high-road policy. One example is repairing America’s decaying infrastructure through public-private partnerships, which some business and labor leaders have already committed to. The same deal needs to be struck in implementing a new manufacturing policy. We are not likely to bring back many of the jobs lost to China and other lower-wage countries. The best way for government to help rebuild our manufacturing base is to support investments in next generation technologies, such as light metals, photonics, robotics and wearable fibers that will generate energy and cool our bodies. But it’s also important to insist the businesses getting federal funding commit to making their products here and investing in their workforces. So this Labor Day, I believe candidates need to go beyond the empty rhetoric of the past and commit to doing the hard work of recasting labor policy in ways it might be possible to enact. And then they should follow up with the comprehensive and disciplined administrative actions needed to realize a high-road strategy that puts the economy on a course that will truly work for all.

The big question now for neighborhood residents is, “What next?” Some partial answers may come this week when dispossessed building owner Jaswant Singh’s attorney and court-appointed New Grand Save receiver Mark Adams face off Thursday morning in a Stockton courtroom before Judge Barbara Kronlund. Could Singh have his way, with the judge clearing the path for his desired sale of the New Grand Save site to developers who say they will open a Family Dollar store at the southeast corner of Ninth Street and Airport Way? Or will Adams, who was granted receivership by Kronlund on June 28, retain the judge’s approval and continue moving forward with his planning for the rehabilitation and re-purposing of the New Grand Save site? A community survey of about 200 local residents following the closure found the greatest local sentiment favored the opening of a 24-hour medical/urgent care facility. Still, the future is unwritten. A timeline and court documents from the past two-plus months tell an intriguing tale of the events leading to this week’s hearing. June 28: Singh is represented in court by Sacramento attorney Brian DeAmicis, who is patched in by teleconference at the last minute because the New Grand Save owner’s regular lawyer, Judy Lovett, is on vacation. At the end of the hearing, Kronlund verbally approves Adams as the receiver. The city shuts down the store three days later. July 19: Kronlund files her written order. It enjoins Singh from “transferring or encumbering any interests in the Nuisance Property” and orders Singh to “immediately surrender possession and control,” which, in fact, he already had done. Aug. 11: Lovett files a document saying the city “purposefully (scheduled) the (June 28) hearing” knowing she would be on vacation. “The City deprived (Singh) of a fair hearing,” she writes. Lovett adds that there was “inadequate time to fully prepare” DeAmicis. Reached last week, DeAmicis declined comment. Aug. 12: Lovett files a motion with Kronlund to overturn the receivership or permit Singh to complete an agreement he reached in March with developers who say they will replace New Grand Save with a Family Dollar store. Singh says he is worried he will be sued by the developers if he cannot finalize the deal. “The receivership is going to destroy the equity that I have in this property,” he writes. Aug. 12: In another filing the same day, attorney Richard Feld, representing developer FD Partners, writes that his clients will renovate New Grand Save in full accordance with Stockton Municipal Codes. Feld also downplays a $307,000 hazardous materials fine paid by Family Dollar earlier this year, stating it was minimal compared to fines against other chain stores, including retail giant Walmart — which was fined $20 million. Family Dollar, with two stores in Stockton and about 130 statewide, has been a good citizen since it paid its penalty, Feld also writes. An interesting side note: The case against Family Dollar was filed in Yolo County, but the judge who made the ruling was Kronlund, the same judge overseeing the New Grand Save case. Aug. 19: Adams files an inventory of merchandise at New Grand Save on the day it was closed. Total value: $187,000, more than $100,000 of it alcoholic beverages, tobacco products and soda and energy drinks. Aug. 24: Attorneys representing the city file a document in which they object to the Family Dollar deal; oppose the overturning of Adams’ receivership; and state that Lovett should have sought a continuance if she was concerned about DeAmicis’ preparedness. The attorneys also weigh in on Family Dollar. “The City and the community cannot risk another bad actor taking ownership of the Nuisance Property,” they write. Aug. 26: Adams files a report with the court. It says needed repairs at New Grand Save, including a new roof and electrical rewiring, would cost “several hundred thousand dollars.” He also writes, “There is the prospect of a very reputable possible user for this site assuming the court confirms my non-consent to the Family Dollar store transaction.” In an interview last week, Adams said a specific potential user has been expressing interest in the New Grand Save site, though he declined to publicly discuss the details. More probably will be learned in court Thursday, if not sooner. — Contact reporter Roger Phillips at (209) 546-8299 or rphillips@recordnet.com.

Are your hands itching to hold the iPhone 7 before its official announcement on Wednesday? Is your wallet in disagreement with this desire? Marketwatch has a clever solution. If you can part with your current iPhone right now, just a few days before Wednesday's announcement, you might be able to get top dollar for it on various electronic resale sites. The going rate for a 16 GB iPhone 6 in good condition is somewhere between $200 (on Walmart's trade-in site) and $326 on Glyde (which then charges an $88 fee). For a 128 GB iPhone 6s Plus, the prices can range from $450 to $567. But that price is going to plummet once the new phone is out. "We expect around a 15% decline in pricing for old iPhone models around the expected September launch," Glyde spokesman Matthew Reardon told Marketwatch. The new iPhone is rumored to include a number of changes, including an extra camera lens, an extra speaker replacing the headphone jack, and a new home button technology. Marketwatch estimates that pricing will be similar to that of the last release: $299 for a 32 GB iPhone 7 with a new two-year contract. (Add the cost of ending a contract early if you haven't finished your last one.) The trick is having a phone to use between when you sell your (not very) old phone and when you stand in line for the new one. According to Marketwatch, resale sites Nextworth and Gazelle offer grace periods (30 days and 45 days, respectively) between when you sign the contract and when you send in your phone. If you have an old iPhone 4 or 5 sitting in a drawer somewhere, ready to use as backup, you might be perfectly poised to make this transition.

Here's an annotated version. By Adele M. Stan / AlterNet September 2, 2016 Print Comments Photo Credit: a katz / Shutterstock.com This piece has been updated since its initial posting. On Saturday, Donald Trump visited one of Detroit’s major African-American churches as part of his purported outreach to black voters. Many commentators say this plan is really about increasing his appeal to white voters in swing districts who may feel uncomfortable voting for the Republican presidential nominee because of his harsh and often insensitive rhetoric on racial issues and his ties to the racist alt-right movement. To prepare Trump for his grilling by Bishop Wayne T. Jackson of the Great Faith Ministeries International Church, the candidate's staff, along with aides at the Republican National Committee, prepared answers for him to deliver, which were leaked to the New York Times. But the prepared answers were so un-Trumplike that I couldn't help but imagine what the Republican presidential nominee would really like to say. So I've taken the liberty, below, of adding into the script what past evidence suggests the candidate might actually be thinking. My Trumpian additions appear in bold. Trump’s Michigan visit is expected to include a tour of Detroit with Ben Carson, Trump’s former rival for the Republican nomination, as his guide. Carson, a pioneering neurosurgeon, is also African American and grew up in a family that was financially strapped. Before Trump embarking on his scheduled tour, Trump attended a service at the Great Faith Ministries International Church, where he was scheduled to sit for an interview with Jackson that was initially reported as being closed to the press and the general public. (That restriction apparently changed by the time Trump visited the church Saturday.) The bishop’s questions, reports the New York Times, were submitted in advance. According to the Times, "And instead of letting Mr. Trump be his freewheeling self, his campaign prepared lengthy answers for the submitted questions, consulting black Republicans to make sure he says the right things." Those answers were published by the Times on Friday. My Trumpian additions appear in bold; occasionally I imagine Trump crossing out the speechwriter’s text and supplanting it with his own, in which case, you'll see a strikethru and replacement text in bold. Q. Are you a Christian and do you believe the Bible is an inspired word of God? As I went through my life, things got busy with business, but my family kept me grounded to the truth and the word of God. I treasure my relationship with my family, and through them, I have a strong faith enriched by an ever-wonderful a great God. A really tremendous God. Tremendous, my God. Believe me. Dr. James Dobson called me “a baby Christian,” but really I’m a very successful Christian. Very, very successful. So tremendously successful that I’m speaking next week at the big, Christian Values Voter Summit—I love the evangelicals—despite my three marriages and involvement in the gambling industry. Who else gets to do all those things? Q. Mr. Trump, there is racial divide in our country and it is evident that the tension is boiling over. Case in point: Reverend Pinckney in South Carolina was gunned down when a white young man came into their Bible Study and slaughtered the Reverend and eight other individuals because he wanted to start a race war. What would your administration do to bring down the racial tension that is in our country? In the Bible Jesus said that a house divided cannot stand. Our best hope for erasing racial tensions in America is to work toward a color-blind society. In business, we hire, retain and award based on merit. So, what you have in the African-American community: a merit problem. That’s why only six CEOs of Fortune 500 companies are African American. Great, great people those six. Unbelievable people. In society, however, we have divisions that can only be eliminated if we have equal opportunity and then equal access to programs and institutions that will lift all people in the country. I’m talking about the ones with merit, right? Remember that. Like the merit of having a dad who gives you a $1 million to start a business. Fatherhood. So important. We have to reform our tax system so that we can spur economic growth for the long haul. It’s disgusting that my kids will have to pay taxes on my estate if I ever die. But no plans yet for that big escalator in the sky. None. Remember that. We have to have stronger enforcement of immigration laws. If I can just pit you people against the Hispanics, maybe you’ll all stay home on November 8. Then I win. I win big-league. We have to renegotiate our trade deals so that we can bring advantage back to the American workforce. But perhaps most important is that we must provide equal opportunity for a quality education for all Americans. I know about quality education. I used to have a university. A great, great university. Don’t believe the Mexican judge. So unfair. The higher the educational attainment, the greater the likelihood one can climb the economic ladder. We must bring school choice programs to our cities and we must get rid of Common Core. Imagine a flood of tax dollars to schools like Trump University. So great. We must make sure that access, affordability and accountability are brought into our higher education system. That’s where the tentacles come in. I have a great tentacles plan for education. Tentacles—so important. Like I told Hannity, the Department of Education can largely be eliminated, but you still want to have a little bit of tentacles out there. No, not the Japanese porn kind. We’ll work on that when we renegotiate the trade deals. Without a focus on educational outcomes for every American, we will perpetuate the permanent underclass that progressive policies have sustained. Permanent underclass—that’s you, right? You with your drugs and poverty and shootings? Sad! Republicans like me Republicans like me? Kellyanne, you’re fired! You’re kidding, right? There are no Republicans like me! Ask Priebus. Great guy. Switzerland. need to have the courage to speak the truth free-associate about where we are and what has to be done. We have to have the courage to go into communities and work with everyone there to make sure that our schools are good and that our children have access to the whatever educational situation they may need. This is not something one person can do, but it is something that we can do together. I alone can fix it. Mr. Trump, there is a perception that your administration is racist. With many of the African-American voters their belief is that the Republican Party as a whole does not cater to African-American needs. In 2008 and 2012 we had two Republican candidates, John McCain and Mitt Romney, and neither one of them came to Detroit, or any urban area that I can remember to even address the concerns of our community. First, I would like to commend you for coming to our community as a Republican candidate. Second, I need to know, how would you change that perception in our community? Reverend, I think the term is “alt right.” Right, Bannon? I mean, you made the platform, right? So great, my CEO. The proof, as they say, will be in the pudding. [Or the sweet potato pie. Come to Trump Tower Grill and get a slice of the best sweet potato pie you’ve ever had in my restaurant. I love the African Americans! I have a great relationship with the blacks.] Coming into a community is meaningless unless we can offer an alternative to the horrible progressive agenda that has perpetuated a permanent underclass in America. [I mean, just look at your pathetic lives. You live in poverty, your schools are no good, you have no jobs. Let me do for you what I did for Atlantic City. What the hell do you have to lose? We need to be true to our word—who wrote this crap?!!!—and offer all Americans more opportunities so that each and every one of them can reach their full potential. This means economic policies that will bring millions and millions of jobs back to America and will raise wages for all. This means working hard to provide as many educational options as possible to our parents and children. This means cleaning up drugs This will happen when I build the wall, because you know what those people bring in, right? And you know who’s going to pay for the wall? Go ahead, say it! Feels good, right? Remember that] and making our neighborhoods and communities safer by making sure all the good guys have guns. When everybody has a gun, believe me, it will be a beautiful, beautiful sight, folks. Believe me. We need to get people off welfare—except for all those Walmart workers. Because America needs opportunity, right? And your people need cheap stuff, what with all the poverty and no-good education and no jobs. Sad!—and back to work. OK, so the majority of people on public assistance are in households headed by someone who works. They can get a third job with all the opportunity they’re going to have. So many opportunities. Because, like I told MSNBC last year, the minimum wage is too high. Bad for the economy—which I’m totally going to fix. Opportunity. So important. We need to make sure that anyone who qualifies can go into a bank, get a loan and then start a business. Just like me. Qualified at Bank of Dad. Great bank. Fantastic bank. We need to reduce regulations and expand options for people who want to be independent of government. We need to make sure that people can worship how they want and where they want without worrying that some federal agency is going to threaten the religious liberties. Except for the Muslims that are already here; they'll have to register with the federal government so we can track them in our database. And I’ll tell you one thing you’re not going to see–any new ones coming in, right? ISIS, destoyed. Make American safe again! Republicans I alone have better options. We just need to have the courage to present them with conviction. Mr. Trump, what is your vision for America? And specifically Black America? If you repeal Obamacare what is your plan to provide health care and medicine to those who can’t afford it, yet need it the most? As president, I must serve all Americans without regard to race, ethnicity or any other qualification. Just ask my African American over here. Neurosurgeon. Brain doctor. Smart guy. Very, very smart. Major merit. And mine. I must approach my task with the utmost wisdom and make sure that all Americans have opportunities to achieve to their potential. Like I said back in ’89, a black guy with a degree has an advantage over a white. Just ask Ben here. If we are to Make America Great Again, we must reduce, rather than highlight, issues of race in this country. I want to make race disappear as a factor in government and governance. I totally made race disappear as a factor in a housing project my dad built. Put it in a drawer. Every individual, regardless of race or ethnicity, must have access to the full array of opportunities in America. My vision for America is that every citizen and legal resident of this nation will be able to stand side by side and be proud of the fact that they live in the greatest nation on earth because I alone have Made America Great Again. Remember that. As for the Affordable Care Act, I will work to repeal the act and replace it with market-driven solutions that will offer more access to healthcare at more affordable prices. It’s working great in the pharmaceutical industry! Business. So important. Every American should be able to purchase health insurance across state lines, have health savings account that belong to them, have price transparency so they can shop for the best services at the best prices and know that they will not have to compete with those who are clogging the system simply because they are in this country illegally. OK, so maybe those people aren’t allowed to buy health insurance through Obamacare. But they’re still clogging the system. You know that. You know that. Believe me. Remember that. We want to block grant Medicaid so that states can provide services closer to the people [or not provide them at all. States’ rights—so important]. We want to make sure that every American has great economic opportunity so that they can seek out their own health insurance and still be able to afford it.This approach will serve all Americans and will ensure that more Americans are covered by better insurance and healthcare options. The ones with merit will get the better insurance and options. You can count on it. Merit—so important. Mr. Trump, I am a registered Democrat, but I am an undecided voter in this election for 2016. It is not only myself but there has been a lot of pastors and African Americans who have not made up their minds concerning who they are going to cast their vote for. The latest polls indicate that you have 1 percent of the African American vote. What can you say to undecided voters such as myself and others in the African American Community that will win our vote on November 8, 2016? And beyond winning, why is the African American vote important to you? All votes are important to me and my campaign. Your vote, your neighbor’s vote, the vote of every American is critical and I must do all I can to make sure you know that if you vote for me, you are voting for a stronger, more vibrant America. My policies offer you a clear choice. You can continue down the road of progressivism that has created a permanent underclass in this country that, unfortunately, includes far too many people of color. If you want a better America, you must break from the historical hold that Democrats have had on people of color and move to options that allow you to achieve your potential. This is all about opportunity — not sub-standard outcomes and promises of things to come that never materialize. The progressives have worked tirelessly to bring all Americans down to one level rather than allowing as many as possible to rise as high as possible. Education, jobs, religious liberty and protection of civil rights are the promises that I will keep, not just utter to gain favor. If you are interested in a greater America with more opportunity, liberty and prosperity, you must take a chance and walk over to my side.

It’s about to get better at the multiplex. Here are 10 movies, performances and story lines that AP film writers Lindsey Bahr and Jake Coyle are most looking forward to, come autumn: Lonergan-mania: Little is settled about this fall’s coming awards season except for this: Kenneth Lonergan’s “Manchester by the Sea” is one of the best films of the year. Already celebrated at its Sundance premiere, it’s the third film from the acclaimed New York playwright following the wonderful “You Can Count on Me” and the criminally underseen “Margaret.” Casey Affleck excels as a small-town New Englander haunted by tragedy. Lonergan’s naturalistic touch and deft feel for the rhythms and details of life remain unmatched. Ang Lee, innovator: Ang Lee is continually pushing cinema to new technological heights, and his adaptation of “Billy Lynn’s Long Halftime Walk” is no less ambitious than bringing a hyper realistic CG Bengal tiger to the frames of “Life of Pi.” The first screening will be in 4K, 3D and 120 frames per second — essentially, hyper reality. Oh, and he also manages to meld all that tech talk with some extremely resonant stories. A more diverse Oscars: After two straight years of “OscarsSoWhite” blanketing a dishearteningly homogenous Academy Awards, a richly diverse array of possible nominees is lining up for this season. Though a rape case from the past is clouding the once-bright fortunes of Nate Parker’s “The Birth of a Nation,” a revamped Academy of Motion Pictures may be hard pressed to ignore the likes of Denzel Washington’s “Fences,” Barry Jenkins’ “Moonlight,” Theodore Melfi’s “Hidden Figures” and Jeff Nichols’ interracial marriage tale “Loving.” Female directors to (re)discover: While the percentage of female directors remains dismal, there are a number of exciting projects from new and veteran talents this fall, like the feature debuts of Julia Hart (“Miss Stevens”) and Kelly Fremon Craig (“The Edge of Seventeen”). Also coming are films from exciting veterans like Jocelyn Moorehouse (“The Dressmaker”), Andrea Arnold (“American Honey”) and Kelly Reichardt (“Certain Women”). A legitimately good Shia Labeouf: Performance-art theatrics have overshadowed the transformation Shia LaBeouf has undergone. He’s made it easy to not take him seriously in recent years, and maybe that’s been the point. But in Andrea Arnold’s Midwest teenage odyssey, “American Honey,” LaBeouf and breakout star Sasha Lane are exceptional. The film is your opportunity to 1) See why LaBeouf was sporting a rattail last year; 2) Watch him dance to Rihanna on a Walmart check-out counter; and 3) See the vibrant latest from one of the most interesting directors currently working. Emma Stone gets a proper showcase: How do you come off of a dud like “Aloha”? By singing, dancing and romancing your way back into America’s hearts in what could be a career-defining performance in Damien Chazelle’s musical love story “La La Land” of course. Stone stars as Mia, a struggling actress in Los Angeles who falls for a moody musician in the form of Ryan Gosling. Looking like “Singing in the Rain” meets “The Umbrellas of Cherbourg,” “La La Land” — and Stone’s touching melodies and emotive almond eyes — promises to have audiences swooning and sobbing in no time. Smarter spectacles: Even the blockbusters this fall look more enticing than the summer’s. There’s Denzel in glorious cowboy-hero mode in “The Magnificent Seven,” Peter Berg’s visceral true tale “Deepwater Horizon,” the brainy smarts of Benedict Cumberbatch in “Doctor Strange,” the mind-bending sci-fi of Denis Villeneuve’s “Arrival” and the cozy fantasy of J.K. Rowling’s “Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.” Oh, and another little “Star Wars” film is coming: Gareth Edwards’ spinoff “Rogue One: A Star Wars Story.” Old Hollywood through Beatty’s lens: The Golden Age of Hollywood holds a not-so-surprising allure for directors of a certain age, but perhaps none has seemed quite as suited to the task as Warren Beatty, coming off of a 15-year hiatus from acting and an 18-year break from directing with his long-time-coming “Rules Don’t Apply,” once simply known as the Warren Beatty Howard Hughes pic. Beatty plays Hughes, but it looks to be more of a showcase for a youthful romance between an aspiring actress (Lily Collins) and her driver (young Han Solo himself, Alden Ehrenreich). Hailee Steinfeld grows up: Steinfeld was just 13 when she made her Oscar-nominated breakout in the Coen brothers “True Grit” in 2010. In Kelly Fremon Craig’s “The Edge of Seventeen” (November 18) — a coming-of-age tale in the John Hughes tradition — her maturation is self-evident. As a whip-smart but confidence-lacking high-schooler, Steinfeld navigates embarrassment after embarrassment with wit and spirit. The understated Mike Mills: Director Mike Mills takes his time between projects, but each is a lovely, whispered little cinematic event, from the tender “Thumbsucker” to the achingly poignant “Beginners.” His latest, “20th Century Women” takes him back in time to 1979 Santa Barbara, where three women (Annette Bening, Greta Gerwig and Elle Fanning) explore what love and freedom means in their time.

Let’s take a look at what’s available. Sprint is offering a “FREE LG Tribute 5 smartphones for the whole family” sale that started this weekend. The details of the deal are unclear on their site. They just say the phones are free for the whole family when you buy 2 or more. How are they all free if you buy 2? A Sprint rep cleared this up for me, “When you buy a plan with two or more lines, you get a free LG Tribute 5 for each line.” So if you get a family plan with 4 lines, you get 4 phones free. That’s not a bad deal for a family plan. Sprint also has a “buy one Samsung Galaxy S7 or S7 edge, get one free” deal going on (with 2 year plans, of course). AT&T is offering a $200 Visa Rewards Card with the purchase of an LG G5 or V10 smartphone with plan. They also have 50% off GoPhones with the purchase of a $45/month+ plan. Over at T-Mobile, they are offering upgrades from an iPhone 6 to an iPhone 6s for $100 and Free Samsung On5s with the purchase of a plan. Cricket Wireless is wrapping up their back-to-school sale. The sale features a free LG Spree phone with new activations. They also have Kyocera Hydro VIEWs ($29.99), ZTE Sonata 3 ($9.99), ZTE Grand Max 2 ($129.99), LG Stylo 2 ($79.99), and Nokia Lumia 650 ($69.99, or $49 online) on sale for customers transferring their number to Cricket. Walmart has several smartphones with pre-paid plans on sale. Their Straight Talk Samsung Galaxy S4 4G LTE Prepaid phone is $149. The Straight Talk Samsung Galaxy S5 4G LTE Prepaid smartphone is $299, and the refurbished Straight Talk Samsung Galaxy S4 4G Prepaid Smartphone, which includes a bonus 30 day plan, is $219. They also have a T-Mobile Samsung Galaxy S4 Prepaid Smartphone on sale for $179. Freedompop, which offers free to low cost cell phone plans that we have covered here at NFS in the past, is having a ‘double your data free’ with the purchase of these Freedompop refurbished phones: HTC Desire LTE ($29.99), Kyocera Vibe LTE ($49.99), Moto E, 2nd Gen LTE ($39.99), Samsung Galaxy S7 ($449.99). The ‘double data’ is for the first 6 months, with 4GB of data instead of 2GB for $19.99 a month. Will you be shopping for a new smartphone during Labor Day weekend?

New York City alone is home to the headquarters of more than 70 of America's 1,000 largest public companies, the most of any city in the nation. 24/7 Wall St. reviewed annual revenues to determine the largest company in every state. All but five states are home to at least one Fortune 1000 company. And the five most populated states account for more than 40% of the Fortune 1000 list. There can be large differences between the biggest company in one state and the biggest company in another -- not just in the industries they operate in but also in their size. Apple, the largest company in California, reported revenue of $233.7 billion in 2015. That is roughly 500 times the revenue of Barnard Construction Company, Montana’s largest company. Visit 24/7 Wall St. to read the complete report Unlike most big companies, however, some of America’s largest enterprises are headquartered in small cities. The largest company in the world by revenue, Wal-Mart, is based in Bentonville, Arkansas, a city of around 40,000 residents. With 2.3 million employees, Wal-Mart’s workforce is 50 times the population of its home town. Most of the largest companies are publicly traded. An initial public offering -- the first sale of stock by a private company to the public -- can have lucrative benefits. The increase in liquid capital from the IPO helps companies finance further growth and invest in new market opportunities. Because of these advantages, the largest company in all but 10 states is publicly traded. Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!
