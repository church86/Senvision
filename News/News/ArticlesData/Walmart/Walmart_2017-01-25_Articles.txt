Police say the suspect was seen cutting into packages and concealing the items in his clothing. When two CPD officers responded to the scene, the suspect turned his pistol on the officer in the garden area of the Walmart. The officer then shot at the suspect. The suspect was injured in his left arm and taken to the hospital and he is now released and in police custody. No officers were injured during the incident. The officer has been placed on administrative leave.  “We are not sure whether or not the injury to his left arm was caused from a projectile with the officer or if it was from his caused running into the things into the store while he was trying to get away,” said Police Chief Ricky Boren. “He has already been treated and released.” If the officer caused injury to the suspect from the shooting, the GBI will take over the investigation.  “It makes no sense, it’s getting outrageous, right in the daytime, it’s kids out, why must you?” said witness Kanijah Mike. “It’s ridiculous, that’s how I feel.” The suspect's name has not been released.  Just arrived on scene. Possible police officer involved shooting at Walmart on Victory Drive.

Skip to content SAT Press Releases PR Distribution Menu HOME Submit the press release Our Team & Contact Posted on January 26, 2017January 26, 2017 by Press Release Walmart Donates $50,000 To Gleaners Community Food Bank Detroit, MI (1888PressRelease) January 26, 2017 – Gleaners utilized the funds to purchase a refrigerated truck and walk-in freezer that will support the Monroe County Opportunity Program (MCOP). With the grant-funded resources, Gleaners expects to increase retail donations in Monroe County from approximately 60,000 lbs. of food per year to 200,000 lbs. per year. “We are extremely grateful to Walmart and Feeding America for making the donation of this refrigerated truck and walk-in freezer possible. These additions will provide MCOP with greater capacity for retail donations of fresh produce, frozen meat and other healthy foods throughout the year, benefitting our many hungry neighbors in Monroe County,” said Gleaners Chief Operating Officer, Julie Beamer. According to a 2015 study from Feeding America, the food insecurity rate within Monroe County is 12.8 percent with more than 19,000 food insecure individuals. MCOP is a Partner Distribution Organization (PDO) of Gleaners that serves the majority of food distribution programs in Monroe County and aims to improve access to nutrition in rural areas. Gleaners is focused on strengthening and expanding their most effective programs with a goal of increasing economic impact to households by 20 percent. “Through this wonderful donation, MCOP will be able to increase access to food for our most vulnerable residents in the community,” says MCOP Executive Director Stephanie Kasprzak. “Our work with Gleaners and Walmart continues to expand our capacity to feed more people and we are extremely grateful. Gleaners’ mission aligns directly with the Walmart Foundation’s sustainability initiatives around reducing food waste across the supply chain and diverting underutilized food into the charitable food system. Walmart’s main goal for the grant is to help Gleaners advance their retail donation program by providing assets that support growth. • Photo Album: https://goo.gl/photos/ozyrytWqrb6FMqHe9 About Gleaners Food Bank of Southeastern Michigan For 40 years, Gleaners Community Food Bank has been “feeding hungry people and nourishing our communities.” Last year, Gleaners distributed more than 38 million pounds of emergency food to over 534 partner schools, soup kitchens, shelters and pantries in Wayne, Oakland, Macomb, Livingston and Monroe counties. Of every dollar donated, Gleaners uses 94 cents for food and food programs. One dollar provides three meals for a hungry neighbor.

(AP Photo/Toby Talbot, File) (Toby Talbot / AP) Jim TurnerNews Service of Florida Should Wal-Mart and Target be allowed to sell booze? Florida lawmakers to decide Privacy Policy A measure that would allow Floridians to mix vodka and veggies in their shopping carts — something prohibited for more than eight decades — sailed through a Senate committee on Thursday. The Regulated Industries Committee, in a 9-1 vote, backed the latest proposal [SB 106] to repeal a Depression-era law requiring liquor stores and bars to be separated from groceries and other retail goods, commonly referred to as the "liquor wall." The proposal is intended by its sponsor, Miami Republican Anitere Flores, to give shoppers more convenience. The bill would allow hard spirits such as whiskey and rum to be sold alongside beer, wine and groceries in traditional supermarkets and other stores that sell groceries. The measure would also allow liquor stores to expand their grocery options. The measure could be a boon to some "big box" retailers. Meanwhile, lawmakers are looking to exclude some small gas stations and neighborhood convenience stores if the proposal becomes law. The proposal, which has failed to advance in past sessions, pits retailers Wal-Mart and Target, both in favor of the repeal, against Lakeland-based shopping giant Publix and ABC Fine Wine & Spirits.

Audrey Gibson, D-Jacksonville, said she doesn't see the proposed change causing small independent liquor stores to go out of business, as they would continue to attract "niche" customers. "It's a whole different demographic," Gibson said in voting for the proposal. "I go to [an] ABC (in Jacksonville). There is a Wal-Mart I can take the next exit to go to that has a (separate) liquor store there, but I go to that ABC because they have certain brands that I don't believe that a Wal-Mart will ever have." Sen. Keith Perry, a Gainesville Republican who cast the lone vote against the measure, said after the meeting he's open to revisions in the bill but for now has concerns about access to alcohol by minors. "I have teenage daughters, and I have a sophomore in college, and access now is pretty available, whether in bar or places," Perry said. "It's not the competitiveness that I'm concerned about. I think we should have less barriers for business." Jason Unger, a lobbyist for Target, said the change would "enable us to meet our customers' demands." Publix views stand-alone liquor stores directly adjacent to its regular stores as a business model. Scott Dick, a lobbyist for the Florida Independent Spirits Association, said the change would give the big-box operators an unfair competitive advantage over small liquor-store owners. "We operate under a level playing field today," Dick said. Charles Bailes, CEO of ABC Fine Wine & Spirits, argued big-box stores have been able to compete under the existing law and that there hasn't been a public outcry for the repeal. He also said the change would make liquor more accessible for minors to steal. Bailes noted that earlier this month an 18-year-old was arrested on multiple charges after telling a Wal-Mart manager in The Villages that she drank five cans of beer from the beer aisle. "Big box retailers have difficulty controlling what goes on in their stores, especially those that are minimally staffed," Bailes said. The bill could see some revisions in the coming weeks. Several committee members suggested greater fines for businesses repeatedly found selling liquor to minors. Also, they pointed to a need to exclude small gas stations and convenience stores that now have licenses to sell beer and wine from obtaining liquor licenses. A legal definition related to excluding certain gas stations and convenience stores from obtaining liquor licenses is already being crafted but remains a tricky issue, Flores said. "7-Eleven bad, Wawa I don't know," Flores told the committee. "I'm open to suggestions." Flores added that she'd be willing to consider adding higher fines for stores and people found repeatedly selling liquor to minors as suggested by Committee Chairman Travis Hutson, R-Elkton, and supported by some opponents of the repeal. The committee's support Thursday indicated that the proposal could have a better chance than past versions of the bill that failed to advance through the committee process in the House and Senate. The 2017 legislative session starts March 7. Rep. Bryan Avila, a Hialeah Republican who is sponsoring the House version of the bill [HB 81], said on Wednesday that consumers should be allowed to decide what they prefer. "Government's role is not to determine who wins and who loses in the market," Avila said. "I think consumers should be the one to determine whether a particular business or company is successful."

New Delhi: Retail giant Walmart sees an increase in India's domestic consumption and retail growth over a period of time on the back of social security measures proposed in the Budget. The company, which has decided to focus only on wholesale business in India owing to several restrictions in the multi-brand retail segment, also feels that the Modi government's continued focus on 'Ease of Doing Business' will help the overall industry. "Provision to provide social security measures for the middle-class and the bottom of the pyramid will help improve consumer confidence and sentiment. "Over a period of time, the middle class will be able to live in the present without the worry of the future and this should drive domestic consumption and retail growth," Walmart India President and CEO Krish Iyer said in a statement. In the Budget 2015-16, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley proposed to work towards creating universal social security system for all Indians, especially the poor. Measures proposed by the FM includes creation of senior citizen welfare fund, increase in limit in deduction of health insurance premium and an additional Rs 50,000 contribution to pension under 80CCD to be allowed. Commenting on doing business in India, Iyer said: "The government's continued focus on 'Ease of Doing Business' will help the industry tremendously. I am sure this move will also encourage State Governments to bring in similar provisions and help in driving investment-led growth." Earlier this year, Iyer had said that the government needs to work more on improving ease of doing business in the country as "the current perception is that it's not easy to do business here". Walmart had decided focus on cash and carry business and said it will open 50 wholesale stores in the next four to five years to expand its footprint in the country. Iyer also said that deferment of GAAR by two years, focus on ease of doing business and general long-term focus and expectations of double digit growth "will further renew the confidence of global investors in the country." He also termed Budget 2015-16 as 'reformist and growth oriented" and welcomed the proposed roadmap to reduction in corporate tax from 30 per cent to 25 per cent over four years as well as removal of plethora of exemptions related to taxes which was causing complexity and litigation. "Looking holistically, the Budget presented by the Finance Minister is reformist and growth oriented. The measures outlined in the budget for giving boost to the investment in infrastructure will surely benefit the economy and the retail sector in the medium to long term," he added. domestic consumption retail growth union budget 2015 Walmart Recommended For You MS Dhoni and Anil Kumble Deep in Conversation Ahead of Second T20 Sonam Kapoor Pulls Off A Denim Sari Like No One Else Bigg Boss 10: Bani, Manveer, Manu, Lopa Relive The Moments Spent Inside The House Star Tech: Watch SWAG King Raftaar's Take on Technology Hero Motocorp and The Viral Fever Salutes The Indian Army Soldiers - 'The Real Heroes' Of The Country About Us Privacy Policy Disclaimer Contact Us Sitemap Complaint Redressal Advertise With Us sections India Lifestyle States Tech Politics Auto Sports iVideos Football Power Circuit Latest News Shades Of India 2.0, Episode- 49: Priyanka Gandhi in Congress list of star campaigners for UP AI Flight Makes Emergency Landing After Passenger Suffers Heart Attack Chris Jordan Hopes to Get Picked in IPL Auction GSM-Shiv Sena Combine Assures to Ban EDMs, Rave Parties in Goa Vodafone May Join Hands With Idea Cellular Watch LIVE From Network18 News18 India CricketNext News18 States Pradesh18 Bangla News Gujarati News Urdu News Marathi News Topper Moneycontrol Firstpost CompareIndia History India MTV India In.com Burrp CNN name, logo and all associated elements ® and © 2016 Cable News Network LP, LLLP.

READ MORE READ MORE READ MORE Share Hayley Peterson (hpeterson@businessinsider.com) Jan 26th 2017 1:55PM Walmart is going after one of Costco's most lucrative businesses: car sales. The retailer is diving into the car business through a partnership with CarSaver, a website that lets customers shop for, finance, and insure vehicles, Automotive News reports. Under the partnership, CarSaver will open kiosks and information centers at Walmart stores where customers can shop for vehicles and make appointments at nearby car dealerships. If the appointments lead to a sale, CarSaver earns $350 from the transaction. To start, CarSaver is opening kiosks in 25 Walmart stores in Houston, Dallas, Phoenix, and Oklahoma City on April 1. CarSaver CEO Sean Wolfington told Automotive News that he based the Walmart program off of Costco's wildly popular car-buying service.

"I was impressed with Costco's program and how much easier it was for the dealership because consumers trusted Costco and appreciated the haggle-free pricing and hassle-free experience," he told Automotive News. He said he became "convinced that this was the right way to sell cars — with a fair, transparent price, presented by brands the customer trusts most." Costco is one of the nation's top car sellers. The company sold more than 465,000 cars last year, or about 1,000 cars per store. CarSaver is aiming to sell about 1,000 cars annually through each Walmart store. So if the program is successful and expands to more than 450 stores, it could become a major threat to Costco's service. Walmart spokeswoman Molly Blakeman says the program is still in test mode, however. CarSaver launched a pilot program last year at a Walmart store in Stuart, Florida. "We're still evaluating customer response," Blakeman told Business Insider. "It's not uncommon for us to test different customer offerings in our stores using our leased spaces." About 80% of the dealership appointments made through the Walmart store turn into sales, according to Automotive News. So what does Walmart get out of the program? The company has a landlord/tenant relationship with CarSaver like it does with others that occupy the leased space at the front of its stores, including McDonald's and Smart Clips, Blakeman said.

La Monica   @lamonicabuzz January 26, 2017: 2:12 PM ET What the U.S.-Mexico border really looks like Money transfer service MoneyGram is being bought by a financial services giant based in China. MoneyGram is one of the leading companies that helps people in the United States send money to Mexico and other countries. Ant Financial, a related company of Alibaba (BABA, Tech30), the global conglomerate backed by Chinese billionaire Jack Ma, announced Thursday it was buying MoneyGram (MGI) for $880 million. MoneyGram stock rose nearly 10% on the news. The deal could be one of the first tests of how serious President Donald Trump is about cracking down on money transfers, also known as remittances, to Mexico. Trump has already proposed building a physical wall on the border with Mexico. Trump has previously said he would consider levying big taxes -- or even halting -- remittances to Mexico if the country would not pay for the wall. On Thursday, Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto canceled a previously scheduled meeting with Trump after the rhetoric on who is going to pay for the wall ratcheted up. MoneyGram already has a thriving remittances business. And last October -- just a few weeks before the election -- MoneyGram announced a deal with Walmart (WMT) that would let customers send money from Walmart's U.S. stores to Walmart Mexico locations. So will Trump approve of MoneyGram selling out to a Chinese company? Perhaps. It's worth noting that Trump already had a meeting with Ma in New York earlier this month before the inauguration. Trump praised Ma after the meeting, saying that Ma was a "great, great entrepreneur and one of the best in the world." Trump added that "Jack and I are going to do some great things." Could the Ant deal for MoneyGram be the start of those great things? Related: Trump threatens Mexico's biggest cash source The White House was not immediately available for comment about the proposed acquisition. But executives from Ant Financial seemed to go out of their way in the press release to stress that the deal would be good for the employees of MoneyGram and consumers. The two companies stressed that MoneyGram will keep its headquarters in Dallas and that it should "maintain and grow its U.S.-based workforce." Ant Financial CEO Eric Jing said in a release that "we are committed to continuing to invest in MoneyGram's workforce and growing jobs in the United States." But Jing didn't shy away from the fact that MoneyGram is a major player in remittances from the U.S. to Mexico. He said a combined Ant Financial and MoneyGram will "will provide greater access, security and simplicity for people around the world to remit funds, especially in major economies such as the United States, China, India, Mexico and the Philippines." Related: 40% of a Mexican import is American MoneyGram CEO Alex Holmes, who will remain with the company after the acquisition, added that the deal will allow MoneyGram to expand around the world. Interestingly, Holmes predicted that consolidation in the money transfer business was coming a few years ago. He said in an interview in the Financial Times in December 2015 that "regulators want more information" and that rising compliance costs could put pressure on companies to merge. There were even rumors that MoneyGram could wind up combining with its rival Western Union. (WU) MoneyGram and Ant Financial said Wednesday that they hope their deal will close during the second half of this year. It will require regulatory approval around the globe though. Related: Jack Ma and Donald Trump met to talk jobs One of the regulators that monitors MoneyGram in the United States is the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the watchdog agency that was the brainchild of now Senator Elizabeth Warren and was created as part of the Dodd-Frank financial reform law. So it will be interesting to see whether Democrats like Warren have any issues with the proposed merger, as well as whether or not Trump gives his blessing to it. Mexico's central bank recently said that nearly $25 billion in remittances made their way into the country from friends and relatives living outside the country during the first 11 months of 2016. Nearly all of that cash was from people in the U.S. --CNNMoney's Patrick Gillespie contributed to this story.

X Corporate America divided over import tax reform plan Walmart among US firms claiming tax changes would force up consumer prices Thu, Jan 26, 2017, 18:40 Barney Jopson, Ed Crooks President Donald Trump: rift in business community threatens his pledge to overhaul the tax code by undermining a blueprint House Republicans are drafting for the White House. Photograph: Jonathan Ernst         Dozens of US exporters including GE and Boeing are squaring off against Walmart and other retailers as a radical Republican plan to tax imports divides the giants of corporate America. The rift in the business community threatens President Donald Trump’s pledge to overhaul the tax code for the first time in 30 years by undermining a blueprint that House Republicans are drafting for the White House. GE, Boeing and several dozen manufacturers are in advanced talks over forming a coalition to lobby in favour of the import tax, just as Walmart and other big importers, including the billionaire Koch brothers, mobilise against it. Walmart sent its top tax executives to meetings on Capitol Hill this week to warn officials that the proposal would have a dramatic impact on its business, potentially forcing the retailer to raise prices for shoppers, according to two congressional aides. The “border adjustment” tax regime, which would penalise imports and encourage exports, is central to the plans of House Republicans initiating tax legislation. But visceral divisions over the idea do not bode well for its prospects. US companies have spent years urging policymakers to fix a “broken” tax code only to see previous efforts fail on Capitol Hill. A post-election rally in the US stock market has been driven partly by hopes of a cut in the tax rate, but the outlook has been clouded by the import tax furore. The stakes for both sides in the battle are high. Helping exporters GE is known as one of the sharpest tax planners in US industry and Jeff Immelt, its chief executive, said of border tax adjustments in December that “things that help exporters are a good thing for GE”. GE and Boeing are among the companies negotiating the formation of a coalition to lobby for the proposal by Kevin Brady, the chief tax policymaker on Capitol Hill, according to three people familiar with the talks. ADVERTISEMENT The coalition is likely to be launched in a matter of weeks and one person said 27 businesses had already agreed to join it while dozens more had expressed an interest. The companies are in talks over hiring a political consulting firm called Cavalry to manage the campaign. The firm was founded by two former aides to Mitch McConnell, the Republican Senate majority leader, who will help decide whether the import tax survives in the Senate. More crucial to the idea’s fate will be the stance taken by Mr Trump, who has equivocated on it. Lobbyists predict that it will only prevail if he embraces border adjustments as part of his “America first” agenda – and comes up with a better slogan for the tax policy. Border adjustments would work by not letting US companies deduct the cost of foreign inputs from their revenues for tax purposes, while giving a rebate to exporters by allowing them to exclude revenue from foreign sales from their taxable income. Mr Brady, who is writing the tax plan as an ally of House speaker Paul Ryan, says the import tax would make US exporters more competitive overseas. Foreign-made goods Retailers that sell a high proportion of foreign-made goods say the import tax threatens to wipe out a large chunk of their profits. The Walmart officials visiting Capitol Hill said the company estimated conservatively that it would have to raise the prices consumers pay for clothing and electronics by 20 per cent, said one congressional aide. Scot Ciccarelli, analyst at RBC Capital Markets, divided retailers into four groups according to the impact of border adjustment and placed Walmart among those likely to suffer the most, alongside Best Buy and Williams Sonoma. They would experience “sizeable drops in net income and more limited ability to pass through price increases, materially raising future earnings risk”, he wrote this month, citing the price sensitivity of Walmart shoppers as a barrier to asking them to pick up the cost. With 98 per cent of clothes sold in the US made overseas, the National Retail Federation, a trade group, says the import tax could inflate the tax bills of some fashion chains to three to five times their pre-tax profits, jeopardising their solvency. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2017       Topics: Donald Trump Doug Holtz Eakin Jeff Immelt Kevin Brady Mitch Mcconnell Paul Ryan Scot Ciccarelli Best Buy Boeing Cavalry Ge WalMart Williams-Sonoma Read More John FitzGerald: Expanding capacity of building sector takes time Mixed signals for Dublin’s economy as consumer morale dips Exporters urged to exploit Asian market after Brexit Consumers drive Britain’s economy, repulsing Brexit hit Central Bank downgrades growth forecast amid Brexit fears Planet Business: alternative facts and a dash of Musk How much did Airbnb hosts in Dublin earn last year?

News Opinion Entertainment Taiwan Living Learn English E-Newsletter International Edition Saturday January, 28, 2017 About Us Subscribe Advertise Contact Us Business Company Focus Africa Middle East Europe Americas Asia Global Markets CEO Talks Judge rejects US$80 million penalty in Wal-Mart truck drivers By Sudhin Thanawala, AP  January 27, 2017, 12:06 am TWN SHARE CLOSE Blogger   Google+ Live Journal   Plurk Stumble Upon     Tweet A- A+ SAN FRANCISCO -- A federal judge on Wednesday refused to force Wal-Mart to pay US$80 million in penalties in a lawsuit alleging the retail giant failed to pay hundreds of truck drivers in California the minimum wage for certain tasks. Wal-Mart acted in good faith when paying the drivers and had reason to believe its payment policy aligned with California law, according to U.S. District Judge Susan Illston in San Francisco. A jury awarded the workers more than US$54 million in back wages in November after finding that Wal-Mart didn't pay the drivers the state's base wage for inspecting their vehicles before and after trips and for taking 10-hour layovers and 10-minute rest breaks. Attorneys for the drivers had asked Illston to award an additional US$80 million in penalties and damages. An email to their lawyer was not immediately returned Wednesday. "While we still disagree with the jury's verdict on the case, we're pleased the judge declined to award any additional penalties," said Randy Hargrove, a Wal-Mart spokesman. Arkansas-based Wal-Mart Stores Inc. said its drivers earn among the highest salaries in the field and that the plaintiffs were "overreaching." The company has said its drivers earn from about US$80,000 to more than US$100,000 a year. Illston largely agreed with Wal-Mart, citing testimony that she said showed Wal-Mart's compensation was among the highest in the trucking industry. Attorneys for Wal-Mart also had said in a court filing that "reasonable minds could differ" about the legality of its pay and layover policies. The judge said Wal-Mart's payment policy developed in an "uncertain" legal landscape, giving the company reasonable grounds to believe it was complying with California minimum wage law. Illston did award the drivers nearly US$6 million in restitution for an additional year that they say Wal-Mart violated minimum wage law but was not covered by the jury's verdict. Wal-Mart drivers are not paid by the hour. Wages are based on mileage and specified activities. The company argued during trial that it paid drivers for activities that included smaller tasks and could not have a separate payment designation for everything they did, some of which took just minutes. Wal-Mart pays drivers US$42 for 10-hour overnight layovers as an extra benefit, but it does not control their time during that period, Scott Edelman, an attorney for the company, said during trial. Drivers are free to go to the movies, exercise or do other activities, he said.

Head to your local Walmart by: Crystal Bonvillian, Cox Media Group National Content Desk Updated: Jan 26, 2017 - 9:37 AM Clayton Fackler, 72, works at the checkout at the Walmart Supercenter in Bowling Green, Ohio, in May 2006. J.D. Pooley/Getty Images Twtter Walmart customers can add a new car to their shopping lists in April, when the retail giant will begin selling autos at select locations. The move into auto sales will be accomplished through a partnership between Walmart and CarSaver, an online auto retail platform. According to Automotive News, CarSaver will launch the program April 1 at 25 Walmart Supercenters in Houston, Dallas, Phoenix and Oklahoma City. “It is not uncommon for us to test different customer offerings in our stores using our leased spaces,” Walmart spokeswoman Molly Blakeman said. “We currently have a one-store pilot underway with CarSaver in Stuart, Florida, and are still evaluating customer response.” Consumerist reported that 80 percent of the appointments set up at dealerships by Florida Walmart customers resulted in a sale. >> Read more trending stories CarSaver’s online platform allows car buyers to search for the car they want, finance it and insure the vehicle through its website or a touch-screen kiosk, Automotive News reported. As part of the plan for Walmart, Carsaver is partnering with a variety of dealership groups, including AutoNation Inc., the largest retailer of new vehicles in the U.S. Ally Financial will be the preferred lender for the program. CarSaver staff will be set up at CarSaver Centers established inside the Walmart Supercenters, where they can explain the program to customers and offer other assistance. Once customers have chosen their vehicles and applied for financing and insurance, they will be put in contact with a local certified dealership. All dealerships in the program are within 15 miles of the Walmart stores from which buyers can shop, Automotive News said. CarSaver CEO Sean Wolfington said the program is modeled after Costco’s auto sales program, which he managed for a dealership at which he worked more than 20 years ago. “I was impressed with Costco’s program and how much easier it was for the dealership because consumers trusted Costco and appreciated the haggle-free pricing and hassle-free experience,” Wolfington said. Fortune reported last year that Costco has become one of the nation’s top auto sellers. In 2015, the warehouse chain sold more than 465,000 vehicles. Sam’s Club launched its own program later that year, Consumerist reported.  Amazon, which recently struck deals with auto parts suppliers to sell parts directly through its website, has also been selling autos online in Italy since last November, Business Insider reported. It could potentially launch a similar initiative in the U.S.    © 2017 Cox Media Group. Twtter Need a new car?

 Walmart is going after one of Costco's most lucrative businesses Hayley Peterson Jan. 26, 2017, 12:34 PM 12,146 facebook linkedin twitter email print Walmart is getting into the car business. AP Walmart is going after one of Costco's most lucrative businesses: car sales. The retailer is diving into the car business through a partnership with CarSaver, a website that lets customers shop for, finance, and insure vehicles, Automotive News reports. Under the partnership, CarSaver will open kiosks and information centers at Walmart stores where customers can shop for vehicles and make appointments at nearby car dealerships. If an appointment leads to a sale, CarSaver earns $350 from the transaction. To start, CarSaver is opening kiosks in 25 Walmart stores in Houston, Dallas, Phoenix, and Oklahoma City on April 1. CarSaver CEO Sean Wolfington told Automotive News that he based the Walmart program on Costco's popular car-buying service. He said that more than two decades ago, he managed the Costco program for a dealership he worked at. "I was impressed with Costco's program and how much easier it was for the dealership because consumers trusted Costco and appreciated the haggle-free pricing and hassle-free experience," he told Automotive News. He said he was "convinced that this was the right way to sell cars — with a fair, transparent price, presented by brands the customer trusts most." Shelves with merchandise at a Walmart distribution center in Bentonville, Arkansas. REUTERS/Rick Wilking Costco is one of the nation's top car-sellers. The company sold more than 465,000 cars in 2015, or about 1,000 cars per store. CarSaver is aiming to sell about 1,000 cars annually through each Walmart store. So if the program is successful and expands to more than 450 stores, it could become a major threat to Costco's service. Walmart spokeswoman Molly Blakeman says the program is still in test mode, however. CarSaver launched a pilot program last year at a Walmart store in Stuart, Florida. "We're still evaluating customer response," Blakeman told Business Insider. "It's not uncommon for us to test different customer offerings in our stores using our leased spaces." More than half of the dealership appointments made through the Walmart store turned into sales, according to Automotive News. So what does Walmart get out of the program? The company has a landlord/tenant relationship with CarSaver like it does with other companies that occupy the leased spaces at the front of its stores, including McDonald's and Smart Clips, Blakeman said.

Corner Bench Memos Bench Magazine Subscribe Login Donate An Education Leader with One Big Idea DeVos testifies at her confirmation hearing, January 17, 2017. (Reuters photo: Yuri Gripas) Share article on Facebookshare Tweet articletweet Plus one article on Google Plus+1 Print Article Adjust font size AA AA AA AA AA AA AA by Dan Currell January 26, 2017 4:00 AM Betsy DeVos is the focused campaigner American schools need. Big institutions aren’t easy to change, and American public education is big: Over 3 million teachers were employed in American public schools in 2016. Walmart, the world’s largest employer, has 1.4 million U.S. employees; the American military has 1.3 million people on active duty. Since American public education needs to change, as everyone seems to agree, what would it take to turn around an institution that’s bigger than Walmart and the U.S. military combined? A technocrat who knows many things will never turn around a massive organization. Subtlety and complexity are quickly lost in a sea of 3 million people. The focused leader who knows one big thing at least stands a chance of turning around even the largest organization: One big message, driven home relentlessly, can get through. Betsy DeVos’s one big idea is school choice, and that big idea brings a secondary effect, which is institutional competition. While her big idea is not guaranteed to fix America’s failing public schools, at least it has a chance — and that’s more than can be said for everything else that has been tried. Indeed, DeVos would be worse off if she had the kind of extensive in-school experience that liberals so angrily attack her for lacking. If she had been a teacher, administrator, and political campaigner, she would be the fox that knows many things. Thankfully, she’s not. Instead she has stuck with one big idea over a long philanthropic career: school choice. She’s the hedgehog that knows one big thing. And this hedgehog is about to wander into a very complicated situation. The United States has the best public schools in the world. The top public high schools send nearly all their graduates on to college, and many to the most selective colleges. Faculty and parents are dedicated to the educational task, and most students graduate with college credit already in hand. The quality of these schools supports high housing prices within the district, generating property-tax revenues to fund the schools. Even a whiff of weak school performance will draw the ire not only of parents but of every homeowner with something to lose. It’s a positive feedback loop. We also have the worst public schools in the developed world. In 1,200 American high schools, a third or more of the students don’t graduate. In 2013, 66 percent of U.S. fourth graders and 64 percent of eighth graders could not read at their grade level, according to the National Assessment of Education Progress (NAEP) reading test. In 2013 the United States spent more per student than all OECD countries except Austria, Luxembourg, Norway, and Switzerland — yet our educational outcomes have hovered around 20th place among OECD’s 34 (now 35) nations. Our worst high schools are essentially prisons with poor security and lots of overhead. Parents see all of this, and most would rather not be trapped in a bad system. According to a 2013 Luntz Global Public Opinion Survey, 64 percent of American parents said they would send their children to a different school if they could. What that means in practice is that most American parents want — and lack — the option to enroll their child in a better charter, magnet, or private school than the public school they now attend. Into this complex picture walks Betsy DeVos, a relentless school-choice advocate. The daughter of a public-school teacher, she has never taught professionally and never attended public schools. Her philanthropic career has never strayed from the issue of school choice. She has campaigned in her home state and across the country to give lower-income families the chance to choose the right schools for their children. Can her big idea fix American public education? She has campaigned in her home state and across the country to give lower-income families the chance to choose the right schools for their children. Consumer choice has been a basic tenet of American law since at least 1890. At that time, the field of economics was still evolving, but competition was one of its tenets as well, and it would turn out to be its most enduring. Competitive markets were known to improve products, prevent corruption, encourage adequate supply, and keep prices moderate. And competition happens only when consumers have a meaningful choice between different products or services. This point was enshrined in the Sherman Anti-Trust Act of 1890, a statute that remains a cornerstone of American commercial law. Theodore Roosevelt and his successor as president, William Howard Taft, were the original trust-busters, doggedly prosecuting over 100 companies under the Sherman Act in what seemed at the time an uphill battle against large, entrenched interests. Today such high-profile prosecutions are less frequent and arguably less necessary because our society is so committed to the basic principle of consumer choice. But consumer choice suddenly becomes controversial — and somehow emotional — when it comes to public schools. The local monopoly of the public school went unquestioned until Milton Friedman suggested a free-market voucher system in 1962. His idea didn’t take root right away, but in 1991 some left-leaning reformers in Minnesota passed a charter-school law, creating for the first time the possibility of school choice. Now 43 states and the District of Columbia have passed charter-school laws and 17 states have some form of voucher system. Still, change is hard. Powerful institutional forces keep millions of American students in poorly performing public schools with no meaningful alternatives. As Betsy DeVos said in her confirmation hearing, “The human tendency is to guard what is because change is difficult.” She appears to know, after a few decades dedicated to this issue, that most failing schools won’t improve on their own, because teachers, administrators and even parents fear change. To change, the worst schools need exposure to a force more powerful than their own incentives and inertia. DeVos knows that competition is a force powerful enough to change a sector as big and change-resistant as American education. Perhaps nothing else is. The best evidence that competition might actually be powerful enough to work is the unearthly shrieking now emanating from those who fear change the most: teachers’ unions. Their shrieking is probably justified. Competition always brings on change, and change within large institutions hurts like hell. Michigan, DeVos’s home state, is familiar with that kind of pain. By the 1980s it was clear that Detroit’s signal industry was ceding ground to foreign competition — Toyota in particular. It would have been sensible for a company like General Motors to seek out Toyota’s recipe for success and start to replicate it. W. Edwards Deming, an American well known in Detroit, was the inspiration for Toyota’s quality revolution. In fact, Toyota shared Deming’s playbook with General Motors through a joint venture begun in California in 1984. Deming’s approach was initially rejected by GM, Ford, and Chrysler because it involved massive change, and change hurts. But competition is powerful enough to change even the biggest institutions, given enough time to do its work. Toyota didn’t just give us great Toyotas; it eventually gave us better Fords. Competition is powerful enough to change even the biggest institutions. American education in 2017 looks a lot like American cars did in 1987. Average quality is low by international standards. The largest school districts (e.g., Chicago) fear competition the most because, like the Big Three, they know how much pain it will bring. For unions and management alike, the great enemy is not one another; it’s the spectre of competition. Which is why school choice is the only remaining hope for parents and children caught in America’s failing schools. The Bush administration’s effort to achieve higher public-school performance through the No Child Left Behind Act was finally abandoned in late 2015 after broadly failing to achieve its goals. As reported this week, the Obama administration’s effort to improve America’s worst high schools with $7 billion in federal cash has been judged by the Department of Education itself to have had no effect. School choice has the power to be different. It may be that some of the worst schools can’t be fixed. For some children, school choice will mean a chance to attend a private or charter school that performs better — or is just a better fit for their needs. For others, the competition brought on by school choice will mean that their local public school will begin to make some painful changes, the way GM, Ford, and Chrysler all eventually did. Either path is far better than the status quo. Mrs. DeVos’s confirmation hearing saw Democratic senators concede that charter schools could be acceptable as long as they had no effect on public schools. (Senator Murray asked DeVos to commit that she would “not cut a penny” from public schools.) But having an effect on public schools is half the point of school choice. We don’t just want to be able to buy Toyotas. We want the fact that we could buy a Toyota to make our Chevrolets better. Betsy DeVos will continue to be characterized by her critics as an opponent of public schools. She is no more against American public schools than W. Edwards Deming was against American cars or Theodore Roosevelt was against American railroads. In all three cases, the success of the whole sector required a hedgehog with one big idea: competition. For American schools, Betsy DeVos is that hedgehog, and in 2017 her time has come. — Dan Currell is a legal consultant who serves on several nonprofit educational boards.

MoneyGram is one of the leading companies that helps people in the United States send money to Mexico and other countries. By Paul R. La Monica NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Money transfer service MoneyGram is being bought by a financial services giant based in China. MoneyGram is one of the leading companies that helps people in the United States send money to Mexico and other countries. Ant Financial, an affiliate of Alibaba, the global conglomerate backed by Chinese billionaire Jack Ma, announced Thursday it was buying MoneyGram for $880 million. MoneyGram stock rose nearly 10% on the news. The deal could be one of the first tests of how serious President Donald Trump is about cracking down on money transfers, also known as remittances, to Mexico. Trump has already proposed building a physical wall on the border with Mexico. Trump has previously said he would consider levying big taxes -- or even halting -- remittances to Mexico if the country would not pay for the wall. On Thursday, Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto canceled a previously scheduled meeting with Trump after the rhetoric on who is going to pay for the wall ratcheted up. MoneyGram already has a thriving remittances business. And last October -- just a few weeks before the election -- MoneyGram announced a deal with Walmart that would let customers send money from Walmart's U.S. stores to Walmart Mexico locations. So will Trump approve of MoneyGram selling out to a Chinese company? Perhaps. It's worth noting that Trump already had a meeting with Ma in New York earlier this month before the inauguration. Trump praised Ma after the meeting, saying that Ma was a "great, great entrepreneur and one of the best in the world." Trump added that "Jack and I are going to do some great things." Could the Ant deal for MoneyGram be the start of those great things? The White House was not immediately available for comment about the proposed acquisition. But executives from Ant Financial seemed to go out of their way in the press release to stress that the deal would be good for the employees of MoneyGram and consumers. The two companies stressed that MoneyGram will keep its headquartered in Dallas and that it should "maintain and grow its U.S.-based workforce." Ant Financial CEO Eric Jing said in a release that "we are committed to continuing to invest in MoneyGram's workforce and growing jobs in the United States." But Jing didn't shy away from the fact that MoneyGram is a major player in remittances from the U.S. to Mexico. He said a combined Ant Financial and MoneyGram will "will provide greater access, security and simplicity for people around the world to remit funds, especially in major economies such as the United States, China, India, Mexico and the Philippines." MoneyGram CEO Alex Holmes, who will remain with the company after the acquisition, added that the deal will allow MoneyGram to expand around the world. Interestingly, Holmes predicted that consolidation in the money transfer business was coming a few years ago. He said in an interview in the Financial Times in December 2015 that "regulators want more information" and that rising compliance costs could put pressure on companies to merge. There were even rumors that MoneyGram could wind up combining with its rival Western Union. MoneyGram and Ant Financial said Wednesday that they hope their deal will close during the second half of this year. It will require regulatory approval around the globe though. One of the regulators that monitors MoneyGram in the United States is the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the consumer watchdog agency created as part of the Dodd-Frank financial reform law that was the brainchild of now Senator Elizabeth Warren. So it will be interesting to see whether Democrats like Warren have any issues with the proposed merger, as well as whether or not Trump gives his blessing to it. Mexico's central bank recently said that nearly $25 billion in remittances made their way into the country from friends and relatives living outside the country during the first 11 months of 2016. Nearly all of that cash was from people in the U.S. --CNNMoney's Patrick Gillespie contributed to this story. TM & © 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Most Popular Walmart is going Hollywood, tapping star directors to create three 60-second ads to air on the Academy Awards on ABC Feb. 26 in the giant retailer's first appearance there. Walmart has challenged directors Antoine Fuqua, Marc Forster and filmmaking partners Seth Rogen & Evan Goldberg to make the 60-second "short films," based not on a play or a book, but a Walmart receipt. The six items on the receipt are bananas, paper towels, batteries, scooter, wrapping paper and video baby monitor. The Hollywood Reporter originally reported the deal with the filmmakers earlier today. "Agency partners were definitely involved, both on the [Saatchi & Saatchi] and [Publicis Groupe] side," said spokeswoman Meggan Kring. Plans were in the works before Haworth was officially named Walmart's U.S. media agency earlier this month, she said. The effort is a move by Walmart to get a place in popular culture on par with its retail footprint. "Being a part of the Academy Awards is a great way to connect with our customers in a fresh, new way," said Walmart U.S. Chief Marketing Officer Tony Rogers in a statement. "As the world's largest brand, and a company that sells just about everything, we plan to be more involved, more engrained in the cultural moments that our customers care about, starting with the Oscars." Every receipt tells a story "as diverse as the customer who shops us," Mr. Rogers said. "We think of our business beyond simple transactions." He described the campaign an "unexpected way of telling our brand story" and "a perfect fit for a night where compelling storytelling is celebrated." Walmart is teasing the campaign on its website at Walmart.com/thereceipt. Often called the "Super Bowl for Women," the Academy Awards are likely well over the cost of a single Super Bowl spot for Walmart. Kohl's, last year's exclusive sponsor with five spots and a total of three minutes on the broadcast, spent an estimated $9 million on media, according to iSpot.tv. Historically the broadcast has had an exclusive retail sponsor, with JC Penney having held that position for 14 years prior to Kohl's appearance last year. But Ms. Kring couldn't immediately confirm if Walmart has a category exclusive. This is the first of multiyear sponsorship of the Oscars, Walmart said, though it didn't disclose the length of the commitment or spending. But the effort also includes a $250,000 donation to The Academy Grants Program for FilmCraft in the name of the participating directors. The donation "demonstrates Walmart's continual commitment to diversity in filmmaking," the company said. Even prior to this, Walmart sponsored an annual Bentonville Film Festival in partnership with Geena Davis, among others, aimed at encouraging diversity in casting, direction, writing and production of films. The third year of the festival is set for May. Michael Francis, who has considerable Hollywood ties as former Dreamworks chief marketing officer, is now a Walmart marketing consultant and was part of the team involved in putting the deal together, Ms. Kring said. But the retailer always has had deep ties to the entertainment industry by virtue of selling so many DVDs and CDs, licensed goods, and streaming video via Vudu. Among other things, that's given Walmart leverage to draw an endless stream of stars to its annual shareholder meeting in Arkansas each year, but now its putting Hollywood to work entertaining customers in ads, too. "This was a wonderful challenge from Walmart," said Mr. Fuqua in a statement. The director known for the Academy Award-winning film "Training Day" and other action thrillers said the Walmart work lets him "tell an extraordinary story shaped around six ordinary objects." Mr. Forster, director of "Monster's Ball" and "Kite Runner," said, "The uniqueness of this challenge from Walmart allowed me to exercise my passion for storytelling in a very exciting way by crafting a story that revolves around people's everyday needs, wants and desires."

Xi Jinping calls on the official union to. "[R]epression no longer works as in the past." The director of the China Labour Bulletin analyses the situation. Hong Kong (AsiaNews) – Tensions are rising between workers and employers in China, a trend accentuated by the global economic crisis and greater awareness by workers of their rights, this according to Han Dongfang, China’s first free trade union leader. A leading figure in 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, Han spent 22 months in prison until his release for health reasons in 1991. After spending a year in the United States for medical treatment, he returned home in 1993 only to be expelled to Hong Kong where in 1994 he founded the China Labour Bulletin, an NGO that fights for the rights of Chinese workers. (Courtesy of the China Labour Bulletin). Multinational companies with interests in China are facing a challenge: labour unrest. While academics debate whether there is or isn’t a labour movement in China, human resource managers and CEOs on the ground are facing the reality of an angry workforce aware of its rights and conscious of its interests. Take Wal-Mart for example. Since 2014, Wal-Mart ‘associates’ – workers to the rest of us – have built social media platforms through which workers share information and support resistance to the corporation’s introduction of flexible working hours. The ‘comprehensive working hours system’ does not just reduce overtime pay. It makes it hard for workers to plan family life or take the second jobs often required to meet basic living costs. In early July this year, strikes broke out across four stores. Blogs posted by workers and read by tens of thousands of Wal-Mart employees tell of store managers using the new work roster to target activists, especially those who refuse to sign up to the new system. The arrogance and at times bullying behaviour displayed by store managers belies Wal-Mart’s service values such as ‘Act with Integrity’ and ‘Respect for the Individual’. In the southern province of Guangdong, Chinese workers are furious at factory sell-offs with the potential to impinge negatively on pension rights and seniority. In November, workers at a Danone water-bottling plant organized a week-long strike after learning that the factory had been sold off without anyone informing them. They demanded proper severance arrangements be put in place for those wishing to leave due to uncertainties over pension rights and social insurance arrears. In the same month, Sony ran into similar problems following the sale of its camera plant in Guangzhou that came as a total shock to its 4,000 plus workers. On 10 November, workers organised a strike and picket lines that brought the plant’s assembly lines to a halt and blocked goods from coming in and out of the plant just as the Christmas busy season was getting into gear. Perhaps for this reason, there were indications that Sony has met most of the workers’ demands – but were reportedly going after strike organizers. Of course, multinational companies acquire and sell factories all the time. That’s how capitalism works. However, in China deals are signed off without their employees finding out until months later. As these highly organised, coordinated and social-media connected strikes suggest, we are entering a new era in which workers are demanding a place at the negotiating table. At present there is no effective channel through which workers can negotiate their share of the pie with employers. In its absence, local governments deploy riot police and make arrests, repressing strikes but failing to address the cause. It is a violent and expensive response and it doesn’t work: strikes continue to be a regular feature of China’s labour relations. As we have argued at China Labour Bulletin, there is an effective alternative for workers, employers and the state to the strikes and protests: collective bargaining. Why? First, repression no longer works as in the past. It was certainly effective in the early days of unregulated capitalism when China opened up its coastal zones to foreign investment in 1980s. It worked too during the privatisation of large numbers of state-owned enterprises in the late nineties when up to 35 million workers lost their jobs. But it won’t work today. Workers know their rights and know what is due to them. Second, millions of China’s workers are now able to spread information via social media bypassing the state’s firewalls and official media channels. The information genie is out of the bottle giving workers access to knowledge hitherto denied them. And as the old cliché goes, knowledge is power. Information reduces isolation and the fear that comes with it. Workers can see that they are not alone and there are others facing similar struggles whether it be over flexible working hours, secret sell-offs or wage arrears. Information also increases leverage. Workers in the Danone strike had access to data on a previous dispute over a sell-off by Pepsi-Cola in which workers’ demands were mostly met. Third, and most important with regard to collective bargaining, is the issue of workers’ representation. In China there is only one legal trade union, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU) led by the Chinese Communist Party and controlled by employers in most workplaces. Although there are rare occasions when it has acted on behalf of workers, this is almost always under pressure from strikes and protests. Indeed, Chinese workers are like workers anywhere. They need to have the opportunity to elect representatives and present their grievances to management via a legally-defined process of negotiation otherwise known as collective bargaining. The inability of the ACFTU to carry out this core trade union task means that workers have no option but to go on strike, taking us back to repression.   The pressure on the ACFTU is not just coming from workers. In 2015, China’s ‘core leader’ Xi Jinping ordered the ACFTU to come up with a plan to improve workplace representation. Xi’s anti-corruption drive won him considerable support among China’s workers. But he cannot afford to sacrifice it, particularly in the run-up to this year’s 19th Party Congress where the legitimacy of his leadership and of the Party’s rule will be subject to domestic and international scrutiny. Thus his instruction to the union to up its game and ensure workers needs are met is aimed at shoring up legitimacy. To date, no plan has been forthcoming – at least not in public. But the longer the ACFTU procrastinates, the higher the stakes for everyone, including the multinationals and their supply chains. Labour unrest in China is not going to go away. Beginning 21 November, striking Coca-Cola workers in three cities thousands of miles apart – Chengdu, Chongqing and Jilin – called for effective trade union involvement in talks with management over plant sell-offs. Their demands have clearly been coordinated and the dispute escalated amid reports of police violence in Chongqing. Faced with this pressure from below, it is my firm conviction that the question is no longer if the Party will introduce some form of collective bargaining, but when. It will do so in order to ensure its own survival and my advice to domestic and international employers alike is to be ready for it.  e-mail this to a friend Printable version TAGs china labour unrest china labour bulletin workers strikes trade union han dongfang e-mail this to a friend :Han Dongfang: Dismissals, arrests, and jail do not stop Chinese workers China Labour unrest is growing in China.

They want better salaries and a higher end-of-year bonus. Worker rights advocate Han Dongfang says, “After 30 years of reform and spectacular economic growth, the cracks are beginning to show”; workers deserve “better standard of living, better working conditions and a better future”. 05/03/2007 CHINA Democratic unions against European and US exploitation of industry workers The noted Chinese union leader Han Dongfang speaks out against the exploitation of workers by foreign companies. Public authorities rarely intervene. Independent workers organisations are needed to evaluate rising popular dissent. Migrant’s situation particularly precarious. 04/06/2007 CHINA Tiananmen massacre still continues today Eighteen years since the repression of the anti-corruption and pro-democracy movement, Han Dongfang, founder of the first free Chinese trade union, looks at the current situation of human and civil rights in his country and warns that continued repression and terror against the people can only undermine society as a whole. 21/07/2007 CHINA Slave labour “normal” in today’s China, says Han Dongfang The founder of China’s first independent trade union talks about the brick kiln slave scandal. Slave labour is symptomatic of society in which those in power distort the common good for personal gain and hide their misdeeds. Deng Xiaoping’s black and white cat analogy has led to a society where the powerless get crushed. 10/05/2006 CHINA Human rights in China threatened by local governments' violence Exploitative working conditions and human rights abuses are feeding social unrest in China. Local authorities are resorting to gangs of thugs to beat up protesters. This phenomenon runs counter to statements coming from Beijing about the need for harmonious development; it is worrisome because it is opening the door to total illegality when it comes to human rights.

Police say a group of young men met in the McDonald’s inside the Walmart to discuss the sale of a cell phone, but at some point, the meeting turned violent and shots were fired. Rafael Semmler was at the store with his family when the gunfire erupted and said everyone was screaming and running to get away. Semmler, a military veteran who served as a medic in Kuwait, Iraq, and Bosnia, made sure his family was safe, then ran straight to the area where the gunshots originated. “You don’t really think about it, it’s just at that time it’s kind of like instinct, it’s what you’ve been trained to do,” Semmler said, “And was my first instinct was to go toward it to see if there’s anything I could do to help out.” Semmler found the injured man with a gunshot to his arm. He was bleeding profusely and said he was dying. So Semmler grabbed shirts and whatever else he could use to apply pressure to the wounds. “He just kept telling me, ‘Please don’t leave, just stay with me. Stay here,’ and I told him I’d stay there, so I did,” Semmler said. The other two men involved in the incident took off and the injured man is expected to survive. Semmler, who never even got the man’s name, said he was just glad he was in the right place at the right time.

CHINA-APPLE-QUALCOMM Apple sues Qualcomm in China over technology fees BEIJING (AP) — Apple Inc. has filed suit in China challenging chipmaker Qualcomm Inc.’s fees for technology used in smartphones. A Beijing court says two suits filed by the iPhone maker accuse Qualcomm of abusing its control over essential technology to charge excessive licensing fees. Most of Apple’s iPhones are assembled in China by contractors. Qualcomm said in a statement it had not seen Apple’s complaint but defended its fees. The company said Apple was offered terms consistent with those accepted by more than 100 Chinese manufacturers. Qualcomm agreed to change its licensing practices after Chinese regulators fined the company 6 billion yuan ($975 million) in 2015 on charges it abused its control over technology to charge excessive fees. WAL-MART TRUCKERS-WAGE DISPUTE Judge rejects $80M penalty in Wal-Mart truck drivers lawsuit SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — A federal judge in San Francisco won’t force Wal-Mart to pay $80 million in penalties in a lawsuit alleging the retail giant failed to pay hundreds of California truck drivers minimum wage for certain tasks. U.S. District Judge Susan Illston ruled Wednesday that Wal-Mart acted in good faith and reasonably believed its payment policy met California law. An email to an attorney for the drivers wasn’t immediately returned. A jury in November found Wal-Mart failed to pay the drivers minimum wage for inspecting their vehicles before and after trips and for taking 10-hour layovers and 10-minute rest breaks. Jurors awarded the workers more than $54 million in back wages. The drivers requested additional damages and penalties. The company had argued that it paid drivers for activities that included smaller tasks. FACEBOOK-TRENDING TOPICS Facebook tweaks ‘trending’ feature to root out fake news NEW YORK (AP) — Facebook is updating its “trending” feature, which shows popular topics discussed and shared on its site, in an effort to root out fake news and misinformation. The social media giant says it will now look at the number of publishers posting about the same topic — not just the number of people sharing or commenting on single posts or articles — when assembling its list. That’s intended to ensure that the topics “reflect real world events being covered by multiple outlets.” Facebook will also stop personalizing the topics based on users’ interests. After criticism of the way it has allowed misinformation to spread on its site in the months leading up to the election, Facebook in December announced a slew of new measures to curb the spread of fake news. BORING MUSK Elon Musk tweets mystery tunnel boring project LOS ANGELES (AP) — Elon Musk’s already going high, and now he says he’s going low. In mid-December the billionaire tweeted “Traffic is driving me nuts” and “am going to build a tunnel boring machine and just start digging.” On Wednesday, the SpaceX and Tesla founder tweeted he plans to begin in a month or so at his Los Angeles-area rocket factory. The statements have launched speculation about another fantastic transportation idea from Musk, who is known for advocating a “hyperloop” — a futuristic system of vacuum tubes with passenger-carrying capsules. But Musk’s cryptic tweets leave unclear what kind of tunnel he’ll be digging. One tweet said the starting point will be across from his desk at SpaceX in Hawthorne, California, but didn’t say how big the tunnel will be or where it will lead to. BOOKS-ROXANE GAY Gay parts with publisher over deal with far-right pundit NEW YORK (AP) — Angered with her publisher for giving a platform to the “blunt, inelegant hate” of far-right commentator Milo Yiannopoulos, author Roxane Gay has withdrawn a planned book with Simon & Schuster. Gay confirmed to The Associated Press on Wednesday that she will not be releasing “How to Be Heard” through Simon & Schuster, which had scheduled the book for 2018. In comments provided to BuzzFeed News, Gay says Yiannopolous, whose book “Dangerous” comes out in March, had every right to express his views. But she says a deal with a major publisher is not a right, but a privilege. Gay decided she did not want to be in “business with a publisher willing to grant him that privilege.” Simon & Schuster did not immediately respond to requests for comment. BACKPAGE-SEX TRAFFICKING Website that advertised escort services sued in 4 states SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — New lawsuits have been filed in four states on behalf of women who say they were victimized as teenagers when they were sold for sex on an international website. Attorneys say the suits filed Wednesday in Alabama, California, Texas and Washington are the first to individually name the operators of Backpage.com. CEO Carl Ferrer and purported owners Michael Lacey and James Larkin are among those sued, along with other affiliated individuals and holding companies. The complaints say the three men are liable because they knew they were profiting from illegal sex trafficking. The men appeared in a California courtroom on Tuesday to contest similar criminal charges that they say are barred by federal law and free speech protections. Backpage’s general counsel, Liz McDougall, declined comment on the lawsuits. CHINA-NORTH KOREA China releases new list of items banned for export to NKorea BEIJING (AP) — China has released a new list of items banned for export to North Korea, following a new round of United Nations sanctions and complaints from President Donald Trump that Beijing was doing too little to pressure its communist neighbor. A statement from the Commerce Ministry said the items included dual-use technologies that could aid the North’s programs to develop nuclear, chemical and biological weapons as well as the missiles to deliver them. While largely comprising specialty chemicals and rare alloys, the list also included computer software, machinery, high-speed cameras, aircraft engines and six-axle truck chassis. China is the North’s largest source of trade and aid, but is frustrated by Pyongyang’s defiance of the U.N. Trump complained in a tweet earlier this month that China “won’t help with North Korea.” PHILIPPINES-ECONOMY Philippines GDP grows 6.6 pct in Oct-Dec, 6.8 pct for year MANILA, Philippines (AP) — Officials report the Philippine economy expanded at a 6.6 percent annual rate in October-December, the slowest pace of expansion for the year, though full-year annual growth clocked in at a relatively brisk 6.8 percent. Economic Planning Secretary Ernesto Pernia said Thursday that robust domestic demand helped offset a contraction in agriculture, slowing government spending and wariness over President Rodrigo Duterte’s administration. The 6.8 percent expansion for the year was at the high end of the government’s target of 6.0 to 7.0 percent growth. Growth in the past seven years has averaged 6.3 percent. Brash-talking Duterte inherited a relatively vibrant economy when he took office in May. He has pledged to slash the poverty rate, but investors are wary of his swashbuckling approach to governing.

The first advantage is its customer base. Target's shoppers are younger on average than those of Kohl's or Walmart. The second advantage is its Cartwheel App, which already has some 30 million users. "If Target can build a payment system that makes redeeming offers and checkout easier, there's a good chance it will get serious adoption rates," said eMarketer analyst Yory Wurmser. The timing of the rollout was reported by Recode earlier this week. (Reports that Target was working on a payment system had been circulating for more than a year.) Target's chief information and digital officer Michael McNamara told Recode that the company plans to introduce mobile payment features to one or more of its apps, though the service will at first only be offered to shoppers with a Target REDcard. Target's focus on millennials gives it a strong base from which to develop mobile payment use. Millennials have been the quickest of any generation to adopt mobile payments. eMarketer estimates that more than a third of millennial smartphone users will use mobile payments this year. These millennial mobile payment users will account for more than half of total mobile payment users in the US. While mobile payment adoption among US millennials is expected to see healthy growth, Gen Xer and baby boomer shoppers will also increase their usage of such services. eMarketer expects the number of mobile payment users to jump from 50.8 million to 76.0 million, or 24.3% to 33.1% of total smartphone users, between 2017 and 2020. For all the growth, though, mobile payments still make up only a tiny portion of overall spending. eMarketer expects total mobile payment transaction value to more than double this year to reach $62.49 billion—a heady total, but a mere 1.2% of this year's projected $5 trillion in retail sales. —Alison McCarthy New in eMarketer PRO This Week StatPack: Global Mobile Payments Report: US Affluents 2017 Report: Digital Video Advertising Best Practices 2017 Report: UK Mobile Payments Not a PRO subscriber?

Yes No View Results  Loading ... Follow @LethHerald on twitter By Sudhin Thanawala, The Associated Press on January 25, 2017. SAN FRANCISCO – A federal judge on Wednesday refused to force Wal-Mart to pay $80 million in penalties in a lawsuit alleging the retail giant failed to pay hundreds of truck drivers in California the minimum wage for certain tasks. Wal-Mart acted in good faith when paying the drivers and had reason to believe its payment policy aligned with California law, according to U.S. District Judge Susan Illston in San Francisco. A jury awarded the workers more than $54 million in back wages in November after finding that Wal-Mart didn’t pay the drivers the state’s base wage for inspecting their vehicles before and after trips and for taking 10-hour layovers and 10-minute rest breaks. Attorneys for the drivers had asked Illston to award an additional $80 million in penalties and damages. An email to their lawyer was not immediately returned Wednesday. “While we still disagree with the jury’s verdict on the case, we’re pleased the judge declined to award any additional penalties,” said Randy Hargrove, a Wal-Mart spokesman. Arkansas-based Wal-Mart Stores Inc. said its drivers earn among the highest salaries in the field and that the plaintiffs were “overreaching.” The company has said its drivers earn from about $80,000 to more than $100,000 a year. Illston largely agreed with Wal-Mart, citing testimony that she said showed Wal-Mart’s compensation was among the highest in the trucking industry. Attorneys for Wal-Mart also had said in a court filing that “reasonable minds could differ” about the legality of its pay and layover policies. The judge said Wal-Mart’s payment policy developed in an “uncertain” legal landscape, giving the company reasonable grounds to believe it was complying with California minimum wage law. Illston did award the drivers nearly $6 million in restitution for an additional year that they say Wal-Mart violated minimum wage law but was not covered by the jury’s verdict. Wal-Mart drivers are not paid by the hour. Wages are based on mileage and specified activities. The company argued during trial that it paid drivers for activities that included smaller tasks and could not have a separate payment designation for everything they did, some of which took just minutes. Wal-Mart pays drivers $42 for 10-hour overnight layovers as an extra benefit, but it does not control their time during that period, Scott Edelman, an attorney for the company, said during trial. Drivers are free to go to the movies, exercise or do other activities, he said. 000000 000000 Leave a Reply Click here to cancel reply. You must be logged in to post a comment.

By Krystal Steinmetz on January 25, 2017 Photo by Antoniodiaz / Shutterstock.com You might soon find yourself driving out of the Walmart parking lot with a trunk full of groceries in a brand-new car. The retail giant has partnered with auto-buying program CarSaver to start selling new and used cars to consumers, Automotive News reports. Walmart plans to roll out CarSaver’s online auto retail platform at 25 of its big-box stores beginning in April, Consumerist reports. Select Walmart stores in Houston, Dallas, Phoenix and Oklahoma City will also offer one-stop shopping for car purchases and financing through CarSaver. The CarSaver platform allows a shopper to choose, finance and insure a vehicle through its website or a touch-screen kiosk. Automotive News explains how Walmart’s new car-buying program will work: Customers will be able to select a new, used or certified pre-owned vehicle and apply for financing and auto insurance on the kiosk at the CarSaver Center, on their mobile device via CarSaver’s website or by calling an 800 number. Then CarSaver will connect customers with an AutoNation dealership or other local dealership, where buyers can complete the purchasing paperwork and drive away in a new car. If a car deal is successful, CarSaver will pay the dealership a “success fee” of approximately $350. According to Consumerist, Walmart tested the new car-buying program at one of its Florida stores in 2016. It was wildly successful. “[Eighty] percent of appointments set by Walmart customers resulted in a sale that averaged more than $3,000 in savings for buyers,” Consumerist explains.

REUTERS/John Gress/Files A federal judge refused to order Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) to pay $80 million in penalties in a lawsuit alleging the retailer failed to pay hundreds of truck drivers in California the minimum compensation for certain tasks, the Associated Press reported. U.S. District Judge Susan Illston in San Francisco ruled on Wednesday that Wal-Mart acted in good faith when paying the drivers and reasonably believed its payment policy aligned with California law, AP reported. apne.ws/2jTppuK Current and former Wal-Mart truck drivers in California sued the company in 2008, claiming a plan that compensated drivers by mileage and activity rather than hours worked violated state law. The company dropped the plan in 2015. In November 2016, a jury held that Wal-Mart owed the drivers backpay and handed down a $55 million verdict against the company for failing to pay about 850 of its truck drivers all of the compensation to which they were entitled. "While we still disagree with the jury's verdict in the case, we're pleased the judge declined to award any additional penalties," Wal-Mart said in an emailed statement. U.S. District Judge Susan Illston in San Francisco previously ruled that Wal-Mart violated California law for not paying its truck drivers minimum wage for all work performed. Illston left the determination of damages for trial. Lawyers for the drivers had asked Illston to award an additional $80 million in penalties and damages. Wal-Mart said that its drivers were among the highest paid in the industry, earning about $80,000 to over $100,000 per year, adding that drivers were paid in compliance with California law and often in excess of what California law requires.

He had been released from the Belmont Correctional Institution that day, prior to committing the offense. Theft, Mayfield Road: A mixer motor was reported stolen from a construction site at Marc's Jan. 11. It had been dropped off there Jan. 6 and was valued at $1,500. Drug abuse, Mayfield Road: Officers responded to Taco Bell around 1 a.m. Jan. 16 for a report of a woman passed out behind the wheel in the drive-thru. She did not seem impaired when they woke her, but they detected an odor of marijuana and found some of it inside the vehicle. The Beachwood woman, 23, said her sister had smoked in the vehicle earlier and the marijuana belonged to her. She was cited for driving under suspension and drug possession. Theft, Mayfield Road: A Cleveland woman, 55, was arrested Jan. 14 after she left Giant Eagle without paying for $167.29 worth of groceries. She was located crossing Victory Drive and had eight packages of steaks in her sweater and eight packages of shrimp in a bag. She was later taken to the hospital after complaining of a swollen hand. Reports indicate she had complained of the same problem when she was arrested three days earlier at Walmart for theft. She was charged with theft, possession of criminal tools, obstructing official business and failing to stop for an officer. Counterfeiting, Mayfield Road: A cashier at Giant Eagle was suspected of taking in three counterfeit $100 bills from the same customer Jan.9 on three separate transactions. The Cleveland woman, 21, left 20 minutes before the end of her shift because she said her father was gravely ill and might not make it through the night. The bills were marked with a Turkish word that when translated meant fake or counterfeit. The incident is under investigation. Animal complaint, BayardRoad: Officers responded to a report Jan. 14 of a dog running loose in the area. The resident, whose home the dog belonged, told officers it was her nephew's dog and she would not accept a citation. She also told an officer to "taze" the dog because it was not going to stop running from him. The woman, 38, was cited for dogs at large. Officers returned to the area Jan. 19 when the dog got loose again. The woman again said it was her nephew's dog and she did not want it at the home. She said it ran past her when she was taking her own dog outside. She was cited once again. Burglary, East Berwald Road: A man and woman reported Jan. 15 their home had been broken into and a TV, wedding ring and laptop computer had been stolen. Entry was believed to have been made through a kitchen window. The ring was valued at $3,200. There were no suspects identified. Burglary, East Berwald Road: A woman reported Jan. 14 someone had entered her home while she was at work, but nothing appeared to be missing. She said a package had been opened that she had placed on the kitchen floor and a knife was removed from a drawer and left on a cabinet. Someone also went through dresser drawers. Entry was believed to have been made through a rear door, which was found with a broken window pane. Theft, Edmond Drive: A woman said Jan. 10 she realized her debit card was missing after she had last used it at Dunkin Donuts Jan. 5. She also learned a check for $2,847 had been deposited into the account at an ATM and someone then used the account to make a $2,019 purchase at a Walmart store of an unspecified location. A second charge for $602 was also made at a Cleveland Walmart store and a withdrawal of $80 was made from an ATM. The incident is being investigated by her bank's fraud department. The woman said the card's PIN was written on the card. Robbery, Monticello Boulevard: A BP clerk reported around 7 p.m. Jan. 15 a man handed her a Family Dollar bag and told her to fill it with money or he would shoot her. She said the suspect had been in the store earlier to buy a can of beer, but did not have enough money. He did not show a weapon, but kept his hand by his waist band. Officers spoke to employees at the neighboring Family Dollar and learned a man matching the description of the suspect was in the store and had purchased a greeting card. The clerk believed there was a greeting card inside the bag. It was believed the suspect received about $80 from clerk. She said he is a regular customer, who frequently comes to buy beer. Robbery, Warrensville Center Road: A woman, 65, had her purse stolen around 7:15 p.m. Jan. 11 while she was loading items into her vehicle at Walmart. She tried to fight off the three male suspects, but fell to the ground. They left in a vehicle and she tried to follow them, as did a witness, who was not identified. She later learned one of the credit cards from her purse had been used fraudulently at an Express Gas Station at an unknown location. Theft, Warrensville Center Road: Officers received a report Jan. 16 of a man at Walmart placing a fire hydrant into the trunk of his vehicle. They did not locate him, but learned the identity of the man when they ran a check of his license plates. The man was contacted and responded to the station to return the fire hydrant. He said he had found it in the roadway in Cleveland and placed it into his trunk so nobody would run into it. When he was at Walmart placing items into the trunk, he realized it was still in there so he was rearranging items to get everything to fit. It was later learned the color of the hydrant matched the color scheme of those in Cleveland. It is valued at approximately $4,400. Disorderly conduct, Cedar Road: Officers responded to Jimmy John's sub shop Jan. 18 for a report of a woman who was throwing bags of chips and cookies around the restaurant. The manager said the woman had complained about a sandwich she received hours earlier and got upset because she was only being offered another sandwich or gift card for the price of the original order. He said she began to swear at employees, threw items around and picked up a chair in an attempt to throw it through a window. The South Euclid woman, 22, told police she felt disrespected by employees and decided to throw bags of chips and cookies. She said she was hit in the back with a sandwich that was thrown by an unknown person and manager closed the door preventing her from leaving. She was subsequently charged with disorderly conduct.

Wal-Mart acted in good faith when paying the drivers and had reason to believe its payment policy aligned with California law, according to U.S. District Judge Susan Illston in San Francisco. A jury awarded the workers more than $54 million in back wages in November after finding that Wal-Mart didn't pay the drivers the state's base wage for inspecting their vehicles before and after trips and for taking 10-hour layovers and 10-minute rest breaks. Attorneys for the drivers had asked Illston to award an additional $80 million in penalties and damages. An email to their lawyer was not immediately returned Wednesday. "While we still disagree with the jury's verdict on the case, we're pleased the judge declined to award any additional penalties," said Randy Hargrove, a Wal-Mart spokesman. Arkansas-based Wal-Mart Stores Inc. said its drivers earn among the highest salaries in the field and that the plaintiffs were "overreaching." The company has said its drivers earn from about $80,000 to more than $100,000 a year. Illston largely agreed with Wal-Mart, citing testimony that she said showed Wal-Mart's compensation was among the highest in the trucking industry. Attorneys for Wal-Mart also had said in a court filing that "reasonable minds could differ" about the legality of its pay and layover policies. The judge said Wal-Mart's payment policy developed in an "uncertain" legal landscape, giving the company reasonable grounds to believe it was complying with California minimum wage law. Illston did award the drivers nearly $6 million in restitution for an additional year that they say Wal-Mart violated minimum wage law but was not covered by the jury's verdict. Wal-Mart drivers are not paid by the hour. Wages are based on mileage and specified activities. The company argued during trial that it paid drivers for activities that included smaller tasks and could not have a separate payment designation for everything they did, some of which took just minutes. Wal-Mart pays drivers $42 for 10-hour overnight layovers as an extra benefit, but it does not control their time during that period, Scott Edelman, an attorney for the company, said during trial. Drivers are free to go to the movies, exercise or do other activities, he said. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The company had argued that it paid drivers for activities that included smaller tasks. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it One of the Macy’s stores the company plans to close. (Mike Blake/Reuters) By George F. Will By George F. Will Opinion writer January 25 Follow @georgewill When the president speaks of closed factories scattered like “tombstones” across America, has he noticed the shuttered stores in shopping centers, and entire malls reduced to rubble? He promises “protection” to prevent foreigners from “destroying” manufacturing jobs by exporting to America things that Americans want to import. Does he know that one American company might be “destroying” more American jobs than China is? And that this supposed destruction is beneficial? The company is Amazon (market capitalization: $390 billion), created by Jeffrey P. Bezos. He owns The Post, but it is for revolutionizing retailing that he ranks in the pantheon of American business. He belongs there with Richard Warren Sears, Alvah Curtis Roebuck, Aaron Montgomery Ward and Sam Walton, all of whom were constructively disruptive retailers and were as important in the nation’s commercial history as were Henry Ford, Steve Jobs and Bill Gates. In 2016, online buying during the holiday season surged 19 percent over the year before, which is one factor explaining this: Macy’s, after announcing in August that it would close 100 more of its remaining 730 stores, now says it will shed 10,000 jobs. Sears, which is 13 decades old and still has 1,600 stores, has lost $9 billion in five years, has closed 500 stores and is closing 150 more (including some Kmarts). Sears stores in American downtowns, and the Sears catalogue that put downtown goods within reach of rural America (3 million catalogues were distributed in 1907, when the nation’s population was 87 million), caused difficulties for older retailers. In the second half of the 20th century, Walmarts at the edge of towns caused difficulties for downtown retailers with pre-modern — meaning pre-Walmart — global supply chains. Now Amazon is forcing Walmart to master online retailing. Although e-commerce was just 8 percent of all 2016 retail sales, it came disproportionately at the expense of Sears, Macy’s and other “anchor tenants” that draw foot traffic from which other mall retailers benefit. When Amazon recently announced that it is going to create 100,000 warehousing and other jobs in the next 18 months, the New York Times reported that online retailing “has destroyed many times that number of positions at malls and shopping centers across America.” The Times quoted specialists’ calculations that traditional retailers have shed more than 200,000 employees in the past four years, and that there are 1.2 million fewer retail workers than there would be if there were no online retailers. But Henry Ford, too, “destroyed” lots of jobs — those of blacksmiths, buggy-makers, etc. — the holders of which moved on, and usually up. Writing at MarketWatch, Rex Nutting argues that as Amazon revolutionizes consumer behavior, it “is going to destroy more American jobs than China ever did.” If so, the “problem” is productivity. Nutting says “Amazon needs about half as many workers to sell $100 worth of merchandise as Macy’s does.” The Times reports that “the typical online retailer generates $1,267,000 in sales per employee versus $279,000 at bricks-and-mortar stores.” All of which raises a question: Why should manufacturing jobs lost to foreign competition be privileged by protectionist policies in ways that jobs lost to domestic competition are not? When an Applebee’s or Olive Garden, powered by a national advertising budget, opens next to, and causes the closing of, Madge’s Diner, why does Madge not merit protection? Or the Trade Adjustment Assistance that is available for workers, firms, farmers, even communities that can plausibly claim to have been otherwise injured by foreign competition or outsourcing of jobs? The reason is this: Domestic protection of Madge and millions of others unsettled by the constant churning of a dynamic domestic economy would mean slow economic growth — and rapid growth of government as it regulates consumers’ choices and their consequences. But protection from imports also means this. Reactionary liberalism has long held, and today’s faux conservatism agrees, that existing jobs should be protected by policies that reduce the economic dynamism that threatens those jobs. Such protection means a net decrease in jobs but an increase in the self-esteem of blinkered protectionists who see the jobs “saved” but not those that, as a result of lost dynamism, are lost or never created. Macy’s flagship Manhattan store was one reason Gimbels’s nearby flagship closed, after 76 years, in 1986. This, even though in 1945 Gimbels had been America’s first merchant to offer “a fantastic, atomic era, miraculous pen.” It was a ballpoint. Will the winner of the once-famous Macy’s vs. Gimbels rivalry always be with us? Probably not, which is probably good. (Reuters) Read more from George F. Will’s archive or follow him on Facebook.

Wal-Mart acted in good faith when paying the drivers and had reason to believe its payment policy aligned with California law, according to U.S. District Judge Susan Illston in San Francisco. A jury awarded the workers more than $54 million in back wages in November after finding that Wal-Mart didn't pay the drivers the state's base wage for inspecting their vehicles before and after trips and for taking 10-hour layovers and 10-minute rest breaks. Attorneys for the drivers had asked Illston to award an additional $80 million in penalties and damages. An email to their lawyer was not immediately returned Wednesday. "While we still disagree with the jury's verdict on the case, we're pleased the judge declined to award any additional penalties," said Randy Hargrove, a Wal-Mart spokesman. Arkansas-based Wal-Mart Stores Inc. said its drivers earn among the highest salaries in the field and that the plaintiffs were "overreaching." The company has said its drivers earn from about $80,000 to more than $100,000 a year. Illston largely agreed with Wal-Mart, citing testimony that she said showed Wal-Mart's compensation was among the highest in the trucking industry. Attorneys for Wal-Mart also had said in a court filing that "reasonable minds could differ" about the legality of its pay and layover policies. The judge said Wal-Mart's payment policy developed in an "uncertain" legal landscape, giving the company reasonable grounds to believe it was complying with California minimum wage law. Illston did award the drivers nearly $6 million in restitution for an additional year that they say Wal-Mart violated minimum wage law but was not covered by the jury's verdict. Wal-Mart drivers are not paid by the hour. Wages are based on mileage and specified activities. The company argued during trial that it paid drivers for activities that included smaller tasks and could not have a separate payment designation for everything they did, some of which took just minutes. Wal-Mart pays drivers $42 for 10-hour overnight layovers as an extra benefit, but it does not control their time during that period, Scott Edelman, an attorney for the company, said during trial. Drivers are free to go to the movies, exercise or do other activities, he said. Share or comment on this article e-mail Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

Instead what Walmart did was launch its own mobile payments service in the form of Walmart Pay, and it looks like Walmart might have inspired other retailers to follow suit. In a report from Recode, it seems that Target has confirmed that they have plans for their own mobile payments service. This is according to Target’s Chief Information and Digital Officer Michael McNamara who revealed the company’s plans to Recode at the National Retail Federation conference last week. At the moment details are a bit scarce, but McNamara revealed that the service will only be available to Target shoppers with a REDcard, or at least that will be the case at the start. For those unfamiliar, the REDcard is a debit/credit card for Target that offers up discounts and other perks when you use it at the store. With this move it is more than likely than Target will not be introducing Apple Pay anytime soon, or other mobile payment providers for that matter. However if you do want to use Apple Pay, note that you can use it when making purchases within Target’s app, just not in the stores. Filed in General. Read more about target.

Yucatan would have at least one of these logistics centers. The moves are expected to generate about 10 thousand jobs in the region. The director of Corporate Communication Walmart Mexico and Central America, Antonio Ocaranza Fernandez, reported that the group has a line of five businesses: in Yucatan they already have 39 commercial spaces and this year they will open their store number 40 in Mérida, which will involve an investment of 3.4 billion pesos and more than 3,500 direct jobs. Walmart plans a new distribution center in Yucatan to improve supplies for its stores in the region. (PHOTO: sipse.com) This year they will begin to “probe” with local and municipal authorities the location of spaces for the installation of this infrastructure. Its objective is to exercise $1.2 billion USD in the next 10 years, and to generate 10 thousand jobs. With these logistics spaces, the aim is to reduce times and costs in the supply process. Ocaranza Fernández said that the company has a presence in the state through six brands: Sam’s Club, with three stores; Superama, one; Walmart, six; Bodegas Aurrera, ten; My Bodega Aurrerá, 11; Bodega Aurrerá Express, five, and Suburbia. He said that soon they will sell the country’s Suburbia stores to Liverpool, as in 2013 they did with the VIP’s and three other brands to Alsea, a consortium that manages some of the top food franchises. Its presence in Yucatán began in 1995 with the opening of the first price club, and the last one was a Walmart in the area of Altabrisa; Its presence in the entity grew significantly, 30 percent from 2012 to 2015, and during that time it opened 12 businesses. They have presence in 14 municipalities and do not rule out continuing to reach other areas.

Gisel Ruiz will transition to the role of executive vice president of operations for Sam’s Club as Don Frieson, who has held that role since 2012, exits the company. Frieson said he is retiring from Sam’s Club and Wal-Mart where he has spent the past 18 years in executive roles from logistics and supply chain to regional operations for Walmart to working in Africa for two years integrating Massmart into Wal-Mart and most recently overseeing all operations for Sam’s Club in the U.S. and Puerto Rico. Frieson made his retirement public with the following post on LinkedIn earlier this week: “As of January 31, 2017 I will retire after an 18 year career with Walmart. I’ve had the great fortune to work across the business supporting great associates in the Private Fleet, Logistics, Wal-Mart Stores division, Walmart International (South Africa) and Sam’s Club.” Karenann Terrell, chief information officer Walmart, credited Frieson with being an exceptional leader. “Retirement? You? You’ve got way too much game still left and the world needs your force for good right about now … I learned a ton about being a good associate and a good person from you. Act 2 coming up,” Terrell noted on the post. Terrell is also exiting the retail giant next month, but has yet to disclose her next move. Terrell will be replaced by Clay Johnson, chief information officer for G.E. Power. Gisel Ruiz will be executive vice president of operations for Sam’s Club effective Feb. 1. Furner sent a memo Jan. 13 to employees detailing several key management changes at Sam’s Club. The retailer shared that memo with Talk Business & Politics on Wednesday (Jan. 25). Furner is charged with growing Sam’s Club business while also taking care of its expanding member base ensuring the shopping experience from merchandise selection to seamless checkout continues to improve. The team lining up behind Furner has nearly 80 years of combined experience at Wal-Mart or Sam’s Club, and is also sprinkled with some new emerging talent. Ruiz, like Furner has grown up in Wal-Mart, after signing on to the retailer’s management training program almost 25 years ago. Ruiz spent the past two years out of the U.S. limelight as executive vice president for the International People Division at Wal-Mart, where she supported human resource efforts for more than a million employees in 26 countries. Prior to that, Ruiz was promoted to chief operations officer for Walmart U.S. working with Duncan MacNaughton in February 2012 at the same time Brewer was named CEO of Sam’s Club. Ruiz also had additional responsibilities of oversight of U.S. Asset Protection Real Estate and Store Innovations, under then Walmart U.S. CEO Bill Simon. Ruiz was replaced as chief operations officer for Walmart U.S. by Judith McKenna in December 2014 by Greg Foran, CEO of Walmart U.S. Ruiz is now moving back into operations, but this time on a smaller scale given that Sam’s Club has roughly 660 clubs around the country, compared to more than 4,400 Walmart U.S. stores. During Ruiz’s tenure at Walmart she floated back and forth from human resources and operations but she has been recognized as one of the top 25 powerful minority women in business by the Minority Enterprise Executive Council. During her two-year stint as chief operations officer for Walmart U.S., Ruiz helped to oversee the opening of 400 stores across the country, many of which were Neighborhood Market formats. Furner said the combination of deep retail experience, strong people leadership and her passion for serving customers will allow Ruiz to make an immediate impact on the Sam’s Club business. Ashley Buchanan will replace Furner as chief merchandising officer for Sam’s Club. Buchanan most recently served as senior vice president of packaged goods at Walmart U.S. He joined Walmart in 2007 as part of the Walmart Innovations Team and has since held several leadership roles in Walmart’s Food Division. Furner said Buchanan will be responsible for continuing the charge to make the product the hero in the warehouse clubs. Also retiring from Sam’s Club is Seong Ohm. Ohm spent 13 years between Wal-Mart and Sam’s Club positions, most recently launching nine new services, including auto buying and travel and overseeing the credit team on negotiating and launching one of the largest retail credit programs. Furner said as Ohm retires Sam’s Club will beef up its merchandising team with the addition of Lance de la Rosa who’ll be moving from operations to senior vice president of merchandise execution. He will report to Buchanan. Rosa has 30 years experience in Wal-Mart operations, international and most recently Sam’s Club. Tracey Brown, another up and comer at Sam’s Club overseeing membership for the past couple of years, will transition into the senior vice president of operations and chief experience officer role. Membership growth was one of the biggest successes at Sam’s Club in recent years and Brown is being asked to apply her expertise to the operations division. Furner said Brown “will bring a fresh perspective to the in-club experience, using data and analytics to reinvent the way members shop our clubs, while also simplifying our in-club processes and running clean, fast and friendly clubs.” Sam’s Club is also restructuring its regional management teams and reducing the number of regions from six to five. The new management alignment and leadership is: Missy Craig – South Central Region; Kevin Buncum – North Central Region; Sean Mehranbod – Western Region; Betty Marshall – Southeast Region; and Steve Schrobilgen – Northeast Region.

It is the first of its kind in Knoxville, and dozens of people lined up for the grand opening. “I was amazed when I walked in, never been in one before. It’s not like the huge Walmarts where you have to walk around and everything is like right at your beck and call,” said Shana Love. The concept is new to Knoxville. It is a smaller version of the traditional Walmart stores that focuses on groceries and convenience for the shoppers. Each store has a deli, pizza bakery, and a place for customers to pick up items they order online. Previous story: Walmart Neighborhood Market opening soon in Knoxville “We’ve got some great products for them. We’re going to be really easy convenient for them to come in right after work, pick up the things they need every day, and Walmart’s everyday low prices. We just really hope they take advantage of that,” said Store Manager Bryan Spears. There is also the gas station on site which they say will stay in line with Walmart’s low price guarantee. “The gas is going to be one of my favorite things to get around here. It’s going to be very convenient and I hope the prices are going to be very low,” Love said. There were several speakers at the grand opening, including Knox County Mayor Tim Burchett, State Senator Dr. Richard Briggs and Knoxville Deputy to the Mayor Christi Branscom. Burchett said he hopes the new store is a good sign for what is to come in Knoxville and Knox County this year. “I think consumer confidence is rising and it’s showing corporate America is investing, and they’re going to continue to, all the indications that we’ve had. And the increase in building permits and things like that are up dramatically over what they were this time last year,” he said. For people who live around there, it is a good sign of growth in their neighborhood. “This store is amazing. It’s nice. It’s convenient, and it’s beautiful,” Love said. There are three other Walmart Neighborhood Markets in surrounding counties. One is in Sevierville, and there are two in Morristown.

Jan 19, 2017 3 ways to strategically improve your ranching legacy Jan 26, 2017 brought to you by Marketing>Outlook Beef has a flower shop problem Comparing Walmart to a small-town flower shop shows cheaper pricing is king. Comparing beef with its alternatives is no different. Alan Newport | Jan 25, 2017 My wife operates a flower and gift shop in our small town, and despite her amazing ability to create artistic, high-quality floral designs, she just can't compete with the nearby Walmart store when pricing and selling these gift items.  The cost of small wholesale purchases, plus shipping and the breadth of the giant chain's offerings, simply makes it difficult to sell something in her shop that people can't buy cheaper or at least substitute a purchase of something cheaper just a few miles away at Walmart. Neither can any of the other small retailers, and the breadcrumbs left after the consumers get done with their primary shopping at Walmart or with online retailers is barely a fit meal for a mouse.  That's because saving money is an American obsession and it applies to the purchase of beef, pork and chicken in roughly the same manner it applies to our flower and gift shop. In the eyes of the consumer, who has limited income, quality is nice but low price can be nicer.  To put the beef discussion in context of our small-town shop, people may like the tasteful, high-quality Christmas ornaments my wife sells (like beef), but a majority of what they put on the tree was purchased at discount-store prices (like chicken).  When the oilfield is rolling around here, cattle prices are up, and wheat and soybean prices are above average, customers are likely to buy a little more of those tasteful ornaments (beef). But they will still buy more chicken (cheap ornaments) overall.  Maybe they'll step in and buy a little extra quality after Christmas when it goes on sale (like ground beef). But a lot of Christmas trees still will be filled with cheaper ornaments, even in the good times (chicken).  The thing that concerns me even more is the poor prospects for the sale of "quality" now that the economy is weak. This affects my wife's retail sales and it potentially affects beef.  This so-called recovery since 2008 has been pathetic and is due to run out of steam. In fact, if you measure it with gross domestic product (GDP), we've been in a depression worse than the 10 years of the Great Depression of 1929-1939.  I read a lot of economic literature, but especially from people who forecast trends, particularly macro-economic ones. Harry Dent is one of those, and his data says the retirement of the baby boom will slow the economy dramatically, in addition to three other economic cycles. Jim Rickards is another. His analyses are partially based on what I would call political trends. He says a confluence of factors, including an overdue stock market correction, the downfall of China and massive U.S. budget deficits will cause a recession by this spring.  The third whose material I subscribe to is David Stockman, the former congressman and budget manager for Ronald Reagan’s administration. In short, Stockman says the Federal Reserve's funny money policies, together with peak debt in all sectors of society, together with the irrational exuberance of what he calls the "casinos" on Wall Street, are heading for a comeuppance.  I can find no reason to fault any of these soothsayers, as it matches the reality I've been following for several years now. Both Stockman and Rickards emphasize the problems coming with the end of the last debt ceiling agreement upcoming on March 16 and the fact Congress and the new president must deal with this gargantuan issue.  If you want a bit of upbeat news, private economist Bill Helming, who was the first economist for the National Cattlemen's Association, now thinks we are less likely to fall into serious recession. But his latest outlook for cattle and grain prices is not pretty, and he believes we have some distance to travel yet in the land-price downfall.  On a positive note, we're already seeing the Trump administration rolling back regulations and hopefully that will continue. Goodness knows he and Congress have hundreds to repeal just from the last three presidents.  So, as the larger economy weakens across the world, and as we face that wall of meat from all three major protein industries, including our own beef industry, my suggestion is to get your costs down, clear out as much debt as possible, sell excess holdings and wait for opportunities. This resonates with the title of Harry Dent's new book, "The Sale of a Lifetime." We must still be cautious, and the wise will pinch their pennies and wait patiently.   TAGS: Ranching 0 comments Hide comments Comment * More information about text formats Text format CommentsPlain text Comments Allowed HTML tags: <em> <strong> <blockquote> <br> <p> Plain text No HTML tags allowed.

Gleaners utilized the funds to purchase a refrigerated truck and walk-in freezer that will support the Monroe County Opportunity Program (MCOP). With the grant-funded resources, Gleaners expects to increase retail donations in Monroe County from approximately 60,000 lbs. of food per year to 200,000 lbs. per year. "We are extremely grateful to Walmart and Feeding America for making the donation of this refrigerated truck and walk-in freezer possible. These additions will provide MCOP with greater capacity for retail donations of fresh produce, frozen meat and other healthy foods throughout the year, benefitting our many hungry neighbors in Monroe County," said Gleaners Chief Operating Officer, Julie Beamer. According to a 2015 study from Feeding America, the food insecurity rate within Monroe County is 12.8 percent with more than 19,000 food insecure individuals. MCOP is a Partner Distribution Organization (PDO) of Gleaners that serves the majority of food distribution programs in Monroe County and aims to improve access to nutrition in rural areas. Gleaners is focused on strengthening and expanding their most effective programs with a goal of increasing economic impact to households by 20 percent. "Through this wonderful donation, MCOP will be able to increase access to food for our most vulnerable residents in the community," says MCOP Executive Director Stephanie Kasprzak. "Our work with Gleaners and Walmart continues to expand our capacity to feed more people and we are extremely grateful. Gleaners' mission aligns directly with the Walmart Foundation's sustainability initiatives around reducing food waste across the supply chain and diverting underutilized food into the charitable food system. Walmart's main goal for the grant is to help Gleaners advance their retail donation program by providing assets that support growth. ·      Photo Album: https://goo.gl/photos/ozyrytWqrb6FMqHe9 About Gleaners Food Bank of Southeastern Michigan For 40 years, Gleaners Community Food Bank has been "feeding hungry people and nourishing our communities." Last year, Gleaners distributed more than 38 million pounds of emergency food to over 534 partner schools, soup kitchens, shelters and pantries in Wayne, Oakland, Macomb, Livingston and Monroe counties. Of every dollar donated, Gleaners uses 94 cents for food and food programs. One dollar provides three meals for a hungry neighbor.

The Supply Side is managed by Talk Business & Politics and sponsored by Propak Logistics. –––––––––––––––––––––– Wal-Mart is cutting an estimated 200 jobs from its replenishment operations as part of the around 1,000 corporate jobs cuts announced Jan. 20. On Monday the retailer sent at least two documents to suppliers outlining the restructuring of replenishment functions. The memo sent to suppliers outlined Wal-Mart’s desire to transform the business for shoppers by first revamping how it operates internally. The memo was accompanied by a PowerPoint presentation with graphics illustrating the structural changes. “We believe more than ever in using our strengths to exceed our customer’s expectations. Our emphasis now is on reshaping our organization in ways that will deliver those expectations, as well as improve associate and inventory efficiency that will position us all for the future. We have created roles that will enable associates to specialize on key components of replenishment,” Wal-Mart noted in the memo to suppliers. Wal-Mart wants suppliers to have more focused communication that is concise and actionable. On this point, the retailer gave suppliers a list of instances where the retailer should hear from suppliers. In the past the replenishment manager has been the contact person for suppliers to handle a myriad of issues whether it was about items out-of-stock, logistics and supply chain, seasonal inventory, modular processes or store support. The new configuration divides those responsibilities among four people in an effort to lighten the load for replenishment managers and create a replenishment team with each member dedicated to one specific area. Following is the new structure. Replenishment Manager This person will handle inventory management and in-stock, modular processes, feature pricing events, and aligning with the supplier and buyer on common goals. Demand Manager The demand manager will be responsible for forecasting demand, planning for seasonal items and managing safety stock. Supplier Solutions Manager This person will have the responsibility of supplier training, supplier setup and maintenance and on-time-in-full deliveries of product. Business Support Manager This person will be the one to research store and distribution center issues pertaining to product displays and in-stocks, category management and reporting to the other team members and suppliers. Three of the four replenishment team members will interact regularly with suppliers in the following ways. If a supplier has a question about an item, they will contact the replenishment manager who will research in-stock and fill-rate exceptions. This person will also be responsible for planning a pricing event such as a rollback. If the supplier has a question about remedying a problem such as out-of-stock then they would reach out to the Business Support Manager who will find a solution. If the supplier’s question involves a truck then it’s more a supply-chain issue and the Supplier Solutions Manager is the person to call. Wal-Mart said it will take a few weeks for these new teams to get up to speed in the new organizational plan, and asked for suppliers’ patience as the changes are implemented. Wal-Mart said the replenishment manager and the business solutions manager are the primary supplier contacts for most issues, which will free up time for the demand manager to focus on forecasting and increase system expertise. Consultants representing suppliers told Talk Business & Politics the plan looks good on paper but execution is critical and it’s too early to tell if the new structure will benefit suppliers. One of the biggest complaints voiced by suppliers in recent years has been the difficulty in getting a replenishment manager to return a call or email, because of the heavy workload they were under. In the old system the replenishment solved for everything that could be wrong and that often meant searching multiple systems for possible answers. This was a timely and less-than effective way to help suppliers get to the root cause of their out-of-stock issues. Clint Lazenby, a supplier consultant for private label, said replenishment managers were spread too line under the old system and he likes the possibilities of the new team approach. He said the new structure better aligns with suppliers and manufacturers. Other suppliers said they were glad to get the information and are hoping they have an opportunity to learn more at supplier meetings set for Feb. 14 and 15 in Bentonville. Suppliers said they understand how important communication is and one concern they have at the present time involves knowing if their replenishment manager under the old system will still be their point of contact through this transition.

Tech Entertainment Business Social Deals Podcast About 3D Image Source: JeepersMedia Walmart is going to start selling cars because why not? Mike Wehner @MikeWehner January 24th, 2017 at 10:04 PM Share Tweet You can already buy just about anything you need at Walmart, and now the mega retailer is going to start selling something you probably never expected: cars. Yep, the country’s biggest store chain will provide car-buying services at 25 of its largest stores in Texas, Arizona, and Oklahoma, allowing you to walk into the store for a gallon of milk and walk out with a new gas-guzzling SUV. Isn’t America wonderful?  Don't Miss: T-Mobile employees share horror stories of lies and bill cramming in ‘wild outlaw’ stores As Automotive News reports, selected Walmart stores won’t actually be operating themselves as dealerships, however, but will instead partner with dealership groups to provide access to car-buying terminals within its stores. Much like Walmart provides spaces for banks, credit unions, fast food chains and even doctors to operate within its stores, the auto sales will be conducted from a small shop in the front of the store. Customers will be able to purchase cars via CarSaver, a digital platform which utilizes touchscreen kiosks so shoppers can browse a selection of new and used vehicles and even get approved for financing and insurance right from within the Walmart. It sounds like a slick little system, but here’s the catch: the cars aren’t actually at Walmart at all. Customers can’t test drive them or kick the tires at the store, but instead have to travel to the actual car dealership that has the car they wanted. If a customer actually follows through and purchases the vehicle, CarSaver gets a “success fee” of $350 or thereabouts. I don’t know about you, but I’ve never tried to get approved for an auto loan before even sitting in the car I wanted to buy, but hey, it’s Walmart after all.

Close January 25, 2017 America's decades-old dealership model has been under attack lately. The best example of comes courtesy of Tesla, which now sells its electric vehicles directly to consumers, both online and in showrooms. To do that, Tesla has fought against dealer networks and longstanding state franchise laws. Now, another offensive has been launched--one that could have a much bigger effect on traditional dealerships because it's centered around America's biggest retailer, Walmart. This week, we learned that the massive, big-box chain store will begin selling both new and used cars, in partnership with the online service CarSaver.   Beginning this spring, Walmart will install "CarSaver Centers" at Supercenter locations, alongside the eyeglass shops and banks already positioned across from the store's checkout lanes. The Centers will feature touchscreen kiosks that allow shoppers to search for both new and used vehicles from CarSaver's network of dealers. Once they've found the right ride, shoppers can apply for financing and set up insurance on the same touchscreen, just as they can on the CarSaver website. Multi-lingual staff will be on hand to help guide consumers through the process.  Afterward, shoppers will be directed to a local dealership to sign the necessary paperwork and pick up their vehicle. CarSaver will receive a $350 "success fee" for completed sales.  The program was piloted in Florida last April. On April 1 of this year, it's expected to debut in 25 Walmart Supercenters in four key markets--Dallas, Houston, Oklahoma City, and Phoenix. There's no word on when it will roll out to Walmart Supercenters in other parts of the country, though CarSaver hopes that'll occur by the end of 2018. Similar programs have been in place at one of Walmart's major competitors, Costco, for years. Costco sells roughly 1,000 new vehicles per store each year. Walmart is aiming to do roughly the same number at each of its Supercenters, though that figure will include both new and used vehicles.  Our take Walmart hasn't commented on this news, and it probably won't for a while. However, if the early reports are accurate, this could be a real game-changer--a win-win-win for Walmart, CarSaver, and consumers. Walmart might not derive any money from individual auto sales, but it will almost certainly earn some revenue from CarSaver, which will be setting up shop in Walmart stores. The company will also benefit from additional foot traffic, and its portfolio of offerings will be expanded, which will likely improve its brand a bit. CarSaver obviously benefits from increased visibility and the opportunity to generate additional revenue--not only from sales in Walmart stores, but also from sales on its website. Given the competitiveness of the online auto sales segment, that's huge.  And consumers stand to win because the car-buying process will be simplified. It's been shown time and again that shoppers hate haggling, and they're uncomfortable with the complexity of auto sales. This arrangement makes the process more streamlined and straightforward.  Even dealers stand to win from this set-up--at least those that belong to the CarSaver network--because they'll have access to larger numbers of shoppers. In fact, the only group that may lose is sales staff, whose role will continue to be minimized.  Have you ever bought a car using a program like this? Would you?

Tech Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies TV Politics Business Super Bowl Ads     NES Classic In Stock At Walmart Stores Posted: Jan 27 2017, 2:41am CST | by Luigi Lugmayr, in News | Technology News   Photo Credit: Getty Images/Nintendo   New Nintendo NES Classic inventory arrives at Walmart stores. Updated. More Walmart stores across the nation have the NES Classic in stock today. The inventory level reported by BrickSeek jumped from 1% to 13%. We have spotted 8 NES in stock at the Walmart Supercenter in Rosemead, Walmart in Burbank has 7 and the Walmart store in Santa Fe Springs as 6 NES consoles in stock. Don't Miss: The Best CES 2017 Gadgets Updates: Jan. 27: Walmart continues to have a 13% inventory level on Thursday. The BrickSeek inventory level of the NES at Target has risen from 5 to 7% again. The Walmart stores remain the better option to find a NES Classic. More people had though luck yesterday at ToysRUs stores. TRU stores that had the NES in stock had a dozen NES on hand. Getting the NES at Walmart stores that show green on BrickSeek reportedly can take some effort and requires to get a hold of a store manager.  Jan. 26: Walmart continues to have a 13% inventory level on Thursday. The BrickSeek inventory level of the NES at Target has dropped to 5%. The Walmart stores are now the better option to find a NES Classic. The Walmart store in Downey in California shows 6 NES Classic in stock this morning. Read below how to search for the NES Classic stock at your local Walmart stores. Several people reported successful NES purchases at Walmart stores this morning on the discussion board at NowInStock. The Target stores have basically been the only source of NES over the past weeks. Besides Walmart, GameStop stores sell the NES Classic again. The video game retailer sent us a statement that their stores are receiving new NES consoles starting now. This morning the Nintendo flagship store in New York has the NES Classic in stock again. The store is opened at 9am ET. It appears that Nintendo has finally shipped a notable number of NES Classic consoles to US retailers, but the demand is still by far higher than the supply. How to Check NES Inventory at Walmart stores The BrickSeek inventory checker for the NES at Walmart can be accessed here. Just type in your ZIP and see if any of your local Walmart stores is marked green. The SKU for the NES Classic Edition is 54043501.  There is renewed interest in the NES after hackers found a way to add more games to the NES Classic that increases the pressure on the NES supply. New tools make it easy for NES owners to open up the system and install more games. The instructions to hack the NES Classic Edition are available. The reseller prices of the NES Classic have come down a bit after the Holidays, but are now increasing again to $150 plus shipping on amazon.com. It is easier to find NES Classic controllers Amazon now, although they are not from Nintendo. The Nyko MiniBoss Wireless Controller for NES Classic Edition in stock at Amazon for $18. The 8Bitdo NES30 Classic Edition Wireless Controller Set with Bluetooth Retro Receiver is also in stock for $39.99. Find all NES Controller on sale at amazon.com. The demand for the NES is still extremely high. Resellers offer the NES on the Amazon marketplace are $150 and up. Nintendo is under criticism for bad demand forecasting since years. Part of it is intentional as shortage generates buzz. The downside are the countless hours of people spent in line and the caused frustration. There is no update from Nintendo when the Japanese video game maker will resolve the shortage. The $59.99 Nintendo NES Classic Edition console launched on November 11 in stores and online. The supply was extremely constraint in stores and especially online. On launch day Nintendo said: "The Nintendo Entertainment System: NES Classic Edition system is a hot item, and we are working hard to keep up with consumer demand. There will be a steady flow of additional systems through the holiday shopping season and into the new year. Please contact your local retailers to check availability." Nintendo did not make any further comments about the NES Classic supply situation since then. Nintendo of America President Reggie Fils-Aime tried to explain last week in an interview why the NES is suffering a shortage.  "When we looked at that proposition what we believed was the adults, 30-40 years old, who grew up playing NES as a kid, 10 years old or so but had stepped away from the gaming category--that was going to be the buyer," Fils-Aime said to GameStop. "As we thought about that, that led us to a certain level of supply. The reality, however, was that the lapsed gamer and the "more active gamer" bought the NES Classic." This is a poor excuse. Nintendo apparently does not do focus groups ahead of console launches. The palm-sized NES console, retailing for $59.99 list price, features the classic Nintendo NES controller many geeks have grown up with. The retro console comes pre-installed with 30 classic NES games including Super Mario Bros., Pac-Man, Metroid, Donkey Kong, The Legend of Zelda and Kirby's Adventures. The NES Classic Edition system is a miniaturized version of the groundbreaking NES, originally released in 1985. The NES Classic Edition comes only with a single wired controller. There are 3rd party controllers and accessories that make the NES more fun to use. Gamers can get additional controllers and even wireless controllers. The Holiday shopping season 2016 has been dominated by the hunt for Hatchimals and the Nintendo NES classic edition. In a short two months the new Nintendo Switch will go sale and Nintendo fans brace for the worst. The Nintendo Switch pre-order are sold out. The supply situation might no be as bad as for the NES, but it will be difficult to get a Switch at launch for customers who have not pre-ordered the Switch.

The retailer reportedly said that its planned mobile payments service, at least initially, would be available to Target REDcard holders. The retailer's new service would challenge Apple Pay, Alphabet's Android Pay, and Samsung Pay. Rival Wal-Mart Stores' Wal-Mart Pay was launched in December 2015, while Kohl's recently added Kohl's Pay, along with its own loyalty and rewards program, into its mobile app. Reuters said it first reported that Target was developing its own mobile payment service in December 2015. The Minneapolis-based company with about 1,800 stores may add mobile payments to its CartWheel application, and potentially its main Target application. The company did not confirm which application would be updated to include mobile payments functionality. Also, it is yet to specify the timing of the launch. As per reports, around 27 million shoppers have used Target's CartWheel application over the past three years since its debut. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Business News Fed Meets First Time Under New Regime – Economic Preview for Week of Jan. 30 The World's 10 Most Productive Nations, Ranked Biotech Stocks Facing FDA Decision In February More Top Stories Trump Signs Order Instituting "Extreme Vetting" Of Immigrants Stocks Close Roughly Flat For Second Straight Day - U.S. Commentary Abercrombie & Fitch Issues 150 Pink Slips Trump Discusses Mexico, Russia, Brexit In News Conference With May Trump To Speak With Putin By Phone On Saturday Feds Claim Breathometer Made False Claims About Accuracy Trump Expresses Support For "Nuclear Option" Over Supreme Court Nominee Stocks Continue To Lack Direction In Mid-Day Trading - U.S. Commentary Stocks Continue To Experience Choppy Trading - U.S. Commentary Report: Wet Seal Will Go Extinct Trump Accuses Mexico Of Taking Advantage Of U.S. Study Shows How Jet Lag Affects Baseball Teams McDonald's Sells All Of Its Nordic Restaurants U.S. Consumer Sentiment Reaches Thirteen-Year High In January Tim Hortons Coming To Mexico <<Previous        81 Articles Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus RELATED NEWS Target Corp.

For this venture, CarSaver is partnering with dealership groups such as AutoNation and financing companies such as Ally Financial. CarSaver kiosks will be set up at Walmart, and customers buying the cars will receive help in making their purchases through Walmart employees, Automotive News reported. The Touchscreen kiosk will help customers make the purchase.   Shoppers will be able to apply for financing through Ally and also shop for insurance. The system placed at the kiosk will then connect them to a dealership within 15 miles of Walmart. The scope of the program can be determined by the fact that 90 percent of U.S. consumers live within 15 miles of a Walmart store, and 140 million of them visit a store each week. "The right location is very valuable. You want to make sure it's convenient for your customers," AutoNation Chief Marketing Officer Marc Cannon told Auto News on Monday. “It's not just the sale. We want to keep them as a customer and continue to develop the service part of our business.” Related Stories Walmart Slashes Christmas Eve Hours The Best Christmas Sales So, while you might not be picking up a car the way you make your regular purchases at Walmart, you will be able to select, finance and insure a vehicle inside a Walmart store and schedule an appointment at the nearest dealership for the rest. CarSaver and Walmart ran a pilot program with 20 participating dealerships in Stuart, Florida, in April 2016. "It is not uncommon for us to test different customer offerings in our stores using our leased spaces," Walmart spokeswoman Molly Blakeman said. CarSaver CEO Sean Wolfington reportedly said that over half of the appointments made via the program generated a sale, and customers, on an average, saved $3,000 as the program offers upfront pricing with no scope for haggling.

Mike Wehner BGR NewsJanuary 25, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share You can already buy just about anything you need at Walmart, and now the mega retailer is going to start selling something you probably never expected: cars. Yep, the country’s biggest store chain will provide car-buying services at 25 of its largest stores in Texas, Arizona, and Oklahoma, allowing you to walk into the store for a gallon of milk and walk out with a new gas-guzzling SUV. Isn’t America wonderful?  Don't Miss: T-Mobile employees share horror stories of lies and bill cramming in ‘wild outlaw’ stores As Automotive News reports, selected Walmart stores won’t actually be operating themselves as dealerships, however, but will instead partner with dealership groups to provide access to car-buying terminals within its stores. Much like Walmart provides spaces for banks, credit unions, fast food chains and even doctors to operate within its stores, the auto sales will be conducted from a small shop in the front of the store. Customers will be able to purchase cars via CarSaver, a digital platform which utilizes touchscreen kiosks so shoppers can browse a selection of new and used vehicles and even get approved for financing and insurance right from within the Walmart. It sounds like a slick little system, but here’s the catch: the cars aren’t actually at Walmart at all. Customers can’t test drive them or kick the tires at the store, but instead have to travel to the actual car dealership that has the car they wanted. If a customer actually follows through and purchases the vehicle, CarSaver gets a “success fee” of $350 or thereabouts. I don’t know about you, but I’ve never tried to get approved for an auto loan before even sitting in the car I wanted to buy, but hey, it’s Walmart after all.

Despite a report that Wal-Mart is involved in an expanded car-sales program in its stores around the country, the retail giant is saying no such plans are in the works. Automotive News reported this week that after participating in a pilot program in Florida with online car seller CarSaver and several dealerships, the service would soon be available in Wal-Mart stores in North Texas in addition to Houston, Phoenix and Oklahoma City. A Wal-Mart Stores Inc. spokesperson said Tuesday that although Car Saver is a tenant in a Stuart, Fla., store, the company as yet has no plans to expand beyond that location. The Automotive News story said CarSaver is partnering with dealers in Texas, Oklahoma and Arizona to begin selling vehicles at various Wal-Mart Supercenters in the four markets on April 1.  The program, according to the publication, would allow buyers to use CarSaver's digital platform at centers placed inside the stores to choose, finance and insure new or used cars.

To start out the new year, we want to take the time to circle back to two of our previous long ideas on some of the giants in the retail industry: Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT) and Target Corporation (TGT). We recommended both of these companies to investors in 2015. So far, both picks have underperformed. WMT is up 1% since our call, vs. 14% for the S&P 500. TGT has dropped by 11% while the S&P is up 6%. Both stocks still look sound, while earning our Attractive rating. Since these are two of the largest retailers in America, and direct competitors, it seems fair to ask: which is the better stock for investors in 2017? In this article, we will judge Wal-Mart and Target on five key categories: Profitability Valuation Cash Flow Yield Corporate Governance Growth Opportunities Two stocks enter. One stock leaves. Who will emerge the champion in this faceoff of retail giants? Wal-Mart vs Target  – Profitability From 1998 to 2015, Wal-Mart dominated this category. The company earned a superior return on invested capital (ROIC) in every single year over that time frame. Per Figure 1, however, that dominance evaporated last year. Figure 1: Wal-Mart Vs. Target ROIC: 1998-Current Sources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings. Target’s ROIC has surged in the past few years as it has sold off unprofitable business lines and refocused on its core competencies. Wal-Mart’s ROIC has gone in the opposite direction as it has overpaid for acquisitions and seen its already thin margins further squeezed by rising labor costs. The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017: The Experts’ Picks Though Wal-Mart’s profitability dominated Target for most of the last twenty years, we’ve seen Target make some big improvements while Wal-Mart has faltered. Right now, Target is the more profitable company, and we expect that edge to last. Scoreboard: Target 1, Wal-Mart 0 WMT and TGT Stock Valuations Both of these stocks are cheap. A variety of factors, from low growth potential, to the evergreen fears over Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN), have weighed on their stock prices. WMT was up 13% in 2016, while TGT was flat, but both stocks are still quite cheap based on their current profits. Both stocks have a price to economic book value ratio (PEBV) of just 0.6. This ratio means the market expects a permanent 40% decline in after-tax operating profit (NOPAT) for both companies. While it’s certainly fair to be wary of the risks facing traditional retailers, such a pessimistic outlook seems unwarranted. Both Wal-Mart and Target are appealingly cheap, which makes this round a push. Scoreboard: Target 1.5, Wal-Mart 0.5 Let’s continue to evaluate these two giants… Next Page   1 2 View All View All   Article printed from InvestorPlace Media, http://investorplace.com/2017/01/wal-mart-vs-target-stock-faceoff-giants-of-retail/. ©2017 InvestorPlace Media, LLC More on InvestorPlace 10 Stocks to Buy That Already Make America Great 7 Awful Stocks You Need to Ditch Now 3 'Golden' Ammo Stocks for Big Returns 3 Healthcare Stocks to Buy Despite Trump 3 Retail Stocks That Are Getting Smashed Apple's iPhone Takes a Hit From … Netflix?

Terroristic Threats at College Park On 1/10/2017 at 1:30pm, Montgomery County Sheriffs Deputies responded to Walmart located at 3040 College Park in reference to a bomb threat. Montgomery County Communications advised that a witness was on location in the parking lot and there was a male (suspect) near a green van talking about turning his van into a bomb and driving it into #1 Criminal Justice Drive (The Montgomery County Sheriffs Office Headquarters). The witness also stated there were numerous other remarks made about making bombs and mustard gas during their conversation. Deputies and officers from assisting agencies arrived and began setting up a perimeter around the parking lot. The suspect was located, bent over inside the rear engine compartment of his 1970s model Volkswagen van. There were several Walmart employees standing within a few feet of him along with a mounted Alpha & Omega mounted security officer. Due to the potentially deadly circumstances, deputies snuck up behind the suspect and safely detained him. The suspect was identified as Danyal Arafat and is known to local law enforcement due to multiple encounters regarding his diminished mental state. The witness was interviewed and stated he was walking into Walmart and stopped to talk to Mr. Arafat about his van. The witness stated that Mr. Arafat abruptly handed him a baggie of money and asked him to go inside and purchase shotgun shells and model rocket motors so that he, Mr. Arafat, could finish making a bomb to blow up the Sheriffs Office. The witness refused to help and continued conversations with Mr. Arafat while he contacted MCSO dispatch for law enforcement assistance. Deputies deployed an explosive K-9 to thoroughly search the Mr. Arafats van for any bomb making our explosive materials and found none. Due to the seriousness of the nature of Mr. Arafats threats and his solicitation for help in constructing an explosive device, he was taken into custody for Felony Terroristic Threat. Sheriff Henderson wishes to extend his gratitude to the witness who did the right thing by immediately contacting the Sheriffs Office for help. While it was proven that Mr. Arafat, fortunately, did not pose an immediate danger to the public or law enforcement, we can never be too careful.

Timothy Green (TMFBargainBin) Jan 26, 2017 at 6:56PM Image source: Wal-Mart. What happened Shares of retail behemoth Wal-Mart Stores (NYSE:WMT) jumped 12.75% in 2016, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence. There was no single piece of news that drove the gains, which all occurred in the first seven months of the year. Instead, steady comparable-sales growth in the United States and new online initiatives likely drove investors to buy the stock. So what Wal-Mart followed through on its plan to raise wages and improve training in February. The moves knocked down Wal-Mart's profit, but the company expects improved efficiency, employee morale, and customer satisfaction to eventually reverse that trend. The focus on making its U.S. stores more appealing to shoppers paid off in 2016. The third quarter marked the ninth consecutive quarter of comparable-sales growth, with much of the growth driven by increased store traffic. Earnings declined as expected, but investors focused on the solid U.S. results. Wal-Mart's e-commerce business also gained momentum during 2016. Global e-commerce sales rose by just 7% year over year, adjusted for currency during the first quarter, but accelerated to 20.6% growth during the third quarter. Wal-Mart's push into online grocery, allowing its customers to order online and pick up for free at its stores, has helped drive this growth. Wal-Mart also acquired Jet.com in August, but the stock declined from that point on. Now what Shares of Wal-Mart have continued to decline in 2017, as many retailers that have reported results so far have disappointed investors. Wal-Mart stock has slumped about 3.5% year to date, wiping out a portion of last year's gains. Wal-Mart will need to remain aggressive as it grows its e-commerce business to compete with Amazon.com. The acquisition of Jet.com gives the company a brand that should appeal to those wary of shopping at Wal-Mart, and initiatives like the Pickup and Fuel concept stores could help the company maintain and grow its grocery market share. Wal-Mart will report its fourth-quarter results on Feb. 21, with investors expecting continued U.S. comparable-sales growth and double-digit e-commerce gains. If Wal-Mart disappoints like other retailers have, even more of 2016's gains could be erased. Timothy Green has no position in any stocks mentioned.

The Sam’s Club ecommerce operations will soon be under Sam’s Club corporate instead of Wal-Mart’s global e-commerce business partially based San Bruno, Calif. This change follows job cuts at Wal-Mart corporate offices, reorganization of Wal-Mart’s replenishment operations, and management changes at Sam’s Club under incoming CEO John Furner. Furner announced that Jamie Iannone, CEO of SamsClub.com, will also be the executive vice president of membership and technology for Sam’s Club and will begin reporting to him Feb. 1. Furner also created a new chief technology officer role for Sam’s Club which will be led by Hsiao Wang who will report to Iannone. Furner said this means Sam’s Club will have dedicated support for its own technology efforts in clubs and online, while also being able to leverage Wal-Mart resources when necessary. “Wang is a technology expert, starting with the company nearly 15 years ago as an enterprise architect, and has since worked within infrastructure, security and development. He also served as the chief information officer for Walmart China before transitioning to his most recent role as vice president of analytics and decision platforms for Wal-Mart Technology,” Furner noted in the memo. Furner worked with Wang during his assignment in China between 2013 and 2015 as the chief merchandising and marketing officer for Walmart China. Furner said SamsClub.com was significant to the company’s overall growth last year and the omnichannel efforts are being recognized across the industry for innovations like the Scan & Go app which allows members to completely omit the checkout line. Furner also announced Kelly Thompson has been promoted to senior vice president and chief operating officer for SamsClub.com. Thompson has 10 years with the company, most recently leading the global category development team. Prior to that she spent seven years as chief merchant for Walmart.com where she managed all merchandising, pricing and planning areas of the business. Thompson will report to Ianonne. Her new SamsClub.com team includes: Alain Nzigamasabo, vice president of merchandising; Adrian Fung, vice president of marketing; and Jim Oliver, vice president of Business Intelligence. Iannone, Wang, Thompson and her team will be based in San Bruno, but answer to Furner in Bentonville. Membership and marketing will also fall under Iannone’s new job description, in addition to managing a team in San Bruno, he will also manage a small team in Bentonville which includes: Eddie Garcia, vice president of product and member experience;. Darshan Gad, vice president of member engines, digital innovation; Matt Martin, vice president of member decision services; and Taylor Duersch, vice president of member and data strategy. Tracey Brown, who previously led the membership division, is transitioning to the new role of senior vice president of operations and customer experience. Brown will report to Furner who said she will be tasked with helping to transform the way members shop clubs, while also simplifying the shopping experience.

Then he was asked which scents he didn’t like: “Well, there are things you don’t want to mention,” he said. “Sometimes I smell things on people that are just terrible—things that make you not like them.” Last Friday, the day that Trump became President of the United States, I marked his ascension by wearing a perfume that seemed, to me, more fitting than Success. Apocalypse, an olfactory index of every element in the Book of Revelation that could conceivably have a smell, was loaned to me by the London gallery of the conceptual artists Thomson & Craighead, who produced fifty bottles last year with the help of the Edinburgh perfumer Euan McCall. Among the twenty or so elements, which are conjured with a mixture of nearly a hundred synthetic compounds and natural oils, were “a rod of iron,” “the smoke of the earth,” “a grievous sore,” “flesh burned with fire,” “the wine of her fornication,” and “a lake which burneth with fire and brimstone.” Since last October, when Hillary Clinton declared that “I’m the last thing standing between you and the apocalypse,” the end-timers have been out in force. Nostradamus is said to have predicted Trump’s rise with talk of “the false trumpet concealing madness”; Bible-prophecy experts like Erika Grey, the author of such books as “The Antichrist of Revelation: 666,” are waxing eschatological on Christian talk radio; and the “Broad City” girls are panicked that “it is about to get ‘I Am Legend’ up in here.” Whether we welcome the Second Coming or not, there’s a reason for our obsession with apocalypse in times of terror: the quick singe is always preferable to the slow burn. On Saturday, still bug-eyed from Trump’s talk of “American carnage,” I opened the black Apocalypse box, emblazoned with a Gothic-looking “A.” The bottle was entombed in black velvet. Through the clear glass, the liquid looked both precious and vile—like Bordeaux, but murkier. I sprayed my wrist, inhaled deeply, and, I kid you not, got a nosebleed. After I recovered, I resumed sniffing, gingerly, and got the general impression of sweetness gone rogue. It was as though a cinnamon cookie had been sautéed in balsamic vinegar. The next night, at dinner, a friend pronounced the scent “not that bad.” She added, “It smells like you’re in line at the Abercrombie store, waiting to buy another bottle of the cologne you’re already wearing.” What of the burning flesh? When I asked McCall, the perfumer, why I hadn’t smelled “every living soul died in the sea,” he told me that I had, in the jasmine oil: “A lot of the compounds you find in the smell of decaying flesh you also find in white flowers,” he explained. Costus, a type of thistle, provided the rooty, leathery notes—and also, McCall said, “the smell of unwashed hair.” And the grievous sore? McCall told me about civet, a musk material from the civet cat, which was part of the original formula for Chanel No. 5; it’s now produced synthetically. “It has a fecal smell in large quantities,” he said. “In small doses, it’s sweet.” With time, the perfume seems to grow even sweeter—another thing it has in common with putrefying bodies, it turns out. Alison Craighead, one half of the artist duo, told me that commercial perfumers spend most of their money on the high notes, “which disappear quickly. We spent a lot of time in the lower notes, which last on your skin a lot longer. You should be able to smell it twelve hours later.” Jon Thomson, the other half, described his experience of wearing the perfume: “It starts hot, like incense; then it gets bloody, with iron notes and some leather.” The scent’s materials are apportioned according to a simple formula: the percentage of “blood” versus “flesh,” for instance, is determined by the number of times each is mentioned in the Book of Revelation. “We were trying to be as literal as possible,” McCall said. The project was inspired by a visit to London’s Victoria and Albert Museum, where Craighead happened on a fourteenth-century altarpiece from Hamburg with forty-five colorfully gruesome scenes. “It’s laid out like a cartoon,” she said, “and I couldn’t quite believe some of the images—the walking dead, the Earth opening up, things shooting out of the sky.” When I asked Thomson if we were living through an apocalypse, he mentioned climate change, income inequality, and Brexit, in addition to our new American regime: “Perhaps this ‘post-truth’ climate harks back to a more medieval mind-set, when everyone in Europe believed that the end of the world was actually taking place around them.” On Friday, the Apocalypse scent will suffuse the room at Young Projects Gallery, in Los Angeles, for the opening of a new Thomson & Craighead show, spanning sound and video work. The title: “Wake Me Up When It’s All Over.” By now, we know that the Trump apocalypse is happening step by step, rather than at once. That’s by design, as Steve Bannon told the Hollywood Reporter after the election: “Darkness is good. Dick Cheney. Darth Vader. Satan. That’s power. It only helps us when they”—liberals—“get it wrong. When they’re blind to who we are and what we’re doing.” When the White House floats two names for the Supreme Court vacancy—Neil M. Gorsuch, an originalist who is nonetheless erudite and circumspect, and William H. Pryor, Jr., who not so long ago argued that anti-sodomy laws were constitutional—there’s no reason for wishful thinking, for imagining that things are mellowing out when in fact they are rotting through. As Thomson told me of the Apocalypse scent, “The cloying sweetness is what sticks in my nostrils. That is where the bile and dread hide in plain sight.” Daniel Wenger is a member of The New Yorker’s editorial staff.

U.S. online seller Amazon said it will increase its investment in Joyo.com, one of China's leading online shopping websites. Loss-making Joyo has been growing fast since Amazon bought the Chinese company for 75 million USD in 2004.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    When the president speaks of closed factories scattered like "tombstones" across America, has he noticed the shuttered stores in shopping centers, and entire malls reduced to rubble? He promises "protection" to prevent foreigners from "destroying" manufacturing jobs by exporting to America things that Americans want to import. Does he know that one American company might be "destroying" more American jobs than China is? And that this supposed destruction is beneficial? The company is Amazon (market capitalization: $388 billion), created by Jeff Bezos. He owns The Washington Post, which syndicates this column, but it is for revolutionizing retailing that he ranks in the Pantheon of American business. He belongs there with Richard Warren Sears, Alvah Curtis Roebuck, Aaron Montgomery Ward and Sam Walton, all of whom were constructively disruptive retailers, and were as important in the nation's commercial history as were Henry Ford, Steve Jobs and Bill Gates. In 2016, online buying during the holiday season surged 19 percent over the year before, which is one factor explaining this: Macy's, after announcing in August that it would close another 100 of its remaining 730 stores, now says it will shed 10,000 jobs. Sears, which is 13 decades old and still has 1,600 stores, has lost $9 billion in five years, has closed 500 stores and is closing another 150 (including some Kmarts). Sears stores in American downtowns, and the Sears catalogue that put downtown goods within reach of rural America (3 million catalogues were distributed in 1907, when the nation's population was 87 million), caused difficulties for older retailers. In the second half of the 20th century, Wal-Marts at the edge of towns caused difficulties for downtown retailers with pre-modern — meaning pre-Wal-Mart — global supply chains. Now Amazon is forcing Wal-Mart to master online retailing. Although e-commerce was just 8 percent of all 2016 retail sales, it came disproportionately at the expense of Sears, Macy's and other "anchor tenants" that draw foot traffic from which other mall retailers benefit. When Amazon recently announced that it is going to create 100,000 warehousing and other jobs in the next 18 months, The New York Times reported that online retailing "has destroyed many times that number of positions at malls and shopping centers across America." The Times quoted specialists' calculations that traditional retailers have shed more than 200,000 employees since 2012, and that there are 1.2 million fewer retail workers than there would be if there were no online retailers. But Henry Ford, too, "destroyed" lots of jobs — those of blacksmiths, buggy makers, etc. — the holders of which moved on, and usually up. Writing at MarketWatch, Rex Nutting argues that as Amazon revolutionizes consumer behavior, it "is going to destroy more American jobs than China ever did." If so, the "problem" is productivity. Nutting says "Amazon needs about half as many workers to sell $100 worth of merchandise as Macy's does." The Times reports that "the typical online retailer generates $1,267,000 in sales per employee versus $279,000 at bricks-and-mortar stores. All of which raises a question: Why should manufacturing jobs lost to foreign competition be privileged by protectionist policies in ways that jobs lost to domestic competition are not? When an Applebee's or Olive Garden, powered by a national advertising budget, opens next to, and causes the closing of, Madge's Diner, why does Madge not merit protection? Or the Trade Adjustment Assistance that is available for workers, firms, farmers, even communities that can plausibly claim to have been otherwise injured by foreign competition or outsourcing of jobs? The reason is this: Domestic protection of Madge and millions of others unsettled by the constant churning of a dynamic domestic economy would mean slow economic growth — and rapid growth of government as it regulates consumers' choices and their consequences. But protection from imports also means this. Reactionary liberalism has long held, and today's faux conservatism agrees, that existing jobs should be protected by policies that reduce the economic dynamism that threatens those jobs. Such protection means a net decrease in jobs but an increase in the self-esteem of blinkered protectionists who see the jobs "saved" but not those which, as a result of lost dynamism, are lost or never created. Macy's flagship Manhattan store was one reason Gimbels' nearby flagship closed, after 76 years, in 1986. This, even though in 1945 Gimbels had been America's first merchant to offer "a fantastic, atomic era, miraculous pen." It was a ballpoint. Will the winner of the once-famous Macy's versus Gimbels rivalry always be with us? Probably not, which is probably good. George F.

To make sense of all of this information, and put it to work solving problems, the company has created what it calls its Data Café – a state-of-the-art analytics hub located within its Bentonville, Arkansas headquarters. Here, over 200 streams of internal and external data, including 40 petabytes of recent transactional data, can be modelled, manipulated and visualized. Teams from any part of the business are invited to bring their problems to the analytics experts and then see a solution appear before their eyes on the nerve centre’s touch screen “smart boards”.

Target will launch its own mobile payments system this year Posted Jan 24, 2017 by Sarah Perez (@sarahintampa) 0 SHARES Next Story Ford hires Apple, Nike and Burberry alum to lead global branding efforts Target’s CartWheel application has grown to some 27 million shoppers who have used it over the past three years following its debut to save over $600 million at checkout. Now, the retailer hints it may be adding mobile payments to the app, and potentially its main Target application, as well. The company didn’t confirm which of the two, or if both, would be updated to include mobile payments functionality, only that it was planned for this year. However, it makes sense that Cartwheel would be updated with this feature. The app already offers consumers a barcode they display at checkout to save on their purchases, among other features. It’s basically a modern-day alternative to clipping coupons as users add selected savings to their list, then receive those discounts via the barcode scan. Adding the ability to also transact with a barcode scan seems to follow. The news was first reported by Recode, who spoke with Chief Information and Digital Officer Michael McNamara at the National Retail Federation conference in New York. (Target confirmed the report as accurate.) The retailer said that it would “at least initially” make its mobile payments service available to Target REDcard holders – a comment that doesn’t seem to rule out broadening its scope in the future. This would make Target the third major big box store to launch its own mobile payments system. Walmart introduced its own Walmart Pay at the end of 2015 and Kohl’s more recently debuted Kohl’s Pay, along with its own loyalty and rewards program, into its mobile app. But Target has an advantage in making its mobile payments platform work where others failed – including CurrentC, the payments system a consortium of retailers (including Target and Walmart) once backed. Meanwhile, Target’s CartWheel app is already popular with mainstream consumers, easily maintaining its top 10 status in the App Store’s “Shopping” category, for example. And according to a 2016 report, CartWheel isn’t just a popular download, it keeps people engaged, too. As of early last year, it had a reported 13 million-plus active user base. “CartWheel is Target’s mobile advantage over most other retailers. It gives Target a much larger and more frequent mobile application user base than almost any other retailer,”  Jason Goldberg, SVP of commerce and content at digital marketing agency Razorfish, previously noted. In other words, retailers in general may be fumbling with their mobile initiatives, but Target is something of an outlier in terms of real-world adoption and usage. That being said, REDcard holders only make up a portion of the app’s user base. That would make Target’s foray into mobile payments something that’s more of a perk for cardholders than a feature that would be universally adopted, unless Target chooses to expand this feature to be more inclusive. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Cartwheel App Description Target savings, mobile style Website http://cartwheel.target.com/ Full profile for Cartwheel App Target Founded 1962 Overview Expect the Best.

Straight Talk offers cheap monthly plans with plenty of minutes, texting and 4G LTE data. It is a very attractive option for users who want the new iPhone 6 or iPhone 6 Plus but need a lower monthly bill. Advertisement With the Straight Talk iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus buyers pay the full price for the new iPhone, but the cheaper monthly plan prices still lead to savings over traditional carriers. A Straight Talk iPhone 6 sounds like a great deal, but there are things that buyers need to know before signing up and paying $650 for a new iPhone. You can bring your current iPhone to Straight Talk, or you can now buy a Straight Talk iPhone 6 direct from the carrier or at Walmart. What you need to know about the Straight Talk iPhone 6 before you buy. Advertisement A Straight Talk iPhone plan starts at $45 a month and $60 a month for international calling. For the lower price there are some trade-offs that you need to be aware of before you buy the Straight Talk iPhone 6. Advertisement This is a pre-paid carrier, but you can set up an auto-pay plan so you aren’t always entering in codes and remembering a monthly payment. You’ll need to compare a variety of plans to make sure you are getting a deal, but for the same $45 a month you get vastly less data and need to pay for the phone each month on Verizon or $60 a month for just 1GB of data. Here are 7 facts buyers need to know about the Straight Talk iPhone 6 before buying the new iPhone on this popular pre-paid carrier. Straight Talk iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus The great news is that you can buy a Straight Talk iPhone 6 or Straight Talk iPhone 6 Plus. Normally we see some limitations on other carriers, but Apple is letting anyone get in on the iPhone 6 Plus demand. All of these details apply to both of the new iPhones. Advertisement Read: iPhone 6 Plus Review The Straight Talk iPhone 6 features a 4.7-inch display and the iPhone 6 Plus a 5.5-inch display. The iPhone 6 Plus features a higher resolution 1080P display and a camera with optical image stabilization. Both new iPhones use an Apple A8 processor, come with many sensors and an all metal design. 16GB Only, But All Color Options There is no 64GB Straight Talk iPhone 6 available. Like Walmart, the Straight Talk iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus are only available with the lowest amount of storage. Although a 16GB iPhone 6 is enough for some users, there are good reasons not to buy the 16GB iPhone 6. Straight Talk offers all colors, but only 16GB options. On the upside, you can buy the Straight Talk iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus in all three colors. This includes gold, solver and space gray. Here’s help deciding which iPhone 6 color to buy. Advertisement 4G LTE Data for the Straight Talk iPhone 6 Straight Talk started offering 4G LTE data last year, which means consumers can enjoy the same speeds as on major carriers. This is key to a good iPhone 6 experience, since many apps and services assume you are using a fast connection. Watch the iPhone 6 speed test in the video below. Same Network as Major Carriers As the iPhone 6 speed test video shows, 4G LTE speeds and coverage vary between carriers. The good news about the Straight Talk iPhone 6 is that it connects to the same networks as the big names in wireless. Straight Talk does not list the specific networks but it is very likely that the Straight Talk iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus purchased from Walmart will run on AT&T. There is a chance it will run on Verizon, but it is less likely. Here’s a look at Straight Talk coverage. Advertisement Unlimited Data With a Catch When you look at the Straight Talk iPhone 6 plans you’ll see unlimited data listed, but it isn’t unlimited. Despite the need for an asterisk, Straight Talk is more up front than in earlier years. You aren’t cut off after a set amount, but your data is slowed down after you use 3GB of high-speed data in a 30 day period. You’ll still connect, but it will likely be at slower 3G speeds. At the end of the 30 day period you’ll get your high-speed data back. Straight Talk still reserves the right to cancel your line if you use too much data, but the new terms better explain limits and use. Customer Support isn’t Up to Big Names The last time Gotta Be Mobile used Straight Talk and needed support, we ended up bounced between Straight Talk and Tracfone with no real resolution to our problem. Friends and family who switched to Straight Talk and brought their own iPhones found little help when data connectivity failed, despite a simple software solution. You may receive good support, but there is not the same store and support agent availability as with the bigger carriers, so keep that in mind. No Tethering There is no support for tethering or personal hotspots with Straight Talk. That means you can’t use the new Instant Hotspot between your Straight Talk iPhone 6 and Mac running OS X Yosemite. No hotspot or tethering options on the Straight Talk iPhone 6. In fact you can’t use any type of hotspot or Internet Sharing. It is not included in any plans and if you are eventually able to use an iPhone 6 jailbreak to do this, you risk cancellation by Straight Talk. 22 Responses 10/30/2014 Alex Reply What’s wrong with this picture? 10/30/2014 Randal Reply Check out this line of iPhone compatible projectors, display your pictures, iTunes content, and any other apps while on the go with one of these PICO projectors. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjECbaLd_ac&list=UUAgQDzRklgm9Ku7EVkqBbHA https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upe6CzwbhNc 11/16/2014 Amina Reply Is there a trade in option with straight talk?

There are 31 days in July, which means your buddy’s mother-in-law would have worked $21480/$63=341hrs, or 341/31=11hrs/day. 11*7=77hrs/wk. I mean, if I was making $63/hr, I’d probably be working 77hrs/wk too, because I’d be making $258k but I don’t think that 77hrs/wk is classified as “a few hours”. 10/20/2015 D Reply Straight Talk customer service is worse than horrible 11/27/2015 J Reply Why do you need customer service? 12/07/2015 A Reply I bought the iPhone 6s and have had a horrible month of the internet working when it wants to 12/18/2015 Stacy Snider Reply I paid a lot for the 5c iPhone in March & half the time or more the Internet doesn’t work, if I hadn’t spent so much for the phone I wouldn’t be as upset as I am.

Check out the best travel deals and destinations Political Pulse Your political and regional news source News Politics Central Florida Political Pulse 'Liquor wall' bill clears 1st committee Tallahassee Orlando Sentinel file Orlando Sentinel file News Service of Florida Privacy Policy TALLAHASSEE —  A measure that would allow Floridians to mix vodka and veggies in their shopping carts -- something prohibited for more than eight decades --- sailed through a Senate committee on Thursday. The Regulated Industries Committee, in a 9-1 vote, backed the latest proposal (SB 106) to repeal a Depression-era law requiring liquor stores and bars to be separated from groceries and other retail goods, commonly referred to as the "liquor wall." The measure could be a boon to some "big box" retailers. Meanwhile, lawmakers are looking to exclude some small gas stations and neighborhood convenience stores if the proposal becomes law. The proposal, which has failed to advance in past sessions, pits retailers Wal-Mart and Target, both in favor of the repeal, against Lakeland-based shopping giant Publix and ABC Fine Wine & Spirits. Sen. Audrey Gibson, D-Jacksonville, said she doesn't see the proposed change causing small independent liquor stores to go out of business, as they would continue to attract "niche" customers. "It's a whole different demographic," Gibson said in voting for the proposal. "I go to (an) ABC (in Jacksonville). There is a Wal-Mart I can take the next exit to go to that has a (separate) liquor store there, but I go to that ABC because they have certain brands that I don't believe that a Wal-Mart will ever have." Sen. Keith Perry, a Gainesville Republican who cast the lone vote against the measure, said after the meeting he's open to revisions in the bill but for now has concerns about access to alcohol by minors. "I have teenage daughters, and I have a sophomore in college, and access now is pretty available, whether in bar or places," Perry said. "It's not the competitiveness that I'm concerned about. I think we should have less barriers for business." The proposal is intended by its sponsor, Miami Republican Anitere Flores, to give shoppers more convenience. The bill would allow hard spirits such as whiskey and rum to be sold alongside beer, wine and groceries in traditional supermarkets and other stores that sell groceries. The measure would also allow liquor stores to expand their grocery options. Jason Unger, a lobbyist for Target, said the change would "enable us to meet our customers' demands." Publix views stand-alone liquor stores directly adjacent to its regular stores as a business model. Scott Dick, a lobbyist for the Florida Independent Spirits Association, said the change would give the big-box operators an unfair competitive advantage over small liquor-store owners. "We operate under a level playing field today," Dick said. Charles Bailes, CEO of ABC Fine Wine & Spirits, argued big-box stores have been able to compete under the existing law and that there hasn't been a public outcry for the repeal. He also said the change would make liquor more accessible for minors to steal.

Democrat and Chronicle Published 2:15 p.m. ET Jan. 26, 2017 | Updated 4:08 p.m. ET Jan. 26, 2017 CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share Federal law enforcement talk about the sentencing of ISIL sympathizer Emanuel Lutchman and Lutchman's courtroom outburst after Lutchman's sentencing. Tina MacIntyre-Yee Emanuel Lutchman, who pleaded guilty in August 2016 to conspiracy to provide material support to a foreign terrorism organization, was sentenced Thursday, Jan. 26, 2017, to 20 years in prison. He was accused of planning a terror attack in Rochester on New Year's Eve 2015. (Photo: Carlos Ortiz, Rochester (N.Y.) Democrat and Chronicle) ROCHESTER, N.Y. — Before he planned to attack patrons at a New York bar in an Islamic State-inspired crime, Emanuel Lutchman had another plot: He would kill his wife. The FBI had not planned to arrest Lutchman on Dec. 30, 2015, when it did — a day before Lutchman intended to wield a machete and attack New Year's Eve patrons at a Rochester, N.Y., bar. But agents learned Lutchman had told an FBI informant that he wanted to kill his wife — Lutchman had earlier been convicted of menacing her — and agents believed they had to intervene for the woman's safety. "We were getting worried that he was taking serious steps" to find his wife, FBI Special Agent Joseph Testani said Thursday, after Lutchman was sentenced to 20 years for conspiring to assist the terrorist organization, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, also known as ISIL or ISIS. USA TODAY Man pleads guilty in plot to attack New York bar On Thursday, U.S.District Judge Frank Geraci Jr. sentenced Lutchman, 26, to the maximum sentence of 20 years. Only moments before, Lutchman had tearfully apologized to the court and his family. He said he had renounced ISIL and its plans to violently establish a caliphate in the Middle East. But once Geraci imposed the sentence, Lutchman turned angry and defiant. "You think because I'm going to be incarcerated there aren't going to be more of us that rise up," Lutchman said, his voice rising. Geraci responded calmly, saying that Lutchman apparently still adhered to ISIL's tenets, despite his assertions to the contrary. "Yes I do," Lutchman answered. "… There's going to be more of us." For prosecutors and police, the outburst was evidence of Lutchman's danger. A man who has struggled with mental illness for much of his life, Lutchman has been portrayed by family and supporters as a fragile individual who was hand-held into the terrorist plot by an FBI informant. But Lutchman's anger, which included shouts and rants in Arabic, were proof of his "true colors," said assistant U.S. Attorney Brett Harvey, the prosecutor in the case. At Lutchman's sentencing Thursday, Harvey detailed how Lutchman had initiated contact with a Syria-based ISIL recruiter, who directed Lutchman to commit a crime on U.S. soil. USA TODAY N.Y. terror suspect pledged allegiance to Islamic State A felon who'd been imprisoned for robbery, Lutchman could not buy a gun. So he decided to attack the patrons at Merchants Grill in Rochester with a machete and knives, and possibly take some hostages, authorities say. "He's a zealous and ardent supporter of the Islamic State," Harvey said. “You think because I'm going to be incarcerated there aren't going to be more of us that rise up.”Emanuel Lutchman Lutchman recorded a video in which he told of his planned New Year's Eve assault. He'd been told to create the video by the recruiter for ISIL, and the Islamic State aimed to use it for propaganda, Harvey said. At sentencing, Lutchman's attorney,  Steven Slawinski, an assistant federal public defender, highlighted Lutchman's mental health problems, including bipolar disorder, depression and suicidal ideations. Lutchman, who often panhandled in the same neighborhood as the Merchants Grill, was so destitute that the FBI informant accompanied him to Walmart on Dec. 29, 2015, and spent $40 to buy the machete, knives and zip ties that Lutchman intended to use in his attack. "The risk of danger here is exaggerated by the government," said Slawinski, who had argued in court papers for a 10-year sentence for Lutchman. Lutchman's anger toward his wife was not mentioned in court, or in court papers. But, in an interview after the sentencing, FBI agent Testani said law enforcement arrested him when they did because of Lutchman's comments that he wanted to seek out his wife and kill her. USA TODAY FBI wanted terror suspect as informant, grandma says The wife, who has a 2-year-old son with Lutchman, had an order of protection against him. The FBI and other members of the regional Joint Terrorism Task Force were preparing the legal papers to arrest Lutchman and head off the New Year's Eve plot when they learned that he'd told the informant of his murderous intentions toward his wife.

The informant, who had been working with the FBI, was able to connect with Lutchman. Agents arrested Lutchman in a car with the informant. Lutchman was "intent on doing it ... and irrational," Testani said of Lutchman's desire to kill his wife. Lutchman pleaded guilty in August to providing "material support" to a terrorist organization —  a sweeping law designed to battle terrorism in the United States. USA TODAY N.Y. terrorism cases likely shared same informant In court Thursday, Geraci acknowledged Lutchman's mental struggles, but said that same psychological fragility "also created a real danger in this community." Lutchman's ISIL-motivated video, in which he told how he intended to attack the Merchants Grill, was proof of his seriousness to carry out the crime, Geraci said. "That video ... indicates that this was the real deal," Geraci said. "People were going to die at the Merchants Grill on New Year's Eve, but for the intervention of law enforcement." As U.S. Marshals Service deputies removed Lutchman from court after his eruption, he shouted back at Geraci, "(Expletive) you!" An unfazed Geraci responded, "Motion denied."

The surveillance footage, released by the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office on Wednesday, shows Michael Foster, 43, tackling Clarence Daniels from behind as he was walking into a Brandon, Fla. Wal-Mart on Tuesday. Foster followed Daniels into the store after seeing him exiting his vehicle with a gun holstered under his shirt — which was perfectly legal for the 62-year-old Daniels to do since he holds a concealed weapon license. Nevertheless, Foster tackled Daniels from behind as he entered the store, and put him in a chokehold before taking him to the ground. Witnesses said that Foster yelled out that Daniels had a gun. They also said that Daniels yelled out that he had a license for it. Foster called 911 only after he tackled accosted Daniels. He was arrested and charged with battery.

She reported the incident to Wahpeton Police and days later hasn't heard back. That's when she contacted our Whistleblower Hotline looking for help. Jenny McQuiston is a mother of soon to be eight children. Over the weekend, she went food shopping with her three-year-old daughter. While in Walmart, a man caught their attention and asked the little girl's name. Mom said "Elliana" and continued on. Later after checking out, the mother-daughter pair were in an exit area looking at a Redbox. "And that same man that wanted to know her name came around and picked her up from behind under her arms and he said, 'Got one!'" explains the mother from Wahpeton. McQuiston yelled and the man dropped her daughter saying, "Just joking!" The man left and following the incident McQuiston knew it had to be reported with police and Walmart but was later extremely disappointed with what police told her. "Based on what they saw on surveillance, they don't think that the man was meaning any harm," she says. "For you to arrest anybody, you have to either have a warrant charging them with a crime already or you have to have probable cause that they've committed an offense and right now we're absent of those things," says Scott Thorsteinson. The Wahpeton Police Chief says cases like this are not as easy as you think but they are working alongside Walmart to identify the suspect who is described as being a regular shopper. But for this mother, that is not enough because now her concern isn't just for her children but for her entire community. "You know if he had pulled a gun on somebody and when he was caught backed up and said, 'Just joking!' would he still be out there just wondering around?" adds McQuiston. Wahpeton Police recommends never giving your child's name out to strangers in public, always have your children close by you and to never leave them unattended. The Police Chief also invites McQuiston to contact the department if she has any concerns as they continue getting to the bottom of this. Chief Thorsteinson did not give us a description of the suspect, but according to McQuiston, the suspect is a white male in his 40s with red hair and some facial hair who was wearing a Harley Davidson black sweater jacket with a black leather hat.

According to the criminal complaint, Dominick Garretson, 37, was taken into custody Tuesday at the North Atherton Street Wal-Mart after attempting to leave the store with about $575 in merchandise. Garretson reportedly said he received an email asking him to be a “secret shopper,” seeking out loss-prevention workers and establishing flaws in the loss-prevention system. Garretson was also found with a small jar of white powder that field-tested positive for amphetamine, police said. It was sent to a lab for further testing. Garretson was charged with a felony count of retail theft and misdemeanor charges of receiving stolen property and possession of a controlled substance. Bail was set at $2,500.

Marc Lore, Wal-Mart's new U.S. e-commerce chief executive officer, informed employees of the job cuts in an internal memo. He said the Bentonville-based retailer is "focused on adding the right talent to our team and making sure we're investing in ways that directly improve our customer experience." "As difficult as this decision is, I know it's the right one," Lore said in the memo. The cuts are part of Wal-Mart's strategy to eliminate nearly 1,000 corporate-level positions before Tuesday, the end of its fiscal year. Multiple sources said employees in the company's replenishment department were among those affected by a round of layoffs in Northwest Arkansas on Friday. The decision to eliminate positions in California is not a sign Wal-Mart will slow investments in e-commerce. Instead, Lore pointed to comments from Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon in another internal memo last week that indicated the retailer would have to make changes on the inside so customers can experience the benefits on the outside. E-commerce resources are expected to shift to other areas within the division. "While some roles are going away today, we'll be investing in our business and adding new skillsets during the year," Lore said in the internal memo. Economists said earlier this month that it's not unusual for a company of Wal-Mart's size to eliminate workers and hire others at the same time as it restructures operations. Wal-Mart employs more than 1.5 million people in the U.S. [EMAIL UPDATES: Get free breaking news alerts, daily newsletters with top headlines delivered to your inbox] "With any kind of company as big as Wal-Mart, that's going to mean that they occasionally switch strategies and switch the kinds of skills that they need to implement," said Kathy Deck, a University of Arkansas economist and director of the Center for Business and Economic Research. Wal-Mart's e-commerce restructuring began after the company closed its $3.3 billion acquisition of Jet.com last year. Lore, Jet.com's founder, became the head of Wal-Mart's U.S. e-commerce business as part of the acquisition. He announced his e-commerce leadership team earlier this month and the group is a blend of Walmart.com and Jet.com leaders. Lore said in the internal memo that the organization plans to become more "customer-centric" and told employees Tuesday that the retailer had a "clear strategy" moving forward. "We've structured the team for speed and simplicity," Lore said in the memo. "We're building an organization with the right talent and experience. We've created an environment where the best minds across our many locations can team up and drive great ideas forward."

(Reuters photo: Fred Greaves) Share article on Facebookshare Tweet articletweet Plus one article on Google Plus+1 Print Article Adjust font size AA AA AA AA AA AA AA by George Will January 25, 2017 8:00 PM @GeorgeWill Economic development always leads to some job loss to competition that is domestic as well as foreign. When the president speaks of closed factories scattered like “tombstones” across America, has he noticed the shuttered stores in shopping centers, and entire malls reduced to rubble? He promises “protection” to prevent foreigners from “destroying” manufacturing jobs by exporting to America things that Americans want to import. Does he know that one American company might be “destroying” more American jobs than China is? And that this supposed destruction is beneficial? The company is Amazon (market capitalization: $388 billion), created by Jeff Bezos. He owns the Washington Post, which syndicates this column, but it is for revolutionizing retailing that he ranks in the pantheon of American business. He belongs there with Richard Warren Sears, Alvah Curtis Roebuck, Aaron Montgomery Ward, and Sam Walton, all of whom were constructively disruptive retailers, and were as important in the nation’s commercial history as were Henry Ford, Steve Jobs, and Bill Gates. In 2016, online buying during the holiday season surged 19 percent over the year before, which is one factor explaining this: Macy’s, after announcing in August that it would close another 100 of its remaining 730 stores, now says it will shed 10,000 jobs. Sears, which is 13 decades old and still has 1,600 stores, has lost $9 billion in five years, has closed 500 stores, and is closing another 150 (including some Kmarts). Sears stores in American downtowns, and the Sears catalogue that put downtown goods within reach of rural America (3 million catalogues were distributed in 1907, when the nation’s population was 87 million), caused difficulties for older retailers. In the second half of the 20th century, Walmarts at the edge of towns caused difficulties for downtown retailers with pre-modern — meaning pre-Walmart — global supply chains. Now Amazon is forcing Walmart to master online retailing. Although e-commerce was just 8 percent of all 2016 retail sales, it came disproportionately at the expense of Sears, Macy’s, and other “anchor tenants” that draw foot traffic from which other mall retailers benefit. When Amazon recently announced that it is going to create 100,000 warehousing and other jobs in the next 18 months, the New York Times reported that online retailing “has destroyed many times that number of positions at malls and shopping centers across America.” The Times quoted specialists’ calculations that traditional retailers have shed more than 200,000 employees since 2012, and that there are 1.2 million fewer retail workers than there would be if there were no online retailers. But Henry Ford, too, “destroyed” lots of jobs — those of blacksmiths, buggy makers, etc. — the holders of which moved on, and usually up. Writing at MarketWatch, Rex Nutting argues that as Amazon revolutionizes consumer behavior, it “is going to destroy more American jobs than China ever did.” If so, the “problem” is productivity. Nutting says “Amazon needs about half as many workers to sell $100 worth of merchandise as Macy’s does.” The Times reports that “the typical online retailer generates $1,267,000 in sales per employee versus $279,000 at bricks-and-mortar stores. Why should manufacturing jobs lost to foreign competition be privileged by protectionist policies in ways that jobs lost to domestic competition are not? All of which raises a question: Why should manufacturing jobs lost to foreign competition be privileged by protectionist policies in ways that jobs lost to domestic competition are not? When an Applebee’s or Olive Garden, powered by a national advertising budget, opens next to, and causes the closing of, Madge’s Diner, why does Madge not merit protection? Or the Trade Adjustment Assistance that is available for workers, firms, farmers, even communities that can plausibly claim to have been otherwise injured by foreign competition or outsourcing of jobs? The reason is this: Domestic protection of Madge and millions of others unsettled by the constant churning of a dynamic domestic economy would mean slow economic growth — and rapid growth of government as it regulates consumers’ choices and their consequences. But protection from imports also means this. Reactionary liberalism has long held, and today’s faux conservatism agrees, that existing jobs should be protected by policies that reduce the economic dynamism that threatens those jobs. Such protection means a net decrease in jobs but an increase in the self-esteem of blinkered protectionists who see the jobs “saved” but not those that, as a result of lost dynamism, are lost or never created. Macy’s flagship Manhattan store was one reason Gimbels’ nearby flagship closed, after 76 years, in 1986. This, even though in 1945 Gimbels had been America’s first merchant to offer “a fantastic, atomic era, miraculous pen.” It was a ballpoint. Will the winner of the once-famous Macy’s-versus-Gimbels rivalry always be with us? Probably not, which is probably good. — George Will is a Pulitzer Prize–winning syndicated columnist. © 2017 Washington Post Writers Group Load More Photo Essay March for Life About Institute Advertise Contact NR Facebook Twitter Google+ Privacy
W2O Group Hires Amy Lamparske to Strengthen PESO Media, Search Capabilities Across Key Industries Amy Lamparske, W2O Group's Managing Director of Digital Media will strengthen the firm's PESO media and search capabilities across key industries.

Amy Lamparske, W2O Group's Managing Director of Digital Media will strengthen the firm's PESO media and search capabilities across key industries. (Photo: Business Wire) Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail January 26, 2017 08:00 AM Eastern Standard Time SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--W2O Group, a network of complementary communications, marketing and digital firms, announced today that digital marketing strategist Amy Lamparske, formerly of 3M, General Mills and Walmart, has joined to further bolster the organization’s digital media capabilities across paid, earned, shared and owned (PESO) media. Lamparske’s extensive background includes more than 15 years in digital marketing and communications with an array of organizations ranging from startups to Fortune 200 brands. “Amy has a proven track record of implementing global strategic communications plans and activations by leveraging her expertise across interactive marketing, e-commerce, social media and search,” said W2O President Bob Pearson. “She has held leadership roles that provided her with unique exposure to the breadth of digital and social capabilities and programs executed by industry-leading companies. Her extensive experience will be integral in evolving our offerings and facilitating integration within our media teams.” She will be based in the Minneapolis office and partner with Adam Cossman, Chief Digital Officer, and Jeff Rohwer, Managing Director of Digital Strategy and Innovation, to oversee and build a fully integrated digital team across W2O Group’s three operating units. Cossman and Rohwer joined W2O Group late last year as part of its acquisition of Sentient to strengthen its digital offering notably in paid media and search optimization. In 2016, Sentient had significant business in paid media (search, display, online video, etc.), and W2O Group steadily increased its management of paid social media and search on behalf of its healthcare and global brands/technology clients. Pearson added, “We continue to round out our PESO media and search capabilities, and we are projecting a significant increase in digital paid media demand from our clients in 2017. Amy will ensure we’re able to execute programming seamlessly while creating a world-class offering for brands across healthcare, technology, consumer, finance, energy and automotive.” Sentient’s digital media function coupled with W2O’s paid social and search capabilities will function as a solid platform on which the company will continue to build out a robust PESO digital media. This will open up new revenue streams for current W2O clients. The combination of Sentient and W2O also increases the firm’s competitiveness with other digital and media agencies. Further, W2O Group is building its current Search Engine Marketing (SEM) capabilities including paid search campaigns (PPC) and organic search optimization efforts (SEO). The firm is poised to add new search offerings such as “search media relations” to evolve how clients think of search in the context of their broader marketing and communications plans. “W2O Group is truly rewriting the rules and forging new pathways for clients to break through in an extremely complex environment,” said Lamparske. “It’s an innovation hub that has built an ecosystem with talented strategists, analysts, creatives, counselors, technologists and innovative thinkers all working in concert with client leaders to grow their brands and businesses.” For a deeper look into Lamparske’s background and vision, view W2O Group’s Common Sense blog post. About W2O Group Founded and led by CEO Jim Weiss in 2001, W2O Group is an independent, fast-growing network of complementary digitally-oriented marketing and communications firms focused on integrated business solutions to drive change and growth through "pragmatic disruption" for the world's leading brands and organizations.

Tech Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies TV Politics Business Super Bowl Ads     Now The NES Classic Mod Supports Over 800 Games Posted: Jan 27 2017, 3:03am CST | by Luigi Lugmayr, in News | Technology News     The new release of the hakchi2 NES modding tool supports to install over 800 ROMs on the NES Classic Edition console. Updated. The NES Classic Edition mod to install other games than the pre-installed ones has just gotten a lot better. The developer of hakchi2 has released hakchi2 2.11, enabling NES owners to install over 800 games. Don't Miss: Exclusive Video Reports from the CES 2017 Show Floor Updates: Jan. 27: The hakchi2 2.11 version has been updated and is now a full release. Early adopters need to download the new version from GitHub again, as the initial pre-release had issues according to this reddit post. Youtube user DonkeyPuncher1976 has installed over 800 games on his NES Classic using hackchi2 2.11. He says in the video that the mod and installation of the 800 games took him just an hour to do. To install hakchi2 2.11 download the hakchi2.zip from Github. This video by Weyay Studios is doing a good job on explaining how to use hakchi2 tool and install new games on your the NES Classic. The new version comes with lots of new capabilities including folders and pages support. There is now no limit on the number of games that can be installed. The developer tested it with over 600 ROMs. "Everything working fine including save-states. You can select maximum games per page/folder but it's recommended to limit it to 30-35," the developer said in the release notes on GitHub. Other new features include multistep uploading to enable the installation of larger games. Users of hakchi2 can now initial a mass cover download and do not have to uncompress ROMs before installation. The new hakchi2 release is a major update and despite being a pre-release, the first users are ecstatic about it. There is renewed interest in the NES after hackers found a way to add more games to the NES Classic that increases the pressure on the NES supply. New tools make it easy for NES owners to open up the system and install more games. The instructions to hack the NES Classic Edition are available. Several stores have received new NES Classic inventory this week including Walmart and GameStop. Find the latest updates on the NES Classic supply below: NES Classic at GameStop NES Classic at Walmart NES Classic at Target NES Classic at ToysRUs Stores The reseller prices of the NES Classic have come down a bit after the Holidays, but are now increasing again to $150 plus shipping on amazon.com. It is easier to find NES Classic controllers Amazon now, although they are not from Nintendo. The Nyko MiniBoss Wireless Controller for NES Classic Edition in stock at Amazon for $18. The 8Bitdo NES30 Classic Edition Wireless Controller Set with Bluetooth Retro Receiver is also in stock for $39.99. Find all NES Controller on sale at amazon.com. The demand for the NES is still extremely high. Resellers offer the NES on the Amazon marketplace are $150 and up. Nintendo is under criticism for bad demand forecasting since years. Part of it is intentional as shortage generates buzz. The downside are the countless hours of people spent in line and the caused frustration. There is no update from Nintendo when the Japanese video game maker will resolve the shortage. The $59.99 Nintendo NES Classic Edition console launched on November 11 in stores and online. The supply was extremely constraint in stores and especially online. On launch day Nintendo said: "The Nintendo Entertainment System: NES Classic Edition system is a hot item, and we are working hard to keep up with consumer demand. There will be a steady flow of additional systems through the holiday shopping season and into the new year. Please contact your local retailers to check availability." Nintendo did not make any further comments about the NES Classic supply situation since then. Nintendo of America President Reggie Fils-Aime tried to explain last week in an interview why the NES is suffering a shortage.  "When we looked at that proposition what we believed was the adults, 30-40 years old, who grew up playing NES as a kid, 10 years old or so but had stepped away from the gaming category--that was going to be the buyer," Fils-Aime said to GameSpot. "As we thought about that, that led us to a certain level of supply. The reality, however, was that the lapsed gamer and the "more active gamer" bought the NES Classic." This is a poor excuse. Nintendo apparently does not do focus groups ahead of console launches. The palm-sized NES console, retailing for $59.99 list price, features the classic Nintendo NES controller many geeks have grown up with. The retro console comes pre-installed with 30 classic NES games including Super Mario Bros., Pac-Man, Metroid, Donkey Kong, The Legend of Zelda and Kirby's Adventures. The NES Classic Edition system is a miniaturized version of the groundbreaking NES, originally released in 1985. The NES Classic Edition comes only with a single wired controller. There are 3rd party controllers and accessories that make the NES more fun to use. Gamers can get additional controllers and even wireless controllers. The Holiday shopping season 2016 has been dominated by the hunt for Hatchimals and the Nintendo NES classic edition. In a short two months the new Nintendo Switch will go sale and Nintendo fans brace for the worst. The Nintendo Switch pre-order are sold out. The supply situation might no be as bad as for the NES, but it will be difficult to get a Switch at launch for customers who have not pre-ordered the Switch.

Police said someone made 10 unauthorized purchases using a Master Card debit number owned by Michele Linder, Saint Clair. All of the transactions were made at either a Target or Checkers store in Florida, police said. Police said the purchases from the Target store were made over the telephone and that at the time it is not known how the thief or thieves obtained Linder’s credit card information. Anyone with information is asked to call police at 570-874-5300. None injured in 2-car accident Pottsville police investigated a two-car crash that occurred about 10:45 a.m. Tuesday in the 500 block of East Norwegian Street. Police said the investigating officer, Cpl. Charles Webber, learned that Sandra Schwenk, 63, of Auburn, was driving a 2008 Lexus east when she believed an oncoming vehicle was in her lane too far and veered to the right to avoid a collision. In doing so, Webber said, Schwenk swerved too far to the right and struck a legally parked Chrysler 200 owned by a Pottsville man. Both vehicles sustained disabling damage and had to be towed from the scene, Webber reported, adding that no injuries were reported.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obits E-Edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds subscribe Site Archive Harbor Freight, Starbucks, Tractor Supply Co: Planning Commission talks a lot of plans Thursday Jan 26, 2017 at 12:01 AM Jessica Weston City Editor Jessica_Weston9 After a hiatus lasting several months, the Planning Commission was back to business Tuesday. New Planning Commissioner James Sanders was sworn in, alongside returning commissioners Warren Cox, Solomon Rajaratnam and Cecil Yates. The other new Planning Commission appointee, Cameron Bruce, was absent. Former Planning Commissioners since elected to City Council Lindsey Stephens and Warren Cox were also recognized for their service to the commission. The commission again selected Cox as chair and Rajaratnam as vice chair. Committee assignments were also made. According to City Manager Dennis Speer at the council meeting last week, former City Planner Matthew Alexander will be returning as a contractor. Staff reports were presented Tuesday by Economic Develop Manager Gary Parsons, however. On the agenda were site plan presentations or reviews for several upcoming projects. The commission heard a presentation about Harbor Freight Tools (in the old Lindsey's Furniture building), and approved a site plan review for Tractor Supply Co. (to go in to part of the old Walmart building).  They also had a preliminary discussion about a new drive-thru Starbucks (in the old Pizza Hut building). “We do have a lot of public hearings tonight and plans to look at,” Parsons said. Harbor Freight Tools Harbor Freight Tools has leased the old Lindsey Furniture building at 250 N. Balsam St. and accessible from China Lake Boulevard. Harbor Freight Tools will use the entire 15,045 square foot building and has entered into a parking agreement with nearby Crossroads Community Church according to a staff report. Parsons reported that construction has started and that the business may be opening as quickly as two weeks from now. “They are that far along,” he said. The item was before the Planning Commission as a presentation to bring them up to date. According to Parsons, a staff site plan review of the project was previously conducted and approved contingent on several conditions, including signage modifications, controlling access to the alleyway, and double-striping and ADA compliance for the parking lot. Dave Matthews spoke up asking if the city council has to abandon the alley right of way. “That is correct, I believe,” Parsons said. “The city is not utilizing that alleyway right now.” Tractor Supply Co. The commission also approved a site plan review for Tractor Supply Co. Tractor Supply Co. has leased approximately one third (32,368 square feet) of the old Walmart building at 911 S. China Lake Blvd. Parsons described the project as a tenant improvement lease arrangement. “The building plans have been approved I believe and stand ready for construction. They have been approved through the building department process and those building plans are ready and we are ready to issue permits pending approval of the site plan by the Planning Commission. They would like to begin construction as soon as possible.” He added that the plan was for parking to be jointly used by all tenants, similar to a shopping center. Parsons said that Tractor Supply is planning to convert Walmart's old garden area into a big display area with equipment and hay. “I guess they do sell hay at Tractor Supply. It's kind of interesting,” he said. Parsons also asked the commission's opinion on an issue he said was not covered in the municipal code. Tractor Supply, he said, wants to change some parking and planter areas to display areas. “There is no code, so staff is asking the Planning Commission what their feeling is. Staff would recommend it, but its up to you. We didn't want to make a determination when there is no code.” “I am having a hard time considering this a burden,” Cox said. “The staff didn't consider it a burden either, that's why we are recommending it,” Parsons said. There was no public comment. The site plan review was approved unanimously by the four commissioners present. Drive-thru Starbucks The Planning Commission also discussed preliminary plans for a new Starbucks with a drive-thru at 1245 N. China Lake Blvd., at the corner of Ward and China Lake Blvd. The plans involve converting the current Pizza Hut building to a drive-thru Starbucks. No building plans were available at the meeting, so Parsons was asking for initial input only. “We believe this will be a time-sensitive project,” he said. “We may do a staff review on this and I wanted to get your input.” Parsons described the project as “fairly simple,” involving the re-use of the existing Pizza Hut building for a new drive-thru Starbucks. Plans would also include an outside patio and lowering the roof. “Its a large facility so it would be a large Starbucks. We are being informed that they may seek a liquor license as well, so it will be a wine and Starbucks,” he said. “We are looking for any input or major concerns you might have on this design,” he said. “They intend to use the existing sign exactly as it is, except it will say Starbucks there.” Sanders had a question. “How does this work with them wanting to serve liquor and have a drive-thru? Can they sell liquor from the drive-thru?” he asked. Michael McFadden, representing Starbucks and the architect responded. “I promise you we don't do that. They are very strict about their policies.” Dave Matthews also spoke up, expressing concern about the proximity of a nearby Christian school. No action was taken by the commission, but Parsons did take a moment to answer two other questions. For those who want to know what will become of Pizza Hut, he said, a preliminary conversation with “the Pizza Hut people” indicated they are looking at relocating their business but for pickup and delivery service only. “Do they plan on keeping the other [Starbucks] location open as well?” Yates asked. “They smile at me when I ask that, so we don't have the answer to that,” Parsons replied.

The surveillance footage, released by the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office on Wednesday, shows Michael Foster, 43, tackling Clarence Daniels from behind as he was walking into a Brandon, Fla. Wal-Mart on Tuesday. Foster followed Daniels into the store after seeing him exiting his vehicle with a gun holstered under his shirt — which was perfectly legal for the 62-year-old Daniels to do since he holds a concealed weapon license. Nevertheless, Foster tackled Daniels from behind as he entered the store, and put him in a chokehold before taking him to the ground. Witnesses said that Foster yelled out that Daniels had a gun. They also said that Daniels yelled out that he had a license for it. Foster called 911 only after he tackled accosted Daniels. He was arrested and charged with battery.

REUTERS/John Gress/Files A federal judge refused to order Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) to pay $80 million in penalties in a lawsuit alleging the retailer failed to pay hundreds of truck drivers in California the minimum compensation for certain tasks, the Associated Press reported. U.S. District Judge Susan Illston in San Francisco ruled on Wednesday that Wal-Mart acted in good faith when paying the drivers and reasonably believed its payment policy aligned with California law, AP reported. apne.ws/2jTppuK Current and former Wal-Mart truck drivers in California sued the company in 2008, claiming a plan that compensated drivers by mileage and activity rather than hours worked violated state law. The company dropped the plan in 2015. In November 2016, a jury held that Wal-Mart owed the drivers backpay and handed down a $55 million verdict against the company for failing to pay about 850 of its truck drivers all of the compensation to which they were entitled. "While we still disagree with the jury's verdict in the case, we're pleased the judge declined to award any additional penalties," Wal-Mart said in an emailed statement. U.S. District Judge Susan Illston in San Francisco previously ruled that Wal-Mart violated California law for not paying its truck drivers minimum wage for all work performed. Illston left the determination of damages for trial. Lawyers for the drivers had asked Illston to award an additional $80 million in penalties and damages. Wal-Mart said that its drivers were among the highest paid in the industry, earning about $80,000 to over $100,000 per year, adding that drivers were paid in compliance with California law and often in excess of what California law requires.

Lamar Ray, emergency management director, in Cook County where the deaths occurred Sunday, said he doesn't expect the toll to rise. Alexis Livingston, 18, Jamie Cantrell Walters, 33, Mary Cantrell, 62, Adreian Mays, 38, Lawansa Perry, 41, Amanda Rowe, 41, and Joe Deskins, 36, all died in the storm.  "At this time we believe everyone is accounted for," Ray said at a news conference Monday afternoon.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obituaries E-Edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive log in weather Will: The real cost of protectionism Wednesday Jan 25, 2017 at 11:14 PM Jan 25, 2017 at 11:14 PM George F. Will/Washington Post WASHINGTON — When the president speaks of closed factories scattered like “tombstones” across America, has he noticed the shuttered stores in shopping centers, and entire malls reduced to rubble? He promises “protection” to prevent foreigners from “destroying” manufacturing jobs by exporting to America things that Americans want to import. Does he know that one American company might be “destroying” more American jobs than China is? And that this supposed destruction is beneficial? The company is Amazon (market capitalization: $388 billion), created by Jeff Bezos. He owns The Washington Post, which syndicates this column, but it is for revolutionizing retailing that he ranks in the Pantheon of American business. He belongs there with Richard Warren Sears, Alvah Curtis Roebuck, Aaron Montgomery Ward and Sam Walton, all of whom were constructively disruptive retailers, and were as important in the nation’s commercial history as were Henry Ford, Steve Jobs and Bill Gates. In 2016, online buying during the holiday season surged 19 percent over the year before, which is one factor explaining this: Macy’s, after announcing in August that it would close another 100 of its remaining 730 stores, now says it will shed 10,000 jobs. Sears, which is 13 decades old and still has 1,600 stores, has lost $9 billion in five years, has closed 500 stores and is closing another 150 (including some Kmarts). Sears stores in American downtowns, and the Sears catalogue that put downtown goods within reach of rural America (3 million catalogues were distributed in 1907, when the nation’s population was 87 million), caused difficulties for older retailers. In the second half of the 20th century, Wal-Marts at the edge of towns caused difficulties for downtown retailers with pre-modern — meaning pre-Wal-Mart — global supply chains. Now Amazon is forcing Wal-Mart to master online retailing. Although e-commerce was just 8 percent of all 2016 retail sales, it came disproportionately at the expense of Sears, Macy’s and other “anchor tenants” that draw foot traffic from which other mall retailers benefit. When Amazon recently announced that it is going to create 100,000 warehousing and other jobs in the next 18 months, The New York Times reported that online retailing “has destroyed many times that number of positions at malls and shopping centers across America.” The Times quoted specialists’ calculations that traditional retailers have shed more than 200,000 employees since 2012, and that there are 1.2 million fewer retail workers than there would be if there were no online retailers. But Henry Ford, too, “destroyed” lots of jobs — those of blacksmiths, buggy makers, etc. — the holders of which moved on, and usually up. Writing at MarketWatch, Rex Nutting argues that as Amazon revolutionizes consumer behavior, it “is going to destroy more American jobs than China ever did.” If so, the “problem” is productivity. Nutting says “Amazon needs about half as many workers to sell $100 worth of merchandise as Macy’s does.” The Times reports that “the typical online retailer generates $1,267,000 in sales per employee versus $279,000 at bricks-and-mortar stores. All of which raises a question: Why should manufacturing jobs lost to foreign competition be privileged by protectionist policies in ways that jobs lost to domestic competition are not? When an Applebee’s or Olive Garden, powered by a national advertising budget, opens next to, and causes the closing of, Madge’s Diner, why does Madge not merit protection? Or the Trade Adjustment Assistance that is available for workers, firms, farmers, even communities that can plausibly claim to have been otherwise injured by foreign competition or outsourcing of jobs? The reason is this: Domestic protection of Madge and millions of others unsettled by the constant churning of a dynamic domestic economy would mean slow economic growth — and rapid growth of government as it regulates consumers’ choices and their consequences. But protection from imports also means this. Reactionary liberalism has long held, and today’s faux conservatism agrees, that existing jobs should be protected by policies that reduce the economic dynamism that threatens those jobs. Such protection means a net decrease in jobs but an increase in the self-esteem of blinkered protectionists who see the jobs “saved” but not those which, as a result of lost dynamism, are lost or never created. Macy’s flagship Manhattan store was one reason Gimbels’ nearby flagship closed, after 76 years, in 1986. This, even though in 1945 Gimbels had been America’s first merchant to offer “a fantastic, atomic era, miraculous pen.” It was a ballpoint. Will the winner of the once-famous Macy’s versus Gimbels rivalry always be with us? Probably not, which is probably good.

U.S. District Judge Susan Illston in San Francisco ruled on Wednesday that Wal-Mart acted in good faith when paying the drivers and reasonably believed its payment policy aligned with California law, AP reported. http://apne.ws/2jTppuK Current and former Wal-Mart truck drivers in California sued the company in 2008, claiming a plan that compensated drivers by mileage and activity rather than hours worked violated state law. The company dropped the plan in 2015. In November 2016, a jury held that Wal-Mart owed the drivers backpay and handed down a $55 million verdict against the company for failing to pay about 850 of its truck drivers all of the compensation to which they were entitled. "While we still disagree with the jury's verdict in the case, we're pleased the judge declined to award any additional penalties," Wal-Mart said in an emailed statement. U.S. District Judge Susan Illston in San Francisco previously ruled that Wal-Mart violated California law for not paying its truck drivers minimum wage for all work performed. Illston left the determination of damages for trial. Lawyers for the drivers had asked Illston to award an additional $80 million in penalties and damages. Wal-Mart said that its drivers were among the highest paid in the industry, earning about $80,000 to over $100,000 per year, adding that drivers were paid in compliance with California law and often in excess of what California law requires.

In a new scam, thieves are draining money from the cards once shoppers load them up. Pearl City teen Michael Tam is one of many local victims. He got a $75 Walmart gift card for Christmas and wanted to buy a Nerf gun for some fun. "I was happy that I got what I wanted for Christmas," Tam said. But when he tried to make the purchase at Walmart, there was a big surprise. "I swiped the card and it said the card balance was zero," he said. A search of the gift card's history showed his relative bought it in Torrance, Calif., but the balance was drained five days later in a different California city. "What we believe is happening is that people within the store, either an employee of the store or an actual thief, steals the cards," said Gregory Dunn, president and CEO of Hawaii's Better Business Bureau. Dunn said consumers shouldn't buy gift cards from store racks because they're open to thieves. "They'll steal the card, take them home, be very careful about opening the card up, remove the pin number scratch, record the card and the pin number and then re-affix a scratch off cover over the pin," he said. The Better Business Bureau says once the scammers have the card number and pin, they wait for it to be activated. As soon as the amount is shown, they can steal the money in an instant. "Criminals are finding new ways to use new technology to cheat you out of your hard earned money," Dunn said. Walmart's gift card policy says that lost or stolen cards will not be replaced and the company is not liable for lost or stolen cards by third parties. For consumers, the financial loss hurts. But there's also an emotional sting and that rings true for Tam. He's bummed he got ripped off by a Christmas Grinch. Here are some tips to avoid gift card scams: Don't buy gift cards from store racks. Buy gift cards online. Use your credit card when purchasing gift cards so if there's a problem, you can make a claim with your credit card company. Copyright 2017 HawaiiNewsNow. All rights reserved.

He promises "protection" to prevent foreigners from "destroying" manufacturing jobs by exporting to America things that Americans want to import. Does he know that one American company might be "destroying" more American jobs than China is? And that this supposed destruction is beneficial?The company is Amazon (market capitalization: $388 billion), created by Jeff Bezos. He owns the Washington Post, which syndicates this column, but it is for revolutionizing retailing that he ranks in the Pantheon of American business. He belongs there with Richard Warren Sears, Alvah Curtis Roebuck, Aaron Montgomery Ward, and Sam Walton, all of whom were constructively disruptive retailers, and were as important in the nation's commercial history as were Henry Ford, Steve Jobs, and Bill Gates. In 2016, online buying during the holiday season surged 19 percent over the year before, which is one factor explaining this: Macy's, after announcing in August that it would close another 100 of its remaining 730 stores, now says it will shed 10,000 jobs. Sears, which is 13 decades old and still has 1,600 stores, has lost $9 billion in five years, has closed 500 stores, and is closing an additional 150 (including some Kmarts). Sears stores in American downtowns, and the Sears catalogue that put downtown goods within reach of rural America (3 million catalogues were distributed in 1907, when the nation's population was 87 million), caused difficulties for older retailers. In the second half of the 20th century, Walmarts at the edge of towns caused difficulties for downtown retailers with pre-modern - meaning pre-Walmart - global supply chains. Now Amazon is forcing Walmart to master online retailing. Although e-commerce was just 8 percent of all 2016 retail sales, it came disproportionately at the expense of Sears, Macy's, and other "anchor tenants" that draw foot traffic from which other mall retailers benefit. When Amazon recently announced that it is going to create 100,000 warehousing and other jobs in the next 18 months, the New York Times reported that online retailing "has destroyed many times that number of positions at malls and shopping centers across America." The Times quoted specialists' calculations that traditional retailers have shed more than 200,000 employees since 2012 and that there are 1.2 million fewer retail workers than there would be if there were no online retailers. But Henry Ford, too, "destroyed" lots of jobs - those of blacksmiths, buggy makers, etc. - the holders of which moved on, and usually up. Writing at MarketWatch, Rex Nutting argues that as Amazon revolutionizes consumer behavior, it "is going to destroy more American jobs than China ever did." If so, the "problem" is productivity. Nutting says "Amazon needs about half as many workers to sell $100 worth of merchandise as Macy's does." The Times reports that "the typical online retailer generates $1,267,000 in sales per employee versus $279,000 at bricks-and-mortar stores." All of which raises a question: Why should manufacturing jobs lost to foreign competition be privileged by protectionist policies in ways that jobs lost to domestic competition are not? When an Applebee's or Olive Garden, powered by a national advertising budget, opens next to, and causes the closing of, Madge's Diner, why does Madge not merit protection? Or the Trade Adjustment Assistance that is available for workers, firms, farmers, even communities that can plausibly claim to have been otherwise injured by foreign competition or outsourcing of jobs? The reason is this: Domestic protection of Madge and millions of others unsettled by the constant churning of a dynamic domestic economy would mean slow economic growth - and rapid growth of government as it regulates consumers' choices and their consequences. But protection from imports also means this. Reactionary liberalism has long held, and today's faux conservatism agrees, that existing jobs should be protected by policies that reduce the economic dynamism that threatens those jobs. Such protection means a net decrease in jobs but an increase in the self-esteem of blinkered protectionists who see the jobs "saved" but not those which, as a result of lost dynamism, are lost or never created. Macy's flagship Manhattan store was one reason Gimbels' nearby flagship closed, after 76 years, in 1986. This, even though in 1945 Gimbels had been America's first merchant to offer "a fantastic, atomic era, miraculous pen." It was a ballpoint. Will the winner of the once-famous Macy's versus Gimbels rivalry always be with us? Probably not, which is probably good.

The firm, The Law Store, was established in Walmarts in Joplin and Neosho and quickly expanded to include a Springfield location and two in Dallas, Texas by year’s end. It’s the first known firm in the U.S. to be located in the retailer’s stores, filling leased spaces near other professional services like vision centers, medical clinics and banks. Hershewe said the idea for the location stemmed from an interest he’s had in building a national law firm. His vision evolved from being a largely virtual firm to one located in brick-and-mortar locations. “What I always intended to do was deliver good legal services, hopefully through automated processes, that would kind of replace online legal services that aren’t really legal services,” he said. He pointed to companies like Avvo, LegalZoom and Rocket Lawyer. “To compete with them, you have to have automated services where the price point is good for the consumers,” he said. His initial attempts to raise the idea with the company were rejected, but after revisiting it following the recession, he found a more receptive audience. Hershewe said he envisioned that the store would be staffed with lawyers, provide reasonable and transparent pricing and operate in convenient hours. He still maintains a separate personal injury firm in Joplin, the Hershewe Law Firm. He said he didn’t want to put that type of a firm in Walmart, however. “I wanted to be more like a family lawyer,” he said. “We did a little bit of everything and tried to do it quickly, inexpensively and for people, to be a help.” He said the goal is to quickly assist customers with their legal needs. “We pride ourselves on automated processes. It speeds up the process and makes it reasonably priced for everyone,” he said. “We pride ourselves on getting the folks in, getting their project done, getting them out and going on to the next person.” The Law Store includes a wide range of services, from wills and estate planning, traffic tickets and basic small-business and real estate needs. It will also accept personal injury, family and elder law, immigration and bankruptcy matters, with more complex cases referred to outside attorneys. So far, he said the response has been positive. “We offered them something they haven’t had before,” he said. “It’s convenient, there’s really no barriers that are put up to going to see a lawyer if you’re going to The Law Store.” The firm has plans to continue its expansion in 2017. Three stores are slated to open in Kansas City area Walmarts – in Liberty, Blue Springs and Lee’s Summit – and a third is set to open in the Dallas metro area. 10:37 am Wed, January 25, 2017 Missouri Lawyers Media Jessica Shumaker tweet Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

The Bates Student THE VOICE OF BATES COLLEGE SINCE 1873 Current Issue News Forum Arts & Leisure Sports News A walk with a Russian Interview with Lera Fedorova. webert Published on January 25, 2017 0 Likes 0 Comments Roger Williams at sunset as William interviews Lera Fedorova. MAX HUANG/THE BATES STUDENT Lera Fedorova is the devoted and deliberate Russian TA who graciously sat down with The Bates Student to give us her story. Lera Fedorova:  I’m from Russia, I live in a city called Orel, ah yes it is not far from Moscow. So I studied at the university and I got a bachelor’s degree there, and now I am getting my master’s. William Ebert: What did you do for fun as a kid? LF: First I went to puppet theater, I was participating there with all the puppets and all these things. And then I decided to go to art school and I studied there for 6 years and I finished it quite early since most people there were 2 or 3 years older than me, than I was. Me and my friends usually, we just, we just went out for walk. I noticed here, that people don’t really walk, just to walk. So people usually go to some places to cinemas, to theaters, to park. But in Russia, it is a general thing, you always see kids outside, they are just walking, just in the streets. Once when I just arrived here in Lewiston, I decided to walk a little bit and I needed some stuff so I decided to go to Walmart, and I walked to Walmart. And I think 3 cars stopped and asked if everything is ok with me, do I need a ride or something? I was just walking! Yeah, so it was crazy a little bit for me. WE: What was it like living in Russia? What was different than living here? LF: I can’t say that I feel much difference, because I am here as adult, I am an adult here. But I can say that we had lots of freedom from our parents. I think, well as far as I can judge, here it is not that freedom. If I may say so again, because they let me go to the city center to meet my friends especially in the summer; I just had to be home at certain time, but everything was fine. Yeah, I think these moments that they give you freedom to grow up or to be with your friends or to somehow understanding to behave yourself and yeah. WE: What is one defining moment in your life? LF: I think this was the moment when I, um, moved out from my parents flat, because before that, the period before that was somehow defining and when I started living on my own was also one of those moments. So before that for five or six months, I was working hard, I was studying all the time, I almost didn’t show up at my parents place just to sleep, and not even every night, so I was real busy. I almost didn’t talk to my parents, they of course didn’t like they, they didn’t see their daughter in a while, she was supposed to be with them all the time. And there was one moment when I, some evening, I decided to talk to my father and he told me about his hunt, he’s a hunter, yes and I asked about his friend, something like ‘How is he?’ And he looked at me strangely and said that he died two months before. And this was horrible for me because he was one of my parents, my father’s best friends, and I didn’t know about it. Yes, at this moment, I realized I needed to change everything somehow, and my parents probably realized that we need to do something. And I think a month after it, I moved out to my apartment and I don’t know why, I separated from my parents and it was hard for all of us, but we became closer and uh, I realized the importance of talking to your close people to spending time with your close people, and finding this time. Because before I thought, come on I live with them, they see me; isn’t that enough? Haha, they sometimes see me. Yes, but after that, all this period, I realized this importance. I always talk with my mother, I call my father maybe once a week probably and we talk a few hours, so yes. This is very important thing. WE: What do you think of the States? LF: I like it a lot. I didn’t think that, States um, were going to be much different from Russia. Of course they are different, but I mean the mentality and all the things. But it is. It is very different, it very interesting to see how people here behave how people here communicate. And I really enjoyed being here while the elections. Yes, I realize that for you guys it is not that fun, but for me it was just interesting to see how everyone reacted to everything because in Russia for the last few years people don’t really care about the elections and just political things they don’t care. They like to discuss something, but they never understand anything and it can only be a couple of words. But here people are really into politics and people understand what it is, I don’t understand what politics at all or anything, it is just impossible for me to talk about it, so I was quite fascinated by this moment and I don’t know, just general mentalities of things. WE: What is the best thing and the worst thing about America? LE: I really like that it is possible to bring your dog to every place. It is so amazing! And seeing dogs everywhere and even in planes, and during studies, some teachers bring their dogs, Roger Williams where I work, there is one teacher who bring her dog all the time. And this is amazing. It could never happen in Russia, I don’t think. I never saw this, and it is really hard to bring your dog to a restaurant or some place. Um to shop no, everywhere is no dogs, no dogs. And the worst thing…um…I had some moments, I dislike this American smile. Yeah, not the smile, the smile itself. It is very curious how people, when you’re just some person walking and the person smiles. But this is not the thing. The smile is in their face but then you never know what they really mean, what they really say, what is really on their mind. Yeah, we are cool, and you are cool, and everything is cool, but in reality they have something in their mind, something different. WE: How did you end up at Bates? LF: My university has some kind of collaboration with Bates. So every year or two uh teacher assistants from my university come to Bates, and students from Bates, sometimes, once in a few years, come to my city to study Russian studies, Russian culture and Ecology a little bit also so, yes two years ago was the last time they came, and I helped with the organization of everything with their coming and after that yes, the previous spring, my professor asked me if I want to go here. And I agree. Yes, I really like being here. Just the organization, and the students, I really love my students you know, choosing to study Russian. Is a very difficult decision to make since it is difficult, but I really enjoy it a lot.

Shortly before midnight Jan. 23, Emmett Township Public Safety officers were called to the parking lot of Meijer at 6405 B Drive North in Harper Village on a reported vehicle fire, according to a news release from the department. When officers arrived they were told that the fire was intentionally set and witnesses described a man they saw sticking a rag or shirt into the gas tank and starting it on fire. Witnesses called 911 and attempted to extinguish the fire on their own, authorities said. Witnesses were able to provide officers with descriptions of the man and the vehicle he was driving, and as fire crews finished extinguishing the car fire, a second fire was discovered by employees in the bathroom at the Meijer gas station. Emmett Township units responded to that call as well, and witness descriptions of the man they saw matched the description of the man accused of setting the car fire. Other units were called into the area when a suspect matching that description was found inside Walmart at 6020 B Drive North, suspected of attempting to commit a retail fraud. Emmett Police and Fire units responded, and found a man and a vehicle in the parking lot of Walmart, which both matched the descriptions of witnesses. But as officers approached the man, he drove off at a high rate of speed, ramming an Emmett DPS fire engine head-on, authorities said. The fire truck was pulling into the Walmart parking lot to check for the possibility that the man had set another fire inside that store. After the man rammed the fire truck a second time he fled eastbound on B Drive North, authorities said.  Emmett units, assisted by Battle Creek police and Michigan State Police, followed the suspect, whose vehicle was heavily damaged from striking the fire truck, at speeds of 25-40 mph. The vehicle finally went into a ditch on B Drive North west of Silver Springs Lane.   At that point the man was taken into custody without further incident. There were no injuries reported, but damage to the fire truck was extensive. Estimates of the damage to Meijer gas station and the car that was set on fire were not immediately available.   Further investigation showed that the man may have unsuccessfully attempted to start additional fires inside of the occupied Meijer store. The man will be charged with multiple counts including Arson, Fleeing and Eluding, Damage to Fire Apparatus and additional charges, authorities said. His name was not released. The incident remains under investigation.

The surveillance footage, released by the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office on Wednesday, shows Michael Foster, 43, tackling Clarence Daniels from behind as he was walking into a Brandon, Fla. Wal-Mart on Tuesday. Foster followed Daniels into the store after seeing him exiting his vehicle with a gun holstered under his shirt — which was perfectly legal for the 62-year-old Daniels to do since he holds a concealed weapon license. Nevertheless, Foster tackled Daniels from behind as he entered the store, and put him in a chokehold before taking him to the ground. Witnesses said that Foster yelled out that Daniels had a gun. They also said that Daniels yelled out that he had a license for it. Foster called 911 only after he tackled accosted Daniels. He was arrested and charged with battery.

Eight years of winter sailing on our catamaran, Sunshine, came to a tragic end in May 2015 when the Coast Guard tried to help us by towing our boat in the Gulf of Mexico and ended up sinking her. But life goes on. You pick yourself up, dust yourself off and search for another adventure. Back on land in Greenwood for that summer, we began to think about buying an RV. As much as we love the ocean, we have not visited a lot of the western United States. After lots of reading and tramping around RV lots, we decided on a 37-foot fifth wheel, an RV that extends over the bed of a pickup truck. Story continues below gallery 1 of 3 Margaret McGovern next to a marker showing how high the water rose during Hurricane Katrina at St. Bernard State Park, eight miles south of New Orleans, during the couple's travels in their RV. Submitted Margaret and Phil McGovern​ ​a​re traveling in their fifth wheel RV and sharing some of their experiences on the road. ​ Submitted Greenwood residents Phil and Margaret McGovern travel in their RV and stopped at Billy's Famous Barbecue in Jasper, Texas, which has been opened in this location for 36 years. Submitted We spent the rest of the summer reading and studying about our RV, purchasing the necessary equipment and supplies, and making trial runs to state parks. When summer ended and the temperature began to drop, we packed up and headed south and west. That first winter on the road was a learning experience. There is a big difference between an RV and a boat when you are looking for a place to spend the night. On our sailboat, we could drop the anchor anyplace that offered a little shelter and was shallow enough for the anchor to reach the bottom. We usually planned in advance, but sometimes we simply discovered a place along the way. It might be a deserted island off the coast of Belize or a cove along the mainland of Honduras. Finding a good place to park an RV is quite different. If you don’t plan ahead and make reservations, you might find yourself spending the night in a Walmart parking lot (yes) or a rest area along the interstate (not yet). Pulling an RV and piloting a boat are also very different. On a boat, the only times you might run into something was usually at a dock, in a marina, or getting too close to bridge pilings or other boats. Driving an RV, the whole world is an obstacle course. Fences, guard rails, gates, diesel pumps, overhead canopies, curbs, cars, trucks, trees and many other hazards jump out at you around every turn. And those hazards sometimes leave permanent marks on your brand new RV for all the world to see. One of the first things you learn driving a 19-foot truck towing a 37-foot RV is that you must make extremely wide turns. Cutting a curve too closely can leave a path of destruction in its wake. Campgrounds are notorious for narrow roads and trees close to the road. Many of the state and federal parks were constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps between 1933 and 1942, before RVs became so popular and so big. Roads, bridges and campsites in those parks often reflect a time when tent campers were more common and travel trailers were small. Overhead hazards are everywhere. Our RV is 13.6-feet high. It is difficult to judge how high a branch or an electric line is. Sometimes you just have to chance it and be ready for the consequences if you misjudged. Fortunately, most low-clearance bridges and overpasses are clearly marked. Those measurements are accurate unless the road beneath has been repaved many times, rendering the markings obsolete. Walmart became our friend while we traveled. The parking lot was always big enough for us to park our rig and we could purchase most everything we needed, including prescription refills, at any Walmart store. Another difference between a boat and an RV becomes evident when you park, or anchor, for the night. With a boat, one person is at the steering wheel and another is at the front of the boat. You pick your spot, drop the anchor, and then back down to secure the anchor. It’s not quite that simple, but almost. There are few things that can threaten a 47-year marriage, but backing a fifth wheel into a narrow campsite is one of them. The process defies common sense. If you want your rig to back to the left, you turn the steering wheel to the right, and vice versa. Since the pivot point is in the bed of the truck, the RV doesn’t respond right away. Judging when it will begin to turn is a talent that we haven’t yet acquired. Some campgrounds have pull-through sites that don’t require backing in, but we usually seem to get assigned to the back-in sites. Watching fifth wheel drivers try to park their rigs is considered great entertainment at most campgrounds. Our first season on the road was very positive and lots of fun. We made it all the way to Pancho Villa State Park in New Mexico, right on the border with Mexico. We saw amazing scenery, met interesting people, explored small towns and big cities, and learned a lot. The most beautiful wild flowers are in Texas. New Orleans is probably our favorite city so far, with great music and pralines to die for. Most states have better roads than Indiana, except for Louisiana, which has terrible roads. Texans drive the fastest. The speed limit on most two-lane roads in Texas is 70 mph, sometimes 75 mph. Southern New Mexico is a desert, with dust storms and road runners. We have learned some history along the way. Mexican independence fighter Pancho Villa raided the small town of Columbus, New Mexico, in 1916 and then fled back across the border. U.S. General Pershing arrived in Columbus with 12,000 troops and crossed the border looking for Pancho Villa. He was never captured. And finally, pick up an armadillo under its arms, never by the tail. This winter, we are traveling again. We have gained some skills and are still working on others. We have made it to Texas and are headed to California, then maybe Oregon, then maybe Seattle. Where we go depends on the weather and on our mood and imagination. The adventure continues! Phil and Margaret McGovern of Greenwood are spending the winter traveling in their RV. Margaret, a commercial real estate broker and former mayor of Greenwood, writes about the couple’s journey.

The victim of this week’s crime works in an office on the fourth floor of a local hospital.  It’s a place that would be difficult to find by accident. She says her debit card was stolen from her purse while it was in her office.  The detective working the case says three suspects were captured on camera at a Jonesboro Walmart allegedly using that stolen card. The suspects are two women and one man.  It's one of the bigger takes we've seen on Crimestoppers.  The report says the suspects made one purchase for $1200, and another for over $1300.  A third attempt to use the card was declined.  The video from Walmart also shows the suspects came together in a white SUV, maybe a Toyota. If you can make an ID on any of these suspects, it could be worth money.  Call in that tip to Crimestoppers at 935-STOP.  JPD is also looking for a pair of people with a combined total of 26 warrants.  Michael Nesby has the smaller list this week.  He's on the books for half a dozen Fail to Appear warrants out of JPD. Vaughn Allen Carter more than triples that total.  He has 20 warrants.  18 for contempt of court for non payment of fines, and a pair of fail to appear warrants. If you can help police track down Vaughn A. Carter or Michael Nesby, Crimestoppers has some money for you.  Call in that tip to Crimestoppers anonymously at 935-STOP or text it. Take your iPhone or Droid phone and type in 2-7-4-6-3-7 or type in the word "CRIMES" if your phone can do that.  Then, in the message, type in 935stop. One word, followed by your tip.  Hit send and you'll get a message back from Crimestoppers with your anonymous tip number.  This is yours to keep for any future reward.  That's how Crimestoppers works, 935-STOP Copyright 2017 KAIT.

(REUTERS/Rebecca Cook)    4443001 Video footage taken from a Florida Wal-Mart shows a shopper literally jumping the gun. The surveillance footage, released by the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office on Wednesday, shows Michael Foster, 43, tackling Clarence Daniels from behind as he was walking into a Brandon, Fla. Wal-Mart on Tuesday. Foster followed Daniels into the store after seeing him exiting his vehicle with a gun holstered under his shirt — which was perfectly legal for the 62-year-old Daniels to do since he holds a concealed weapon license. Nevertheless, Foster tackled Daniels from behind as he entered the store, and put him in a chokehold before taking him to the ground. Witnesses said that Foster yelled out that Daniels had a gun. They also said that Daniels yelled out that he had a license for it. Foster called 911 only after he tackled accosted Daniels. He was arrested and charged with battery.

A learning moment for kids, but education officials had other ideas. (Photo by Patrick Semansky/Associated Press) By Sal Rodriguez Posted: 01/24/17, 3:44 PM PST | Updated: 3 days ago # Comments The day before President Donald Trump’s inauguration, the United Teachers Los Angeles, which represents teachers in the Los Angeles Unified School District, convened demonstrations throughout the district, enlisting students, teachers and parents. Calling the gatherings a “Shield Our Schools Action,” participants held signs reading “Shield Against ...” a litany of easily relatable concerns, like racism and sexism and anti-Semitism, things that no decent person would go out of their way to speak in favor of. On its own, such a stand against such terrible –isms certainly seemed important, even valiant. But this wasn’t one of those feel-good demonstrations against racism. It was a co-opting of the natural revulsion to racism and sexism as a means of guilting people into making connections that otherwise wouldn’t exist. Among the signs against racism and sexism were signs condemning Trump, his nominee for secretary of education, Eli Broad and Walmart, as well as the privatization of education and union busting. This wasn’t about racism or even about standing up for a quality education. It was about linking education reform to polarizing ideas, people and practices. “We are here today for a simple reason,” said Alex Caputo-Pearl, president of UTLA. “We are here to stand up against anti-immigrant policies, against hate-filled rhetoric, and we are going to stand with parents, with students, against federal cuts to education budgets, and we are going to stand against the privatization of our public school system.” The narrative that sinister billionaires like Broad want to undermine public education, bust unions and make profits by being racist, sexist anti-Semites only makes sense if you live in the world of the teachers union. Broad evidently has committed a grave sin, from the UTLA perspective, by donating to charter schools — public schools with greater flexibility than typical public schools — which have boomed in popularity statewide and nationwide because of the inadequacy of regular public schools. So too has the Walton family, who own Walmart and have pledged $1 billion towards bolstering charter schools. In brief, the UTLA vigorously opposes charter schools mainly because they represent a plausible threat to their stranglehold over public education in LAUSD. Never mind that, according to the California Charter Schools Association, more than 600,000 students now attend charter schools in California. In 2015, nearly 160,000 students were on waiting lists to attend such schools. Advertisement Parents rightly want the best education for their child they can find, something hard to do in a district like LAUSD, which has long underperformed — from producing students who aren’t proficient in reading and mathematics to SAT and ACT scores below county, state and national averages. Alas, rather than advocating for parents and students, demonizing alternatives beyond pouring more money into mediocre systems is par for the course with unions like UTLA. Meanwhile, come inauguration day, the LAUSD held a “Unity Day” featuring “unity dances, poster sessions and restorative justice circles,” and suggested lessons focused on environmental, social and humanitarian topics. “There is a difference between staying neutral for pedagogical reasons to share different perspectives, and engaging in rhetoric that is disrespectful and biased,” the district’s Office of Human Relations, Diversity & Equity advised. This is in stark contrast to the glee with which the district welcomed the inauguration of President Barack Obama, with encouragements that students wear Obama T-shirts and recite from Obama’s “Yes We Can” speech. Having unfortunately been an LAUSD student at the time, I can recall the feelings of revulsion over such fawning welcoming of a president who, incidentally, went on to set records for deportations. Notably, none of this has anything to do with the core mission of schools those who teach in them. It’s all politics and pandering. Instead of using K-12 schools and students as platforms and pawns in a political game, maybe our efforts can be refocused towards actually educating students and exploring ways to improve education, even if it’s politically inconvenient.

But it would hurt Americans by Patrick Gillespie   @CNNMoney January 26, 2017: 6:19 PM ET Spicer: Tax on imports to fund border wall The Trump administration floated the idea of using a 20% tax on goods imported from Mexico to pay for the wall. The math works. The U.S. imported $303 billion from Mexico in 2015 and 20% of that is about $60 billion -- more than enough to pay for President Trump's wall on the border. But it's not that simple. American companies and consumers would bear the brunt of such a tariff. On Thursday, Trump's press secretary, Sean Spicer, told reporters that Trump would propose a 20% tariff on all goods shipped from Mexico to the U.S. to pay for the wall. The White House later clarified that it is just one option. Experts say a tariff would raise a mountain of concerns about U.S. jobs, the prices of products, and who actually pays for the wall. "The notion that a 20% tariff is a way of forcing Mexico to pay for the wall, it's just a falsehood. It's a way of forcing American consumers to pay for the wall," says Edward Alden a trade expert at the Council on Foreign Relations. Here's why. First, about 6 million U.S. jobs depend on trade with Mexico, according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Experts say those jobs would be jeopardized if Trump restricts trade with Mexico. Americans will very likely face higher prices for many things -- from cars and computers to avocados and Corona. A litany of products imported from Mexico would be more expensive. Companies from Ford (F) and GM (GM) to retailers like Walmart (WMT) and Best Buy (BBY) will likely be hit hard. Taxing Mexican imports affects many U.S. companies that send parts south of the border to be assembled. About 40% of the parts in a typical Mexican import originate in the United States. For example, before a car arrives at a local dealership, its parts criss-cross the U.S, Mexican and Canadian borders. It's how supply chains are used today. Related: 40% of a Mexican import is American There are other less obvious ways a blunt tariff could come back to bite Americans. Higher prices on some products mean that Americans would have less money to spend on others. That would end up costing jobs. That's what happened in 2009 after President Obama used tariffs on Chinese tires. It cost more jobs than it saved because prices for tires went up, one study found. And a Trump tariff would apply to many more products, so the ripple effects would be a lot broader. That brings us to who pays for the wall. When the U.S. government applies a tariff on Mexican goods shipped into the U.S., Mexican companies don't pay the tariff -- American companies pay it. Companies usually pass the increased cost of goods down to consumers, hence the higher price tag. So yes, a 20% tariff would pay for the wall. But Mexico would not be paying for it. American consumers would ultimately pay the price. Literally. Related: A new NAFTA deal could bring jobs back -- at a cost Mexico would suffer too. Its economy heavily relies on trade with the United States, and about 80% of all its exports go north of the border. A big tariff would discourage American firms from buying Mexican products. Trump's threats could just be a war of words to strong arm Mexico into paying for the border wall. Peter Navarro, who heads the White House National Trade Council, told CNNMoney during the campaign that the threat of a tariff would be a strategy to get Mexico into a better trade deal. Trump wants to renegotiate NAFTA, the free trade deal between Mexico, Canada and the U.S. The same logic could be applied to paying for the wall. "The tariff is not an end game, it's a strategy -- a strategy to renegotiate trade deals," Navarro said at the time. "Tariffs wouldn't put U.S. jobs at risk." If the tariff happens, the U.S. should expect Mexico to retaliate. Mexico's economy minister, Ildfonso Guajardo, said Mexico would respond immediately to any tariffs Trump imposes on Mexico. "It's very clear that we have to be prepared to immediately be able to neutralize the impact of a measure of that nature," Guajardo said on a Mexican news show that aired January 13. Guajardo added: A Trump tariff "will have a wave of impacts that can take us into a global recession."

Sylvia Mathews Burwell, 51, has just been named the next president of American University. She is the first woman lead the university. “My family and I are honored and excited to become a part of this vibrant AU community,” Burwell said. “American University’s distinctive mix of academic strengths, its influential scholars, engaged students, successful alumni and extraordinary location are great assets.” Burwell served as director of Office of Management and Budget for President Barack Obama before heading up the HHS. She also served under President Bill Clinton as his Deputy Chief of Staff.  The Hinrton, WV native earned her undergraduate degree from Harvard University and is also a Rhodes Scholar. Burwell is married and has two children. Read the full news release below issued by American University: Sylvia Mathews Burwell, who was most recently the Secretary of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) under former President Barack Obama, has been named the 15th President of American University in Washington, DC. She succeeds Neil Kerwin as president and will assume her responsibilities on June 1, 2017. Burwell, the first woman to hold the highest leadership position at AU, emerged as the top candidate in a very competitive national search. “Secretary Burwell’s success at HHS reflects three key abilities that will make her an excellent president for our university. She fosters research and scholarship, and turns them into action. She embraces and leverages the strengths of a large, diverse institution to advance its goals, and she is able to convey complex ideas to a wide range of audiences, from members of congress to the public, in pushing for evidence-based actions and outcomes,” said Kiho Kim, professor of environmental science at AU and a member of the Presidential Search Committee.

(AP Photo/Susan Walsh) “My family and I are honored and excited to become a part of this vibrant AU community,” Burwell said. “American University’s distinctive mix of academic strengths, its influential scholars, engaged students, successful alumni and extraordinary location are great assets.” Burwell comes to AU after having served as the 22nd Secretary of HHS, a role she held from 2014 through the end of President Obama’s second term. Prior to that Cabinet appointment, Burwell was Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), also a Cabinet position. A Leader of Immense Character and Vision An accomplished senior government official and global foundation executive, Burwell is a leader of immense character and vision, known for her rigor of thought and laser-like focus on mission. A Rhodes Scholar, she possesses an inherent intellectual curiosity that she has applied to push the boundaries of knowledge in order to address complex problems. “These traits, combined with her experience and commitment to education and research, make her well-suited to lead AU at this moment in our history, as we build on the momentum and progress achieved in recent years,” said Jack Cassell, Chairman of AU’s Board of Trustees. Burwell has managed large and complex organizations across the public and private sector. Her career reflects strategic thought leadership at the highest levels of U.S. government, and global executive leadership at two of the world’s largest and most well-known non-profit and corporate foundations. Prior to her roles in the Obama Administration, she was President of the Walmart Foundation, where she led efforts to fight hunger in America, empower women around the world and improve local communities. Previously, she served at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation for a decade as Chief Operating Officer and then as the founding President of the Gates Foundation’s Global Development Program, where she helped advance solutions to some of the world’s most pressing global public health issues.

Photo courtesy of Sylvia Burwell.  University of Pennsylvania President Emerita and Rockefeller Foundation President, Judith Rodin, said, “I applaud the American University community on this outstanding appointment. Sylvia Burwell is a visionary, strategic and talented leader with an unmatched drive for excellence. She loves learning and rigorous debate, and has a passion for engaging people, from students to scholars, in the critical issues of the day. All of these qualities make her perfect for a 21st Century university presidency.” “Given the challenges facing higher education, our nation, and our world, I think there is no better time for American University to assert its considerable strengths, to lead and convene thought leaders, and take on the world’s thorniest problems. I welcome the opportunity to help AU expand its scholarly influence, enhance the student experience, and be a model for inclusion and innovation at a time when these ideals are vitally important,” Burwell said. During her recent government tenure, HHS advanced the most comprehensive reform of the nation’s health care system in a generation; confronted urgent public health issues, such as the opioid crisis; through the Centers for Disease Control, addressed the Zika and Ebola outbreaks; and at the National Institutes of Health, supported advancements at the forefront of biomedical research. At OMB, she helped lead the negotiations that won a landmark two-year budget agreement. Burwell also held leadership roles in the Clinton Administration, including as Deputy Chief of Staff to the President and Chief of Staff to the U.S. Secretary of Treasury. She has served on the boards of the Council on Foreign Relations, MetLife, and the University of Washington Medical center, among other organizations. Burwell earned an A.B. in Government from Harvard University, and earned a BA in Philosophy, Policy and Economics from the University of Oxford. She is married and has two children. A Transformed Institution Burwell inherits a university on a remarkable ascent over the last decade. During Neil Kerwin’s tenure, AU has experienced the most intensive period of transformation in its history—both in prestige and in physical space. AU research, as classified by the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education, improved to the level “Doctoral: Higher Research Activity,” placing it in the company of research from institutions such as Dartmouth College and William and Mary. This resulted from strategic decisions to expand the number of doctoral programs and increase externally funded research productivity. AU became more selective, dramatically reducing its admission rate to 26 percent, the lowest in school history. The university more than doubled the amount of need-based financial aid and has seen a 21 percent decrease in average student debt for graduates with loans. Initiatives to personalize and integrate student services across campus and to better cultivate diversity and inclusion aim to make AU feel like home for all students. The most visible indication of AU’s transformation over the past 10 years is the more than 1.5 million new and/or renovated square feet of teaching, learning and residence hall space on main campus and the Washington College of Law’s new Tenley Campus. “AU’s trajectory over the last decade enables us to leverage our strengths and think in bold, ambitious ways,” Burwell said. What others say about Sylvia Burwell “She’s a proven manager who’s demonstrated her ability to build great teams, forge strong relationships and deliver excellent results at the highest levels and she’s done it both in the public and the private sectors.” President Barack Obama (in remarks to announce her nomination as HHS Secretary) “Sylvia’s done a great job of helping us build a world-class organization and created a transformative grant-making program that is helping millions of poor people around the world. She put our global development work on a path to success, and we look forward to building on it.” Bill Gates, co-chairman of the Gates Foundation (quote from a 2012 press release announcing Burwell’s departure) “Given recent events in our nation and on our campus, there is a not a more vital time in higher education for tested, strategic, and inclusive leadership. Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell has an extensive background that embodies all of these traits. Secretary Burwell has tackled our nation’s most difficult problems through her career in public service, and I am fully confident that she will bring this same care and effectiveness to the student experience at American University.” Shyheim Snead, AU Student Trustee and Frederick Douglass Distinguished Scholar “Sylvia Mathews Burwell is a unique breed of leader that will combine seamlessly her experience managing complex institutions with her deeply held appreciation that our university's greatest asset is our people: the students, alumni, faculty, and staff. I am confident that under her leadership, AU's trajectory, by every measure, is about to enter a new orbit.” Andrea Agathoklis Murino, Partner, Goodwin Procter, LLP President, American University Alumni Association NEWSMore>> Justice-owned coal mines owe $4.6 million in fines and penalties Justice-owned coal mines owe $4.6 million in fines and penalties Mining operations controlled by West Virginia Governor Jim Justice owe millions of dollars in safety fines and penalties, according to MSHA officials.  More >> Mining operations controlled by West Virginia Governor Jim Justice owe millions of dollars in safety fines and penalties, according to MSHA officials. More >> Anti-abortion groups hold triumphant rally after Obama years Anti-abortion groups hold triumphant rally after Obama years Updated: Friday, January 27 2017 4:32 PM EST2017-01-27 21:32:47 GMT For the first time in years, abortion foes will have all the political momentum when they rally on the National Mall in Washington, D.CMore >> The anti-abortion movement gathered for a triumphant rally on the National MallMore >> Raleigh County Sheriff's Department looking to hire deputies Raleigh County Sheriff's Department looking to hire deputies The Raleigh County Sheriff's Office is looking for a few good men and women.

On Thursday, his administration finally suggested how: a 20 percent tax on products imported from south of the border. The new measure could be part of a comprehensive tax reform package that Trump and Congress will work out, the White House said. But there was great ambiguity about the proposal. White House officials later clarified that the tax was but one possible way Trump could finance the wall. Much was left unanswered. Would Mexico be footing the bill or American consumers? What items would become more expensive? Is this even legal? What impact will the Trump administration have on feds? Read the latest in our First 100 Days section. Some of the details Trump’s proposal still has to work out: Advertisement IS IT A TAX, A TARIFF OR SOMETHING ELSE? It’s unclear. The White House said Congress’ tax overhaul would place a 20 percent tax on imports from any country enjoying a trade surplus with the United States. In other words, countries selling more goods and service to the U.S. than buying from it. The idea is to rebalance the playing field for U.S. companies by discouraging Americans from importing. The idea appears to overlap with a plan House Republicans are pushing called “border adjustment.” Under this plan, the U.S. would refrain from taxing American companies’ exports, but would tax imports. The new revenues are projected to top $1 trillion over a decade. The money had been envisioned as an offset for lowering U.S. corporate income tax rates, though House Republicans say it could also pay for a wall. Trump, however, recently said he didn’t like the “border adjustment” idea. WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR AMERICANS? Mexican products would become more expensive. That means pricier tequila, but also things Americans need: cars, eyeglasses and many basic groceries. A Toyota Camry? About $1,000 more, according to Jim Lentz, CEO of Toyota North America, noting that a quarter of the car’s parts are imported. U.S. exporters are behind the House plan because it would reduce their taxes. Here’s the flip side: Importers, including big retailers and consumer electronics firms, say the higher prices for Mexican products could hurt sales. And that means American jobs. Retailers such as Wal-Mart also could face higher tax burdens. WOULD MEXICO REALLY BE PAYING? Not quite. The U.S. could recoup some of the wall’s costs by changing the tax and trade policies with Mexico. But the money wouldn’t necessarily be coming from Mexican taxpayers or the Mexican government. While the tax would land first on companies exporting from Mexico, the costs would likely be passed on to consumers. That leaves Americans footing much of the likely bill. Trump has said he’s OK with being “reimbursed” at a later point because he is keen to start building the wall immediately. WOULD IT RAISE ENOUGH MONEY TO PAY FOR THE WALL? Probably. Various estimates put the wall’s cost at up to $15 billion. House Republicans expect their plan to pull in much more than that in its first year. They say that could easily cover the costs of the wall. IS IT LEGAL? To be determined. The U.S. has a range of obligations under the North American Free Trade Agreement and at the World Trade Organization. And Mexico is likely to challenge any new tax that penalizes its economy. Trump has said he plans to renegotiate NAFTA. Mexico, however, is under no obligation to soften the agreement for his sake. Other countries may also object, if their products and services are targeted. Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, said the border adjustment is essentially a tariff that would be struck down by the WTO if it targets Mexico. HOW WOULD THIS AFFECT THE ECONOMY? A topic of great dispute. The White House said the plan would increase U.S. wages, help U.S. businesses and consumers, and deliver “huge economic benefits.” With so much of the plan ill-defined, it’s impossible to substantiate those claims. Any turbulence in the U.S.-Mexican trade relationship could have implications for the entire world. Mexico is the second-largest exporter to the United States, after China. The United States imported roughly $271 billion of goods from Mexico during the first 11 months of 2016, according to the Commerce Department, and ran a trade deficit of almost $60 billion. DO REPUBLICANS LIKE TRUMP’S PLAN? Not all of them. Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan said on Twitter it would be a “tax on Americans to pay for the wall.” Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said he was “mucho sad” and that “any policy proposal which drives up costs of Corona, tequila or margaritas is a big-time bad idea.” Even Trump’s pick for commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, dismissed the idea of using tariffs as a trade ploy. Republicans have traditionally hailed themselves as the party of free trade. WHAT OTHER WAYS COULD TRUMP GET MEXICO TO PAY? During the campaign, Trump floated a number of possibilities without committing to any in particular. He proposed changing a rule under the USA Patriot Act to block some of the roughly $25 billion in remittances that Mexicans living in the U.S. send home each year. He said he would refuse to free up the money until Mexico agrees to pay the U.S. between $5 billion and $10 billion. Opponents of that plan say Mexicans in the U.S. would likely find other ways to send money back. They could take cash with them when traveling, wire money to a non-Mexican bank or use off-the-books transfers that are difficult to police. Trump also suggested increasing visa fees for Mexicans to raise money, or canceling business and tourist visas issued to Mexicans until their country pays for the wall. ___ AP Business Writer Tom Krisher in Detroit and writers Erica Werner and Stephen Ohlemacher in Washington contributed to this report. ___ Reach Josh Boak on Twitter at http://twitter.com/joshboak Reach Josh Lederman on Twitter at http://twitter.com/joshledermanAP Topics: Business News Government News Leave A Comment Home » The Associated Press » Government News » How Trump's plan to… Partners FEDERAL INSIGHTS The Associated Press Government News U.S. News Business News World News Technology News Entertainment News Sports News Fed Photo of the Day Photos of the amazing, moving, important and amusing things happening in the federal community.

On Thursday, his administration finally suggested how: a 20 percent tax on products imported from south of the border. The new measure could be part of a comprehensive tax reform package that Trump and Congress will work out, the White House said. But there was great ambiguity about the proposal. White House officials later clarified that the tax was but one possible way Trump could finance the wall. Much was left unanswered. Would Mexico be footing the bill or American consumers? What items would become more expensive? Is this even legal? A man stops to read headlines, many featuring U.S. President Donald Trump's actions to jumpstart construction on a promised border wall and his insistence that Mexico will foot the bill, in Mexico City, Thursday, Jan. 26, 2017. Mexico's President Enrique Pena Nieto on Thursday cancelled a planned Jan. 31 meeting with Trump, hours after Trump tweeted that the meeting should be scrapped if Mexico won't pay for the wall.(AP Photo/Rebecca Blackwell) Some of the details Trump's proposal still has to work out: IS IT A TAX, A TARIFF OR SOMETHING ELSE?

But it would hurt Americans by Patrick Gillespie   @CNNMoney January 26, 2017: 6:19 PM ET Spicer: Tax on imports to fund border wall The Trump administration floated the idea of using a 20% tax on goods imported from Mexico to pay for the wall. The math works. The U.S. imported $303 billion from Mexico in 2015 and 20% of that is about $60 billion -- more than enough to pay for President Trump's wall on the border. But it's not that simple. American companies and consumers would bear the brunt of such a tariff. On Thursday, Trump's press secretary, Sean Spicer, told reporters that Trump would propose a 20% tariff on all goods shipped from Mexico to the U.S. to pay for the wall. The White House later clarified that it is just one option. Experts say a tariff would raise a mountain of concerns about U.S. jobs, the prices of products, and who actually pays for the wall. "The notion that a 20% tariff is a way of forcing Mexico to pay for the wall, it's just a falsehood. It's a way of forcing American consumers to pay for the wall," says Edward Alden a trade expert at the Council on Foreign Relations. Here's why. First, about 6 million U.S. jobs depend on trade with Mexico, according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Experts say those jobs would be jeopardized if Trump restricts trade with Mexico. Americans will very likely face higher prices for many things -- from cars and computers to avocados and Corona. A litany of products imported from Mexico would be more expensive. Companies from Ford (F) and GM (GM) to retailers like Walmart (WMT) and Best Buy (BBY) will likely be hit hard. Taxing Mexican imports affects many U.S. companies that send parts south of the border to be assembled. About 40% of the parts in a typical Mexican import originate in the United States. For example, before a car arrives at a local dealership, its parts criss-cross the U.S, Mexican and Canadian borders. It's how supply chains are used today. Related: 40% of a Mexican import is American There are other less obvious ways a blunt tariff could come back to bite Americans. Higher prices on some products mean that Americans would have less money to spend on others. That would end up costing jobs. That's what happened in 2009 after President Obama used tariffs on Chinese tires. It cost more jobs than it saved because prices for tires went up, one study found. And a Trump tariff would apply to many more products, so the ripple effects would be a lot broader. That brings us to who pays for the wall. When the U.S. government applies a tariff on Mexican goods shipped into the U.S., Mexican companies don't pay the tariff -- American companies pay it. Companies usually pass the increased cost of goods down to consumers, hence the higher price tag. So yes, a 20% tariff would pay for the wall. But Mexico would not be paying for it. American consumers would ultimately pay the price. Literally. Related: A new NAFTA deal could bring jobs back -- at a cost Mexico would suffer too. Its economy heavily relies on trade with the United States, and about 80% of all its exports go north of the border. A big tariff would discourage American firms from buying Mexican products. Trump's threats could just be a war of words to strong arm Mexico into paying for the border wall. Peter Navarro, who heads the White House National Trade Council, told CNNMoney during the campaign that the threat of a tariff would be a strategy to get Mexico into a better trade deal. Trump wants to renegotiate NAFTA, the free trade deal between Mexico, Canada and the U.S. The same logic could be applied to paying for the wall. "The tariff is not an end game, it's a strategy -- a strategy to renegotiate trade deals," Navarro said at the time. "Tariffs wouldn't put U.S. jobs at risk." If the tariff happens, the U.S. should expect Mexico to retaliate. Mexico's economy minister, Ildfonso Guajardo, said Mexico would respond immediately to any tariffs Trump imposes on Mexico. "It's very clear that we have to be prepared to immediately be able to neutralize the impact of a measure of that nature," Guajardo said on a Mexican news show that aired January 13. Guajardo added: A Trump tariff "will have a wave of impacts that can take us into a global recession."

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Friday, 27 January 2017 Jack Ma’s Ant Financial close to buying MoneyGram BEIJING: Ant Financial, the Alibaba affiliate controlled by billionaire Jack Ma, is close to sealing a deal to buy US money-transfer service MoneyGram International Inc, the Wall Street Journal reported citing people familiar with the matter. The newspaper didn’t disclose a price for the deal. Shares of Dallas-based MoneyGram closed yesterday at US$11.88, giving the company a market value of US$630mil. A deal would give China’s largest provider of online financial services a significant foothold in the US as it begins to explore markets beyond a home arena it already dominates. MoneyGram helps consumers and businesses move money around the world through hundreds of thousands of physical outlets. It’s partnered with Wal-Mart Stores Inc as the US retailer’s money-transfer agent, and also lets clients pay for everything from their mortgages to utility bills. Ant Financial, whose Alipay handles the majority of transactions on Alibaba Group Holding Ltd’s online shopping sites, last year appointed a new chief executive officer to steer its next phase of growth and possibly oversee a public market debut in 2017. Formally known as Zhejiang Ant Small & Micro Financial Services Group Co, the Chinese company has begun making investments abroad, notably in India and South-East Asia, to take its model of online finance and local services to emerging markets. Last year, executives of Ant Financial visited Silicon Valley to size up potential investments and lay the groundwork for an initial public offering. Ant spokeswoman Miranda Shek didn’t answer calls to her mobile phone. Ant started out as a unit of Alibaba before Ma spun it out in 2010, inviting objections from shareholders including Yahoo!

The seventh annual event will include expanded exhibitor and buyer platforms aimed at building greater opportunities for Central California food and beverage companies to connect and do business with retail and foodservice buyers. These efforts will continue to forge a path that will bring together the region’s food industry leaders to demonstrate, and bring recognition to, the depth and strength the region carries in the global food industry. Nearly 50% of the Expo show floor is already filled with returning exhibitors with more than 150 exhibitors and 950 key pre-qualified and domestic and international buyers expected to participate. Kicking-off in the spring as part of an expanded exhibitor platform, the Expo will host an exclusive exhibitor gathering that will invite all Central California food and beverage companies who have participated, or plan to participate in the Expo, to share in the value of a nationally-recognized business seminar. This first-time event will feature a keynote speaker that will address the needs of businesses throughout the region including topics such as professional leadership, training and motivation. Furthermore, the Expo will continue to include educational training opportunities for current exhibitors throughout the year on varying topics.   Through the Expo’s own awards programs, the region’s innovation will continue to be celebrated and recognized through the New Product Awards presented by Baker Peterson Franklin CPA, LLP, which has debuted over 160 new products from Valley-based companies since the showcase began in 2013. Most recent awards include the 2016 winners, Aubrey’s Jerky, made with real beef heart, who took home first place Buyer’s Choice Award category, and ARO Gourmet Pistachio’s, made with Himalayan Pink Salt, who took home the People’s Choice Award. Also returning to the Expo will be the Fred Ruiz Entrepreneurial Award. Named in honor of Fred Ruiz, founder of Ruiz Food Products, Inc., this award recognizes companies who have the same vision and qualities that took Ruiz Foods from a small, family start-up to the largest frozen Mexican food manufacturer in the United States. Lanna Coffee Co., a Fresno-based coffee company who sources its beans from Thailand to support economic stability in the villages where the beans are grown, was named the 2016 winner.   These award-winning exhibitors who represent some of the very best food and beverage companies in the nation, in addition to innovative, start-up companies that utilize the Fresno Food Expo platform to launch their businesses, continue to draw in buyers from around the world. Buyer participation is now five times more than the original participation number when the Expo began in 2011 – with the 2016 Fresno Food Expo drawing in over 900 local, national and international buyers, 77% of which had decision-making authority. Major retailers attending the show include ALDI, Costco Wholesale, Grocery Outlet, Safeway, Save Mart Supermarkets, Vallarta Supermarkets, Walmart and Whole Foods Market, along with international buyers hosted by the Center for International Trade Development, State Center Community College District as part of an organized buying mission tied to the regional food show.  As part of an effort to continue drawing in these types of decision-making buyers, the Expo touts an expanded buyer platform and will be bringing in a buyer-focused keynote speaker on July 26, the day prior to the tradeshow, who will discuss topics relevant to the retail, foodservice and distributor buying channels – another first-time initiative announced as part of this year’s event.  This year’s Buyer Agenda also includes exhibitor-hosted site tours and the Expo’s opening reception, Pairings, which offers an exclusive opportunity to make meaningful connections with our region’s leading food producers and attending buyers, complete with live cooking stations that will put a spotlight on the region’s most celebrated chefs. “Now in its seventh year, the Fresno Food Expo has helped elevate public perception of the award-winning Central California food region and put a spotlight on our diverse food industry companies who have been recognized by their peers on state, national and international platforms,” said David Nalchajian, General Manager of the Fresno Food Expo. “To further support and create new pathways for our region’s food industry companies to become recognized leaders and innovators within the food industry, the Expo is excited to launch, and further develop a year-round network that fosters business growth opportunities for companies both big and small.” In order to further highlight the award-winning region and tell the story behind the region’s food companies, the Expo will begin hosting its own blog and develop a voice representative of Central California’s thriving food industry.  A collaborative group of top food industry leaders will continue to lead the Fresno Food Expo as a Board of Directors serving in various advisory capacities including Chairwoman of the Board Ashley Swearengin, President & CEO of the Central Valley Community Foundation; Vice Chairwoman of the Board, Agnes Saghatelian, President of Valley Lahvosh Baking Company; Board Secretary, Vincent Ricchiuti, Director of Operations for Enzo Olive Oil Company; Board Treasurer, Denver Schutz, Technical Services Manager of Gerawan Farming; Mark Ford, President of JD Food; Mike Grazier, President of Busseto Foods; Helen Chavez-Hansen, Owner and President of La Tapatia Tortilleria, Inc.; Jimmy Maxey, Chairman of Certified Meat Products; Chuck Nichols, President of Nichols Farms; Rod Noll, Vice President of the Western Region for US Cold Storage; Justin Parnagian, Sales Director for Fowler Packing Company; Fred Ruiz, Co-Founder and Chairman Emeritus of Ruiz Foods; and Bill Smittcamp, President & CEO of Wawona Frozen Foods. The tradeshow portion of the Expo will take place during the day on Thursday, July 27, followed by the public celebration, Expolicious, filled with sampling and discovery taking place that evening. Registration forms and additional information for exhibitors and buyers are available at www.FresnoFoodExpo.com. Exhibitors can take advantage of early bird discounts, a 30% savings available through February 1, with tickets for Expolicious going on sale in May. About Fresno Food Expo: Originally developed as an economic development initiative by the City of Fresno in 2011, the Expo has since emerged as the nation’s only exclusively regional food show bringing together growers, processors, manufacturers and industry service providers with buyers from around the world. Since its debut, the Expo has brought heightened awareness to the region’s food production industry as new, innovative businesses emerge and industry collaborations form as a direct result of the show. The Expo has introduced 305 different food and beverage companies to new customers and hosted 2,680 different qualified buyers, including over 100 strategically recruited international buyers.

MUST CREDIT: Photo for The Washington Post by Oliver Contreras Oliver Contreras, For The Washington Post .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... ..........American University announced Thursday that a former top Obama administration official, Sylvia Mathews Burwell, will become its 15th president and the first woman to lead the school in the nation’s capital. Burwell, 51, was director of the Office of Management and Budget under President Barack Obama in 2013-2014 and then secretary of health and human services until his term ended last week. Her Cabinet post put Burwell on the front lines of overseeing the implementation of Obama’s signature health care law. She will take over at AU on June 1, succeeding retiring university President Cornelius “Neil” Kerwin. “My family and I are honored and excited to become a part of this vibrant AU community,” Burwell said in a statement. “American University’s distinctive mix of academic strengths, its influential scholars, engaged students, successful alumni and extraordinary location are great assets.” Burwell’s jump to academia echoes in some ways a move that one of her government predecessors made 16 years ago. Donna Shalala, secretary of health and human services under President Bill Clinton, was named president of the University of Miami in 2001 and led that school for 14 years. Advertisement Continue reading But Shalala had extensive academic credentials before her time at HHS, including a doctorate and stints as a tenured professor and then leader of a public college in New York and of the public flagship University of Wisconsin at Madison. Burwell’s background is much different. She earned a bachelor’s degree in government from Harvard University and then, as a Rhodes Scholar, a bachelor’s in philosophy, politics and economics from the University of Oxford. But she does not have a master’s degree or doctorate and has never been a professor or provost. AU, a private institution with 13,000 students and a main campus in Washington, D.C., will be the first college or university that she leads. Burwell has other credentials of immense value for a university that aspires to excellence in public and international affairs: deep experience working for two Democratic presidents in Washington and two major national philanthropies. She had various posts in the Clinton administration and was president of global development programs for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and was president of the Walmart Foundation. Those connections should help her in fund-raising and in growing AU’s national profile. Crucially, her fans are bipartisan. Unlike many Obama administration officials, who had testy relations with Capitol Hill, Burwell made a point of cultivating ties with Republicans who had jurisdiction over her department. During hearings this month for her designated successor at HHS, Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga., lawmakers made a point of praising Burwell. Sen. Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., told the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee that “one of the best votes I cast four years ago for Cabinet members was a vote for Sylvia Burwell.” Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., chairman of the committee, who was once president of the University of Tennessee, told The Washington Post in a statement: “Sylvia Burwell will make an excellent president of American University — she listens well, she has a strong sense of public purpose, and she is gifted academically.” Advertisement Continue reading Burwell, originally from Hinton, West Virginia, often refers to her small-town roots. She joked in one interview that she and former agriculture secretary Tom Vilsack were one of the two “rural” members of the Cabinet. She traveled back to West Virginia regularly, saying those experiences helped inform her approach to addressing the nation’s opioid crisis. Former Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., now on the faculty of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, said Burwell has a “compelling personal narrative” and predicted she will excel at AU. “She knows the power of what a university means in a person’s life and in the life of the community and in the country,” Mikulski said. “She brings savvy and know-how. … She really has the right stuff.” Founded in 1893, AU is affiliated with the United Methodist Church. It is known as a center of political activism and has schools of law, business, public affairs and international service, among other fields. The university has grown more selective in recent years, drawing applicants interested in studying in a city with an increasingly vibrant urban culture and a huge network of federal, international and nonprofit agencies. The admission rate for the class that entered AU in 2016 was 26 percent, down from 35 percent the year before. As recently as 2009, the rate was 53 percent. The school ranks 74th on the U.S. News and World Report list of national universities, tied with Clark University, Texas A&M University, Virginia Tech and the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. The incumbent president at AU, Kerwin, has led the school since 2005. He announced his retirement last March. Under Kerwin, the university launched major renovations and expansions of its campus, and its endowment stood at about $600 million in 2015. Burwell said in a telephone interview that she looks forward to building on Kerwin’s record. “The whole organization is ready to take the next steps forward,” she said. “It is a place that embraces innovation and change.” AU is the second university in the District of Columbia this year to name a new president. Thomas LeBlanc, provost of the University of Miami, will become George Washington University’s president in July. — Juliet Eilperin contributed to this report.

Democrat and Chronicle Published 2:15 p.m. ET Jan. 26, 2017 | Updated 4:08 p.m. ET Jan. 26, 2017 CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share Federal law enforcement talk about the sentencing of ISIL sympathizer Emanuel Lutchman and Lutchman's courtroom outburst after Lutchman's sentencing. Tina MacIntyre-Yee Emanuel Lutchman, who pleaded guilty in August 2016 to conspiracy to provide material support to a foreign terrorism organization, was sentenced Thursday, Jan. 26, 2017, to 20 years in prison. He was accused of planning a terror attack in Rochester on New Year's Eve 2015. (Photo: Carlos Ortiz, Rochester (N.Y.) Democrat and Chronicle) ROCHESTER, N.Y. — Before he planned to attack patrons at a New York bar in an Islamic State-inspired crime, Emanuel Lutchman had another plot: He would kill his wife. The FBI had not planned to arrest Lutchman on Dec. 30, 2015, when it did — a day before Lutchman intended to wield a machete and attack New Year's Eve patrons at a Rochester, N.Y., bar. But agents learned Lutchman had told an FBI informant that he wanted to kill his wife — Lutchman had earlier been convicted of menacing her — and agents believed they had to intervene for the woman's safety. "We were getting worried that he was taking serious steps" to find his wife, FBI Special Agent Joseph Testani said Thursday, after Lutchman was sentenced to 20 years for conspiring to assist the terrorist organization, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, also known as ISIL or ISIS. USA TODAY Man pleads guilty in plot to attack New York bar On Thursday, U.S.District Judge Frank Geraci Jr. sentenced Lutchman, 26, to the maximum sentence of 20 years. Only moments before, Lutchman had tearfully apologized to the court and his family. He said he had renounced ISIL and its plans to violently establish a caliphate in the Middle East. But once Geraci imposed the sentence, Lutchman turned angry and defiant. "You think because I'm going to be incarcerated there aren't going to be more of us that rise up," Lutchman said, his voice rising. Geraci responded calmly, saying that Lutchman apparently still adhered to ISIL's tenets, despite his assertions to the contrary. "Yes I do," Lutchman answered. "… There's going to be more of us." For prosecutors and police, the outburst was evidence of Lutchman's danger. A man who has struggled with mental illness for much of his life, Lutchman has been portrayed by family and supporters as a fragile individual who was hand-held into the terrorist plot by an FBI informant. But Lutchman's anger, which included shouts and rants in Arabic, were proof of his "true colors," said assistant U.S. Attorney Brett Harvey, the prosecutor in the case. At Lutchman's sentencing Thursday, Harvey detailed how Lutchman had initiated contact with a Syria-based ISIL recruiter, who directed Lutchman to commit a crime on U.S. soil. USA TODAY N.Y. terror suspect pledged allegiance to Islamic State A felon who'd been imprisoned for robbery, Lutchman could not buy a gun. So he decided to attack the patrons at Merchants Grill in Rochester with a machete and knives, and possibly take some hostages, authorities say. "He's a zealous and ardent supporter of the Islamic State," Harvey said. “You think because I'm going to be incarcerated there aren't going to be more of us that rise up.”Emanuel Lutchman Lutchman recorded a video in which he told of his planned New Year's Eve assault. He'd been told to create the video by the recruiter for ISIL, and the Islamic State aimed to use it for propaganda, Harvey said. At sentencing, Lutchman's attorney,  Steven Slawinski, an assistant federal public defender, highlighted Lutchman's mental health problems, including bipolar disorder, depression and suicidal ideations. Lutchman, who often panhandled in the same neighborhood as the Merchants Grill, was so destitute that the FBI informant accompanied him to Walmart on Dec. 29, 2015, and spent $40 to buy the machete, knives and zip ties that Lutchman intended to use in his attack. "The risk of danger here is exaggerated by the government," said Slawinski, who had argued in court papers for a 10-year sentence for Lutchman. Lutchman's anger toward his wife was not mentioned in court, or in court papers. But, in an interview after the sentencing, FBI agent Testani said law enforcement arrested him when they did because of Lutchman's comments that he wanted to seek out his wife and kill her. USA TODAY FBI wanted terror suspect as informant, grandma says The wife, who has a 2-year-old son with Lutchman, had an order of protection against him. The FBI and other members of the regional Joint Terrorism Task Force were preparing the legal papers to arrest Lutchman and head off the New Year's Eve plot when they learned that he'd told the informant of his murderous intentions toward his wife.

The informant, who had been working with the FBI, was able to connect with Lutchman. Agents arrested Lutchman in a car with the informant. Lutchman was "intent on doing it ... and irrational," Testani said of Lutchman's desire to kill his wife. Lutchman pleaded guilty in August to providing "material support" to a terrorist organization —  a sweeping law designed to battle terrorism in the United States. USA TODAY N.Y. terrorism cases likely shared same informant In court Thursday, Geraci acknowledged Lutchman's mental struggles, but said that same psychological fragility "also created a real danger in this community." Lutchman's ISIL-motivated video, in which he told how he intended to attack the Merchants Grill, was proof of his seriousness to carry out the crime, Geraci said. "That video ... indicates that this was the real deal," Geraci said. "People were going to die at the Merchants Grill on New Year's Eve, but for the intervention of law enforcement." As U.S. Marshals Service deputies removed Lutchman from court after his eruption, he shouted back at Geraci, "(Expletive) you!" An unfazed Geraci responded, "Motion denied."

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied 0.8 per cent overnight to pass 20,000 points for the first time on hopes for faster United States growth. Investors here responded by sending the Straits Times Index up 0.39 per cent, or 11.84 points, to 3,051.78. Local stocks were driven by gains in Keppel Corp and property counters in anticipation of fund managers repositioning their portfolios if warehouse operator Global Logistic Properties (GLP) is acquired, DBS Group Research said. Traders have been speculating about a GLP takeover since last November while the firm said earlier this month that it is in preliminary discussions with various parties. The talk helped push developer CDL up 2.3 per cent or 21 cents to $9.17 while UOL rose 0.9 per cent or six cents to $6.51. CapitaLand gained 1.9 per cent or six cents to $3.27. Keppel rose 1.9 per cent or 12 cents to $6.39, ahead of fourth-quarter earnings released after market close yesterday. Net profit fell 64.7 per cent to $143 million while revenue dropped 22 per cent to $1.94 billion. Yesterday's most actively traded counters included Equation Summit, which plunged 21.9 per cent or 0.7 cent to 2.5 cents, with 508.1 million shares traded. This came after its subsidiary Disa Digital Safety retracted an announcement on the roll-out of its digital lock technology at all of retail giant Walmart's stores in America. Equation said it regrets the release of the announcement without Walmart's consent. Thai Beverage was another active, ending flat at 84.5 cents on trade of 49.8 million shares. "With advertising efforts likely to resume this year, operating conditions should gradually recover for the company," according to OCBC Investment Research. Other actively traded counters included Artivision Tech, which surged 18.8 per cent or 0.3 cent to 1.9 cents, with 130.8 million shares traded, and Noble Group, which was flat at 17.2 cents with 74.5 million shares changing hands. Sen Yue Holdings, formerly known as PNE Micron, gained 6.9 per cent or 0.2 cent to 3.1 cents, with 35.3 million shares traded. Sheng Siong shares jumped 0.5 per cent or 0.5 cent to 93 cents, after UOB KayHian upgraded its call to buy from hold, noting that smaller supermarkets have driven up prices for HDB commercial units. "If smaller players are unable to keep up with the high rent, big players (like Sheng Siong) may have an opportunity to secure units at more reasonable rates," the broker said. Keppel Telecommunications & Transportation fell nine cents to $1.675 after fourth-quarter profit tumbled 93 per cent on lower fair value gains on data centre investment properties and a smaller profit share from associates.

Skip to content Military Technologies pr@satprnews.com HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Main Menu Former HHS Secretary Burwell Is American University’s Next President 26 January 2017Military News Photo of Sylvia Mathews Burell courtesy hhs.gov. I welcome the opportunity to help AU expand its scholarly influence, enhance the student experience, and be a model for inclusion and innovation at a time when these ideals are vitally important,” Burwell said. Washington DC (PRWEB) January 26, 2017 Sylvia Mathews Burwell, who was most recently the Secretary of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) under former President Barack Obama, has been named the 15th President of American University in Washington, DC. She succeeds Neil Kerwin as president and will assume her responsibilities on June 1, 2017. Burwell, the first woman to hold the highest leadership position at AU, emerged as the top candidate in a very competitive national search. “Secretary Burwell’s success at HHS reflects three key abilities that will make her an excellent president for our university. She fosters research and scholarship, and turns them into action. She embraces and leverages the strengths of a large, diverse institution to advance its goals, and she is able to convey complex ideas to a wide range of audiences, from members of congress to the public, in pushing for evidence-based actions and outcomes,” said Kiho Kim, professor of environmental science at AU and a member of the Presidential Search Committee. “My family and I are honored and excited to become a part of this vibrant AU community,” Burwell said. “American University’s distinctive mix of academic strengths, its influential scholars, engaged students, successful alumni and extraordinary location are great assets.” Burwell comes to AU after having served as the 22nd Secretary of HHS, a role she held from 2014 through the end of President Obama’s second term. Prior to that Cabinet appointment, Burwell was Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), also a Cabinet position. A Leader of Immense Character and Vision An accomplished senior government official and global foundation executive, Burwell is a leader of immense character and vision, known for her rigor of thought and laser-like focus on mission. A Rhodes Scholar, she possesses an inherent intellectual curiosity that she has applied to push the boundaries of knowledge in order to address complex problems. “These traits, combined with her experience and commitment to education and research, make her well-suited to lead AU at this moment in our history, as we build on the momentum and progress achieved in recent years,” said Jack Cassell, Chairman of AU’s Board of Trustees. Burwell has managed large and complex organizations across the public and private sector. Her career reflects strategic thought leadership at the highest levels of U.S. government, and global executive leadership at two of the world’s largest and most well-known non-profit and corporate foundations. Prior to her roles in the Obama Administration, she was President of the Walmart Foundation, where she led efforts to fight hunger in America, empower women around the world and improve local communities. Previously, she served at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation for a decade as Chief Operating Officer and then as the founding President of the Gates Foundation’s Global Development Program, where she helped advance solutions to some of the world’s most pressing global public health issues. University of Pennsylvania President Emerita and Rockefeller Foundation President, Judith Rodin, said, “I applaud the American University community on this outstanding appointment. Sylvia Burwell is a visionary, strategic and talented leader with an unmatched drive for excellence. She loves learning and rigorous debate, and has a passion for engaging people, from students to scholars, in the critical issues of the day. All of these qualities make her perfect for a 21st Century university presidency.” “Given the challenges facing higher education, our nation, and our world, I think there is no better time for American University to assert its considerable strengths, to lead and convene thought leaders, and take on the world’s thorniest problems. I welcome the opportunity to help AU expand its scholarly influence, enhance the student experience, and be a model for inclusion and innovation at a time when these ideals are vitally important,” Burwell said. During her recent government tenure, HHS advanced the most comprehensive reform of the nation’s health care system in a generation; confronted urgent public health issues, such as the opioid crisis; through the Centers for Disease Control, addressed the Zika and Ebola outbreaks; and at the National Institutes of Health, supported advancements at the forefront of biomedical research. At OMB, she helped lead the negotiations that won a landmark two-year budget agreement. Burwell also held leadership roles in the Clinton Administration, including as Deputy Chief of Staff to the President and Chief of Staff to the U.S. Secretary of Treasury. She has served on the boards of the Council on Foreign Relations, MetLife, and the University of Washington Medical center, among other organizations. Burwell earned an A.B. in Government from Harvard University, and earned a BA in Philosophy, Policy and Economics from the University of Oxford. She is married and has two children. A Transformed Institution Burwell inherits a university on a remarkable ascent over the last decade. During Neil Kerwin’s tenure, AU has experienced the most intensive period of transformation in its history—both in prestige and in physical space. AU research, as classified by the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education, improved to the level “Doctoral: Higher Research Activity,” placing it in the company of research from institutions such as Dartmouth College and William and Mary. This resulted from strategic decisions to expand the number of doctoral programs and increase externally funded research productivity. AU became more selective, dramatically reducing its admission rate to 26 percent, the lowest in school history. The university more than doubled the amount of need-based financial aid and has seen a 21 percent decrease in average student debt for graduates with loans. Initiatives to personalize and integrate student services across campus and to better cultivate diversity and inclusion aim to make AU feel like home for all students. The most visible indication of AU’s transformation over the past 10 years is the more than 1.5 million new and/or renovated square feet of teaching, learning and residence hall space on main campus and the Washington College of Law’s new Tenley Campus. “AU’s trajectory over the last decade enables us to leverage our strengths and think in bold, ambitious ways,” Burwell said. What others say about Sylvia Burwell “She’s a proven manager who’s demonstrated her ability to build great teams, forge strong relationships and deliver excellent results at the highest levels and she’s done it both in the public and the private sectors.” — President Barack Obama (in remarks to announce her nomination as HHS Secretary) “Sylvia’s done a great job of helping us build a world-class organization and created a transformative grant-making program that is helping millions of poor people around the world. She put our global development work on a path to success, and we look forward to building on it.” — Bill Gates, co-chairman of the Gates Foundation (quote from a 2012 press release announcing Burwell’s departure) “Given recent events in our nation and on our campus, there is a not a more vital time in higher education for tested, strategic, and inclusive leadership. Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell has an extensive background that embodies all of these traits. Secretary Burwell has tackled our nation’s most difficult problems through her career in public service, and I am fully confident that she will bring this same care and effectiveness to the student experience at American University.” — Shyheim Snead, AU Student Trustee and Frederick Douglass Distinguished Scholar “Sylvia Mathews Burwell is a unique breed of leader that will combine seamlessly her experience managing complex institutions with her deeply held appreciation that our university’s greatest asset is our people: the students, alumni, faculty, and staff. I am confident that under her leadership, AU’s trajectory, by every measure, is about to enter a new orbit.” –Andrea Agathoklis Murino, Partner, Goodwin Procter, LLP President, American University Alumni Association -AU- American University is a leader in global education, enrolling a diverse student body from throughout the United States and nearly 140 countries. Located in Washington, D.C., the university provides opportunities for academic excellence, public service, and internships in the nation’s capital and around the world.

Doughnuts from Valhalla Bakery, which will now be featured at its sister shop, Valkyrie Doughnuts near UCF. (Lauren Delgado / Orlando Sentinel) Kyle Arnold A favorite Orlando bakery is bringing its signature decadent doughnuts to a shopping center next to UCF. Valhalla Bakery is opening another Viking-themed business, Valkyrie Donuts, near UCF as a stand-alone shop. It should open early next week, owner Celine Duvoisin said.  The new doughnut shop is at 12226 Corporate Blvd. in Orlando, the same complex as Sus Hi Eatstation and Dollar Tree off Alafaya Trail. Valhalla, on the other hand, opened in 2014 at the Market on South food hub near downtown, making cakes, cupcakes, bread and other vegan dishes. “We didn’t want to open too close to Valhalla and cannibalize our business,” Duvoisin said. “And then we looked at UCF; it’s a great area.” The shop will specialize in the vegan-friendly cake doughnuts. They are often topped with treats such as Fruity Pebbles, pistachios or blueberry icing. It will also expand Duvoisin’s doughnut-making capacity greatly, with a fryer that can make 24 pastries at a time and run all day if necessary.

Retired NBA star Ray Allen and wife Shannon are opening their third Grown restaurant location in mid-February at the big-box store. Grown is dubbed as a “certified organic” fast-food restaurant. The menu features juices, smoothies and dishes such as salads, sandwiches with rotisserie chicken or slow-roasted brisket. “Due to [Wal-Mart’s] immense customer base and buying power, they can not only support local farmers as they make the switch from conventional to organically grown farms, but, also help drive down the cost of organic for consumers everywhere,” said a statement from Shannon Allen, who also hosts a cooking show about healthy eating. When it opens, the restaurant hours will be from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. Debra Howard and son Nick Howard of Orlando leave the West Oaks Mall after holiday shpping, on Tuesday, December 18, 2007.

A targeted approach has been prescribed for reviving growth, by identifying "big-ticket" items. The sector's growth fell to 6.6 per cent in 2012-13, shows the government's advanced estimates, compared against a growth of 8.2 per cent in the previous year. Retailing, construction and telecom would perform better, triggered by some reforms and a mild relaxation in monetary and credit policy, it says. Growth in tourism and hotels, however, could remain moderate. It has named several international chains to drive home the point that foreign direct investment in retailing is a positive for the economy. The food and beverages segment is seeing increased activity from foreign players, it says. The cash-and-carry or wholesale category is growing fast, "with significant expansion planned from Bharti Walmart, Metro Group and Carrefour". Also, Zara, Marks & Spencer and Mango are actively looking for locations to open more stores. In real estate, India ranks 182nd in construction permission processes, the survey says, citing a World Bank report. "There are 34 procedures and the average time taken is 196 days, which increases the sale value by 40 per cent." The Survey points at procedural delays, along with rapid increase in land prices, absence of long-term funding, low floor to area ratio permitted in cities, high stamp duties and a dearth of affordable housing as issues needing to be addressed. Some of these might find a place in tomorrow's Budget. The Survey suggests greater emphasis on super-speciality healthcare as an area with promise. Telemedicine is another.   "Tourism is a big-ticket item, which can not only lead to higher growth but also more inclusive growth." With world tourist arrivals expected to increase by 43 million every year, a gold mine of opportunity in tourism is waiting for India, it says. India has a share of just 0.64 per cent in world tourist arrivals. Indian tourism must go for an image change, along with higher investment in infrastructure through private-public partnerships. User charges could be levied if tourist sites are developed by the private sector or through PPP. Also, there is a need to address issues such as the high luxury taxes on hotels by states. "Refunding VAT (value added tax) as done in Thailand and Singapore can also help the tourism sector," it says. The share of services (including construction) in gross domestic product in 2012-13, shows the Advance Estimates, is 64.8 per cent.

About Future Staff Contact Privacy Policy Search for: Select Press Releases Home / Press Releases / Former HHS Secretary Burwell Is American University’s Next President Former HHS Secretary Burwell Is American University’s Next President Posted on January 26, 2017 by Top News US Full Feed in Press Releases Conceptual image of a businessman holding big hammer Obama Cabinet Member Is First Woman to Lead AU Washington DC (PRWEB) January 26, 2017 Sylvia Mathews Burwell, who was most recently the Secretary of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) under former President Barack Obama, has been named the 15th President of American University in Washington, DC. She succeeds Neil Kerwin as president and will assume her responsibilities on June 1, 2017. Burwell, the first woman to hold the highest leadership position at AU, emerged as the top candidate in a very competitive national search. “Secretary Burwell’s success at HHS reflects three key abilities that will make her an excellent president for our university. She fosters research and scholarship, and turns them into action. She embraces and leverages the strengths of a large, diverse institution to advance its goals, and she is able to convey complex ideas to a wide range of audiences, from members of congress to the public, in pushing for evidence-based actions and outcomes,” said Kiho Kim, professor of environmental science at AU and a member of the Presidential Search Committee. “My family and I are honored and excited to become a part of this vibrant AU community,” Burwell said. “American University’s distinctive mix of academic strengths, its influential scholars, engaged students, successful alumni and extraordinary location are great assets.” Burwell comes to AU after having served as the 22nd Secretary of HHS, a role she held from 2014 through the end of President Obama’s second term. Prior to that Cabinet appointment, Burwell was Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), also a Cabinet position. A Leader of Immense Character and Vision An accomplished senior government official and global foundation executive, Burwell is a leader of immense character and vision, known for her rigor of thought and laser-like focus on mission. A Rhodes Scholar, she possesses an inherent intellectual curiosity that she has applied to push the boundaries of knowledge in order to address complex problems. “These traits, combined with her experience and commitment to education and research, make her well-suited to lead AU at this moment in our history, as we build on the momentum and progress achieved in recent years,” said Jack Cassell, Chairman of AU’s Board of Trustees. Burwell has managed large and complex organizations across the public and private sector. Her career reflects strategic thought leadership at the highest levels of U.S. government, and global executive leadership at two of the world’s largest and most well-known non-profit and corporate foundations. Prior to her roles in the Obama Administration, she was President of the Walmart Foundation, where she led efforts to fight hunger in America, empower women around the world and improve local communities. Previously, she served at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation for a decade as Chief Operating Officer and then as the founding President of the Gates Foundation’s Global Development Program, where she helped advance solutions to some of the world’s most pressing global public health issues. University of Pennsylvania President Emerita and Rockefeller Foundation President, Judith Rodin, said, “I applaud the American University community on this outstanding appointment. Sylvia Burwell is a visionary, strategic and talented leader with an unmatched drive for excellence. She loves learning and rigorous debate, and has a passion for engaging people, from students to scholars, in the critical issues of the day. All of these qualities make her perfect for a 21st Century university presidency.” “Given the challenges facing higher education, our nation, and our world, I think there is no better time for American University to assert its considerable strengths, to lead and convene thought leaders, and take on the world’s thorniest problems. I welcome the opportunity to help AU expand its scholarly influence, enhance the student experience, and be a model for inclusion and innovation at a time when these ideals are vitally important,” Burwell said. During her recent government tenure, HHS advanced the most comprehensive reform of the nation’s health care system in a generation; confronted urgent public health issues, such as the opioid crisis; through the Centers for Disease Control, addressed the Zika and Ebola outbreaks; and at the National Institutes of Health, supported advancements at the forefront of biomedical research. At OMB, she helped lead the negotiations that won a landmark two-year budget agreement. Burwell also held leadership roles in the Clinton Administration, including as Deputy Chief of Staff to the President and Chief of Staff to the U.S. Secretary of Treasury. She has served on the boards of the Council on Foreign Relations, MetLife, and the University of Washington Medical center, among other organizations. Burwell earned an A.B. in Government from Harvard University, and earned a BA in Philosophy, Policy and Economics from the University of Oxford. She is married and has two children. A Transformed Institution Burwell inherits a university on a remarkable ascent over the last decade. During Neil Kerwin’s tenure, AU has experienced the most intensive period of transformation in its history—both in prestige and in physical space. AU research, as classified by the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education, improved to the level “Doctoral: Higher Research Activity,” placing it in the company of research from institutions such as Dartmouth College and William and Mary. This resulted from strategic decisions to expand the number of doctoral programs and increase externally funded research productivity. AU became more selective, dramatically reducing its admission rate to 26 percent, the lowest in school history. The university more than doubled the amount of need-based financial aid and has seen a 21 percent decrease in average student debt for graduates with loans. Initiatives to personalize and integrate student services across campus and to better cultivate diversity and inclusion aim to make AU feel like home for all students. The most visible indication of AU’s transformation over the past 10 years is the more than 1.5 million new and/or renovated square feet of teaching, learning and residence hall space on main campus and the Washington College of Law’s new Tenley Campus. “AU’s trajectory over the last decade enables us to leverage our strengths and think in bold, ambitious ways,” Burwell said. What others say about Sylvia Burwell “She’s a proven manager who’s demonstrated her ability to build great teams, forge strong relationships and deliver excellent results at the highest levels and she’s done it both in the public and the private sectors.” — President Barack Obama (in remarks to announce her nomination as HHS Secretary) “Sylvia’s done a great job of helping us build a world-class organization and created a transformative grant-making program that is helping millions of poor people around the world. She put our global development work on a path to success, and we look forward to building on it.” — Bill Gates, co-chairman of the Gates Foundation (quote from a 2012 press release announcing Burwell’s departure) “Given recent events in our nation and on our campus, there is a not a more vital time in higher education for tested, strategic, and inclusive leadership. Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell has an extensive background that embodies all of these traits. Secretary Burwell has tackled our nation’s most difficult problems through her career in public service, and I am fully confident that she will bring this same care and effectiveness to the student experience at American University.” — Shyheim Snead, AU Student Trustee and Frederick Douglass Distinguished Scholar “Sylvia Mathews Burwell is a unique breed of leader that will combine seamlessly her experience managing complex institutions with her deeply held appreciation that our university's greatest asset is our people: the students, alumni, faculty, and staff. I am confident that under her leadership, AU's trajectory, by every measure, is about to enter a new orbit.” –Andrea Agathoklis Murino, Partner, Goodwin Procter, LLP President, American University Alumni Association -AU- American University is a leader in global education, enrolling a diverse student body from throughout the United States and nearly 140 countries. Located in Washington, D.C., the university provides opportunities for academic excellence, public service, and internships in the nation’s capital and around the world.

Kelly Schneider, 23, acknowledges in court documents he lured victim Steven Nelson to a remote area and used steel-toed boots to kick Nelson roughly two-dozen times while Nelson begged for his life. The plea agreement document filed in Boise’s U.S. District Court on Wednesday outlines the details of the crime. On April 27, 2016, according to the document, Schneider posted a solicitation for sex on Backpage.com, along with a shirtless photo of himself. Nelson responded to the posting, and the two met that same night. Though Schneider took Nelson’s money, the two didn’t engage in any sexual acts, according to the plea agreement. “Before the encounter, the defendant told his friends that he was not gay and would not let anyone who was gay touch him,” U.S. Attorney Wendy Olson wrote in the plea agreement. Schneider contacted Nelson and agreed to meet him at a local Wal-Mart parking lot. There, he asked Nelson to drive to an isolated wildlife area outside of town for a romantic encounter. Unbeknownst to Nelson, however, Schneider planned a robbery and had two of friends lying in wait at the wildlife area in case Nelson resisted. Schneider began beating Nelson as soon as they arrived, and Nelson never resisted, according to the plea agreement. Instead, he volunteered his ATM number and begged for his life, saying, “Please don’t kill me. Take whatever you want,” Olson wrote. As Schneider’s friends remained hidden, Schneider kicked and beat Nelson while taunting him with a gay slur. Then he stripped Nelson and left him at the wildlife area, driving away in Nelson’s car. Despite being critically injured, Nelson managed to make it to a house about a half-mile away to get help. He was able to describe the attack to police before he died in a hospital a few hours later. Prosecutors have agreed to ask a judge to sentence Schneider to 28 years in prison, to be served at the same time as any sentence Schneider gets in Idaho state court, where he has already pleaded guilty to Nelson’s murder. Nelson faces up to life in prison on the state murder charge. Three other men – Jayson Woods, 28; Kevin R. Tracy, 21; and Daniel Henkel, 23 – have also been charged with murder in state court in connection with Nelson’s death. They’re awaiting trial.   Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

The group is offering 'loads of hope' to those affected.  "Load of Hope' allows families devastated by disaster to clean two loads of clothes.  "It’s a devastating situation here, and we just have personal items, cleaning items, that we’re giving to people out here in need," Ben WIlliams with Matthew 25 ministries said.   The group set up shop in the Walmart parking lot on Highway 49. Volunteers offered to wash the loads of clothes while others took to the streets to clean debris.  "The response has been great," Williams said. "People have been really excited to see us, they’ve shown a lot of gratitude, they’ve been thrilled with the supplies we’ve been able to provide for them." The lost look on the faces of families displaced after natural catastrophes is one Williams has seen several times. "You know the emotion that people have here in so many different situations they are certainly sad and upset about the situation," said Williams. "It’s such a stressful time losing everything that they have, so we want to bring some hope along with us." Williams hopes that the act of cleaning clothes allows victims some peace of mind.  "We like to give them a smile, maybe a hug if they need it," Williams said. "Show them that somebody cares at such a difficult time like this." Copyright WDAM 2017.

Markeith Loyd, 41, appeared in an Orlando courtroom after telling the judge last week that he wanted to represent himself. He faces 11 charges, including two counts of first-degree murder, attempted first-degree murder and killing of an unborn child by injury to the mother. Authorities accuse Loyd of fatally shooting his pregnant ex-wife Sade Dixon and wounding her brother during a domestic dispute on Dec. 13. Markeith Loyd, suspected of fatally shooting a Florida police officer, attends a court appearance, Friday, Jan. 20, 2017, at the Orange County Jail in Orlando, Fla. Red Huber / Orlando Sentinel via AP Orlando police Master Sgt. Debra Clayton, 42, was shot and killed by Loyd after she responded to a sighting of him near a Walmart on Jan. 9. Orange County Sheriff's Deputy Norman Lewis was also killed in a crash as authorities pursued Loyd. Judge Frederick Lauten ruled Thursday that Loyd was competent to waive his right to counsel and represent himself after a series of questions in which Loyd often looked down and refused to respond . Related: Accused Orlando Cop Killer Markeith Loyd Makes First Court Appearance, Goes on Profane Tirade Loyd wore a bandage over his head covering his left eye in court, due to injuries sustained during his arrest, but answered a few basic questions including his age and level of education.

But Lauten urged Loyd to consider having an appointed attorney as the possible punishments he faces could be "life in prison or execution by lethal injection or otherwise." Orlando Police Master Sgt. Debra Clayton is pictured in an image released by the Orlando Police. Orlando Police Department "I hope you'll carefully consider what we talked about and I would urge you to consider having a lawyer represent you," he warned. The ruling comes after one week after Loyd launched into a profanity laced tirade in court as he was ordered held on no bond. "Y'all making up (expletive) like I just went in there and shot this girl," Loyd ranted in front of the judge on Jan. 19, referring to ex-girlfriend Sade Dixon. The judge said Loyd could be denied the right to represent himself in a trial if he engaged in such outbursts or other aggressive behavior.

(WIVB) — New York State Police have arrested three men allegedly connected with a number of incidents involving the theft of credit card information. Skimmers, which are small devices, can be installed on gas pumps, self-checkout devices or ATMs. The devices scan and store credit card data. People using things like gas pumps and ATMs cannot see them. Florida residents Yordani Ramirez-Salgado, 27, Ernesto Alvarez-Santos, 20, and Abel Garcia-Fernandez, 31, have been accused of “skimming.” On Tuesday, State Police responded to the Albion Walmart, where the three allegedly tried to use fraudulent gift cards. According to Troopers, Ramirez-Salgado tried to flee and resisted arrest, but was taken into custody. The other two men fled in a vehicle, police say, but were later spotted, stopped and detained. The three face multiple charges, including forgery, possession of a forged instrument, grand larceny, scheme to defraud, conspiracy and resisting arrest. They are believed to be part of a larger group of suspects using skimmers and the internet to steal information, according to Troopers. State Police say it is possible that the information of hundreds of people was stolen. The men were jailed in Orleans County on $100,000 bail. Victims of credit card fraud can call State Police at (585) 344-6200.

Kline 1 day ago SHARE SHARE TWEET SHARE EMAIL Colleges that have produced the most billionaires The most outrageous CEO salaries and perks Hostess' revival from bankruptcy protection to growing brand continues with three of the company's signature pastry treats -- Twinkies, Sno Balls, and CupCakes -- being made into ice cream. These limited-edition frozen treat pints will hit Dollar General stores in February before being released to convenience stores later in the year, CSP Industry News reported. This introduction, which may include even more Hostess-inspired flavors down the line, follows deep-fried Twinkies being added to the freezer section at Wal-Mart. The ice cream will be a partnership between Hostess and Nestle. Neither company has said how long the "limited-time" offer will last. What will Twinkies ice cream be? The Twinkies ice cream flavor will, according to CSP, include "sweet buttercream-flavored ice cream, sponge cake pieces and a vanilla frosting swirl." For the CupCakes variety, Nestle will use "chocolate ice cream, cake pieces and a cream frosting swirl," while the SnoBalls flavor will have a "marshmallow-flavored ice cream with chocolate cake pieces and a whipped coconut swirl." Why is this happening? Taking well-known food brands and moving them into new areas has been a growing trend. It's a phenomenon that has driven traffic to fast-food brands that have added snack chips including Doritos, Cheetos, and Fritos, to everything from tacos to hamburgers and fried macaroni and cheese balls. For the rights holder, these partnerships offer an opportunity to leverage a familiar brand name into a new format, which can bring in licensing revenue while serving as promotion for the original product. For a restaurant chain or stores like Dollar General and Wal-Mart, the tie-in with a well-known brand can bring in more foot traffic as fans of the original product seek to try it in its new form. Is this a good idea? While it's hard to see Twinkies, CupCakes, and SnoBalls being a long-term ice cream brand, as a short-term novelty it could be a hit as the products have fans young and old. Choosing to distribute through Dollar General and convenience stores instead of traditional supermarkets will limit sales, but the exclusivity could push curious customers to the places stocking these novelty treats. In addition, should the line be successful, Nestle and Hostess can eventually broaden distribution. Twinkies, Sno Balls, and CupCakes ice cream flavors could be a traffic driver for Dollar General because they are unique, but the concept is easy to understand. Mixing ice cream and baked goods is not a new idea as Oreo/cookies and cream flavors have long existed as have ice creams tied to various Girl Scout cookies. Using a well-known brand name like the Hostess products should spur at least one-time interest and should send Dollar General some new customers.

About 60 associates graduated from the Walmart Training Academy in Laurel. It is located at the Laurel Walmart Supercenter on Highway 15 North. The academy provides training for department managers, hourly supervisors and assistant managers and will serve about 30 stores in the region. "It was wonderful, it taught me everything I need to know, the ins and outs of Walmart," said Melinda Thomas, a graduate of the academy. "It's a wonderful day, it'a a beautiful day, I look forward to going back and teaching other associates now."       "It teaches you everything you need to know to grow, to expand, everything that (the company) has, they teach you," said Kimberley Norris, another graduate.  The Laurel academy is the 55th opened by the company.
