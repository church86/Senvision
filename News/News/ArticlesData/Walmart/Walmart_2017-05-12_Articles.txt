According to the company's website, it is hiring workers in 38 cities in the eastern U.S. states of Delaware, Georgia, Maryland, New Jersey, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina and Virginia. "The growth of Aldi and Lidl will require existing U.S. grocery retailers to start asking themselves how they can do things differently to control costs – from marketing and merchandising to operations and logistics," Bill Bishop, co-founder of retail consultancy Bricks Meets Clicks, said in an interview on Friday. Lidl is expected to post U.S. sales of roughly $1 billion in 2018, $2 billion in 2019 and $4 billion 2020, assuming it opens just under 100 stores per year, according to a recent note by retail think tank Fung Global Retail and Technology. This would put Lidl in close range of U.S. grocery chains like Ingles market, which had revenue of $3.2 billion in 2016; Sprouts Farmers Market with $4.3 billion in sales last year and SuperValu Inc (SVU.N), which posted sales of $4.8 billion, the report said. Analyst estimates suggest Lidl is eyeing more than 330 U.S stores by 2020. The retailer has opened three distribution centers in Maryland, North Carolina and Virginia.

(Dennis Nishi/IBD) REINHARDT KRAUSE 5/12/2017 Reprints If Federal Reserve Chairman Janet Yellen shops at Amazon.com (AMZN) like most Americans, she might pick up insights from the e-commerce behemoth to help her set future interest rates. In fact, Yellen & Co. might want to include Amazon in the mix when discussing oil, housing, health care and other inflationary costs that can signal whether to tap the brakes or let the economy keep rolling. "Amazon is killing lots of businesses. In the process, it may also be killing inflation," Ed Yardeni, noted economist and president of Yardeni Research, said in a recent report. Using Chief Executive Jeff Bezos' playbook, Amazon has pummeled rivals with price cuts enabled by its smart logistics and relentless drive toward efficiency. Labor-displacing warehouse robotics give Amazon a cost advantage, and it aims to one day deploy delivery drones to extend its edge all the way to the customer's doorstep. Amazon's casualty list already is formidable. Over the years, Amazon has left consumer-facing retailers such as Borders, Circuit City and Sports Authority in the dust. Department chains have been closing stores, unable to answer the e-commerce challenge. Now Amazon is taking on gargantuan retailers such as Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) and Costco Wholesale (COST). These big-box retailers are trying to fight back, and their main tool is cutting prices. And Amazon is impacting more parts of the U.S. economy as it expands from books, toys and electronics into apparel, groceries and entertainment. Cowen & Co. calls the "$1.3 trillion U.S. grocery market Amazon's biggest potential source of revenue upside." While Amazon's effect on the retail sector has grabbed headlines, there's also Amazon Business to consider. The online sales channel for business customers is sending prices down for industrial products, pressuring companies like W.W. Grainger (GWW). There's also Amazon Web Services, the fast-growing cloud computing business. A Citigroup report in April called the impact of AWS and cloud services "deflationary" on the information technology industry. Giant Scale For now, Fed officials say a tightening labor market has put upward pressure on wage costs. The Fed has hiked interest rates once this year, and is expected to do it twice more. The unemployment rate fell to 4.4% in April, below the structural rate and matching the lows of 2006-07. Yet some economists contend that Amazon's use of automation as it pushes into new markets looms as a long-term factor in restraining job and wage growth. Amazon's scale is unmatched. It's most conspicuous in the retail space. "Traditional retailers will struggle to compete with a business that generated an estimated $225 billion in global gross merchandise value in 2016, growing 29% year-over-year and has the discipline to operate at a 1% margin," said a recent Morgan Stanley report. The CEO of entertainment provider Liberty Media (LMCA), Greg Maffei, called Amazon a "ridiculously scary" rival at a financial conference May 9. Amazon "has an ability, because of its scale, to invest at incredibly low or negative rates of return — because they can cross-subsidize, and the market is willing to suspend disbelief in future profitability," Maffei said. Economist Yardeni, meanwhile, compares Amazon's scale to that of China. "Amazon arguably has done as much as the Chinese to kill jobs and keep a lid on inflation by enabling fast and easy price discovery for anyone with a cellphone," he said. Wal-Mart Impacted Amazon has quickly gained traction in apparel and is now the second-biggest retailer behind Wal-Mart. Now it's taking Wal-Mart head-on. A longtime price discounter itself, thanks to Chinese manufacturing partners, Wal-Mart has seen profits shrink amid Amazon's online onslaught. Wal-Mart in April began offering price discounts for 10,000 items that consumers buy online and then pick up in stores. By June, Wal-Mart plans to expand web discounting to 1 million items. Since it purchased e-commerce startup Jet.com last year, Wal-Mart has ratcheted up its battle with Amazon. Wal-Mart in January rolled out free, two-day shipping for orders over $35. Amazon last week cut its minimum order to $25. Another big-box retailer, Costco, is dealing with Amazon's push into new food categories. While Costco has a strong membership program, its best counterpunch is pricing, says a Piper Jaffray report. "Costco is cheaper than Amazon in consumables," the report said. Making It Easy Making competition intensify is the fact that consumers doing comparison shopping can do so on mobile phones as well as on home PCs. "Certainly online vs. in-store shopping has been a trend for over a decade. What seems new is the comparison shopping that is pervasive," said Don Rissmiller, economist at Strategas Research Partners. "This could be related to Amazon, but it's also that we have mobile devices with fast, readily available networks, and the apps to check the price of various items," Rissmiller said. "What we do know is the retail deflator turned negative in recent years and the Fed should absolutely pay attention." Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, says it's clear that Amazon's success is weighing on prices for many retail goods. "But the impact on overall inflation is small," Zandi told IBD. "The retail goods that Amazon provides account for only about 15% of the consumer basket," Zandi said. "So, if Amazon is responsible for reducing retail goods inflation by 1 percentage point per annum — an aggressive assumption — then this will reduce overall inflation by 0.15%. Not inconsequential, but not a game changer." Deflation In The Cloud In another part of the economy, information technology, Amazon also is a disrupter. Amazon's cloud-computing business is by far the biggest provider of computing resources via the internet, followed by Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google and others. As corporate America outsources more computing work to AWS and other highly automated cloud services, companies buy less hardware and software for internal data centers and cut back on IT staffing. In the March quarter, IBM's (IBM) hardware business fell nearly 17% to $2.5 billion year-over-year, reflecting the impact of cloud adoption. How do the likes of IBM, Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Hewlett Packard Enterprises (HPE) fight back? By cutting prices. "Cloud is deflationary and collapses markets," said a Citigroup report in April. "Labor, with 85% deflation in the cloud, has the most significant disruption from cloud economics," says the Citi report. It says 15 IT staffers in a public, shared cloud service can replace 100 in a private data center. AWS will rake in some $37.5 billion in revenue by 2020, up from $17 billion this year, estimates Citigroup. Since 2006, AWS has been steadily cutting prices for cloud services, with Google and Microsoft following suit. Customers pay cloud service providers as little as pennies an hour per server or as much as $1-$2 an hour, depending on the type of workload. Even with low prices, AWS operating income doubled in 2016 to $3.1 billion, owing to massive scale. "Perhaps most importantly, AWS' juicy operating profit margin of more than 25% gives Amazon a way to fund its new ventures and a retail business that has notoriously skinny margins," said Yardeni. "The cash and financial flexibility AWS provides ensure that Amazon will be a lethal competitor in the retailing industry for many years to come." Even More Influence Long-range, Amazon's influence on job growth and the economy could grow if rivals duplicate its strategies to stay competitive. In fact, Amazon is pushing in the direction of its competitors, driving its automation beyond warehouses and into the retail space. Amazon hopes to eliminate store cashiers at Amazon Go convenience stores now being tested. Amazon Go stores use sensors to track items as shoppers put them into baskets. The shopper's Amazon account gets automatically charged. Amazon recently was granted a patent for automated, "on-demand apparel manufacturing." The patent highlights plans to go beyond clothing into other fabric-based products, such as footwear, bedding and home goods. Amazon is also bringing more of its logistics and delivery operations in-house. "We're in the early stages of drones disrupting the trucking industry and transportation costs," David Rosenberg, chief economist at Gluskin Sheff, told IBD. "We're reaching an inflection point with robotics and automation, artificial intelligence and the shared economy. Most of these are massive supply-side deflationary developments." Rosenberg says Amazon is part of a new industrial revolution that could push wages down. "Amazon and e-commerce are part and parcel of the fourth industrial revolution," he said.

Christopher McInturff, 33, 209 Cherokee Road, was charged with attempted theft over $1,000 and shoplifting under $1,000. The victim, who was not named in the news release, told police she found her truck pried and with broken windows at the Walmart at 2914 W. Market St. McInturff was arrested after police determined he had shoplifted a tool from Walmart and used it to try to break into the vehicle, according to a news release. He has since been sent to the Washington County Detention Center, where he was held on $16,000 bond. His arraignment in Sessions Court was set for Wednesday. Tuesday was not the first time McInturff had been arrested from a situation at the West Market Walmart. In March, he was charged with motor vehicle theft, felony evading arrest, a habitual motor offender violation and reckless driving after a series of events that also began in the Walmart parking lot.

Lidl said in February it planned to open its first 20 U.S. stores in North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia, with 80 more to follow in the United States within the first year.

PRINCETON — David Jensen, who has been store manager of the Princeton Walmart Supercenter for the past 15 years, has accepted a similar position at a Walmart Supercenter in central Missouri in the city of Moberly. “It is close to where I grew up,” he explained on his last day in Princeton, which was May 5. “With my parents getting older, it will be nice to get back near my family.” Jensen said he will miss all the friends, acquaintances and customers he has met in the past 15 years living in Princeton. “This town is a fantastic town to raise kids here,” he said. “It is a very good town.” Jensen has worked 34 years for Walmart, starting out as a salesclerk and working his way up from there. “I will definitely miss the customers and all the relationships we have developed over 15 years,” he said.

For investors in Amazon, the most important number to remember is 20. When online sales hit 20% of all purchases in a given retail category, a surge in Amazon growth is sure to follow, according to L2 Inc., a business intelligence firm. It’s a threshold indicating “Amazon is going to displace a legacy retailer,” said Cooper Smith, L2’s director of Amazon research. “Twenty percent is when Amazon steps on the gas ... when consumer behavior is changing.” This pattern has held true for Amazon AMZN, +1.45% since the very first sector CEO Jeff Bezos disrupted, books, which passed the 20% mark between 2007 and 2008. Amazon’s rapid expansion into a “store for everything” continued as online sales passed 20% for consumer electronics between 2010 and 2011, and cloud services, which Amazon dominated from the moment it launched Amazon Web Services in 2006, each time fueling a turning point for the Seattle company. Don’t miss: How Amazon conquered books, electronics and the cloud Now the same trend is playing out in clothing and accessories, with online sales nearing the 20% threshold, said Smith. But the 20% milestone is proving more and more challenging to reach — nowhere more so than in the food and grocery market. What 20% means for Amazon’s foray into fashion The consumer transition to Amazon for clothing is happening fast, according to an April 28 report by Morgan Stanley. Amazon is the second largest U.S. apparel retailer, behind only Wal-Mart, with Amazon taking share from department stores and Target as it rises in prominence. Nearly half of 1,000 adults surveyed in Morgan Stanley’s latest Alphawise survey (46%) reported having bought clothing from Amazon in the past year. About the same percentage (47%) said they expected to buy more clothes from Amazon and fewer clothes from other retailers in the next 12 months. Online retailers have overcome much of the resistance to clothing sales with perks like free shipping and the ability to use your home as a fitting room, rather than actually having to trek to a store — and Amazon has capitalized on those benefits over the years through its Prime program. Cowen & Co. estimates Prime membership at about 50 million as of the fourth quarter of 2016. Traditional retailers, meanwhile, are struggling to win the business of young shoppers who say they’d rather spend money doing things than buying things, and remain disenchanted with the experience of shopping in physical stores. As a result, retailers that expanded their businesses by building more stores are now scaling back. More than 3,500 closures have been announced by department stores including Macy’s Inc. M, -3.04%  , Sears Holdings Inc. SHLD, -6.59% and J.C. Penney Co. Inc. JCP, -13.99%  ; specialty stores such as those run by Gap Inc. GPS, -2.68% and Ralph Lauren Co. RL, -3.57%  ; and chain-store operators that have filed for bankruptcy or liquidated, including Payless ShoeSource, Aeropostale Inc. AROPQ, +5.77% and Sports Authority. See: Nike and Coach are fighting Amazon by creating stores that appeal to all the senses Also: From a risk-of-bankruptcy standpoint, the retail business is the new oil and gas Retailers with the resources to do so, such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. WMT, -0.55% and Target Corp. TGT, -0.46% , are gearing up to fight Amazon for market share, with both companies putting billions of dollars behind the effort. Wal-Mart invested on the price side of the equation. The company made a $3.3 billion purchase of Jet.com and, more recently, scooped up a number of niche fashion sites, including ModCloth and Moosejaw. The company is also said to be in talks to purchase men’s-wear retailer Bonobos. Also: Wal-Mart is beating the pants off Amazon in apparel, and it’s fighting to keep it that way Plus: Wal-Mart to offer discounts for online orders collected at stores Target, meanwhile, keeps adding to its list of private labels, with exclusivity central to its $7 billion overhaul strategy, along with store remodels and a competitive-pricing push. Read: Target is adding stores, but analysts say it should be cutting locations instead Amazon‘s head start, though, could make it all but impossible to dislodge. “Amazon is the main beneficiary of e-commerce growth,” Smith said. KeyBanc Capital Markets estimates that Amazon already has at least 14 private-label brands. “We think that apparel may serve as one of the single biggest incremental growth opportunities in Amazon’s retail business,” KeyBanc analysts including Managing Director Edward Yruma wrote in a March note. Amazon’s private-label goods range from men’s dress shirts to women’s underwear. “These categories lend themselves to repeat purchases, have fewer national wholesale brand competitors, and can leverage Amazon’s data advantage,” the note said. Also: The retail sector is shedding jobs like it’s a recession Amazon declined to comment on its fashion strategy. Apparel is more complex than the media or electronics categories that Amazon tackled early on, so the company is going after items that are “highly commoditized,” like socks and shoes, said Smith. But even though online sales of clothing are nearing the 20% mark, Amazon still faces many challenges in the category. Recent research by Cowen & Co. found that 76% of consumers polled preferred to go to a store for clothes, shoes and accessories. “While longer term, we anticipate consumer preferences will likely continue to shift online, we believe traditional stores will continue to play an integral role in the retail experience,” they said. Still, with opinion shifting about Amazon’s style credibility, shopping habits are following suit. The number of people saying that style is not an Amazon attribute is shrinking. “We think this speaks to how Amazon’s fashion efforts are having an impact on consumer behavior and their willingness to shop for fashion on the site, which over time could lead to even faster apparel growth,” said the Morgan Stanley report. See: Amazon’s most sought-after clothing brands include Nike, Adidas and Under Armour Companies that aren’t being steamrolled are doing something that Amazon can’t. Brands like Everlane and Warby Parker, for example, offer something unique — and that breeds loyalty. Everlane promises “radical transparency,” explaining why items are priced as they are, with a breakdown of such line items as material and labor costs. Eyeglasses purveyor Warby Parker will ship five frames to customers for free to try at home. And there are some experiences that can’t be replicated online. For example, the success of off-price retailers like T.J. Maxx, a TJX Cos. TJX, -2.72% company; Burlington Stores Inc. BURL, -3.45%   ; and Ross Stores Inc. ROST, -2.67% can be attributed to what experts call the “treasure hunt” nature of shopping in those stores, analysts say. “Most pockets of retail success today have some sort of protective moat around their business that helps them fend off Amazon,” said Jared Wiesel, partner at Revenue Analytics. “Take home improvement. While I can certainly buy a power drill online, if I am starting a kitchen remodel, Amazon is unlikely to reap any of my spend.” Fewer and fewer categories nowadays have the cushion that home improvement enjoys. Food fight If changing consumer behavior is key to getting people to buy goods online, there’s a long way to go before online grocery shopping goes mainstream, or reaches the 20% threshold that favors Amazon’s prospects. Online sales account for less than 1% of the $1 trillion grocery market in the U.S., one of the lowest online market shares in all of retail, according to a Moody’s note in March. The credit-rating agency doesn’t expect this online market to grow to more than a 2% or 3% share over the next five years. The company’s standard playbook may not be as effective in the food space, analysts say. Read: Bottled water is now more popular than soda — why you should avoid both “We think most of the growth in online grocery sales will be limited to certain densely populated metropolitan areas, where income levels are more conducive to higher-priced online grocery purchases,” the Moody’s report said. Building a grocery business is going to require major investments in distribution centers, delivery trucks that can bring perishables to customer doorsteps, and other logistical developments that will hamper profits. Curbside pickup is one online model that Moody’s analysts believe can lead to online grocery success. Wal-Mart has planted its flag in the online food and consumer-goods area with its Jet purchase and with curbside pickup, which the company continues to expand. With this service, shoppers pull up to a store, but don’t even need to get out of their cars as a Wal-Mart staffer loads groceries into the vehicle. Recently, Amazon announced the launch of AmazonFresh Pickup, which remains in beta at just two Seattle locations. “It’s going to be a slower disruption than [in] consumer electronics and media,” L2’s Smith said. “But I wouldn’t bet against Amazon’s efforts to disrupt groceries.” Amazon shares have gained 28% in 2017, while the S&P 500 SPX, -0.15%  has gained about 7%.

For investors in Amazon, the most important number to remember is 20. When online sales hit 20% of all purchases in a given retail category, a surge in Amazon growth is sure to follow, according to L2 Inc., a business intelligence firm. It’s a threshold indicating “Amazon is going to displace a legacy retailer,” said Cooper Smith, L2’s director of Amazon research. “Twenty percent is when Amazon steps on the gas ... when consumer behavior is changing.” This pattern has held true for Amazon AMZN, +1.45% since the very first sector CEO Jeff Bezos disrupted, books, which passed the 20% mark between 2007 and 2008. Amazon’s rapid expansion into a “store for everything” continued as online sales passed 20% for consumer electronics between 2010 and 2011, and cloud services, which Amazon dominated from the moment it launched Amazon Web Services in 2006, each time fueling a turning point for the Seattle company. Don’t miss: How Amazon conquered books, electronics and the cloud Now the same trend is playing out in clothing and accessories, with online sales nearing the 20% threshold, said Smith. But the 20% milestone is proving more and more challenging to reach — nowhere more so than in the food and grocery market. What 20% means for Amazon’s foray into fashion The consumer transition to Amazon for clothing is happening fast, according to an April 28 report by Morgan Stanley. Amazon is the second largest U.S. apparel retailer, behind only Wal-Mart, with Amazon taking share from department stores and Target as it rises in prominence. Nearly half of 1,000 adults surveyed in Morgan Stanley’s latest Alphawise survey (46%) reported having bought clothing from Amazon in the past year. About the same percentage (47%) said they expected to buy more clothes from Amazon and fewer clothes from other retailers in the next 12 months. Online retailers have overcome much of the resistance to clothing sales with perks like free shipping and the ability to use your home as a fitting room, rather than actually having to trek to a store — and Amazon has capitalized on those benefits over the years through its Prime program. Cowen & Co. estimates Prime membership at about 50 million as of the fourth quarter of 2016. Traditional retailers, meanwhile, are struggling to win the business of young shoppers who say they’d rather spend money doing things than buying things, and remain disenchanted with the experience of shopping in physical stores. As a result, retailers that expanded their businesses by building more stores are now scaling back. More than 3,500 closures have been announced by department stores including Macy’s Inc. M, -3.04%  , Sears Holdings Inc. SHLD, -6.59% and J.C. Penney Co. Inc. JCP, -13.99%  ; specialty stores such as those run by Gap Inc. GPS, -2.68% and Ralph Lauren Co. RL, -3.57%  ; and chain-store operators that have filed for bankruptcy or liquidated, including Payless ShoeSource, Aeropostale Inc. AROPQ, +5.77% and Sports Authority. See: Nike and Coach are fighting Amazon by creating stores that appeal to all the senses Also: From a risk-of-bankruptcy standpoint, the retail business is the new oil and gas Retailers with the resources to do so, such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. WMT, -0.55% and Target Corp. TGT, -0.46% , are gearing up to fight Amazon for market share, with both companies putting billions of dollars behind the effort. Wal-Mart invested on the price side of the equation. The company made a $3.3 billion purchase of Jet.com and, more recently, scooped up a number of niche fashion sites, including ModCloth and Moosejaw. The company is also said to be in talks to purchase men’s-wear retailer Bonobos. Also: Wal-Mart is beating the pants off Amazon in apparel, and it’s fighting to keep it that way Plus: Wal-Mart to offer discounts for online orders collected at stores Target, meanwhile, keeps adding to its list of private labels, with exclusivity central to its $7 billion overhaul strategy, along with store remodels and a competitive-pricing push. Read: Target is adding stores, but analysts say it should be cutting locations instead Amazon‘s head start, though, could make it all but impossible to dislodge. “Amazon is the main beneficiary of e-commerce growth,” Smith said. KeyBanc Capital Markets estimates that Amazon already has at least 14 private-label brands. “We think that apparel may serve as one of the single biggest incremental growth opportunities in Amazon’s retail business,” KeyBanc analysts including Managing Director Edward Yruma wrote in a March note. Amazon’s private-label goods range from men’s dress shirts to women’s underwear. “These categories lend themselves to repeat purchases, have fewer national wholesale brand competitors, and can leverage Amazon’s data advantage,” the note said. Also: The retail sector is shedding jobs like it’s a recession Amazon declined to comment on its fashion strategy. Apparel is more complex than the media or electronics categories that Amazon tackled early on, so the company is going after items that are “highly commoditized,” like socks and shoes, said Smith. But even though online sales of clothing are nearing the 20% mark, Amazon still faces many challenges in the category. Recent research by Cowen & Co. found that 76% of consumers polled preferred to go to a store for clothes, shoes and accessories. “While longer term, we anticipate consumer preferences will likely continue to shift online, we believe traditional stores will continue to play an integral role in the retail experience,” they said. Still, with opinion shifting about Amazon’s style credibility, shopping habits are following suit. The number of people saying that style is not an Amazon attribute is shrinking. “We think this speaks to how Amazon’s fashion efforts are having an impact on consumer behavior and their willingness to shop for fashion on the site, which over time could lead to even faster apparel growth,” said the Morgan Stanley report. See: Amazon’s most sought-after clothing brands include Nike, Adidas and Under Armour Companies that aren’t being steamrolled are doing something that Amazon can’t. Brands like Everlane and Warby Parker, for example, offer something unique — and that breeds loyalty. Everlane promises “radical transparency,” explaining why items are priced as they are, with a breakdown of such line items as material and labor costs. Eyeglasses purveyor Warby Parker will ship five frames to customers for free to try at home. And there are some experiences that can’t be replicated online. For example, the success of off-price retailers like T.J. Maxx, a TJX Cos. TJX, -2.72% company; Burlington Stores Inc. BURL, -3.45%   ; and Ross Stores Inc. ROST, -2.67% can be attributed to what experts call the “treasure hunt” nature of shopping in those stores, analysts say. “Most pockets of retail success today have some sort of protective moat around their business that helps them fend off Amazon,” said Jared Wiesel, partner at Revenue Analytics. “Take home improvement. While I can certainly buy a power drill online, if I am starting a kitchen remodel, Amazon is unlikely to reap any of my spend.” Fewer and fewer categories nowadays have the cushion that home improvement enjoys. Food fight If changing consumer behavior is key to getting people to buy goods online, there’s a long way to go before online grocery shopping goes mainstream, or reaches the 20% threshold that favors Amazon’s prospects. Online sales account for less than 1% of the $1 trillion grocery market in the U.S., one of the lowest online market shares in all of retail, according to a Moody’s note in March. The credit-rating agency doesn’t expect this online market to grow to more than a 2% or 3% share over the next five years. The company’s standard playbook may not be as effective in the food space, analysts say. Read: Bottled water is now more popular than soda — why you should avoid both “We think most of the growth in online grocery sales will be limited to certain densely populated metropolitan areas, where income levels are more conducive to higher-priced online grocery purchases,” the Moody’s report said. Building a grocery business is going to require major investments in distribution centers, delivery trucks that can bring perishables to customer doorsteps, and other logistical developments that will hamper profits. Curbside pickup is one online model that Moody’s analysts believe can lead to online grocery success. Wal-Mart has planted its flag in the online food and consumer-goods area with its Jet purchase and with curbside pickup, which the company continues to expand. With this service, shoppers pull up to a store, but don’t even need to get out of their cars as a Wal-Mart staffer loads groceries into the vehicle. Recently, Amazon announced the launch of AmazonFresh Pickup, which remains in beta at just two Seattle locations. “It’s going to be a slower disruption than [in] consumer electronics and media,” L2’s Smith said. “But I wouldn’t bet against Amazon’s efforts to disrupt groceries.” Amazon shares have gained 28% in 2017, while the S&P 500 SPX, -0.15%  has gained about 7%.

Spent $3.3 Billion on Jet.com The retailer paid a huge amount of money to buy an executive team that can inject startup thinking into the brick-and-mortar retailer. Daniel B. Kline (TMFDankline) May 12, 2017 at 12:11PM When Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) spent $3.3 billion to purchase Jet.com, it was buying a money-losing company with no clear path to profitability. Yes, the company had grown fast, reaching $1 billion in sales, but it was spending heavily to get there. It's possible Jet would have become a success on its own, but it's more likely that was never the end goal. The company, run by CEO Marc Lore, together with co-founders Mike Hanrahan and Nate Faust, almost certainly considered that if it got big enough, Wal-Mart -- or another brick-and-mortar retailer looking for digital answers -- would come calling. They may have even been counting on it. That's exactly what the trio had done with Quidsi, the parent company of e-commerce sites Diapers.com, Soap.com, and Wag.com. They built it up into a threat, albeit a money-losing one, and then sold it to Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), with Wal-Mart also bidding.  In this case, Wal-Mart may not even want Jet.com, though it's still running it as a standalone brand. What it wanted was Lore, who now runs Walmart.com, along with Jet.com and, to a lesser extent, his team. Marc Lore is charged with revamping Wal-Mart's online operations. Image source: Wal-Mart. What did Wal-Mart do? Wal-Mart may be No. 2 to Amazon when it comes to online sales, but that's a bit like saying after The Beatles and The Rolling Stones, Oasis is the best band to come out of England. It may be technically true (though not a provable fact), but the gulf between the top tier and the next one is very large. In this case, Wal-Mart bought Jet.com to hire Lore to inject start-up thinking into a brand that was simply not wired that way. To the company's credit, Lore said in his speech at the March ShopTalk conference that Wal-Mart had "gone all in with him." By that, he explained that the company, from CEO Doug McMillon on down, showed a willingness to break past habits and infuse digital-first thinking into the whole operation. McMillon laid out his logic for buying Jet.com in a press release when the deal was announced. What he notably did not do is try to justify the price: We're looking for ways to lower prices, broaden our assortment, and offer the simplest, easiest shopping experience, because that's what our customers want. We believe the acquisition of Jet accelerates our progress across these priorities. Walmart.com will grow faster, the seamless shopping experience we're pursuing will happen quicker, and we'll enable the Jet brand to be even more successful in a shorter period of time. Our customers will win. It's another jolt of entrepreneurial spirit being injected into Wal-Mart. My shock at the deal is not from a belief that Lore should not be running WalMart.com. He's a smart pick for the job and has shown a boldness in being willing to move fast, abandon bad ideas, and try new ones. Why is this a problem? The problem is not Lore or his team; it's that Wal-Mart bought Jet.com for $3.3 billion to get them. Wal-Mart essentially bought an executive team, some technology, a growing customer base that Jet paid dearly to acquire, and vendor relationships that enhance Wal-Mart's offering. Wal-Mart could have done all of this on its own for a fraction of the price. Jet.com's shopping cart is innovative, but Wal-Mart could clearly have built something similar. and as the world's largest retailer, the company could have created any vendor relationships it wanted to have while also pushing down prices. Lore is smart, and a good leader, but it's hard to believe he's $3.3 billion unique when it comes to solving Wal-Mart's logistics problems. Basically, the company has to figure out how to best modify a supply chain built to stock stores into one that can do that while also shipping individual orders quickly. That's a vexing problem, and one that Lore may well fix, but it's also one that could have been solved without buying Jet.com, a company that probably would have burned out or been bought by some other brick-and-mortar retailer desperate for a digital guru to tell it how to fix things. How does this story end? Lore will at first push Wal-Mart's digital sales higher while pushing margin down because of shipping costs. He will probably succeed in breaking some of company's ingrained thinking, and he will almost certainly frame it as a positive when the company shuts down Jet.com to better focus on its core brand. That's not something Wal-Mart has hinted at, but it's usually how these things go. This deal could end up being a success because Lore should be able to better integrate the retailer's physical and digital operations. That will be a slow process, and in the end the company will still be No. 2 behind Amazon -- a stronger No. 2, but No. 2 nonetheless. This deal feels like a panic move. Wal-Mart bought a failing competitor that never proved it had a viable model, in order to hire its team. That team may well succeed at Wal-Mart, but to accept this deal being worth what the company paid for Jet.com, you have to believe Lore was $3.3 billion better than anyone else Wal-Mart could have hired, and that's a hard pill to swallow.  Daniel Kline has no position in any stocks mentioned.

(Ontario Provincial Police / Twitter) Ryan Flanagan, CTV Kitchener Published Friday, May 12, 2017 11:46AM EDT A thief who made it out of a store in Fergus with items she hadn’t paid for didn’t get much further. According to the OPP, the shoplifter visited the Walmart on St. David Street on April 26. Surveillance camera footage from outside the store shows the woman quickly pushing her cart away from the store. At one point, the woman loses her footing and the cart careens into a curb, where it tips over and spills its load. The woman then gets back on her feet and walks away without the merchandise.

Media-Joshua.cunningham@opp.ca pic.twitter.com/RYfXBM2ZyC — OPP West (@OPP_WR) May 12, 2017 Police said Friday that the woman’s cart contained more than $650 worth of stolen items. They also said it wasn’t the first time she had stolen goods from that Walmart. Store employees told police that she had stolen nearly $2,500 worth of products a few days earlier. In both cases, she was allegedly helped by two men and three women. OPP describe the woman as being white, likely in her 40s, and weighing about 165 pounds. They say she has glasses, as well as a tattoo on her back, and was seen wearing a light-coloured long-sleeved shirt and black pants. The men helping her are believed to be in their 30s. One of them has short, dark hair, while the other was seen wearing a red and white baseball cap. The women are all believed to be in their 20s. Police say one has long dark hair, a second has long blond hair, and the third “is prone to concealing her face.” Anyone with information is asked to contact Wellington County OPP or Crime Stoppers.

REUTERS/John Gress/Files By Jonathan Stempel, Reuters May 11, 2017 at 4:33 pm | Print View A federal judge on Thursday ordered Wal-Mart Stores Inc Chief Executive Douglas McMillon to submit to questioning in a lawsuit by shareholders hoping to learn what he knows about suspected bribery by the world’s largest retailer in Mexico. U.S. District Judge Susan Hickey in Fayetteville, Arkansas, said McMillon’s “direct and personal involvement” in matters underlying a class-action lawsuit justified requiring him to sit for a deposition by the shareholders’ lawyers. McMillon had been president of Wal-Mart International during a period when shareholders led by a Michigan pension fund said the retailer concealed suspected bribery by its Wal-Mart de Mexico unit to government officials, to speed up store openings. The Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer had argued that McMillon lacked the “unique or special knowledge” to justify burdening him with a deposition. But the judge said McMillon, who became chief executive in February 2014, took part in several meetings, saw dozens of communications, and had certified many public statements by Wal-Mart about the alleged bribery. “It appears to the court that McMillon has unique knowledge of relevant issues in this litigation that only he can explain,” Hickey wrote. A deposition could last four hours, she added. Wal-Mart had no immediate comment. Jason Forge, a lawyer for the lead plaintiff City of Pontiac General Employees’ Retirement System, said in an email: “We’re determined to try this case in court.” Wal-Mart’s market value slid $17 billion over three days in April 2012 after the New York Times reported the alleged bribery and said it had been first discovered internally in 2005. Shareholders accused Wal-Mart and Mike Duke, who preceded McMillon as chief executive, of downplaying the scheme even after learning about the Times’ investigation. The class period runs from Dec. 8, 2011 to April 20, 2012. Earlier this week, Bloomberg News said Wal-Mart may pay about $300 million to settle a U.S. government probe into suspected bribery in Mexico, India and China, citing people familiar with the matter. A $300 million payment would represent about one week of profit for Wal-Mart. The case is City of Pontiac General Employees’ Retirement System v. Wal-Mart Stores Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Western District of Arkansas, No. 12-05162. (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Tom Brown) Like what you're reading?

Consumer Reports said a score of 100 would mean survey respondents were completely satisified, 80 would mean very satisfied and 60 very fairly well satisfied.

Live Watch Thinking out of the Big Box: How Big Box stores are competing with Amazon By BECKY WORLEY May 12, 2017, 8:17 AM ET 0 Shares Email Star PlayJoe Raedle/Getty Images WATCH What traditional retail stores are doing to compete with online retailers 0 Shares Email When stores compete for business, at least in the short term, shoppers benefit. The current battle royale? Amazon vs. in-store shopping. Yes, this contest has been building for years, but it’s reached a tipping point. A chart of Amazon’s sales numbers have sky-rocketed up over the past few years. The increase in sales has seen malls shuttered, national chains closing stores and stalwarts of retail shaking in their boots. This level of disruption has prompted two of the biggest names in retail to get very creative with their in-store design, technology, and marketing. This impacts consumers by providing more convenience, an in-store experience that mimics online shopping while providing new amenities, and savings opportunities. Wal-Mart has test locations around the country, including a store in Texas just outside of Houston where I go to test their cashier-less checkout and automated store. As I enter I grab a scanner from a rack by the door. I grab items from the racks and scan them putting them straight into the shopping bags I brought. I get instant price information and when I hit the checkout, I point my scanner at the kiosk, insert my credit card and 32 seconds after rolling up I am checked out and on my way. Considering that a normal checkout with a cashier takes me five to seven minutes, this is a time-savings. Amazon Completes 1st Drone Delivery Amazon's new virtual stylist raises privacy concerns There are other modernized aspects of shopping at this Wal-Mart: no fast food here, instead a healthy and modern Chobani Café that feels so un-Wal-mart-like it’s almost jarring. There is also a lot of technology: an automated fabric cutter, deli orders placed by tablet, and huge touch screen monitors at the end of some aisles where shoppers can search Walmart.com for items they weren’t able to find in-store. Wal-Mart spokesperson Anne Hatfield says they don’t see these automation features leading to a reduction in their workforce, instead, she says they are employing people in other areas of the store as they add amenities. For example Wal-Mart and Target have both tested drive-up service for online orders. I place an order on my phone from Walmart.com, just two hours later I receive a notification that it’s ready for pick-up. At this Wal-Mart test facility that offers the service, I pull up to a kiosk outside and without ever getting out of the car I use the touchscreen to find my order, pull forward into the delivery bay and a Wal-Mart employee loads the items into my car. I would have loved this when my kids still napped in the car or if I had mobility issues. Wal-Mart’s Anne Hatfield tells me, “We see most pickups at night. People order their groceries online and drive thru to pick them up on the way home.” Wal-mart also touts the speed of this shopping method; to compete with Amazon’s one-day delivery, they say picking up at a near-by store on the same-day is more convenient for many shoppers. Wal-Mart is so convinced about this order online and pick-up in-store model that they are incentivizing customers with discounts. On their corporate blog, E-Commerce CEO Marc Lore says, “The Pickup Discount will initially be available on about 10,000 items. We will then roll out the discount to more than one million of the most popular items by the end of June.” The chain calls out a $50 discount on an HDTV and an $8 discount on a car seat. Not to be outdone Amazon countered by lowering the minimum purchase threshold for free shipping from $35 to $25. While these may not seem like “Black-Fridayesque” discounts, it’s an savings arms race worth watching. As retailers get more creative and aggressive, they will be fighting with discounts to get your business. Target has a different approach, they are creating a test store also in Houston with two separate entrances. One that focuses on speed and convenience; their most purchased items are all stocked up close to the entrance and grab and go food options are available too. The other entrance of the building leads to a more traditional Target browsing experience. And it’s not just superstores fighting back, fashion brands are looking at technologies that bring online shopping features into the dressing rooms and makeup counters. The Oak Lab's Oak Mirror senses the items you bring into the dressing room and lets you see other color and sizing options available in the store. It has an option for requesting a sales associate bring them to you so you never have to leave the dressing room. If the items you want are not available in-store, you can use Apple Pay on your phone to buy the items via the mirror and have them sent to your house. The MemoMi Memory Mirror provides an augmented reality experience for trying on makeup in stores. If you want to see which shade of lipstick looks best, look into the mirror and select as bold or subtle a shade as you want. Again if the makeup counter doesn’t stock the shade you want- order it online and have it in a few days. The future of retail is changing and at least for now, savvy shoppers will benefit. 0 Shares Email Star Comments " How Big Box stores are competing with Amazon " Comey will not testify next week but Rosenstein to brief Senate on firing " What Trump says Comey told him about being cleared " More Americans disapprove of Comey's firing than approve, poll shows " Police chief killed in Ohio was father of 6 Shortlist to replace Comey includes former NYPD commissioner " Michelle Obama criticizes Trump school lunch decision " At least 3 dead in latest Ebola outbreak " Judge: Corrupt ex-LA sheriff's crimes an 'embarrassment' " Senator says Trump 'may be obstructing justice' " Fashion designer Carolina Herrera's nephew killed in Caracas " 5 immigrant women vie for Miss USA pageant title " Newlyweds reunited with lost wedding rings after Texas tornado " Soccer coach comes out to team as transgender: 'I'm still me' " Why the 'exercise pill' isn't likely to eliminate the gym any time soon " New dinosaur named after 'Ghostbusters' monster " Texan Richard Overton, the oldest US WWII vet, turns 111 " Eighth-graders help create 3D prosthetic hand for farmer " 7 siblings adopted together after years in foster care " Dog named Huckleberry becomes star for hanging out on owners' roof " Shelter in search of forever home for 'saddest dog in the world' for the final time " 90-year-old grandpa serves as best man at grandson's wedding " Paralyzed mom hangs off cliff in Mother's Day photo shoot " How two moms are celebrating Mother's Day with their 1st child " Undocumented mother granted temporary stay on deportation after 86 days in sanctuary " US prepares to ban laptops on flights from Europe " Ex-prep school official, Teacher of Year admits sex assault " Pope cheered in Fatima to honor children who urged peace " Sister says Arkansas slaying suspect battled mental illness " Astronauts ace station's 200th spacewalk, shortened by leak " Hundreds pay final respects to slain Boston doctors " Ram pickup air bags can fail in rollover; 1 death reported " China, US reach agreement on beef, poultry and natural gas " United flight delayed after scorpion reported aboard " Russian fighter flies 20 feet from Navy plane over Black Sea " Ex-teacher who allegedly kidnapped teen to remain in jail until trial " Coroner to reopen case into 8-year-old's hanging after school releases video " 'Dance Moms' star talks new show after prison sentence " New 'exoskeleton' technology can help protect seniors from slips and falls " GOP lawmaker cautions health care bill is Obamacare 'tweak' " John McAfee, from tech pioneer to 'person of interest' in a murder case to presidential candidate " Music Review: Harry Styles looks to past icons on solo debut " J.K.

When I asked him to describe it, he referred to it as kind of like a “cheaper Trader Joe’s.” The Trader Joe’s comparison makes sense since the same company owns both brands, but the word that’s always stuck with me is “cheaper.” Aldi has always defined itself by being cheaper. The name is even short of “Albrecht Diskont” – the founders’ surname and the German word for “discount.” And now, Aldi in the US is putting that reputation on the line, attempting to undercut the best known discount retailer in the country: Walmart. Based on a conversation with Jason Hart, CEO of Aldi US, Reuters outlined his company’s aggressive ambitions for expansion and growth in the American market. At the heart of the plan is using more low-cost private label products to pull price conscious shoppers away from places like Walmart, as well as a $1.6 billion investment to remodel 1,300 stores and add 400 more. “We are re-merchandising, remodeling, enhancing our product range and are focused on gaining volume so more customers start their shopping at Aldi and we are able to complete their shopping lists more so than we have in the past,” Hart told the news outlet. brightcove-video:5360903104001 The impending fight for title of low-cost king could mean some serious cheap eats for customers. Aldi currently boasts that its own figures show that the grocer has prices 21 percent lower than its competitors. But at the same time, Reuters reports that Walmart is also attempting to undercut Aldi by as much as 15 percent in many markets. Granted, comparing the two companies can be a bit tricky: Only about 30 percent of Walmart’s supermarket products are store brands, whereas 90 percent of Aldi items are from its own private label. But if you’re not worried about brand names, expect to find extra cheap goods in both places. Meanwhile, Aldi’s $1.6 billion investment in its stores is also intended to drive down the chain’s prices. “The remodels are aimed at increasing our volumes which means more purchasing power that will help us lower prices further,” Scott Patton, Aldi's vice president of corporate buying, was quoted as saying. “Aldi is disrupting the sector the way Wal-Mart did when they started,” one retail consultant told Reuters. Uh, is that supposed to be a good thing or an ominous warning??

Tech Apple Science Cars Samsung Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 Nintendo NES E3     Nintendo Switch Stock Updates For May 12 Posted: May 12 2017, 6:32am CDT | by Luigi Lugmayr, in News | Technology News     The latest Nintendo Switch stock tracking information for online and in stores for Friday, May 12th. Today the Nintendo Switch is available online as part of bundles. On May 10 GameStop has released three new Nintendo Switch bundles. One of the bundles has sold out and only two remain for purchase today. Both bundles ship within 24 hours.  Don't Miss: Nintendo Switch with Gray Joy-Con in Stock Online The Nintendo Switch has been on sale on Fridays the past weeks at the Walmart online shop. We expect that Walmart is again hosting a Nintendo Switch flash sale today at around 5pm ET. Nintendo believes the Nintendo Switch will be as big as the extremely successful Nintendo Wii. Looking at the current shortage, the Japanese video game maker has a long road ahead of them to ship 101 million Nintendo Switch consoles. The positive reception and praise of the Nintendo Switch fuel the demand for the mobile and home console hybrid. Nintendo is also busy marketing the Nintendo Switch with hands-on events and at the E3 2017. Find below the latest Nintendo Switch online availability updates and stock tracking updates for stores. Nintendo Switch Stock at Online Stores On May 12, 2017 the Nintendo Switch is available online as part of two bundles starting at $479.99 online at gamestop.com. We expect that Walmart is again hosting a Nintendo Switch flash sale today at around 5pm ET. Walmart is also only selling the Nintendo Switch as bundle, but more affordable with prices starting at $365. At this point no online retailer is selling the $299.99 Nintendo Switch consoles. The Nintendo Switch will continue to be hard to find for the foreseeable future. Nintendo plans to ship 10 million consoles world-wide in the time from April 2017 to April 2018. From the launch on Mach 3 to April 27, the Mario company sold 2.74 million Switch consoles. Online stores restocked the $299.99 Nintendo Switch with Gray Joy-Con and the $299.99 Nintendo Switch with Neon Joy-Con in time for the launch of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe on April 28. Since then the Switch console was out of stock online, besides the TRU bundle offer, according to data from The Tracker. The Nintendo Switch reseller markups keep steady and range today between $90 to $110 for the Nintendo Switch with Gray Joy-Con and $100 to $130 for the Nintendo Switch with Neon Joy-Con on amazon.com. The Nintendo Switch with Neon Joy-Con is more rare than the console with Gray controllers, resulting in considerable higher market value. Overall the Nintendo Switch market prices have risen slightly. To find Nintendo Switch in stock online, shoppers can use our new The Tracker app, available as free download for iOS and Android.  There are also several new accessories coming on the market from Nintendo in the next weeks. See the full list of new Nintendo Switch accessories. When is Nintendo Switch in stock online again? Nintendo is ramping up the production for the Nintendo Switch, but has not disclosed what the current production capacity per month is. The demand for the Nintendo Switch will spike during the Holiday Shopping season 2017. Nintendo will set aside a large part of the Switch production during the next months for November and December. This stock piling will keep the Nintendo Switch in short supply during the next 5 months. As Nintendo coordinated new Switch console shipment with the launch of Mario Kart 8, we expect the company to do the same for the next major Switch game launches. This means the next big wave of new Switch consoles comes in mid-June for the release of ARMS. The Nintendo Switch will likely be offered in special bundles in time for the Holidays. A Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Switch bundle has already surfaced in Russia. Because of the incredible demand for the Switch console, the monetary savings on these bundles will be limited. Usually bundles offer a way for consumers to get a free game. Nintendo can afford to just offer some savings, unless the demand is slowing down. Read the latest Nintendo Switch news. How to find a Nintendo Switch in Stock Online We developed the The Tracker app to make finding stock of rare products online as easy and stress free as possible. Download the free app for Apple iPhone or Android phones. From the list products you select to be notified for the Switch with Grey Joy-Con and/or Neon Joy-Con. That is it. It is set and forget. At the moment we detect the Nintendo Switch console in stock at major online retailers, you receive a notification on your smartphone. Now you are just a tap away from buying a Nintendo Switch. You can also see the current availability of the Nintendo Switch consoles in the web version of The Tracker: Nintendo Switch with Gray Joy-Con, Nintendo Switch with Neon Joy-Con. Nintendo Switch in Stock at Stores GameStop is restocking the Nintendo Switch since Thursday in stores too. The Nintendo Switch is also only available as part of bundles at GameStop retail locations. The Nintendo Switch is available in 133 Walmart stores, 193 Target stores, 142 GameStop locations according to the Nintendo Switch inventory tracker iStockNow (7:30am ET). The number of Walmart stores dropped dramatically yesterday from over 1,000 stores to about 130 mid-day on May 11. The number of stores stayed the same today. We assume Walmart stores did not receive any significant Switch shipments. The Nintendo flagship store in New York said on April 28 in a tweet to have the Nintendo Switch in stock each morning. People in New York or visitors can give this purchase option a try. Social media posts from people who visited the flagship store confirm the availability of the Switch at the Nintendo store in New York. Some even report that they saw the Switch still on the shelves late afternoon. Read the latest Nintendo Switch news.

When You’re Running Low On Goods Retail Doc Portrait PDF Landscape PDF Doc EMail Share Facebook LinkedIn Twitter Available to Premium & Purple Members Wal-Mart is filing a patent for automatic ordering that will directly rival Amazon Dash Anna Johansson 12 may 2017 It’s only been a couple of years since Amazon introduced their Dash system, which can order things like printer ink or laundry detergent at the push of a button, so it was only a matter of time before other major retailers hopped on the bandwagon. Now, Wal-Mart is introducing sensor technology that will note when products like milk are about to expire and send you more. This information comes from a patent application that requests ownership of sensor technology to be placed in the homes of customers. It’s a system that will function similar to the Amazon Dash technology, but it’s meant to encompass more products. It will also quietly collect consumer behavioral data to help them better market their products and services. How does this patent technology differ from the one used by Amazon Dash? It primarily differs in its purpose. The Dash button was placed in a single location and conveyed a certain function: ordering a specific item such as laundry detergent. You need hundreds of Dash buttons at $4.99 apiece to refill your pantry and cleaning closet, and you can’t place a second order until the first one has arrived. This means if you want an extra order of Pop-Tarts because you’re hosting guests for a weekend, you have to go to the store or manually order them. It also differs on the data collection side. Dash only allows consumers to push a button to order new products, but Wal-Mart’s sensor tech will track how often a product is used, where it spends time around the house, and what the consumer might purchase next. Rather than consciously pushing Dash buttons to order products, this is a much more passive approach. According to Wal-Mart’s patent filing, the consumer wouldn’t manually push a button. Instead, the data will signal a need for more products. It’s kind of like a subscription service, but it only comes when the product is actually needed. The patent application used the example of an article of clothing. Each article could be tagged and tracked to see how many times the product is worn and washed. This will indicate the need for new clothing and other household items like laundry detergent. Once it reaches the base threshold pre-determined by the manufacturer, it will automatically order these new products. It also mentioned a gallon of milk. When the carton reaches its “sell by” date, it will send a series of alerts. The first would remind the owner to drink the remainder quickly before it goes bad and the second would be a reminder to order new milk. When compared with Amazon Dash, this is a very good idea. The Dash buttons were expensive and annoying at best. They weren’t attractive to place around your home, and if you forget to press the button, you’ll be out of whatever product you need before the new item arrives. Wal-Mart’s technology will be hidden within the product. It will be nearly invisible and will send alerts to remind you to make purchases. The price of such a product isn’t clear since the patent hasn’t been cleared, but consumers are hopeful that, per Wal-Mart’s usual, the products will be more affordable than the Dash buttons. It’s important to recognize that this is just a patent filing, as of now. Many patents never go on to be real products, so there is a small chance that we won’t see this come to fruition. However, knowing Wal-Mart’s desire to remain competitive with Amazon, it wouldn’t be surprising to see this product on the market in the next couple of years. Additionally, Wal-Mart’s brand is just as strong, if not stronger than Amazon’s brand. People have come to recognize the consistency, low cost, and reliability of Wal-Mart’s brand, and that could single-handedly carry forth the popularity of their products. Their highly recognizable brand makes any product more familiar, giving them a jumpstart that could truly compete against Amazon’s Dash button. It shouldn’t be long before this device emerges. The patent was filed in October and made public just last week. If this device develops, as it’s very likely to do so, we’ll see a fiercely competitive battle between the largest online retailer and the biggest brick-and-mortar retail chain in the world.

Hong AP File/May 9, 2013 Business Monday May 12, 2017 7:00 AM In the week ahead, watch Walmart’s strategy to combat the Amazon effect BY TOM HUDSON Special to the Miami Herald LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story If the rumors of the death of retail are true, don’t tell it to the customers and shareholders of Walmart. Names like hhgregg, Limited Stores and Wet Seal have declared bankruptcy, setting a record pace this year for retailers going broke. Others, such as Macy’s, JCPenney’s and Urban Outfitters, are closing some stores. But wait. Unemployment is low. Consumer confidence is strong and credit card debt is as high as it has been since the end of the Great Recession. Shoppers clearly are buyers. And we are still buying the same stuff — furniture, clothes, toys — but how and where we are buying is changing. This is the Amazon effect. While it is hurting some retailers, it isn’t killing retail. Monthly retail sales were up 5 percent in March. That includes in-store and online, including mobile. Sure, e-commerce is growing faster, but retailers keep stocking their shelves and we keep consuming. It’s relevancy and price competition that injure and kill retailers. Just ask Sears or RadioShack. Related content Walmart sells more than $1 billion of merchandise per day. In the week ahead, the company is scheduled to release its first quarter financial results on Thursday. This is the first quarter since Walmart canceled the effort to compete directly against Amazon Prime’s free two-day shipping service. Instead, Walmart’s newest strategy to battle the Amazon effect is just a few weeks old. In April, Walmart began discounting items shoppers buy online and pick up in stores. Investors will want to hear about any early results and plans to expand the service this quarter. This year, Walmart stock has been a better investment than the S&P 500 Stock Index.

Stephen Chernin/Getty Images Never underestimate the role shipping plays in e-commerce. Walmart and Amazon have been vying to become the habit-forming online retailer for American shoppers, and Amazon has enjoyed a comfortable first-mover advantage for much of that time. The two have engaged in rival shopping-event days (Walmart rolled out a huge sale in response to Amazon’s made-up Prime Day holiday), rival grocery services, rival subscription-goods services, and a race to the bottom of how little consumers have to spend to get items shipped for free. In the latest move, Amazon.com lowered its free shipping threshold to $25 from $35, lower than Walmart.com’s minimum purchase for free shipping by $10. So what? For consumers, free shipping for a package en route is nice, but they may begin paying attention to the cost of returning a package. Amazon offers free returns on the clothing and shoes orders it fulfills, but if you’ve purchased an item fulfilled by a third-party vendor, you’re at the mercy of the vendor. A cursory survey of clothing or shoe offerings shows free returns are clearly marked on Amazon fulfillment, while third-party fulfillment and return policies require an extra click or two. Walmart.com has a similar policy—and the added advantage of having a network of stores that shoppers can walk in and items for quick returns, refunds and exchanges. This will be great for suburban, exurban and rural e-commerce customers: One of the appealing traits of e-commerce is its ability to deliver stuff that’s hard-to-find in your area. But if that hard-to-find stuff is not to your liking, being able to return it should be nearly as frictionless as buying it was. Who cares? Environmental types have their eyes on e-commerce as a whole. Emissions nightmares from idling delivery trucks aside, e-commerce has disrupted traditional supply chain models—everything from inventory management and storage to packaging to fulfillment to returns. There are opportunities at every link in the chain to adopt sustainable practices. For example, changing the packaging can reduce overall resources consumed and the number of damaged deliveries and returns for the retailer. Here’s how luggage maker TOM BIHN does it: The company now uses shipping boxes made of recycled cardboard that are right-sized to prevent the use of excess materials and crush tested to prevent product damage, as well as to reduce the rate of return shipments. Additionally, TOM BIHN ships every order via UPS carabon neutral, where carbon offsets are purchased to balance out the emissions produced by the transportation of shipments.  There is no blithe assurance that e-commerce is actually better for the environment. Experts are still balancing the packaging and transit demands against the transit resources used when people drive to stores to get stuff and the new supply chains and inventory practices against the way retailers used to operate. The shipping wars among e-commerce players present opportunities for consumers to get their goods cheaply and for retailers to grab a larger share of regular spenders. They may also be a surprising prompt to look at the logistics systems that undergird modern American life. Want more?

Tech Apple Science Cars Samsung Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 Nintendo NES E3     Nintendo Switch In Stock At Walmart Online Store At 5pm ET Today Posted: May 12 2017, 4:12pm CDT | by Luigi Lugmayr, in News | Technology News     The chances are extremely high that Walmart's online store will sell the Nintendo Switch today. Updated. The Walmart online shop has restocked the Nintendo Switch on a Friday for six weeks in a row. Walmart's Nintendo Switch flash sale started usually around 5pm ET. Don't Miss: Nintendo Switch with Gray Joy-Con in Stock Online Updates: 5:01pm ET: It happened again. The Nintendo Switch was available for purchase at walmart.com. Our Tracker app noticed the availability and I was able to order a Nintendo Switch with Neon Joy-Con for $299.99 through the Walmart app. Ordering the Switch without the bundle only worked through the Walmart shopping app. The delivery date on my order is May 17. We will start a giveaway as soon as this Switch arrives. The Switch sale at walmart.com was sold out in less than 5 minutes. 1:45pm ET: Our Tracker just noticed that Walmart removed the market place offers from the stand-alone Nintendo Switch consoles product pages. The $299 Nintendo Switch with Gray Joy-Con and the Nintendo Switch with Neon Joy-Con are now listed to be shipped and sold from Walmart, but still marked out of stock.  It is extremely likely that Walmart will again offer the Nintendo Switch as part of a bundle with a game and accessory today at the same time. The Nintendo Switch bundles start at reasonable $365.65. The most expensive combination of game and accessory is $438.87, which is still lower priced than the Nintendo Switch bundles sold in the GameStop online shop. Last week it was possible to order the $299 Switch console as well and not just the bundle, through the Walmart app. It was not possible through the online store. Maybe this will be different today. Walmart has offered four choices of Switch games including Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and four choices of accessories including the Switch Pro controller. The choices could change in today's Switch sale on walmart.com. The Walmart Switch bundles do not include any fluff stuff and give buyers the choice which items to include, making the offer very popular and sell out fast. To beat shopping bots and other customers to the punch, shoppers need to hit the buy button as soon as the sale begins. Today is therefore a big test for our new online stock tracking app "The Tracker." The Tracker will issue a notification on your smartphone as soon as the Nintendo Switch bundle is available on walmart.com. I am truly excited to find out how fast our app will be able to detect the begin of the Switch sale.  Download our free The Tracker app, available for iOS and Android now. From the list products you see when starting up the app, just select the Walmart Switch bundle at the end of the list. Yes. We work on better list management. Tap the checkmark on the listing and that's it. Find online inventory with The Tracker app is set and forget. At the moment our servers detect a product in stock, you receive a notification on your smartphone. Tap the notification and click the view button to go directly to the offer of the online store for the Nintendo Switch with Gray Joy-Con. With our online inventory tracking app you do not have to keep browser windows open to get notified. You can go on about your life and just get alerted with notification to act now on an available offer of the product you seek online.  For extreme hard to find products, timing is everything. There is nothing faster than a smartphone notification. Tracking online inventory is no exact science. Retailers are not that forthcoming with real-time inventory information. There are lots of hoops to jump through to get timely in stock updates.  We continue to work tirelessly to make the Tracker by I4U News the fastest online inventory tracker. To achieve this goal, we need your help. Please tell us about your experience with the Tracker app in the Community tab of the app. To get an overview of the product we currently track inventory online, visit the web version of The Tracker. Download The Tracker for the Apple iPhone and for Android Phones now. To prepare for the Nintendo Switch sale at walmart.com, please make sure you are logged into your walmart store account. Verify that your credit card information is correct.  Some customers who ordered a Nintendo Switch in the past weeks at walmart.com shared on social media that they did not receive the Switch consoles yet. Especially the Neon consoles are affected. It is not clear how wide-spread the issue is, but Walmart would not offer a weekly sale of the Nintendo Switch if they did not receive new inventory. Would be a strange thing to do.

Continue Reading Below U.S. District Judge Susan Hickey in Fayetteville, Arkansas, said McMillon's "direct and personal involvement" in matters underlying a class-action lawsuit justified requiring him to sit for a deposition by the shareholders' lawyers. McMillon had been president of Wal-Mart International during a period when shareholders led by a Michigan pension fund said the retailer concealed suspected bribery by its Wal-Mart de Mexico unit to government officials, to speed up store openings. The Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer had argued that McMillon lacked the "unique or special knowledge" to justify burdening him with a deposition. But the judge said McMillon, who became chief executive in February 2014, took part in several meetings, saw dozens of communications, and had certified many public statements by Wal-Mart about the alleged bribery. "It appears to the court that McMillon has unique knowledge of relevant issues in this litigation that only he can explain," Hickey wrote. A deposition could last four hours, she added. Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT Wal-Mart spokesman Randy Hargrove said: "We are reviewing the order and contemplating our next steps." Jason Forge, a lawyer for the lead plaintiff City of Pontiac General Employees' Retirement System, said in an email: "We're determined to try this case in court." Wal-Mart's market value slid $17 billion over three days in April 2012 after the New York Times reported the alleged bribery and said it had been first discovered internally in 2005. Shareholders accused Wal-Mart and Mike Duke, who preceded McMillon as chief executive, of downplaying the scheme even after learning about the Times' investigation. The class period runs from Dec. 8, 2011 to April 20, 2012. Earlier this week, Bloomberg News said Wal-Mart may pay about $300 million to settle a U.S. government probe into suspected bribery in Mexico, India and China, citing people familiar with the matter. A $300 million payment would represent about one week of profit for Wal-Mart. The case is City of Pontiac General Employees' Retirement System v. Wal-Mart Stores Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Western District of Arkansas, No. 12-05162.   (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Tom Brown and Marguerita Choy) Fox Business Markets Politics Features FBN TV About Fox Business Channel Finder Advertise With Us Jobs Internships New Terms of Use (What's new) New Privacy Policy FAQ Media Relations Closed Captioning Policy Accessibility Statement Quotes delayed at least 15 minutes.

Sears, once the monolith of American retail, says that there is "substantial doubt" that it will be able to keep its doors open. (AP Photo/John Minchillo) The Associated Press Sears signage is shown on its department store in Brooklyn's Flatbush neighborhood, Wednesday, March 22, 2017, in New York. Sears, once the monolith of American retail, says that there is "substantial doubt" that it will be able to keep its doors open. Company shares tumbled more than 12 percent Wednesday. (AP Photo/Bebeto Matthews) In 1989, Sears Roebuck & Co. ruled America as its biggest retailer. It loomed over rivals from a perch high above Chicago, inside what was once the world’s tallest building — one bearing the company’s name. The fall from that height may finally be nearing an end. Over the course of almost three decades, the company experienced what industry observers described as one of the most monumental collapses in business history. Despite its union with Kmart — the second-largest retailer from that era — and a stated belief that it can still turn things around, Sears is teetering on the edge of disaster. The latest bad news was revealed in March, when Sears acknowledged “substantial doubt” about its future, sending the stock plummeting, its worst decline in more than two years. S&P Global Market Intelligence declared Sears the U.S. retailer most vulnerable to defaulting in the next year. A Fitch Ratings study of retail bankruptcies also listed it as a company with a high risk of failure. The combined decline of Sears and Kmart, in terms of sales, is unprecedented, said Greg Portell, an analyst at A.T. Kearney. The seeds were planted by poor decision-making in the 1980s, during which time the company made a real estate play instead of focusing on selling. No senior executive over the next 28 years was able to put stops in place to prevent the slide. “The management mistake that Sears made, in retrospect, was that they never got to a spot where they could stop the free fall,” Portell said. It has been a slow, painful fall for these once-dominant brands. Sears, in particular, was synonymous with suburban American consumerism. It dominated the retail industry and changed the way people shopped through its revolutionary catalog business — the Amazon.com of its era. Kmart accomplished a lot as well, rising to a spot right behind Sears by peppering the nation with its Super Center big box shops and luring droves of shoppers with the promise of deep discounts, including, of course, the Blue Light Special. In 1994, Sears and Kmart raked in a combined $111.4 billion, compared with powerhouse discounter Wal-Mart Stores Inc.’s haul of $111.9 billion. All three retailers ranked in the top 15 in revenue, among companies in all industries, in 1995. Since then, they’ve gone in different directions. Sears and Kmart have watched their customer bases shrink amid a never-ending string of store closures. Wal-Mart’s sales grew almost fourfold over the next decade, as the behemoth tripled its locations and embarked on mass international expansion. Sears and Kmart each chose to trudge along, with little change in strategy. In 2002, Kmart filed for bankruptcy protection after years of weak sales and stiff competition from Wal-Mart. The chain and its 2,100 stores were in dire shape, gasping under a pile of debt while unable to get enough shoppers through the doors. At one point, Kmart’s biggest food distributor stopped shipments after the retailer was unable to make payments. Kmart would emerge from bankruptcy under the control of hedge fund billionaire Eddie S. Lampert and his firm, ESL Investments. Then came the merger, then the biggest tie-up in the annals of retail. Since then, Sears and Kmart have been slowly dismantled by Lampert. Implementing a culture of warring tribes, one in which divisions would battle it out for resources, little cash was funneled back into reviving physical stores. Chunks of the business were sold to keep the lights on. In January, the company sold the famous tool brand Craftsman to Stanley Black & Decker Inc. for about $900 million. Who's hired? Check our People in Business Here are the best large places to work in St. Louis Get the Bottom Line from Nicklaus and Gallagher Company headquarters that have moved from St. Louis “He did nothing to maintain the stores — nothing to spiff them up and make them a nice place to go shopping,” said Robin Lewis, a longtime industry analyst and chief executive of the Robin Report. “You’ve got young people today that don’t even recognize Sears as a place where they would go. I think people will just forget about it.” On Wednesday, at the Sears Holdings shareholders’ meeting, Lampert blamed “irresponsible” media coverage for the company’s struggles. Once, Sears was the disruptor — not the disrupted. When the Sears catalog first appeared on doorsteps in the 1890s, it fundamentally changed how Americans shopped. Back then, much of the population lived in rural areas, and they bought almost everything from little shops at rural junctions. These general stores had limited selection and charged exorbitant prices. They were the only game in town. “The Sears catalog had an even bigger impact in 1900 than Amazon has had today,” said Robert Gordon, a professor at Northwestern University and author of “The Rise and Fall of American Growth.” Like today’s e-commerce powerhouse, the Sears catalog provided shoppers more choice than ever, and at lower prices. Sears freed shoppers from the tyranny of the local general merchant and improved their living standards. “The cost of living went down the minute Sears became available,” Gordon said. Searching for parallels of Sears’s fall through business history, Gordon could find none. “There is nothing like the decline of Sears and Kmart,” he said.

Police arrested Denise Shala Joy Farmer after she checked into the Beachcomber Motel and had numerous televisions and laptop computers in their original packaging. She was arrested without incident, and was found to have multiple outstanding arrest warrants from four Oregon counties, said Gold Beach Sgt. Tracy Wood. Found in the hotel room were big-screen televisions, laptops, printers and other electronics valued at more than $2,000 and purchased from a Walmart in Newport. They also found several bank cards, checks, checkbooks and other personal items, most of them belonging to Coos Bay area citizens. Some documents recovered might be linked to a residential burglary reported in March in Coos County, and a forged check was allegedly used to purchase items at a store in Gold Beach. Charges she might face include first-degree theft by receiving, identity theft, first-degree forgery and unlawful possession of methamphetamine. Other charges are pending for cases in Coos, Lane and Lincoln counties. 17228537 View next article in Local News print version The Curry Coastal Pilot This image is copyrighted.

"But on a case by case basis, there's still plenty to cheer about with individual stocks," the "Mad Money" host said. "Anything related to social, mobile, cloud, artificial intelligence, continues to get a boost. But anything related to physical bricks-and-mortar merchandising remains hopelessly disliked, with the once-stellar Nordstrom taking the group down again today." E-commerce and the cloud reign supreme, but with Deutsche Bank's downgrade of General Electric to a "sell" rating, it looks to Cramer like enterprise and individual spending is slowing. With these diverging forces in mind, here are the stocks and events on Cramer's radar next week: Monday: Trivago The hotel booking company will report its first quarter earnings. After sitting down with the CEO of its parent company, Expedia, Cramer felt good about Trivago's impending report. But after competitor Priceline's management team gave downbeat guidance in their earnings report, the "Mad Money" host became less certain about the strength of the travel arena. "Which is right? Expedia or Priceline? Rivals. Why don't we let Trivago decide, and if it's good, I suggest you go right back to the stock of Priceline at this discount, because it has been a monster long term winner over the years," Cramer said. Tuesday: Home Depot, Stanley Black & Decker, TJX Companies Home Depot: The home improvement giant kicks off the week's retail earnings with what Cramer expects to be a strong report. "I always encourage people to buy this stock, but not all at once because you know what? Home Depot, up here, [has] become quite volatile. So maybe you pick up some Monday and then some after they report," he advised. Stanley Black & Decker: An analyst meeting at this industrial tools manufacturer could prompt the stock to take off thanks to a recent wave of positive acquisitions and Home Depot's presumably strong tools sales, Cramer said. TJX: Off-priced goods have been the savior of this Cramer-fave retail company and parent of discount chains TJ Maxx and HomeGoods. "I've been waiting for the huge breakout that TJX will give us with all of these brick-and-mortar stores that are being closed, because they've got to offload their goods and they give them to TJX for cash, so they'll be able to sell name-brand stuff for even cheaper than you can get it on Amazon," Cramer said. "It has not happened yet. TJX's stock has been so-so. That said, I'm betting on a strong second half of the year and think you need to get in ahead of it." Wednesday: Target, Cisco, Rexnord Target: Even though some on Wall Street are predicting a turnaround for Target and blessing the stock because of its seemingly safe 4.3 percent yield, Cramer is not so convinced. "All I can say is that big dividends sure didn't do much good for the people who own shares of Kohl's or Macy's. So as tempting as Target might be, I am not going to sanction a buy of it," he said. Cisco: The software giant reports after the close, and while competition in the cybersecurity space has driven a lot of investors away from the stock, Cramer is sticking to his guns. "My charitable trust has owned Cisco for ages and we're going to ride it out given that CEO Chuck Robbins has been remaking this company as a soup to nuts offering for any enterprise that's trying to embrace the internet of things in a secure way," the "Mad Money" host said. Rexnord: President Donald Trump has been targeting this manufacturing company on Twitter for moving jobs to Mexico, and Cramer wants to see if it will respond at all in its earnings report. Thursday: Wal-Mart, Alibaba, Applied Materials, Salesforce.com Wal-Mart: Of all the companies vying to compete with Amazon, Cramer thinks Wal-Mart may actually have a chance. The company will report before the opening bell and explain to shareholders how its brick-and-mortar stores and e-commerce subsidiary Jet.com are boosting business and giving Amazon a run for its money. "I think it's too early to tell, of course, if they'll win, but the stock, after languishing for ages, has become a big winner, up almost 10 percent for the year. Wal-Mart, in the end, is a bargain store, and what really matters is that bargain stores are working in this environment," Cramer said. Alibaba: This e-commerce giant will report earnings, and it is the only Chinese stock Cramer recommends for the simple reason that business is booming. "They have a very good handle on e-commerce, perhaps second only to Amazon, and, of course, their home market in the People's Republic is incredibly strong," the "Mad Money" host said. Applied Materials: In the golden age of semiconductors, a company that makes machines that make the chips should be strong as ever, so Cramer expects a good earnings report. Salesforce.com: Yet another tech name benefiting from the rise of the cloud, Cramer expects excellent numbers from Salesforce's earnings report. "Remember, the stock does act weirdly, though, even on good quarters, so don't attempt to trade it. Just own it," Cramer advised. Friday: Deere & Company, Foot Locker, Honeywell Deere: For ages, anything the agriculture machinery company reported meant very little to the market, even if management insisted things were looking up. "Then one day, investor interest simply switched, and now whatever Deere says is greeted with adulation and any caveats are totally ignored. It's remarkable," Cramer said. "I suspect the stock goes higher again unless they tell us that they're shutting the company down. I mean, that's how much this story is loved." Foot Locker: Cramer says that this is one of two stores that is bucking negativity around mall-based retail. After Kohl's management said business from Under Armour and Nike was good and Adidas reported a strong quarter, Cramer expects positive things from Foot Locker's report. Honeywell: Friday's analyst meeting at this multinational will be the first one run by new President and CEO Darius Adamczyk. After hedge fund manager Daniel Loeb's activist fund suggested the company split, Cramer is curious to hear Adamczyk's thoughts on the matter. Cramer's bottom line? "I think that when earnings are finished, maybe Wall Street will start focusing on the White House again, if they can focus themselves. Right now, though, the only thing this market cares about is the numbers," Cramer said. "If the numbers are good, stocks go up regardless of the Comey fracas or the state of the Russia probe. And if they're bad, they get taken to the woodshed, or even go straight into the chipper-shredder."

Strongsville, Wadsworth, Chardon, Elyria, and Avon are the only locations in the Cleveland area that offer the free service. Strongsville’s Store Manager Robert Christmas said by next spring all Cleveland area locations will have it.   “First day, we had 17 customers use the service and (Friday) we had another 15 customers use the service -- so starting off slow but steady,” said Christmas. To use the service customers have to go to walmart.com/grocery and then order the items they want. When the order is ready the store calls the customer, and then brings it to their car. Busy mom Siovhon Kurtz said the pick-up service makes it easier for her to go shopping with her young son. “I was able to shop from my couch last night,” said Kurtz. Christmas said that home delivery is something that the company is exploring for the future. Download the Cleveland 19 News app and First Alert Weather app. Copyright 2017 WOIO. All rights reserved.

Choosing when or where you buy one can save you lots of money, or reward you with free accessories. We’ve done the hard work for you, and below is a continuously updated list of the best Galaxy S8 deals. Like, buy one get one free, $100 off, to a free microSD card and Netflix subscription. The Galaxy S8 is available from all major carriers in the United States and around the globe. It’s also for sale at Target, Best Buy, Wal-Mart and Sam’s Club retail stores. Read: What Galaxy S8 Color to Buy: Black, Gray or Silver? While Samsung’s free Gear VR and controller deal has ended, a brand new Entertainment Kit took its place. Where everyone who buys the phone gets some free accessories. Additionally, each carrier has their own savings you’ll want to know about. Galaxy S8 Deals For Everyone First things first, is the free Samsung Gear VR and motion controller. This was available to anyone that pre-ordered the Galaxy S8 or S8+. That’s $129 for the headset and $39 for the controller, absolutely free. If you pre-ordered before April 20th you’ll need to redeem your free gift. Here are the full instructions on how to get it and what you need to know.   Additionally, for a limited time, buyers can also get Samsung’s new premium over-the-ear headphones by AKG and a 256GB memory card for $99. You can choose the headphones and microSD card or the free Gear VR. A 256GB micro-SD card alone costs more than $99, making this the better deal of the two. Then, those who use Samsung Pay will instantly be eligible for platinum status with the Samsung Rewards program. Where you can earn points for using Samsung Pay. Galaxy S8 Entertainment Kit Deal If you buy the Galaxy S8 or S8+ between May 3rd and May 16th, Samsung will give you a free 64GB Samsung EVO microSD card, six months of Netflix and the Samsung Clear-View Kickstand case for free. Registration begins on May 5th in the Shop Samsung app. Once downloaded tap the 3-lines menu button, and head to Promotions. Look for “Entertainment Kit” and fill out the required forms. If you’re interested, submit the required forms before June 30th. Best Buy Galaxy S8 Deals Perhaps the best deal we’ve seen yet is directly from Best Buy. Order the phone in-store and get $50 off or $100 off the Galaxy S8+. Those taking advantage of carrier deals are still eligible for all savings when purchased at Best Buy. Additionally, Best Buy is giving out the same Gear VR deal along with free VR apps and games. A bundle worth $250 just for picking one up at Best Buy stores. Verizon Galaxy S8 Deals The Galaxy S8 is 50% off with an eligible trade-in at Verizon Wireless. Otherwise, it will cost $720 outright, or $840 for the Galaxy S8+. Potential buyers can also choose a monthly payment agreement. To be eligible simply trade in a smartphone that’s less than 2-years old and sign up for a new Verizon unlimited plan. This instantly cuts the price in half for Verizon customers. With a qualifying trade in and installment agreement plan, the Galaxy S8 will be $15 per month for 24 months, which is $360 total. Then, the same deal applies to the S8+ and payments will be $20 a month for 24 months which is $480 total. Instead of paying $720 or $840. When you buy from carriers you will still be eligible for the free Netflix Entertainment Kit mentioned earlier. Sam’s Club Deals Buy the S8 from Sam’s Club on AT&T, Verizon or Sprint and get a free $150 gift card. This is in addition to the free Entertainment Kit. Sam’s club is temporarily waiving all signup fees. Click here for more details. AT&T Galaxy S8 Deals As expected AT&T has some deals including buy one get one free. It does come with strings attached, so pay attention to everything mentioned below. AT&T will also bundle other Samsung products at heavy discounts when you buy the Galaxy S8. Buy the Galaxy S8 and receive $750 in credits towards another Samsung Galaxy S8 or S8+ (get one free) The Samsung Gear S3 is only $49 with a 2-year service agreement Buy the S8 and get a Samsung Tab E or Samsung Gear S2 for only $0.99 when you activate a 2-year service agreement Basically, you can get two Galaxy S8 or S8+ phones for the price of one. Using this deal AT&T will pay the monthly payment on the second device for you. This only applies to the Galaxy S8. Those who choose the Galaxy S8+ will end up paying $100. The deal is only available if you sign up for AT&T Next and a DirecTV subscription or already use DirecTV. Click here for more details about this deal. Wal-Mart S8 Deals Head to Wal-Mart for prices lower than carriers or Samsung themselves. The regular Galaxy S8 is $659, and the bigger S8+ is only $759. As a comparison, most carriers have the S8+ for $840. Additionally, get the Galaxy S8 at Wal-Mart with an installment agreement for Verizon, AT&T or Sprint and get another $150 off. Sprint Galaxy Forever Deal & BOGO Like AT&T, Sprint is offering a buy one get one free deal. This is only available for the Galaxy S8, and not the bigger S8+. Get two while only paying for one at roughly $31 per month. Sprint will charge customers for the second one but will add $32 to your account each month — making it free. Make sure you read the fine print though, as you don’t own the phone. After 12 months Sprint will suggest owners upgrade to something new, like the Galaxy Note 8 or Galaxy S9. Sprint also offers what’s called the Galaxy Forever deal. How this works is you get the Galaxy S8 and make monthly payments toward the balance. After 12 payments Sprint will offer free upgrades to the next Galaxy device. Basically, the payments roll over the next year for a new phone. Additionally, Sprint is waiving activation fees and will enter Galaxy S8 buyers into a drawing to win a huge 65-inch Samsung HDTV and entertainment system. T-Mobile Galaxy S8 Deals Following other carrier footsteps, T-Mobile is now offering the S8 and S8+ as buy one and get one free. In order to get the deal, you’ll have to buy two on their no-interest Equipment Installment Plan. T-Mobile will then send you a prepaid visa card for the value of the second device. Buyers can then use this visa card to pay off the second phone. Up front, you will still pay $30 down for the S8, or $130 for the Galaxy S8+. Click here to get started. Other Details So far it looks like the best deal is trading in an old phone at Verizon and getting half off. Wal-Mart pricing is lower than most too, so keep that in mind. In the next couple of months, we anticipate other deals for the summertime and holidays. We will update this list as other deals and discounts become available, so check back often. In the meantime, learn more about both phones at our Galaxy S8 Portal.

The next round of retail earnings could change the tone after department-store disasters. The earnings season is the best in years, with more companies optimistic. Traders are watching China data and Fed surveys. Patti Domm | @pattidomm 8 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES Patrick T. Fallon | Bloomberg | Getty Images Butterball frozen turkeys are displayed for sale at a Wal-Mart Stores Inc. location ahead of Black Friday in Los Angeles, California, U.S., on Tuesday, Nov. 26, 2013. Earnings season saved the worst for last with a major retail bombshell, but now it will be up to Wal-Mart, TJX, Home Depot and others to change the industry's tone in the week ahead. Retailers always bring up the rear in earnings season, with more than 450 S&P 500 companies already reporting as of Friday. Feeling the continued pressure from online sales, department stores Macy's, Kohl's, Nordstrom and Dillard's soured what has been a strong earnings season. Their stocks continued to get slammed Friday, with Macy's down 18 percent for the week and Nordstrom down 16 percent. The big chains are being crushed by too much floor space, in a world where consumers are increasingly going online instead of to the mall. April's 0.4 percent gain in retail sales, while below estimates, still signaled that consumers are reasonably healthy but may have changed spending patterns. April online sales rose 1.4 percent. One bright spot was that March headline retail sales were revised higher to show a slight 0.1 percent gain, from a decline. Wal-Mart reports earnings this Thursday, and TJX and Home Depot report Tuesday in another week dominated by retailers' earnings. Of those three, only Wal-Mart is expected to see lower profits, with earnings per share down about 2 percent, according to Thomson Reuters. Off-price retailer TJX, down less than 2 percent for the week, may be a winner as the slide in department stores deepens. Retailer earnings/sales expectations for week of May 15 Source: Thomson Reuters Reports are also expected from discount chain Target, which has been struggling of late, and Gap and Urban Outfitters, both in the weak apparel space. Earnings for the S&P 500 companies so far are up nearly 15 percent, thanks in part to an outsized pop in energy earnings based on favorable comparisons for oil in the first quarter, according to Thomson Reuters. That's the best earnings growth since 2011. The afterglow of a strong earnings season could help support stocks in a week with little economic data. "You have to look at what's happening in the retail sector as an anomaly in the context of overall S&P 500 earnings," said Dan Suzuki, equity strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. He said companies are more confident in their earnings outlooks, though he believes this is the peak quarter for earnings gains, in part based on the energy bounce. "For the last two months in a row, you've seen more instances of companies guiding above expectations than below," he said. "That ratio of above versus below is almost double the historical average." The ratio of above-vs.-below consensus earnings guidance rose above 1.0 in both March and April, the highest levels since late 2014 and well above the long-term average of 0.6. BofA also studied earnings comments on conference calls to gauge the attitude of companies and finds that they are more upbeat than they've been in a long while. The use of the word "better," compared with uses of "worse" or "weaker," was at the highest level since 2010. Stocks managed to suffer relatively small losses in the past week even as retailers were ripped; social media stock Snap got whacked, and the big expected rebound in economic data was less significant than many hoped for. On top of that, there was one of the biggest ruckuses out of Washington since President Donald Trump entered the White House. Sideshow on the 'showboat' Washington in the past week put on one of the biggest sideshows yet over the president's firing of FBI Director James Comey, who was investigating the Trump campaign's ties to Russia. Trump said he'd been itching to fire him all along and that he was a "showboat" and "grandstander." But though the ill-timed firing created an explosion of criticism, lots of finger-pointing, and calls for a special prosecutor, stocks showed little impact. There was little fallout in markets. But the big risk is that the bipartisan and in some cases partisan squabbling over Comey could slow down efforts to move forward on a new health-care plan and tax reform. The prospect of tax reform has been supporting stock prices, though investors have been lowering their expectations for when it might be approved. Suzuki said investors are split over whether tax reform could happen this year or whether it will now be into next year. "It's 50-50 in terms of people who think it's going to get done this year," he said. If it starts looking like it will be later, rather than sooner, that's when the market could get hurt. "That's why we think, even though we have such a stellar first-quarter earnings season, the risk/rewards turn negative over the next several months. We think the market will turn higher at the end of the year, but between now and then there will be a lot of chop," he said. The VIX, CBOE's Volatility index, dipped to a decade low below 10 just before Comey's firing. By the end of the week it was just up to 10.40, still a very low level signaling lots of market complacency. It's not just stocks, as the low volatility has crept into currencies and bonds. The S&P 500 was down 0.3 percent for the week, at 2,390. The Nasdaq was positive, up 0.3 at 6,121. Treasury yields, which move inversely to prices, were lower on the week. The 2-year yield, which most reflects the activity of the Fed on interest rates, edged down to 1.28 percent. Suzuki said he expects stocks to end the year higher but he would not be surprised to see a 6 to 7 percent decline in the S&P, down to about 2,200. "You had the political support for optimism around tax reform. That's likely to fade in the coming months. You had the backdrop of improving global growth and confidence over the last couple of months. You've seen some of the major PMIs globally start to roll over," he said. Suzuki, like other analysts, is watching China to see if signs of slowing there increase. Industrial production and retail sales for China will be reported Sunday night, well ahead of the U.S. open Monday. In the U.S., there is Empire State manufacturing data Monday and the Philadelphia Fed survey Thursday. Both are important early indicators of the state of business activity in the second quarter.

The LA school board race may be the most expensive in the country with out-of-town billionaires – including the Walton family – trying to defeat progressive Steve Zimmer. By Peter Dreier / Huffington Post May 12, 2017 Print Comments Photo Credit: Walmart Corporate / Flickr Some of America’s most powerful corporate plutocrats want to take over the Los Angeles school system but Steve Zimmer, a former teacher and feisty school board member, is in their way. So they’ve hired Nick Melvoin to get rid of him. No, he’s not a hired assassin like the kind on “The Sopranos.” He’s a lawyer who the billionaires picked to defeat Zimmer. The so-called “Independent” campaign for Melvoin — funded by big oil, big tobacco, Walmart, Enron, and other out-of-town corporations and billionaires — has included astonishingly ugly, deceptive, and false attack ads against Zimmer. This morning (Friday) the Los Angeles Times reported that “Outside spending for Melvoin (and against Zimmer) has surpassed $4.65 million.” Why? Because he doesn’t agree with the corporatization of our public schools. Some of their donations have gone directly to Melvoin’s campaign, but much of it has been funneled through a corporate front group called the California Charter School Association. To try to hoodwink voters, the billionaires invented another front group with the same initials as the well-respected Parent Teacher Association, but they are very different organizations. They called it the “Parent Teacher Alliance.” Pretty clever, huh? But this is notthe real PTA, which does not get involved with elections. In fact, the real PTA has demanded that this special interest PAC change their name and called the billionaires’ campaign Zimmer “misleading,” “deceptive practices,” and “false advertising.” These out-of-town billionaire-funded groups can pay for everything from phone-banks, to mailers, to television ads. Los Angeles Times columnist Steve Lopez described the billionaires’ campaign to defeat Zimmer, which includes sending mails filled with outrageous lies about Zimmer, as “gutter politics.” As a result, the race for the District 4 seat — which stretches from the Westside to the West San Fernando Valley — is ground zero in the battle over the corporate take-over of public education. The outcome of next Tuesday’s (May 16) election has national implications in terms of the billionaires’ battle to reconstruct public education in the corporate mold. The contest between Melvoin and Zimmer is simple. Who should run our schools? Who knows what’s best for students? Out-of-town billionaires or parents, teachers, and community residents? Before examining just who these corporate carpetbaggers are, let’s look at who Steve Zimmer is, what he’s accomplished, and what he stands for. Zimmer grew up in a working class community and attended public schools. His father was a printer and his mother was a school teacher. After college, he became a teacher, beginning with Teach for America in 1992.  He spent 17 years as a teacher and counselor at Marshall High School. When he taught English as a second language, he used an experiential approach that related to his students’ daily lives. He created Marshall’s Public Service Program to make public service intrinsic to the student experience. He founded Marshall’s Multilingual Teacher Career Academy, which was an early model for LAUSD’s Career Ladder Teacher Academy.  To help address the concerns of at-risk youth, he founded the Comprehensive Student Support Center to provide health care services for students and their families. He helped create the Elysian Valley Community Services Center, a community owned-and-operated agency that provides after-school, recreational and enrichment programs, a library, and free Internet access. He was elected to the school board in 2009 and re-elected in 2013 despite the onslaught of billionaire bucks against him.  What are some of Zimmer’s most important accomplishments on the school board? • Improving student success. Zimmer’s leadership helped increase local graduation rates into their highest level ever. LAUSD schools achieved across-the-board improvements in state testing and all measurable forms of student achievement. • Balanced budgets. As school board president, Zimmer helped bring LAUSD’s budget into balance while simultaneously increasing funding to the classrooms. Zimmer helped lead the fight to get Congress to pass the Education Jobs Bill passed, which provided LAUSD with $300 million. He has fought for increased federal Special Education funding. He championed Proposition 30 and its extension, Proposition 55, which added more school funding for LAUSD. His stewardship has paid off. LAUSD has been awarded the highest credit rating of AAA. • More schools, more opportunities. As a result of Zimmer’s leadership and in response to parent interest, LAUSD has added many more magnet schools, STEM programs and dual immersion language programs. • Restoring arts education. Zimmer worked to restore arts programs not just in some schools but in all schools. He believes access to arts education needs to be a right for all students in every community. It is an essential component to a well-rounded education. Since he’s been in office, arts funding has increased by $18 million dollars and the Arts Equity Index that he championed, now ensures resources where they are needed the most. • Protecting vulnerable students. As a school board member, Zimmer has been the leading advocate for vulnerable students. He authored the school board resolution in support of the Dream Act, federal legislation that would provide a path to citizenship for undocumented students who do well in school and attend college. He authored the resolution ensuring schools are safe zones where students and families faced immigration enforcement actions can find safety and seek assistance and information. He helped create Student Recovery Day, a twice-yearly event that takes scores of district staff into students’ homes to support students who have dropped out. Hundreds of students have returned to class after being sought out and connected with the support services they need. He has ensured that the school district supports the needs of students living in poverty, students facing trauma, special education students, undocumented students, LGBT students, English Learners, standard English learners and foster children. • Healthy food. Zimmer’s commitment to making sure students eat healthy meals is unparalleled. His Good Food Purchasing resolution has been a model around the country for making sure student lunches have met the highest nutritional, environmental and animal welfare standards. As a member of the Board, and his last two years as President, Zimmer led the school district through difficult times, weathering a recession, dealing with tragedies, and transitions in leadership. He used his skills to resolve challenges by working collaboratively. Zimmer has received numerous awards for his work with children and families, including the LA’s Commission of Children, Youth and their Families “Angel Over Los Angeles” award, El Centro Del Pueblo’s “Carino” award and the LACER Foundation’s “Jackie Goldberg Public Service Award.” Nick Melvoin is the candidate completely sponsored by the 1 percent. His extreme lack of experience clearly doesn’t bother them. Melvoin is so devoted to the corporate agenda for our schools that he claims a “hostile takeover” is needed.  Who are some of the billionaires and corporate lobby groups that want to defeat Steve Zimmer and elect Nick Melvoin? • Members of the Walton family (Alice Walton, Jim Walton, and Carrie Walton Penner) — heirs to the Wal-Mart fortune from Arkansas — have contributed $2.2 million to the PAC attacking Zimmer in the last two years. Alice Walton (net worth: $36.9 billion) lives in Texas and is one of the biggest funders behind Melvoin’s campaign. She and other members of her family also donated to the Super PAC that worked to elect Donald Trump, donated to Mike Pence, Jeff Sessions, and to the Alliance for School Choice, an organization that Trump’s Education Secretary Betsy DeVos helped to lead.  • Oil and Enron executives from Texas and Oklahoma have contributed more than $1 million to the same committee. • JOBSPAC — a PAC “largely funded by oil and tobacco companies,” according to the Los Angeles Times – contributed $35,000 to the same committee funding the attacks on Zimmer.  • Doris Fisher, co-founder of The Gap who has a net worth of $2.7 billion, has given $4.1 million to the California Charter School Association’s political action committee in 2015 and 2016. She lives in San Francisco. • John Arnold made a fortune at Enron before the company collapsed, leaving its employees and stockholders in the lurch. Then he made another fortune as a hedge fund manager. His net worth is $2.9 billion. He and his wife Laura donated $1 million last year to CCSA’s political committee and $4400 directly to Melvoin. They live in Houston, Texas. • Jeff Yass, who lives in the Philadelphia suburbs, has given the maximum allowed contribution to Melvoin. He runs the Susquahanna group, a hedge fund. He has close ties to Betsy DeVos’ efforts to privatize public school. Yass donated $2.3 million to a Super PAC supporting Rand Paul’s presidential candidacy. • Frank Baxter and his wife Kathrine donated $100,000 to CCSA’s political committee in the past two years and $3,300 directly to Melvoin. Frank Baxter is former CEO of the global investment bank Jefferies and Company that specialized in “junk” bonds. He is a major Republican fundraiser and was appointed ambassador to Uruguay by George W. Bush. He is one of at least five donors to Melvoin’s campaign who sit on the board of charter schools. He is also a big financial backer of Republicans like House Speaker Paul Ryan, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, Cong. Devin Nunes of California, and Cong. Steve King of Iowa (a Tea Party favorite). What do these corporate moguls and billionaires want and what has Zimmer done to make them so upset? They want to turn public schools into educational Wal-marts run on the same corporate model. They want to expand charter schools that compete with each other and with public schools in an educational “market place.” (LA already has more charter schools than any other district in the country). They want to evaluate teachers and students like they evaluate new products — in this case, using the bottom-line of standardized test scores. Most teachers will tell you that over-emphasis on standardized testing turns the classroom into an assembly line, where teachers are pressured to “teach to the test,” and students are taught, robot-like, to define success as answering multiple-choice tests. Not surprisingly, the billionaires want school employees — teachers — to do what they’re told, without having much of a voice in how their workplace functions or what is taught in the classroom. Rather than treat teachers like professionals, they view them as the out-sourced hired help. The corporate big-wigs are part of an effort that they and the media misleadingly call “school reform.” What they’re really after is not “reform” (improving our schools for the sake of students) but “privatization” (business control of public education). They think public schools should be run like corporations, with teachers as compliant workers, students as products, and the school budget as a source of profitable contracts and subsidies for textbook companies, consultants, and others engaged in the big business of education. Like most reasonable educators and education analysts, Zimmer has questioned the efficacy of charter schools as a panacea. When the billionaires unveiled their secret plan to put half of LAUSD students into charter schools within eight years, Zimmer led the opposition. Zimmer isn’t against all charter schools but he doesn’t want the board to rubber-stamp every charter proposal. He wants LAUSD to carefully review each charter proposal to see if its backers have a track record of success and inclusion. And he wants LAUSD to hold charters accountable. This kind of reasonable approach doesn’t sit well with the billionaires behind their front group, the California Charter School Association.  Zimmer has also questioned the over-reliance on high-stakes standardized testing as the primary tool for assessing student and teacher performance. Testing has its place but it can also become an excuse to avoid more useful and holistic ways to evaluate students and teachers — and to avoid the “teach to the test” obsession that hampers learning and creative teaching. Zimmer has called for — and helped negotiate the deal for — some portion of teacher evaluations to include test scores. But that’s not what the billionaires want. As a former LAUSD teacher with 17 years in the classroom, Zimmer respects teachers as professionals. He understands the jobs and frustrations of teaching. He wants LAUSD to create schools that are truly partnerships between teachers, parents, students and the district. He is often allied with United Teachers Los Angeles, but he is nobody’s lapdog. He has always been an independent voice and has disagreed with UTLA on some significant matters. In fact, four years ago, Times’ columnist Lopez wrote that Zimmer “... has tried to bridge differences among the warring parties, winning supporters and making enemies on both sides in the process.” But the billionaires don’t want a bridge-builder. They want a compliant rubber stamp, and that’s what they’ve found in Nick Melvoin, the advocate for a “hostile takeover.” Zimmer is endorsed by many LAUSD parents and community activists as well as Mayor Eric Garcetti, Senator Bernie Sanders, Congressmembers Karen Bass, Judy Chu and Maxine Waters, City Attorney Mike Feuer and the Councilmembers serving the neighborhoods in his 4th School Board District. At the state level, State Superintendent Tom Torlakson, Secretary of State Alex Padilla, State Controller Betty Yee, Senate President Pro Tem Kevin De Leon, and Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon have all endorsed Zimmer. At the County level, he’s backed by Supervisors Hilda Solis and Sheila Kuehl along with former Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky. In his endorsement of Zimmer, Mayor Garcetti said: “The campaign against Steve has turned vicious, and I feel compelled to reach out on behalf of a champion for all our kids. I’ve worked closely with Steve Zimmer for more than 15 years. I’ve watched him make change in the lives of kids and in the fabric of our communities. Under Steve’s leadership, Los Angeles Unified schools have shown impressive progress. Steve’s collaborative, ‘all kids, all families’ approach is what we need on the School Board.”  The Los Angeles Unified School District is the second largest school system in the country with over 700,000 students. So gaining control of its board — and its budget — is a good “investment” for the billionaires who want to reshape education in this country. Melvoin’s campaign and backers have outspent Zimmer by a huge margin. Their battle has turned into a remarkable David vs. Goliath contest. But let’s recall who won that Biblical battle. Goliath had the big weapons but the feisty David had the slingshot. That’s how Zimmer beat another hand-picked billionaire-backed candidate four years ago, with a grassroots campaign that relied on parents, teachers, and neighborhood residents, and he’s hoping to do it again next Tuesday.   Peter Dreier is professor of politics and chair of the Urban & Environmental Policy Department at Occidental College.

Thomas, Getty Images) 18 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 3 COMMENTEMAILMORE The massive amount of rain that caused the devastating flooding in the past few weeks in Missouri was a rare 1-in-1,000-year event, meteorologists said Friday. Most of the “once-in-a-millennium” rainfall from late April to early May occurred in Texas and Howell counties in southern Missouri, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said. Some areas picked up over a foot of rain within a few hours April 29. "This incredible rainfall resulted in widespread and historic flooding," the National Weather Service in Springfield, Mo., said. "Numerous roads, bridges and buildings were destroyed." Other portions of the state, as well as parts of Illinois and Indiana, experienced less extreme rainfall, on the order of 1-in-200 and 1-in-500-year levels. A 1-in-1,000-year rain event is a statistical way of expressing the probability of such a massive rainfall occurring in any given year in a specific location, according to the National Center for Environmental Information, which is part of NOAA. And, it's the extreme rainfall amount in such a short amount of time that's the 1-in-1,000 year event, not the resulting floods, NOAA hydrologist Sanja Perica said. NWS has determined that portions of Texas, Howell, and Douglas Counties saw a 500 to 1000 year flood #MOwx#SGF#OzarksWx#FlashFloodpic.twitter.com/e8YghNShu9— NWS Springfield (@NWSSpringfield) May 12, 2017 This is at least the 10th "1-in-1,000" year rain event across the U.S. since 2010. While it's not yet known if climate change is to blame for each individual extreme rain event, heavy downpours are increasing nationally, especially over the past three to five decades, with the largest increases in the Midwest and Northeast, according to the National Climate Assessment, a federal document released in 2014. That means we're more likely to see 1-in-1,000-year rains as the planet warms, the Weather Channel said. FacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedIn Flooding swamps Midwest  Fullscreen Post to Facebook Posted!

The LA school board race may be the most expensive in the country with out-of-town billionaires – including the Walton family – trying to defeat progressive Steve Zimmer. By Peter Dreier / Huffington Post May 12, 2017 Print Comments Photo Credit: Walmart Corporate / Flickr Some of America’s most powerful corporate plutocrats want to take over the Los Angeles school system but Steve Zimmer, a former teacher and feisty school board member, is in their way. So they’ve hired Nick Melvoin to get rid of him. No, he’s not a hired assassin like the kind on “The Sopranos.” He’s a lawyer who the billionaires picked to defeat Zimmer. The so-called “Independent” campaign for Melvoin — funded by big oil, big tobacco, Walmart, Enron, and other out-of-town corporations and billionaires — has included astonishingly ugly, deceptive, and false attack ads against Zimmer. This morning (Friday) the Los Angeles Times reported that “Outside spending for Melvoin (and against Zimmer) has surpassed $4.65 million.” Why? Because he doesn’t agree with the corporatization of our public schools. Some of their donations have gone directly to Melvoin’s campaign, but much of it has been funneled through a corporate front group called the California Charter School Association. To try to hoodwink voters, the billionaires invented another front group with the same initials as the well-respected Parent Teacher Association, but they are very different organizations. They called it the “Parent Teacher Alliance.” Pretty clever, huh? But this is notthe real PTA, which does not get involved with elections. In fact, the real PTA has demanded that this special interest PAC change their name and called the billionaires’ campaign Zimmer “misleading,” “deceptive practices,” and “false advertising.” These out-of-town billionaire-funded groups can pay for everything from phone-banks, to mailers, to television ads. Los Angeles Times columnist Steve Lopez described the billionaires’ campaign to defeat Zimmer, which includes sending mails filled with outrageous lies about Zimmer, as “gutter politics.” As a result, the race for the District 4 seat — which stretches from the Westside to the West San Fernando Valley — is ground zero in the battle over the corporate take-over of public education. The outcome of next Tuesday’s (May 16) election has national implications in terms of the billionaires’ battle to reconstruct public education in the corporate mold. The contest between Melvoin and Zimmer is simple. Who should run our schools? Who knows what’s best for students? Out-of-town billionaires or parents, teachers, and community residents? Before examining just who these corporate carpetbaggers are, let’s look at who Steve Zimmer is, what he’s accomplished, and what he stands for. Zimmer grew up in a working class community and attended public schools. His father was a printer and his mother was a school teacher. After college, he became a teacher, beginning with Teach for America in 1992.  He spent 17 years as a teacher and counselor at Marshall High School. When he taught English as a second language, he used an experiential approach that related to his students’ daily lives. He created Marshall’s Public Service Program to make public service intrinsic to the student experience. He founded Marshall’s Multilingual Teacher Career Academy, which was an early model for LAUSD’s Career Ladder Teacher Academy.  To help address the concerns of at-risk youth, he founded the Comprehensive Student Support Center to provide health care services for students and their families. He helped create the Elysian Valley Community Services Center, a community owned-and-operated agency that provides after-school, recreational and enrichment programs, a library, and free Internet access. He was elected to the school board in 2009 and re-elected in 2013 despite the onslaught of billionaire bucks against him.  What are some of Zimmer’s most important accomplishments on the school board? • Improving student success. Zimmer’s leadership helped increase local graduation rates into their highest level ever. LAUSD schools achieved across-the-board improvements in state testing and all measurable forms of student achievement. • Balanced budgets. As school board president, Zimmer helped bring LAUSD’s budget into balance while simultaneously increasing funding to the classrooms. Zimmer helped lead the fight to get Congress to pass the Education Jobs Bill passed, which provided LAUSD with $300 million. He has fought for increased federal Special Education funding. He championed Proposition 30 and its extension, Proposition 55, which added more school funding for LAUSD. His stewardship has paid off. LAUSD has been awarded the highest credit rating of AAA. • More schools, more opportunities. As a result of Zimmer’s leadership and in response to parent interest, LAUSD has added many more magnet schools, STEM programs and dual immersion language programs. • Restoring arts education. Zimmer worked to restore arts programs not just in some schools but in all schools. He believes access to arts education needs to be a right for all students in every community. It is an essential component to a well-rounded education. Since he’s been in office, arts funding has increased by $18 million dollars and the Arts Equity Index that he championed, now ensures resources where they are needed the most. • Protecting vulnerable students. As a school board member, Zimmer has been the leading advocate for vulnerable students. He authored the school board resolution in support of the Dream Act, federal legislation that would provide a path to citizenship for undocumented students who do well in school and attend college. He authored the resolution ensuring schools are safe zones where students and families faced immigration enforcement actions can find safety and seek assistance and information. He helped create Student Recovery Day, a twice-yearly event that takes scores of district staff into students’ homes to support students who have dropped out. Hundreds of students have returned to class after being sought out and connected with the support services they need. He has ensured that the school district supports the needs of students living in poverty, students facing trauma, special education students, undocumented students, LGBT students, English Learners, standard English learners and foster children. • Healthy food. Zimmer’s commitment to making sure students eat healthy meals is unparalleled. His Good Food Purchasing resolution has been a model around the country for making sure student lunches have met the highest nutritional, environmental and animal welfare standards. As a member of the Board, and his last two years as President, Zimmer led the school district through difficult times, weathering a recession, dealing with tragedies, and transitions in leadership. He used his skills to resolve challenges by working collaboratively. Zimmer has received numerous awards for his work with children and families, including the LA’s Commission of Children, Youth and their Families “Angel Over Los Angeles” award, El Centro Del Pueblo’s “Carino” award and the LACER Foundation’s “Jackie Goldberg Public Service Award.” Nick Melvoin is the candidate completely sponsored by the 1 percent. His extreme lack of experience clearly doesn’t bother them. Melvoin is so devoted to the corporate agenda for our schools that he claims a “hostile takeover” is needed.  Who are some of the billionaires and corporate lobby groups that want to defeat Steve Zimmer and elect Nick Melvoin? • Members of the Walton family (Alice Walton, Jim Walton, and Carrie Walton Penner) — heirs to the Wal-Mart fortune from Arkansas — have contributed $2.2 million to the PAC attacking Zimmer in the last two years. Alice Walton (net worth: $36.9 billion) lives in Texas and is one of the biggest funders behind Melvoin’s campaign. She and other members of her family also donated to the Super PAC that worked to elect Donald Trump, donated to Mike Pence, Jeff Sessions, and to the Alliance for School Choice, an organization that Trump’s Education Secretary Betsy DeVos helped to lead.  • Oil and Enron executives from Texas and Oklahoma have contributed more than $1 million to the same committee. • JOBSPAC — a PAC “largely funded by oil and tobacco companies,” according to the Los Angeles Times – contributed $35,000 to the same committee funding the attacks on Zimmer.  • Doris Fisher, co-founder of The Gap who has a net worth of $2.7 billion, has given $4.1 million to the California Charter School Association’s political action committee in 2015 and 2016. She lives in San Francisco. • John Arnold made a fortune at Enron before the company collapsed, leaving its employees and stockholders in the lurch. Then he made another fortune as a hedge fund manager. His net worth is $2.9 billion. He and his wife Laura donated $1 million last year to CCSA’s political committee and $4400 directly to Melvoin. They live in Houston, Texas. • Jeff Yass, who lives in the Philadelphia suburbs, has given the maximum allowed contribution to Melvoin. He runs the Susquahanna group, a hedge fund. He has close ties to Betsy DeVos’ efforts to privatize public school. Yass donated $2.3 million to a Super PAC supporting Rand Paul’s presidential candidacy. • Frank Baxter and his wife Kathrine donated $100,000 to CCSA’s political committee in the past two years and $3,300 directly to Melvoin. Frank Baxter is former CEO of the global investment bank Jefferies and Company that specialized in “junk” bonds. He is a major Republican fundraiser and was appointed ambassador to Uruguay by George W. Bush. He is one of at least five donors to Melvoin’s campaign who sit on the board of charter schools. He is also a big financial backer of Republicans like House Speaker Paul Ryan, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, Cong. Devin Nunes of California, and Cong. Steve King of Iowa (a Tea Party favorite). What do these corporate moguls and billionaires want and what has Zimmer done to make them so upset? They want to turn public schools into educational Wal-marts run on the same corporate model. They want to expand charter schools that compete with each other and with public schools in an educational “market place.” (LA already has more charter schools than any other district in the country). They want to evaluate teachers and students like they evaluate new products — in this case, using the bottom-line of standardized test scores. Most teachers will tell you that over-emphasis on standardized testing turns the classroom into an assembly line, where teachers are pressured to “teach to the test,” and students are taught, robot-like, to define success as answering multiple-choice tests. Not surprisingly, the billionaires want school employees — teachers — to do what they’re told, without having much of a voice in how their workplace functions or what is taught in the classroom. Rather than treat teachers like professionals, they view them as the out-sourced hired help. The corporate big-wigs are part of an effort that they and the media misleadingly call “school reform.” What they’re really after is not “reform” (improving our schools for the sake of students) but “privatization” (business control of public education). They think public schools should be run like corporations, with teachers as compliant workers, students as products, and the school budget as a source of profitable contracts and subsidies for textbook companies, consultants, and others engaged in the big business of education. Like most reasonable educators and education analysts, Zimmer has questioned the efficacy of charter schools as a panacea. When the billionaires unveiled their secret plan to put half of LAUSD students into charter schools within eight years, Zimmer led the opposition. Zimmer isn’t against all charter schools but he doesn’t want the board to rubber-stamp every charter proposal. He wants LAUSD to carefully review each charter proposal to see if its backers have a track record of success and inclusion. And he wants LAUSD to hold charters accountable. This kind of reasonable approach doesn’t sit well with the billionaires behind their front group, the California Charter School Association.  Zimmer has also questioned the over-reliance on high-stakes standardized testing as the primary tool for assessing student and teacher performance. Testing has its place but it can also become an excuse to avoid more useful and holistic ways to evaluate students and teachers — and to avoid the “teach to the test” obsession that hampers learning and creative teaching. Zimmer has called for — and helped negotiate the deal for — some portion of teacher evaluations to include test scores. But that’s not what the billionaires want. As a former LAUSD teacher with 17 years in the classroom, Zimmer respects teachers as professionals. He understands the jobs and frustrations of teaching. He wants LAUSD to create schools that are truly partnerships between teachers, parents, students and the district. He is often allied with United Teachers Los Angeles, but he is nobody’s lapdog. He has always been an independent voice and has disagreed with UTLA on some significant matters. In fact, four years ago, Times’ columnist Lopez wrote that Zimmer “... has tried to bridge differences among the warring parties, winning supporters and making enemies on both sides in the process.” But the billionaires don’t want a bridge-builder. They want a compliant rubber stamp, and that’s what they’ve found in Nick Melvoin, the advocate for a “hostile takeover.” Zimmer is endorsed by many LAUSD parents and community activists as well as Mayor Eric Garcetti, Senator Bernie Sanders, Congressmembers Karen Bass, Judy Chu and Maxine Waters, City Attorney Mike Feuer and the Councilmembers serving the neighborhoods in his 4th School Board District. At the state level, State Superintendent Tom Torlakson, Secretary of State Alex Padilla, State Controller Betty Yee, Senate President Pro Tem Kevin De Leon, and Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon have all endorsed Zimmer. At the County level, he’s backed by Supervisors Hilda Solis and Sheila Kuehl along with former Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky. In his endorsement of Zimmer, Mayor Garcetti said: “The campaign against Steve has turned vicious, and I feel compelled to reach out on behalf of a champion for all our kids. I’ve worked closely with Steve Zimmer for more than 15 years. I’ve watched him make change in the lives of kids and in the fabric of our communities. Under Steve’s leadership, Los Angeles Unified schools have shown impressive progress. Steve’s collaborative, ‘all kids, all families’ approach is what we need on the School Board.”  The Los Angeles Unified School District is the second largest school system in the country with over 700,000 students. So gaining control of its board — and its budget — is a good “investment” for the billionaires who want to reshape education in this country. Melvoin’s campaign and backers have outspent Zimmer by a huge margin. Their battle has turned into a remarkable David vs. Goliath contest. But let’s recall who won that Biblical battle. Goliath had the big weapons but the feisty David had the slingshot. That’s how Zimmer beat another hand-picked billionaire-backed candidate four years ago, with a grassroots campaign that relied on parents, teachers, and neighborhood residents, and he’s hoping to do it again next Tuesday.   Peter Dreier is professor of politics and chair of the Urban & Environmental Policy Department at Occidental College.

They no longer include a criminal history check box on their employment applications. In order to chose from the best and the brightest pool of applicants, they have decided judge applicants on their merits, not their mistakes. Commonly referred to as "ban the box," this shift in employment hiring practices is about providing individuals with a fair chance at a fresh start, making our communities safer, and our economies stronger. It's time for Alabama's state and local government employers to follow the lead of these major U.S. businesses. This session our legislators have the opportunity to do just that. SB 200, sponsored by Senator Quinton Ross, would prohibit a state or local government employer from asking an applicant about their criminal history until a conditional offer of employment is made. A safeguard in the bill would enable the government employer to withdraw the job offer if the applicant's criminal conviction is directly related to the job. Further, the bill establishes clear criteria for state agencies to consider during the screening process, which would better protect the agencies from claims of discrimination under Title VII. It's a win-win. If Alabama wants to hire the best qualified applicants and make our communities safer, banning the box is a step in the right direction. Today, nearly one out of every three U.S. adults has a criminal record - that's around 70 million people. To reduce the likelihood that these individuals will reoffend, the U.S. Department of Justice has identified three key factors to successful reentry, one of which is helping people find and keep a job. Despite this knowledge, state and local government employers in Alabama continue to erect counterproductive hurdles in front of individuals seeking to rebuild their lives and provide for their families. How? For those who apply, their applications can be tossed out before they ever have an opportunity to present their qualifications or rehabilitation. For others, the criminal history box discourages them from applying in the first place, even if they are otherwise qualified for the position. Banning the Box also makes economic sense. As the National Employment Law Project notes, when an individual with a criminal record has a job, they will contribute more to the tax base, purchase more goods, and are less likely to commit a new crime, thus reducing the amount of money that state and local governments must spend on their criminal justice systems. It is estimated that our nation's economy loses $78 to $87 billion each year because of lost output caused by criminal record related barriers. As Koch Industries General Counsel Mark Holden wrote last year, banning the box is also about making businesses more competitive. "For employers seeking the best talent, it makes sense for a company to consider all factors, including any prior criminal record, in the context of an applicant's other life experiences. We are in a global competition for the best talent period; not the best talent with or without a record." Our state and local government employers should view their hiring practices in the same light. We must also look at this issue in the context of race. Because African Americans are disproportionately caught up in our criminal justice system, they are disproportionately harmed by the criminal history box. For example, even though African Americans and whites use marijuana at roughly the same rate, African Americans are more than four times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession in Alabama. Banning the box on government employment applications would offer a small opportunity to begin to address the long-term consequences of a criminal justice system that continues to disproportionately harm African Americans. Finally, this bill can help protect state employers from claims of discrimination. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) issued a guidance document for entities covered by Title VII, including state and local governments, to help eliminate unlawful discrimination in the employment hiring process. As outlined in the guidance document, an employer must show that the selection criteria use or selection procedures are "job related and consistent with business necessity." Specifically related to an applicant's criminal record, the guidance says that the individualized screening process should consider "at least the nature of the crime, the time elapsed, and the nature of the job" or otherwise comply with the EEOC Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. This bill will provide criteria to better ensure that government employers comply with Title VII. It's time for Alabama to ban the box on government employment applications. It will enhance public safety, increase our talent pool, help our economy, protect government employers, and give many Alabamians a second chance. Columnists John Archibald Kyle Whitmire Roy S.

Updated: May 13, 2017 @ 12:54 am Full Forecast top right promo - flex2 Home News Heard on the Street Heard on the Street: Collectors launch NerdinOut comic, toys shop Jeff Kiger, jkiger@postbulletin.com Jeff Kiger Business Reporter May 12, 2017 Updated 16 hrs ago (…) Brad Vigesaa and Jake Scharpen are launching what they hope will be a welcoming "Walmart" for the Med City's "nerds." The pair of longtime collectors are opening an 1,100-square-foot store called NerdinOut, which will carry a wide array for new and vintage comics, collectible card games, toys, video games and Legos. "We're two collectors who decided to give something back," said Vigesaa, who also works in sales at the Clements Subaru car dealership. They hope to open on June 1 at 322 Elton Hills Dr. NW in the Valhalla Plaza in the spaces previously occupied by Love That Dress and Pockets & Pins. Vigesaa says customers should expect an "upscale, modern" store that's well-organized and brightly lighted. A mannequin wearing a Kylo Ren costume standing next to a Red Bull cooler will welcome people into the store. "We want to create a sort of 'Disney World' experience," he said. "We want people to want to spend time here." The plan is to carry a selection of new monthly comics, along with cards for games such as "Magic: The Gathering." There will be gaming tables for players to use those cards. Plus NerdinOut will have new and used video games with a vintage and a current game console for customers to try them out or to compete in store-sponsored tournaments. NerdinOut started online a couple years ago selling collectibles through Facebook and eBay. Vigesaa said he and Scharpen also are putting their own treasures collected through the years on the shelves. That will include old Star Wars and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle figures, "retired" Lego sets, classic comics and more. The owners will staff the store with Scharpen handling the day-to-day duties as store manager. Hear something? Share it with Heard on the Street.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 12 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman How to boost coverage of your PR event—even after it’s over It’s a splendid thing to snag TV, magazine or newspaper coverage for a one-day event. Bonus points, however, go to those who tell stories that have legs, drawing further articles and social media sharing long after the event is over. A free, downloadable tip sheet from Ragan Communications and Guinness World Records, „How to land blockbuster coverage during and after a PR event,” offers pointers for using storytelling to boost coverage. The tip sheet offers creative ideas from pros for turning a one-off event into a PR gift that keeps on giving. It cites experts from Reebok, John Deere, Walmart, Mall of America and Denver Water. “It’s not just us forcing Reebok stories down people’s throats,” says Ben Blakesley, Reebok’s director of global social media. “It’s, ‘How can we identify stories that people care about and what they’re talking about?’” The tip sheet tells how Reebok promoted its CrossFit Nano 7 shoe, drawing coverage from publications such as Men’s Fitness when 33 athletes around the globe broke 44 Guinness World Records titles. The download points the way to telling stories that inspire—and explains why certain stories gain major traction in the press. The tip sheet explains why John Deere, the heavy-equipment maker, chose to publish a magazine story not about its tractors, but about the origins of country music. “Farming is just what they do for a living, but they certainly have other interests that may or may not have anything to do with agriculture,” says David G. Jones, editor of The Furrow and Homestead magazines. Learn how Walmart kept pushing the story of its commitment to buy $250 billion worth of products that support U.S. manufacturing over 10 years, using its magazine, Walmart Today, to highlight interesting smaller stories that illustrate the initiative. Find out how Mall of America partners with charities in its events, creating stories that news media outlets are willing to promote. For example, a Free Bikes 4 Kidz charitable event gathered 5,512 donated two-wheelers in 2016, earning headlines such as this one from Bicycling: “This Charity Just Broke the World Record for Most Bikes Donated.” Learn how to capture content and how you can develop your own news outlet, telling your own stories, as Denver Water did. When the event’s over, keep using the content you captured, whether you’re blogging or posting on social media. Two weeks after its event, Reebok published a story about a one-armed athlete who had broken several records. “Spread the content out over the following couple of months,” Blakesley says, “so that you can extend the length of the story.” Download your free guide here.

Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon to answer questions in a shareholders lawsuit accusing the retailer of defrauding investors by covering up a Mexican bribery scheme. U.S. District Judge Susan Hickey denied Wal-Mart's motion Thursday seeking a protective order prohibiting the CEO's deposition in the class-action case. Hickey wrote that "McMillon has unique knowledge of relevant issues in this litigation that only he can explain." McMillon -- CEO since February 2014 -- previously headed Wal-Mart's international business, and he participated in meetings, sent or received communications and signed certifications related to the alleged bribery. The City of Pontiac General Employees' Retirement System sued Wal-Mart and former CEO Mike Duke, accusing the retailer of paying bribes to Mexican officials to obtain building permits. Investors say Wal-Mart knew about the bribes in 2005 but hid knowledge for nearly seven years until learning that a newspaper was investigating the matter. Wal-Mart has investigated the allegations since 2011, which has since grown to include dealings in Brazil, China and India. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice also are looking into the allegation. -- Robbie Neiswanger In state, jobless rate lowest in northwest Northwest Arkansas had the lowest unemployment rate in the state in March at 2.5 percent, which tied for seventh among 388 metropolitan areas in the country, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics said.

Wal-Mart this week said it simplified the financing terms relating to promotional periods. In the past special financing such as 0% for 90 days or six months meant interest accrued during that time. As long as customers paid off the balance during the promotional time they paid no interest. But if it took them longer, they were hit with the interest that had been accruing through the promotional period. “The reality is most people’s lives are anything but predictable, and paying off a purchase within a set period of time doesn’t always happen as planned. We have responsibilities that weigh on us – tasks and relationships to juggle and, of course, a never-ending stack of bills to pay,” said Daniel Eckert, senior VP of services for Walmart U.S. Eckert blogged this week that Wal-Mart saw an opportunity to help customers by simplifying the special financing offer on the Walmart Credit Card and the Walmart Mastercard Credit Card. “With the new offer, you can now take advantage of no-interest financing for purchases, meaning that absolutely no interest accrues during the six- or 12-month promotional period. It’s really that simple and straightforward,” he said. Wal-Mart explained the special offer on Walmart’s store card and Mastercard includes six months zero interest for purchases made in store between $150 and $298.99. For purchases of $299 or more the zero interest period is 12 months. The Walmart store card is a good deal for consumers with fair credit, said Beverly Harzog, consumer credit expert and best-selling author of The Debt Escape Plan. She said the 23.4% annual percentage rate on the card indicates the target audience is shoppers with less-than-stellar credit. Harzog said consumers need to read the fine print when they shop for credit cards. The other perks offered with the Walmart card is 2% savings on fuel purchases at its gas stations as well as Murphy USA. There is also a 3% savings on items purchased at Walmart.com and 1% savings on items bought at Walmart. Through June 14 Wal-Mart said it will give a 20% savings up to $50 on the first item purchased by new cardholders. The maximum late fee is $37 and there is a 23-day grace period. WalletHub gives the Walmart store card a 3 star rating out of 5. The Walmart Mastercard has an APR between 17.4% and 23.4% with the same perks and fees as the Walmart store card. The Mastercard is rated 3.5 stars by WalletHub. Amazon recently unveiled its rewards signature card which give 3% cash back on items purchased at Amazon. It also gives 2% on restaurant purchases and at drug stores. Harzog said for consumers with fair credit the QuicksilverOne card by Capital One offers 1% cashback on every purchase with an APR of 24.99%. The key for anyone with a high interest card is to pay off the balance each month. “Unless consumers can payoff the balance each month, they do need to use a credit card. At the high 24% APR the compound rates can be a recipe for debt,” she added. Harzog said the Chase Freedom card gives 5% cash back up to $1,500 per quarter is one of the best cards for those with good credit. She said this card along with Discover It, rotate the places where the 5% cash back is optimized each quarter and often include ways for consumers to use to cards to pay for everyday expenses such as local transit costs. Harzog said consumers should avoid taking cash advances on the cards where they are allowed. She said the interest starts accruing instantly on the full amount of the cash taken with no grace period and regardless of 0% promotional periods.

US District Judge Susan Hickey in Fayetteville, Arkansas, said McMillon's “direct and personal involvement” in matters underlying a class-action lawsuit justified requiring him to sit for a deposition by the shareholders' lawyers. McMillon had been president of Wal-Mart International during a period when shareholders led by a Michigan pension fund said the retailer concealed suspected bribery by its Wal-Mart de Mexico unit to government officials, to speed up store openings. The Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer had argued that McMillon lacked the “unique or special knowledge” to justify burdening him with a deposition. But the judge said McMillon, who became chief executive in February 2014, took part in several meetings, saw dozens of communications, and had certified many public statements by Wal-Mart about the alleged bribery. “It appears to the court that McMillon has unique knowledge of relevant issues in this litigation that only he can explain,” Hickey wrote. A deposition could last four hours, she added. Wal-Mart had no immediate comment. Jason Forge, a lawyer for the lead plaintiff City of Pontiac General Employees' Retirement System, said in an email: “We're determined to try this case in court.” Wal-Mart's market value slid US$17 billion (RM73.8 billion) over three days in April 2012 after the New York Times reported the alleged bribery and said it had been first discovered internally in 2005. Shareholders accused Wal-Mart and Mike Duke, who preceded McMillon as chief executive, of downplaying the scheme even after learning about the Times' investigation. The class period runs from Dec 8, 2011 to April 20, 2012. Earlier this week, Bloomberg News said Wal-Mart may pay about US$300 million to settle a US government probe into suspected bribery in Mexico, India and China, citing people familiar with the matter. A US$300 million payment would represent about one week of profit for Wal-Mart. — Reuters                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Malindo Air to take Batik Air name Bursa to trend higher next week on crude oil, CPO price recovery Ringgit to see range-bound trading with upside bias next week Money market to remain stable next week Europe, emerging markets boost stocks; US assets fall on data Fitch unit predicts ECRL, upgraded Kuantan port to boost East Coast economy High debt, stagnant wages to hobble Malaysia’s growth in 2017, says economist Zcash, the virtual money making its mark IJM Perennial unveils its RM4.5b Penang waterfront development Najib urges oil and gas companies to promote use of natural gas Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: Rock supergroup Dreamcar discusses creation, No Doubt reunion Reuters Video: Oscars chief Boone Isaacs steps down from governors board Innovative globe chess board Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake Reuters Video: Thai man murders baby, commits suicide on Facebook Live Tilda Swinton unveils strange ‘Okja’ promo clip Related Articles Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

LaPlante is accused of substituting flour for infant formula in containers returned to several local stores for refunds, and police have warned the public to check formula containers' seals for tampering. Tucson Police Department via AP) Nation & World May 13, 2017 12:57 AM Arizona police: Woman switched flour for formula The Associated Press LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story TUCSON, Ariz. A Tucson woman is accused of substituting flour for infant formula in containers returned to several local stores for refunds, and police have warned the public to check formula containers' seals for tampering. One child got sick from ingesting tampered formula but is in good condition after being treated at a hospital and released May 5, police said late Thursday. Police Chief Chris Magnus held an unusual nighttime news conference to disclose the arrest and to warn the public. "We're concerned about this and wanted to get the information out as quickly as possible to avoid any other children from becoming sick," Magnus said. Police said the suspect was motivated by money and apparently took place over at least several days and possibly for up to two months. The formula was either purchased or stolen, police said. Dr. Francisco Garcia, chief medical officer for Pima County, said tests are being conducted to determine whether other substances were put in formula containers along with flour, such as something to make it more palatable. Police said Jennifer LaPlante, 30, was arrested Thursday on suspicion of fraudulent schemes and artifices and child endangerment. LaPlante remained jailed Friday. It wasn't immediately known whether she has an attorney who could comment on the allegations. Police listed two Fry's grocery stores and two Wal-Mart stores, all on Tucson's eastside, that are linked to the incident. Officials at Arkansas-based Wal-Mart said they don't restock baby formula and are "deeply disturbed" by the Tucson incident. "Our customers deserve safe, quality foods, and we have policies in place to help ensure that returned baby formula is not put back on our shelves," Wal-Mart spokesman Ragan Dickens said in a statement. A police department spokesman, Sgt. Pete Dugan, said Friday he wasn't aware of additional reports of tampered formula. However, detectives remained "smack-dab in the middle of the investigation," Dugan said. "They need to find out if there's others involved. They need to find out if there's other stores involved." Officials advised recent purchasers of infant formula from Tucson businesses to check seals on containers and to see whether the formula smelled normal. Parents shouldn't feed infants with any formula if there's any question of possible tampering, Garcia said. "Those seals should be intact," he said.

  You are here: Home > Opinion > Columnists A piece of the economic pie By Earl Bousquet 0 Comment(s)Print E-mail China.org.cn, May 13, 2017 Adjust font size: Everyone wants a piece of China today. The British, Canadians and Americans – like many others – are indeed going head over heels to attract more Chinese investment, students and visitors. With China producing an ever-increasing amount of millionaires, businesses and wealthy citizens are increasingly being wooed to leave China and take up residence abroad. On May 7, top U.S. and U.K. newspapers reported that a U.S. businesswoman with ties to the White House was in Beijing unfairly wooing Chinese investors to invest in a private luxury development, with the prospect of receiving U.S. green cards in return. The issue was also used to raise conflict of interest issues with the Trump administration. But offering permanent residency and passports in return for investment is standard practice in most Western capitals. Despite fears about abuse of such schemes by unsavory characters, many countries worldwide – including the U.S. – actually officially offer citizenship for investors. It's the same in smaller nations, too, including the Caribbean countries, where some Citizenship by Investment Programs (CIP) invite potential investors to "Come as a Visitor and Leave as a Citizen." But China does not have to offer or sell passports for investment, as facilities already exist for persons needing to remain there for usually long periods. American and European investors already flock to China, as a result of growing business opportunities and guarantees of attractive rates-of-return: Airbus delivered 153 aircraft to China in 2016, Walmart recently opened-up 40 new outlets in China, Changan Ford opened a fifth China factory last year and Shanghai Disney recorded welcoming nearly 6 million visitors in just seven months in 2016 – and last year McDonald's sold its China business for over $2 billion. U.S. companies also reap great profits from the Chinese market. In 2015, China purchased $165 billion in goods and services from the USA alone, representing 7.3 percent of all U.S. exports; and by 2030, estimates are that U.S. exports to China will rise to over $520 billion. With the World Bank predicting the Chinese economy to grow by 6.5 percent in 2017 and the population to reach an estimated 1.45 billion by 2030, American and European companies are also keeping their eyes on China. Chinese companies have also invested billions in the U.S., creating much-needed jobs. According to a January 2017 report by the U.S.-China Business Council, trade with China supports some 2.6 million jobs in the U.S. Chinese firms have also been landing lucrative transport, construction, engineering and energy contracts in the U.S., with some well poised to land investment possibilities in joint public-private ventures to come out of Donald Trump's recent unveiling of a massive trillion-dollar infrastructure plan. Likewise in the U.K and Europe, sizeable Chinese investments in real estate, joint and/or public-private partnerships are also growing by leaps and bounds. Indeed, records show that China has contributed more towards global growth over the past 15 years than the Eurozone and the U.S. combined – while also accounting for one-third of global GDP growth in 2015. Naturally an investment powerhouse, China has learned from the experiences of others and therefore continues to be accused of being too careful, and even too restrictive about the places in and levels at which foreign direct investment can be applied domestically. Major Western nations continue to accuse China of everything from cyber trade espionage to copyright infringement and currency manipulation. But their major corporations continue to seek and find ways and means of doing more business with China. The fact is: Foreign companies hardly have to be enticed to do business with China today. Nor do Chinese companies have to be surreptitiously enticed to pack-up and leave for other shores. Chinese firms already have their own big plans for overseas investment. Moreover, China has for long been opening-up to foreign investment. The upcoming Belt & Road Forum for International Cooperation in China on May 14-15 will provide another opportunity for states, corporations and other entities that haven't made up their minds to take advantage of the many opportunities offered by China's economic growth. Naturally, some Chinese businesses, nearer to the starting point of the new route, have readily taken the initiative to realize the ancient proverb of "The early bird catches the worm." But others along the way – and from near and far – can also board the early train for the free ride on the new road for equal investment challenges and fruitful rate-of-return opportunities.

Welcome to this week in home video! And by “this week” I mean “last week” as we were offline last week. Click the title to buy a Blu-ray/DVD from Amazon and help support FSR in the process! Pick of the Week The Autopsy of Jane Doe [Scream Factory] What is it? A father/son mortician team see their latest job descend them into a nightmare. Why buy it? One of last year’s best horror films comes home, and genre fans shouldn’t hesitate in picking it up for the first of many watches. Brian Cox and Emile Hirsch are terrific as the pair who see their family business take a hit when the corpse on their slab begins revealing a terrible litany of secrets. Director Andre Ovredal builds immense atmosphere with only a few characters and a single location, and the scares become merciless in their frequency and intensity. It’s a rare horror film where we care about the characters, and that attachment leads to increased tension and fear. Turn out the lights, turn up the volume, and settle in for a modern gem. *Note: This is a Wal-Mart exclusive release until late June when it becomes available everywhere including Amazon.* [Blu-ray/DVD extras: None] The Best 3:10 to Yuma What is it? A father with a bum leg takes heroic action in order to feed his family and impress his son. Why buy it? James Mangold delivered one of the year’s best westerns with his Wolverine film Logan, but his previous entry into the genre is almost as good. 3:10 to Yuma is a remake that finds its own voice in the changes made and the casting of Christian Bale and Russell Crowe in the lead roles. It’s a beautifully shot journey of perceived heroism and hopeful redemption, and it stands tall as a great western. This new release ports over previous extras while bringing the film into the present with a sharp and pristine 4K transfer. It’s worth the upgrade for 4K users but also worth a blind buy for everyone else. [4K UltraHD/Blu-ray extras: Commentary by James Mangold, featurettes, making of, deleted scenes] ———- The Age of Shadows What is it? Korean rebels resist against their Japanese occupiers with intrigue, deception, and lots of violence. Why buy it? This is gorgeous, dense, and thrilling spycraft set in 1920’s Korea and features story turns and meaty characters that share the screen with heavy drama and cracking action sequences. It’s borderline convoluted depending on how closely you manage to pay attention to the character and story details, but even if temporarily lose track of what’s happening you’re never left hanging thanks to its endlessly appealing cinematography. Kim Jee-woon (The Good the Bad the Weird) is still a kinetic mastermind too meaning the action sequences are typically stunners. [Blu-ray/DVD extras: Interviews] ———- I Am Not Your Negro What is it? An unfinished book becomes a documentary about an ongoing reality. Why buy it? James Baldwin’s unfinished book, Remember This House, finds new life in this new documentary that’s at times poetic and searing in its exploration and examination of race in modern day America. Baldwin’s text is given a voice – through both his own and Samuel L. Jackson’s – and set against archival footage which collectively tells the story of a country that still can’t get its shit together. This is the kind of doc that should be mandatory viewing for students as it presents a visceral reality that people too often ignore and avoid. Buy it, watch it, share it. [Blu-ray/DVD extras: Interview, Q&As, photo gallery] ———- Real Genius What is it? A young genius faces the pressures of older kids, tough professors, military secrets, first love, and a mildly odd roommate. Why buy it? Martha Coolidge’s mid ’80s classic remains one of the decade’s best comedies thanks equally to a ridiculously sharp and funny script and the presence of Val Kilmer at the absolute top of his game. His one-two punch of this and Top Secret! showcase a comedic talent that he wouldn’t truly revisit until the pure brilliance of Kiss Kiss Bang Bang two decades later, but all three represent comedy perfection. Coolidge’s film is filled with memorable moments and lines making it a highly quotable joy. Its Blu-ray debut only has a single feature, but it’s a brand new commentary from the director making this a must-own for fans. [Blu-ray/DVD extras: Commentary with Martha Coolidge] ———- Seven Days in May [Warner Archive] What is it? Who ordered the military coup in the United States of America? Why see it? John Frankenheimer’s mid ’60s thriller posits a scenario that’s probably a bit closer to reality than we’d like to believe, and he brings a strong cast along for the ride including Kirk Douglas and Burt Lancaster. Rod Serling’s script moves between Lancaster’s rogue general and the president’s secretive efforts to discover the truth of the impending coup, and moments of action are peppered into the suspense and drama. A subplot involving Ava Gardner feels slightly out of place and slows things down at times, but the main story builds with a steadily increasing momentum. [Blu-ray/DVD extras: Commentary by John Frankenheimer] ———- Tunnel What is it? A man struggles to survive after being trapped in a tunnel cave-in. Why buy it? Disaster movies typically have familiar beats as the protagonists clash in their efforts to survive, but this Korean film avoids that pitfall by stranding a single person amid the disaster. It moves between his situation and the world outside, one where common decency, politics, and reality compete to affect the rescue effort. The result is a thrilling mix of suspense, humor, and drama every bit as compelling as a bigger, grander disaster picture. It’s from the director of A Hard Day too, so you definitely want to give it a watch. [DVD extras: None] The Rest Axe Giant: The Wrath of Paul Bunyan What is it? You won’t like Paul Bunyan when he’s angry. Why see it? I haven’t actually seen this one yet, but check out this trailer. I’m not saying it looks good necessarily, but I legit love the premise that offers up both a Paul Bunyan origin story and a modern day horror tale. Cheesy, silly, goofy, and overloaded with questionable CG effects, it’s bound to in no way live up to the trailer’s joys, but dammit I’m still going to watch it. [DVD extras: None?] Beyond the Gates [Scream Factory] What is it? A VCR game draws two brothers into a deadly world of supernatural shenanigans. Why see it? The film mixes a nostalgia for those ’80s VCR games – honestly cool at the time for those of you too young to remember – with a gory Jumanji and then throws in a wicked Barbara Crampton for good measure. It’s a low-key film, particularly in its first half, but things get enjoyably nutty as it moves towards a conclusion. The budget definitely keeps things tamped down a bit, but the charm is unmistakable. [Blu-ray/DVD extras: Commentaries, featurette, deleted scenes] The Comedian What is it? A bitter, over the hill comedian finds his humanity while doing community service. Why see it? Robert De Niro has been supplementing his filmography with direct-to-DVD movies for a few years now, and while this comedy technically had a short, limited run it’s still a lesser experience for viewers. There’s never been a movie about a stand-up comedian in which the stand-up was actually funny, and this is no different. Worse though the film’s never all that entertaining off-stage either. De Niro’s on auto-pilot, and his arc is a predictable one. The only bright spot here, and the only reason to watch it really, is the presence of Leslie Mann. It’s not a great role necessarily, but she makes the most of it. [DVD extras: Deleted scenes, featurette, Q&A] A Dog’s Purpose What is it? A dog is reincarnated several times before realizing it exists solely to make Dennis Quaid smile. Why skip it? Are dogs and puppies cute? Of course they are, and that may be reason enough for some of you to give this one a watch. For some of us though the themes and end message made implicit in the title are just garbage. It cycles though the dog’s lives with a whimsical tone highlighting how the mutts exist solely to help people, and while I get that in the lazy sense it’s pretty damn insulting at the end of the day. For dogs I mean. But hey, Josh Gad voices the dog so your kids will love it. [Blu-ray/DVD extras: Deleted scenes, outtakes, featurettes] Gold What is it? A gold prospector finds gold before discovering that’s the easy part. Why see it? Matthew McConaughey and Edgar Ramirez are always worth watching even if both actors are better than the film they’re currently a part of, and that’s definitely the case here. It has its moments, typically in early scenes with heightened emotions, energy, and geographic flair, but it never quite manages to engage. McConaughey cares and he gives it his all, but we’re left unaffected by both his ambition and his eventual excess. The Wolf of Wall Street this is not. [Blu-ray/DVD extras: Deleted scene, commentary by Stephen Gaghan, featurettes] Hunting Grounds What is it? Four hunters are themselves hunted when they find themselves targeted by angry Bigfoots… or is it Bigfeets? Why skip it? The Bigfoot horror sub-genre is a favorite of mine, but for every Abominable or Night of the Demon there are a dozen far lesser films. This one leans towards the lesser unfortunately despite a somewhat intriguing Bigfoot situation because the script and characters are endlessly obnoxious. The creatures themselves are fine, but the atmosphere, scares, and action are all neutered by characters who have us wishing for their demise early on. [DVD extras: None?] Mindgamers What is it? Downloadable skill-sets become more of a curse than a blessing. Why see it? Anyone familiar with The Matrix will get the main plot point here as a group of young scientists develop a method of transferring skills and knowledge from person to database to brand new person. Don’t have time to learn parkour? Download it, and now you’re an expert! The bulk of the film is a traditional thriller with espionage and illicit interests, and it’s forgettable but passable entertainment. Sam Neill is the big draw here in a small role. [Blu-ray/DVD extras: Making of] The Resurrection of Gavin Stone What is it? A Hollywood bad boy is redeemed through community service at his hometown church. Why skip it? This is by all accounts a nice, simple movie, but in its effort to tell a positive story it manages only to be wholly predictable, obvious, and dull. Brett Dalton (Marvel’s Agents of SHIELD) is fine, but dull, as a man who follows the exact arc we expect with absolutely zero opportunity for anything fresh or unexpected. The film caters directly to audiences who can’t handle the slightest offense or challenge to their views and beliefs, but if you’re not in that camp then it’s not worth your time. It’s great seeing D.B. Sweeney again I guess, but he’s hardly enough to recommend a watch. [Blu-ray/DVD extras: Deleted scenes, featurette, interviews] Rings What is it? A college professor enlists students to help unravel the mystery of the long-haired girl with a phone card. Why skip it? Gore Verbinski’s 2002 remake is a rare reboot that surpasses the original, and it remains one of the best horror films of the millennium. The sequel was a far lesser creation, and now this long-gestating third film sinks the franchise even further. The story presents some new revelations that just fall flat, and the scares are even weaker in their execution. The leads are no help as they lack much in the way of chemistry or charisma, and while Vincent D’Onofrio brings some of his grizzled charm in a supporting role it’s not nearly enough to justify a watch. [Blu-ray/DVD extras: Deleted scenes, featurettes] The Salesman What is it? A struggling couple move into a new apartment only to find themselves dealing with the previous tenant’s legacy. Why see it? Asghar Farhadi (About Elly, A Separation) makes films that take events both normal and genre-oriented and turns the focus towards the human participants at the center of it all. His latest leans towards the latter as an attack on his wife leaves a husband set on revenge, but it’s more the shell of a thriller than a thriller itself. That’s by intent as Farhadi’s goal is to highlight both the couple and their community in their collective inability to communicate and deal with the situation. The thriller aspects are ultimately left wanting, but the drama and character work still make for a compelling film. [Blu-ray/DVD extras: Interview] Saturday Night Fever — Director’s Cut What is it? Tony Manero is a restless punk by day and a legend on the disco dance floor by night. Why see it? Pulp Fiction is the better film and the one that rejuvenated John Travolta’s film career, but this late ’70s disco drama is the one that first started it. “Disco drama” is a good way to explain it as the film is easily divided into two halves – Manero’s daily life sees him maneuvering the ups and downs of family life and his circle of friends – and the two halves aren’t equally memorable. The dramatic beats are forgettable compared to the dance floor shenanigans which inject the movie with immense vitality. It’s here where we see why the movie catapulted Travolta to stardom.

RUGABER AP Economics Writer WASHINGTON (AP) - Americans stepped up their spending at auto dealers, hardware stores and e-commerce outlets as retail sales rebounded from two sluggish months. The Commerce Department said Friday that retail sales increased 0.4 percent in April from March. Sales ticked up just 0.1 percent in March and fell in February. The increase suggests that consumers are poised to spur faster growth in the April-June quarter after the economy barely expanded in the first three months of the year. Consumer spending - which also includes spending on services such as utilities - rose at its slowest pace in more than seven years in the first quarter. The rise also indicates that the struggles of large retail chains, such as Macy's and JC Penney's, reflect changes in consumer buying patterns more than broader economic weakness. Sales in a category that includes department stores, as well as general retailers such as Wal-Mart, fell 0.5 percent in April, the government said. Yet a category that includes online retailers reported sales growth of 1.4 percent, the strongest of any group. "The retail sales data provide further reason to expect that overall consumption growth will be much stronger in the second quarter," said Andrew Hunter, U.S. economist at Capital Economics. The sales gains were widespread, as Americans spent more at electronics and appliance stores, health care retailers, and sporting goods outlets. Sales fell at grocery stores and clothing merchants. Americans ate out more, boosting spending at restaurants and bars 0.4 percent. Auto sales rose 0.7 percent after falling in March. Consumer confidence has soared since the presidential election, but spending hasn't increased as much as the jump in optimism would suggest. Last month's gain in retail sales was solid but not particularly strong. Hiring has been steady and the unemployment rate fell to a ten-year low of 4.4 percent in April. Yet average hourly pay rose just 2.5 percent over the past year. And inflation has ticked up, eroding most of that wage gain. In a separate report, the Labor Department said consumer prices increased 2.2 percent in the past year. The slowdown in consumer spending over the winter added to the woes of many retailers. On Wednesday Macy's reported sharply lower sales and profits, causing a collapse in its share price. Brick-and-mortar retailers are suffering through their worst patch since the Great Recession. More than twice as many stores have closed this year than at the same point last year. Bankruptcies are far outpacing last year's rate. Retailers slashed jobs at the sharpest pace in seven years this spring. And retailers collectively could report the biggest drop in first-quarter profits since 2009. ___ This story has been corrected to show that a category including department stores reported a 0.5 percent drop in sales. Sales at department stores rose 0.2 percent, rather than falling 0.2 percent. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Kaufman Lianna Lefler had been missing since April 29. On Saturday, April 29th, 2017 at approximately 1:30 P.M. Lianna Lefler (18 years old) was reported to the Prescott Valley Police Department by co-workers at Walmart in Prescott Valley to be missing. Based on the report, Prescott Valley Police Officers and Police Detectives began to search for Lianna Lefler by various means possible and have been looking for Lefler since April 29th, 2017.  To assist with the search for Lefler, the Prescott Valley Police Department called upon the assistance of the Yavapai County Sheriff’s Office and the Yavapai County Sheriff’s Office Search and Rescue to assist.  Over the course of the last two weeks various law enforcement entities, family members and citizens of the community have searched various areas of the Prescott and Prescott Valley areas with negative findings. On Friday, May 12th, 2017 at approximately 12:00 P.M., Lianna Lefler was located and determined to be deceased by personnel who were surveying the area for the new connector road on top of Glassford Hill.   Based on the finding, law enforcement personnel and Central Arizona Fire and Medical Authority personnel from the Prescott Valley area responded to the location in question and corroborated the finding. The location of Lefler’s finding was off of a maintenance road close to the top of Glassford Hill Mountain. Lianna Lefler's next of kin have been notified. This case is still under investigation and additional information will be provided when available.  Tweet Related items Missing Yarnell Woman's Body Found in Hills Near Yarnell Fain Signature Group Turning Trash into Jobs to Support Veterans, The Homeless and Disabled Adults Body Found on Constellation Trail Join the 10,000+ others and subscribe to the newsletter.

Like other flows, data flows can demonstrate imbalances among exports and imports. Some of these flows represent ‘raw’ data while others represent high-value-added data products. Does any of this make a difference in national economic development trajectories? This paper argues that the answer is yes” [Cambridge University Press]. Politics 2016 Post Mortem “Clinton’s Defeat: Outside Factors Hurt, but Blame Falls on the Candidate” [Charles Cook, The Cook Report]. Two quotes, since Cook is about as close to a dean of political reporting as we have these days, David Broder [genuflects] having passed away: But those [DNC and Podesta email] leaks and Comey’s pro­nounce­ments would not have made a dif­fer­ence had Clin­ton run a bet­ter cam­paign. In­stead of try­ing to win over mal­le­able voters, her team tried to re-cre­ate the Obama co­ali­tion of minor­it­ies, mil­len­ni­als, lib­er­als, and urb­an voters—nev­er mind that the can­did­ate was a 69-year-old white wo­man who had been in the pub­lic eye for 25 years, not a young, cha­ris­mat­ic, fresh face seek­ing to be­come the first Afric­an-Amer­ic­an pres­id­ent. And: But you have to give cred­it to Trump and his cam­paign. He tapped in­to fear, an­ger, and re­sent­ments that polit­ic­al pros had either ig­nored or dis­missed. He settled down and be­came as fo­cused as he is cap­able of be­ing in the fi­nal two weeks, when it really mattered. And his cam­paign blew through cracks in the vaunted blue wall of states that Demo­crats thought was im­pen­et­rable. The 2016 pres­id­en­tial elec­tion had a lot of mov­ing parts, a lot of vari­ables that alone might not have af­fected the out­come but col­lect­ively cer­tainly did. No one or two things ex­plain a race that be­low the radar was closer than na­tion­al polls in­dic­ated—and that on Elec­tion Day el­ev­ated to the pres­id­ency a polit­ic­al novice whose strength among or­din­ary voters was masked by the loath­ing of the elites. Worth a read, if only for the refreshing lack of hysteria. I know this is only one example, but: before anyone spews any more shit about the korean people being &quot;&quot;mindlessly devoted&quot;&quot; to their &quot;&quot;glorious leader&quot;&quot; pic.twitter.com/sgXJIO8qp0 &mdash; Great Tweets!

Yep. “‘Berniecrats’ roil state Democratic Party leadership fight” [Capitol Weekly]. “At stake is the party chairmanship held by the departing John Burton, a liberal icon, a longtime lawmaker and former Senate leader who became chair in 2009…. “We’re hoping to get Kimberly Ellis elected, that’s probably the primary goal, but the other is to get Bernie people involved in local government,” said Alexis Edelstein, founder and CEO of the 300-member Berniecrats of California. They surprised insiders by dominating the obscure process — electing a third of the delegates for the state convention, scheduled for May 19-21 in Sacramento. They believe they have turned the once-sleepy race for a new party chair into a serious contest with Bauman, long viewed as the front-runner.” “No One Expected Obama Would Deport More People Than any Other U.S. President” [WNYC]. “Advocate: Trump’s Deportations are Possible Because Obama & Congress Failed to Protect Immigrants” [Democracy Now!] Stats Watch Yesterday and today: Producer Price Index (Final Demand), April 2017: “March was an unusually weak month for inflation and April, after yesterday’s import & export price report followed by today’s producer price report, is shaping up to prove an unusually strong month” [Econoday]. “Because of the size of the monthly swings and questions surrounding Easter, March and April will have to be taken together when assessing inflation data, as it is when assessing retail sales for the two months. Today’s report points to another set of upside surprises in tomorrow’s consumer price report.” And: Mostly the data shows Producer Price data was treading water. In general, Goods inflation surge trend has moderated whilst services inflation is now on the high end of readings seen over the last year. This month’s inflation data is worse than expectations” [Econoday]. Atlanta Fed Business Inflation Expectations, May 2017: “Price expectations, both in this report and on the consumer side, have been muted, a factor that may limit the Federal Reserve’s efforts to reinflate the economy” [Econoday].

Today’s results suggest that March’s 16-year low for the core PCE price index is likely to be quickly reversed and that Thursday’s producer prices and Friday’s consumer prices may both come in higher than expected.” Jobless Claims, week of May 6, 2017: Lower than expected [Econoday]. “Confirming the positive signal from initial claims are continuing claims,” a 29-year low.

Shipping; “The U.S. Postal Service (USPS) today posted a $474 million year-over-year decline in fiscal second-quarter operating revenue, due in large part to the April 2016 expiration of a 4.3-percent emergency surcharge that went into effect in January 2014, and a $69 million increase in so-called controllable expenses stemming from higher labor costs” [DC Velocity]. Political Risk: “Firing Comey and Trump Agenda” [Across the Curve]. I can’t find this on Google, so maybe AtC got it off the Bloomberg terminal. It’s a good round-up, and well worth a read. My favorite comment is that the situation on Capitol Hill is “almost unimaginably fluid.” The thing is, I can’t frame that the deliberate creation of “fluidity” in Machivellian terms, and it’s a safe bet that most of the players on the Hill are Machiavellian. Creating volatility is strategic if… If… You’re properly hedged? Readers? Political Risk: “Supply chain managers are being told that three of the most pressing risks to business performance in the 21st century are cyber attack, natural hazards and supply chain failure” [Logistics Managment]. “For companies concerned by the increasing incidence of cyber attack, oil-rich Saudi Arabia has emerged as a country with above-average inherent cyber risk. Its high internet penetration, combined with a limited cyber security industry, make it a more vulnerable target…. [F]ood-prone Bangladesh, a major manufacturing hub for apparel and textiles, ranks toward the bottom of the index…. For companies with global supply chains, Germany, a major exporter and importer, ranks near the top in resilience, driven in part by its strong ability to demonstrate where parts, components or products are in transit. Russia ranks below average in this respect.” War on Cash: “Mastercard, Visa and UnionPay International have introduced a standardised QR code platform for payments in Thailand that will let consumers make a transaction with their mobile device at any supporting location. The service has been designed to support the Bank of Thailand’s cashless agenda which aims to “drive innovation, interoperability and security in payments” across the country” [NFC World]. Political Risk: “Although some [Silk Road] projects such as a new China-Europe freight rail line have gotten plenty of attention, analysts say investments by China’s development banks have been modest and out of step with the soaring official rhetoric. Expected beneficiaries in the belt-and-road countries are still waiting for the gusher of Chinese infrastructure funds to open up and draw their backwater economies into global supply chains. With China’s economy stretched, however, companies there are largely sticking to safer markets. Some analysts say that’s just as well since bigger investment in belt-and-road projects could prove disastrous in other countries if the money goes to dud projects” [Wall Street Journal]. Then again– Political Risk: “Lessons for China in failed US Silk Road initiative” [South China Morning Post]. “The United States’ New Silk Road initiative [under SoS Clinton] was ‘basically a collection of interesting, somewhat promising but cash-poor ideas about regional connectivity’, said George Gavrilis, author of the 2008 book Dynamics of Interstate Boundaries, a study on border control in Central Asia since the 19th century. Beijing’s plan had ‘a lot more money behind it in the form of loans, grants, soft loans, low-conditionality and no-conditionality loans.'” And Trump has yet to appoint an Ambassador to Afghanistan, which “sits at the center” of the Silk Road. The Bezzle: “Wal-Mart Stores Inc.’s international expansion efforts are about to get much more costly. U.S. authorities are asking the company to pay $300 million to settle a five-year investigation into allegations of foreign bribery, the WSJ’s Aruna Viswanatha and Sarah Nassauer report. That possible settlement comes on top of some $840 million the retailer has already spent on an internal investigation and to upgrade its own compliance operations. The penalty would allow the company to clear away a cloud that has been hanging over its business and its global expansion in several countries, where Wal-Mart has been aggressively adding big storefront and logistics operations” [Wall Street Journal].

Our Famously Free Press “Publishers are realizing that upward of 75% of digital ad spend goes to two companies that get almost all of their content for free from those same publishers. Premium content trade association Digital Content Next (DCN) did its own calculation recently to show that without Google and Facebook in those otherwise rosy quarterly reports on digital ad growth, the real online ad economy for other publishers may be growing at a 1% rate.

News of the Wired “[In American culture] we have very high levels of self-esteem and narcissism. I think because of the big self-esteem movement, people just got it in their heads that the key to psychological health was self-esteem.

About Lambert Strether Readers, I have had a correspondent characterize my views as realistic cynical. Let me briefly explain them. I believe in universal programs that provide concrete material benefits, especially to the working class. Medicare for All is the prime example, but tuition-free college and a Post Office Bank also fall under this heading. So do a Jobs Guarantee and a Debt Jubilee. Clearly, neither liberal Democrats nor conservative Republicans can deliver on such programs, because the two are different flavors of neoliberalism (“Because markets”). I don’t much care about the “ism” that delivers the benefits, although whichever one does have to put common humanity first, as opposed to markets. Could be a second FDR saving capitalism, democratic socialism leashing and collaring it, or communism razing it. I don’t much care, as long as the benefits are delivered. To me, the key issue — and this is why Medicare for All is always first with me — is the tens of thousands of excess “deaths from despair,” as described by the Case-Deaton study, and other recent studies. That enormous body count makes Medicare for All, at the very least, a moral and strategic imperative. And that level of suffering and organic damage makes the concerns of identity politics — even the worthy fight to help the refugees Bush, Obama, and Clinton’s wars created — bright shiny objects by comparison. Hence my frustration with the news flow — currently in my view the swirling intersection of two, separate Shock Doctrine campaigns, one by the Administration, and the other by out-of-power liberals and their allies in the State and in the press — a news flow that constantly forces me to focus on matters that I regard as of secondary importance to the excess deaths. What kind of political economy is it that halts or even reverses the increases in life expectancy that civilized societies have achieved? I am also very hopeful that the continuing destruction of both party establishments will open the space for voices supporting programs similar to those I have listed; let’s call such voices “the left.” Volatility creates opportunity, especially if the Democrat establishment, which puts markets first and opposes all such programs, isn’t allowed to get back into the saddle. Eyes on the prize! I love the tactical level, and secretly love even the horse race, since I’ve been blogging about it daily for fourteen years, but everything I write has this perspective at the back of it.

You have got to watch this video, Georgia state police putting people in jail becasue they THINK they smoked weed and were driving under the influence! NBC News Atlanta: ‘The Drug Whisperer’ The conversation recorded from the dash cam of the police car: Officer Carroll: “I’m going to ask you a question, okay? When was the last time you smoked marijuana?” Katelyn Ebner: “Oh, I don’t do that. I can give you a drug test right now.” Officer Carroll: “You don’t smoke marijuana?” Katelyn Ebner: “I do not, no.” Officer Carroll: “Okay. Well, you’re showing me indicators that you have been smoking marijuana, okay?” Officer Carroll: “Watch your wrists for me, I don’t want to pinch you.” Katelyn Ebner: “I’m going to jail for marijuana?” Officer Carroll: “No, ma’am — not possession, unless I find any in your car. I believe you’re impaired by the marijuana you’ve smoked.” Katelyn Ebner: “Okay, so when I do a drug test, I’ll be free to go, correct?” Officer Carroll: “You’re going to jail, ma’am. Okay? I don’t have a magical drug test that I can give you right now.” So, what they are doing is playing the odds. They will likely find weed in the system of the majority of people that they pull over even though the amount they find is no indication of sobriety. I am trying to find the money trail but no idea how the arrests could …oh…maybe if it fills the private prisons with more bodies?

Reply ↓ lyman alpha blob May 11, 2017 at 6:04 pm This isn’t an isolated incident though and lots of cops are just dumb. Back in the early 90s an acquaintance of mine was pulled over for a similar minor traffic violation and had his van ransacked because the cops were sure he had drugs on him. They finally found a small vial filled with liquid which they felt was evidence, despite his protests that it was not drugs. They smelled it and disagreed. I believe he was arrested before they finally realized it was patchouli oil, just like he told them. Now that day may have been one of the few times he didn’t have some weed in the boogie van, but still the cops ought to be able to tell what’s an illegal drug and what isn’t before arresting someone.

The “Love It or Leave It” bumper stickers were still on bumpers when I was growing up. I chose MAD Magazine’s Al Jaffee’s snappy answer: “I only sort of like it, can I live on the Canadian border?” I’m interested in how the proponents justify it these days while the cancer is metastasizing and destroying any real “exit” to be had. And, to be honest, I like to watch people squirm while they justify their secular faith against all evidence. I can’t wait for the next would-be expat open thread. I’d love to know where, if anywhere, a jack-of-all-technologies socialist in their early 40s who speaks un poco español and has no real ticket in the dotcom lottery, could go native and enjoy a modest yet sufficient existence without devoting every waking hour to it.

Anyway, London would be sub-optimal as a destination, several million non-drivers notwithstanding. We have fewer cars here and the cops are (slightly) less tooled up, but they (the cops not the cars) make up for their hardware deficit in sheer frothing aggression. Admittedly though, the chances of ‘becoming a victim’ (i.e. of the uniformed gangstas) work sort of in reverse: riding a bus in particular tends to make you more worthy of whimsy’s nightstick than any commuter on a more expensive subway or train or a suitably upscale bicycle, let alone driving a car. Unless the car is too old that is, or you’re too young for it, especially if you’re black and male, or black and female, brown or “of Eastern appearance” and male or female, or not too old at all but incorrigibly “of” any one of those “appearances”.

Reply ↓ clinical wasteman May 11, 2017 at 5:46 pm Maybe your Lada was a Chinese counterfeit of that Prestige brand? The one my mother had 30 years ago in NZ (no I don’t know how it got there) was indestructible. Then again it was really a 1970s Fiat, built at Togliattigrad (named for the postwar Italian Communist Party leader who brokered the deal between Brezhnev and the Agnelli family): designed for production in Turin, but the Agnellis’ party was permanently* spoiled there by actual (i.e. non-Party) communists at the Mirafiori factory. (cf. Rabid G. a few days back.) *’Fiat’ (incl. Chrysler) cars are made in Sicily, Poland and Detroit today for reasons ultimately to do with the uproarious (all senses) workforce in northern Italy in the ’70s.

It angers me to no end, and I don’t just blame GA rednecks, here in “liberal” NYC, de Blasio (darling of Hillary) has his thugs at the NYPD step up MJ arrests, and its almost always Black or Brown people.

He did his best to make sure that marijuana was never legal as far as the state was concerned and when that was becoming politically impossible managed to craft and pass a medical marijuana law that makes it nearly impossible to find a doctor, qualify for the prescription, find a dispensary and then afford the highly manufactured legal version. Something tells me that it isn’t just in NYC that marijuana is targeted. Reply ↓ NotTimothyGeithner May 11, 2017 at 7:59 pm What is particularly shocking is Cuomo intends to run for President. After all, it is the party that put up Hillary Clinton. They aren’t exactly bright. I guess he intends to deny it in the future or “evolve” on the issue. He will probably blame Russia. Currently, the establishment Democratic candidate for Virginia governor believes healthcare is a privilege, voted for Shrub twice, and doesn’t want to over turn Virginia’s “right to work” laws.

I happened to do a query to find out if there were actually any cases on file in the late 1980’s. There were probably a dozen or so recent convictions. The south has been a police state for a long time. Reply ↓ RabidGandhi May 11, 2017 at 4:26 pm That video is indeed draw-dropping. Of course at the end of the spot, the reporter takes pains to justify the “brave officers” who “get it right most of the time” (they showed three wrongful arrests who had to go through painstaking processes to clear their names; Ganeesha only knows how many of the 90 other convictions were actually innocent as well but didn’t make it through those hoops/taxes on time). But it turns out the drug detection officers are more accurate than the crime lab that showed their urine was clean. Sounds legit. Lastly, a shout out to MADD who showered the officers with awards and public praise for their “policework” (sic). Donations, credentials, police state, and a legal system calibrated to impoverish the poor (cf the waitress losing her license to work). Sounds like one big happy circle of self-licking ice cream cones.

The hospital bill is $200.00, the insurance negotiates it to $75.00 and pays it. I am suppose to pay 20% but I get a hospital bill for $125.00 . What gives? Reply ↓ jrs May 11, 2017 at 2:30 pm You have probably not reached your deductible yet (assuming you have a deductible, some HMOs and VERY fancy PPOs don’t). So the 20% part won’t kick in until you meet your deductible. And if it’s out-of-network all bets are off. Where the numbers are even coming from down to the dollar though, who knows :). Is $125 worth fighting the insurance company for for you? Just make sure you understand all the deductible in-network/out-of-network info first if you do. There is a social benefit of people fighting the insurance companies on these games (calling up and getting our money back) as otherwise they will just continue them even more so. So it’s a good thing to do. But one can be too tired to bother, especially knowing how much of a pain it can be, if by some miracle they came out of a hospital (really? must not have done much?) only owing $125. Reply ↓ Anon May 11, 2017 at 3:34 pm Balance billing. First, ask if tests and all individuals a patient interacts with are in network. Second, ask if each transaction (test/business owner) balance bills. The answer is becoming more often ‘yes’.

First it was US auto loans as the new looming subprime crisis, then Australian mortgage and household debt vulnerability to a house price crash, then auto loans and credit debt in the UK (yesterday) and now it’s the same story from Canada – rising house prices, and credit card and car loan debt, combined there with bank downgrades. The survey, carried out by Ipsos for insolvency consultancy MNP, highlights the fallout from the debt binge Canadian consumers have gone on. Household debt reached an all-time high above 167 per cent of disposable income in the fourth quarter of 2016. MNP places some of the blame for that on rising house prices, but data shows Canadians are taking on more credit card and car loan debt as well. US auto is obviously a small part of US household debt, but Canada and Australia are at record private sector debt levels and are exposed to commodity slumps, while UK is Brexit affected.

Reply ↓ John Wright May 12, 2017 at 12:57 am It is not as if the typical American corporation is flush with cash. http://fortune.com/2016/05/20/corporate-america-debt/ “Studying S&P’s universe of more than 2,000 non-financial corporations, S&P’s researchers found that corporate issuers of debt had on hand a record $1.84 trillion in cash. But that statistic doesn’t tell us very much about the health of individual companies, because it appears cash is more concentrated at the top than ever. The top 1% of corporate cash holders, which translates in to 25 large companies—a group dominated by big tech companies like Apple (aapl, -0.05%), Microsoft (msft, -0.17%), and Google-owner Alphabet (googl, -0.21%)—have slightly more than half of the total cash pile of Corporate America. That’s up from 38% just five years ago.” “If you remove the top 25 cash holders, you’ll find that for most of Corporate America, cash on hand is declining even as these companies rack up more and more debt at historic rates. The bottom 99% of corporate borrowers have just $900 billion in cash on hand to back up $6 trillion in debt. “This resulted in a cash-to-debt ratio of 12%—the lowest recorded over the past decade, including the years preceding the Great Recession,” the report reads.” For every debtor there must be a creditor, so pension/bond funds must be holding this debt and the top 25 must have invested their cash in some debt instrument. Maybe some is also on the Fed’s books It will be interesting if many corporations decide to sell more equity to raise cash. The “all time corporate profits” are not translating to a lot of cash on hand for many corporations. .

Also they typically buy the stock when it is a terrible buy. Insiders supposedly buy the stock when they know in advance that there will be really good news so the stock price will rise. By contrast, stock buybacks are to force the stock price up in the presumed absence of near term good news. Reply ↓ John Wright May 12, 2017 at 9:06 am The corporate stock buybacks were viewed as stock manipulation until 1982 when Reagan’s SEC head, John Shad, allowed them for some background https://hbr.org/2014/09/profits-without-prosperity “The allocation of corporate profits to stock buybacks deserves much of the blame. Consider the 449 companies in the S&P 500 index that were publicly listed from 2003 through 2012. During that period those companies used 54% of their earnings—a total of $2.4 trillion—to buy back their own stock, almost all through purchases on the open market. Dividends absorbed an additional 37% of their earnings. That left very little for investments in productive capabilities or higher incomes for employees” Corporate stock buybacks should be greeted with derision as they are, in effect, a corporation announcing they have scoured the world attempting to find a good use for corporate cash. The corporation could find no better use of the cash for business expansion, product development, employee training, employee hiring, facility improvement OR an acquisition of intellectual property/another company. Amazingly, with all the opportunities available to them, many US corporations see the best use, of cash and borrowed cash, is to buy their OWN stock. If US corporations, en masse, decide that they need to do “reverse buybacks” (sell stock to raise cash) it might have an interesting effect on the stock market.

Any level of natural self-esteem or self-compassion probably comes from parents that actually like their kids as people, and don’t abuse them or neglect them, and aren’t too busy with their own issues to parent, and maybe actually help their kids deal with life. But since noone chooses their parents, that’s just the luck of the draw.

So don’t actively train yourself to try to acheive self esteem, train yourself to have compassion for yourself, because it is much more durable. It’s similar to other studies that Yves references that people that try to be happy end up not being happy because life is not perfect.

The latter would be the ones who fit the ‘always full of themselves’ picture. The former may superficially come across as full of themselves, but are actually quite fragile and ready to feel slighted and pissed off. Useful distinction, in my experience. Aside from parents, I’d like to give a causal nod to good old economics and employment relations. One of the themes the Frankfurt School would bang on was the idea that, in the face of overwhelming objective power, the subject can be encouraged to max their sense of subjective worth. In a feudal society this wouldn’t go over very well, since such a mindset might quickly translate into revolt. In a capitalist society, with marketized forms of exploitation, the tendency is to believe you’re chock full of human capital and ready to be bought, even though objective conditions are working against. Also, let’s throw in how there are big swathes of employment that involve maxxing personal appeal. Trying to project charisma can get you into trouble if you’re a plumber, but not if you’re in sales. You’ve got it, and you want to make the buyer think that the purchase will lead to some rubbing off. What Baran and Sweezy called the “sales effort” is like mushroom compost for a narcissistic presentation. That said, someone who is clinically narcissistic will end up looking very different from someone who … let’s say “suffers from occupationally driven narcissism.” It makes a big difference if you have a parent telling you that you’re either god or a piece of crap when you’re two years old as compared to getting a blandly affirmative orientation to self in middle school.

The point is not to just stop when you have self-compassioned yourself — got to go on to the other part.

Exactly 70 years ago in April 1947, an ambitious band of economists crafted a neoliberal story of the economy and, since Thatcher and Reagan came to power in the 1980s, it has dominated the international stage. Its narrative about the efficiency of the market, the incompetence of the state, the domesticity of the household and the tragedy of the commons, has helped to push many societies towards social and ecological collapse. It’s time to write a new economic story fit for this century – one that sees the economy’s dependence upon society and the living world. This story must recognize the power of the market—so let’s embed it wisely; the partnership of the state—so let’s hold it to account; the core role of the household—so let’s value its contribution; and the creativity of the commons—so let’s unleash their potential. http://evonomics.com/seven-ways-transform-21st-century-economics-economists/ Reply ↓ Toolate May 12, 2017 at 12:13 am Thanks for this link Reply ↓ MikeW_CA May 11, 2017 at 3:40 pm “But you have to give cred­it to Trump and his cam­paign.

WTF? What part of “take any two similar-sized randomly generated prime p and q and multiply tem together to generate a public key” is hugely complex? Also it’s now known that RSA was in bed with the spooks and actively working to weaken crypto standards via backdooring – Greenwald might have mentioned those types of standards-hacking-based initiatives, which are designed specifically to undermine popular crypto schemes and bring key-cracking within the realm of precisely the kinds of hardware described. You think your 4096-bit RSA is safe, but in fact it’s been backdoored so as to allow NSA et al to break it in reasonable time using their fancy hardware. More stuff that omits crucial additional material: “Spy shops like the NSA can sometimes thwart encryption by going around it, finding flaws in the way programmers build their apps or taking advantage of improperly configured devices.” Or physically interdicting shipments of tech on their way to intelligence-deemed persons of interest and ‘improperly configuring’ said devices via software, firmware and even actual hardware implants, as the spooks are known to do. That allows them to bypass an encryption entirely by way of simply intercepting the user’s keystrokes. Reply ↓ MoiAussie May 11, 2017 at 7:40 pm Hugely complex numbers, as shorthand for large numbers which are hugely difficult to find, given only the product. It’s just the usual loss of precision in scientific reporting. Regarding “omits crucial additional material”, what do you expect? It’s long enough already. As for 4096-bit RSA being backdoored or cracked, I don’t believe that to be the case. Please provide a link to a credible claim. It’s certainly vulnerable to side-channel attack, but that’s not cracking, it’s snooping on a decryption process to copy the private decryption key. Mathematically it is impossible to decrypt RSA encryption without knowing the key in a feasible amount of time. For 4096 bit key encryption, the time may exceed the shelf life of the Milky Way Galaxy. But there are side channel attacks that one can perform. This means there are ways to exploit the vulnerabilities that exist in the implementation of the RSA encryption/decryption algorithm in a device. This includes measuring variations in CPU voltage, noise produced by a device during encryption/decryption of a RSA encrypted message (the messages are generally AES keys). Attacks can also be at the software level which exploit unchecked memory read/write or by infecting shared libraries. 1024-bit RSA is of course known to be vulnerable, and you’re right that some standards, particularly anything based on NSA algorithms, are not trustworthy, but this was suspected from the start. Personally, I’d be more worried about trapdoors in Diffie-Helman primes. Reply ↓ MoiAussie May 11, 2017 at 8:25 pm Above is (yet again) linked in the wrong place – was replying to ewmayer at 6:52 pm Reply ↓ ewmayer May 11, 2017 at 9:23 pm We do know RSA conspired with the NSA to backdoor so-called elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) – why would you deem it unreasonable to believe that they might have done similarly with their flagship RSA crypto? And note also this chilling 2012 piece from James Bamford: According to another top official also involved with the program, the NSA made an enormous breakthrough several years ago in its ability to cryptanalyze, or break, unfathomably complex encryption systems employed by not only governments around the world but also many average computer users in the US. The upshot, according to this official: “Everybody’s a target; everybody with communication is a target.” “Breakthrough” here might imply something like a so-called L(1/4)-complexity scheme to crack ECC or similar for RSA – that is, development of an attack with asymptotically reduced computational complexity than the thought-to-be-fastest approaches-in-the-academic-community for general-purpose integer factorization (RSA) pr solving the discrete logarithm problem (ECC). That would allow crypto-breaking of selected targets even without any backdooring, It would also involve the kind of “keys to the kingdom” secrecy the government would literally kill to keep, starting with extreme compartmentalization: only a handful of the NSA’s top mathematicians are privy to the details, and all one anyone else outside that tiny circle in the agency or the government sees is “we are building a new improved computer”, not in itself revealing because the kinds of basic mathematical operations involved in all such crypto crackage are public. The secret sauce would lie in the software deployed on same. Reply ↓ MoiAussie May 12, 2017 at 12:16 am Yes, RSA’s misbehaviour is well known, but the ECC backdoor relates to deliberately weakened Random Number Generators (RNG) for key generation which are easily avoided. With RSA you get to choose the key, so you don’t need to use a compromised one. Historically, it’s easy to forget that strong crypto used to be export controlled by the USG, so RSA’s actions back in the day are more understandable. Pressure was probably applied. I couldn’t see any link from you to a claim 4096-bit RSA is cracked. And there are in any case plenty of non-RSA alternatives to use. BTW, your first link is dead, all text and no href. Concerning the breakthrough scare story, that I suspect is all about Diffie-Hellman trapdoors, especially going by “employed by … many average computer users in the US”. This involves possible “weak primes” in RFC5114 that allow easy cracking of encrypted web traffic, VPNs, or forging of certificates. Easy in this case means 400 core-years for 1024-bit keys, which is maybe hours using all of WindsorGreen. But 2048-bit weakened keys would still need about 6.4 billion core-years which is hundreds or thousands of years. Finally, speculation about the NSA having the keys to the kingdom via asymptotically reduced complexity algorithms is on a par with them having same due to a large scale functional quantum computing installation: unknown but unlikely. In any case, appropriate choices of crypto are available that make it possible to secure anything you fully control, but don’t ever expect that to be true of someone else’s web server, or your bank site. There’s plenty of 1k-bit RSA and probably SHA-1 certificates around on the web – they’re still on sale. Reply ↓ ewmayer May 12, 2017 at 3:56 am My bad – the first link should read https://www.wired.com/2013/09/nsa-backdoor/all/ “With RSA you get to choose the key” — how so? By approving or rejecting certificates, you mean? And even if in theory that is true, on what basis would you choose (one) 4096-bit key over another? All those will be based on similar-length prime pairs and thus equally impossible-looking to crack. Well-designed back doors are by design invisible to those not-in-the-know. “appropriate choices of crypto are available that make it possible to secure anything you fully control” — if you fully control it, there’s no need for crypto to begin with! The whole point is that out on the web, no one fully controls *anything* – our e-mail passes through multiple servers, and your average PC is now so immensely complex that it offers multiple targets for firmware implants, especially to a state-level actor which can literally interdict hardware shipments at will. I dearly hope you are right about the safety of modern ‘strong crypto’, but I fear your trust is going to prove overly optimistic. Reply ↓ MoiAussie May 12, 2017 at 10:44 am Sorry, I meant you get to choose the RSA key generation algorithm, assuming you use software that gives you such a choice, which you should, and you understand what you’re doing or follow a trustworthy recipe. I didn’t mean choosing between actual keys. If you really care, you also choose on what platform to generate your keys. On full control, I meant that you can choose to encrypt your data by means that render it most unlikely to be cracked with any resources available today or in the near future. It can then safely be stored or transit the insecure internet opaquely. I did not mean that common applications and infrastructure on the net actually make these kind of safe choices, or that individuals can easily protect themselves against all the other modes of attack that a well-resourced actor might employ. Reply ↓ hunkerdown May 12, 2017 at 4:07 am Not weak primes, but pre-shared primes. Even modest 1024-bit isn’t quite as easy as it looks, if you generate a new group with each connection instead of using a pre-shared group. This was not common practice, presumably under the assumption that well-vetted primes were more important than diversity. I excerpt Green et al.’s “Imperfect Forward Secrecy” paper for details: Millions of HTTPS, SSH, and VPN servers all use the same prime numbers for Diffie-Hellman key exchange. Practitioners believed this was safe as long as new key exchange messages were generated for every connection. However, the first step in the number field sieve—the most efficient algorithm for breaking a Diffie-Hellman connection—is dependent only on this prime. After this first step, an attacker can quickly break individual connections. Green and his team built a proof-of-concept system to downgrade connections to export-grade and decrypt them, by computing 512-bit discrete logarithms modulo a specified group prime in a median time of 70 seconds each. The hardware used was surprisingly modest, with 90k core-hours devoted to precomputing a 2.5GB database, ready to use by the last step of the process running on two beefy 18-core Intel servers with 128GB RAM each. To do the same for a limited number of 1024-bit groups is “plausibly within the resources of state-level attackers. The precomputation would likely require special-purpose hardware, but would not require any major algorithmic improvements beyond what is known in the academic literature.” Note that the NSA has their own chip fab and so has all-you-can-eat special-purpose hardware. If you like, just skip to section 4, “State-Level Threats to DH”: (emphasis in original) Finally, we apply this new understanding to a set of recently published documents leaked by Edward Snowden [46] to evaluate the hypothesis that the National Security Agency has already implemented such a capability. We show that this hypothesis is consistent with the published details of the intelligence community’s cryptanalytic capabilities, and, indeed, matches the known capabilities more closely than other proposed explanations, such as novel breaks on RC4 or AES. 4096-bit seems safe to me, but who knows what’s going on under Bluffdale, Utah. Reply ↓ MoiAussie May 12, 2017 at 10:24 am I hope Lambert isn’t bothered by our wasting so many electrons here on this geek stuff. Familiar with the Green et al paper and Logjam. The trapdoored primes I was referring to are indeed pre-shared, but also weak. They have been carefully chosen to make them significantly more vulnerable to attack, but that vulnerablity is very difficult to detect if you don’t have the seed. From the abstract of A kilobit hidden SNFS discrete logarithm computation by Fried et al from last year: Our chosen prime p looks random, and p−1 has a 160-bit prime factor, in line with recommended parameters for the Digital Signature Algorithm. However, our p has been trapdoored in such a way that the special number field sieve can be used to compute discrete logarithms in F^∗_p , yet detecting that p has this trapdoor seems out of reach. Twenty-five years ago, there was considerable controversy around the possibility of backdoored parameters for DSA. Our computations show that trapdoored primes are entirely feasible with current computing technology. For these special trapdoored 1024-bit primes, they demonstrate that computing the database needed to routinely attack traffic using the prime is at least 10,000 times easier than it would be for “honest” 1024-bit primes, putting it within the power of pretty much any actor, not just state actors as the Green paper had suggested. From the paper’s conclusion: Dismissing the risk of trapdoored primes in real usage appears to have been a mistake, as the apparent difficulties encountered by the trapdoor designer in 1992 turn out to be easily circumvented. A more conservative design decision for FIPS 186 would have required mandatory seed publication instead of making it optional. As a result, there are opaque, standardized 1024-bit and 2048-bit primes in wide use today that cannot be properly verified. To summarise: – Much of internet security infrastructure using 1024-bit pre-shared keys is vulnerable to state-level cracking, especially if based on widely used groups. – Some such 1024-bit keys are vulnerable to cracking by lower resourced actors as well, and this may include some based on non-widely used groups. – Non-verifiable primes (no published seed) should be avoided. – Use at least 2048-bit and preferably 4096-bit keys.

On Friday and Saturday, Habitat for Humanity construction supervisors will lead crews of women volunteers and anyone who wishes to join them in building walls for a new home for a single mother and her children that will go up in Jonesborough later this year. The building will take place from 9 a.m.-noon, and 1-4 p.m. both days at the new Habitat Restore located off West Mountain View Road at 3201 Kimberly Court near the the Browns Mill Road Walmart. Holston Habitat has dubbed it a “Women Build” event, but is inviting everyone, including men, “to build like a woman in your mother’s name.” In addition to nailing nails and constructing walls, volunteers will also have the opportunity to write messages to the Habitat family who will live in the house or to memorialize their mothers, or other influential women in their lives by writing their names on the boards that will shape the house. Lunch will be provided and all participants will receive a Women Build T-shirt. Volunteer Coordinator Mandy Penz said the goal is to have fun, learn something new about construction and help other women all in honor of mothers. “Every hand makes a difference,” Penz said. “What better way to honor your mother than to join other women and build strength, stability and self-reliance alongside a Habitat family right here in our community?” Anyone who wishes to join in may sign up online at www.HolstonHabitat.org or call the Holston Habitat office at 423-239-7689 to register. More information about Holston Habitat’s work to make homeownership possible for income-eligible residents of Carter, Sullivan and Washington counties in Tennessee and Bristol, Virginia, is also available at the above website or phone number. Those who cannot take part but wish to honor their mothers by supporting Holston Habitat for Humanity during the Women Build project may make tax-deductible donations on behalf of their moms online at www.HolstonHabitat.org or by mail to P.O. Box 5265, Kingsport, TN 37663. The Southern Appalachian Highlands Conservancy will mark 43 years of conservation of the region’s natural treasures Thursday, May 18, with a benefit Appalachian Spring Celebration at the Yee-Haw Brewing Company in Johnson City. “From the world renowned Roan Highlands to Hampton Creek Cove State Natural Area, and more recently our brand new Rocky Fork State Park, we see the amazing work of SAHC in the protected mountain landscape of Northeast Tennessee,” former SAHC Trustee and Mahoney’s Outfitters Manager David Ramsey said. More than 70,000 acres of the mountains of Tennessee and North Carolina, clean water sources, impressive overlooks, unique habitats, productive farmland and outdoor recreation venues have been protected by the SAHC in those 43 years. And everyone will have an opportunity to build on that legacy at the family-friendly celebration at Yee-Haw. A ticketed event, the night will include live music on the patio by by Redleg Husky, an Americana group from Asheville, N.C., outdoor games, presentation of the conservancy’s 2017 Stanley A. Murray Volunteer of the Year award and savory local brews from which Yee-Haw will be passing along $1 to SAHC for every beer sold. Food from White Duck Taco will also be available for purchase onsite. Yee-Haw Taproom General Manager David McDaniel said the Appalachian Spring Celebration is a SAHC event that the company is most excited to host. “It is our goal to help organizations like the SAHC succeed and be effective and, in turn, ensure the success of the region around us.” Tickets are $10 in advance or $15 at the door and may be purchased online at www.Appalachian.org. More information about the conservancy is available at the website or may be obtained by calling the SAHC at 828-253-0095. Donations to the Southern Appalachian Highlands Conservancy may be made by mail to 372 Merrimon Ave., Asheville, NC 28801.

One child got sick from ingesting tampered formula but is in good condition after being treated at a hospital and released May 5, police said late Thursday. Police Chief Chris Magnus held an unusual nighttime news conference to disclose the arrest and to warn the public. "We're concerned about this and wanted to get the information out as quickly as possible to avoid any other children from becoming sick," Magnus said. Police said the suspect was motivated by money and apparently took place over at least several days and possibly for up to two months. The formula was either purchased or stolen, police said. Dr. Francisco Garcia, chief medical officer for Pima County, said tests are being conducted to determine whether other substances were put in formula containers along with flour, such as something to make it more palatable. Police said Jennifer LaPlante, 30, was arrested Thursday on suspicion of fraudulent schemes and artifices and child endangerment. LaPlante remained jailed Friday. It wasn't immediately known whether she has an attorney who could comment on the allegations. Police listed two Fry's grocery stores and two Wal-Mart stores, all on Tucson's eastside, that are linked to the incident. Officials at Arkansas-based Wal-Mart said they don't restock baby formula and are "deeply disturbed" by the Tucson incident. "Our customers deserve safe, quality foods, and we have policies in place to help ensure that returned baby formula is not put back on our shelves," Wal-Mart spokesman Ragan Dickens said in a statement. A police department spokesman, Sgt. Pete Dugan, said Friday he wasn't aware of additional reports of tampered formula. However, detectives remained "smack-dab in the middle of the investigation," Dugan said. "They need to find out if there's others involved. They need to find out if there's other stores involved." Officials advised recent purchasers of infant formula from Tucson businesses to check seals on containers and to see whether the formula smelled normal. Parents shouldn't feed infants with any formula if there's any question of possible tampering, Garcia said. "Those seals should be intact," he said. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

The Tucson Police Department hosted a late night news conference Thursday to warn residents to be on their guard. Here are the top five things you need to know. The Suspect Jennifer Laplante, 30, has been arrested on charges of child endangerment and fraudulent schemes. She could face more charges, according to the TPD. Laplante is being held in the Pima County Jail on a $50,000 bond. The TPD said she bought the formula, replaced it with flour, sugar and rice cereal, resealed the cans and returned them to the store for a refund. One child had to be treated at the hospital after digesting the tainted formula. The child was released May 5 and is in good condition, according to the Associated Press. The TPD did not say how the victim was connected to Laplante. The Locations Police said Laplante returned formula from several stores on Tucson's east side, including: • Fry's, 7050 East 22nd St. • Fry's, 9401 East 22nd St. • Walmart, 8640 Broadway Blvd. • Walmart, 7150 East Speedway. On Friday the TPD confirmed the formula that made the child sick was sold at the Fry's at 7050 E. 22nd St. There could be other possible stores where the tainted product was returned, but the TPD has not released those locations yet. "In abundance of caution, I would suggest that where ever parents are purchasing this product, they give it an added level of scrutiny," said TPD Chief Chris Magnus said. "We cannot rule out that there are other locations where this type of activity has gone on." The TPD said the have removed any old stock of formula from the shelves and replaced it with new formula. The detectives are still conducting searches to verify any and all returns Ms. Laplante conducted. How Did This Happen? "We checked all the other brands of baby formula to make sure there wasn't any other tampering just as a precaution,"said Fry's spokesperson pic.twitter.com/3bJWByZB2e— Monica Grimaldo (@monicagrimaldo_) May 12, 2017 Most super markets either refuse to accept baby formula returns or have policies against restocking these items when they are returned. Officials at Arkansas-based Wal-Mart told the Associated Press they don't restock baby formula and are "deeply disturbed" by the Tucson incident. "Like everyone else, we are deeply disturbed by this situation and take it very seriously," a Walmart spokesperson told Tucson News Now "Our customers deserve safe, quality foods, and we have policies in place to help ensure that returned baby formula is not put back on our shelves. We are working with local law enforcement, and because this an ongoing investigation, we must refer all other questions to them." A spokesman for Fry's said they also do not restock baby formula. "Once it's returned to our stores for an exchange or refund, it will immediately be stickered with a 'Not for Resale' label and then it will be disposed of." The Fry's spokesperson said they have checked other baby formulas on the shelf to make sure they are safe. "We checked all the other brands of baby formula to make sure there wasn't any other tampering just as a precaution," the spokesperson said. The Formula Police said anyone who uses Gerber Good Start Soy powdered formula should be extra careful. But the TPD also warned that Laplante may have tampered with other brands as well. If you bought the formula from one of the stores, the TPD said you should: • Examine the container carefully. • If it lacks a seal or the seal is broke, don't use it. • If it smells funny or different, don't use it. What To Do Now Anyone with questionable formula is asked to bring it to the Tucson Police Department for testing. Authorities said parents should not throw it out or try to return it to the store. Instead, they are asking parents to drop it off at their evidence facility, located at 945 East Ohio St. The TPD, FDA and Pima County Health Department are participating in the investigation. Anyone with questions or information should call the TPD at 520-791-5059. Why Did She Do It? Jennifer Laplante appears in court While Laplante has not spoken public about the case yet, police said she was apparently motivated by money. They said the alleged scheme took place over at least several days and possibly for up to two months. The formula was either purchased or stolen, police said.

(Courtesy: Erin Plew) Related Coverage Tad Cummins appears in federal court in Nashville NASHVILLE, Tenn. (WKRN) – A special agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation testified in court Friday during a hearing for Tad Cummins, the former Maury County teacher accused of kidnapping a 15-year-old student. A judge deemed the 50-year-old a flight risk, ordering he remain in custody until his upcoming trial, a date for which has yet to be set. Special Agent Utley Noble testified on behalf of the prosecution, detailing the cross-country trip Cummins took with 15-year-old Elizabeth Thomas. The two were the subject of a 38-day AMBER Alert, traveling from Columbia, Tennessee, to rural northern California where they were eventually found by a young man from Brentwood, Tennessee. Agent Noble testified the details were admitted by Cummins upon his capture on April 20, saying he confessed to arranging to switch cars with his wife on March 13, filling up at a Columbia gas station, and picking up the 15-year-old student. He also left his wife a note, saying he needed to “clear my mind of all this crap.” The letter Tad Cummins left for his wife, Jill, the morning he disappeared March 13, 2017. The two first traveled south to Decatur, Alabama, where they reportedly threw their phones into the Tennessee River. At some point, Cummins reportedly admitted to disabling the GPS on his car and replacing his license plate with one from Alabama. Previous story: Tad Cummins appears in federal court in Nashville After leaving Decatur, they traveled to Birmingham and started heading west to Mississippi, staying in Mississippi for at least one night before heading northwest to Oklahoma. While there, they were caught on surveillance at two different Walmart stores. Agent Noble says one of the items Cummins purchased was an iPad in order to stay up to date with news about the case and know what was being reported. Cummins also reportedly admitted to seeing the plea from his wife, who spoke at a press conference on March 17 asking her husband to “do the right thing.” From Oklahoma, Cummins and Thomas headed to Colorado where they began using aliases. The FBI agent says they presented themselves as John and Joann Castro, ages 40 and 24 respectively, a married couple. Cummins reportedly chose a Hispanic last name since their ultimate destination was Mexico. Agent Noble testified the duo then drove to southern California where they purchased a kayak in San Diego. Previously released court documents said the goal was to travel by boat to cross the U.S. border into Mexico. Tad Cummins in court on May 12, 2017. (Courtesy: Erin Plew) Cummins reportedly told the FBI that while testing the kayak, he ran into a law enforcement officer who gave them tips about the boat. He and Thomas were out on the water when that same officer came out to warn them the water was rough. Cummins assumed they’d been found out and became scared, sleeping with his gun beside him from then on our, the FBI agent said. After leaving San Diego, they drove about 150 miles west to Slab City, a commune in the Sonoran Desert. It’s not known how long they stayed before they began traveling north. Ultimately, the two met Griffin Barry, the Brentwood native who works as the caretaker of a rural California property. The FBI agent testified Barry felt bad for Cummins and Thomas, befriending them and filling their car up with gas. From there, Cummins and Thomas reportedly traveled to the Black Bear Ranch, a commune tucked into a rough, mountainous region in Siskiyou County, California. After staying at the commune for two days, a member reportedly asked them to leave. As previously reported, Cummins trusted Barry and traveled back to his property. Barry told them they could stay at a cabin on the property as long as they agreed to work, but within 48 hours, the young man became suspicious, ultimately calling 911 when he realized who Cummins and Thomas were. Cummins faces charges in Tennessee of kidnapping and sexual contact with a minor after he allegedly kissed Thomas while at school. Federally, the 50-year-old faces one count of transportation of a minor across state lines for the purpose of having criminal sexual intercourse.

Tweet Print Email I Want Cheese and I Want It Now! 5/12/2017 11:34:00 AM By Susan Tipton-Fox Tags: beginners cheesemaking, rennet, micro-dairy, farmstead cheese, Susan Tipton-Fox, The Mushroom Hut @ Fox Farms, North Carolina, We usually start our cheese making workshops, here at our farm The Mushroom Hut @ Fox Farms/Micro Dairy, in Summer. Ours is a goat dairy. We have pure Saanen, Nubian and a mix of Saanen/Nubian. The Saanen gives volume where the Nubian gives high fat content and the Saanen/Nubian mix gives the best of both worlds! Waiting for the Milk: Breeding season, for us, starts anywhere between October and December. We decide when we want the goats to kid (the does and kids do better when it starts getting warmer) usually the last of April. We take that date and count backwards 145-155 days (approx. gestation period) to see when we want to breed the goats. This also depends on estrus of the goats. If they have gone past their estrus cycle we will have to wait another cycle (approx. 21-28 days). We do not take the kids away from their mothers. We leave them until they have been weaned. We do take any excess milk they have during this time. Now...it's time for Cheesemaking: Milking and cheesemaking starts in earnest for us around the last of May to the first of June. In years past we have only milked by hand. As arthritis sets in, we are now using a milking machine. We can conduct workshops on making different types of cheeses but are only licensed to make/sell aged cheeses. We do have a "farm kitchen" where the milk and cheese are processed. The milk goes directly from the milking parlor to the farm kitchen. You do not want to leave your milk out for too long before processing or refrigeration. This can cause "off" flavors in your product. Some of the cheeses we make here are our Homebrew Cheddar, Chived Cheddar and Hopping and Wining Tomme. The Hopping Tomme and Homebrew Cheddar are brine washed in a beer made from our hops to reduce mold growth. The Wining Tomme is brine washed in wine made here from Wineberries. After developing a hard rind (about 3 days of air drying) we use beeswax (wax we save from our honey harvest) to coat. We make a Chevre that we use in our poundcakes. One of the most simple and versatile cheeses we show people how to make is our Queso Blanco...or vinegar cheese. You can start this in the morning and have it for your evening meal! This cheese doesn't require rennet or culture. Items Needed: Stainless Steel pot (that will hold at least 1 gal.) or enamel. Never use aluminum with milk. Thick cheesecloth (or muslin), ladle, thermometer (candy or digital) and colander (preferably stainless). Note: I use "flour sack" towels you can get from Wal-Mart instead of cheesecloth. This cheese has a variety of uses. It does not melt but can be baked, deep-fried, used in stir-fries, sauces and used as a substitute for tofu. It has a similar texture to Mozzarella. It is also referred to as Paneer/Panir. Depending on the fat content of the milk. Yield: 1 1/2-2 lbs. Ingredients 1 gal. (whole milk) 1/4 cup vinegar (either kind, you can also substitute lemon juice) Kosher salt as desired Directions: 1. In a large (stainless steel or enamel) pot, directly heat at med./high heat the milk to 185-190 degrees. Keep stirring during this time trying to keep from scorching the milk. 2. Using a thermometer (you can use a candy or digital thermometer) keep a watch on the temp. When you get to 190 slowly add the vinegar, a little at a time, until you see the curds and whey begin to seperate. You can go up to 200 degrees but, do NOT boil. 3. When the curds have settled, ladle into a colander lined with cheesecloth. 4. Tie the corners, when cool enough to handle, into a knot and hang the bag somewhere it can drain (possibly over the sink) for several hours or until the texture suits you. 5. Remove the cheese from the cheesecloth and eat fresh or prepare for later use. The cheese can now be crumbled (add salt and/or herbs if desired) and used like feta or can be molded (also with herbs or berries if you wish). This cheese can be frozen or stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks. NOTE: This cheese is great to cut up in small chunks and put inside homemade hush puppies. You can also batter these then deep fry. This cheese can be soaked in wine, fruit juice or other to take on different flavors for dessert! Making and Selling Cheeses from Your Homestead/Farm: You will need a milking parlor. Specification for us, North Carolina, is sloping floor with drain and washable walls and stanchion/stand. We also had to have a double sink with a designated side for hand-washing (with sign). You need warm water which we were able to provide with a tankless water heater that heats as needed or "on demand". Milk needs to be milked into stainless steel containers/pails. The milk needs to be taken directly to the "cheese kitchen" or designated area for processing the milk. Milk needs to be strained immediately and processed or refrigerated. The state Food Inspector will have to inspect and approve your set-up before you can begin selling your product. If the cheeses made are for you and your family there is no limit to the varieties you can make and enjoy. On the other hand if the product is to be sold there are guidelines for each state. You can contact your local Cooperative Extension Agency for help or more info. You can also go directly to your Dept. of Agriculture and speak with one of the Food Inspectors. We are a micro-dairy and do not have a commercial pasteurizer so we must use raw milk in our cheeses. If using raw milk, NC regulations require us to "age" our cheeses 60 days before selling. Batches of our milk must be sent for testing but our state provides the sampling containers, labels and test for free! In order to "age" cheese you need a constant temperature (for our cheeses we need 55-60 degrees Fahrenheit) and we don't have a cheese cave. We got permission to use a small "dorm" refrigerator that we keep at the temp we need. These cheeses must be turned every day. If you are wanting to make different kinds of cheeses and can source pasteurized milk from a licensed dairy that is another option. Susan Tipton-Fox continues the farming and preserving practices that have been passed down to her by her family. She presents on-farm workshops in Yancey County, North Carolina, and growing her on-farm agritourism by promoting "workshop stays" on the farm (extending the farm experience).

REUTERS/Leonhard Foeger By Nandita Bose | CHICAGO CHICAGO German discount supermarket chain Lidl is set to open its first set of U.S. stores this summer, raising the stakes for American grocery chain operators who have been caught in an intense price war. Lidl said in February it planned to open its first 20 U.S. stores in North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia, with 80 more to follow in the United States within the first year. Lidl's entry comes at a time when Wal-Mart Stores Inc is running price tests in 11 states, pushing vendors to undercut rivals by 15 percent. The world's biggest retailer is expected to spend about $6 billion (4.65 billion pounds) to regain its title as the low-price leader, analysts said. Another rival, German discounter Aldi Inc, is aiming for prices 21 percent below its U.S. competition and is aggressively expanding its presence. Lidl and Aldi have already upended Britain's grocery retail market, hurting incumbents like Tesco Plc and ASDA, the British supermarket arm of Wal-Mart. Lidl (which rhymes with "needle") is owned by Germany's privately held Schwarz Group. It operates more than 10,000 stores in 27 countries. The German chain's U.S. CEO, Brendan Proctor, will address Lidl's U.S. expansion plans at a New York press event on Tuesday. According to the company's website, it is hiring workers in 38 cities in the eastern U.S. states of Delaware, Georgia, Maryland, New Jersey, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina and Virginia. "The growth of Aldi and Lidl will require existing U.S. grocery retailers to start asking themselves how they can do things differently to control costs – from marketing and merchandising to operations and logistics," Bill Bishop, co-founder of retail consultancy Bricks Meets Clicks, said in an interview on Friday. Lidl is expected to post U.S. sales of roughly $1 billion in 2018, $2 billion in 2019 and $4 billion 2020, assuming it opens just under 100 stores per year, according to a recent note by retail think tank Fung Global Retail and Technology. This would put Lidl in close range of U.S. grocery chains like Ingles market, which had revenue of $3.2 billion in 2016; Sprouts Farmers Market with $4.3 billion in sales last year and SuperValu Inc, which posted sales of $4.8 billion, the report said. Analyst estimates suggest Lidl is eying more than 330 U.S stores by 2020. The retailer has opened three distribution centers in Maryland, North Carolina and Virginia.

Exchange is a localized effort to help boost entrepreneurship in Northwest Arkansas. Its purpose is to facilitate connections between entrepreneurs and enterprises by offering free co-working space to select NWA startups, who can apply to use the space and its services through the Exchange website. Exchange is housed in the renovated Farmers Exchange building at 409 S.W A St., just a few blocks south of the downtown square. The building is owned by an LLC registered to Bentonville businessman Randy Lawson. Since February, it’s been the headquarters of software development startup RevUnit, which relocated from its previous location on Main Street. “At RevUnit, we develop technology products that make work life better for enterprises, and as a startup ourselves, we are consistently seeking ways to make sure other startups receive support and collaboration from other businesses,” said RevUnit CEO Joe Saumweber. “Through Exchange, we can cultivate business development and growth throughout northwest Arkansas.” The principals behind the idea hope Exchange will be a place to provide mentorship from industry experts, and host meetups and events for the entrepreneurial and enterprise community to exchange ideas and spark growth. The venture is supported by Wal-Mart Stores. “We’re excited to support Exchange and boost the entrepreneurial ecosystem here in Northwest Arkansas,” said Randy Salley, Wal-Mart’s senior vice president of retail technology. “The new venture is intended to be a model for entrepreneurs and established businesses to build relationships, nurture ideas and promote the Northwest Arkansas economy.” Exchange will join existing resources for entrepreneurs and startups in Northwest Arkansas including Startup Junkie, Grit Studios and the Community Venture Foundation. The free co-working space at Exchange features teleconference rooms, free WiFi, free parking and other amenities.

Late last month, the UN Food and Agricultural Organization warned that "20 million people will starve to death over the next six months in South Sudan, Somalia, northeastern Nigera and Yemen" while, according to sources cited by Epp, "30 per cent of all food produced for Canadians is wasted, the equivalent of two per cent of the Canadian GDP." Canadians aren't alone, either. Worldwide, "if food waste was its own country, it would have the third-largest carbon footprint after the U.S. and China." Consumers are directly responsible for the lion's share of the spoilage, nearly 50 per cent. Bringing home bacon that we don't actually fry up in a pan appears to be a worsening phenomenon, too. According to Epp, "It's estimated since 1975, Canadians' per capita food waste has grown by 50 per cent." Most of us remember the old "eat your vegetables, there are starving kids in Africa" admonishment. Well those were the good old days, apparently, when peas and carrots actually made it to the table. Today, they're more likely to wither in the refrigerator: the slimy ghosts of good intentions gone bad. To date, retailers have borne the brunt of the negative press around this issue. It's easy to blame global food waste on stores we love to hate, like Walmart. Their vulnerability to hidden cameras and disgruntled employees make them easy targets, to be sure. And even though retailers are only responsible for about 10 per cent of food waste, undercover videos of industrial garbage bins overflowing with what might have been edible food are a compelling distraction to the mirror-holding exercise anyone who owns a refrigerator should be doing right now. (Go check your crisper. I dare you.) Unfortunately, no camera crew from Marketplace is going to show up at my house with a pair of rubber gloves to sift through the trash and do an investigative report about the two overripe avocados and the shrivelled orange that got tossed in there this morning. So what's my story? Am I contemptuous of the human and environmental effort required to grow avocados and oranges in the first place? Or am I callous and indifferent to the suffering of those who don't have enough to eat? It's neither. The truth is I don't believe any Canadian deliberately sets out to throw hard-earned money and resources in the garbage when we head to the grocery store. Maybe I've had too much exposure to Donald Trump lately, but there are at least a few things that are rigged, and not in the consumer's favour. At least one major problem is the bigger-is-better Costco-type mentality. That adage might be true when it comes to paper products. Who doesn't enjoy the almost euphoric sense of security in knowing there's a border wall of toilet paper bales stacked in a storage cupboard somewhere? But unless you're doing a raw vegetable cleanse, it's hard to munch through a three-pack of cucumbers before one of them returns to its original liquid form. Big box grocers consistently play up our fears that we might run out of something. The carts get bigger and we have slowly -- and somewhat mindlessly, if we're being totally honest -- bought into the notion of buying more than we need. Even our refrigerators have grown to accommodate the eyes that are way bigger than our stomachs: an average of 22.5 cubic feet, up from 19.6 cubic feet in 1980, according to the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers. It's a vicious cycle when it comes to fresh food, in particular, because overbuying quickly leads to losing track of a delicate inventory with limited shelf life. Additionally, we grossly underestimate the amount of time -- what's left of it after work, commuting, recreational sports, etc. -- it takes to prepare a well-balanced, home-cooked meal. Once upon a time, there was an army of family chefs who were experts at procurement, inventory management and food preparation. But as a society we dismissed their economic contribution. Labour force participation became the only measurable of value. And their indispensable life skills have now bypassed, for the most part, two full generations. The solution to the food waste epidemic is not to turn back the clock and send women back to the kitchen. But we owe our mothers and grandmothers an apology for having been blind to the heroic bottom-line impact of the humble housewife. Epp calls food inequality and waste a "Herculean" challenge. For this battle, Hercules needs an apron. Until someone can teach vegetables how to chop themselves and climb into a pot or an affordable home-chef robot goes to market, the banal evil of wasted food is, I fear, going to be with us for a long time. Until then, the best we can do is to shop with full bellies and eyes wide open. And if Grandma's still alive, ask her how she did it. She's probably still got a few tips and tricks up her sleeve.

After it appeared that President Trump was about to pull out of the Paris Agreement just ahead of a United Nations negotiating meeting this past week, the decision was abruptly postponed. Then, in a recent meeting of the eight nations of the Arctic Council, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson stated that the U.S. will now take its time to consider its approach to ensure that it is in line with U.S. interests: “We’re not going to rush to make a decision. We’re going to work to make the right decision for the United States.” Author Nathan Hultman Nonresident Senior Fellow - Global Economy and Development Twitter @natehultman A decision on Paris is now expected after the upcoming G-7 summit in Taormina, Italy, from May 26 to 27 where world leaders will likely present a united front in pressing for the U.S. to remain engaged. While the administration’s orientation toward international coordination on climate change has remained largely opaque, an approach that carefully considers the benefits to the U.S. would be a significant improvement over making this portentous decision simply based on a politically expedient campaign promise. As the White House mulls its decision, it should keep in mind how the world has evolved rapidly beyond problems that have plagued the economic, technological, and political approaches to climate policy in the past. Despite this, recent Trump administration statements have been erratic and have posited a number of outdated arguments that could easily be dated to the early George W. Bush administration or earlier. Just as today’s global climate toolkit has transformed, the domestic opportunities and logic of the current international approach should also change. If the White House does in fact intend to consider carefully its options, it should consider six shifts that have occurred over the past 20 years: America’s clean energy revolution makes new U.S. targets achievable. We are in a completely different energy market now compared to 20, 10, and even 5 years ago. Developments in the American energy technology portfolio have been rapid and surprising, as deployment and innovation has accelerated. Levels of clean energy deployment that would have been thought borderline infeasible 20 years ago are now not only in reach but can now be cost-competitive with, and in many situations cheaper than, fossil energy sources. And these trends will continue. Clean energy technologies like PV and LED light bulbs, and to some degree wind, are mass-manufactured and like similar items (e.g., smartphones) tend to become cheaper and better over time. As deployment of such technologies has accelerated globally over recent years, in large part due to clean energy policies in the U.S., Germany, U.K., India, and China, the increased production volumes have helped drive down costs. With many countries planning further rapid clean energy deployment in the coming decade to address climate change, we can expect continued improvements in the costs of clean energy technology. There are two implications of this trend. First is achieving ambitious climate goals in the U.S. is feasible and cost effective, since these technologies in many cases do not come at a premium and also bring benefits for health and climate. There are two implications of this trend. First is achieving ambitious climate goals in the U.S. is feasible and cost effective, since these technologies in many cases do not come at a premium and also bring benefits for health and climate. Second, there are opportunities in technology and innovation for the American economy. In expanding technological options in rooftop solar, battery storage, and electric vehicles, Tesla is just one example of the kind of clean energy business that can both innovate and generate employment. Figure 1: Cost reductions in clean energy costs since 2008 Source: US DOE https://energy.gov/revolution-now Most businesses support the Paris Agreement. The American business community, across almost all sectors, is widely in favor of continued international engagement on climate. Unlike previous eras, businesses are not “polarized” or split roughly 50-50 for or against climate policy. Instead, a small number of narrow interests (e.g., the coal industry, which employs roughly only around 0.1 percent of U.S. workers) oppose engagement against a much broader swath of the economy who support a careful U.S. policy approach and an international approach coordinated under the Paris Agreement. To make this point, large groups of American and multinational companies have organized to send messages of support for engagement. One group of 1,000 large and small companies with a market capitalization of $3.4 trillion signed a “Business Backs Low Carbon USA” letter; other groups have sent letters of support directly to Trump or have taken out advertisements publicizing their support. The companies are a “who’s who” of businesses and include Apple Inc., DuPont, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Hilton, Hewlett Packard, Intel Corp., Johnson & Johnson, Facebook, Google, Microsoft Corp., Morgan Stanley, BP, General Mills Inc., Novartis, Rio Tinto PLC, Shell, Unilever, and Walmart, to name just a few. General Electric Co. CEO Jeff Immelt has repeatedly expressed his support. As an indication of the breadth of support, American oil companies Exxon Mobile and Conoco Phillips have also argued for engaging in the Paris process. Clean energy jobs are outpacing traditional fossil jobs. A close counterpart of business engagement and clean energy costs is the potential impact of climate engagement on jobs and the economy. Recent data from the U.S. Department of Energy give a sense of relative sizes of employment. These data indicate that 3 million jobs are linked to clean energy, which includes 475,000 jobs in solar and wind energy. These are also quickly growing categories, having enjoyed growth of 25 percent and 32 percent respectively from 2015 to 2016. In contrast, coal supports about 160,000 jobs including 52,000 in mining. Natural gas and oil industries employ about 915,000 people, bioenergy about 130,000, and nuclear about 76,000. The numbers are clear in demonstrating a large segment of the U.S. energy sector moving into cleaner technologies. A majority of Americans, majority of Democrats, and majority of Republicans support Paris. Polling has shown marked growth in support for international climate action over recent years. A recent poll by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs showed a relatively strong 71 percent support for staying in Paris, with 57 percent support even for Republicans. Another study by the Yale Program on Climate Communication and the George Mason Center for Climate Communication shows 69 percent support for participating in the Paris Agreement, with 51 percent of Republicans supporting. Perhaps even more surprisingly, that study also showed that even among conservative (i.e., non-moderate) Republicans, fully 34 percent support engagement via Paris against 40 percent opposed, with the rest undecided. The polling evidence demonstrates that, as with the business community, a large portion of the American public supports engagement in climate-smart policies, and specifically an international approach under Paris. Other polling has shown that public support becomes even stronger when the health benefits of cleaner energy (avoided deaths, fewer heart and asthma conditions, lost school and workdays, etc.) are included in the overall framing of options. With even many in the Republican Party looking for solutions, continued engagement offers more opportunities for constituents to have their voices reflected and recognized in advance of upcoming elections. The flexibility of the Paris Agreement favors U.S. interests in negotiations. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt recently stated that under the Paris Agreement, China and India had no obligations until 2030 even though they were polluting more. This assertion is simply untrue (and indeed earned a full “Four Pinocchios” from the Washington Post’s Fact Checker). The reason is that the Paris Agreement was designed with the express purpose of solving this particular problem—and by including all major polluters in a common framework, the Paris Agreement includes both China and India (as well as all other key emitters) who have both opted to set emissions targets that require substantial near-term action on their part. Pruitt mounted a criticism used commonly 20 years ago—and was typically applied to bash the Kyoto Protocol. In the interim, the world listened to the critique and acted to create an international agreement that addresses these concerns. Quite simply, it’s about as good a structure as we are ever going to get in that it encourages international action while respecting that overall policies will always be set at the national level. Specifically, the new international agreement struck in Paris was expressly designed with a robust, flexible structure based on the principle of national determination and global transparency. Quite simply, it’s about as good a structure as we are ever going to get in that it encourages international action while respecting that overall policies will always be set at the national level. It therefore does not (contrary to some fears reportedly in the Trump administration) bind the U.S. to an externally imposed plan, and it does in fact provide a framework in which all countries participate and set emissions goals on an equal footing—including China and India. As such, although Secretary of Energy Rick Perry recently called for a “renegotiation” of Paris, he and the rest of the Trump administration will likely discover that there is nothing more to be gained from renegotiating. Anything the U.S. would want to do regarding our approach to climate can be done within the context of Paris. Remaining part of that process gives us the best leverage to ensure that other countries are participating on terms that the U.S. believes provide the fairest playing field and the best chance for a positive climate outcome. Withdrawing from Paris would cause severe international fallout. The science of climate change is now well known and the implications of this science are both harrowing and widely understood in countries around the world. While countries have differing approaches to the near-term strategies to reduce emissions in their own economies, both major powers and smaller countries have become concerned about the impacts of climate change on their own populations and economies. The global initiative to negotiate the Paris Agreement, which required substantial effort from many countries (not least the U.S.), is a testament to this broad support for coordinated climate action. In this light, many countries view an American pullout from Paris as an aggressive action against their own populations. Many have expressed anger and dismay that the anti-climate actions of the U.S. would make such outcomes more likely. Whether or not Trump agrees, many countries will nevertheless interpret a U.S. pullout not as simply a domestic issue but as a deliberate, unnecessary, and hostile act against their own interests. This situation creates geopolitical consequences. When many countries weigh engagement with climate heavily, a U.S. withdrawal would squander a large amount of political capital in bilateral and multilateral relations for a fleeting and inconsequential domestic political benefit. World leaders have prioritized this issue and are not sitting still. For example, when Trump called to congratulate newly elected French President Emmanuel Macron, Macron immediately used the opportunity to press Trump to keep the U.S. in the Paris Agreement. The next day, Chinese President Xi Jinping also discussed the issue with Macron and agreed to, in his words, “defend” the Paris agreement. China in particular has a great interest in portraying itself as defending developing, vulnerable countries against climate change globally, which will also support its broader efforts to cultivate favor in a number of developing countries (for example, in Africa, Asia, and Latin America) with which it is seeking greater economic and political influence. Trump has been deploying 19th century technology and 20th century political arguments in the face of a 21st century problem. In addition to these six areas of change, there is of course one more development that is important: Trump is now president with the power to shape the U.S. federal regulatory environment and international engagement. So far, when it comes to climate change, Trump has been deploying 19th century technology and 20th century political arguments in the face of a 21st century problem. The good news is that the world has already fixed the critiques that Trump administration officials have levied at the Paris Agreement. The big developing countries are also taking steps to reduce their emissions, and U.S. engagement has given us political benefits internationally. In this context, withdrawing would be a Pyrrhic victory for Trump, producing a temporary talking point, temporarily increased support from a small group of political actors in the U.S., but creating tremendous international blowback and long-term damage to U.S. interests. Moreover, and most importantly, it would slow global efforts to address the issue and make riskier and more damaging climate outcomes—to both U.S. and global interests—more likely. The rational calculus for American interests is clear, but it remains the president’s decision.

Already with 1,600 U.S. stores, Aldi’s internal studies show its prices are 21 percent lower than its lowest-priced rivals, including Wal-Mart Stores Inc WMT.N, according to Chief Executive Jason Hart. He plans to maintain that gap going forward. His strategy, previously unreported, centers on adding more private-label goods, which are a retailer's in-house brands, to win over price-sensitive customers, and a massive expansion to further disrupt a U.S. grocery sector that has seen 18 companies go bankrupt since 2014.

Online Newspaper SectionsSubscribe Crime & Courts McHenry County judge revokes bond for Woodstock man accused of sexually assaulting, kidnapping 13-year-old girl By JORDYN REILAND - jreiland@shawmedia.com12:16 am Caption Ericsson J. Gumesindo WOODSTOCK – A McHenry County judge revoked the bond for a Woodstock man, temporarily delaying his deportation, who was charged in 2014 with various sex crimes after authorities said he took a girl from her home and sexually assaulted her. Ericsson J. Gumesindo, 20, faces charges of aggravated criminal sexual assault, criminal sexual assault, residential burglary, aggravated criminal sexual abuse, aggravated kidnapping, kidnapping and possessing a stolen motor vehicle. Because police said the assault occurred while he was in possession of a stolen motor vehicle, Gumesindo faces a six-year minimum prison sentence. Gumesindo was a senior at Woodstock High School when he was charged. Woodstock police were called July 29, 2014, to the home of a 13-year-old who was reported missing. Police were taking a kidnapping report when Gumesindo drove up in a vehicle, which had been reported stolen, to drop off the heavily intoxicated girl, Assistant State’s Attorney Dave Johnston previously said in court. Two days earlier, Gumesindo’s friend let him drive a vehicle belonging to her father, and he went into Wal-Mart to secretly make a copy of the ignition key, Johnston said. Late on July 28, Gumesindo was hanging out and drinking alcohol with the 13-year-old’s older sister and another group of teenagers at her house. They were kicked out by the girls’ father, and the younger girl was put to bed but the older sister left with the group of boys, Johnston said. The 13-year-old was so intoxicated, Johnston said, that her father found her passed out in the lawn covered in vomit. As they were driving around town, Gumesindo is believed to have dropped off the group – including the older sister – on the side of the road and went back to the 13-year-old’s house, where he broke a window, cut a screen and took the girl from the home, Johnston said. Authorities believe the sexual assault happened at a nearby park when she was drifting in and out of consciousness, he said. Gumesindo’s bond was first set at $500,000, but former Judge Gordon Graham lowered his bond in August 2014 to $115,000, and he posted the 10 percent needed to be released from custody. While out of custody earlier this year, Gumesindo was picked up by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials. Prosecutors filed a motion urging Judge Michael Feetterer to revoke Gumesindo’s bond before he was deported and brought back to Mexico before his June 19 trial. Immigration officials issued an order at the end of April to start the deportation process, meaning they had 90 days to do so. Johnston said after talking with officials his office believed they planned to deport Gumesindo as soon as possible unless he was in custody somewhere else. Johnston said Gumesindo was brought to the U.S. as a child and at one time had Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals status. DACA allows certain undocumented immigrants who entered the country as minors to receive a renewable two-year period of deferred action from deportation and eligibility work permit. He said Gumesindo indicated at an immigration hearing that he did not intend to seek asylum nor did he plan to renew his DACA status at this time. Johnston said the only way Gumesindo would stay in the U.S. was if his bond was revoked until after his trial. “His legal status caught up to him while a criminal case was pending,” Johnston said. He said Feetterer should have discretion to revoke his bond because he faces deportation. Deportation status is one of the many factors considered when determining a bond amount, according to state law. Assistant State’s Attorney Randi Freese said she and Johnston fought to keep Gumesindo in McHenry County Jail custody instead of being deported so he could stand trial because “the victim deserves her day in court,” and they wanted to ensure that she had the opportunity. Gumesindo’s attorney, Francisco J. Botto, argued that the judge did not have a reason to revoke his bond because he didn’t do anything to violate the terms of his bond. Feetterer said while there was no indication of any deportation proceedings when Gumesindo’s bond was first set, a person’s legal status is a factor to consider when setting or revoking bond. “A lot of people’s lives are going to be dramatically impacted for the worse if Mr. Gumesindo is deported and no trial takes place,” Feetterer said. He also said he had a hard time understanding why federal officials don’t work together to avoid these types of situations. Gumesindo will next appear in court Tuesday.

(JWN) Stock Can Survive Retail-mageddon Chesapeake Energy Corporation (CHK) Stock Still Isn’t a Buy Bitcoin Is the Real Fear Index View All Posts Retailers that try to get traditional margins on mid-market merchandise are getting the business, and not the good kind, courtesy of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). So it is no surprise that Macy’s Inc (NYSE:M), J C Penney Company Inc (NYSE:JCP) and Kohl’s Corporation (NYSE:KSS) are barely hanging in there … but Nordstrom, Inc. (NYSE:JWN) stock should be different. Source: Shutterstock That’s because JWN sells high-end merchandise with an extremely helpful staff, acting as personal shoppers rather than clerks, whom make me look good. Well, et tu Nordstrom? The company’s same store sales fell 0.8% for the quarter ending in April and JWN stock was taken out behind the woodshed Friday, with shares opening at $43.57 after closing on May 10 at $50. As the late Jimmy Breslin wrote, quoting Casey Stengel, “Can’t anyone here play this game?” In this case, the game is retail. Why, yes. Some companies are surviving “retail-mageddon” quite well. And JWN stock actually fits into that mold. Cut Margins Costco Wholesale Corp. (NASDAQ:COST) is holding up. COST stock is up 17% in the past year. It paid a special $7 per share dividend on May 8, and it did it with wafer-thin margins, estimated at less than 13%. Costco relies on memberships for its profit, and it doesn’t even take all of it to the bottom line. Then there’s Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE:WMT), which is up over 10% so far in 2017 because it takes retail margins of just 25%. By contrast, Macy’s, like Sears Holding Corp (NASDAQ:SHLD), is in the position of hocking the family silver to stay in business. It reportedly will sell its flagship store in Chicago, and the huge store in New York’s Herald Square could be next. Companies that can’t live with low margins and sell me-too merchandise, can be replaced at a click. They have nowhere to go because we have somewhere else to go. Be Exclusive Nordstrom, is trying to get by on service and exclusivity. In today’s stock market, that’s just a way of hanging in, as Lululemon Athletica inc. (NASDAQ:LULU), now selling midway between its 2014 low and 2015 high at $54 per share, demonstrates. The difference is that all is not lost, as it seems to be for the mid-market retailers. Capital Research Global Investors recently took a position in Lululemon, which designs and sources its own merchandise, then sells it in its own stores. The stake is worth $832 million, barely one-tenth its AMZN stake, but worth noting. Ulta Beauty Inc (NASDAQ:ULTA) is also growing on exclusivity. ULTA stock is up 43% over the last year, and revenues are growing as fast as those at Amazon. Its “superstore of beauty” delivers service, not just sales, and is replacing many of the salons, spas and make-up stores that once cluttered American main streets. Nordstrom, for what it’s worth, has a similar formula for success in the new retailing environment.

The latter two companies dumped hundreds of millions into Marsh’s regional marketplace in the last two years with multiple remodels and new store construction, Marsh’s Chief Restructuring Officer Lee A. Dierks said in a disclosure statement accompanying Marsh’s Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition in Wilmington, Del., Thursday. Marsh tried to fight back by slashing costs and spending $15 million of its own on store refurbishments over the same period, Dierks said, but was unable to achieve the sales lift the company had sought. When new Kroger and Meijer stores opened, competing Marsh units saw double-digit sales declines and liquidity challenges followed shortly, he added. According to Metro Market Studies, Marsh has lost more than two percentage points of market share in its home Indianapolis market between 2013 and 2017 — before rounds of recently announced closures, falling to fourth in the market behind Kroger, Walmart and Meijer — all of which operate at least some large-scale supercenters there. Kroger’s “market fill-in” strategy — a program directing capital spending to markets where it feels it can meaningfully grow share — has been especially effective in Indianapolis, officials have remarked, citing its success there as a model for places like Wisconsin, where it is addressing the recently acquired Pick n’ Save banner.  Kroger just over two years ago said it would invest nearly half a billion dollars in the Indianapolis area on 11 new stores including seven Kroger Marketplace supercenters and 17 remodels. That investment put additional pressure on Marsh, which was also dealing with high debts and underfunded pensions, Dierks noted in the disclosure.  Pension funds Central States Southeast and Southwest (owed $6.15 million) and Marsh Supermarkets PRIAC (owned $21.7 million) are identified as the company’s two largest unsecured claimants. Marsh also owes $8 million to Supervalu, which took over its supply contract last year from C&S Whole Grocers. C&S is Marsh’s seventh largest creditor with an $800,000 claim. Marsh’s objective in bankruptcy court is to find a buyer for its remaining stores as quickly as possible, the company said, in order to avoid being forced to close the 44 “core stores” that remain open. According to Scott Moses, managing director of Peter J. Solomon Co., the company as constituted cannot afford July rents due June 25, so is aiming to be able to assume or reject those leases by June 19. Moses, whose firm was engaged by Marsh late last year to explore options, said five parties have expressed interest in some combination of the stores but a “going concern” offer has yet to have emerged. Marsh and Solomon would continue to market the assets, he said.  0 comments Hide comments Comment * More information about text formats Text format CommentsPlain text Comments Allowed HTML tags: <em> <strong> <blockquote> <br> <p> Plain text No HTML tags allowed.

Raley's workers across Sonoma County and Northern California continue to strike after thousands of workers walked off the job on the morning of Sunday, November 4. The action follows a breakdown in negotiations between leaders of UFCW-8 Golden State and UFCW Local 5 and company labor negotiators. Raley's, Nob HIll and Bel Air stores in Northern and Central California have been affected in a dispute affecting approximately 7,000 union members. Bob Tiernan, the current Raley's-Nob HIll Labor Relations Director, is the former chair of the Oregon Republican Party. The UFCW accuses Tiernan of being a "carpetbagger" who has "sold a formerly decent company a bill of goods." This is the first time in the 77-year-history of the Raley's-Nob Hill grocery chain that workers have walked out. Nearly all employees of the Rohnert Park store are on strike, with "temporary" workers taking their spots at one of the chain's oldest stores. Meat counter workers represented by the UFCW are on strike at the Santa Rosa, Windsor and Petaluma stores. Joe Colosi is a retired Raley's meat department worker. He worked for the company for 18 years. He says that they are not striking for more money, but to maintain current benefits for both retired and current employees. Raley's has proposed switching a company plan in which the store would take over the management of health and welfare benefits. In addition, the company says they can "no longer afford" to provide health coverage to retirees once they qualify for Medicare. "Our fathers started to build the company, we built the company as the baby-boomer generation, which is when they did the most growth," says Colosi. Raley's has more than $3 billion in annual sales. The company looks to be taking cues from Walmart, a multi-billion dollar company that pays its low-level workers an average of $8-$9 dollars an hour, forcing some of them to file welfare to get medical benefits, says Colosi. This past October, Walmart workers in 12 states actually went on strike for the first time in the company's history. "Raley's says the reason they need the money is to cut their expenses so they can compete," says Colosi. "But they're in a high-end grocery business. They cater to a different clientele." Mike Teel, President and CEO of Raley's (and the grandson of founder Tom Raley) posted an open letter to customers on their website, in which he writes that Raley's has been "impacted significantly by the recession and the continued expansion of other stores selling groceries." "Unfortunately, most of these stores are non-union, with lower operating costs that have made it harder for Raley's, Bel Air and Nob Hill Foods to remain competitive. As a result, our market share has suffered a significant decline. In an effort to stabilize and put us back on a growth path, we have focused on two critical areas: reducing our operating costs and improving the value we deliver our customers." Strikers say the company has more than enough profit to keep benefits as they stand. They've been handing out fliers with a photo of the Teel Family yacht, "The Ozark Lady," taken at Bay Ship in Alameda; Colosi says the yacht costs the family millions with maintenance. Becky Fernandez is 57 years old and has worked in the Raley's meat department for 13 years. She says that if the cuts to benefits go through she won't be able to retire next year as planned. "I was planning on retiring next June. If they do the takeways I cannot retire until I'm 62," says Fernandez. "I've worked a long time to get where I'm at now and it's very scary." Colosi accuses the company of taking advantage of a bad economy, as well as listening to "union-busting" attorneys that see this as a good time to break down the union. "90% of this business is goodwill," he adds, explaining how times have changed since Tom Raley, who was beloved by many employees, was in charge. "Once you lose the goodwill, it's not going to work for you too well. They've done a lot of good things, but this is the worst thing I've ever seen happen in my history with Raley's." - Note: This post has been corrected to reflect a mixup between "sales" and "profits" in a quote from Colosi.

Red Bull Content Pool Before the 32 gold and platinum records, Patrick Adams was just a Harlem kid who read the music trades, showing up regularly at theaters like The Alhambra and The Apollo, where his buddy nudged him to go sit in on piano during a rehearsal one day, kicking off his lifetime career as an arranger, engineer and producer of countless disco, soul and hip-hop classics. “So, on a particular week, say, the Motown Revue was coming in and you might have Marvin Gaye, The Supremes, and Smokey Robinson and The Four Tops,” Adams told Red Bull in 2013 of his first serious immersion in music at The Apollo. “It was such a joy to sit in the middle of that orchestra during rehearsal…I got a great education and then hearing those arrangements from inside the orchestra, that is priceless. You cannot get a better education.” A year after that, Adams was arranging music, creating a dialogue between all the genres his productions have come through. You can hear soul in his disco mixes, you can hear disco’s bounce in his Eric B. & Rakim engineering, and the connections become apparent when considering Adams’ tremendous sense of personal agency over every decision that elevated his career to the next level. His brief stint as a vice president of A&R for NY-based Perception/Today Records in 1970 led to his discovery of Black Ivory, for instance, but it also taught him he had little interest in being purely on the business end of things. Last night Red Bull gave Adams the homecoming legacy show he deserved at his beloved Alhambra Theater, featuring Adams playing alongside some of the greatest underrated disco and soul artists of his career, including Donna McGhee, Leroy Burgess, Fonda Rae and Christine Wiltshire. A few weeks prior, the Observer caught up with Adams to learn what advice he has for young artists negotiating deals, what’s changed in an era of digital streams and sample culture, and how he produced the iconic golden era hip-hop recordings of Eric B. & Rakim. How does it feel to be looking back at your eclectic career and shaping your own legacy for this show? Interestingly enough, I am discovering things about myself that I forgot! [Laughs] But it is a personal pleasure to be allowed to participate in telling the story, you know? What are you rediscovering? Well actually, two nights ago somebody posted a song on YouTube that I had done string and horn arrangements on 30 years ago. I had totally forgotten that I was involved with this particular record, the album by The Softones. They recorded for [producers] Hugo & Luigi at Acvo, at Embassy Records, I believe. R&B sort of like The Stylistics. The other thing is that a lot of the records I worked on were not commercially available over the last 20 years, like the Salsoul Orchestra Christmas album. I’m not gonna do any Christmas songs at the show, but that album, The Main Ingredient I Only Have Eyes For You album, had not been on the market. Edie Kendricks, an album called Something More had not been available. Matter of fact, Donna McGhee, who is gonna be at the concert, her album was just re-released. Patrick Albums Presents Phreak on Atlantic, which contains the song “Weekend,” that album had been re-released, too. So there’s a lot of that happening. It’s amazing how your brain works, being able to jump to all these periods with such lucidity and clarity. You’ve said before that you maybe went to the disco once because you were a record dude, because you were in the studio the whole time. Your brain might not work as well if you partied so much. Well the “disco demolition” thing, I did not experience it in real time. When it happened, in 1979, I was totally unaware of it. However, I know my income dropped from quite a substantial income to zero overnight. And when I did find out what had happened, I was dismayed. Socially, politically, what it meant in this country that a group of people could deny another group of people working because of their personal attitudes, likes and dislikes is really messed up. The same thing’s happening to rap right now, and a lot of people don’t recognize it. I don’t want to be ultra-political about it, but it is true that the way corporate structure has come to the fore in the entertainment industry, you have a handful of people deciding who is exposed, who is not exposed, and the saddest thing for me is that I don’t see a pathway for a new artist the way there was in the past. When I was 17 years old, the group I was in, The Sparks, was able to go to WBLS, WLIB, WWRL in New York, actually sit with the music director or program director and play something. You had a genius like Frankie Crocker, who programmed BLS, and if Frankie Crocker liked the record, he played it. He didn’t need an O.K. from corporate headquarters somewhere else, in another part of the country, who may have had all kinds of political and financial entanglements deciding. It also seems that in the last 10 to 15 years, payola is alive and well. I’m from Miami, and EDM was huge since I was a little kid. But because audiences have been declining at these big blowout EDM festivals, there’s been talk of the genre maybe going the way of disco. Personally, as a human being, I’ve never understood why anyone would pay 25, 30, 50 dollars to go stand in a cow pasture in the middle of nowhere and watch a guy play records. And you’re not even sure he’s playing the records! For all we know, he’s got the mix pre-programmed on a memory stick. What hurts me, as a human being again, when I think about how he’s playing a record that I made 30, 40 years ago, he’s getting paid who knows how much. Understandably, it’s a business thing: the kid draws crowds, the crowds bring money, so we’re paying him this much money. Yeah, meanwhile, I’m sitting at home getting a dollar for every 6,000 streams from the streaming services compared to back in the day, when if someone downloaded one of my songs or purchased the CD, I was getting nine cents. And there’s a big difference. “[I]n a corporation, you can do anything you want as long as you’re right.” I will tell you without giving actual figures that my royalties as a songwriter, as a publisher, are about 20 percent of what they used to be. And it’s not a function of time. Some of my songs like “In The Bush” or “Touch Me (All Night Long)” or “I’m Caught Up (In a One Night Love Affair)”, those songs are constantly being streamed and played. We can go on and on. I’ve got 400 to 500 songs recorded over the last 40 years, and those revenue streams have declined significantly in the last two years. This sounds like a conversation about how artists are often being called “content creators” now. New platforms separate a creative person from their own work. You told me a story about being at The Alhambra watching a Bill Haley movie when Chubby Checker came in to do “The Twist.” You told me about sitting in on rehearsals at The Apollo, and learning about rhythm from Smokey Robinson’s guitarist, Marv. As a New Yorker, I wonder how many places that musical conversations like that still happen in. I’m sure they do, but I go back to, what do you do after that? Where does that music live? Yeah! If you were to sit down with Sly Stone, and Sly Stone showed you his thought process of how he came up with “Dance To The Music,” or if you sat at Stevie Wonder‘s elbow for a year and became prolifically attune to his process…what do you do with it? You go from seeing your music have so much worth and value to seeing it all converted into ones and zeroes, you’re saying? Yeah, and it affects everybody. A guy who used to work at an auto plant making 40, 50 dollars an hour is now greeting people at Wal Mart. That’s the culture, it’s the time. Well you had this interesting period in the ’90s, too, when a lot of your disco hits were getting anthologized on those party mix CDs that people would buy at stores like Party City, and I reckon you have a much deeper, slow-burn history of the decline of the music industry than most people because you saw the beginning of that culture. You said from your years as a VP that you were never a business dude, and didn’t pride yourself on being one, but I reckon you had to have some sort of acumen just to make sure people weren’t screwing you over. The interesting thing is, I’ve always been one to try to study something before I jump into it. Even before I started pounding the pavement when I was 17, I was reading Billboard every week, so when I finally did get into dealing with record companies, between that and what I just call common sense…let me give you a great example. In 1977, I was approached by Cory Robins, who at the time, had just become the East Coast manager for MCA Universal publishing. They were trying to bring in more R&B writers, and he was authorized to make me an offer. That morning, I had received a publishing check from one album I had done, and what he was offering me was less than i got for this one album that had just been out! So I said to him, “I really wanna make the deal,” but I wanted a figure that was five times what he was offering me. He looked at me like I was crazy, said, “I can’t do that!” And I then started doing what I do with all people in positions like that—I said, “why not?” Either you’re gonna sit there being a gatekeeper, just do what they tell you to do and eventually get fired anyway, or take charge of the situation. I don’t even remember where the statement came from, but I quoted The Peter Principle—that in a corporation, you will rise to the level of your incompetence. The other side of that coin is, in a corporation, you can do anything you want as long as you’re right. “I would tell any young artist right now to be careful of the deals you make. I’ve always tried to tell people that if you make these deals where they can just charge things against your account like videos…O.K., we’re gonna spend a million dollars on your video, and you’re paying for that? You will never see any royalties.” Bottom lines and all that. Exactly! So if you go in the studio and spend $200,000 over a period of time, cut 10 records, and eight of them are hits, no one is going to chew you out or hate you for what you did. If you sit in your office and never make any records, or make one or two records that are flops, you’re out the door! I learned to take advantage of things. So I told Corey I wanted X amount of dollars, five times what he offered me. This was over lunch, and by the time I got back to my office and he went back to his office, he called me back to tell me they went for it. So we made our initial deal. There is a clause in almost any contract that has a royalty accounting, where the primary business is allowed to hold a reserve against future payments. Now, in the beginning of the record industry that made a lot of sense because they might ship 100,000 albums, pay the artist on 100,000 albums, then four months later only 20,000 of those albums sold and the rest were returned by distributors, then the record company is behind. So record companies were sticking this clause in that said they were allowed to retain a reasonable reserve. Only problem is, the word “reasonable” is not a legal term. I mean, what’s “reasonable” and to whom? So one of the things I learned very early is to not allow words like “reasonable” without defining them. So we would say, “O.K., you can hold a 10 percent, 20 percent reserve that I can work off over the next two royalty periods,” something like that. But the situation currently is that XYZ giant corporation would come to me now and say, “Patrick, we want to give you a label distribution deal or sign you to our label, but we want half of your publishing, we want half of any profit on your live performances, we want, we want, we want.” Then I ask why. What are they giving me? I would tell any young artist right now to be careful of the deals you make. I’ve always tried to tell people that if you make these deals where they can just charge things against your account like videos…O.K., we’re gonna spend a million dollars on your video, and you’re paying for that? You will never see any royalties. They wont charge you, but they’ll recoup until they collect it all. Yeah, and how long is that gonna take? Does that same sense of agency explain your approach to making a record? Well alright, how do you make a record? My recipe begins with a foundation based on a song, a melody and a lyric. I was tickled, the disco museum in Seattle wrote online about “I’m Caught Up (In a One Night Love Affair)” and said it would have been a great R&B record anyway, and that’s the way I feel about songs. If you start with a great song that has an attractive melody, a lyric that tells a story people can relate to, you’re way ahead of the game. If you start with a beat, which in reality is not much different than anything anybody else could contrive with Fruity Loops or other computer software, you’re just one of a million people making noise. And I don’t care how good it makes you feel—question is, why would anyone else wanna listen to this? True, there’s an emotional hook do those old Black Ivory recordings like “Don’t Turn Around”. It’s not even a song that relies on rhythm so much as the swell that follows the lyrics. And I, as a musical arranger, try to put that into every record I do. Simple formulas. You start with a great song, and as far as the record goes, you try to catch people’s attention. Outside of disco, of course, because with disco you had these long intros so the guy could mix it into another record, but the classic form of making a record to me is you try and catch people’s attention in the first 10, 15 seconds, make a statement about what it’s really about. Maybe a touch of the chorus just to say, “This song is about ugly dogs,” no offense to dog lovers. [Laughs] Then you settle on into a verse, and start to tell a story—”I saw a dog…” Is that what attracted you to Eric B. & Rakim as lyricists? I was at the time working at Power Play Studios. As usual, I didn’t really know what was happening in the outside world. You mean the cultural implications weren’t on your mind so much as the project itself? Right. So here come Eric B. & Rakim into the studio, they’re looking for a producer. I had gone from being the prince of soft soul music to the uncrowned king of disco, and I actually had an experience at that time, because I was working with Marly Marl, and someone in Marly Marl’s camp said, “Fuck Patrick Adams. He’s a disco producer, he can’t make rap records.” And that was a challenge. Yeah. Here we go again! So I said, “I’m not gonna take a prominent front row in this rap thing, I’m just gonna make the records.” I told Eric B. & Rakim, “I’ll help you produce the records, but you guys take the blame or the credit.” [Laughs] And I will tell you, it only took two seconds to recognize the extreme talent that Rakim had, not only as a performer, but as a writer. George Carlin would always talk about orgasm taste or orgasm hearing…put yourself in a situation where you’re sitting in a recording studio, one o’clock in the morning, and Rakim for the first time is recording a new lyric. You’re being assaulted with these amazing, amazing rhymes. I would just sit there and say, “wow.” “At the time, when people made rap records, they were just grabbing samples from different places and throwing them together. A lot of the times those samples, those parts from different records, were not in relevant keys. It actually hurt my ears.” Now, one of the things I’m very proud of, and it means nothing to anyone else in the world, is that I read an interview with Paul McCartney somewhere around 1987, and they asked him what he was listening to at the time. He said, “I really like Eric B. & Rakim,” and that blew me away. But I also understood why he liked them. At the time, when people made rap records, they were just grabbing samples from different places and throwing them together. A lot of the times those samples, those parts from different records, were not in relevant keys. It actually hurt my ears. A lot of non-musical people don’t realize that a beat has a key to it. But then to also make sure that, if you’re using a bass loop or playing a bass line, that you’re playing it so the whole thing is musical. If the bass is playing in the key of C and the horn is playing in the key of D, that just hurts the ear. It hurts the body! So I tried to bring a musicality to what we did, and I think that’s one of the reasons why people were attracted to those albums, aside from the tremendous talent that Rakim showed. It was an environment where he could shine, because you weren’t fighting through this dissonant music to understand what he was doing. It all flowed. And then sound-wise, once again, McCartney was listening to himself, in a sense. One of the things I grew up listening to was The Beatles, and even today, those records sound so good. Well they were studio cats like you after what, ’66? They decided to put all their creativity into making perfect records that would last forever. Yeah, that’s what records are! I feel sorry for people who grew up listening to .MP3 files. If someone wants to really experience music and what it could sound like, they should seek out some of those direct-to-disc recordings, like the Thelma Houston album, I think it’s Ready To Roll. What they did was, they set up the whole orchestra in the studio, background singers, everybody, and they rehearsed the songs until they were perfect. Then, instead of recording to a multi-track that would later be mixed then mastered from a mixtape, they recorded directly from the console, into the master. So as they were recording, the vinyl that would later press the vinyl was being carved out in real time, as they were recording. So you lost nothing in the translation. When you do the process the other way, every time you re-record something, you do a mix or a transfer, you lose something. Room noise, overtones get lost in the compression. And that’s the other thing. I’m really happy that Power Point Studios became the in studio in the late ’80s, early ’90s, because any time an engineer would figure something out, we would tell each other. Little secret I learned from Tony Bongiovi, using light compression at the recording stage, we used to do that with everything. So we had maybe a B-class studio sounding like a world class studio because the sounds that were coming out sounded so much larger than life. You’re saying you compressed with discretion early on instead of all over the place at the end? Yeah, and that was another thing about the Paid in Full album. When you listen to the album carefully, in the stereo image, there’s a 22 millisecond delay on the right side reflecting things from the left and a 22 millisecond delay on the left reflecting things from the right. Like I said, because I grew up with live musicians for most of my youth, when we come to the rap era and you take a drum sample out of a machine and it sounds horrible, to my ears, they sound horrible because they were often over-compressed, flat, and that’s not the way drums really sound. So I decided I would use a slight room delay on the drums. I’m telling you, listen to Paid in Full and it sounds huge. Patrick Adams, center, surrounded by admirers and acolytes last night at Red Bull Music Academy’s celebration of Adams’ music. Red Bull Content Pool Less than 10 years after, your music pops up on Raekwon’s record. I had no personal involvement. I’ve been blessed because I catch at least one sample a year, like last year Mac Miller did a song called “Brand Name,” sampled one of my songs. Before that was Mariah Carey, “You Don’t Know What To Do” sampled “Caught Up,” year before that it was Nas. You’re on God’s Son, too. I’m on God’s Son. “Revolutionary Warfare” sampled “We Made It” by Black Ivory. Matter of fact, Black Ivory’s been sampled about 30, 40 times. Thank God for some honest people, but there have been people who’ve sampled some of my things, and if you’re really, really good at snatching pieces of stuff, the originator might never recognize what you nabbed. So there’s been situations, like to this day, Nas, with “Daughters,” I can’t still figure out exactly what he sampled to this day. But the fact that he was nominated for four Grammys, I accept that, I’m happy. Thing is, I knew about that record three, four months before it was released because Nas is an honorable person. Nas and his people sought out commissions, et cetera. Meanwhile, there’s been other records where I’m sitting at home and suddenly hear something and say, “Wait a minute…” Did Kanye hit you up about that Kay-Gees sample? No! And there’s going to be some repercussions from that shortly.

Yep, “Harry Styles” is that rare generation-spanning, forward-thinking retro album, one that nods to the past without garishly repeating it, apart from an occasional self-aware wink: Think Amy Winehouse, Justin Timberlake, and of course Adele, although he doesn’t sound much like any of them apart from the Adelesque grandiosity of the lead single, “Sign of the Times.” But let’s not get into any premature “Next Adele” fever-dreams just yet. While the album doesn’t sound out of time, there’s really not much to place it in 2017: It’s loaded with acoustic guitars and has nary a trap beat, drop or apparently even an electronic drum. It even feels like an old-school vinyl album: In an era when many long-players have 18 songs and hover around the 70-minute mark, this one’s got an even 10 tracks and clocks in at 40 minutes, without feeling skimpy. It’s even, at least subconsciously, divided into sides: the softer side one and the rockier side two, which kicks off with the hard-riffing “Only Angel” (hell, the song’s even got a cowbell) and roars into the even ballsier “Kiwi” before downshifting for the final three tracks. But despite the guitars and the hype about how “rock” “Harry Styles” is, it’s miles away from the Rolling Stones or even the sweeping rock anthems purveyed by two of this album’s patron saints, David Bowie and Queen. Instead, their influence is heard more in the cinematic sweep of the ballads, along with dashes of Elton John, Fleetwood Mac, Nilsson (the arrangement on this album’s lead single, “Sign of the Times,” is more than a little reminiscent of his 1973 hit “Without You”; “Carolina” has some of his quirky charm) and even Badfinger — the guitar line in “Ever Since New York,” which is lifted almost directly from that group’s 1972 power-pop chestnut “Baby Blue,” surely is no accident. Related Harry Styles’ Solo Album: A Track-by-Track Breakdown The primary sonic architects here are executive producer Jeff Bhasker (Fun, Kanye West, Beyonce, Mark Ronson’s “Uptown Funk”) and two of his longtime associates, who bring even more diversity: co-producer/guitarist Alex Salibian worked with Young the Giant, country singer Cam and big-voiced pop thrush Elle King; co-producer Tyler Johnson’s studio pedigree includes OneRepublic and Ed Sheeran, and he wrote songs with or for Cam, Keith Urban, Miley Cyrus and John Legend. Yet that’s not to downplay the decisive mark Styles makes here: He co-wrote every song, played guitar and performed all of the vocals on several (check out his impressive stacked harmonies on “From the Dining Table”), and makes his mark as a strong and distinctive lead singer. And there’s no question whose album this is: You never think for a second that he’s not doing exactly what he wants, as far as it may place him from the teen-pop realm that made him a superstar. And while there are definitely hits on the album — “Sign of the Times” reached No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 — there’s nothing you’d exactly call a “banger.” In fact, the most likely second single from the album, the acoustic lilt “Two Ghosts,” is closer to contemporary country than pop radio (and not just because it’s supposedly about his ex, Taylor Swift). Related Harry Styles ‘Behind the Album’ Documentary Gets Release Date on Apple Music So the big question here is where this leaves Styles’ millions of young fans. The rapturous critical response and receptive ears in later generations thus far speak to the album’s quality and generation-spanning appeal (and it’s safe to say that Eagles manager Irving Azoff, father and partner of Styles’ manager Jeffrey Azoff, knows how to market to an older audience). But will the kids come along? Will “Harry Styles” be the summer soundtrack for bonding moments between rebellious teens and their parents, or will the kids feel he’s abandoned them? Indeed, he sings “I’ve never felt less cool” on the closer, “From the Dining Table.” Time will tell. But either way, Styles has made a bold and brave statement of intent that completely reinvents him as an artist — and leaves a wide-open road for whatever he might want to do next.

The first three days were restricted to vendors and the business community. “It’s where stores like Target and Walmart come to review products and buy new things,” said JPMA Executive Director Kelly Mariotti. “By putting a consumer event along with our trade events, the moms and dads will get to see a full line from the manufacturers,” Mariotti said. “They see things that aren’t even on the market yet.”   Some new items have already received industry buzz, including: –The Grab-and-Go Booster seat by mifold. The seat for kids age 4 and up folds small enough to fit into a purse. ($40) –The Pop, a pacifier that pops into a protective bubble when it hits a surface, keeping it clean; ($10) –Self-Installing Car Seat by 4moms. The car seat levels itself for correct installation ($500) –The Happiest Baby SNOO, a baby bed that responds to a child’s crying with womb-like motion. ($1,200) Got a case of sticker shock? Americans spend an estimated $12,000 on their newborns in the first year, which adds up to some $23 billion spent annually in the U.S. on diapers and accessories, according to the USDA. Never fear, parents, the expo will have plenty of cost-conscience items as well. “People have really been working on price point. Even the new products are accessible to most families,” Mariotti said. The Anaheim event will feature 300 exhibitors focusing on “functional products, things that help make parent’s lives easier,” according to Mariotti. If you can’t make the Anaheim event, JPM will host another show Nov. 5-6 in Los Angeles. “We had such a great response in L.A. last fall and we had such a great reception from the Orange County community. When we’re looking at consumers and parents and families, this is a great place to engage with them,” Mariotti said. Anaheim Baby Show May 13, 2017 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Anaheim Convention Center $30 for a family ticket (up to two parents and four children), $20 for an individual ticket Tickets can be bought at AnaheimBabyShow.com.

Valarie Honeycutt Spears & Fayette County Public Schools vhoneycutt@herald-leader.com Education May 12, 2017 2:04 PM Fish tanks, a cafe and chairs from Walmart part of students’ pitch for library redesign By Valarie Honeycutt Spears vhoneycutt@herald-leader.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story If students have their way, Lexington’s Henry Clay High School could have a renovated library with dry erase tables, mobile shelves, a powerball-shaped charging station for cellular phones, fish tanks, a giant white board, a small cafe and maybe even some chairs from Walmart. Sarah Zehnder’s Advanced Geometry class of ninth and tenth graders has designed several proposals for a library renovation that could be scheduled within the next three years. They pitched them Thursday. Students are using the skills they learned in geometry to make a scale drawing, draft a budget, do cost calculations by hand and create a power point presentation, said Zehnder. They visited libraries and researched the latest furniture trends. Most of their cost proposals ranged from $50,000 to a few hundred thousand dollars. Parker Clarke said he and classmate Nolan Doss “were just trying to show that we can turn a library that has been here for many years into something more modern, and put more modern technology, more modern furniture into it. We can do it on our budget .. we can do it with students’ thinking.” Parker was among the students who lobbied for new computers, calling the current ones “a dinosaur.” Teachers at the school will cast votes for the plans students presented and the winner is exempt from the class final exam. School officials say they expect to see elements of the students’ ideas in the ultimate library renovation, which is on the district’s four-year plan of construction projects. The entire school renovation could cost $17.3 million, according to the plan. Students think that “all bits and pieces put together would make a really nice design,” said Zehnder. A team that included Audrey Glockner suggested dry erase tables, mobile shelving, IPad minis and fishtanks at a cost of $160,000. “We were hoping to make the library more of a fun place,” Audrey said. Hannah Miller suggested a giant white board — she was inspired by the movie “Hidden Figures’ — so that students could work on problems together. She also suggested a mobile charging station called The Powerball, that looks like a lottery Power Ball. Hannah also thinks the new library should be painted light blue. Light blue paint is proven to spark productivity in students and help with keeping them focused and calm, she said. Emma Gray thought the addition of a cafe costing around $760 and offering coffee and other drinks would help students wake up in the morning. Another group found some chairs at Walmart they thought would be serviceable. Fayette County Superintendent Manny Caulk sat in on some of the presentations Thursday. “Our students are young designers using geometry to reimagine, to make the space better,” Caulk said. “I think they’ve done an outstanding job,” said Librarian Felica White. “There are bits and pieces from each proposal that potentially could add to this space.” Grant Dolen presented a 3D model of his plan, which included a proposal for a second level in the library. “This isn’t the worst library, but it isn’t the best,” Grant said. “I know it could be so much better.” Valarie Honeycutt Spears: 859-231-3409, @vhspears Grant Dolan used a 3D model he made to show a two-story design of the library with a spiral staircase at Henry Clay High School in Lexington.

Empty boxes sit in stacks at the Jet.com Inc. fulfillment center in Kansas City, Kansas. [Photo: Daniel Acker/Bloomberg via Getty Images] By Ruth Reader4 minute Read The first thing you notice on entering Story, a retail concept store in Manhattan’s trendy Chelsea arts district, is that it’s full of fake grass. The stuff even accents the plywood tables, which are laid out with carefully curated items including $8 tarragon lip balm, Jonathan Adler copper finished candles, Public Supply notebooks, a sous vide machine, myriad cookbooks from Food52, and a beach cooler with a blending attachment and frisbee holder. advertisement This space is updated to accomodate a new theme or partner every few months, and starting this week it’s a collaboration with the discount online retailer Jet.com, which Walmart acquired for $3.3 billion last year. But despite what some reports may have led you to believe–CNBC called it a “temporary brick-and-mortar grocery location,” Mashable touted it as an “artisanal grocery,” and Business Insider claimed it’s “now selling some of its products IRL“–this is not anywhere near an attempt by Jet to start selling at retail. You can’t even buy the groceries. It is, however, a marketing stunt that offers insight into the way Jet is thinking about competing with Amazon Fresh through its deliver-to your-door grocery service. Mixed into those delightful tables full of knickknacks are glass and ceramic containers brimming with fruits and vegetables: mini zucchinis, sunset colored grape tomatoes, avocados, red onions, and some small slightly blemished lemons. Each one wore a circular sticker bearing Jet’s logo: a “j” with a second tittle mirroring the dot atop Jet’s lowercase j that forms a sort of half-smiling face.

Deets ????go.jet.com/jetfreshstory and the link in our bio! A post shared by Jet (@jet) on May 10, 2017 at 12:06pm PDT “We put those on there,” an attendant at the store explained to me. She also said the merchandise in the store isn’t sold on Jet, but it turns out that you can indeed buy all of this food and many of the products from Jet and have it delivered to your door. But you cannot buy it in the store (the attendant did, however, encourage me to take whatever I wanted, and I promptly pocketed an avocado). Other than that, Jet’s presence in the store is minimal, mostly represented by a mural in the back of the store composed of purple Jet boxes and a silver fridge full of fresh produce organized by color. Jet’s presence here is a far cry from Amazon’s data-driven bookstore reinvention, where books are curated according to popularity and displayed face front. Neither is it reminiscent of Amazon’s drive-through grocery pickup locations. Rather, the Story partnership is curated around a set of events. Local lettuce goddess Gotham Greens, which sells its leafy vegetables on Jet, is hosting a trunk show. Bobbi Brown and Refinery 29 are giving a talk about fresh food as a tool for beauty inside and out (no doubt coconut oil will make an appearance). Mario Batali will divulge secret recipes (and you can buy orange crocs with his signature molded into the shoe’s strap at Story). The ingredients discussed at all these events can be retrieved online through Jet.com. advertisement But you still can’t buy them at the Story shop. And that’s because Jet has no interest in physical retail. “We are part of the world’s largest retailer from a brick and mortar stand point,” says Jet president Liza Landsman. “I don’t see any reason why we would build stand-alone Jet retail stores.” Right now, Jet’s goal is to increase loyalty and attract new customers. Sitting in this cross section of camera-slung tourists and well-to-do Manhattanites Jet hopes to help passerby and Story frequenters to discover new recipes, cool brands, a $50 gold farfalle-shaped keychain, and perhaps its grocery delivery service. This installation is part of a wider trend among e-commerce brands that are dabbling in glass-front stores. They are, at root, very fancy billboards. Everlane has a showroom and “retail experiment” where you can look at new collections and try them on, but you can’t take them home–you’ll have to order online and have your purchases shipped. Away opened a boutique in New York that sells both its collection of travel gear as well as complementary products from other brands. Cuyana has three locations and only one is actually designated as a store (it has a pop-up in Boston and a showroom in San Francisco). The two players with the largest spread of stores, Warby Parker and Bonobos, don’t actually let you take merchandise home. That’s because these locations, which are unlikely to grow to the size of traditional retail outlets like Gap Inc. with its 3,700 global storefronts, are touch points. They are opportunities for consumers to discover and interact with product that ordinarily is untouchable without a purchase. Jet’s lightly branded store and supplemental talks and demonstrations is an extension of this same idea; it’s a mechanism for getting its existing customer base to associate fresh produce with its online store, rather than just toilet paper and shampoo. I’m not convinced that this marketing pitch will pay off in the form of new customers, but you can decide for yourself: The events taking place at Story for the duration of Jet’s stay will either be live-streamed or posted on Jet’s site. So even if foot traffic on 10th avenue is slow, or Story’s events fail to connect real-life patrons with Jet’s online market, eternal online content might just convince someone in some other city far, far away to buy up ingredients for a soothing coconut oil mask. Correction: An earlier version of this story referred to Jet.com’s collaboration with Story as a pop-up shop and “would-be storefront,” which is not entirely accurate, and failed to note that Jet.com sells some of the products as well as the food. The story has been updated to reflect these changes. About the author Ruth Reader is a writer for Fast Company who covers gig economy platforms, contract workers, and the future of jobs.

(Photo: Gage Skidmore/flickr/cc) Tough Guy Attorney General Jeff Session has announced that federal prosecutors will charge low-level drug offenders and others with the most serious crimes possible, despite overwhelming evidence and a bipartisan agreement that this approach is racially discriminatory and counterproductive. "The Sessions approach will throw thousands of people – especially Americans from communities of color or with low-incomes – into prison needlessly, sabotaging their life chances and increase post-release criminality. It is shameful and stupid." The Sessions approach will throw thousands of people – especially Americans from communities of color or with low-incomes – into prison needlessly, sabotaging their life chances and increase post-release criminality. It is shameful and stupid. Shameful because there is overwhelming empirical evidence that this approach unfairly targets and damages young people of color. And stupid because there is, equally, overwhelming empirical evidence that it will create a cycle of crime. At the same time that Sessions is announcing a clampdown on nonviolent, low-level offenders, Session’s Department of Justice is expected to announce resolution of a longstanding major corporate crime case: allegations of a massive Wal-Mart bribery scheme in Mexico and perhaps other countries. If news reports of the settlement are accurate, the settlement will involve a slap-on-the-wrist fine; no individual prosecutions; and a non-prosecution agreement with the Wal-Mart company, in which the company avoids prosecution in exchange for a promise not to break the law in the future – a meaningless commitment since the company is required to follow the law with or without an agreement with the Department of Justice. "It appears Tough Guy Attorney General Sessions is only tough on the poor and vulnerable." So, it appears Tough Guy Attorney General Sessions is only tough on the poor and vulnerable. (That conclusion comports with Sessions’ performance as Alabama attorney general, as we explained in a January report on Sessions’ tenure in that post.) When it comes to the rich, powerful and connected, it seems that Sessions is soft on crime. This is a moral and policy disgrace. The moral element should be self-evident. From a policy point of view, corporate crime and wrongdoing inflicts far more harm on society than street crime, as horrific as the toll of street crime is. And the corporate criminal class is likely to be far more responsive to the deterrent effect of harsh penalties – as well as far more likely to break the law if violations are prosecuted lightly or not at all – than street criminals.

The reasons are well documented, with internet sales being the prime culprit, as purchases have soared in recent years. One thing is for sure, if you want to invest in the sector, you better stay with the proven winners. In a series of new research reports from Jefferies, while staying cautious on most of the sector, they are also raising estimates on some of the top companies. The analysts are focused on the stronger areas of the retail sector like the discounters and home improvement, and while the estimate increases are not huge, they are far better than most of the industry. Dollar Tree This bargain retailer bounced off a triple bottom low in March and could be offering a very compelling entry point. Dollar Tree Inc. (NASDAQ: DLTR) is a leading operator of single-price point dollar stores under the Dollar Tree banner, along with multi-price points under the Deal$ banner, with over 13,800 locations in the United States and Canada. The company completed the purchase of competitor Family Dollar in 2015 to become the largest domestic dollar store retailer. Jefferies is somewhat positive on the company and raised its comparable sales estimates to 2.0% from 1.5%. The analyst noted this in the research report: Our total enterprise comp store sales increased to 1.5% from 1.2%. In addition to our national checks, our local Dollar Tree checks showed good sell through for seasonal items, which should be good for margins. Based on store level checks, it does not sound like there are any notable Family Dollar integration issues that are disrupting store operations in any way. Jefferies rates the stock at Hold and has an $80 price target. The Wall Street consensus target is $89.43. The shares closed Thursday at $81.49. Home Depot This company remains the undisputed leader in the home improvement retail category. Home Depot Inc. (NYSE: HD) is the world’s largest home improvement specialty retailer, with 2,270 retail stores in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, 10 Canadian provinces and Mexico. Home Depot stores sell various building materials, home improvement products, and lawn and garden products, as well as provide installation, home maintenance and professional service programs to do-it-yourself (DIY), do-it-for-me (DIFM) and professional customers. Jefferies, like many on Wall Street, remains very positive on the company as home improvement spending remains much stronger than most retail areas of spending. The firm raised the U.S. comparable same-store-sales outlook to 5.5% from 4.5%, and overall comparable sales to 5.2% from 4.2%. It also raised fiscal first-quarter earnings estimates. The report noted this: We believe Home Depot continued to take share in the first quarter and it remains our preferred way to play the reversion to the mean in home improvement spending. The industry is lapping the toughest quarterly comparison of the year, led by a strong February last year. However, trends remain strong as quarter-to-date building materials, hardware and garden supply sales (according to government figures) have grown 6.4% year-over-year while lapping a 10.1% growth over the same time period last year. Home Depot investors are paid a 2.28% dividend. The $182 Jefferies price target is well above the consensus price objective of $160.29. The shares close most recently at $156.20. Wal-Mart The giant retailer has done very well since bouncing off lows for the year in January. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE: WMT) operates retail stores in various formats worldwide, including discount stores, supermarkets, supercenters, hypermarkets, warehouse clubs, cash and carry stores, home improvement stores, specialty electronics stores, restaurants, apparel stores, drug stores and convenience stores. It also operates via retail websites, such as Walmart.com and SamsClub.com. Each week, nearly 260 million customers and members visit the company’s 11,535 stores under 72 banners in 28 countries and e-commerce websites in 11 countries. With fiscal year 2016 revenue of $482.1 billion, Wal-Mart employs approximately 2.2 million associates worldwide. The Jefferies analysts raised the same-store-sales numbers to 1.5% from 1.0%. They conducted some national field checks on the retail giant and said: Several of the store managers we spoke to highlighted price investment in food and apparel. We are modelling modest gross margin decline as it continues to execute its price investment campaign. Pricing surveys included in this report showed a continued widening of gaps with key competitors. Food deflation should be less of a headwind and could shift to modest inflation in the second half of the year. Currency continues to be a headwind and could remain that way the next couple of quarters, given current levels. Shareholders receive a 2.68% dividend. Jefferies rates the stock a Buy and raised the price target to $88. That compares with a consensus price objective of $74.90. Shares closed above that level Thursday at $76.13.

Faced with declining same-store sales in recent years, Whole Foods is transforming itself into a supermarket with lower costs and prices. That’s likely to be a boon for customers who have been enticed away from the high-end organic grocer by cheaper competitors like Trader Joe’s and Kroger, where prices on comparable products are as much as 15 percent lower. Indeed, Kroger has overtaken the high-end organic grocer as the largest seller of organic and natural food in America. “There’s a lot of pricing pressure because their customers can get the same type of healthy food at lower costs at places like Walmart,” says Michelle Grant, head of retailing research at Euromonitor. Most immediately, this means price cuts for frozen food and milk and butter are coming your way. In a recent conference call with stock analysts, Whole Foods execs said that they had been testing price reductions in the former category with “really great results.” It’s also launching a pilot program this summer to cut costs — and price tags — of dairy products. Clients who have stuck with Whole Foods through an era of high prices are also going to be the first to benefit from the launch of its long-awaited loyalty program. Whole Foods has been testing a customer rewards card for some years now — over 200,000 customers currently participate — and the execs said that it would roll the scheme out nationwide by the end of this year. The grocer wouldn’t disclose specifics on the affinity scheme, but analysts expect it to be simple. Instead of requiring customers to save digital coupons, like Target’s Cartwheel app, or accumulate points, like CVS’ Extra Care program, Whole Foods will likely just offer direct discounts to those enrolled in the loyalty program. Finally, customers who have lunch or drinks at one of Whole Food’s in-store cafes and bars may soon have to share tables with larger crowds drawn by lower restaurant prices. Partly in response to shareholder pressure, Whole Foods added five new directors to its board this week, including Panera Bread Co. founder and chief executive Ron Shaich. Some experts think that he’ll be asked to help the executive team build more “retailtainment” options. “Panera is a midmarket brand that understands that consumer base and what they’ll pay for,” says Grant. “That’s different from the high-end crowd that Whole Foods already draws.” Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy Filed under consumers ,  trader joe's ,  walmart ,  whole foods Share this article: Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy Read Next Credit card fraud alerts are on the rise — save yourself Read Next Credit card fraud alerts are on the rise — save yourself Share Selection Trending Now on NYPost.com 40,101 Teen found hanged with ‘I hate my brother’ written on her arm 26,813 Beth Stern: 'Everything is great' with Howard 17,283 Video shows brutal bullying at school days before 8-year-old's suicide Now On Carolina Herrera’s nephew killed in Venezuela New lawsuit claims Fyre Festival was fraud from the start Michelle Pfeiffer hung out in Ruth Madoff’s kitchen to prep for role SEE ALL Video Here are 7 surprising things you didn’t know about Howard Stern Now On The 10 Best Erotic Thrillers on Netflix SEE ALL More Stories page six Beth Stern: 'Everything is great' with Howard Now On Decider Nicole Kidman Spits Out Chef Giada De Laurentiis’ Food During Contentious Cooking Segment nypost Teen found hanged with ‘I hate my brother’ written on her arm New York Post Facebook Twitter Instagram LinkedIn Email Email Newsletters Mobile Apps Contact Us Tips Facebook Twitter Instagram LinkedIn Email Sections & Features News Real Estate Page Six Tech Sports Media Metro Photos Entertainment Video Business Alexa Opinion Covers Fashion Horoscopes Living Classifieds Newsletters & Feeds Email Newsletters RSS Feeds NYPost Store Home Delivery Subscribe Manage Subscription Preferences Help/Support Customer Service App FAQ & Help Contact Us Tips Newsroom Letters to the Editor Reprints Careers Apps iPhone App iPad App Android Phone Android Tablet Advertise Media Kit Contact Post Digital Network © 2017 NYP Holdings, Inc.

A damning investigative report by the Washington Post sheds some light on an industry that’s massive, lucrative, and, if the report is anything to go by, underhanded. In 2016, a Post reporter visited a Greeley-based production facility belonging to Aurora Organic Dairy, a Colorado company that supplies organic milk to grocery chains like WalMart and Costco. During his eight-day visit, he noticed a few things about the way the production facility was managing its day-to-day operations. For one, the reporter claimed that no more than a few hundred cows—out of the facility’s 15,000—were grazing in the pastures at any given time. According to the guidelines set in place by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), cows that are organically-certified must be allowed to graze no less than 120 days in a calendar year. In another instance, the reporter had Virginia Tech scientists test the chemical makeup of Aurora organic milk. The results showed that the so-called “organic” milk was similar to conventional milk. Another rule from the “Guidelines for Organic Certification of Dairy Livestock” dictates that organic cows must be fed grains and forages that contain no antibiotics, GMO-derived products, synthetic preservatives, and animal by-products. Conventional dairy cows are not required to comply with these standards, and it shows in the milk these cows produce. Milk from conventional, grass-fed cows contains elevated levels of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) and alpha-linolenic acid; by contrast, other milk substances like linoleic acid tend to be at lower levels. The tests conducted by the Virginia Tech scientists revealed that Aurora Organic Dairy’s milk had CLA and linoleic acid levels that were on par with conventional milk. Although the alpha-linolenic was higher than conventional milk, it still ranked below what could be considered “USDA Organic”. Moreover, it was discovered that the USDA allows dairy farmers to hire their own inspectors. The USDA is not obligated to inspect farms like Aurora Organic Dairy; instead, they provide a list of licensed, private companies from which farmers can select inspectors. The inspectors that the farms hire don’t visit the farms spontaneously, however. According to the report, a mere five percent of inspections are impromptu while the rest are arranged days or even weeks in advance. Furthermore, inspections sent to the USDA are reviewed every two-and-a-half years on average. The inspectors that were recently hired by Aurora Organic Dairy revealed that they were unsure about how much time the cows spent grazing, because they performed their annual audit well after grazing season had ended. When contacted by FoxNews.com about the report, Aurora Organic Dairy’s director of communications, Sonja Tuitele, responded: “We are an 100 percent organic company and have always produced great tasting, high-quality certified organic milk throughout our history. We take extraordinary care of our animals, and we meet or exceed the requirements of the USDA National Organic Program. We completely reject the suggestion that organic compliance can be determined by a test, and so does organic certification. Certification is the only test for organic compliance.” Aurora Organic Dairy came under scrutiny from the USDA in the past. In 2007, the USDA considered removing Aurora Organic Dairy’s “organic” status after their organic practices were called into question. The case was eventually resolved several months later, with the company vowing to make the necessary improvements to allow the continuation of their operations.

By Gary Sernovitz   May 12, 2017 In the United States and Saudi Arabia, unelected men in their thirties have swiftly amassed power.CreditPHOTOGRAPH BY BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI / AFP / GETTY When Donald Trump travels to Saudi Arabia later this month, the first country he will visit as President, the attention will be on geopolitics and the complicated friendship between Saudi Arabia and the United States. But the trip also highlights, just off center stage, an unremarked upon similarity between the current Saudi government and the American White House: in both places, unelected men in their thirties have swiftly amassed power. In Saudi Arabia, the thirty-one-year-old Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the deputy Crown Prince and son of King Salman, is now in charge of the oil industry, the economy, defense policy, a war in Yemen, and various domestic initiatives. In the United States, the national responsibilities of Jared Kushner, the President’s thirty-six-year-old son-in-law, include, according to the Times, “Middle East peace, the opioid epidemic, relations with China and Mexico, and reorganizing the federal government from top to bottom.” Kushner is technically the President’s senior adviser, but you might also call him America’s crown prince. The most striking similarity between the rise of Kushner and that of Prince bin Salman is that, in both countries, the official narrative is that the young men are bringing modern and advanced ideas into stodgy government terrain. The older rulers—a seventy-year-old President and an eighty-one-year-old King—seem to be making the case that the princes have earned their broad portfolios by being in touch with the latest in finance and technology. This may be sincere. It may also be a ploy to mask that the young men gained their status through the oldest of means: family ties and court intrigues. Neither distinguished himself in a tech career before taking on his current duties. Kushner helped run his family’s real-estate business; bin Salman did a tour in Saudi government posts before going to work at his father’s foundation. But the narrative of technological savvy resonates—and seems almost natural—because it connects with the predominant view of success and power in our era. Had the princes lived in the age of Napoleon or Alexander, they would be lauded for their military élan. But they live in the age of boy geniuses—of Mark Zuckerberg, Sergey Brin, Larry Page, and Elon Musk. And so the crown princes are presented as tech disruptors. As consumers, we not only use the boy geniuses’ products and services, we celebrate their ethos: the young have the best ideas, inefficiency is the enemy, disruption is the goal, change is good; faster is always better, the physical will bend before the digital, and resisters just don’t get it. We also celebrate the boy geniuses as people. (You can probably name the C.E.O. of Uber but likely not the leaders of Walmart, Chevron, or Coke.) So it’s not surprising that the boy geniuses would be proposed as peers and role models for Prince bin Salman and Kushner. As Politico reported, “Kushner’s boosters see him as ‘a visionary’ who is bringing to government a disruptive Silicon Valley mindset that helped him succeed in the technology and real estate industries, as well as on Trump’s unconventional presidential campaign.” Kushner’s efforts center on the still-evolving role of the Office of American Innovation. According to the Washington Post, the office has “a particular focus on technology and data” and will function as a “SWAT team of strategic consultants … staffed by former business executives.” It has already sought the advice of Bill Gates, Musk, and other tech leaders. Kushner will presumably continue to consult with and apply lessons from his brother, a venture capitalist in tech. The goal of the Office of American Innovation could have come from any Silicon Valley disruptor: “To bring a creative and strategic approach to many critical issues and intractable problems,” as Kushner put it in a White House press release. Prince bin Salman’s goal is even larger: the transformation of a government, economy, and society. He’s also using the language and symbols of the boy geniuses. Last year, for instance, he and Zuckerberg were photographed together at Facebook’s headquarters, color-coördinated, both wearing designer jeans (although the deputy Crown Prince wore a white button-down shirt and a gray jacket, not the Full Zuck gray T-shirt). The centerpiece of Prince bin Salman’s plan is the complicated, multi-faceted Vision 2030, a plan developed in conjunction with consultants at McKinsey. The heart of this vision for a better Saudi Arabia is not, alas, democracy; it’s an I.P.O. The engine of Vision 2030 is to use the proceeds of the I.P.O. of Saudi Aramco, the state oil company, to feed the largest state investment fund in the world. That fund will finance investments “in large international companies and emerging technologies from around the world” and non-oil industries in Saudi Arabia, which will (according to the plan) reduce Saudi oil dependency and ignite changes in the country. The narrative of bin Salman as a benevolent disruptor has been undercut now and then by his behavior. Last year, he bought a half-billion-dollar yacht on a whim, while cutting benefits and salaries to Saudi state employees and reducing energy subsidies for the country’s citizens. Kushner, too, appears to spend a fair amount of time skiing rather than solving today’s most intractable problems. And both men often seem enamored by the alchemical ability of capital to render their fortunes more glamorous in the eyes of the global élite. Even before his father-in-law became President, Kushner was in the process of mutating some of his own family’s wealth—built on vast holdings of apartment buildings in New Jersey—into the New York Observer and the most expensive office building ever bought in Manhattan. (A decade later, the deal is in trouble, presenting a tempting opportunity for those seeking to curry favor with Kushner and, through him, Trump.) Prince bin Salman, too, sometimes appears like a grandson embarrassed by the source of his grandfather’s fortune, trying to convert it into something that plays better in London and New York. Under his reign, the first high-profile investment of Saudi’s Public Investment Fund was a $3.5-billion stake in Uber, an investment that seems unlikely to change Saudi society. Nonetheless, the men also seem sincere in their desires to use innovation to achieve good ends. And we should probably root for their success. If a more efficient government better serves American citizens, Kushner’s success would be good for everyone. Innovation has already brought us wealth and improvements in everyday life. (President Obama, too, spoke warmly of Silicon Valley innovation.) And Saudi Arabia—with a rising youth population and sectarian tensions, a suppressed civil society, and a ruling family whose oil wealth is being challenged by U.S. shale production and non-fossil-fuel consumption—seems precariously unstable, in a region that exports instability. Vision 2030’s goal to broaden Saudi economic competitiveness in many sectors—retail, renewables, defense, finance, tourism, health care, education—would be good for the country. Nonetheless, the boy geniuses of tech provide an imperfect model in the public sphere. They rush forward, damn the consequences. As President Obama pointed out just last year, “government will never run the way Silicon Valley runs because, by definition, democracy is messy. This is a big, diverse country with a lot of interests and a lot of disparate points of view.” And even in Saudi Arabia, where the monarchy doesn’t incorporate disparate points of view (to say the least), the idea that one can transform a society dependent on oil by making it instead dependent on an investment fund seems to overestimate the magic of modern finance—and, incidentally, the ease of generating returns as an investor. Should Kushner travel with his-father-in-law to Saudi Arabia (he is, after all, in charge of peace in the Middle East) he will almost certainly meet again with bin Salman, whether it’s alone, in a large group, or just the four of them—princes, President, and King. One can imagine the princes discussing the similarities of their programs and values, and maybe the boy geniuses they both know. It is harder to imagine a discussion of a particular risk facing them: whether either of them will be around to implement his program. The irony of the power that Prince bin Salman and Jared Kushner hold is its impermanence. Kushner’s reach extends no farther than Trump’s, and Trump’s support is rooted in a white working-class nostalgia for manufacturing and nineteen-fifties America. Prince bin Salman faces three threats: his ailing father’s mortality, family members with claims to his portfolio, and challenges to the entire ruling family’s power. The Saudi monarchy derives its wealth from Silicon Valley’s least favorite source of fuel and its social control from a conservative interpretation of Islam. Both crown princes stake their political legitimacy on being innovators and disruptors. But the foundation of their power seems more like what—and whom–our contemporary world is disrupting. It’s a good thing that the princes think of themselves as tech guys: they’re going to have to act fast. Gary Sernovitz is a writer and a managing director of a private-equity firm.

Tucson Police Chief Chris Magnus said a 30-year-old woman named Jennifer LaPlante is being investigated for allegedly purchasing and/or stealing baby formula from Tucson stores, replacing them with other substances including flour and some other contents, resealing the packages and then returning the formula to the stores for a refund. Magnus said LaPlante is believed to have been tampering with formula at several stores in Tucson, including Wal-Mart and Fry's, for several months. She may not have worked alone, police said. Laplante bought formula from several stores in Tucson including: Fry's at 7050 E. 22nd Street Fry's at 9401 E. 22nd Street Wal-Mart at 8040 Broadway Boulevard Wal-Mart at 7150 E. Speedway There could be other possible stores where the tainted product was returned, police said, but have not released those locations yet. At least one child was sickened from the tampered formula. That child was treated and released from the hospital on Friday, May. The brand Gerber Good Start Soy is one of the formula products that are believed to have been tampered with, Magnus said. According to police, there may be other formulas that are tainted, but those brands are not known at this time. Police said parents who may have bought formula from one of the stores should examine the container carefully. If it lacks a seal, if the seal is open or cracked or if it smells funny, don't use the product and notify the police. Suspicious products can be dropped off at Tucson Police Department Evidence facility at 945 East Ohio Street. Parents should carefully inspect containers before buying this type of product.

Details Published: 2017-05-12 09:06:58 Updated: 2017-05-12 09:09:26 Comments Increase Text Size Print this story Business US retail sales rebounded in April after sluggish winter Posted 9:06 a.m. yesterday Updated 9:09 a.m. yesterday Leave this field blank Your e-mail address:* Your friends e-mail addresses (comma separated):* Subject:* Message:*A friend wanted you to see this item from WRAL.com: http://wr.al/183qo Get a new codeAre you human?* You must enter the characters with black color that stand out from the other characters By CHRISTOPHER S. RUGABER, AP Economics Writer WASHINGTON — Americans stepped up their spending at auto dealers, hardware stores and e-commerce outlets as retail sales rebounded from two sluggish months. The Commerce Department said Friday that retail sales increased 0.4 percent in April from March. Sales ticked up just 0.1 percent in March and fell in February. The increase suggests that consumers are poised to spur faster growth in the April-June quarter after the economy barely expanded in the first three months of the year. Consumer spending — which also includes spending on services such as utilities — rose at its slowest pace in more than seven years in the first quarter. The rise also indicates that the struggles of large retail chains, such as Macy's and JC Penney's, reflect changes in consumer buying patterns more than broader economic weakness. Sales in a category that includes department stores, as well as general retailers such as Wal-Mart, fell 0.5 percent in April, the government said. Yet a category that includes online retailers reported sales growth of 1.4 percent, the strongest of any group. "The retail sales data provide further reason to expect that overall consumption growth will be much stronger in the second quarter," said Andrew Hunter, U.S. economist at Capital Economics. The sales gains were widespread, as Americans spent more at electronics and appliance stores, health care retailers, and sporting goods outlets. Sales fell at grocery stores and clothing merchants. Americans ate out more, boosting spending at restaurants and bars 0.4 percent. Auto sales rose 0.7 percent after falling in March. Consumer confidence has soared since the presidential election, but spending hasn't increased as much as the jump in optimism would suggest. Last month's gain in retail sales was solid but not particularly strong. Hiring has been steady and the unemployment rate fell to a ten-year low of 4.4 percent in April. Yet average hourly pay rose just 2.5 percent over the past year. And inflation has ticked up, eroding most of that wage gain. In a separate report, the Labor Department said consumer prices increased 2.2 percent in the past year. The slowdown in consumer spending over the winter added to the woes of many retailers. On Wednesday Macy's reported sharply lower sales and profits, causing a collapse in its share price. Brick-and-mortar retailers are suffering through their worst patch since the Great Recession. More than twice as many stores have closed this year than at the same point last year. Bankruptcies are far outpacing last year's rate. Retailers slashed jobs at the sharpest pace in seven years this spring. And retailers collectively could report the biggest drop in first-quarter profits since 2009. ___ This story has been corrected to show that a category including department stores reported a 0.5 percent drop in sales. Sales at department stores rose 0.2 percent, rather than falling 0.2 percent. Copyright 2017 by The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Facebook Pinterest Twitter Tumblr 0 byLauren Caruso 8 Shares 16 hours ago We’ve all probably heard this sage advice before: Instead of rubbing or smearing (I know, ew) skin-care products like moisturizers and serums onto your face, gently press them into your skin à la Clarins for the best results. And if my hyaluronic acid’s packaging and two separate estheticians are to be believed, the motion is supposed to promote lymphatic drainage and cut down on tugging, making gravity the only downward force wreaking havoc on your youthful appearance. Ok, sure. MORE: 13 Best Skin-Care Products You Didn’t Know Were at Walmart Maybe you heard that advice and it went in one ear and out the other, or maybe you took it to heart and have spent every night of your life carefully pushing said products into your face while you stare at your reflection in the mirror, smug with self-satisfaction. But one thing’s for sure: We kind of have no idea if it actually works. To find out, we turned to dermatologist and all-around awesome person Dr. Annie Chiu, who’s based out of Los Angeles. “This has to do with occlusion more—not drainage,” she tells me, throwing the idea that pushing molecules into your face will help drain your lymphatic system any better than a regular ol’ face massage right out the window. “In theory, occlusion of any type can drive active ingredients into the skin more. For example, when treating severe eczema, some dermatologists recommend Saran-wrapping your skin after using medications to drive them in more effectively.” Photo: Imaxtree And even though pressing or rubbing can create a temporary flush—thereby making you look a few years younger for about 10 minutes or so—vigorous rubbing will only upset your skin, possibly damaging the barrier function depending on what you’re rubbing with, and it can exacerbate problems like rosacea. But what about for those of us that don’t have any major skin issues? Does all that extra time spent physically pushing our skin-care products into our faces actually do anything, or is it just a way for brands to force customers to slow down while we use their products, creating a more spa-like experience—and therefore, a more positive connection—to the product. “Using our hands and the heat of our hands to ‘press’ [on the skin] can possibly improve delivery of actives such as vitamin C or retinol, pushing them deeper into the skin slightly. It’s more important for small molecules that act by penetrating the skin, rather than large molecules that hydrate the skin, such as hyaluronic acids.” So sure, pressing could possibly, in theory, maybe help your skin—and if it makes you slow down at night, so be it—but it’s more so about the experience. Here’s your pass to skip the pressing on anything that isn’t vitamin A- or C-based. MORE: 15 Best Skin Serums to Try For a Clear, Even-Toned Complexion 0 GOT THOUGHTS?

The Seattle-based retailer “is taking on the two companies that dominate online furniture sales” — Wayfair Inc. and Pottery Barn owner Williams-Sonoma Inc., The Wall Street Journal reported. Furniture is one of the fastest-growing segments of U.S. online retail, growing 18% in 2015, second only to groceries, according to Barclays. About 15% of the $70 billion U.S. furniture market has moved online, researcher IBISWorld says. “But even the biggest players in online furniture are struggling to get the market right. Unlike established categories such as books and music or even apparel, retailers are still hammering out basic concepts like how much variety to offer on their sites and the most efficient ways to deliver couches and dining sets to customers’ homes,” the Journal explained. While Amazon has been selling furniture for years, it has lately decided to tackle the sector more forcefully, the Journal reported. “Furniture is one of the fastest-growing retail categories here at Amazon,” said Veenu Taneja, furniture general manager at Amazon, in a statement. He said the company is expanding its selection of products, with offerings including Ashley Furniture sofas and Jonathan Adler home décor, and it is adding custom-furniture design services. Amazon is also speeding up delivery to one or two days in some cities, he added. Amazon keeps attacking rivals on nearly every conceivable front. Amazon owered its free shipping threshold to $25 from $35, undercutting Wal-Mart Stores Inc. by $10 and escalating a battle between the world’s e-commerce leader and the world’s biggest retailer, Bloomberg reported. The new minimum shows Amazon competing for shoppers who don’t pay $99-a-year for Amazon Prime, which includes free two-day shipping on millions of items as well as access to music and video. These customers are the Seattle-based company’s most loyal shoppers. Amazon will make non-Prime shoppers wait 5 to 8 business days for free shipping on more than 50 million items. Wal-Mart in January made a big push against Amazon Prime when the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retail giant offered free two-day shipping without a membership fee on orders of at least $35 while expanding its online marketplace inventory to include millions of items. The company last year acquired startup Jet.com for $3.3 billion in cash and stock and put its management team in charge of the online operation to strengthen its e-commerce business against Amazon. A company representative declined to comment on Amazon’s price move. (Newsmax wire services and Reuters and Bloomberg contributed to this report).

US retail sales rebounded in April after sluggish winter World by Christopher S. Rugaber, The Associated Press Posted May 12, 2017 6:48 am MDT Last Updated May 12, 2017 at 7:40 am MDT WASHINGTON – Americans stepped up their spending at auto dealers, hardware stores and e-commerce outlets as retail sales rebounded from two sluggish months. The Commerce Department said Friday that retail sales increased 0.4 per cent in April from March. Sales ticked up just 0.1 per cent in March and fell in February. The increase suggests that consumers are poised to spur faster growth in the April-June quarter after the economy barely expanded in the first three months of the year. Consumer spending — which also includes spending on services such as utilities — rose at its slowest pace in more than seven years in the first quarter. The rise also indicates that the struggles of large retail chains, such as Macy’s and JC Penney’s, reflect changes in consumer buying patterns more than broader economic weakness. Sales in a category that includes department stores, as well as general retailers such as Wal-Mart, fell 0.5 per cent in April, the government said. Yet a category that includes online retailers reported sales growth of 1.4 per cent, the strongest of any group. “The retail sales data provide further reason to expect that overall consumption growth will be much stronger in the second quarter,” said Andrew Hunter, U.S. economist at Capital Economics. The sales gains were widespread, as Americans spent more at electronics and appliance stores, health care retailers, and sporting goods outlets. Sales fell at grocery stores and clothing merchants. Americans ate out more, boosting spending at restaurants and bars 0.4 per cent. Auto sales rose 0.7 per cent after falling in March. Consumer confidence has soared since the presidential election, but spending hasn’t increased as much as the jump in optimism would suggest. Last month’s gain in retail sales was solid but not particularly strong. Hiring has been steady and the unemployment rate fell to a ten-year low of 4.4 per cent in April. Yet average hourly pay rose just 2.5 per cent over the past year. And inflation has ticked up, eroding most of that wage gain. In a separate report, the Labor Department said consumer prices increased 2.2 per cent in the past year. The slowdown in consumer spending over the winter added to the woes of many retailers. On Wednesday Macy’s reported sharply lower sales and profits, causing a collapse in its share price. Brick-and-mortar retailers are suffering through their worst patch since the Great Recession. More than twice as many stores have closed this year than at the same point last year. Bankruptcies are far outpacing last year’s rate. Retailers slashed jobs at the sharpest pace in seven years this spring. And retailers collectively could report the biggest drop in first-quarter profits since 2009. ___ This story has been corrected to show that a category including department stores reported a 0.5 per cent drop in sales. Sales at department stores rose 0.2 per cent, rather than falling 0.2 per cent.

(Jeff Piorkowski/special to cleveland.com) Print Email Jeff Piorkowski/special to cleveland.com By Jeff Piorkowski/special to cleveland.com Sun News Email the author on May 12, 2017 at 9:18 AM comments SOUTH EUCLID, Ohio -- The city's Planning Commission is working on guidelines to protect South Euclid from the eyesores that long-closed businesses can make of buildings. At the commission's meeting Thursday, discussions that have been taking place for more than a year continued on what will eventually become "dark store" legislation. Economic Development Director Michael Love that, with the coming in the past five years of larger, "big box" stores to the city, there has been concern about what would happen with the buildings should the businesses they house close. "A couple of years ago, we thought that we should find out how we could regulate these stores so we don't get left with stores that can't be filled," Love said. "Hopefully, (the regulations) won't ever be used." Large buildings, such as the Walmart at Oakwood Commons, at more than 100,000 square feet, can be extremely difficult to fill with a new tenant, should they close for good. "We're doing this to protect the city from nuisances and dilapidation," said Planning Commission member Dan Ivins. Other buildings that could qualify as big box include the Giant Eagle store, 4401 Mayfield Road; the T.J. Maxx and Burlington stores recently opened at Oakwood Commons; and the Marc's Store & Pharmacy currently being built at the corner of Mayfield and Green roads. The commission has been considering buildings with more than 40,000 square feet of space. At Thursday's meeting, however, Building Commissioner Eric Tuck-Macalla, suggested the commission widen its scope to include smaller, vacated commercial buildings, such as former fast food restaurant buildings, which can also linger without an occupant for months or years. As an example, commission member Carlean Alford mentioned the former Burger King store on South Green Road, which sat vacant for years before becoming home to a hot dog eatery, and then became vacant for a lengthy stretch once more. That building is now being made part of the redevelopment of Mayfield-Green, the project that includes construction of the new Marc's. Developers may demolish the building, or fully reconfigure it into a building that does not resemble its present appearance. As part of the dark store guidelines, Tuck-Macalla suggested commercial building owners post a bond. Should the building become vacant and need to be demolished or repaired after a fire, the city could use the money to do what is necessary. Further, he suggested some commercial buildings become part of a registry shortly after becoming vacant, as is done with the city's vacant homes. The commission is also examining guidelines for the state the property should be left upon its vacancy, including its landscaping. Chairman Ramon Adams said that a time frame as to when regulations will take hold following a building's vacancy is still be discussed. "If you consider Severance Center, that's a good example of what we're trying to avoid," Alford said of the Cleveland Heights shopping center that has seen a number of closings in the past couple of years. One of those closings was Walmart, which relocated to Oakwood Commons. Tuck-Macalla said he believes the dark store guidelines should not be enforced on retail strips, where one or more storefronts could be inhabited, while others have been vacated. When the commission completes its determination of guidelines, they will be sent with a recommendation to City Council, who would pass legislation making the guidelines a part of the city's code. In other retail business news, Love said Moe's Southwest Grill, which recently opened a store on Mayfield Road in Mayfield Heights, is set to open at Oakwood Commons on June 1. He also said that construction on the Seasons Kosher Market store at Oakwood Commons will begin in June and be completed next winter. cleveland.com is a partner of the Greater Cleveland Food Bank.

Karl Siebrecht, co-founder and CEO of Flexe. (PRNews Photo /FLEXE) Flexe, a Seattle startup that offers a marketplace for warehouse space, announced Thursday a new next-day delivery service, which the company said would give brands the ability to reach 98 percent of U.S. customers faster than Amazon Prime two-day shipping. Flexe has been amassing unused warehouse space that it can use as on-demand storage for companies, and its inventory now numbers more than 500 warehouses. Flexe says its new shipping service gives brands full control of the process from identifying ideal fulfillment center locations, to delivering product through integrations with all major carriers and even branding their own boxes. “For the first time in history, e-commerce brands have an alternative to Amazon,” said Flexe co-founder and CEO Karl Siebrecht, a former executive at aQuantive and AdReady. “Our customers are under tremendous pressure to meet consumer demand for fast, cheap shipping. Flexe gives them the same network scale as Amazon, allows them to ship products in their own branded box, and gets them up and running in 30 days.” A look at Flexe’s network of warehouses. (PRNewsfoto/ FLEXE) Shipping has become an important component of the retail world, mostly thanks to Amazon. Because of Prime, which offers free, two-day shipping on millions of items for a $99 annual fee or $10.99 per month, millions of people have become conditioned to expect quick, inexpensive delivery. Amazon has been lowering the barriers for free delivery, even for those without Prime, quietly cutting back the cost threshold from $35 to $25. And other retailers have responded. Walmart, for example, offers free, two-day shipping on orders over $35. Flexe’s new service will help companies that want to compete with giants like Amazon and Walmart in shipping, but don’t have the time or resources to build out their own supply chain. Flexe’s overall goal is to help those with unused space earn additional revenue, while enabling businesses to utilize a pay-as-you-go, on-demand model when they need additional warehouse space. This provides an alternative solution to the fixed costs that often come with a lease, particularly for retailers that only need extra storage space for a limited amount of time — perhaps a beverage vendor that sees sales spike in the summer, or a retailer that sells its inventory during the holiday season. Siebrecht has compared his company to Airbnb for the supply side, and Amazon Web Services on the demand side. Flexe last year raised $14.25 million in a funding round led by Redpoint Ventures, bringing total funding for the four-year-old startup to more than $20 million.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 12 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Sustainability Highlights: HP Takes Home Gold for Its Work to Make the Planet Green by Nathan Hurst, Chief Sustainability & Social Impact Officer SOURCE: HP, Inc. DESCRIPTION: As we continue to reinvent our products, business models and supply chain at HP, we are building a legacy of sustainable design. We are reducing our environmental impact, and leading by example to create a more efficient, circular and low carbon economy. HP has released additional products that reduce energy consumption, designed desktop solutions using less materials, and shifted to service models that lower environmental impact. We’ve committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, brought greater transparency about recycling practices to our product supply chain, and more. Our sustainability efforts aren’t just getting noticed – they’re being applauded by renowned organizations. Earning climate kudos Our sustainability strategy supports 16 of the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals, propelling our continued innovation in supply chain responsibility, circular economy integration, and empowerment for migrant workers, refugees and underserved populations.  HP is being recognized for our relentless dedication to these initiatives tonight at the 33rd annual World Environment Center (WEC) Awards at the Newseum in Washington, D.C. HP Chief Supply Chain Officer Stuart Pann will accept the Gold Medal for International Corporate Achievement in Sustainable Development on behalf of HP, and will be introduced on stage by HP Board Member Aida Alvarez. WEC is a non-profit dedicated to creating environmentally conscious business solutions, and their annual award is one of the most prestigious forms of recognition for global companies and sustainability practices.  “We are honored to be recognized by the World Environment Center for our ongoing commitment to reduce the environmental impact of our operations, supply chain and products—and to empower individuals and communities everywhere. Our commitment to sustainability is based on our company values and is core to our business,” Pann said of the award. Designing for energy efficient excellence Significant achievements expand beyond just the WEC Gold Medal Award. ENERGY STAR®, a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) program that helps businesses and individuals save money while protecting our climate through superior energy efficiency, awarded HP with its 2017 Excellence in Energy-Efficient Product Design award last month. The EPA introduced the ENERGY STAR program in 1992 to help identify and promote energy-efficient products to reduce greenhouse emissions. ENERGY STAR recognized that HP’s ability to deliver significant advancements in printer efficiency and consumer choice goes above and beyond the norm. Our key product design accomplishments that received accolades include: securing enormous savings in enterprise printing through HP PageWide Technology business printers that use up to 71 percent less energy than comparable laser printers; and committing to designing products that deliver greater energy efficiency, performance and value. Since 2010, HP has reduced energy consumption of its personal computing system portfolio by 25 percent, its HP LaserJet portfolio by 56 percent, and its HP inkjet portfolio by 20 percent on average. Learn more about the award here. Steering the sustainability conversation HP recently ranked number one in PCs, printing and printer ink on the Walmart sustainability scorecard. Seeking to learn more about our stance on sustainability, Walmart invited HP’s President of the Americas Christoph Schell to participate in a Leadership Listening Session at the company’s Annual Sustainability Milestone Summit last month.  During the plenary session, Schell and Walmart’s Senior Vice President of Merchandising Greg Hall took to the main stage to discuss how companies can develop energy-efficient products, with Schell highlighting the HP DeskJet 3752 all-in-one printer, which consumes 30 percent less energy while in sleep mode. That same day, Walmart boldly announced its goal to work with suppliers to eliminate a gigaton of greenhouse gas emissions in their supply chain by 2030. The target, known as Project Gigaton, equates to taking 211 million passenger vehicles off the road for an entire year. HP has publically committed to support this initiative.

But what is "OBL"? OBL fuel is a crystal that was discovered in the Andes Mountains. It is being hailed as the "Holy Grail" of energy. What Is OBL: The $7.2 Trillion Economic Revolution OBL is so valuable that the locals call it "Oro Blanco," which translates to "White Gold" because these crystals could be causing the next "gold" rush. The auto industry alone is set to increase demand for OBL fuel 11 times over its current production levels. Energy Breakthrough: One gallon of this new "crystal fuel" could get you from New York to L.A. and back… seven times! Read more… And the auto industry isn't the only one rushing to secure sources of OBL. Companies such as Alphabet Inc. (Nasdaq: GOOG) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE: WMT) are looking to independently produce the energy needed to power their offices and stores. OBL fuel is so powerful that it is becoming a large part of those corporate energy independence plans. With large corporations flocking to OBL fuel, demand is soaring, creating a huge profit opportunity… Securing Profits from OBL High demand and a scarcity of the crystals have the potential for this energy play to become larger than the fracking boom. In the last 14 months, OBL has doubled in price twice. With prices climbing that fast, it's easy to see how you can print money by securing a claim to OBL fuel. And that is exactly what a tiny little miner has done. It secured a claim in Death Valley potentially worth more than $20 billion. To make the profit opportunity even better, this miner has claims outside of Death Valley as well. With so much control over the supply, this tiny company is set to explode, giving early investors the opportunity to create generational wealth.

On Friday, May 12, 2017, the Commerce Department releases U.S. retail sales data for April. (AP Photo/Wilfredo Lee) US retail sales rebounded in April after sluggish winter Add to ... Christopher S. Rugaber WASHINGTON — The Associated Press Published Friday, May 12, 2017 8:34AM EDT Last updated Friday, May 12, 2017 9:13AM EDT Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print Americans stepped up their spending at auto dealers, hardware stores and e-commerce outlets as retail sales rebounded from two sluggish months. The Commerce Department said Friday that retail sales increased 0.4 per cent in April from March. Sales ticked up just 0.1 per cent in March and fell in February. The increase suggests that consumers are poised to spur faster growth in the April-June quarter after the economy barely expanded in the first three months of the year. Consumer spending — which also includes spending on services such as utilities — rose at its slowest pace in more than seven years in the first quarter. The rise also indicates that the struggles of large retail chains, such as Macy's and JC Penney's, reflect changes in consumer buying patterns more than broader economic weakness. Sales in a category that includes department stores, as well as general retailers such as Wal-Mart, fell 0.5 per cent in April, the government said. Yet a category that includes online retailers reported sales growth of 1.4 per cent, the strongest of any group. "The retail sales data provide further reason to expect that overall consumption growth will be much stronger in the second quarter," said Andrew Hunter, U.S. economist at Capital Economics. The sales gains were widespread, as Americans spent more at electronics and appliance stores, health care retailers, and sporting goods outlets. Sales fell at grocery stores and clothing merchants. Americans ate out more, boosting spending at restaurants and bars 0.4 per cent. Auto sales rose 0.7 per cent after falling in March. Consumer confidence has soared since the presidential election, but spending hasn't increased as much as the jump in optimism would suggest. Last month's gain in retail sales was solid but not particularly strong. Hiring has been steady and the unemployment rate fell to a ten-year low of 4.4 per cent in April. Yet average hourly pay rose just 2.5 per cent over the past year. And inflation has ticked up, eroding most of that wage gain.

Live Watch US retail sales rebounded in April after sluggish winter By christopher s. rugaber, ap economics writer WASHINGTON  May 12, 2017, 9:07 AM ET 0 Shares Email Star The Associated Press In this Wednesday, April 26, 2017, photo, window shoppers look into a store on Miami Beach, Florida's Lincoln Road. On Friday, May 12, 2017, the Commerce Department releases U.S. retail sales data for April. (AP Photo/Wilfredo Lee) 0 Shares Email Americans stepped up their spending at auto dealers, hardware stores and e-commerce outlets as retail sales rebounded from two sluggish months. The Commerce Department said Friday that retail sales increased 0.4 percent in April from March. Sales ticked up just 0.1 percent in March and fell in February. The increase suggests that consumers are poised to spur faster growth in the April-June quarter after the economy barely expanded in the first three months of the year. Consumer spending — which also includes spending on services such as utilities — rose at its slowest pace in more than seven years in the first quarter. The rise also indicates that the struggles of large retail chains, such as Macy's and JC Penney's, reflect changes in consumer buying patterns more than broader economic weakness. Sales in a category that includes department stores, as well as general retailers such as Wal-Mart, fell 0.5 percent in April, the government said. Yet a category that includes online retailers reported sales growth of 1.4 percent, the strongest of any group. "The retail sales data provide further reason to expect that overall consumption growth will be much stronger in the second quarter," said Andrew Hunter, U.S. economist at Capital Economics. The sales gains were widespread, as Americans spent more at electronics and appliance stores, health care retailers, and sporting goods outlets. Sales fell at grocery stores and clothing merchants. Americans ate out more, boosting spending at restaurants and bars 0.4 percent. Auto sales rose 0.7 percent after falling in March. Consumer confidence has soared since the presidential election, but spending hasn't increased as much as the jump in optimism would suggest. Last month's gain in retail sales was solid but not particularly strong. Hiring has been steady and the unemployment rate fell to a ten-year low of 4.4 percent in April. Yet average hourly pay rose just 2.5 percent over the past year. And inflation has ticked up, eroding most of that wage gain. In a separate report, the Labor Department said consumer prices increased 2.2 percent in the past year. The slowdown in consumer spending over the winter added to the woes of many retailers. On Wednesday Macy's reported sharply lower sales and profits, causing a collapse in its share price. Brick-and-mortar retailers are suffering through their worst patch since the Great Recession. More than twice as many stores have closed this year than at the same point last year. Bankruptcies are far outpacing last year's rate.

(shutterstock.com/Dean Drobot/File) For Carine Danblier, 51, a Belgian housewife based in Brussels, shopping on Chinese online marketplace AliExpress has proved to be nothing short of a treasure hunt. Every week, she snaps up cooking accessories, shoes and electronic gadgets directly from China via AliExpress, a subsidiary of Alibaba Group Holding. A few taps on her device keypad, followed by a few days in wait－that's all it takes for the tamper-proof parcels to materialize at her doorstep. So impressed was Danblier with AliExpress that she created a Facebook page just to share images of the goodies as well as information on online deals. Two years on, the page has 100,000 followers. Alibaba has also become famous in Europe for its Singles Day shopping extravaganza on Nov 11, which created a buzz on online social media. The shopping fest has made Alibaba the world's top e-commerce marketplace by transaction value. It reported a gross merchandise volume of $485 billion in fiscal year 2016. This is higher than $482 billion in revenues netted by Walmart Inc in the same period. Alibaba is expanding overseas aggressively using AliExpress, in the process taking on global rivals such as Amazon and eBay. Founded in 2010, AliExpress is the equivalent of Alibaba's business-to-customer site Tmall, but targets only overseas customers. It has attracted more than 100 million international buyers as of April, said Dai Shan, president of Alibaba's business-to-business unit. Following a decade of explosive growth, China's online retail market is expected to slow down to a 15 percent compounded annual growth rate, consultancy Mintel has projected. This means internet behemoths like Alibaba need to foray abroad for new sources of income. AliExpress is gaining traction among users such as Danblier by reshaping their shopping behavior and building a personal rapport, said Zuniga Perez Pell, an employee at AliExpress' Spanish operations. "Wedding is perhaps the most important occasion for women. In the past, Spanish women never bought wedding dresses online. But now, taking a look at AliExpress before buying is becoming a ritual," he said. Agreed John Arregui, a regular Spanish shopper on Ali-Express. His personal favorite is footwear. "I really like the clear assortment of all types of shoes, and I'd say China-made footwear is of superb quality." Alfonso Noriega Gomez, economic and commercial counselor of the Consulate General of Spain in Shanghai, believes e-commerce is an essential engine to promote trade and economic relations and a major conduit for products made around the world. "Through Tmall and Tmall Global, Chinese consumers are able to enjoy products from Spain. We hope AliExpress can bring alive the virtual Silk Road by connecting Chinese merchandise with countries including Spain," he said at an AliExpress conference in Hangzhou earlier this month. For Carine Danblier, 51, a Belgian housewife based in Brussels, shopping on Chinese online marketplace AliExpress has proved to be nothing short of a treasure hunt.(The China Post/File) Read also: Hijup tops list of most-followed e-commerce businesses on Instagram: Report Customers from more than 220 countries and regions have placed orders via the platform, according to the company. The top three countries ranked by total spending are Russia, the United States and Spain. Apart from Spain, AliExpress also found early success in Russia, by offering Chinese products including clothing and car parts at a lower price. It also advertised its services and teamed up with local payment providers. The platform has been Russia's biggest shopping site since 2014, according to researcher TNS. A wide array of goods, partnerships with several key Russian payment providers, and a strong social media presence have helped make AliExpress the top player, said Shen Difan, general manager in Russia. "AliExpress is planning to tie up with more local vendors, ship from local warehouses, and provide local after-sales service, including a no-excuse return policy in 72 hours," Shen said. Relatively super-quick delivery has become the real gamechanger. In Russia, parcels normally take weeks, or even up to two months, to reach buyers. Backed by big data technology, AliExpress has managed to shorten the delivery period to just four days. This is part of an even bigger goal of global delivery within 72 hours in three to five years, using algorithm-based realtime analysis by Cainiao Network Technology Co Ltd, Alibaba's smart logistics network. Alibaba will be wading into a number of markets where no single player has yet to dominate. Challenges abound. Many developing nations still lack the infrastructure crucial to widespread adoption of e-commerce. According to Wan Lin, Cainiao's president, the logistics network has teamed up with various postal services to ensure faster customs clearance, including a partnership with US Postal Service, Brazilian Post and Australian Post. It has picked up a stake in Singapore Post. It will manage logistics globally and provide users with global traceability of their parcel shipment movement. AliExpress aims to build a "cyber Silk Road" and serve up to 1 billion people from overseas, Shen said. "The Belt and Road Initiative, which aims to strengthen infrastructure, economic and trade ties in the Eurasian and Africa region, will lend AliExpress new momentum to grow its customer base tenfold in less than seven years." That creates a win-win scenario for both global shoppers and export-driven Chinese manufacturers, who are transitioning from being original equipment manufacturers to providers of higher-end branded products. Napearl, a Chinese curtain maker, is riding the consumption boom overseas. Via AliExpress, the company receives regular orders from US customers for tailor-made curtains used in villas. Its monthly revenue could top $500,000, said Wang Yuting, its operations director. Also reaping the gains is earphone maker Bluedio. According to Li Jiacheng, its marketing head, sales on Singles Day last year surged 120 percent compared to the previous fest. "We've devoted a 30-people taskforce to research and development of critical technologies, and are on course to bagging a handful of patents. We're building our own brand, and AliExpress is a good starting point," Li said. To date, AliExpress has groomed and fostered over 1,000 smaller merchants whose monthly sales in cross-border deals have surpassed $500,000 each. "While globalization offers many benefits to multinational corporations, the Belt and Road Initiative aims to unlock the potential of SMEs (small and medium enterprises) by enhancing connectivity, and e-commerce is a critical channel to reach that goal," said Zhao Lei, a professor at the Institute for International Strategic Studies, which is part of the Central Party School of the Communist Party of China.

Check out which companies are making headlines before the bell: J.C. Penney — The retailer earned an adjusted six cents per share for its latest quarter, compared to forecasts for a 21 cent loss. Revenue fell below forecasts, however, and same-store sales slid 3.5 percent compared to estimates of a 0.6 percent drop. Fiat Chrysler — The automaker voluntarily recalled 1.25 million Ram pickup trucks to fix a software issue involving the restraint system. The company said it knows of one fatality and two injuries related to the issue. One million of those trucks were sold in the U.S. market. Nordstrom — The retailer reported adjusted quarterly profit of 43 cents per share, well above estimates of 27 cents a share. Revenue was slightly above forecasts, but the comparable-store sales drop of 0.8 percent was more than analysts were anticipating. Sprint — Sprint and its controlling shareholder SoftBank have started preliminary talks about merging Sprint with T-Mobile US, according to a Bloomberg report. Corning — The glassmaker was awarded $200 million from Apple's new Advanced Manufacturing Fund. The money will support Corning's efforts to advance state-of-the-art glass processing. General Electric — GE was downgraded to "sell" from "hold" at Deutsche Bank, which also cut 2018 earnings estimates for the company and said the stock is overvalued given its weak earnings quality. AstraZeneca — The drugmaker said its immunotherapy drug durvalumab was shown to reduce the risk of death from lung cancer. Boeing — Boeing's 737 MAX jetliner will need its engines re-approved by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) before the jetmaker can begin deliveries after the new jet was grounded due to an engine issue. It is unclear how long the re-approval process might take. A spokesperson for engine maker CFM said discussions with the FAA are currently taking place. Wal-Mart — CEO Douglas McMillon has been ordered by a judge to answer questions in a shareholder lawsuit pertaining to alleged bribery in Mexico. McMillon had been president of Wal-Mart International when the alleged incidents took place. Wal-Mart said it is reviewing the order and considering its next steps. Anthem — Anthem failed in its bid to get a judge to order Cigna not to terminate its merger deal with Anthem. Anthem will have until Monday to decide if it will appeal the case to the Delaware Supreme Court. The Justice Department, along with 11 states, won their legal bids last year to halt the $54 billion deal, and Cigna accused its rival health insurer of breaching the agreement by failing to get regulatory approval. Amazon, Facebook, Alphabet, and Netflix – These stocks are all undervalued, according to billionaire investor Mark Cuban. He made his comments in an interview with CNBC's "Fast Money." CA Technologies — The software company reported quarterly profit 54 cents per share, beating estimates of 49 cents a share. Revenue was above forecasts, as well. Its results were helped in part by better-than-expected profit margins and software fees, but it did give full-year earnings guidance that was below Street forecasts. The Trade Desk — The company earned an adjusted 18 cents per share for its first quarter, well above consensus estimates of one cent a share. The provider of programmatic advertising technology also saw revenue come in above forecasts, as is its full-year guidance. Tiffany — The luxury goods retailer was upgraded to "buy" from "neutral" at Goldman Sachs, with a price target of $107 per share. Goldman said Tiffany offers a unique exposure to a resurgence in the luxury category, spurred by international tourists and the U.S. high-end consumer.

Coats chased the suspect down and held him until police arrived. (KATU Photo) AA PORTLAND, Ore. (KATU) — The man accused of cutting the hair of random women on TriMet buses, and convicted of similar crimes in the past, was taken into custody with the help of southeast Portland resident Christian Coats. Coats spotted Jared Walter at a southeast Portland Walmart Wednesday night and immediately recognized him as the man wanted by police. "I was trying to be friendly with him," said Coats. "Like, 'Hey, how are you doing, do you remember me?'" Walter was immediately spooked and took off down Southeast Holgate. Coats called 911 and immediately took off after him. After a 20-minute chase through neighborhoods, Coats cornered Walter on the side of a house on Southeast 89th. "He was hiding behind that chimney right there," said Coats, as KATU spoke to him at the scene. "I knew I had him, and he knew I had him too." Coats held Walter down for about 20 to 30 seconds before police officers took over. He doesn't regret taking the lead in pursuing Walter. "He's a sex offender. So I mean, sometimes you just have to take risks like that because that could have been my mom, it could have been one of my kids, so sometimes you just have to act," said Coats. Walter appeared in court Thursday. Given his criminal history, a judge ordered him not to be released on bail until prosecutors come up with a plan to keep him from committing similar crimes. close Trending 1   What parents need to know about the dangerous 'Blue Whale Challenge' 2   Manitowoc fire victims sheltered in junior high gym 3   Winnebago County Sheriff's Office switching to propane-fueled squad cars 4   Yellow road paint leaking into Fond du Lac River 5   Schneider releases first earnings report DON'T MISS OUT Stay Connected with WLUK Like Follow © 2016 Sinclair Broadcast Group TermsPrivacyFCC InfoEEO News In Pictures Cellphone shaped gun could be in stores this summer Manitowoc fire victims sheltered in junior high gym Gallery: Celebs taking a beach break State investigators looking into deadly Manitowoc apartment fire ShareTweet × Trending 1 What parents need to know about the dangerous 'Blue Whale Challenge' 2 Manitowoc fire victims sheltered in junior high gym 3 Winnebago County Sheriff's Office switching to propane-fueled squad cars 4 Yellow road paint leaking into Fond du Lac River 5 Schneider releases first earnings report 6 Cellphone shaped gun could be in stores this summer 7 2017 Good Day Wisconsin $25,000 Home Makeover Giveaway 8 Ready Eddy's sandwiches locally made in Marinette 9 Trial ordered in case of nude photos 10 Couple leaves $130,000 to Wisconsin Maritime Museum

Posted: Friday, May 12, 2017 1:45 am Keiki Day hits the streets Dennis Fujimoto - The Garden Island The Garden Island Newspaper | 0 comments LIHUE — Beverly Dorado donated for the first copy of the Keiki Day edition of TGI Thursday morning. But she never left, instead parking to keep Kauai Councilman Derek Kawakami company while he peddled editions at Kukui Grove Center. “This is good,” Kawakami said. “I can leave and make it in time for the budget meetings.” Keiki Day editions went on sale at select outlets, including the Starbucks entrance to Kukui Grove and Walmart as well as TGI’s Lihue office, to benefit Parents and Children Together. The Keiki Day edition was sold throughout the state, and through the generosity of sponsors, will be provided to schools. In addition to an overview of PACT and the services it provides to support individuals, families, and the community, the edition featured Kauai winners of the art and essay contests. Katelyn Lopes, a fourth-grade student from Kalaheo Elementary School, was a winner of the essay contest, being joined by Anna Hawks, a junior at Kapaa High School, and Lilly Olpin, a senior at Kauai High School. Katie Lambden, a fifth-grade student at Hanalei School, is joined by Lisie Coombs, recently moved to Alaska, and Nohea Balai, a sixth-grade student at the Kapaa Middle School, as winners of the art contest. “We’re blessed to have the help of community volunteers like Derek to help us,” said Cheryll DeSilva of PACT. Mayor Bernard Carvalho, Jr. and Ron Wiley of the KQNG Radio were among those volunteers, as was Ron Wood of FM97, who served a stint following his morning show. “This is for the kids,” a customer said. “I’ll take two copies.” © 2017 Thegardenisland.com.

During the April quarter, sales at Macy's stores open at least a year declined 5.2%, more than the 3% decrease analysts expected, according to Consensus Metrix, marking the ninth straight quarter that same-store sales have fallen. Shares of the company sank 17% to $24.35 on Thursday as profit also dropped. The stock has been pummeled this year, already falling 18% through Wednesday's close. "Don't count us out, we're not dead," Karen Hoguet, Macy's chief financial officer, said in an interview. The company is rolling out several initiatives that it expects to lift sales, including reconfigured shoe and fine-jewelry departments, she added. "While we'll be operating fewer stores, we have the opportunity to make our stores better." The government is expected on Friday to release its monthly retail sales data, with economists expecting a 0.5% increase for April following two months of declines. Ms. Hoguet said that despite an uptick in sales in March and April from an unusually weak February, Macy's wasn't banking on a rebound in consumer spending this year. Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT Kohl's Corp., Nordstrom Inc. and Hudson's Bay Co., which owns Saks Fifth Avenue and Lord & Taylor, also reported declines in same-store sales for the three months ended April 29. Kohl's Chief Executive Kevin Mansell said sales and traffic improved as the quarter progressed. February same-store sales declined around 8%, while same-store sales in the combined March-April period were down just 1%. Mr. Mansell said February could have been affected by the slower-than-usual receipt of tax refunds. Nordstrom's total sales rose 2.7% to $3.3 billion for the period. Same-store sales fell 2.8% at its department stores and Nordstrom.com. But the measure rose 2.3% at Nordstrom Rack, its off-price chain. Profits increased to $63 million from $46 million a year ago. The retail sector is in focus on Wall Street over the next few days, with J.C. Penney Co. scheduled to report results on Friday and Home Depot Inc., Target Corp. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. next week. Foot traffic continues to dwindle at brick-and-mortar stores as shoppers increasingly opt to make purchases online. Retailers have responded by shutting stores and cutting jobs. "The past year will be remembered as one of the most challenging periods for 'brick and mortar' retailers," Sears Holdings Corp. Chief Executive Edward Lampert wrote in a blog post Thursday, adding that the Sears and Kmart chains were "fighting like hell" to transform to meet these challenges. Macy's early this year said it would eliminate more than 10,000 jobs and detailed plans to close dozens of stores after another weak holiday season, further signaling that department stores have lost their once-central place in American retailing. The 159-year-old retailer has been testing programs to lift sales, such as weeding out certain shoe styles and buying deeper in the ones its merchants considered winners. It also added more color and fashion and armed its sales staff with technology to make it easier for them to see what was in stock. In certain stores, Macy's tested an open sales format similar to DSW Inc. The changes, which will be rolled out to all stores by August, drove a double-digit increase in shoe sales. Macy's Chief Executive Jeffrey Gennette, who took the reins from Terry Lundgren in March, said he expects the expanded programs will have a measurable impact starting this quarter and building through the fall. "In 2017, we are focused on taking actions to stabilize our brick-and-mortar business," Mr. Gennette said. In all for the first quarter, Macy's posted a profit of $71 million, or 23 cents a share, down from $116 million, or 37 cents a share, a year earlier. Overall sales fell 7.5% to $5.34 billion, below expectations of $5.47 billion, in part owing to store closings. Still, Macy's backed its 2017 guidance for total sales to be down between 3.2% and 4.3%. Kohl's said inventory management helped it improve its bottom line in the first quarter despite lackluster sales. Gross margin widened and adjusted earnings per share beat Wall Street estimates by a dime. Kohl's has made a big bet on activewear, with its Under Armour launch and an expanded Nike business, and that helped lift sales in the quarter, Mr. Mansell said. He added that Kohl's is beginning a targeted effort to capture sales from competitors who are closing stores in the hopes of boosting traffic at its own locations. But the company is also continuing to focus on expense reduction and plans to outline broader cost-cutting plans when it reports its next quarterly results in August. Kohl's stock fell 7.8% to $37.16, while Nordstrom was down 7.6% to $46.21. Corrections & Amplifications Nordstrom's total sales rose in the most recent quarter, while same-store sales fell 2.8% at its department stores and Nordstrom.com. They rose 2.3% at Nordstrom Rack. An earlier version of this article incorrectly said total sales fell, with same-store sales falling 1.7% at its department stores and rising 8% at Nordstrom Rack.

The general details of the legislation should now be well known: 1. repeal the Affordable Care Act’s (ACA) mandate that Americans purchase health insurance; 2. Eliminate the ACA’s health insurance exchanges and replace individual federal subsidies for those buying on state health care exchanges with health care-related tax credits; 3. Eliminate the tax increase on individuals earning more than $200,000 a year, and couples earning over $250,000, needed to pay for the health insurance exchange subsidies; 4. Empower states to allow insurers to increase their rates, denying health care to individuals with pre-existing conditions; and 5. Allow states to create high-risk pools for individuals seeking insurance who are priced out of traditional insurance markets due to pre-existing conditions. The health care system in the U.S. is deeply dysfunctional, and the status quo set up under Obama’s ACA is unsustainable. On the one hand, the ACA’s mandate and subsidies have resulted in millions of Americans registering for care, and the number of uninsured Americans has fallen significantly, from 17.1 percent in late 2013 to 10.9 percent in early 2017. On the other hand, just because more people have health care doesn’t mean it’s affordable care. Numerous health insurers have left the federal and state insurance exchanges entirely, including Aetna, Humana, United Health, and others, because they oppose paying higher costs to insure sick Americans with pre-existing conditions. The ACA was premised on the notion that insurers could better cover the costs of sick individuals if large numbers of healthy Americans were also forced to buy insurance on state insurance exchanges, thereby spreading the cost of caring for the sick across many policy holders. But these costs are greater than many insurers are willing to bear, and we’re now seeing a strong push back via insurance companies abandoning the exchanges entirely or radically increasing the cost of their plans on those exchanges. As the Kaiser Family Foundation estimates, the number of insurers operating in exchange markets declined in 74 percent of all states from 2015 to 2017. While an average of 6 insurers operated in each state in 2015, the number had fallen to 4 by 2017. A third of American states (17 total) now only have one or two insurers offering coverage on their exchanges, hardly enough to promote any sort of meaningful competition that might encourage rate reductions for customers. Furthermore, costs have skyrocketed for the plans that are available. Kaiser estimates that health insurance premium costs increased by more than 10 percent in two-thirds of American states from 2016 to 2017 alone. The average 40-year-old purchasing a silver insurance plan on an exchange across the 50 states saw their premiums increase by a whopping 24 percent from 2016 to 2017. Such a massive increase in health costs is a massive red flag for consumers. Coupled with double digit increases in the cost of care each year, and over many years, it suggests that the health care system is fundamentally broken, with Americans increasingly being priced out of coverage. The reason for the recent spike in costs, and for insurers’ flight from the exchanges, should be obvious: profit motive. In a for-profit health care system, insurers strongly oppose providing affordable care to sick Americans. In a privatized health care system, corporations treat the sick as a threat to profits. The notion, embraced in the insurance industry, that companies should be able to price sick people out of the health care market is incredibly callous, pathological, and evil, at least if society’s goal is to provide for the needs of citizens. But quality coverage for the greatest number of people, including the sick, is not the goal of health care corporations. They seek to maximize profits, while minimizing health care expenses. The ACA’s Democratic supporters naively thought they could play nice with the insurers, and that insurance companies would cover the sick (with the help of government subsidies), without gouging consumers. Obviously, they were wrong. Democrats could have introduced a system of price controls into the ACA to prevent private insurers from gouging citizens. Or they could have passed a health insurance reform with a “public option,” in which the government provides coverage to the sick and poor, independent of corporate insurers. Neither of these solutions was deemed acceptable by the Democrats. The party gained attention in late April of this year, when 104 Democrats – a majority of party members in the House – co-sponsored a universal health care bill. But majority support from the party’s rank-and-file doesn’t count for much when party leaders oppose such efforts. The ACA was never a solution to the health care travesty afflicting Americans, and those who have experience with the law know this all too well. I was forced to purchase health insurance for my wife and two children on the Illinois insurance exchange from 2014 through 2016. At the time, I was employed as a full-time, tenured professor by a small college, where administrators pursued a scorched-earth policy against their employees, refusing to pay a cent for family health insurance. Under the Wal-Mart model of education, every penny saved is a penny earned in the minds of the neoliberal administrative class. At the time, I was nearly bankrupted by health care costs, despite Obama’s promises to provide “affordable” care for all Americans. My wife required several medical surgeries following her two miscarriages, and an additional surgery due to complications following the birth of our second son. Furthermore, my oldest son is Autistic, and was receiving expensive therapies, which meant large out-of-pocket costs and deductibles. My younger son also required expensive therapies, as he suffers from a medical condition called Apraxia – a neurological condition that delays speech-development and other motor skills. The costs for my wife and two sons on the Illinois exchange were prohibitive. Not even counting my own insurance costs, my family costs averaged between $17,000 to $20,000 a year. For a college professor making less than $65,000 a year after taxes, such costs were prohibitive. Despite my negative experiences under the ACA, the law did get a few things right. The law expanded Medicaid, while banning insurers from denying people care due to pre-existing conditions. It also raised taxes on higher income Americans to provide insurance subsidies to working families buying insurance on the ACA exchanges. Despite the ACA’s flaws, the Republican AHCA plan is even worse. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the bill would result in 24 million Americans losing their insurance in the face of the cutting back Medicaid eligibility, the elimination of federal insurance subsidies to individuals, the collapse of the insurance exchanges, and the re-introduction of pre-existing conditions denials. The repeal of the ACA mandate means a significant reduction in the pool of individuals buying health insurance on the private market. Individuals within various social groups are likely to self-select out of coverage. Some examples include: poorer, young Americans who feel they are healthy enough to go without health insurance; previous Medicaid recipients who are no longer eligible for coverage; working and middle class individuals who were already struggling to pay for the exorbitant costs of health care, and are no longer required to do so; and sick individuals who will be priced out of the traditional insurance market, and unable to afford coverage in the high-risk pools. There was much talk from Republicans about coercing Americans to remain on their insurance plans, and that leaving such plans would mean their insurers would increase premiums by 30 percent if they decided to drop their plan and later re-enroll. This proposal was supposed to ensure that individuals would not simply drop their coverage once the ACA mandate was eliminated, and would remain on their insurance so that enough healthy Americans stayed in insurance pools to help pay for sicker Americans. But this proposal isn’t realistic. From the point of view of low-income individuals struggling to pay for insurance, why worry about the potential higher costs of health care that may materialize further down the road when you can’t afford the health care costs in front of you now? Republicans seem quite disconnected from reality when it comes to the harmful effects that will flow from the AHCA. Their policies will hurt millions of people. They want to replace the current federal subsidies under the ACA, which go to insurers and allow individuals to pay lower health care premiums, with even more health care-related tax deductions for individuals who purchase private insurance. This plan will further subsidize the affluent – those who can already afford health care – while harming poorer, working Americans relying on the subsidies to afford any insurance at all. The elimination of insurance exchange subsidies for individuals will cause millions to drop out of the insurance market. What good is a tax rebate if you can’t afford the monthly premiums, out-of-pockets, and deductible costs for your insurance plan? Republicans have also proposed creating “high-risk pools” to cover Americans with pre-existing conditions who are uninsurable in an environment that allows insurance corporations to jack up rates on the sick, effectively denying them coverage. But the funding for these pools is anemic at best, as is now clear from looking at the Republicans’ House bill. Providing a more conservative cost estimate, Larry Levitt of the Kaiser Family Foundation estimates that the high-risk pools will cost at least $25 billion a year. Other groups, such as the liberal Center for American Progress (CAP), estimate the pools may cost $33 billion a year. As CAP reports, funding the high-risk pools will cost $330 billion over 10 years, despite funding provisions under the Republican House proposal amounting to just $13 billion a year, or $130 billion over 10 years. Although Republicans added another $8 billion to cover the high-risk pools before passing the bill, this still amounts to as much as a $192 billion shortfall over a decade. In other words, available funds from the House bill will provide only 55 percent of all funds needed according to Kaiser’s more conservative estimate of the high-risk pools’ cost, and just 40 percent of the cost according to CAP’s more expansive estimate. Are we to believe that insurance companies will simply eat the cost of hundreds of billions in health care payments to sick enrollees, in light of the federal government’s shortchanging of high-risk pools? If these pools receive only half of the funds required to provide benefits to sick Americans, why wouldn’t we assume the rest of the costs will be pushed onto consumers, especially if the AHCA legally allows insurers to do so? If sick Americans are priced out of high-risk pools that are exorbitantly expensive, then we have essentially returned to the pre-ACA status quo of denying millions care due to pre-existing conditions. As the Center for American Progress estimates, 31 million Americans are currently insured through “small-group” and “individual markets” with “about half of whom likely have at least one pre-existing health condition.” CAP projects that the high-risk pools, as currently constituted, are likely to provide care to less than 2 million people, a small fraction of the more than 15 million people with pre-existing conditions. Insurers are already abandoning the ACA exchanges at an alarming rate, despite heavy federal subsidies for insurance buyers, and a large pool of customers to help defray the costs of caring for sick individuals. If under the best of conditions, private health insurers are unwilling to cover the (admittedly expensive) costs of the sick, what makes one think that they will be willing to do so with heavily under-funded high-risk pools with only sick people in them? The obvious answer is that insurers won’t provide affordable care through these pools. In short, the Republican plan for dealing with sick Americans is a clunker. It’s dead-on-arrival, merely reinstituting the old, pre-ACA status quo that denied millions of Americans accessible care. There are some potential alternatives that could deal with the problems at hand, if Democrats and Republicans were willing to consider them. These include: 1. Retaining the ACA’s subsidies to individuals purchasing health insurance on an exchange, while imposing strong cost-control regulations on private insurers for the health care plans they provide, coupled with a continued prohibition on denying individuals care due to pre-existing conditions; 2. Introducing a “public option,” in which the federal government “cuts out the middleman” private insurer, and provides needed care directly to all sick and uninsured Americans; or 3. Creating a universal health care system, which eliminates the primary cause of the central problem with American health care – for-profit health insurers that are dead-set on denying affordable care to the sick and needy. If most Democrats are serious about a universal health care system, the path forward is obvious: remove the current leadership of the party, including Pelosi, Schumer, and any others who stand in the way of progressive reform. If rank-and-file Democrats are not themselves serious about implementing a universal health care system, then Americans must remove the Democratic Party itself from power, replacing it with a party committed to progressive, social democratic policies.

(Kas Roussy/CBC) Kas Roussy Senior Reporter Kas Roussy is a senior reporter with the Health unit at CBC News. In her more than 30 years with CBC, Kas’s reporting has taken her around the globe to cover news in countries including Pakistan and Afghanistan, Chile, Haiti and China, where she was the bureau producer.

A popular drug that promises rapid relief from diarrhea is worrying doctors and emergency room staff because of the dangerous high it gives opioid abusers. The over-the-counter medication Imodium, whose main ingredient, loperamide, is an opioid, is cheap and easy to buy at a drugstore. It's available in bulk at Walmart and Costco. "Drug users, opioid seekers, they are desperate," says Nardine Nakhla, a lecturer at the faculty of pharmacy at the University of Toronto. "They need this medication to help with the withdrawal, or to achieve that euphoric state. So they disregard the warning and still use the drug if it means they get their fix." Imodium is safe when taken as directed. The maximum recommended daily dose is 16 milligrams, or eight tablets. 'We are starting to see more and more people coming to hospital or just dying suddenly at home,' says Dr. David Juurlink about Imodium abuse. (CBC) "It's been likened to a poor man's methadone", says Dr. David Juurlink, a drug safety researcher at Sunnybrook Hospital. "At high doses, it will cause effects like methadone or oxycontin. The problem is the doses you need to achieve that is really, really dangerous." Juurlink says its not uncommon for drug abusers to take up to 200 tablets a day to get high. "It can cause your heart to stop. It's the sort of thing people can do for weeks or months at a time, with no symptoms at all, then suddenly they just drop dead," says Juurlink. He says people abusing this drug will put a few hundred pills in a blender, make a smoothie and drink it. "That's especially dangerous because you absorb the drug very quickly." 'People are dying': Opioid antidote hard to find New guidelines for prescribing opioids At Vancouver's St. Paul's Hospital, Dr. Chris DeWitt calls an Imodium overdose a "double whammy." "It can cause slow breathing or even stopping breathing, similar to other opioids. But it can also cause direct effects on the heart." Dr. Chris DeWitt says a loperamide overdose is a 'double whammy' because it can stop a person's breathing and increase heart palpitations. (CBC) On web forums, drug abusers have been talking about the "lope cocktail" for several years. One writes that Imodium may be his "new best friend."  Another says his loperamide high "almost killed me a couple times with crazy pressure in my head."  In the U.S, the number of calls to poison centres have doubled between 2010 and 2015.  Several people have died of loperamide overdoses. The alarming trend prompted the Food and Drug Administration to issue a safety alert last year warning that higher than recommended doses of Imodium can cause serious heart problems that can lead to death. The Ontario Poison Centre reports only a "couple of cases" of Imodium poisoning, but its medical director, Dr. Margaret Thompson, can't say whether those involved an overdose or a death because of patient confidentiality. (CBC) Juurlink says the small number of cases doesn't tell the whole story.   "We are starting to see more and more people coming to hospital or just dying suddenly at home courtesy of this drug that most of us perceive as pretty innocuous."  A soon to be released review co-authored by Juurlink warns Canada's emergency room physicians to watch for increasing misuse and abuse of loperamide, with patients suffering from "loperamide-induced cardiac toxicity." It's a challenge for doctors because the go-to antidote Naloxone works to reverse an opiod overdose but can't fix heart problems caused by this medication. Juurlink says doctors sometimes have to resort to "Hail Mary therapies." Affected people have "grossly abnormal" electrocardiograms, he says. "When a person has that sort of ECG, we don't have a magic drug that we can just give to reverse it." Imodium is widely available and cheap in drugstores and grocery stores. (Kas Roussy/CBC) Health Canada says it's aware of health warnings for Imodium in the U.S. The agency says it has conducted a preliminary review of the issue and has not found evidence of a similar problem here, but it will monitor the safety of the drug. In a Toronto drugstore, Nakhla says she believes more needs to be done to prevent Imodium abuse. "I think pharmacists need to be adequately monitoring patients who are coming in requesting this type of medication," she said. "They need to think about further restricting the sale of this by placing it behind the counter where they will be in contact with the individual who will be purchasing it." Juurlink agreed. "If you couldn't just walk in a drugstore and for $20 walk out with enough of the tablets to get high and possibly kill you, I think that would be a good thing," he said.

U.S. District Judge Susan Hickey in Fayetteville, Arkansas, said McMillon's "direct and personal involvement" in matters underlying a class-action lawsuit justified requiring him to sit for a deposition by the shareholders' lawyers. McMillon had been president of Wal-Mart International during a period when shareholders led by a Michigan pension fund said the retailer concealed suspected bribery by its Wal-Mart de Mexico unit to government officials, to speed up store openings. The Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer had argued that McMillon lacked the "unique or special knowledge" to justify burdening him with a deposition. But the judge said McMillon, who became chief executive in February 2014, took part in several meetings, saw dozens of communications, and had certified many public statements by Wal-Mart about the alleged bribery. "It appears to the court that McMillon has unique knowledge of relevant issues in this litigation that only he can explain," Hickey wrote. A deposition could last four hours, she added. Wal-Mart spokesman Randy Hargrove said: "We are reviewing the order and contemplating our next steps." Jason Forge, a lawyer for the lead plaintiff City of Pontiac General Employees' Retirement System, said in an email: "We're determined to try this case in court." Wal-Mart's market value slid $17 billion over three days in April 2012 after the New York Times reported the alleged bribery and said it had been first discovered internally in 2005. Shareholders accused Wal-Mart and Mike Duke, who preceded McMillon as chief executive, of downplaying the scheme even after learning about the Times' investigation. The class period runs from Dec. 8, 2011 to April 20, 2012. Earlier this week, Bloomberg News said Wal-Mart may pay about $300 million to settle a U.S. government probe into suspected bribery in Mexico, India and China, citing people familiar with the matter. A $300 million payment would represent about one week of profit for Wal-Mart. The case is City of Pontiac General Employees' Retirement System v. Wal-Mart Stores Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Western District of Arkansas, No. 12-05162.

Because time travel doesn’t exist yet. Oh crap. Mother’s Day is Sunday and, if you’re reading this, chances are, you don’t have a present for your mom yet. (Or you do, but you just take pleasure in the desperate floundering of those not as considerate as you are.) And, while we live in a society of instant gratification, there comes a point in every week when not even Amazon Prime can save you. The delivery estimates are just cutting it a little too close and you’re forced to realize “Jeff Bezos can’t even help me now.” So what do you do? How to do spare your family from the “I got you a box of chocolates from the gas station” shame? Go to the mall? What, is this the 1990s? What are you doing to do? Stroll around Nordstrom trying to remember your mom’s blouse size or trying to pick out new shoes for the mother of your children even though you can’t remember if she’s a size 4 or a size 14? Don’t fall into the usual last-minute Mother’s Day gift traps. Your wife or your mom will KNOW if you just grabbed something off the seasonal shelf at Wal-Mart and they will never forget it. (Parents can always tell.) But, if you don’t have time to order online, there are still some very simple, very effective, very thoughtful-seeming Mother’s Day gifts that you can absolutely pull together with almost no notice. Here are 5 last minute Mother's Day gift ideas that will make the mom in your life think that you’re the sweetest person ever… even if we all know the ugly truth.   1. Make her a meal. via GIPHY This is fast, relatively simple, and all it takes is a tiny bit of prep and a trip to the grocery store. The idea is that you wanted to give your mom handmade this year, but, since you’re a little old to be making clay ashtrays, you decided to treat her to a home-cooked meal. (This takes on additional significance if you’re the type of person who never really cooks.) Spend five minutes on a recipe website, find something that sounds tasty yet more elaborate than a normal Sunday night dinner, and invite your mom over early to make chit-chat while you prepare your meal. (She might even pitch in.)   2. Write her a hand-written letter. via GIPHY If you want to tug on the heartstrings this Mother’s Day, THIS is the way to do it. Because who hand-writes letters anymore? I can barely hold a pencil anymore — those muscles have atrophied while my typing fingers have gained Hulk-like strength — so, simply taking the time to sit down and write out (in your best hand-writing) how much you love and appreciate your mom… that’s huge. That’s the modern equivalent of carving their name in hieroglyphs on the wall of a tomb. Your mom will treasure it forever… and you can do it in like 10 minutes.   3. Buy her a collection of her favorite movies on iTunes. via GIPHY This seems fast and simple, but it’s harder than it sounds. The idea sounds awesome — “Hey, I bought you a selection of your top 10 all-time favorite movies.” BUT, if your wife, baby mama, or actual mama is an IOS user, it means you need to get a hold of their iTunes account. And you don’t just want to order stuff via their logged-in Apple account because it will charge them for it. So here’s what you do. You figure out what movies you want to buy — you get extra points for your thoughtful curation — and how much they’ll cost. You then get iTunes gift cards for that amount (either online or at the drugstore). You get access to your favorite mom’s iTunes account, you redeem the gift cards, and then you buy them the movies. That way the movies from you, but you don’t seem like a moocher for charging their credit card.   4. Print out a selection of your favorite family photos. via GIPHY Printed photos have become exponentially more impressive in this day and age, because, let’s be honest, most of our photographs just live on our phones. We Instagram them, we share them on Facebook, but we rarely actually have a physical copy of the photo in our hands. So simply the act of printing out some of those photos can seem like a really thoughtful gift. But don’t print them on a home printer — the ink is expensive and they always look crappy. Here’s what you do… if you use a service like Shutterfly, you can normally send your photos to any big chain drugstore in your area and have them printed in an hour. (They can’t do crazy sizes so you’ll have to be OK with normal 4x6s.) Get 20-30 photos printed in an hour (surprisingly cheap) and then find some fun way to display them. Maybe buy a photo album at Target. Maybe get a nice poster board and do a cool collage. But you will seem super thoughtful on Mother’s Day for just taking those photos on your phone and bringing them into the real world.   5. Buy tickets to an upcoming event. via GIPHY This is a great last-minute idea because you can literally just do it from your phone or computer, but you do have to do a little… showmanship to convince your mom that you’ve been planning this for AGES. The key is finding SOME big local event that your wife or mom would really, really want to attend. A rock concert, a musical, maybe her favorite author is doing a reading. (Again you get extra points if you would never normally want to attend such an event.) Basically, you just find something they’d want to go to, buy the tickets online, print out the confirmation, and put it in a card. When you present the card, you have to go on and on about how you’re SO sorry that you don’t have anything tangible to give them today, but you just really wanted to give them an EXPERIENCE more than some cheap THING. (Really lay it on thick.) One word of warning — if you’re printing out a confirmation, make sure that they can’t see the date you ordered the tickets on the paper or else they’ll know “This jerk ordered these 5 minutes ago.”   ANY of these gift ideas can help make Mother’s Day special, especially if you only remembered that Mother’s Day was coming on Saturday. They all involve a tiny bit of prep work, but they stress personal connections and handmade sentiments, which, trust us, moms go nuts for you. Should you feel bad about throwing together a gift like these at the very last second? NO. Because your mom loves you no matter what AND she also probably knows you well enough that she wouldn’t expect anything else. like us on facebook If you 'like' us, we'll LOVE you!

For two decades, a loose-knit group that includes some of the country’s wealthiest people has underwritten the political push for school choice, promoting ballot initiatives and candidates who favor competition for traditional public schools. But when a member of this elite group was elevated to education secretary, the appointment opened a philosophical schism that now threatens to shatter the alliance, turn billionaires against each other and possibly lead some school-choice advocates to join with teachers’ unions, their archenemies. Fueling the split is the anticipation of a plan from President Donald Trump’s administration that could offer parents federal dollars to send their children to private schools, including religious and for-profit institutions. “As much as we are aligned on change, we aren’t always aligned on how much change or how. Sometimes we fight,” said Derrell Bradford, executive vice president of the school-reform group 50CAN. The movement has been cleaved into two camps: those who want to use choice to improve public schools and others, like Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, who want to go further by allowing tax money to flow to private schools through vouchers, government-funded scholarships or corporate tax credits. The differences that once seemed minor are at the heart of a potential seismic shift in the school-choice movement. School-choice programs were first proposed in the 1950s by Nobel Prize-winning free-market economist Milton Friedman. Since the beginning of this century, they have grown quickly, although the overwhelming majority of students still attend traditional public schools. Thirty states plus Washington, D.C., have some combination of vouchers, government-subsidized education savings accounts or tax credits that help families afford private-school tuition or encourage private groups to fund scholarships, according to EdChoice, an advocacy group founded by Friedman and his wife. Still, less than 1 percent of children in kindergarten through high school used vouchers to attend private schools in 2015. Just 5 percent of students were in charter schools that year, when charters were operating in more than 40 states. That’s up from about 3 percent in 2008, according to the Department of Education. Charter schools are public but in several states are not held to the same accountability standards as traditional schools, which in theory gives them more freedom to innovate. When standardized test scores of children who switched to charter schools or used vouchers are compared with those of students who remained in traditional public schools, some results have been promising. Other studies have shown little effect or even worse outcomes. THE BIGGEST DONORS Wal-Mart’s Walton family, Los Angeles billionaire Eli Broad and the father of Microsoft founder Bill Gates have been some of the largest political contributors to the school-reform movement, according to an analysis by The Associated Press of campaign-finance records compiled by the National Institute on Money in State Politics and state campaign-finance regulators. Microsoft’s Bill Gates avoids political contributions. His family’s massive foundation — which his father, Bill Gates Sr., co-chairs — is a major contributor to education-reform nonprofits. The elder Gates contributes personally as well. In the past, contributions have flowed to reform-minded groups regardless of whether they supported public charter schools, vouchers for private schools or a combination. Now those funders are beginning to split into competing camps. Groups such as Stand for Children, which pushes for charter schools among other educational changes, are being more vocal now because “the level of ambition of the efforts to expand vouchers is so high,” said Jonah Edelman, co-founder and chief executive, who called the voucher proposals “a dramatic effort to undermine public education.” Edelman, whose organization receives part of its funding from Walton, Broad and Gates-related charities and family members, said his group will fight any administration effort to promote vouchers nationwide. Stand for Children has worked with teachers unions in the past on state-level measures to provide more money for schools and raise teacher pay. But its calls for more charters often put it at odds with the unions, which are powerful political entities in many states. The American Federation of Teachers has had conversations with some charter school advocates it has opposed in the past about coordinating to fight a national voucher program, said Randi Weingarten, president of the union. To identify those who have shaped the school-choice movement across the country, the AP analyzed the political contributions of 48 individuals and couples who have given at least $100,000 to related statewide ballot measure campaigns. That group accounted for the majority of reported contributions to campaigns favoring school-choice initiatives from 2000 through last year. The donors nearly matched all the measures’ opponents. The group also wields political clout in addition to school-related ballot initiatives. The AP analysis showed that the same wealthy funders contributed a total of more than $200 million from 2007 through last year to candidates and political action committees, some of which are supporters of school choice. The funders are from a variety of industries and regions, with a concentration of investors and tech innovators from Seattle and Silicon Valley. Some give millions more to research centers, legal funds, foundations, charter schools and scholarships that promote pieces of the cause. Political campaigns often are a clash of titans. The nation’s two largest teachers’ unions — the National Education Association and American Federation of Teachers, which have 4.5 million members combined — contributed $573 million to campaigns and political action committees over the same 10-year period, much of it designed to counter the spending of the wealthy families and their affiliated groups. Both unions and school-choice advocates also made independent political expenditures, which are impossible to tally because the details are not required to be reported in many states. THE HEART OF THE DEBATE For the past decade, school-choice supporters have split over the merits of private-school vouchers versus public charter schools, according to William Oberndorf, a San Francisco investor, major contributor to the movement and chairman of the American Federation for Children, which was led by DeVos until last year. He urged all school-choice advocates to drop their divisions and support the core belief that choice in any form is a good thing if it lets parents make decisions about what is best for their kids. “Most Americans have that already,” Oberndorf said in an interview. “They have that if they have enough money to move to a good school district or send their kids to private school. It’s really only poor people who don’t have choices.” In a statement to the AP, a representative of the Waltons said the family is concerned about improving education quality for all children. It is not focused so much on how that is done. “There have always been tensions in some quarters over the best ways to offer educational options to families,” said Marc Sternberg, senior education adviser to the Walton family. “School choice is a means to an end and not the end in itself. It is about making sure those options — including schools within traditional school systems — offer the kinds of high quality, diverse educational opportunities so that every child has a real chance to succeed in life.” Other wealthy school-choice funders are adamant about improving the public education system and combatting any effort that would take tax dollars away from it. They object to being grouped with the supporters of private-school vouchers. Nick Hanauer, a Seattle investor who had an early stake in Amazon and who spent $1 million in 2012 to support a successful ballot measure to allow charters in Washington state, called vouchers “a stupid idea.” Consider that in the most elite private schools across the country, tuition runs $30,000 to $40,000 a year, he said. “No voucher program is a $40,000-per-year program. It’s a $10,000-per-year program, or a $6,000-per-year program, which means that voucher advocates aren’t serious about delivering high-quality education,” he said. “They’re simply interested in making it cheaper for people who already send their kids to private school to continue to do this.” DeVOS DEEPENS DIVIDE The schism between wealthy funders over private-school vouchers became visible earlier this year during the confirmation process for DeVos, a billionaire heiress who was nominated by Trump for education secretary despite having no experience as a teacher or school administrator. DeVos attended private religious schools in Michigan. Her children were homeschooled and attended religious schools. Broad, a charter school advocate who has contributed at least $3.7 million since 2007 to political efforts to expand charters, wrote a letter to senators urging them to reject DeVos, calling her “unprepared and unqualified.” With DeVos at the helm of the Education Department, “much of the good work that has been accomplished to improve public education for all of America’s children could be undone,” wrote Broad, who declined to be interviewed by the AP. DeVos was confirmed only when Vice President Mike Pence cast the vote to break a 50-50 tie in the Senate. Overstock founder Patrick Byrne, who spent nearly $3 million on a failed 2007 Utah ballot initiative promoting vouchers, said DeVos was an “A-plus.” Venture capitalist Timothy Draper, who put $23 million behind a failed attempt to bring vouchers to California in 2000, also had high praise for her. “Having someone who really understands choice in education and how helpful that can be … is going to be good for education,” Draper said. The sides have been at odds previously, including in Arizona, where in April lawmakers passed and the governor signed a law to expand a voucher program. DeVos’s American Federation for Children made a total of $500,000 in independent political expenditures in 2014 and 2016. The anti-voucher Stand for Children spent $1 million in the state during that span. The Trump administration has not released any details about a voucher plan. But early this month, Trump asked lawmakers to work with him to extend school choice to millions more children, including low-income Hispanics and blacks “who deserve the same chance as every other child to live out their dreams and fill up their hearts and be educated at the top, top level.” The outline in his budget proposal calls for $1.4 billion in school-choice initiatives, including $250 million to launch a voucher program. That money would come in part from cutting $9 billion from K-12 education, including teacher training and after-school and summer programs. The Trump budget calls for eventually increasing annual school-choice funding by $20 billion. In her first major policy address as education secretary, DeVos said allowing parents to decide where their children will be educated is essential, whether they choose homeschooling, traditional schools, magnets, charters, online schools or private schools. “I think that the first and most important measure of accountability to the public is to the parents in general, right?” said DeVos.

Jared Walter, 30, has terrorized the community Portland, Oregon for eight years years, and was arrested for the fourth time on Wednesday night after several 911 callers reported sightings of him. Walter - who also has a history of gluing and masturbating into women's hair while on the city's  buses - has been charged with harassment and interfering with public transportation. 'It's unusual activity, pretty disturbing, pretty invasive,' Portland Police Sgt. Pete Simpson told KATU. 'It's someone who we want caught, someone off the streets. We don't want to ride on transit and be in the community.'   His actions left members of the community in Portland, Oregon afraid to use public transportation but they bound together to catch him after a reward of $1,000 was offered to anyone who had information about him  The first report of Walter - a registered sex offender - came on May 1 after a woman accused him of cutting out locks of her hair with a scissors. 'I see this person really close in my space, so I turned around, and said ‘what the hell are you doing?’, the victim told KGW. 'And I see coming, out of the edge of his hoodie are a pair of scissors. So, I start screaming at him. Are you cutting my hair?!' His actions left many afraid to ride Portland's public buses - controlled by Tri-County Metropolitan Transportation District of Oregon, which is also called Trimet - and a reward of $1,000 was offered to anyone who had information about him. Jared Walter, 30, has been accused of secretly cutting off bundles of women's hair while riding public buses A vigilant community member, Christian Coats, recognized Walter - also known in the local community as 'Trimet Barber'-  on Wednesday night while shopping at his local Walmart with his seven-year-old son, KGW reported. Coats followed Walter after dropping his son with a family member. 'I didn't want him to come with me when I’m chasing bad guys. Not yet, anyway. He doesn't have his cape on!' Coats said.  Coats spent an hour and a half chasing Walter, whose hair was shaved himself, around the neighborhood. During this time, other community members who had spotted him were also closely following him. But it was Coats who finally caught the Trimet Barber near a park. Speaking about the moment he caught him Coats said: 'He’s like, "I surrender, I give up, please don't hurt me," he was ready to give up by the time I cornered him. 'When you got people like that out there, he’s a sex offender, you gotta get him. You have all that adrenaline. I knew I had to get that guy.'  Coats called the police who took Walter into custody at the Multnomah County Detention Center, where he's being held on $8,000 bail, according to jail records. In 2010, Walter was imprisoned for 14 months in prison for cutting and gluing women's hair on public buses around Portland.  Vigilant community member Christian Coats recognized Walter at his local Walmart. He then followed and cornered him until the police arrived to arrest him on Wednesday night RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Murder squad detective who lied about being harassed by her...

He was sentenced to two years in prison but was released in July 2014. In the same year of his release, Walter was arrested after he cut the hair of a woman he followed into a dollar store.  'We will not tolerate this type of behavior on our transit system,' said TriMet safety director Harry Saporta.  'As this individual has clearly shown he will continue to re-offend despite repercussions, we will work closely with transit police and the district attorney's office to find this individual and seek the harshest penalty possible.' Saporta said the Trimet agency is considering banning Walter in the long-term, although violators typically receive a maximum of six months suspension.   Walter is due in court this week.            Read more: katu.com/news/lo...

 The Census Bureau could be in crisis — here's why it should matter to you Eric Pianin, The Fiscal Times May 12, 2017, 10:07 PM 1,145 facebook linkedin twitter email print A fence surrounds the US Department of Commerce in Washington October 5, 2013. Mike Theiler/Reuters A humdrum bureaucratic hiccup within the Commerce Department could have a direct and profound impact on future elections, allocations of billions of dollars in federal funding, policy making at the federal, state and local levels and corporate decision making. The long-smoldering controversy over funding and upgrading the 2020 census flared up this week, with potentially adverse implications for the country unless the Trump administration can straighten out the mess. The controversy, including the unexpected announced retirement of Census Director John Thompson and mounting costs that exceed the billions already budgeted, has been overshadowed by the firestorm over Trump's firing of FBI director James B. Comey. The decennial census unquestionably is one of the most important functions of the Commerce Department's Census Bureau – a laborious and often highly imprecise operation mandated by the Constitution. That's because the census generates vital information and data for the nation that is used — among other things — to reapportion the 435 seats in the House of Representatives, realign the boundaries of legislative districts in every state, and provide invaluable social, demographic and economic profiles of the country essential in developing public policy and conducting research. "It's enormously important," said Andrew Reamer, a research professor at George Washington University's public policy institute and an expert on demographics. "It's hard to overstate its importance." Arguably, the political implications of the census are the most consequential, Reamer said, because it "provides the foundation for our democracy." Every 10 years, after the Census Bureau finishes counting the population, some states gain House seats, and others lose them, reflecting faster growth in some state and declining populations in other areas. Reapportionment is a zero-sum game: faster-growing states pick up more House seats while states in decline lose representation. After the last census, for example, 10 states in the Northeast and Midwest lost a dozen seats while eight states in the South, Southwest, and far West picked up a corresponding number. Drew Hallowell / Stringer / Getty Images As one prime example, New York went from having 45 House members in the 1940s to only 27 following the 2010 Census, as the state's population steadily declined, according to an NBC News analysis. At the same time, Florida's representation in the House has grown from a mere six members in the 1940 to 27 today, enough to match the Gotham State's influence on Capitol Hill. State legislatures use the new census data to draw new boundaries for congressional and state legislative seats, a process that invariably strengthens the party in control of the state legislature or the governorship. The once-every-ten-year recount of the nation's population also carries important implication for presidential politics, because it determines the number of Electoral College votes that each state receives. That distribution proved to be crucial in the 2016 presidential election: President Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton in the all-important Electoral College vote, 304 to 227 while trailing her in the popular vote by nearly three million votes. The data is also used by the federal government in allocating billions of dollars in federal financial assistance to state and local governments for highways construction, social services, grants and other assistance. For instance, census data is used in deciding how more than $400 billion a year is allocated for projects like new hospitals and schools. That amounts to more than $4 trillion over a 10-year period for an array of construction projects and services throughout the country. The bulk of census-guided federal assistance is funneled to state governments through a handful of large formula grant programs, to aid low-income families and support highway infrastructure. Medicaid alone accounts for 58 percent of census-guided funding, a Brookings Institution analysis found. Census data provides key benchmarks for federal enforcement of civil rights and anti-discrimination laws and court decisions. Census data is also critical to informing government policymakers at the federal, state and local levels, especially in deciding how to divvy up federal assistance for social safety net programs, roads, bridges, mass transit and a plethora of other activities. Scholars, researchers, the Federal Reserve, the Council of Economic Advisers, congressional aides and others make exhaustive use of census data in studying the economy and looking for leading indicators of change. And businesses and corporations of all stripes and sizes – from Walmart to Seven-Eleven to small, independent enterprises -- rely on census data to determine where to locate new establishments and size up the available workforce. AP Photo/Alex Brandon The 2010 Decennial Census proved to be a costly and extremely rocky enterprise. Chaotic operations and mounting staff needs drove the budget through the roof. Moreover, plans for census takers to use state-of-the-art, hand-held devices to record data in the field had to be scrapped when the devices proved unreliable. The Census Bureau scrambled to hire and train thousands of more workers to use paper forms. "If the census count is inaccurate, then we have a problem in democracy, in the functioning of the economy, and in the wise and appropriate use of government funding," Reamer said. This year, the planning for the 2020 census is in shambles, with the sudden departure of Thompson, a highly regarded veteran of the complicated head-counting system, and his deputy. Wilbur Ross, the Commerce Secretary, said that an acting director would be chosen from existing staff by the end of next month. However, the agency has clashed with Congress over funding. One of the agency's biggest problems is trying to fulfill a congressional mandate to spend no more on the 2020 operation than the $12.5 billion it spent in 2010 – despite rising costs and a larger population to count. The Wall Street Journal reported that a key Census Bureau initiative to modernize its data system has already run far over budget. The main data system being developed is currently estimated to cost $965 million, or $309 million more than a previous projection. The Government Accountability Office recently said that it doesn't consider the Census Bureau's latest estimate "reliable," and has added the agency to its list of "high-risk" government operations. Over the past three years, the GAO has made 30 recommendations to help the Bureau design and implement a more cost-effective census for 2020. So far, only six of them had been fully implemented as of January. This story was originally published by  The Fiscal Times.

Updated: May 13, 2017 @ 12:54 am Full Forecast top right promo - flex2 Home News Local News Close Zeigler CEDA: The jobs are there, but the housing isn't Brian Todd, btodd@postbulletin.com Brian Todd Regional Reporter May 12, 2017 Updated 3 hrs ago (…) Zeigler DODGE CENTER — While Ron Zeigler was touting the success of another year at Community and Economic Development Associates, he also talked about how the anticipated growth of the region presents some big challenges. "Workforce and housing kind of go hand-in-hand," said Zeigler, president and CEO of CEDA, the economic development corporation that works on behalf of many of the small towns in Southeast Minnesota, While construction might be booming in Rochester, smaller cities have yet to see an increase in housing construction. Finding affordable housing for a growing workforce will be a major focus for cities, counties and groups that assist them, like CEDA. "These smaller communities are trying to draw people," Zeigler said. "You need housing for the people, but you need people ready (to rent or buy) to build the housing. What comes first, the housing or the people." Randal Hemmerlin, executive director of the Red Wing Housing Redevelopment Authority, said the lack of market-rate housing is due to a variety of reasons. The housing downturn in 2008 ground building to a halt and had the added impact of driving many developers and construction companies out of business. "We lost the infrastructure for building," he said. In fact, the city has just started adding affordable housing. "We just built our first market-rate apartment building in 25 years," he said, referring to the 60-unit apartment building going up near the city's Walmart. Still, that is just a drop in the bucket of need for Red Wing. It's an issue that extends across the region, said Gary Gooder, president of manufacturing company Alum-Line in Cresco, Iowa. Gooder, a member of the CEDA board of directors — CEDA also serves communities in western Wisconsin and northern Iowa — said the housing issues being faced in Southeast Minnesota are the same as those in his community. "We only have about 20 percent of our employees living locally," he said. "The biggest missing elements are apartments for young people and transitional housing for older people." The latter, he said, isn't assisted living but a downsized dwelling that allows empty-nesters to move out of their four-bedroom, three-bath house and open that space for a middle-age family that's still stuck in a starter home. Like most communities, Gooder said Cresco has completed several housing studies since 2000, and the results are always the same. "We need about 40 transitional units for older people, and 40 affordable apartment units," he said. "I'd tell the developers out there, you're missing a valuable niche in rural communities." Hemmerlin noted how the housing study in Red Wing showed that based on the job market, workers can afford about $1,100 a month in rents for affordable housing. But, he said, with the variety of businesses that anchor Red Wing's economy, he thinks that number should be higher, and a little more in line with what developers have said they would need to make a profit on new construction. "I think people will be able to afford $1,300 rents," he said. "You get a couple living together, they're used to paying these rents. They want good housing." What's your reaction?

Jennifer Laplante was charged with child endangerment, and fraudulent schemes and artifices after she allegedly returned tampered formula to as many as four stores before it went back on the shelf, police said. She allegedly did this with Gerber “Good Start” Soy formula. The case stretches back to May 5, when Tucson police officers responded to a baby that had “possibly ingested contaminated formula.” Police learned that the baby didn’t have any life-threatening injuries and possibly became sick because of a formula product that was purchased at a Fry’s Food and Drug store.

The store cards promise deep discounts on clothing, furniture and electronics, and are tough for shoppers to resist. For some retailers, those credit cards are not just a sales tool, but also an essential way to bolster their struggling businesses — a trend that has worrisome implications for the industry and its customers. The store cards, with interest rates that are often twice those of the average credit card, are a rich profit source for retailers at a time when many stores are losing the battle for sales to Amazon and other e-commerce rivals. The profit on plastic helps obscure the true extent of the industry’s pain, a major pressure point for a piece of the economy that employs 1 in 10 Americans. Weak consumer spending, digital competition and changing shopping habits have already roiled retailers. In recent months, the industry has shed tens of thousands of workers. Latest business videos But the businesses may be in worse shape than they appear, since store cards are a shaky foundation. If more consumers fall behind on their payments, the profits could dry up, intensifying retailers’ troubles. The reliance on profits from store cards is stark at some retailers. At Macy’s, the money from branded credit cards accounted for 39 percent of the company’s total profit of $1.9 billion last year, up from 26 percent in 2013, according to an analysis by Morgan Stanley. Bloomingdale’s, which is owned by Macy’s, has pushed to increase the number of credit card customers that workers are expected to sign up each month, according to the store workers’ union. At Kohl’s, the profit from plastic totaled 35 percent, up from 23 percent, over that same period. At Target, it made up 13 percent of total earnings, up from 11 percent in 2013. Amazon, by comparison, derives only about 3 percent of its total income from its credit cards. The cracks are starting to show. As signs of customer distress rise, one major lender, Synchrony Financial, which handles the credit cards for Sam’s Club, Gap, Toys R Us and others, is setting aside more money for bad loans. “Investors may not appreciate the magnitude of the retailers’ stress” because of income from store cards, said Kimberly Greenberger, a retail analyst at Morgan Stanley. Shoppers have been using store credit ever since the early 1900s, when department stores issued “charge plates” — small metal cards embossed with the customer’s name and address that were often kept behind the counter. Today, it is virtually impossible to go into a store without getting an offer. J. Crew offers those who sign up 15 percent off their first purchase, while Home Depot offers one year of “hassle-free” returns for card holders. A Macy’s card offers savings of up to $100 for a two-day shopping spree. At first, the cards can seem appealing to customers with limited budgets, allowing them to finance purchases they might not otherwise be able to afford. But the retailers make much of their money on interest charges, so they are counting on many customers going into debt. “These stores are propping up their failing businesses on the backs of lower-middle-class people,” said Charles Juntikka, a bankruptcy lawyer in New York, whose clients often have rung up thousands of dollars in debt on retail cards. Lillian Esposito of Queens accumulated at least 10 different credit cards, including ones from Toys R Us and Walmart. The mother of two young boys, she used them to buy school supplies and Christmas gifts, taking advantage of store discounts on the cards. But any savings quickly evaporate when borrowers cannot pay their bills right away. As Esposito watched her balances grow every month, she calculated paying $25 on interest for every $100 she spent. And she fell behind on some payments. She has since sworn off big retailers. “Never again,” she said. Synchrony Financial, which issued some of Esposito’s cards, declined to comment on her experience. But spokesman Samuel Wang said the company “takes into account a customer’s ability to pay” and encourages customers in distress to contact the lender. Toys R Us said terms of its cards are similar to others. In some cases, customers end up owing more in interest than the original bill. Many store cards carry rates around 30 percent. “It’s like fool’s gold,” said Bryan Hall, who lives in the Bronx. Hall, 48, charged thousands of dollars on cards from P.C. Richard, Best Buy and Kay Jewelers, for an iPad, a 46-inch television and a ring for a friend who was getting married. He then sold off items he bought to pay his rent and keep his car on the road. He stopped making payments on several cards. Kay Jewelers and Best Buy declined to comment on Hall. P.C. Richard did not respond to requests for comment. The credit cards allow retailers to make money from their vast networks of physical stores, even as sales at those locations fall. To make up the gap, some companies are putting more pressure on their workers to sign up accounts. The payoff for employees is low. Workers at some stores earn as little as $1 for each new account they open, and the discounts that their customers get for signing up for a card cut into the employees’ sales commissions. At Bloomingdale’s, the company’s proposal to increase the credit card enrollment was a sticking point in recent contract negotiations, according to the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union. A company spokeswoman, Cheryl Heinonen, said credit card enrollments are only one aspect in employee evaluations, but declined to discuss the confidential negotiations. Heinonen added that the company is comfortable with its store cards, noting that card holders are among Macy’s “most loyal and happiest customers.” Citigroup, which issues the Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s cards, declined to comment. Credit card profit could prove a fleeting lifeline for retailers. When customers fall behind or default, the banks are likely to clamp down on extending new cards, meaning that source of income for retailers can quickly evaporate. Christian Buss, a retail analyst at Credit Suisse, said credit card profits are a “temporary subsidy” that the industry could not count on over the long term. The problems are already starting to appear. After enjoying several years of low defaults, Synchrony surprised investors in late April by announcing that it had to put aside a larger cushion for loan losses than many analysts expected. The stock sank 16 percent in one day. Among the company’s struggling borrowers was Jose Luis Garcia, a 75-year-old whose only income is from Social Security. In August, Garcia went into a furniture dealer in Brooklyn planning to buy a box spring for $100 in cash. But after the aggressive sales pitch, he came out with a full bed set, totaling $2,041, including delivery. The purchase was charged to a Synchrony card, which he says he never wanted. Unable to keep up with interest payments of 30 percent, Garcia sought legal assistance from New Economy Project, a nonprofit group that helps low-income New Yorkers. After an inquiry from the New York Times, Synchrony said it looked into the matter and forgave his debt. “They took me for an idiot,” Garcia said.

Shoppers are looking for bargains online, department stores are struggling, and once-mainstay brands are closing permanently. Then there is Stitch Fix, a mail-order clothing service that offers customers little choice in what garments they receive, and shies away from discounts for brand name dresses, pants and accessories. Despite a business model that seems to defy conventional wisdom, Stitch Fix continues to grow. For the fiscal year that ended in July, the company recorded sales of $730 million. It has been profitable since 2014 and has raised just $42 million from outside investors, a relatively modest sum for a high-flying Silicon Valley startup. Latest business videos And while Stitch Fix executives say they have no specific plans to go public, the company is well positioned to file for an initial public offering as soon as this year. Should Stitch Fix go public, it would be the biggest retail offering since Etsy two years ago. Perhaps more important, it would be a Silicon Valley rarity: a profitable company that did not raise money at a sky-high valuation, and one that could potentially tap the public markets at a price many times greater than its current value. Stitch Fix is not the first company to try this business model. Similar startups, from clothing rival Trunk Club to cosmetics specialist Birchbox, have found a market mailing consumers a grab bag of items and offering free returns for anything unwanted. But many such startups have had trouble keeping costs down, and customers around. Nordstrom, which bought Trunk Club in 2014 for a reported $350 million, wrote down nearly $200 million from the business’ value last year. “Those businesses have mostly struggled to grow and remain profitable over a long period of time,” said Mark Cohen, a professor at Columbia Business School who previously served as CEO of Sears Canada. “Will a loyalist want to receive this every month? Is anyone interested in consuming this much apparel and accessories?” So far, Stitch Fix has found success where other online clothing startups have struggled. To the company’s founder, Katrina Lake, success comes down to delivering what consumers want: making it easier to shop. “There’s been a lot of innovation around being the cheapest or fastest,” she said in an interview at a Stitch Fix warehouse in South San Francisco. In her view, what was important was helping customers find clothing they liked without taking lengthy shopping trips and returning dozens of items. Stitch Fix was founded in 2011 and was initially run out of Lake’s apartment in Cambridge, Mass. At first the company catered only to women, but has since expanded to offer men’s clothing, plus sizes and maternity wear. Each box contains a handful of selections from trendy brands like Citizens of Humanity, Scotch & Soda and Barbour. Up next is a luxury level featuring clothes from higher-end labels like Theory, with prices from $150 to about $500 per item. Expansion plans like that drive home the diverging fortunes of struggling traditional retailers and fast-growing online rivals. Online retailers who sell luxury products for less are undercutting sales at high-end department stores like Neiman Marcus. Nordstrom recently announced layoffs and told investors it plans to focus on e-commerce, despite its Trunk Club write-down. And J. Crew, which has hundreds of stores around the country, has suffered three straight years of losses and is deeply in debt. While early e-commerce startups like One Kings Lane, Gilt Groupe and Fab were failures for investors, the category has picked up steam in the past few years as traditional retailers have looked to startups to lift their businesses. Walmart bouth Jet for $3 billion. Last year, the subscription razor service Dollar Shave Club was sold to Unilever for $1 billion. And the online pet store Chewy.com was acquired by PetSmart, reportedly for more than $3 billion. Some startups have also moved away from models that compete for customers on price or rely on fads, like flash sales. Stitch Fix’s pitch is straightforward enough: Trust the company to pick out your tops, bottoms, shoes or accessories for you. When customers sign up, they fill out an extensive form detailing style preferences, clothing needs and price points. The startup’s algorithms then churn out a set of potential choices, which one of its 3,400 stylists — most of them part time — then tailors to the individual customer before sending out five items in a package. Customers receive a 25 percent discount if they buy everything in the box, and anything they do not want can be returned free. At the company’s warehouse, Eric Colson, formerly a top data scientist at Netflix, spoke to the role that data science — once the province of high-tech giants — plays in nearly every aspect of the Stitch Fix business. Colson excitedly illustrated on whiteboards how the company’s systems can narrow down a broad range of women’s pants to a relative few that each individual customer is statistically likely to keep. “Customers say, ‘This thing you picked out for me, I would never have picked it out for myself,’” he said. Algorithms have even cut the number of steps needed for workers to pick out clothes for individual clients. “Some people call this the ‘Moneyball’ of fashion,” said Bill Gurley of the venture capital firm Benchmark, who sits on Stitch Fix’s board. “The level of data science done at this company ... is incomparable.” But that data-driven approach has also been yoked to Lake’s insistence on running a financially healthy company. Given her early troubles raising money from outside investors, Lake worked toward becoming profitable early. “We had a ‘lean plan’ and a ‘lean-lean plan,’” she said. Stitch Fix declined to say what percentage of items are returned. Running so cheaply meant not taking out ads during Stitch Fix’s early days. But word of mouth helped the company grow — and eventually drew investors like Gurley, whose interest was piqued by the number of assistants at his firm who swore by the service. Yet the question remains whether customers who are initially thrilled by receiving a custom box of clothing will remain customers for months or even years. Lauren Rivellino, an optometrist in Charlotte, Va., was a Stitch Fix enthusiast when she subscribed in 2015. She loved trying clothes on at home rather than in a poorly lit dressing room, and most items were flattering and reflected her style. But a year later, Rivellino stopped using the service. “I really have nothing bad to say about them,” she said in a recent email. “I just don’t shop a lot.” Stitch Fix executives declined to share their retention statistics, but claim that they are above industry averages. Lake and Colson acknowledged that clients stop using the service for a variety of reasons, from dissatisfaction to their closets simply filling up. But the two also say that the company can analyze scores of data points to figure out ways to coax these customers back to the fold.

Live Watch Ex-teacher who allegedly kidnapped teen to remain in jail until trial By JENN LEONG EMILY SHAPIRO Close Follow on Twitter More from Emily JULIA JACOBO Close Follow on Twitter More from Julia May 12, 2017, 7:12 PM ET 0 Shares Email Star PlaySiskiyou County Sheriff WATCH Timeline of events: Tad Cummins' time on the run with student Elizabeth Thomas 0 Shares Email The former Tennessee teacher who authorities say kidnapped his 15-year-old student then spent over a month on the run with her will remain in jail until his trial, a judge decided today. Tad Cummins, 50, a married father and grandfather, went missing with 15-year-old Elizabeth Thomas on March 13, authorities said. An Amber Alert was issued for Elizabeth, and Cummins was wanted on allegations of aggravated kidnapping and sexual contact with a minor. The two were found in northern California on April 20; the teen was "healthy and unharmed," authorities said and Cummins was taken into custody. Prosecutors allege that Cummins, who is accused of transporting a minor in interstate commerce with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, planned to flee to Mexico with the teen. Cummins did not enter a plea. His attorney, Dumaka Shabazz, said that while Cummins’ family does not condone the allegations against him, they are still providing "moral" and "emotional" support. "I believe there's a lot of questions that have been unanswered," he said. "We will follow up on those until we get to the bottom of this case." Shabazz added that he does not believe Cummins is a flight risk. An FBI agent told the court today that on March 12, the day before the pair disappeared, Cummins told his wife, Jill Cummins, that he had a job interview and needed to borrow her car. Jill Cummins agreed to swap cars, but became concerned the next day while at work and waiting for her husband to bring back the vehicle. She then called the medical center where Cummins said he was going for a job interview, but the center knew nothing about it. Jill Cummins and her daughter then headed home and found a note, the agent said, and also noticed that Cummins' clothes, two handguns, and loan money he had claimed to have taken out to pay bills were missing. Cummins and Elizabeth first fled to Alabama, where they reportedly threw their phones into the Tennessee River. The agent said they then went to Mississippi, where they spent their first night on the run, and then Oklahoma -- where they were caught on surveillance video at a local Walmart. The pair stayed at Super 8 motels in each city, the FBI agent said, and Cummins used his real driver's license when checking in each time. In Colorado the duo used aliases of John and Joanne Castro and told strangers they were married, the agent said. They used the fake names because they hoped to go to Mexico and the last name sounds Hispanic, according to the agent. Cummins and Elizabeth then spent one night in Canyon City, Colorado and another night in Cortez, Colorado, the agent said. They were spotted on surveillance cameras at a Walmart in Cortez, where Cummins is seen buying a tablet computer to monitor the news coverage of their disappearance. Cummins said he became sad after seeing a plea from his wife, according to the agent. The two then went to Utah for three to four nights, before heading to Nevada for one night and then on to Southern California. The FBI agent said the ex-teacher and teen then headed to southern California where they bought a two-person kayak for $1,500. They planned to kayak to Mexico after doing a dry run in the Coronado Bay. There, the two engaged with a police officer. Cummins thought they would be caught, the agent said. But the officer was simply worried about the pair, and didn't realize who they were. Cummins was certain they would be captured if they attempted to travel to Mexico by land, but still he sold the kayak to someone at a bar in Los Angeles for $400 and the two then went to Slab City, California, where they stayed at a commune for one night. Cummins was concerned for his safety there and slept with his gun, the agent said. The two left Slab City the following day, and authorities ultimately located them in northern California about two weeks later. Ex-teacher who allegedly kidnapped teen planned to run to Mexico, prosecutors say Missing teen, ex-teacher spotted at Oklahoma Wal-Mart 2 days after disappearance Ex-teacher accused of kidnapping teen believed to have watched TV show about living off the grid: Sources Weeks before a student and teacher went missing, another teen reported seeing them kiss Cummins, who was fired one day after the alleged kidnapping, had reportedly researched teen marriage online, specifically the age of consent, according to law enforcement officials. One of Elizabeth's schoolmates reported seeing her and Cummins kiss in his classroom on Jan. 23, according to a school district investigative report, but both denied this claim. A school report from January said neither one "admitted to behaving inappropriately towards the other." Elizabeth’s father, Anthony Thomas, told ABC News after Elizabeth was found, “She may not be exactly ... the person she was because there’s a lot of experiences she’s had." "I think she has the determination to really go somewhere in life," he said. "But right now she really needs a lot of help." 0 Shares Email Star Comments " Ex-teacher who allegedly kidnapped teen to remain in jail until trial " Comey will not testify next week but Rosenstein to brief Senate on firing " What Trump says Comey told him about being cleared " More Americans disapprove of Comey's firing than approve, poll shows " Police chief killed in Ohio was father of 6 Shortlist to replace Comey includes former NYPD commissioner " Michelle Obama criticizes Trump school lunch decision " At least 3 dead in latest Ebola outbreak " Judge: Corrupt ex-LA sheriff's crimes an 'embarrassment' " Senator says Trump 'may be obstructing justice' " Fashion designer Carolina Herrera's nephew killed in Caracas " 5 immigrant women vie for Miss USA pageant title " Newlyweds reunited with lost wedding rings after Texas tornado " Soccer coach comes out to team as transgender: 'I'm still me' " Why the 'exercise pill' isn't likely to eliminate the gym any time soon " New dinosaur named after 'Ghostbusters' monster " Texan Richard Overton, the oldest US WWII vet, turns 111 " Eighth-graders help create 3D prosthetic hand for farmer " 7 siblings adopted together after years in foster care " Dog named Huckleberry becomes star for hanging out on owners' roof " Shelter in search of forever home for 'saddest dog in the world' for the final time " 90-year-old grandpa serves as best man at grandson's wedding " Paralyzed mom hangs off cliff in Mother's Day photo shoot " How two moms are celebrating Mother's Day with their 1st child " Undocumented mother granted temporary stay on deportation after 86 days in sanctuary " US prepares to ban laptops on flights from Europe " Ex-prep school official, Teacher of Year admits sex assault " Pope cheered in Fatima to honor children who urged peace " Sister says Arkansas slaying suspect battled mental illness " Astronauts ace station's 200th spacewalk, shortened by leak " Hundreds pay final respects to slain Boston doctors " Ram pickup air bags can fail in rollover; 1 death reported " China, US reach agreement on beef, poultry and natural gas " United flight delayed after scorpion reported aboard " Russian fighter flies 20 feet from Navy plane over Black Sea " Coroner to reopen case into 8-year-old's hanging after school releases video " 'Dance Moms' star talks new show after prison sentence " New 'exoskeleton' technology can help protect seniors from slips and falls " GOP lawmaker cautions health care bill is Obamacare 'tweak' " John McAfee, from tech pioneer to 'person of interest' in a murder case to presidential candidate " Music Review: Harry Styles looks to past icons on solo debut " J.K.

(Submitted by Prince Albert Police Service) Related Stories Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations urges Sask. to wear red for missing and murdered Statue honouring missing and murdered Indigenous women unveiled in Saskatoon It's difficult for Regina Poitras to speak about her plans for Mother's Day this weekend. Her daughter Happy Charles, 42, has been missing from Prince Albert, Sask., since April 3. Poitras is also worried about Charles's four daughters and one son — her own grandchildren — as they prepare for what would usually be a family celebration. "Me and her kids miss her, her family misses her, we all love her, and Mother's Day's coming up and the kids are just, they seem like they are very sad," she said. Police investigation continues Police say they're still investigating Charles's disappearance and they have searched the areas surrounding her last known locations. Poitras and other members of Charles's family have been running their own search for information on weekends.  Happy Charles has been missing for five weeks since she was last sighted in Prince Albert on April 3. (Submitted by Regina Poitras) They've scoured the city's trails, handing out flyers and questioning people in search of clues that might lead them to her. But Poitras said they are no closer to the truth. As she puts it, the trail has gone cold. "There has to be somebody who's seen her somewhere," said Poitras. "She can't just be gone. "The police said they had a few tips but those didn't turn up anything." What they have learned is how well-liked Charles was in her circle of friends in Prince Albert, which is about 135 kilometres northeast of Saskatoon.  Although Charles sometimes went up to four days without contacting her mother, Poitras said it was unlike her daughter to go without contact any longer than that. Movements prior to disappearance  Poitras said Charles had left her home in La Ronge, Sask., where Poitras also lives, to go to Prince Albert to do banking on April 1.  On the evening of April 2, Poitras said her daughter messaged her to say she was at the Prince Albert Inn. And on April 3, she said video footage shows Charles at the city's Walmart with her boyfriend. She is also believed to have been at the YWCA before her disappearance. Search could be bigger, says family Although police say they have searched the parts of the city where she was known to have been, Poitras said the search could be bigger. She would like to see an aerial search for her daughter, who she said was a popular and outgoing woman. "She was very well-loved by her daughters and by us, and her son," said Poitras.   Happy Charles, 42, travelled from her home in La Ronge, Sask., to Prince Albert, Sask., to do some banking on April 1. She has not been seen since April 3. (Submitted by Prince Albert Police Service) "She talks with everybody and is friendly with everybody and with us she's a loving person and she would never worry us for anything. She'd let us know if she was out there." Charles is described as being five feet three inches tall, weighing about 110 pounds with brown hair and brown eyes. She has a tattoo of a rose on her left hand and a scar on her left cheek. Anyone with information is asked to contact the Prince Albert Police Service at 306-953-4222 or Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-8477.

The blast was linked to a pipeline running from a nearby well. Credit YouTube channel Cataclysmic Listen Listening... / 5:17 On the afternoon of April 17th, 10-year-old Gillian Chapman and her little sister Kailey were on their front porch. Gillian had on her roller blades; Kailey had her scooter. They had just gotten permission to go visit their friend Jaelynn, across the street and two doors down. Then, Jaelynn’s house exploded. “The house just split open,” Gillian said. “You could see the upstairs.” Jaelynn Martinez was not in her home at the time, but her father Mark and uncle Joey Irwin were in the basement and were killed in the blast. Her mother, Erin Martinez was injured. The explosion, in the northern Colorado town of Firestone, is prompting a lot of questions in the state about how oil and gas wells are regulated, and how close to old wells new homes should be built. The incident was linked to a leaking gas line running from a well 178 feet from the property. The fatal Oak Meadows home explosion occurred in an area with many wells that had been drilled in the 1990s, indicated by orange markers. In this time-lapse aerial view, from 1999 through 2015 new housing developments encroach upon the old wells. Data sources: COGCC, Google Earth. Credit Jordan Wirfs-Brock / Inside Energy     Within days after the incident, Governor John Hickenlooper ordered statewide inspections of all such lines, called flow lines, within 1,000 feet of occupied buildings within 30 days. Right now, there is no comprehensive state map showing where flow lines exist. Julia Chapman said when they bought their house a couple of years ago, neighboring oil and gas sites just weren’t something they thought about. “We just sort of trusted that the city and the oil and gas (industry) knew what they were doing,” she said. Matt Lepore is Director of Colorado’s Oil & Gas Conservation Commission. At a press conference, he called the explosion “highly unusual.”  He says the state is looking very hard at the issue and is taking steps  “to absolutely minimize any possibility of this happening again.” Colorado’s population has increased by a half a million people since 2010 — bringing with it a lot of new home construction along the state’s clustered Front Range. Weld County, where Firestone is located, issued  more than 5000 new building permits in the last 2 years. The northern Front Range also happens to be where much of Colorado’s oil and gas production is located. State data show that there are now some 54,000 active oil and gas wells in the state, and another 80,000 or so inactive and abandoned wells.

Shortly after the accident, Anadarko Petroleum shut down 3,000 wells in the area. Regulators insist there is no more danger for the surrounding properties surrounding the Martinez home. “I would say (with the heightened scrutiny) we’re probably safer now than we’ve ever been,” Julia Chapman said. But, more new homes keep going up. And while new oil wells must be drilled at least 500 feet from homes and 1,000 feet from buildings like homes and schools, there is no state regulation for the inverse — no rule for how far new homes must be built from existing oil wells. When asked about whether the state should enact these so-called “reverse setbacks,” Northern Colorado Homebuilders Association Executive Officer Gregory Miedema said the industry would be willing discuss anything that would keep confidence in the home buying public. “What they want to make sure is they don’t price the public out of a new home,” he said, explaining that any new regulations could shrink land available for new home construction, thereby raise housing prices.

Related Content Filling In The Natural Gas Gaps By Amy Sisk • Apr 7, 2017 Amy Sisk/Inside Energy    With the fracking boom ushering in cheap natural gas prices nationwide, nearly 40 states have adopted or are considering new legislation to expand gas service. Big gaps exist in rural America where natural gas does not reach. These areas rely heavily on propane, with 12 million homes that use it for heating. One North Dakota town is looking to make the switch, pushing the Legislature for flexibility to craft its own plan to bring in natural gas service. What Happened In Midwest? The Mysterious Gas Leak That Shuttered A School By Stephanie Joyce • Nov 7, 2016 Stephanie Joyce For months, it has been eerily quiet at the Midwest School. Other than the skittering of leaves across the cordoned-off parking lot, the only sounds are the clink of the flagpole and the dog barking across the street. It’s been this way since May, when health officials closed down the 120-student K-12 school after detecting dangerous levels of toxic gases inside. Prices Must Come Up Before Crude Oil Production Does By Cooper McKim • May 10, 2017 Oil production continues to fall in Wyoming. The first records of the state’s production in 2017 show it’s down about 14% from the same time last year.  Oil and gas commissioner Tom Fitzsimmons said that decline is likely to continue. To stop it, prices would need to stabilize first around $55 per barrel while they have recently been between $46 and $48 per barrel. Fitzsimmons said prices are driven up if there's less supply, though that supply keeps on coming. He pointed to the state’s network of ducts.  Jonah Energy Buys Out Competitor For Control of Natural Gas Field By Cooper McKim • May 3, 2017 ecoflight.org Jonah Energy, a Colorado-based oil and gas company, will soon own nearly 100 percent of natural gas reserves in western Wyoming — the eighth largest natural gas field in the country. The investment is a vote of confidence in an industry that’s seen declining prices in recent years. Energy Economist Says Coal Isn't Coming Back By Caroline Ballard • Apr 22, 2017 Wikimedia Commons At a presentation at the University of Wyoming’s Energy Innovation Center, an energy economist argued that the coal industry will likely never recover to previous levels. That’s despite a small rebound in the first quarter of this year because of a cold winter.

You can thank Amazon for that. After years in which e-commerce seemed like an afterthought for many Canadian stores, more retailers are making the pricey investments in online shopping platforms that are needed to attend to a vast and sparely populated country. As Amazon steadily ramps up its own operations in Canada, local rivals are scrambling to avoid the same sort of fate that doomed many of their counterparts south of the border. "They can look at what's happening in the U.S., they can look at what's happening in other markets, and almost get a road map of realizing, 'This is going to happen to me, too, if I don't change my practices,'" said Robin Sherk, a Toronto-based director of digital and retail insights at consulting firm Kantar Retail. Retailers have a lot of catching up to do. Canadians spent $26.6 billion shopping online last year, or about $730 per capita, according to researcher eMarketer and Bloomberg calculations. That's far off from the $1,230 that U.S. consumers spent on average, and it masks a quirk in Canada's e-commerce network. Some prominent retailers, such as Canadian Tire, let buyers place their orders online, jump in their cars and pick up the goods themselves instead of having them delivered. That's where Amazon comes in. The e-commerce behemoth has opened a fulfilment centre every year in Canada since 2011, including the first automated facility outside of Toronto last year, as well as a new data centre near Montreal. It's also expanding the number of cities eligible for free one-day shipping as part of its $79-a-year Prime loyalty program. There's plenty of room to grow: Only about four per cent of Canada's primary household shoppers were Prime members as of May 2016, compared with 37 per cent in the U.S. as of December, said Kantar's Sherk. "Amazon is pushing a lot of traditional retail in Canada to up their game and offer better online shopping," said Paul Briggs, an analyst with eMarketer. A few Canadian retailers seem up for the challenge, and eMarketer forecasts online sales to surge 64 per cent by 2020. Hudson's Bay Co., owner of Saks Fifth Avenue, opened its own robotic facility in November to get online orders out faster. Women's clothing chain Reitmans has been closing stores and redesigning its distribution centre to support e-commerce sales, which rose 51 per cent last year. Canadian Tire's sporting-goods division, Sport Chek, is running a pilot for same-day delivery in the Toronto region, a direct challenge to Amazon's claim-to-fame. On Thursday, Canadian Tire said it will begin testing home delivery for its namesake stores later this year. The retailer said in February that e-commerce sales aren't yet having a meaningful impact on revenue growth in its stores. Well-known Canadian entrepreneur Alexandre Taillefer, whose electric-car fleet is going head-to-head with Uber in Montreal, is also mulling a plan. His private equity firm, XPND Capital, is trying to drum up support among local stores to band together and create a single platform to hock their wares, with ties to local media. "E-commerce in Quebec is behind, we don't have a major player like Walmart or Amazon. But we have relevant local players," he said. "Media are in a crisis, retailers are in a crisis; why not work all together for joint success?" While Amazon's big push into Canada definitely has retailers rattled, it doesn't necessarily portend the same sort of bloodbath that swept through the U.S. retail industry and caused a record number of bankruptcies. For one thing, Canada's shopping-mall square footage per capita is about 30 per cent less that in the U.S., suggesting there's not as much excess capacity. It's easy to see why e-commerce has been slower to catch on in Canada. The nation's 36 million people are spread out over nine million square kilometres, including hard-to-get-to and frigid regions, making logistics in the country considerably more costly and complicated than in the U.S. or U.K. That's one reason why some retailers with large networks of brick-and-mortar stores, such as Canadian Tire and grocer Loblaw Cos., have clients drop by to collect their online orders. Montreal-based Aldo Group, which sells shoes in more than 100 countries, goes a step further. Customers can order and receive goods anywhere, switching between online and in-store shopping as they wish as data on their tastes and habits make the two increasingly connected. "Retailers have to move fast," said Gregoire Baret, who oversees the so-called omni-channel strategy and a recently revamped e-commerce site at Aldo. "Sometimes Canadian markets are assessing what is going on in the U.S. before acting, which is great but which is also potentially a risk."

Macy's, Kohl's and Dillard's all reported lower sales for the last three months and missed Wall Street's forecasts. SOURCE: CNNMONEY/Shutterstock/Gwen Sung By Chris Isidore NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- America's long-standing love affair with shopping at malls and department stores may be nearing an end. "The traditional mall as we know it is doomed," said according to Greg Portell, a retail consultant at A.T. Kearney. "When was the last time a mall closed that people missed, other than people the people who worked there?" And retail workers are taking a huge hit. Between 2001 and 2016, jobs at traditional department stores fell 46%, according to Labor Department data. That's a much steeper drop than other troubled industries. For example, coal mining jobs dropped 32% during the same 15 years. Factory employment fell 25%. About 60% of department store employees are female, compared to 47% of workers overall. Minorities, the elderly and teenagers are also far more likely to find jobs in department and discount stores than they are elsewhere. Teenagers hold 8% of department store jobs, compared to 3% of jobs overall. "For the young, it's a rite of passage in learning how to work, how to deal with customers," said Amanda Nicholson, professor of retail practice at Syracuse University. Some 3,300 store closings have been announced so far this year, according to Fung Global Retail & Technology, a retail think tank. That's double the number in the same period in 2016. This year will likely see the largest number of store closings since the Great Recession, according to Portell. Further proof of the struggle stores face emerged this week. A raft of retail icons posted disappointing financial results: Macy's, JCPenney, Kohls, Dillards and Nordstrom. Each of them told the same grim tale about losing sales and market share as Americans shop elsewhere. The trouble isn't likely to end any time soon. Competition from online rivals like Amazon is continuing to intensify, and chains such as Walmart and Target are investing more money in online shopping, rather than in traditional stores. Americans are spending more money than ever shopping, according to government figures. But every retailer that reported financial results this week said that sales at stores open at least a year had declined from a year earlier. Some chains are struggling just to survive. Abercrombie & Fitch announced this week that it is looking for a buyer for the company. And the CEO of Sears Holdings, which owns the Sears and Kmart brands, told investors that vendors are treating the company "like a pariah" since it warned investors earlier this year it may not be able to stay in business. Sears Holdings warned investors in March that it can no longer promise it will remain in business. It is not in bankruptcy, but it has posted losses of more than $10 billion since 2010, and debt has soared while the value of its stock has tumbled. "There are some chains that are already obsolete and hanging on by a thread," said Marshall Cohen, chief industry analyst at NPD Group. TM & © 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

European equity markets, already in a more upbeat mood after France's market-friendly presidential election outcome last weekend, pushed higher after data showed the German economy expanded at a robust 0.6 percent in the first quarter, compared with the previous three months. The DAX index in Germany closed up 0.5 percent, while Paris rose 0.4 percent. The euro also advanced against the dollar, which fell on lackluster US economic data. Emmanuel Macron will be sworn in as French president on Sunday and is expected to line up a government the following day, giving a first indication of the outlook for his economic reform plans. Analysts have cheered his victory last Sunday. "Political uncertainties are either out of the way or have receded further," said analyst Florian Hense of Berenberg bank. London's benchmark FTSE 100 index reached a new record closing high as sterling weakness boosted the earnings outlook for big British exporters. In the US, both the Dow and S&P 500 finished lower after disappointing results from J.C. Penney and Nordstrom. Both of those department store chains fell steeply, while other retailers, including Wal-Mart Stores, Best Buy and Gap, posted smaller declines. - Nikkei retreats - Earlier in Asia, traders took a step back ahead of the weekend with confidence rattled by a series of below-par Chinese data and the lingering fallout of Donald Trump's shock firing of the head of the FBI, which some fear could lead to a crisis that will knock the president's economy-boosting agenda off center. AFP / Mandy Cheng Asian traders turned sellers after a strong run-up over the past week, spooked by a concerns over the US retail sector Tokyo's Nikkei index closed down 0.4 percent from a 17-month high, but Hong Kong rose 0.1 percent, extending a rally to five days. Bloomberg News reported, without naming sources, that China had made preparations to support the Hang Seng Index if needed ahead of the expected visit of President Xi Xinping to the city for the July 1 handover celebrations. Shanghai -- which has fallen about seven percent in the past month on worries about a state crackdown on leveraged investing -- ended up 0.7 percent with speculation mainland shares were also being given state backing. - Key figures around 2100 GMT - New York - Dow: DOWN 0.1 percent at 20,896.61 (close) New York - S&P 500: DOWN 0.2 percent at 2,390.90 (close) New York - Nasdaq: UP 0.1 percent at 6,121.23 (close) London - FTSE 100: UP 0.7 percent at 7,435.39 (close) Frankfurt - DAX 30: UP 0.5 percent at 12,770.41 (close) Paris - CAC 40: UP 0.4 percent at 5,405.42 (close) EURO STOXX 50: UP 0.4 percent at 3,637.52 Tokyo - Nikkei 225: DOWN 0.4 percent at 19,883.90 (close) Hong Kong - Hang Seng: UP 0.1 percent at 25,156.34 (close) Shanghai - Composite: UP 0.7 percent at 3,083.51 (close) Pound/dollar: DOWN at $1.2884 from $1.2889 at 2100 GMT Euro/dollar: UP at $1.0931 from $1.0863 Dollar/yen: DOWN at 113.33 yen from 113.88 yen Oil - Brent North Sea: UP 7 cents at $50.84 per barrel Oil - West Texas Intermediate: UP 1 cent at $47.84 per barrel burs-jmb/acb 12 May 2017 Back to summary Next Newsletter AFP Subscribe to our newsletter AFP's worldwide network The global network of Agence France Presse covers 150 countries Find out more Find out more Contact us If you have news to share or a question, comment or suggestion, contact us via...

Eric Marshall singled out Party City's stock Natalia Wojcik | @nataliawwojcik 9 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES show chapters Find value opportunities in 'unloved' areas of the market: Expert    10 Hours Ago | 02:42 Investors are looking at politics more than anything else, one trader told CNBC on Friday. "We've all been programmed to really watch what's going on in Washington," Jonathan Corpina, senior managing partner at Meridian Equity Partners, said Friday on "Closing Bell." The U.S. stock market closed mostly lower as investors digested a tough week for retailers and mixed economic data. Corpina noted that while earnings and economic data continue to be factors, news from the nation's capital is what investors look for. "[It's] what's occurring and what's giving investors sentiment, confidence or reason to pullback," he added in an interview with "Closing Bell." The S&P 500 notched down 0.15 percent to close at 2,390.90, while the Nasdaq rose 5.27 points, or 0.09 percent, to close at 6,121.23. Eric Marshall, a fund manager with Hodges Capital Management, took a closer look at small-cap stocks. "The small cap stock environment, there is a degree of scarcity out there because you've had a real lack of IPOs and the IPOs that have come out have tended to be much larger," Marshall said. "What we have left today are companies that tend to be more mature as far as where they are in the life cycle — they tend to be more financially secure." Marshall noted that Party City is a consumer discretionary stock that may be a good opportunity. "They are the largest supplier of party supplies to Amazon and Walmart, so they're vertically integrated, and people are spending more and more money on those types of things, so I think even within consumer discretionary, which is a very hated area right now, you can find unique opportunities, you just need to dig hard for them," Marshall said. The Dow Jones industrial average closed down about 23 points, with Goldman Sachs and UnitedHealth contributing the most losses. The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) closed below 10 earlier this week, raising concerns about complacency in the market.

Consider that shares of Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) sold at their IPO in the 1960s for $19, which predated Buffett’s involvement. BRK.A recently changed hands for $245,000, an astounding return of more than 129,000%. That’s a track record that many of the hedge fund tycoons who swear admiration for the Oracle of Omaha couldn’t come close to matching if the flow of funds data is to be believed. The octogenarian billionaire, though, isn’t perfect. Were you to meet him, I would imagine that Buffett would be the first to admit that he is mortal. He has made many mistakes during his storied career. Sometimes, he has failed to understand macroeconomic trends and other times he has been stuck with a management team that failed to deliver the performance that he expected. Warren Buffett also changes his mind. Buffett has made a huge push into airlines in recent years after showing disdain for the sector for decades. Also, Buffett has also gotten over his aversion to technology and now owns 133,000 shares of Apple (AAPL). He also has recently unloaded his most of stake in Wal-Mart Stores (WMT), deciding correctly that traditional retailers are going to be screwed over the long run by Amazon.com (AMZN). In some cases, such as The Coca-Cola Co (KO), Buffett seems to be oblivious to the growing consumer unease about the health issues associated with consuming carbonated beverages. The Cherry Coke-loving investor has been associated with KO for decades and now owns more than 9% of the Atlanta-based company. When Buffett first bought Coca-Cola in 1988, it traded for $2.50 per share adjusted for stock splits. KO now trades for about $43.53. That's obviously a win for Buffett's value investing approach. KO, though, hasn't been much of a plus lately since KO stock has underperformed the broader market for the last 5 years. 10 Dividend Stocks That Will Deliver Double-Digit Returns Every Year Click through the slideshow for examples of investments that didn't go Buffett's way. They are in no particular order. 2/6 SLIDES © Daniel Acker/Bloomberg Berkshire Hathaway No that isn’t a misprint. Long before it was known as Warren Buffett’s conglomerate, BRK.A was a New England textile company. Then a spry 30-something, Buffett butted heads with Seabury Stanton, who was then the company’s CEO. Stanton tried to buy back Buffett’s shares at a price lower than what they had previously agreed. Incensed, Buffett took over Berkshire and subsequently fired Stanton. Soon, though, he realized that Berkshire’s stock was cheap for a good reason, the U.S. textile business was dying. He eventually threw in the towel on Berkshire’s textile business in 1985. In 2010, Warren Buffett described BRK.A as the “dumbest stock I ever bought.” 3/6 SLIDES © Source: Kurt Haubrich via Flickr (Modified) NetJets Although Warren Buffett has admitted that Berkshire's purchase of Dexter Shoes was a mistake, he has been reticent about the acquisition of NetJets, which clearly hasn't worked as well as he would have liked. Buffett was so impressed with fractional jet service after signing up as a customer in 1995 before acquiring it three years later for $725 million. Ever since then, NetJet’s has hit quite a bit of turbulence. Founding CEO Richard Santulli was reportedly forced out in 2009. When Adam Johnson took over the helm of the Columbus, Ohio-based company, he was the fourth CEO since Santulli. In 2015, Buffett claimed that he hadn’t yet gotten a return on his investment. Subsequently, the following years haven’t been kind to NetJets. Berkshire doesn’t report the business profit separately, including in its amorphous "Services" business, which includes his newspaper holdings among other things. The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for the Next Decade What it does say isn’t a huge confidence-builder, attributing a 19% increase in 2016 earnings to a “decline in losses from aircraft impairments and dispositions, partly offset by increases in depreciation and restructuring charges and reduced aircraft sale margins.” 4/6 SLIDES © Source: Shutterstock IBM Warren Buffett has preached for years that investors need to buy stocks in industries that they understand and for decades, he insisted that he avoided the tech sector because he didn’t understand it, even though he admires Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos. That’s what made his decision to make a huge bet on International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) such a head-scratcher. Big Blue, to put it kindly, has loads of issues and has been slow to respond to the growth of cloud computing and other trends. To his credit, Buffett realizes the error of his ways. Earlier this month, he unloaded about one-third of his stake in IBM shares and appears poised to sell even more shares, telling CNBC: “I don’t value IBM the same way that I did six years ago when I started buying. I’ve revalued it somewhat downward.” Neither do many other investors. 5/6 SLIDES © Source: Martijn Koster via Flickr ConocoPhillips Warren Buffett’s decision to more than quadruple his holdings in ConocoPhillips (COP) at the time when oil prices were near their peak shows that even a seasoned pro can make a rookie mistake. To his credit, Buffett fessed up to his blunder, arguing in his 2008 annual shareholder letter that the “terrible timing of my purchase has cost Berkshire several billion dollars.” Interestingly, Warren Buffett also predicted that the odds were “good” that oil prices would sell far higher in the future than their current $40 to $50 level. Fast forward to today and oil prices recently changed hands on the NYMEX at $47.33. The U.S. Energy Information Administration is expecting prices to average $54 in 2017 and $57 in 2018, so it seems that the Oracle of Omaha's prediction was off. 7 Healthcare Stocks With A-Rated Prospects Buffett, though, hasn't soured on the sector entirely and is now the largest shareholder in Philipps 66 (PSX). 6/6 SLIDES © Source: Gordon Joly via Flickr (Modified) Tesco In 2006, Warren Buffett was looking to diversify his holdings outside the U.S. and settled on the U.K. supermarket chain Tesco, where he eventually became the company’s third-largest shareholder. Five years later, he declared TSCDY to be his top pick, explaining to CNBC that “if the price came down some ... I’d buy some more.” It was a decision that he later regretted. Like its counterparts in the U.S., Tesco faced increased competition. An accounting scandal sent shares into a tailspin, forcing BRK.A to take a massive $678 million write-down in 2014. Buffett declared the investment to be a “huge mistake” and has since exited it. Although TSCDY earnings are improving, its latest results lagged analysts' expectations. As of this writing, Johnathan Berr did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities. 6/6 SLIDES AdChoices More from InvestorPlace InvestorPlace View the full site Feedback © 2017 Microsoft Privacy Legal About our Ads Feedback Help MSN Worldwide Newsletter Found the story interesting?

Quotes in the article Kohl's Corp KSS ▼ 36.49 -0.67 -1.80% Nordstrom Inc JWN ▼ 41.20 -5.01 -10.84% Target Corp TGT ▼ 55.80 -0.26 -0.46% bebe stores Inc BEBE ▲ 5.71 +0.60 +11.74% Department store operators Macy's (M), Dillard's (DDS), Kohl's (KSS) and Nordstrom (JWN) each reported first-quarter results on Thursday sparking a selloff in the sector, which continued Friday as Wall Street awaits a slew of more retailers' earnings to come. Retailers have been under pressure as more sales shift online, helping Amazon (AMZN) and online players like Wayfair. As of Friday morning, shares of Macy's were down more than 17 percent for week, while Dillard's stock was down 20 percent, Kohl's was down 11 percent, and Nordstrom's stock has dropped about 15 percent since Monday. J.C. Penney (JCP) reported disappointing, quarterly same-store sales Friday morning, which dragged shares of the stock at one point down to $4.78, a fresh intraday low not seen since 2014. The S&P 500 Retail ETF (XRT) (XRT) was falling near 1.5 percent Friday, trading on pace to mark its second consecutive negative day and its worst week since March. The one winner of the retail sector is Wayfair (W), whose shares are up more than 27 percent for the week and are trading on pace for their best day since 2015. The internet retailer's shares rallied Tuesday after Wayfair reported better-than-expected first-quarter results, boosted by greater furniture sales. Now that many of the department store chains have reported earnings, it's time for big-box retailers Wal-Mart (WMT) and Target (TGT) to take the stage. These two companies, along with names like Home Depot (HD), TJ Maxx (TJX), Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) and Gap (GPS), are scheduled to report earnings next week. Load Error The overarching narrative for much of the retail industry into the first half of 2017 has been store closures and bankruptcies. For example, just recently children's clothing boutique Gymboree (AC) announced plans to close 350 stores, Bebe (BEBE)is shuttering all of its 180 locations, and more store closures are expected from hunting and fishing outlet Gander Mountain following its recent bankruptcy auction. "Retailers have pledged to close over 3,600 stores since the start of the year, which means closures in 2017 have already exceed those in 2016 by a wide margin," Fung Global Retail & Technology analyst Deborah Weinswig said in a statement. "We expect more announcements in the coming months, particularly for stores located in lower-grade malls."  XRT 2-week performance © Provided by CNBC Source: FactSet Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

"The hardest part about all of this was forgiving that driver, and that's even in there and in a funny way," Morgan said in an interview with Vulture.com. "That was the hardest part of all of this, because if I didn't do that we wouldn't be sitting here talking. I couldn't move forward if I ain't forgive him." Driver in Tracy Morgan crash pleads guilty, avoids prison time Morgan was hospitalized with serious injuries after a Wal-Mart truck slammed into his bus on the Cranbury section of the highway in July 2014. A fellow comedian and friend, James McNair, died in the wreck. Truck driver Kevin Roper pleaded guilty to vehicular homicide and other charges in a plea deal to avoid prison time. Roper admitted he continued driving while feeling fatigued. A report by State Police found the trucker was awake for more than 25 hours before the deadly crash.

Consider that shares of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B) sold at their IPO in the 1960s for $19, which predated Buffett’s involvement. BRK.A recently changed hands for $245,000, an astounding return of more than 129,000%. That’s a track record that many of the hedge fund tycoons who swear admiration for the Oracle of Omaha couldn’t come close to matching if the flow of funds data is to be believed. Source: Shutterstock The octogenarian billionaire, though, isn’t perfect. Were you to meet him, I would imagine that Buffett would be the first to admit that he is mortal. He has made many mistakes during his storied career. Sometimes, he has failed to understand macroeconomic trends and other times he has been stuck with a management team that failed to deliver the performance that he expected. Warren Buffett also changes his mind. Buffett has made a huge push into airlines in recent years after showing disdain for the sector for decades. Also, Buffett has also gotten over his aversion to technology and now owns 133,000 shares of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).  He also has recently unloaded his most of stake in Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE:WMT), deciding correctly that traditional retailers are going to be screwed over the long run by Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). In some cases, such as The Coca-Cola Co (NYSE:KO), Buffett seems to be oblivious to the growing consumer unease about the health issues associated with consuming carbonated beverages. The Cherry Coke-loving investor has been associated with KO for decades and now owns more than 9% of the Atlanta-based company. When Buffett first bought Coca-Cola in 1988, it traded for $2.50 per share adjusted for stock splits. KO now trades for about $43.53. That’s obviously a win for Buffett’s value investing approach. KO, though, hasn’t been much of a plus lately since KO stock has underperformed the broader market for the last 5 years. 10 Dividend Stocks That Will Deliver Double-Digit Returns Every Year Below are examples of investments that didn’t go Buffett’s way. They are in no particular order.

Emma and Noah continued their reign as the most popular baby names last year. (AP Photo/Brynn Anderson, File) WASHINGTON (AP) — Don’t call me Caitlyn. A year after Caitlyn Jenner announced her new name and gender, the popularity of the name Caitlyn plummeted more than any other baby name, according to Social Security’s annual list of the most popular baby names. In fact, the four names that dropped the most were all variations of the same name: Caitlin, Caitlyn, Katelynn and Kaitlynn. “It was inevitable,” said Laura Wattenberg, founder of BabynameWizard.com. “Caitlyn was already falling in popularity. Now it is suddenly controversial.” The Social Security Administration released its annual list of the 1,000 most popular baby names for 2016 on Friday. The agency uses the announcement to drive traffic to its website, where workers can start tracking their benefits long before they retire. Emma was the top baby name for girls for the third year in a row. It was followed by Olivia, Ava, Sophia and Isabella. Noah was the top baby name for boys for the fourth year in a row. It was followed by Liam, William, Mason and James. The agency also lists the baby names that increase — and decrease — the most in popularity. All four versions of Caitlyn fell out of the top 1,000. In 2015, the former Bruce Jenner, an Olympic gold medalist, shocked the world when she announced that she is now a transgender woman. The iconic cover of Vanity Fair magazine was emblazoned with the quote, “Call me Caitlyn,” on top of a picture of a very feminine Jenner. The issue sparked much debate and an outpouring of support for Jenner in a country that is still evolving in its views of gay marriage and equal rights for the LGBT community. The first time any spelling of Caitlin showed up on Social Security’s list of popular baby names was in 1976 when Caitlin debuted at No. 947. C-a-i-t-l-i-n has been the most common spelling. The name reached the height of its popularity in 1988, when it ranked No. 44. After 17 years in the top 100 it started to fall after the turn of the century. Last year, it fell 542 spots — the biggest drop of any name — to No. 1,151. Wattenberg said it would be wrong to blame Caitlyn’s drop in popularity solely to the fact that Jenner is transgender. In general, she said, parents don’t want to give their children names that might attract controversy. It’s one reason few parents name their children after politicians.

Hillary fell out of the top 1,000 names in 2009 and has not returned. The Social Security Administration’s website provides lists of the top 1,000 baby names for each year, dating to 1880. The top baby names that year were John and Mary. John is now No. 28 and Mary has fallen to No. 127. Sometimes old is new: Emma was the third most popular name in 1880. The top 10 baby names for girls stayed the same in 2016, though the order shuffled a bit. For boys, Alexander dropped to No. 11 and Elijah cracked the top 10 for the first time ever, at No. 9. Baby naming experts said parents have long used biblical names for their children. However, there has been a decided shift from the New Testament to the Old. “Elijah to our grandparents would be unimaginable,” Wattenberg said. Also, parents are getting more creative in naming the little ones. As a result, today’s top names aren’t nearly as popular as the top names from 50 years ago. For example, a little more than 19,000 baby boys were named Noah last year. In 1966, about 80,000 babies were named Michael, the top name for baby boys that year. “Once parents see that a name is super popular, they are going to start avoiding it,” said Jennifer Moss, founder of Babynames.com. Pop culture often influences the names that increase and decrease in popularity, and it happened again 2016. For boys, the named that skyrocketed in popularity was Kylo, as in Kylo Ren, a character in the 2015 movie, “Star Wars: The Force Awakens.” For girls, it was Kehlani, as in Kehlani Parrish, a singer and songwriter nominated for a Grammy in 2016. Neither of these names is among the most popular, but they jumped more spots than any other names. Kylo jumped 2,368 spots to No. 901. Kehlani jumped 2,487 spots to No. 872.

Cohen May 12, 2017 The pro-charter candidates in Tuesday’s Los Angeles election are backed by the Walton family, Michael Bloomberg, and Eli Broad.

And yet, this race that barely anyone will vote in has turned into a high-stakes battleground, complete with record-setting amounts of political spending and bitter negative campaigning. It has pitted some of the richest men in American against none other than Bernie Sanders, in a brawl over the future of public education in the nation’s largest state. Incumbent board president Steve Zimmer, backed by labor, is running against the education reformer Nicholas Melvoin; in another district, labor-backed Imelda Padilla is facing off against the charter-backed Kelly Fitzpatrick-Gonez in an open race. Los Angeles is last of the big-city school districts to hold elections for local school board members—mayors in cities like Chicago and New York appoint their school boards, and Washington, D.C., dissolved its local school board altogether in 2007, giving education decision-making power to the mayoral-appointed schools chancellor. Despite the current showdown, Los Angeles is hardly anti-reform. With 279 charter schools, Los Angeles has more charters than any other city in the nation. According to the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools (NAPCS), roughly 156,000 LA public school students—24 percent of total enrollment—attended charter schools during the 2015-16 school year. The second highest city on NAPCS’s list was New York, which enrolled 93,610 students in charters that year. But the ambitions of national reformers still far exceed the district’s appetite for change, at least thus far. Although the LA school board has approved most petitions for new charters and charter renewals, charter advocates say they feel the board’s support for opening new ones is waning. And in September of 2015 The Los Angeles Times published a confidential document from billionaire Eli Broad’s foundation, revealing plans to increase Los Angeles’s charter school market share to 50 percent over the next eight years. This transformation would require the creation of 260 new charters, at a cost of $490 million. The bombshell report sparked intense controversy. By March of 2016, education reformers had toned down their public rhetoric and goals, emphasizing that they’d support expanding all types of high-quality schools, not just charters. The modified plan did little to tamp down tensions between charter supporters and opponents. A union-funded study released in May of 2016 reported that the city’s charter sector drains upwards of $500 million a year from the school district’s budget. The teachers union and its allies charged that unmitigated charter school growth “imperils the financial stability” of the district, and limits opportunities for those students who remain in traditional public schools. Last month, in a 4-3 vote, the Los Angeles Board of Education voted to endorse three controversial bills in the state legislature that would place more oversight and restrictions on charter schools. The California Charter Schools Association strongly opposed the bills, and both Melvoin and Fitzpatrick-Gonez said they would oppose the measures if elected. (Zimmer voted in favor of endorsing the bills, and Padilla declined to take a position.) Money from outside the city and state has been pouring into the two races. The previous record in outside donations for school board elections had been $7.4 million in 2013. As of April 29, outside spending had already reached $11.3 million, according to the city’s ethics commission campaign finance data. As LA Weekly put it, “To say the 2017 Los Angeles election for school board is the most expensive such race in the history of the United States is an understatement: It is the most expensive by more than 50 percent.” (And this is all for a job that pays $45,000 a year.) Nationally, charter advocates often justify their reliance on the deep pockets of billionaire supporters as necessary to compete with the spending of local teachers unions. But other sources place reform spending at least in parity with union spending. As EdSource, a nonprofit education news site focused on California recently reported, “In past years, the teachers union far outspent the [charter] association on campaign contributions. Not anymore.” In the Los Angeles school board race, the charter advocates have outspent the unions by roughly a third, with significant money coming from billionaire-donors like Eli Broad, Michael Bloomberg, Walmart heirs Alice and Jim Walton, Gap co-founder Doris Fisher, and Netflix CEO Reed Hastings. And LA Weekly reports that $4.1 million has been spent on negative campaigning in the runoffs, compared to $1.1 million in the 2015 race, and under $1 million in 2013. Fifty-eight percent of the negative campaign financing has been directed by charter proponents against Zimmer. The unprecedented escalation of the races has also attracted some high-profile, highly unusual endorsements from political leaders and celebrities. “Billionaires should not make a profit off of public school children,” said Democratic senator Bernie Sanders in a statement earlier this month. “That’s why I’m supporting Steve Zimmer and Imelda Padilla for the Los Angeles School Board. They will fight against the Trump/DeVos agenda to destabilize and undermine public schools.” Sanders’ endorsement—which links the education reform agenda of Melvoin and Fitzpatrick-Gonez to President Trump’s controversial education agenda—reflects a larger national strategy being pursued by advocates of traditional public education since Donald Trump was elected. It attempts to link charter advocates to a man Democrats despise. It also frames Tuesday’s choice as something larger than charter schools or traditional schools: an extension of a national debate about whether the public sector, including education, will be democratic and equitable, or privatized and outsourced to the lowest bidder. Is it working? Time will tell, but Melvoin seems to be feeling the heat: in an article in LA School Report from March, he discussed pressure to dispel myths that he was a “Trump guy.” Melvoin and Fitzpatrick-Gonez can claim support, however, from prominent Democratic charter backers. Both have received endorsements from Arne Duncan, the former education secretary under Barack Obama, while Fitzpatrick-Gonez formerly worked as an Obama administration education adviser.  PinItInstapaperPocketEmailPrint You may also like Mass Incarceration and the Achievement Gap Leila Morsy The impact of imprisoned parents on children shows how criminal justice policy is education policy New Jersey Teacher Tenure Lawsuit Dismissed Rachel M.

(David Paul Morris/Bloomberg News) We’ve long known that e-commerce is creating turmoil in retail, as it gives rise to new start-ups and business models while taking a sledgehammer to old-school brick-and-mortar selling. But it feels lately as if the signs of trouble are piling up at a particularly fast clip. Here’s a look at some of the hints of upheaval we saw this week. Department store disaster. As several major department stores reported quarterly financial results, it was a steady stream of gloom. Kohl’s saw a 2.7 percent decline in comparable sales, a measure of sales at stores open more than a year. Nordstrom saw its store traffic slip, and Macy’s stock got hammered on Thursday after it delivered a startling 5.2 percent drop in comparable sales. Investors punished J.C. Penney, too, for a weak quarter. These companies have a tangle of problems, including waning foot traffic to shopping malls and a customer that is often choosing to spend on experiences instead of goods. Those are big-picture cultural shifts that the long-standing retailers have little ability to control. Where they have more power is in their efforts to fend off the mounting pressure from the likes of fast-fashion players such as H&M and off-price stores such as Marshalls. And there’s little evidence that department stores are doing that well. Nordstrom said there was weakness in the portion of its shoe assortment aimed at younger, more value-oriented customers — exactly the kind of shopper that is probably peeling off for rivals that offer low prices. J.C. Penney said its crucial women’s apparel category was “challenged” this quarter; while Macy’s saw weakness in handbag and costume jewelry sales. There are glimmers of hope if you look hard: Nordstrom, for example, now draws almost a quarter of its total sales online, and sales in that channel are growing robustly. It suggests there is a path forward for the retailer in a digital world. Abercrombie & Fitch is looking for a buyer. It has been years since it first became clear that Abercrombie’s screaming logos and sexed-up imagery were no longer attracting teens’ attention. It has dumped its longtime chief executive and closed stores in pursuit of an as-yet elusive turnaround. This week, as its challenges continue, the apparel chain acknowledged it is exploring a sale. Suitors reportedly include American Eagle Outfitters and Express. If Abercrombie goes under the wing of one of its key rivals, it would emphasize just how dramatically the retail landscape has been reshaped recent months. Walmart has been scooping up e-commerce players such as Moosejaw and Modcloth. Familiar names such as The Limited and American Apparel have closed all of their stores; Payless Shoe Source filed for bankruptcy and pulled out of hundreds of malls. And buckle up, because the retail roller coaster could have more twists ahead: The parent company of Saks Fifth Avenue reportedly is exploring acquiring Macy’s or Neiman Marcus. Grocery behemoth Albertsons may be considering a bid for troubled Whole Foods Market. Rue21 appears to be weighing whether to file for bankruptcy. Gillette makes another run at your mailbox. On Tuesday, the Procter & Gamble-owned shaving behemoth announced a new service it is calling Gillette On Demand, its latest effort to beat back intense competition from upstarts Harry’s and Dollar Shave Club, the e-commerce outposts that sell razors on subscription models. Gillette had previously answered the challenge by launching a subscription service of its own, but now it is trying a different tactic. In addition to subscriptions, it is to offer one-off purchasing. And once customers have used the service initially, they can reorder by texting the word “BLADES” to a certain phone number. The service itself is not exactly a game-changing disruption, but its arrival underscores how urgent the fight is for Gillette. A key P&G rival, Unilever, bought Dollar Shave Club last year and can put serious muscle behind expanding the young brand. The showdown between 110-year-old Gillette and the razor start-ups is symbolic of a broader shift in the industry. Niche players are increasingly pulling dollars away from big retailing monoliths to the tune of $200 billion a year, according to research by Deloitte. Everyone from Macy’s to Campbell Soup is facing similar pressure from boutique-like insurgents, to which customers are flocking for a unique, exclusive vibe. Meanwhile, Gillette’s maneuvers serve as an interesting case study for the wider consumer goods industry. Many brands are currently dabbling in what’s known as a “direct-to-consumer” model, in which they sell through their own branded stores and websites, rather than through general merchandise or department stores. In the digital era, it gives them more control of how their product is distributed, displayed and priced, but it also requires them to add a new competency to their business. If Gillette can do well with a direct-to-consumer model, it might not be long before other familiar drugstore and grocery store brands begin going in the same direction. business business true Please provide a valid email address.

(AP) — A Tucson woman is accused of substituting flour for infant formula in containers returned to several local stores for refunds, and police have warned the public to check formula containers’ seals for tampering. One child got sick from ingesting tampered formula but is in good condition after being treated at a hospital and released May 5, police said late Thursday. Police Chief Chris Magnus held an unusual nighttime news conference to disclose the arrest and to warn the public. “We’re concerned about this and wanted to get the information out as quickly as possible to avoid any other children from becoming sick,” Magnus said. Police said the suspect was motivated by money and apparently took place over at least several days and possibly for up to two months. The formula was either purchased or stolen, police said. Sign up for the online chat with Col. Brandon Pearce, NGA's chief information security officer, May 15, 12:30 p.m. Advertisement Dr. Francisco Garcia, chief medical officer for Pima County, said tests are being conducted to determine whether other substances were put in formula containers along with flour, such as something to make it more palatable. Police said Jennifer LaPlante, 30, was arrested Thursday on suspicion of fraudulent schemes and artifices and child endangerment. LaPlante remained jailed Friday. It wasn’t immediately known whether she has an attorney who could comment on the allegations. Police listed two Fry’s grocery stores and two Wal-Mart stores, all on Tucson’s eastside, that are linked to the incident. Officials at Arkansas-based Wal-Mart said they don’t restock baby formula and are “deeply disturbed” by the Tucson incident. “Our customers deserve safe, quality foods, and we have policies in place to help ensure that returned baby formula is not put back on our shelves,” Wal-Mart spokesman Ragan Dickens said in a statement. Commentary: The nobility of public service is making a comeback A police department spokesman, Sgt. Pete Dugan, said Friday he wasn’t aware of additional reports of tampered formula. However, detectives remained “smack-dab in the middle of the investigation,” Dugan said. “They need to find out if there’s others involved. They need to find out if there’s other stores involved.” Officials advised recent purchasers of infant formula from Tucson businesses to check seals on containers and to see whether the formula smelled normal. Parents shouldn’t feed infants with any formula if there’s any question of possible tampering, Garcia said. “Those seals should be intact,” he said.

The founder and executive chairman of the Montreal-based fashion powerhouse Aldo Group announced today that he is donating $25 million to his alma mater, McGill University in Montreal, for the formation of an interdisciplinary school focused on the retail industry. Related Camila Cabello Performs in These Surprisingly Affordable Heels The Bensadoun School of Retail Management is expected to open in 2018 and will offer comprehensive academic programming, from the undergraduate to the Ph.D. level. It will also focus heavily on experiential learning, through partnerships with local and global retailers and a teaching-and-research lab that will be located on the corner of Sherbrooke and McTavish streets in Montreal. University faculty lauded the gift, noting that the retail school will make use of McGill’s existing research into topics such as neuroscience and human behavior, to develop a next-level analysis for retail predictions. “By leveraging the breadth and depth of research performed across the university, and in close partnership with the industry, the proposed school will reinvent the future of retail management,” said Isabelle Bajeux-Besnainou, dean and professor of finance at McGill’s Desautels Faculty of Management. Here, Mr. B. himself talks with FN about his plan to foster new ideas in retail. On a personal level, why did you want to make this gift to McGill? “I went to school at Cornell University and then at McGill, and I very much enjoyed my time at McGill. And while I was there, like any university in the States, you had a lot of people that would make donations that would help strengthen the institution and its studies, in order to make the next generation stronger than your own. So I thought that if one day I had the means to do it, it would be beautiful for me, and it would be a bit of a dream, to [give back to the school]. So we now have the privilege of doing it.” The founder flanked by longtime members of his design team. Richmond Lam How will this school impact the next generation? “As you are very aware, retail is in a major transformation phase, and I felt the need to have the right institution, on a worldwide basis, help retailers face the new challenges in the industry. Walmart used to be the champion in retail, but now it’s more about Amazon and Uber and everything that’s on the web. Also, to be successful you need to be very consumer-centric and understand the behavior of the consumer. I felt that with McGill being a very strong institution, we could create an international school where a lot of the best students in the world and the strongest retailers in the world, as well as the strongest teachers in the world, could come together. And the idea would be to not only [focus on] accounting and finance, but also art, psychology, anthropology, architecture and big-data analytics. So all those disciplines that are already taught but in different schools, if we could put them together and form a strong school of retail, it would give us a chance to come up with a solution. And maybe the next Elon Musk will graduate from McGill in 10 years’ time, who knows?” Will you be involved in developing the program? “No, McGill will develop the curriculum. But retailers — not only me, but hopefully many retailers from different parts of the world — will be involved in the teaching and the research, and basically in coming up with the best way of finding solutions to understanding the behavior of customers.” The new Aldo store at Westfield World Trade Center in New York.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 12 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Kiosk Market Trends and Forecast By 2024 The North America kiosk market has been witnessing significant advancements over the past few years. Pop-up kiosks and the incorporation of digital signage offer high scope for growth over the forecast period. Emerging as an important marketing tool for businesses to reach their target audience, kiosks enable the assessment of new products as well as new geographic locations. Online retailers have been given a chance to experiment in traditional retail settings without investing in any physical presence. The revenue of the kiosk market in North America stood at US$2.5 bn in 2015 and is expected to reach US$4.4 bn by 2024 at a 6.2% CAGR therein. On the basis of volume, the market is projected to expand at a CAGR of 6.6% from 2016 to 2024. Obtain Report Details: www.transparencymarketresearch.com/north-america-kiosk-ma… Retail and healthcare are the most prominent applications of kiosks in North America, with the highest return on investment (ROI). Apart from these, kiosks also find application in other end-use sectors such as government, banking, financial services, and insurance (BFSI), travel and tourism, advertisement, and entertainment. In the retail sector, kiosks are used for gift registry, inventory extension, loyalty, bill payment, and automated retail vending. Technological advancements in the retail sector are likely to fuel the use of kiosks in this application segment, enabling it to emerge as the dominant one by 2024. The adoption rate of healthcare-based kiosks is relatively slower, but is likely to pick up pace over the coming years. In the healthcare sector, kiosks are used for applications such as patient check-in and check-out, wayfinding and directory, human resource, hospital information, patient and physician communication portals, and virtual receptionist. The North America kiosk market is bifurcated into the U.S. and rest of North America by geography. In 2015, the U.S. emerged as the dominant segment by revenue as well as volume and the country is estimated to continue its lead through 2024. The U.S. kiosk market was valued at US$2.3 bn in 2015 and is projected to expand at a CAGR of 6.4% during the forecast period to cross US$4 bn by 2024. Both the retail and healthcare application segments in the U.S. contributed to the dominance of this region in the North America kiosk market. The U.S. kiosk market is projected to expand at a pace much greater than that of the rest of North America, TMR predicts. Make an Enquiry: www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag… One of the major factors responsible for the dominance of the U.S. in the North America kiosk market is the established presence of leading players and their continuous promotional efforts across the country. A case in point would be CVS Caremark Corp. The U.S.-based retailer and healthcare company has thousands of drug and pharmacy stores across the country with integrated kiosk bases. Food Lion, the U.S. division of Brussels-based Delhaize Group, has retail kiosks set up all over the U.S. in collaboration with American computer hardware, software and electronics company NCR Corporation. Retail giants such as The Kroger Company, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., ALDI US, and Albertsons Companies Inc. have been progressing with their self-checkout rollouts. All of these activities continue to drive the kiosk market in the U.S. About TMR Transparency Market Research (TMR) is a global market intelligence company providing business information reports and services.

The surest sign Amazon is on the verge of dominating its next retail category emerges when online sales start to account for more than 20% of that business, according to an analysis by L2. Must read: Amazon investors should pay attention to this two-digit number Here is how Amazon managed to pass that mark in three key areas over the course of its history. Books Way back before companies were feverishly devising ways to thwart Amazon, they were ignoring the e-commerce site all together. The book publishing and book selling world had no idea what was coming when Amazon AMZN, +1.45% first set its sights on that sector, and did little to prepare for the onslaught. In August 2005, Barnes & Noble Inc. BKS, -2.45% was enjoying bumps in traffic and sales from “Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.” So was Amazon. It was the online company’s biggest new product release, the company said at the time. Don’t miss: Meet Amazon.com’s first-ever customer — there’s a building named after him at headquarters Book publishers were grappling with how to maintain online control over the titles they were publishing. In November 2005, Amazon was hatching a plan to launch Amazon Upgrade, allowing online access to physical books customers had bought on the site. And there were questions about whether Google GOOG, +0.17% GOOGL, -0.08% had the right to scan books to make them searchable and provide excerpts, and whether publishers would go along with a book-rental plan. At the same time, lower-priced used books were becoming more popular on Amazon and other sites, cutting publishers out of the revenue stream. Somewhere between 2007 and 2008, the books category hit that 20% e-commerce mark, according to U.S. Department of Commerce data provided to MarketWatch by L2’s Cooper Smith, director of Amazon intelligence for the research firm. That 20% threshold is a critical figure, signifying a change in consumer behavior toward online shopping that works in Amazon’s favor. Amazon launched the Kindle in late 2007 and not only changed the way many people read books but how they bought them: directly from a device with the content delivered wirelessly. The Kindle also transformed the industry’s pricing model, bringing the cost of e-books down to $9.99 as print books were priced as high as $25 or more. Barnes & Noble didn’t launch its first Nook until October 2009, giving Amazon a two-year advantage. “[W]e believe that this is the first inning and that it will be a multibillion-dollar opportunity for Barnes & Noble,” said then–Chief Executive Stephen Riggio at the time. It was a huge money-making opportunity — for Amazon, not Barnes & Noble. Fast-forward, and Amazon’s share of e-commerce for books in 2016 was a stunning 93%, according to data provided by Slice Intelligence. E-book sales rose 3.7% annually between 2011 and 2016, reaching $3.9 billion in 2016, according to Codex Group data provided by IBISWorld. Annual growth between 2016 and 2021 is expected to be 1.3%. In the most recent quarter, total sales for Barnes & Noble fell 8% on a year-over-year basis to $1.3 billion, and Nook sales fell 25.7% to $38.4 million. But at least Barnes & Noble still exists, unlike Borders, B. Dalton and many other booksellers both large and small. “Books make sense. There’s no real touch and feel, whereas on the other end of the spectrum, bananas have high touch and feel,” said Matt Sargent, senior vice president of retail at consulting firm Frank N. Magid Associates, explaining why Amazon would dive into the book business. “Amazon is picky about categories; [It] took the lowest-hanging fruit first, and moved upward.” See also: Thanks, Amazon! Now indie bookstores are booming Plus: The depressingly huge impact the end of adult-color-book fad and Adele had on Barnes & Noble revenue Into electronics Books have barely changed over the centuries. Consumer electronics, however, can be obsolete in a matter of a few years. On the one hand, that makes the consumer-electronics category complicated, especially for not-so-savvy customers. And there are certain things, like the finish of an appliance, that a shopper might want to see in a store before making a purchase. On the other hand, said Eric Voyer, vice president of market research firm TraQline, “there are some categories in consumer electronics [where] they know exactly what they’re going to get.” In those cases, a couple of clicks to purchase may be all a customer needs.

Amazon is closing in, he said, on items like TVs and computer accessories. In the “online only” electronics category, Amazon had 32.5% of dollar share in 2016, while Best Buy BBY, -1.65% had 12.5% share. Wal-Mart WMT, -0.55% had 6.2%, according to TraQline. Read: WPP buys consulting firm specializing in Amazon Also: Want more portfolio diversification? Try different weights, not different assets A December blog post by Nicholas Johnson, head of platform for the marketplace advisory company Applico, which aims to help clients compete with Amazon and Google GOOG, +0.17% GOOGL, -0.08%  , charts the decline of Circuit City, which went bankrupt in 2008. Amazon, which racked up its first book sales in 1995, launched consumer-electronics sales in 1999 and the Amazon Marketplace in 2000. In 2001, that marketplace stocked inventory from Circuit City and by 2004 was selling more than $1 billion in electronics. Amazon, according to Johnson, sold “enough of the smaller items that consumers typically bought at Circuit City — MP3 players, computer accessories, headphones, computer parts and the like — [that it] eroded Circuit City’s margins so much that many of its locations would become unprofitable.” Circuit City filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in November 2008. By March 2009, a group of four liquidators had sold off $1.7 billion of inventory in going-out-of-business sales and the 60-year-old company closed its doors for good. Now Amazon has moved into a wider variety of items, many of them Amazon-branded. In the fourth quarter, according to Amazon, it sold “millions” of Fire tablets and Fire TV devices, and Alexa-enabled devices “were the top-selling products across all categories on Amazon.com” during the holidays, with Amazon Echo sales up more than nine times on a year-over-year basis. In his most recent shareholder letter, Amazon Chief Executive Jeff Bezos said it’s been a “struggle to keep Echo in stock.” Echo devices aren’t just for gathering information and listening to music. They’re increasingly being used to purchase products, with Prime Now ordering added in recent weeks, much the way Kindle is used to purchase books. The latest Echo Look device builds on the company’s fashion business, offering style advice, purchase recommendations and another path into the category. And barely two weeks after introducing the Echo Look, Amazon unveiled the Echo Show, demonstrating just how fast it can bring out a major product add-on in the already-fast-moving world of consumer electronics. Ahead in the cloud Amazon’s adventures in the cloud have arguably been its most successful to date. The company was quickly out in front of the cloud-services business with Amazon Web Services, or AWS, which has turned into a consistently positive section of the company’s earnings report. Amazon has more market share than top tech companies like Microsoft and Google. AWS rolled out quietly in 2006, roughly six years ahead of its closest competition. That gave Amazon a head start in shaping the public cloud industry and allowed it to invest in the infrastructure that is now underpinning much of the internet. “AWS was essentially the first to launch,” said John Dinsdale, chief analyst at Synergy Research Group. It “made the market its own” before other big players launched similar services. By the time others did appear on the scene, they were playing catch-up “from a long way behind,” he said. See: The college that supplies the most graduates to Silicon Valley While Microsoft MSFT, -0.12% Google, and IBM IBM, -0.19% have all since introduced rival services, Amazon’s AWS maintains its dominant position in public cloud services, with a more than 40% share, according to Synergy data. The other three have grown an aggregate five percentage points over the past year and account for 23% of the market, but they’re growing at the expense of smaller providers, not Amazon. “That is unlikely to change any time soon,” Dinsdale said. Amazon has been able to maintain such a large lead because of the aggressive investments it has made in expanding its network and price cuts that have kept its service competitive. AWS has cut prices more than 50 times since its launch in 2006, and SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst Kunal Madhukar said he wouldn’t be surprised if further price reductions were coming in the near future, following recent cost cuts for Microsoft’s Azure. Amazon also continues to add new infrastructure to support AWS around the world. It recently announced plans to open an infrastructure region in Sweden in 2018, joining the 16 regional operations it currently maintains around the world, with another two slated to come online later this year. In February, Amazon reported fiscal 2016 AWS revenue of $12.2 billion, a 54% year-over-year increase. Operating income more than doubled to $3.1 billion from $1.5 billion in 2016. But AWS revenue has decelerated in recent quarters, and Amazon has had to cut prices to remain competitive. AWS’s year-over-year revenue growth was 43% in the first quarter of 2017, compared with 47% in the fourth quarter of 2016, 55% in the third quarter and 58% in the quarter before that.

The company was quickly out in front of the cloud-services business with Amazon Web Services, or AWS, which has turned into a consistently positive section of the company’s earnings report. Amazon has more market share than top tech companies like Microsoft and Google. AWS rolled out quietly in 2006, roughly six years ahead of its closest competition. That gave Amazon a head start in shaping the public cloud industry and allowed it to invest in the infrastructure that is now underpinning much of the internet. “AWS was essentially the first to launch,” said John Dinsdale, chief analyst at Synergy Research Group. It “made the market its own” before other big players launched similar services. By the time others did appear on the scene, they were playing catch-up “from a long way behind,” he said. See: The college that supplies the most graduates to Silicon Valley While Microsoft MSFT, -0.12% Google, and IBM IBM, -0.19% have all since introduced rival services, Amazon’s AWS maintains its dominant position in public cloud services, with a more than 40% share, according to Synergy data. The other three have grown an aggregate five percentage points over the past year and account for 23% of the market, but they’re growing at the expense of smaller providers, not Amazon. “That is unlikely to change any time soon,” Dinsdale said. Amazon has been able to maintain such a large lead because of the aggressive investments it has made in expanding its network and price cuts that have kept its service competitive. AWS has cut prices more than 50 times since its launch in 2006, and SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst Kunal Madhukar said he wouldn’t be surprised if further price reductions were coming in the near future, following recent cost cuts for Microsoft’s Azure. Amazon also continues to add new infrastructure to support AWS around the world. It recently announced plans to open an infrastructure region in Sweden in 2018, joining the 16 regional operations it currently maintains around the world, with another two slated to come online later this year. In February, Amazon reported fiscal 2016 AWS revenue of $12.2 billion, a 54% year-over-year increase. Operating income more than doubled to $3.1 billion from $1.5 billion in 2016. But AWS revenue has decelerated in recent quarters, and Amazon has had to cut prices to remain competitive. AWS’s year-over-year revenue growth was 43% in the first quarter of 2017, compared with 47% in the fourth quarter of 2016, 55% in the third quarter and 58% in the quarter before that.

The surest sign Amazon is on the verge of dominating its next retail category emerges when online sales start to account for more than 20% of that business, according to an analysis by L2. Must read: Amazon investors should pay attention to this two-digit number Here is how Amazon managed to pass that mark in three key areas over the course of its history. Books Way back before companies were feverishly devising ways to thwart Amazon, they were ignoring the e-commerce site all together. The book publishing and book selling world had no idea what was coming when Amazon AMZN, +1.45% first set its sights on that sector, and did little to prepare for the onslaught. In August 2005, Barnes & Noble Inc. BKS, -2.45% was enjoying bumps in traffic and sales from “Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.” So was Amazon. It was the online company’s biggest new product release, the company said at the time. Don’t miss: Meet Amazon.com’s first-ever customer — there’s a building named after him at headquarters Book publishers were grappling with how to maintain online control over the titles they were publishing. In November 2005, Amazon was hatching a plan to launch Amazon Upgrade, allowing online access to physical books customers had bought on the site. And there were questions about whether Google GOOG, +0.17% GOOGL, -0.08% had the right to scan books to make them searchable and provide excerpts, and whether publishers would go along with a book-rental plan. At the same time, lower-priced used books were becoming more popular on Amazon and other sites, cutting publishers out of the revenue stream. Somewhere between 2007 and 2008, the books category hit that 20% e-commerce mark, according to U.S. Department of Commerce data provided to MarketWatch by L2’s Cooper Smith, director of Amazon intelligence for the research firm. That 20% threshold is a critical figure, signifying a change in consumer behavior toward online shopping that works in Amazon’s favor. Amazon launched the Kindle in late 2007 and not only changed the way many people read books but how they bought them: directly from a device with the content delivered wirelessly. The Kindle also transformed the industry’s pricing model, bringing the cost of e-books down to $9.99 as print books were priced as high as $25 or more. Barnes & Noble didn’t launch its first Nook until October 2009, giving Amazon a two-year advantage. “[W]e believe that this is the first inning and that it will be a multibillion-dollar opportunity for Barnes & Noble,” said then–Chief Executive Stephen Riggio at the time. It was a huge money-making opportunity — for Amazon, not Barnes & Noble. Fast-forward, and Amazon’s share of e-commerce for books in 2016 was a stunning 93%, according to data provided by Slice Intelligence. E-book sales rose 3.7% annually between 2011 and 2016, reaching $3.9 billion in 2016, according to Codex Group data provided by IBISWorld. Annual growth between 2016 and 2021 is expected to be 1.3%. In the most recent quarter, total sales for Barnes & Noble fell 8% on a year-over-year basis to $1.3 billion, and Nook sales fell 25.7% to $38.4 million. But at least Barnes & Noble still exists, unlike Borders, B. Dalton and many other booksellers both large and small. “Books make sense. There’s no real touch and feel, whereas on the other end of the spectrum, bananas have high touch and feel,” said Matt Sargent, senior vice president of retail at consulting firm Frank N. Magid Associates, explaining why Amazon would dive into the book business. “Amazon is picky about categories; [It] took the lowest-hanging fruit first, and moved upward.” See also: Thanks, Amazon! Now indie bookstores are booming Plus: The depressingly huge impact the end of adult-color-book fad and Adele had on Barnes & Noble revenue Into electronics Books have barely changed over the centuries. Consumer electronics, however, can be obsolete in a matter of a few years. On the one hand, that makes the consumer-electronics category complicated, especially for not-so-savvy customers. And there are certain things, like the finish of an appliance, that a shopper might want to see in a store before making a purchase. On the other hand, said Eric Voyer, vice president of market research firm TraQline, “there are some categories in consumer electronics [where] they know exactly what they’re going to get.” In those cases, a couple of clicks to purchase may be all a customer needs.

Amazon is closing in, he said, on items like TVs and computer accessories. In the “online only” electronics category, Amazon had 32.5% of dollar share in 2016, while Best Buy BBY, -1.65% had 12.5% share. Wal-Mart WMT, -0.55% had 6.2%, according to TraQline. Read: WPP buys consulting firm specializing in Amazon Also: Want more portfolio diversification? Try different weights, not different assets A December blog post by Nicholas Johnson, head of platform for the marketplace advisory company Applico, which aims to help clients compete with Amazon and Google GOOG, +0.17% GOOGL, -0.08%  , charts the decline of Circuit City, which went bankrupt in 2008. Amazon, which racked up its first book sales in 1995, launched consumer-electronics sales in 1999 and the Amazon Marketplace in 2000. In 2001, that marketplace stocked inventory from Circuit City and by 2004 was selling more than $1 billion in electronics. Amazon, according to Johnson, sold “enough of the smaller items that consumers typically bought at Circuit City — MP3 players, computer accessories, headphones, computer parts and the like — [that it] eroded Circuit City’s margins so much that many of its locations would become unprofitable.” Circuit City filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in November 2008. By March 2009, a group of four liquidators had sold off $1.7 billion of inventory in going-out-of-business sales and the 60-year-old company closed its doors for good. Now Amazon has moved into a wider variety of items, many of them Amazon-branded. In the fourth quarter, according to Amazon, it sold “millions” of Fire tablets and Fire TV devices, and Alexa-enabled devices “were the top-selling products across all categories on Amazon.com” during the holidays, with Amazon Echo sales up more than nine times on a year-over-year basis. In his most recent shareholder letter, Amazon Chief Executive Jeff Bezos said it’s been a “struggle to keep Echo in stock.” Echo devices aren’t just for gathering information and listening to music. They’re increasingly being used to purchase products, with Prime Now ordering added in recent weeks, much the way Kindle is used to purchase books. The latest Echo Look device builds on the company’s fashion business, offering style advice, purchase recommendations and another path into the category. And barely two weeks after introducing the Echo Look, Amazon unveiled the Echo Show, demonstrating just how fast it can bring out a major product add-on in the already-fast-moving world of consumer electronics. Ahead in the cloud Amazon’s adventures in the cloud have arguably been its most successful to date.

It is a metaphor for what Mr. Friedman hopes to convey in this book, which features reporting from several mid-western American states in the run up to the 2016 elections. The idea, he says, is to demystify the idea of the American Dream, to show that it doesn’t exist now and that, it was only partially true in the first place. At an event in the National Centre for the Performing Arts in Mumbai on Thursday, Mr. Friedman was in conversation with Manjeet Kripalani, co-founder of the Mumbai-based think tank Gateway House, on the reasons for writing his book and his experience of revisiting America. Rediscovering home For several years prior to 2016, Mr. Friedman had lived outside America, working most prominently in Italy, and he had just completed a book and documentary about the controversial former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi in 2015. “My publishers told me that I should now be working on a book about the death of Europe or about Asia,” he said, “but I said that there was something else that needed to be done first. I was an investigative journalist but I had never investigated my own country, America.” It had been close to 30 years since he had lived in America, but he was eager to go back and report on what he thought the elite media was not reporting: the death of the ‘real’ America. “This is not Fifth Avenue in New York, not Hollywood, but travelling through highways in places like Mississippi, Colorado and South Carolina, and looking from the ground up at what people were thinking.” The Trump appeal What he found was a country deeply divided and wounded, and the conversations that he delved into were about income inequality, extreme poverty and an atmosphere of racism that has never disappeared. It’s important to note that his reporting was done in the spring of 2016, ahead of the American presidential elections, because many of these issues became more apparent and received more focus in the American media after the Donald Trump’s shock win. Mr. Friedman said he wanted to investigate the real stories behind the border wall that Mr Trump was proposing, behind gun violence, and the debates around access to healthcare and education perhaps best exemplified by the deeply divisive issue of the so-called Obamacare plan. “I wanted to ask, how did we get to this place? And I found through my reporting that the America I was encountering was not the America of the American dream but a pretty different place.” His deciding to report ahead of the 2016 election was also to help him understand the rhetoric of candidate Trump, and why it seemed to be working. “There were so many people just looking for hope.’ And there were politicians who were able to catalyse that feeling and that fear. Marginalised Americans Much of the book deals with issues now being discussed in the US, about how sections of the media wilfully ignored the suffering of Americans living in extreme poverty, who felt disenfranchised and simply wanted to be heard. His account should also provide an insightful background to the current debates going on in US politics, particularly about issues like healthcare. The numbers that Mr Friedman presents in his book represent a hidden America, an America that an international audience has very little idea about. At least 14.5% Americans live below the poverty line and 23% are what can be classified as the working poor. “All in all, about 102 million Americans, about one-third of the population, are either below the poverty line or even if they have jobs, cannot get by without food stamps or other social security. About four million families live on an income of less than two dollars a day.” The book also provides an overview of the state of the American economy, where he explains that only 20% of jobs are now in the manufacturing sector and 80% are in the service industry, with a large part of that including jobs in retail and the food industry. It’s the economy As an example, the book has a chapter on Walmart, the world’s largest corporation, and its treatment of employees. “We followed the story of a single mother who was serving at the food counter and fell and had an accident. She went and got a doctor’s certificate but Walmart fired her from her job because they said that doctors’ certificates were not good enough. People think of America as a fair and just society but that’s just not true.” Mr. Friedman argues that corporations like Walmart are the worst examples of exploitative capitalism. When he went to visit the woman’s home, Mr. Friedman said, he felt that slums in Mumbai are cleaner than her neighbourhood, and probably had more sense of community. “You can’t say this in Washington, but since we’re here we can talk about it,” he said. “The ‘American Dream’ probably never existed for black Americans, for several classes of women, and for poor whites. In the globalisation era, it’s actually been more propaganda than reality.” Post a Comment More In Mumbai politics (general) books and publishing Related Articles << Previous Story Next Story >> Please Wait while comments are loading...
