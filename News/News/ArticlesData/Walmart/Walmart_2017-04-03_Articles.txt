If the store carried Mexican brands, they would hang out and gossip with people who came to purchase them. Eventually they were connected with other immigrants in the region. Before Stewart’s study, the best estimates of the rural immigrant and farm-worker population in Ohio ranged from 15,000 to 18,000. Stewart’s group found there were actually 63,500 to 70,300 rural immigrants and farm workers. “There was a clear disparity between what people thought they knew, and what was actually going on in the state,” Stewart said. That led to the creation of the Immigrant Worker Project in 1998. Stewart, coordinator of the IWP, was at Youngstown State University on Monday to talk about how the Canton-based nonprofit helps meet the needs of immigrant communities in Ohio, especially when it comes to workplace rights. Stewart said the majority of immigrants in Ohio are coming from Mexico and Guatemala, and they’re coming to work on farms. Between 1997 and 2004, production on poultry and dairy farms more than doubled. Farms producing eggs and nurseries cultivating plants for landscaping also have seen an increase in output tied to immigrant workers, Stewart said. These workers often are vulnerable. Stewart told a story about a man who cut himself in a poultry factory. He was taken to a vet to get stitches and then returned to work. On another farm, chicken catchers saw their wages reduced when a worker injured himself. The employer said it was to cover the workers’ compensation payments. The Immigrant Worker Project helps these groups advocate for themselves and obtain better treatment in the workplace. They also provide education and help communities develop their own leadership. “We’re building from the base and empowering the base, so they can lead themselves,” he said. When asked about whether he should tell people to return to their countries of citizenship, Stewart said that would have little effect. Businesses want the low-wage workers, and immigrants are often fleeing terrible conditions including the civil war in Guatemala. “Think about a 30-year civil war in Ohio and 500,000 die – civilians, not combatants. That’s what they’re coming from,” Stewart said. Stewart said beginning in 2009, they started seeing unaccompanied minors coming in who were fleeing violence in their home countries. Georgia Kasamias, a YSU student who interns at the IWP, organized the event. She said most people in the Youngstown area don’t know the organization exists, and it’s a nonprofit that lacks funding. “I wanted to help market what they do and spread information,” she said. Stewart said the closest community the group works in is Salem. He acknowledged unauthorized immigration is a difficult issue, but he also said the current immigration system is broken. Also, America has some of the cheapest food prices in the world, in part because it relies on immigrant workers. Stewart asked if Americans aren’t willing to have immigrants come do this work, are they willing to see farming outsourced to Mexico or are they willing to pay more for food? It’s a decision most people don’t want to make, he said.

Live Watch Walmart footage is best lead in Tennessee abduction case, expert says By EMILY SHAPIRO Close Follow on Twitter More from Emily Apr 3, 2017, 4:56 PM ET 0 Shares Email Star PlayTennessee Bureau of Investigation WATCH Possible new sighting of missing teacher and former student 0 Shares Email It's been three weeks since 50-year-old Tad Cummins and 15-year-old Elizabeth Thomas disappeared on March 13, but investigators say they hope surveillance footage of the pair at Walmart will help crack the case. The only confirmed sighting of the pair has been at that Walmart in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, two days after they disappeared. The footage was released by authorities Friday. The TBI said that Cummins, who was fired one day after the alleged kidnapping, "may have been abusing his role as a teacher to groom [the teen] ... in an effort to lure and potentially sexually exploit her." Cummins is wanted on allegations of aggravated kidnapping and sexual contact with a minor and an Amber Alert has been issued for Elizabeth. The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation Pictured is Elizabeth Thomas, the subject of a statewide AMBER Alert in Tennessee. The March 15 Walmart sighting in Oklahoma City was nearly 700 miles away from the teen's home in Columbia, Tennessee. The photos showed small changes to their appearances -- Elizabeth's hair was darkened red and Cummins' gray facial hair was turned brown. Former FBI Agent and ABC News contributor Brad Garrett told ABC News today he considers the Oklahoma sighting the best lead in the case, even though it actually happened nearly three weeks ago. Tennessee Bureau of Investigation Police obtained surveillance images from a Walmart in Oklahoma City, from March 15, 2017, showing Tad Cummins and Elizabeth Thomas shopping at the store. "I think this photo and this location are terrific because it tells the public, at least in mid-March, that they weren't really going out of their way to conceal who they are," Garrett said, citing how the duo didn't alter their appearances in a major way, didn't wear disguises and went to a store that has security cameras. "If you're going be bold enough to walk into some place like Walmart ... you're going get caught on camera," Garrett said. "Tad didn't think through that, [which] goes to the unsophistication of his ability to be a fugitive." But, Garrett added, Cummins has figured out a way to elude law enforcement, which he thinks is likely by using a vehicle that authorities doesn't know about. The TBI said last week that "efforts to determine what vehicle they were traveling in [at Walmart] remain ongoing." Charles Crowson, senior manager of corporate communications at Walmart, said in a statement last week, “We are aware of this situation and will continue helping law enforcement with their investigation." The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation Pictured is Tad Cummins, who is on the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation's 'Top 10 Most Wanted' list. The TBI has received 1,328 tips in this case, 302 of which remain open and are being pursued, TBI spokeswoman Susan Niland told ABC News today. She called the Oklahoma sighting "helpful to us since it's the only sighting we have been able to confirm thus far." Missing teen, ex-teacher spotted at Oklahoma Walmart 2 days after disappearance Teacher visited teen's workplace days before alleged kidnapping, sister says Ex-teacher accused of kidnapping teen believed to have watched TV show about living off the grid: Sources Teacher researched 'teen marriage' before kidnapping 15-year-old: Police Josh DeVine, a TBI spokesman, said Friday, "We are encouraged by the sighting. ... They could still be anywhere, but [the sighting] proves that we need the national public to stay vigilant. We must encourage the public to keep their eyes open." While the case has now reached the three-week mark, Garrett thinks the duo will "eventually be found." Garrett said the Oklahoma sighting "gives me hope that there's going to be other sightings of them at these vulnerable junctures for fugitives -- which are food, shelter and transportation." Going forward, Garrett thinks law enforcement should focus on Cummins' friends, as well as places Cummins has a connection to. Law enforcement would likely "want to keep a very tight circle around Tad's friends and associates, both in middle Tennessee and around the country," Garrett said. Cummins will get desperate for money eventually, Garrett explained, since it would be too difficult for him to go to an ATM, he will likely reach out to his friends for help, so it's imperative that law enforcement is aware if he reaches out to those friends. Also, Garrett said, "I think anytime people are on the run, they still have to go in a direction where they think they can seek food, shelter and safety. And many times that means going to places where you have a history." For Cummins, that could be, for example, a location connected to "a former job, an ex-wife, children, former friends or current friends." The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation (L-R) Pictured are Tad Cummins, who is on the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation's 'Top 10 Most Wanted' list and Elizabeth Thomas, the subject of a statewide AMBER Alert in Tennessee. As the search continues, Elizabeth's family is praying and pleading for the 15-year-old's safe return. At a candlelight vigil in her hometown of Columbia, Tennessee, Sunday night, Elizabeth’s father said to the crowd of more than 100 people, "Without her, the house is just too quiet." "Please understand that she is not better off out there," he said, according to ABC affiliate WKRN. "She is better off here." Tennessee Bureau of Investigation The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation released a photo of Tad Cummins and Elizabeth Thomas at school in January. Authorities are asking that anyone with information call 1-800-TBI-FIND and that anyone who sees a car with Tennessee license plate number 976-ZPT call 911. 0 Shares Email Star Comments " Walmart footage is best lead in Tennessee abduction case, expert says " Trump campaign advisor Carter Page targeted by Russian spies " Redemption: Tar Heels take title over Gonzaga in ugly game " White House, Republicans trying to revive Obamacare repeal in new talks " Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon visits California " Trump admin cuts off UN agency's funds over abortion concern " Man killed after mobile home flips as storms batter the South " 2 survive after plane crashes at Olympic National Park " NHL ices Olympics, says no to 2018 Games in South Korea " 3 dead after boiler explosion " Trump says US is 'great friend and ally' to controversial Egyptian President el-Sissi " Tearful reunion between a boy and his neighbor's dog after a year apart " JK Rowling gives 'words of wisdom' to emerging writers " Olivia Wilde to make her Broadway debut in play of '1984' " Centennial of US entrance into WWI lures visitors to museum " Pa. couple pranks mailman with extra-long envelope " Thompson loses ANA Inspiration after day-old penalty " Twin toddlers re-enact their favorite scene from 'Frozen' " London attack victim stands on her own after broken leg " Barbershop finds success in out-of-the-box idea to get kids reading " Girl with rare, severe face cancer sparks emotion in 'hope' photo campaign " Lawmakers fail to override veto of Medicaid expansion " Mississippi LGBT religious objections law argued on appeal " Don't look for Congress to quickly pass overhaul of tax code " Trump plugs away at his central goal: undoing Obama's work " Homeowner arrested after killing intruder in his shower: Police " Japan envoy recalled over statue flap to return to S.

Jeremy Bowman (TMFHobo) Apr 3, 2017 at 4:43PM Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) announced its latest initiative in grocery this week. The e-commerce giant is taking the wraps off of its new AmazonFresh pickup service, which allows customers to place an order online and pick it up in as little as 15 minutes from a drive-in kiosk. The company is beta-testing two locations in Seattle, which are currently open only to Amazon employees but are expected to be ready for the general public soon.  Unlike the Amazon Go cashier-less convenience store the company is currently testing, which relies on a network of cameras and sensors to automatically charge customers, the AmazonFresh pickup service is not a new idea. Rivals like Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) and Kroger Co (NYSE:KR) have already opened hundreds of such pickup kiosks at their stores and are expanding them quickly. Wal-Mart plans to have close to a thousand of them by the end of the year. An uphill battle With its Prime membership program and e-commerce scale, Amazon usually operates from a position of strength, but that isn't the case here. The company is at a number of disadvantages as it opens another front in the grocery industry.  First, Wal-Mart and Kroger have a clear head start with hundreds of kiosks already up and running. If Amazon wants to truly compete with them, it would need to open hundreds of its own locations across the country. Without its own consumer-facing real estate like Wal-Mart and Kroger have, Amazon needs to find and convert space to open more pickup centers, a time-consuming, expensive, and difficult task. Economically, it's much more efficient for Wal-Mart and Kroger to provide such a service since they only need to build a kiosk in a store parking lot at one of their thousands of stores.  Curiously, Amazon's new pickup locations don't also offer customers the option of coming into the store, as most grocery shoppers still do. That means the company will lose out on impulse purchases from shoppers passing by the location, or from those who simply prefer to select their produce themselves. Building out what's essentially a grocery store without allowing customers to enter it seems like a mistake.  Finally, the service is only available to Prime members, and the 15-minute ordering window is exclusive to AmazonFresh members, who pay an additional $15/month for that service. With approximately half of American households already signed up for Prime, Amazon likely isn't losing many potential customers since those who would consider Amazon for food shopping are probably already Prime members, but positioning Fresh pickup as an exclusive benefit worth paying for creates an odd juxtaposition. Wal-Mart, the grocery leader, offers its pickup service for free, to everyone. Kroger's ClickList, on the other hand, costs $4.95 per order. The big question Who exactly is AmazonFresh Pickup for? In most metro areas, Amazon already offers its Fresh grocery delivery service, which, for an additional $15/month, provides same-day or next-day delivery to customers' doorsteps. And since the new pickup service excludes non-Prime members, the target market seems to be only people who pay for Prime, but aren't willing to spend the extra $15/month to get groceries delivered. After all, if customers are willing to place orders on their phones, the additional convenience of getting delivery rather than schlepping to the pick-up site seems worth the monthly fee. Image source: Amazon. With such a narrow target market, AmazonFresh Pickup just doesn't seem to make good business sense. Wal-Mart introduced such a program as a compromise between delivery, which it found to be too expensive, and the traditional form of in-store grocery shopping. The pickup service offers more convenience than entering a store, but less than delivery, and it carries no additional cost. That works for Wal-Mart because it already has the infrastructure and store network to make pickup easy and cost-effective. Amazon does not. The Fresh Pickup launch is clearly an experiment, and Amazon may not expand it nationwide. But 10 years after the company first launched Fresh, it's still grasping for a foothold in the $800 billion U.S. grocery market. The groundbreaking technology featured in the Amazon Go store has the potential to disrupt the industry, but the delay in its public opening is not encouraging. As for AmazonFresh Pickup, the service is at a disadvantage to competitors both from a customer perspective and a business one. For now, Amazon still seems stuck in a supermarket no-man's land.

The store remained closed as of noon Monday. Shea Johnson Staff Writer @DP_Shea APPLE VALLEY — A quickly extinguished fire to a clothing rack Sunday morning inside Wal-Mart during store hours is being investigated as suspected arson, a fire official said. The store remained closed as of noon Monday. The fire alarm went off at 7:55 a.m. Sunday at Wal-Mart, 20251 Highway 18, and Apple Valley Fire Protection District officials arrived five minutes later. AVFPD Fire Marshal Jason Nailon said the fire was out upon arrival "by employees with a fire extinguisher." Nailon added that AVFPD investigators were "working closely" with the Sheriff's Department and "exhausting all leads" to determine the cause of the fire. The store was closed from the time of incident Sunday and remained closed into Monday. A security guard who answered the phone at the store at roughly noon Monday confirmed the closure was still in place, but directed any other questions, including when it was expected the store would re-open, to Wal-Mart's media relations team.

B of A commits $1.5 million to boost Charlotte fintech effort search goes here Amazon Cash's secret weapon is the Apple wallet By John Adams Published April 03 2017, 2:48pm EDT More in Cash Mobile payments Retailers Bank technology Amazon Apple Print Email Reprints Share Share on Amazon is lending its considerable brand and heft to a cash payment model that borrows a vital piece of real estate from Apple Pay. Called Amazon Cash, the feature allows cash-carrying consumers to add funds to their Amazon.com balance by presenting a bar code to a cashier at a network of partner retailers. Users tell the clerk how much cash to add, between $15 and $500 at once, and the funds arrive instantly in an Amazon.com stored-value account. Systems like this are not new, and earlier models relied on consumers setting up a cash load online and then presenting a printed receipt, as was the case when Walmart introduced a similar service in 2012. Amazon's twist is keeping the experience decidedly digital, allowing consumers to store a reusable Amazon Cash bar code in Apple's wallet app or on the home screen of Android devices. Bloomberg News Amazon Cash debuted Monday in the U.S., and the initial retailers include CVS, Speedway, Sheetz, Kum & Go, D&W Fresh Market, Family Fare Supermarkets and VG's Grocery. Besides bearing similarities to Walmart's Pay with Cash service, Amazon Cash also resembles PayPal's MyCash card, which charges a nominal fee upfront for digital in-store prepaid loads to PayPal's account, and is a major part of PayPal's efforts to build a market among underbanked consumers. The key differences for Amazon: There are no consumer fees, and there is no physical card. "It's a bit of a defeat for PayPal, which is increasingly catering to the needs of the unbanked and would had loved to do a deal with Amazon to enable the unbanked to purchase there," said Rick Oglesby, president of AZ Payments Group. Amazon Cash also shares traits with PayNearMe, which works with a similar network of retailers but markets its service more for bill payment than e-commerce. Amazon's service could also be an alternative to prepaid card companies such as Netspend and Green Dot, whose products can give unbanked consumers access to e-commerce. "Amazon's service is open to anyone who has a mobile phone," said Richard Crone, a payments consultant. The system adds authentication through the phone credentials, the Amazon login and the consumer showing his or her phone at the retailer, he noted. "It pushes the entire prepaid market to up its game." Amazon can also pair the program with its strategy to build a brick and mortar footprint by tying some elements of traditional retail with its e-commerce brand. Amazon is building Go, an experimental store that doesn't require a checkout, instead using in-store sensors to charge a user's Amazon account for in-store shopping. Amazon is also opening a chain of bookstores, and is expanding its distribution and fulfillment network in the U.S. Amazon did not reveal terms of its deals with retailers, and did not return a request for comment by deadline. The launch of Amazon Cash comes at an unwelcome time for the traditional brick-and-mortar industry, as Amazon becomes larger than most big-box chains combined, and many big-box chains face traffic slumps and closures. "Consumers can access to Amazon for whatever you want to buy. And if Amazon takes this to its move to open stores, they can squeeze out even more," Crone said. "It would be like Trader Joe's for Amazon." Article Your Top CECL Questions Answered How should banks approach CECL implementation and can existing processes be used as a starting point?

Tech Apple Science Cars Samsung Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 Nintendo NES     Nintendo Switch Stock Shows Up At Many Walmart Store Locations And Online Posted: Apr 3 2017, 3:16pm CDT | by Luigi Lugmayr, in News | Technology News     New Nintendo Switch inventory flows in. Today many Walmart stores are reportedly having the Switch in stock. Updated. Nintendo announced last week that more Nintendo Switch consoles are on the way. The Mario company said the truth. Lots of new Switch inventory has been showing up over the past days. The red hot demand makes it though difficult to score a Switch for the regular retail price of $299.99. We have released a new comprehensive Nintendo Switch Shopping Guide with all the tips and tricks to find and buy a Nintendo Switch. Don't Miss: Today's Electronics Bargains at Woot.com Updates: 3pm ET: Walmart just sold again the Nintendo Switch console bundles starting at $368 online at walmart.com. Lots of shoppers confirm now in discussion boards to have found a Switch in stock at their local Walmart store.  Today iStockNow reports the Switch to be in stock at many Walmart stores across the nation. To find a Walmart that has the Switch in stock enter your zip code and select the Walmart store near you on this walmart.com page.  We recommend to check the stock information for your local Walmart stores on iStockNow and BrickSeek. The iStockNow live map provides the details where the Switch is in stock for Walmart stores. To check if a Walmart store near you has the Switch in stock you can also use this BrickSeek page. The Walmart SKU number for the Nintendo Switch with grey Joy-Con is 52901821. The Walmart SKU for the Nintendo Switch with neon blue and new red Joy-Con is 52901822. To check for the more rare Switch with neon Joy-con visit this link. If both services report inventory, than the likelihood is high that the store has indeed the Switch in stock. Competition is fierce. Getting out early is still mandatory to be able to score a Switch at retail locations. The reseller prices of the Nintendo Switch stay around $400, despite the restocking. Please avoid the fake low priced reseller deals on the Nintendo Switch. These offers are a scam. Read our report on the Nintendo Switch Amazon scam for details. Nintendo started to restock the Nintendo Switch two weeks. GameStop kicked things off with restocking the Switch in stores. Walmart, Target, ToysRUs and even amazon.com offered the $299.99 Nintendo Switch with Grey Joy-Con. The supply for the Nintendo Switch Neon Joy-Con version was much lower. The Nintendo flagship store in New York sold Nintendo Switch each day last week. Read our Nintendo Switch Shopping Guide to find a Switch in stock. The new Nintendo Switch launched on March 3 and as expected, it sold out on launch day. Nintendo's comments that there would be enough Switch consoles in March to satisfy demand turned out to be untrue. Nintendo now plans to double the production of the Nintendo Switch. The company plans to make 16 million Switch consoles starting April 1 until March 2018. The original plan was to produce 8 million Switch consoles. The colorful Switch is slightly harder to find than the console with gray controllers. The premium resellers charge is with 50 to 65% still much lower than it is the case for the Nintendo NES Classic. Nintendo is expected to ship 2 million Switch consoles in March for the global market. The number is too low and finding Nintendo Switch in stock after the initial launch batch sells out is very difficult. The Switch gave Nintendo their biggest console launch ever. The first 2-days of sales beat the Wii and all other Nintendo consoles. The $59.99 NES Classic continues to be also in extreme short supply and Nintendo is unable to ship a significant resupply to resellers in weeks. Nintendo sold through 1.5 million NES Classic consoles and the demand is by far not satisfied. It might take Nintendo until Fall to make enough Switch consoles to satisfy demand. The Switch will be one of the most popular Holiday gifts for the Holiday shopping season 2017.  For video game fans who have not pre-ordered a Switch yet, there are still chances on launch day. There have been midnight launches for the Nintendo Switch at several retailers. The online availability of the Switch is expected to be very limited on launch day. The Nintendo Switch is a completely new video game concept. It's a mobile console first with removable small controllers. The mobile unit with display rest in a Nintendo Switch console connected to your TV. The mobile unit slides inside the Switch docking station, where it also gets charged. The small controllers that are detachable from the mobile unit also slide onto a home controller. A new Zelda game will be amongst the launch titles for the new Nintendo Switch, formerly known as Nintendo NX. The Nintendo Switch games sell for $59.99 like the games for the PS4 and Xbox One. The announced Nintendo Switch game line-up includes Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Nintendo killed region locking on the Nintendo Switch. Any game sold in any region will be playable on the Nintendo Switch. The system will include the main console, Joy-Con (L) and Joy-Con (R) controllers, a Joy-Con grip (to which two Joy-Con are attached and used as one controller), a set of Joy-Con wrist straps, a Nintendo Switch dock (which holds the main console and connects it to a TV), an HDMI cable and an AC adapter. Two stylish versions of the system will be released: a version with a set of gray Joy-Con, and a version with one neon blue and one neon red Joy-Con. Both versions will be the same price.

Detective Sgt. Brad Holmes said that officials with the Walmart on Cloverdale Road called the police department this morning wanting to speak to an officer about the syringe that was found Sunday on a shelf. The photo had been posted on social media. Holmes said officers inspected the bag and syringe. The bag was found to contain glass shards made to appear like drugs. The syringe had not been used. "No drugs were located," he said. He said Walmart officials are reviewing their video to attempt to locate the person or persons who placed the items on the shelf. “We will continue to work with Walmart to bring this situation to resolution, but at this point it appears to be a terribly inappropriate prank that has caused significant concern,” Holmes said.  tom.smith@timesdaily.com or 256-740-5757.

Conor Friedersdorf Apr 3, 2017 ADHD Is Different for Women Maria Yagoda Apr 3, 2013 Kaveh Waddell Apr 3, 2017 Technology Share Tweet … LinkedIn Email Print Text Size A highly secured digital-forensics laboratory sits tucked inside an enormous complex of low, boxy buildings in Bentonville, Arkansas. To get in, analysts have to scan their hands and enter a unique password. Inside, they comb through video-surveillance records and spirit data out of devices that have seen better days, like a hard drive that had been crushed with a hammer and dropped from a third-story window. Despite the sensitive nature of their jobs, these investigators aren’t high-level FBI agents or foreign spies. They’re Walmart employees. Walmart is one of six companies in the United States that run digital-forensics laboratories accredited by the American Society of Crime Laboratory Directors. American Express has an accredited lab; Target has two of them. Those companies—and many others that operate labs without formal accreditation—have built up digital-forensics capabilities once limited to law enforcement. They have the tools and the know-how to investigate corporate theft and online fraud, or track a data breach to its source. That might involve extracting information from a locked, encrypted smartphone, or a damaged computer hard drive. Or it could entail analyzing network activity to figure out which employee, for example, is siphoning off sensitive data to sell on the black market. In many cases, private companies can do this much faster than the police. “A lot of law enforcement-based digital-forensics labs are just swamped,” said Kathryn Seigfried-Spellar, a professor of computer science at Purdue University. “Almost every type of crime—whether it’s homicide, arson, or a computer crime—is going to have some sort of digital evidence associated with it.” As a result, she says, the backlog of devices and data awaiting analysis at police labs can stretch from months to years. So businesses have taken digital forensics into their own hands. Labs have popped up in big companies across industries, said John Dayton, a forensic researcher at Carnegie Mellon University’s Software Engineering Institute. From retailers to banks, utilities, and technology firms, large companies have taken up forensics work on their own. In-house forensics allows companies to work faster, cheaper, and potentially better than law enforcement. Labs at large companies are more likely than police labs to have high-tech tools and the latest forensics software, said Seigfried-Spellar. Forensics equipment is expensive, and is quickly and constantly surpassed by new technology. Methods for extracting data from mobile devices, for example, have to be rethought every time a new smartphone with improved security protocols is released. But corporate labs aren’t limited to digital forensics. Some have expertise in more traditional investigative techniques, like fingerprint or photo analysis. Having capabilities in multiple fields allows companies to solve crimes that affect them, or that occur on their property. A big-box store, for example, can fight organized retail crime by investigating incidents at their stores. Related Story Hacking Tools Get Peer Reviewed, Too Once an internal investigation team discovers an incident, it will report the case to law enforcement and walk police through the details, said Dayton, who previously worked in the now-defunct National Drug Intelligence Center, an agency in the Justice Department. If law enforcement are preparing a civil or a criminal case, officers will work hand-in-hand with analysts at the reporting company to gather and interpret evidence. A detailed but unconfirmed post highlighted on Reddit’s official blog last year offers a look at that process. A user called “StiggyPop” wrote about getting caught after stealing about $15,000 in Blu-Rays from a Target store. Target investigators had assembled a file on him, he wrote, and figured out where he lived, what car he drove, and where he resold the stolen discs. He was turned over to the police and charged with grand larceny. The relationship between business and law enforcement isn’t limited to cases that affect a particular company. In certain cases, Target has said it offers to help law enforcement with its forensics resources for free. Target and Walmart both declined to comment for this story, but in a press release from 2012, Target said it volunteers to get involved with with “felony, homicide, and special-circumstances cases.” In 2008, a Target spokesperson told the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review that a quarter of the cases it worked on were unrelated to the company itself.

Nadine Ajaka Mar 31, 2017 About the Author Kaveh Waddell is an associate editor at The Atlantic. Twitter Facebook Email Most Popular Presented by Michelle Kondrich / The Atlantic The Unfit President Stephanie Hayes Unlike George W. Bush and Barack Obama before him, Trump doesn’t seem to care about working out or eating healthy. When Teddy Roosevelt was in office, he had the White House basement coated with mats. An avid martial artist, the 26th president wanted to be able to grapple and practice judo throws without leaving his home. Then the youngest man to assume the presidency (he was 42), he injected a certain vigor into the role: He invited accomplished boxers to the White House to spar with him, he led ambassadors on intense hikes, and he once livened up a formal luncheon by tossing a Swiss minister to the floor to demonstrate a judo hold. Thrice. Roosevelt was the only martial artist to occupy the oval office, but his enthusiasm for exercise fits a pattern that’s become more marked among recent presidents. It’s not hard to see the appeal of an active president to constituents: Being the leader of the free world is a demanding job, and it’s comforting to know the person filling it will make it to the finish line. The same clearly holds for Supreme Court justices, as evidenced by widespread liberal concern about Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s bone density and kale intake. (A recent article documenting the octogenarian’s workout regimen—a twice-weekly, hour-long circuit involving push-ups, planks, and weights—seems to have allayed some worries.) Continue Reading Natesh Ramasamy/flickr/Olga Khazan Meaningful Activities Protect the Brain From Depression Olga Khazan A new study of adolescents found that those who derive joy from selfless deeds were less likely to be depressed over time. Our entire lives, when you think about it, are built around rewards—the pursuit of money, fun, love, and tacos. How we seek and respond to those rewards is part of what determines our overall happiness. Aristotle famously said there were two basic types of joy: hedonia, or that keg-standing, Netflix binge-watching, Nutella-from-the-jar selfish kind of pleasure, and eudaimonia, or the pleasure that comes from helping others, doing meaningful work, and otherwise leading a life well-lived. Recent psychological research has suggested that this second category is more likely to produce a lasting increase in happiness. Hedonic rewards may generate a short-term burst of glee, but it dissipates more quickly than the surge created by the more selfless eudaimonic rewards. Continue Reading Yuri Gripas / Reuters Did Susan Rice Do Anything Wrong By Asking to 'Unmask' Trump Officials? David A. Graham A new Bloomberg View report says that Obama’s national security adviser wanted the names of Trump transition team officials in intelligence reports to be revealed. Ever since Devin Nunes’s mysterious announcement of supposed surveillance of Trump transition team members two weeks ago, the story has operated on two levels. The first is why Nunes behaved the way he did—with mysterious cloak-and-dagger maneuvers—and who he got his information from. It now appears that despite rushing to brief President Trump on his news, the GOP chairman of the House Intelligence Committee received his information from the White House in the first place. The second, and more obscure, concerns the actual material that Nunes had. He was cagey about it, in part because it is apparently classified. He said that Trump transition team members were subject to “incidental collection,” which refers to U.S. persons being caught up in legal surveillance of foreign targets. There was no indication of illegality, but the names Americans who are incidentally collected are typically meant to be redacted, and Nunes said some names were possibly improperly revealed, or “unmasked,” by the Obama administration. Continue Reading AP Photo / Alina Heineke What Does 'Cultural Appropriation' Actually Mean? Conor Friedersdorf An Atlantic writer and a Cato Institute scholar debate the utility and limits of the term. Last month, the long-running debate about cultural appropriation was rekindled when several protests over a painting at the Whitney Museum made national headlines. “Open Casket” depicted the body of Emmett Till, whose 1955 lynching helped galvanize the Civil Rights Movement. The artist, Dana Schutz, says the inspiration for the painting of the murdered 14-year-old came from listening to interviews with his mother, who displayed her late son's body during his funeral to "let the people see." Detractors argued that a white woman ought not render such a subject. And a petition called for the painting to be removed from the exhibit and destroyed. As debate raged, I asked Jonathan Blanks, a researcher at the Cato Institute's Project on Criminal Justice, if he would correspond with me about what constitutes cultural appropriation, whether engaging in it is wrong, and his frustration with the way some on the right are exploiting the backlash against cultural-appropriation claims. Continue Reading Maria Yagoda ADHD Is Different for Women Maria Yagoda The standard conception of the disorder is based on studies of "hyperactive young white boys." For females, it comes on later, and has different symptoms. This article is from the archive of our partner . When you live in total squalor—cookies in your pants drawer, pants in your cookies drawer, and nickels, dresses, old New Yorkers, and apple seeds in your bed—it’s hard to know where to look when you lose your keys. The other day, after two weeks of fruitless searching, I found my keys in the refrigerator on top of the roasted garlic hummus. I can’t say I was surprised. I was surprised when my psychiatrist diagnosed me with ADHD two years ago, when I was a junior at Yale. In editorials and in waiting rooms, concerns of too-liberal diagnoses and over-medication dominate our discussions of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD. The New York Times recently reported, with great alarm, the findings of a new Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study: 11 percent of school-age children have received an ADHD diagnosis, a 16 percent increase since 2007. And rising diagnoses mean rising treatments—drugs like Adderall and Ritalin are more accessible than ever, whether prescribed by a physician or purchased in a library. The consequences of misuse and abuse of these drugs are dangerous, sometimes fatal. Continue Reading Mark Kauzlarich / Reuters Trump's TV Obsession Is a First Elaine Godfrey No president has consumed as much television as the current one, or reacted as quickly or directly to what they were seeing. President Trump loves Fox & Friends. At 6:24 a.m. on Monday, Trump gushed on Twitter about the “amazing reporting” on the morning talk show. A week earlier he instructed the nation to “watch @foxandfriends now” for their exemplary Russia coverage. He tweeted about the program, hosted by Steve Doocy, Ainsley Earhardt, and Brian Kilmeade, seven times in March alone, and recently brought it up in an interview with Fox News’ Tucker Carlson, telling him cheerfully, “I like that group of three people.” Even after becoming president, Trump reportedly manages to fill his days with “plenty of television,” and from his tweets, it’s often possible to discern when—and what—he’s watching. In January, Axios broke down the president’s media diet: Continue Reading Aaron Bernstein / Reuters Going Nuclear for Neil Gorsuch Matt Ford Democratic senators have 41 votes to block President Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, setting up a standoff to rewrite the Senate’s filibuster rules. Updated at 4:18 p.m. ET Senate Democrats said Monday they have the required 41 votes to sustain a filibuster against Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch’s confirmation. Assuming none of the 41 senators change their minds before the final vote later this week, the Senate’s Republican majority will almost certainly invoke the so-called “nuclear option” to rewrite the legislative chamber’s rules and place Gorsuch on the nation’s highest court. Democrats crossed the fateful threshold during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing Monday, where senators debated Gorsuch’s nomination ahead of a committee vote. Delaware Senator Chris Coons followed Democratic colleagues Dianne Feinstein and Patrick Leahy in announcing his opposition to letting the nomination advance, becoming the key 41st senator to back the filibuster. “I am not ready to end debate on this issue, so I will be voting against cloture,” Coons told the committee, referring to the formal procedural mechanism to end a filibuster. Continue Reading Mike Windle / Getty Why Watching People Break Up on YouTube Is So Addictive Bettina Makalintal When internet-famous couples fall out of love, the result is an unsettling mix of performance and raw emotion. There are a few schools of social-media breakup etiquette. In my experience, most people simply hope that nobody notices their Facebook relationship status turn blank and profile picture turn solo. Some—as I’ve done in the past—temporarily deactivate their accounts. Others opt for vague sadposting. Only a brave few acknowledge the uncoupling publicly. For YouTube stars, though, the bar is different. If viewers know a YouTuber is in a relationship, the relationship—in all its #relationshipgoals glory—often becomes an integral part of the YouTuber’s  video stream, from daily vlogs of the couple to video tags like the ever-popular “My Boyfriend Does My Makeup.” Video stars not only document the relationship, but also publicize and discuss when it’s over—making the breakup an oddly participatory event, emotionally hard-hitting for both YouTubers and their viewers. Continue Reading Alex Wong / Getty Images Justice Thomas's Doubts About Civil Forfeiture Matt Ford The Supreme Court justice reiterated his wariness of the controversial police tactic earlier this month. A new Justice Department report seems to support his concern. The U.S. Supreme Court receives thousands of appeals from the nation’s lower courts each year. It declines to hear almost all of them. But for Justice Clarence Thomas, one of those rejected cases earlier this month gave him the chance to challenge a widely criticized police practice: civil forfeiture. Leonard v. Texas reached the Court after Lisa Leonard sought to overturn Texas’s seizure of roughly $200,000 in cash from a safe in her son’s car. In 2013, Liberty County police officers pulled him and his girlfriend over along what the state described as a “known drug corridor,” a law-enforcement term that can be applied to most major interstate highways. Officers seized the money and argued in local courts that the state could keep it, alleging it was likely the profits from drug sales. Continue Reading Netflix Five Came Back and the Frightening Power of Propaganda David Sims Netflix’s new three-part documentary series celebrates and analyzes the efforts of major Hollywood directors who depicted World War II. When the director John Huston arrived at San Pietro in southern Italy to film a crucial World War II battle in 1943, he was greeted with its aftermath. The small mountain town had been completely obliterated by invading Allied troops and the retreating Nazi army; more than 16,000 American troops lay dead as a result. Huston turned his cameras on the fallen soldiers, filming shocking footage of the war’s actual cost, but his plans to capture the actual conflict were dashed. So he did what any great director might do—he recreated it from scratch, having U.S. soldiers shell this already destroyed terrain, fight imaginary enemies, and mimic the horror they had just experienced. The resulting 32-minute film, The Battle of San Pietro, was one of the most pivotal war documentaries produced by the U.S. during World War II. Its brutal realism and unflinching depiction of the death, chaos, and sacrifice of the Allied campaign, was controversial enough that the U.S. Army tried to prevent soldiers from seeing it.

First, Wal-Mart is an awful corporation. Second, many of us end up at Wal-Mart regardless of that first fact due to any number of reasons — geography, selection, hours, sadness, boredom, etc.. Third, writing anything on the internet is perceived by racist commenters as an invitation to blindly spew hate, even if it's about something as innocuous as umbrellas, but the cowardly and ignorant most definitely brush their Confederate flags aside and earnestly get to action on the keyboard when you talk about the intersection of economics and social classes at America's bargain basement hellhole. (Which is ironic because until this summer, it was one of the few places you could reliably find the racist flag for sale.) Yelp reviews bare out all those truths and more in stark 1-star reviews filled with bile and worse. Which is all by way of saying if you comment here or on Facebook, keep your racist comments to yourself. Now that all that's out of the way... It should be said and it should be said publicly and it should be said forcefully: The Steelyard Wal-Mart Supercenter is the worst Wal-Mart in America.  If you do a quick Google search, that title, at least when it comes to search engine optimization and previous righteous tirades, is currently held by the Wal-Mart in Martinsburg, West Virginia. We not so humbly beg to differ. There's really no comparison. We'd regale you with the blow-by-blow that got us to this breaking point, but you've likely been there yourself. The lines that stretch across an acre or two as two cashiers do the best they can as a manager looks on with complete indifference. The pervasive lack of concern for anything resembling customer service so widespread and institutionalized that it couldn't be casual or coincidence, that the only possible explanation is a mandatory seminar all employees take to learn how to be so completely inept at even the most basic aspects of their job. The shelves that never seemed stocked, and when they are, stocked in such a manner as to create a portrait of a forsaken wasteland long shuttered from public view, the consumer version of ruin porn shots of defunct amusement parks or condemned warehouses. The waits. The waits for literally anything. To be rung up. To get photos. To have paint mixed. To, god forbid, check the inventory of an item not on the shelf. The parking lot, a cemetery of mish-moshed metal left over, we imagine, from a failed and abandoned experiment to build a Transformer entirely out of shopping carts. The store itself a miracle, an unobserved island of the Walton empire that they have long since forgotten about and probably assume had already closed. That is all. It's the worst. Please don't shop there. Don't make the same mistakes we've made.  Tags: Rants, Steelyard, Wal-Mart, Image Jump to comments (135) Tweet Email Print Favorite Saving… Share Speaking of...

The department shared images that appear to match the description of the teen and her alleged abductor, 50-year-old Tad Cummins, at a McDonald’s in Kearney, Nebraska, more than 900 miles west of their home state of Tennessee. The sighting has not been confirmed by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation. The TBI last released surveillance images of the two at a Walmart in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma on Friday. The footage was taken on March 15, two days after the teen was allegedly abducted. Related: Missing teen, ex-teacher spotted at Oklahoma Walmart 2 days after disappearance The footage, which was the first confirmed sighting of the two since they went missing last month, made the Thomas family more hopeful for her safe return, according to her father, Anthony Thomas, who spoke with ABC News on Friday. MEDIA: Here’s a quick video clip of Tad Cummins & Elizabeth Thomas entering the Walmart in Oklahoma City on 3/15.https://t.co/tIsI94rT6a — TBI (@TBInvestigation) March 31, 2017 The possible sighting came as more than 100 people gathered in Thomas’ hometown of Columbia, Tennessee, for a candlelight vigil on Sunday. The event’s organizers said it wasn’t about mourning, but about praying and pleading for her safe return, according to ABC affiliate WKRN. “We need you home because we love you and the house is empty and quiet without you. You were the one that made everybody happy and loved. You made the house really loved,” Elizabeth Thomas’s sister Ninita Thomas said to the crowd. ABCNews.com VIDEO: ‘Still in disbelief’: Family holds candlelight vigil for missing Tennessee teen Elizabeth’s father also spoke at the event. “Without her, the house is just too quiet. Please understand that she is not better off out there, she is better off here this community of people who care about her all of us,” her father said. “This community that knows and love her.” An Amber Alert has been issued for Thomas and Cummins is wanted on allegations of aggravated kidnapping and sexual contact with a minor. The former teacher has been added to Tennessee’s ten most wanted list. Related: Emails between allegedly kidnapped teen and former teacher reveal ‘romantic interest,’ says DA Cummins was fired from the Culleoka Unit School, where Elizabeth had been a student in his forensics class, shortly after the two vanished. Cummins’ wife, Jill Cummins, filed for divorce on Friday, citing irreconcilable differences. She also alleged that her husband was “guilty of inappropriate marital conduct.” Jill Cummins had previously begged her husband to come home and “do the right thing” while speaking at a TBI new conference in March, according to WRKN. “This is not who you are. We can help you get through this,” Jill Cummins said. “No matter how far you’ve gone or what’s happening right now, God’s grace is sufficient for you, and He wants you to come home.” Share this: Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Click to email (Opens in new window) Like this: Like Loading...

Jill Cummins decided to split from her husband of 31 years, Tad, after he disappeared with Elizabeth Thomas on March 13. Details of the reasons behind her divorce emerged as police in Kearney, Nebraska, shared what they thought was surveillance footage of the pair ordering at a McDonald's. But the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation later confirmed that it was not them.  Spokesman Josh DeVine wrote on Twitter: 'Images shared by a police agency in Nebraska have been determined to not be Tad Cummins & Elizabeth Thomas. Our search continues.' The last time the pair have been seen was on CCTV video taken in a Walmart in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma on March 15.  Scroll down for video Police in Nebraska released this still from CCTV footage at a McDonald's, suggesting it was missing Tennessee teacher Tad Cummins and his student Elizabeth Thomas. But investigators in Tennessee later confirmed it was not the pair Kearney police released CCTV footage showing the alleged pair in a McDonald's and a pickup truck they may or may not have been driving, but the sighting later turned out to be false  Thomas (left) and Cummins (right) have been missing from Tennessee since March 13 The court papers, obtained by WKRN, show that Jill cited 'irreconcilable differences' and 'inappropriate marital conduct' on her husband's part as reasons for the termination of their marriage.  Jill has previously spoken out,  pleading with her husband to 'so the right thing' and bring Thomas back to her family.  'This is not who you are. We can help you get through this. No matter how far you’ve gone or what’s happening right now, God’s grace is sufficient for you, and He wants you to come home,' she said.  It's believed that Thomas went willingly with Cummins, her former high school teacher.  Meanwhile, Cummins' wife Jill filed for divorce on Friday citing 'irreconcilable difference' and 'inappropriate marital conduct' on her husband-of-31-year's part.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Homeowner who found a 'naked' teacher's aide taking a SHOWER...

Share this article Share 113 shares Two weeks before they disappeared, a student caught the two kissing and administrators pulled Thomas from Cummins' classes, but did not suspend the teacher.   The disappeared together on March 13, and since then the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation has received thousands of tips.  But there has only been one confirmed sighting - on March 15 - at a Walmart in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.  The last time the pair was seen was on surveillance video taken at a Walmart in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma on March 15  On their March 15 trip to Walmart the two purchased a few food supplies which Cummins paid for in cash before hitting the road In the surveillance photo, Thomas appears to have died her blonde hair red and wears a men's plaid flannel shirt while Cummins' beard is turned gray to black. Video that was later released of the visit shows the two in discussion as they enter the store, with the teenager looking upset with the man wanted for her kidnapping.  On their March 15 trip to Walmart the two purchased a few food supplies which Cummins paid for in cash before hitting the road.   Cummins was last seen one day before the two disappeared buying hair dye at a Walmart, while wearing the plaid shirt that Elizabeth was seen in days later in Oklahoma. At the time is was assumed that this would be used to alter Elizabeth's appearance after he snatched the teenager, but it is now clear that is not the case. It was instead Cummins who was using the hair dye, making it unclear when Elizabeth changed her look.  Elizabeth, who is one of ten children, made frequent posts on social media about romance and love in the weeks before she was abducted by Cummins. She also started calling herself 'wife' on Instagram and made several references to a 'mission' that was 'almost complete'. On March 13, she told family she was going to spend the day with a friend. One of her siblings has since revealed that the teenager told them to call police if she did not return home that night. Authorities believe she may have gone willingly with Cummins, who they say has been grooming her for sex for some time. Elizabeth was seen on surveillance footage the day she disappeared carrying a bundle of clothes.  Elizabeth's mother spoke to DailyMail.com earlier this month in an exclusive interview to share her fears about her daughter's abduction. Cummins was seen at a Walmart on March 12, one day before the disappearance, purchasing hair dye (above) She labeled her daughter's captor as 'disturbed' and said she worried Elizabeth would either end up pregnant or dead. The sister of Elizabeth Thomas also spoke about the abduction on Good Morning America last week.  The young girl fought back tears as she revealed that Cummins had begun showing up unannounced at her sister's work shortly before the pair disappeared together, and that his last visit had come just two days before the girl's abduction. 'She would go and tell people to tell him she wasn't there and she would go and hide until he left,' explained Sarah Thomas. 'She thought it was the only way. She felt uncomfortable.' Elizabeth's family is still holding out hope that they will see the girl again, and are begging any person who might have information to reach out and contact authorities. The sister (Sarah above) of the missing Tennessee teenager said that Tad had been showing up at her work unannounced She would go and tell people to tell him she wasn't there and she would go and hide until he left,' said Sarah Thomas (Thomas family above) 'It feels like she just vanished, and I know that's impossible, someone had to see her,' said the victim's sister Sarah. Her father meanwhile was optimistic about the teenager's eventual return home to be with her family. 'We just live for that day where we are gonna get a phone call that says we're alright and waiting for someone to get me,' said Anthony Thomas. Investigators have also learned that the two had been sending love letters to one another which were at times sexually charged by writing draft emails on a shared classroom computer at Culleoka School.  They poured over email drafts that the two would send one another while in school for any clues into where the pair may be, with Cummins now facing charges of aggravated kidnapping and sexual contact with a minor.

Share this article Share 113 shares Those letters were all sent after a student witnessed Cummins and Elizabeth kissing in his classroom this past January.  'They would write the message and let it save as a draft. The other person would log in, read the message and then delete it and then write another message that was saved as a draft,' said Maury County District Attorney Brent Cooper. 'If you read them you would immediately recognize you are reading messages between two people who have a romantic interest in each other.' One of the emails uncovered by authorities was written by Cummins and began: 'I saw you standing next to your backpack this morning.' The teacher then told the student how nice one of her body parts looked to him in the note.   The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, which is leading the hunt for the pair, has received hundreds of tips but none have led to Elizabeth's discovery and safe return.  Anyone with information on the whereabouts of Cummins and Thomas are being asked to call 1-800-TBI-FIND.     Read more: New details on relationship between former teacher and missing student | Watch the video - Yahoo Good Morning America Tad Cummins¿ wife files for divorce amid ongoing AMBER Alert | WKRN News 2 Share or comment on this article e-mail 113 shares Most watched News videos Horrific moment bullfighter is gored by 1,000lb bull in Madrid Dogs surround shoppers in Bolton before owner leads them away The Hangover actor Mike Epps brings distressed kangaroo on stage Shoppers defend themselves with chairs against pack of dogs Shocking moment dangerous dogs are shot by police in Bolton 'It got Grandma!': Chimp throws poo into grandmother's face at zoo Couple paraded through streets after they become stuck during sex GRAPHIC: Video shows St Petersburg train moments after bomb attack Explosion on the metro in St Petersburg rips through carriage Smokey aftermath after explosion rips through St Petersburg metro Is this Banksy?: Woman claims to have caught the artist at work Las Vegas store clerk shoots 13-year-old would-be robber dead Horrific moment young bullfighter is gored through the...

Let Us Know! Welcome to the roundup of the best new Android applications and live wallpapers that went live in the Play Store or were spotted by us in the previous 2 weeks or so. Please wait for this page to load in full in order to see the widgets, which include ratings and pricing info. Looking for the previous roundup editions? Find them here. Featured App AccuBattery Today's roundup is presented by AccuBattery from Digibites. Barring any accidents, the battery is the part of your phone that generally wears out the fastest, so it pays to keep an eye on its health. AccuBattery tests your battery's effective capacity in milliamp-hours to see if it's deteriorated, including tools for live reporting and battery life projections. The Battery Alarm feature tells users when to stop charging to make the usable life of your phone even longer. -- AccuBattery protects battery health, displays battery usage information, and measures battery capacity (mAh) based on science. Batteries have a limited lifespan. Every time you charge your device, it wears out the battery, lowering its total capacity. Scientific research shows that battery lifespan can be extended up to 200%, when you charge your device to only 80%. AccuBattery measures the actual battery usage using information from the battery charge controller. Battery usage per app is determined by combining these measurements with information on which app is in the foreground. Android calculates battery usage using pre-baked profiles that device manufacturers provide, like how much power the CPU uses. In practice however, these numbers tend to be highly inaccurate. - Measure real battery capacity (in mAh). - Use the charge alarm to prolong battery lifespan. - See how much wear your battery sustains with each charge session. - Look up the discharge speed and battery consumption per app. - Remaining charge time - know how long it takes before your battery is charged. - Remaining use time - know when you will run out of battery. - Screen on or screen off estimations. - Check the percentage of deep sleep, when the device is in standby mode. - Ongoing notification for real time battery statistics at a glance. Pro features - Real time CPU and battery usage overlay for spotting battery draining processes. - Access to historical data of more than 1 day. - Detailed battery statistics in notification - No ads Download: AccuBattery (Play Store) Apps Screens - Multi Window Manager Android Police coverage: Screens lets you create shortcuts to launch apps in split-screen mode Android 7.0 includes a super-neat dual window function for apps, but just like on the desktop, it works better for some programs than for others. Screens is a tool that allows users to set shortcuts for specific combinations of multi-window apps, like YouTube on top for music videos and Chrome below for lyrics. Shortcuts can be used in any launcher. Of course, users will need to have a phone or tablet running Nougat to install the app. -- Screens allows you to quickly enter splitscreen mode with pre selected apps. It creates shortcuts that can be opened from any launcher. This might be good for productivity or having SeriesGuide and Kore at the same time. Download: Screens - Multi Window Manager (Play Store) Inkitt – Free Books & Novels Android Police coverage: Indie book publishing and reading service Inkitt brings its app to the Play Store Inkitt is a collection of freely-distributed books, novelas, and short stories on an independent platform. That being the case, the Android app is sort of like Amazon's Kindle, except that you don't have to pay for any of the content. The app includes a reading system with font and background adjustment, reading lists and offline downloads, and a personalized recommendation system. -- Find thousands of new fiction books on the Inkitt App and read them for free. Fantasy books, scifi and thriller novels, horror stories, mystery, romance and more. Discover hand-picked novels from all genres and join us on our mission to support aspiring authors taking their first steps towards publication. • Discover and read upcoming fiction books by indie authors for free (all in English) • Download fiction books and read them offline • Personalized reading recommendations based on your favorite fiction genres • Customizable background colors and fonts to meet your preferences • When reading a story, tap & hold to autoscroll   Download: Inkitt – Free Books & Novels (Play Store) SystemPanel 2 Android Police coverage: SystemPanel 2 now in public beta, mostly a visual makeover The original SystemPanel, a reporting tool that put all of the data points of your phone and tablet into one unified app, was popular with hardware junkies. The follow-up includes a much better Material Design interface with more natural organization, plus app data to allow users to find resource and data hogs. It works without root, but advanced users can unlock some extra functionality with root permissions if they want. At the moment the app is in a public beta, so don't be surprised if there are a few kinks left to work out. -- This is an early access/development release of SystemPanel 2. Please report any bugs or suggestions you have to [email protected] SystemPanel 2 is a re-imagining of SystemPanel from the ground up. The UI has been entirely redesigned, with the main screen now providing an overview of your device's recent behavior/activity. More detailed information is available from the left slide out panel, or by tapping on items on the overview page. Material Design is used throughout. Download: SystemPanel 2 (Play Store) Walmart Scan & Go Android Police coverage: Walmart finally rolls out its Scan & Go app to Android Waiting in line at Walmart sucks. Everyone agrees on this point... apparently even Walmart. This Android app allows users to scan items as they add them to their basket, then pay with a debit or credit card on the phone and walk out the door, never having to look a checkout person in the eye ever again. Keep in mind that you might need to have your purchase verified at the door... and also that at the moment it's only available in one Walmart. In Arkansas. Bummer. -- Scan products while shop, pay from your phone, and go – that’s it. Save time by scanning your items when you add them to your shopping cart. Then check out and pay with the app, and your receipt appears on your phone. Show the receipt to the exit greeter and you just skipped any long checkout lines. 1. While you are in a Walmart store, open the app and scan each item’s barcode. No barcode? You can look up an item quickly. 2. As you shop, you’ll see the running total of the items in your cart. 3. Check out and pay in the app. 4. Show the receipt from your phone on the way out.   Download: Walmart Scan & Go (Play Store) Toontastic 3D Android Police coverage: Google releases Toontastic 3D, a digital puppet theater for kids to create and animate their own stories [APK Download] Google's latest app for kids is sort of like Baby's First Flash Animator. Toontastic 3D lets kids modify or create characters, set them against backgrounds, and set up basic scripts for animation and sound effects. The tools are all simple enough for kids while allowing a little flexibility when they're ready to stretch those creative muscles. A photo import tool allows them to put their faces onto characters, and created videos can be exported for sharing. -- 3… 2… 1… ACTION. With Toontastic 3D you can draw, animate, and narrate your own cartoons. It’s as easy as play. Just move your characters around onscreen, tell your story, and Toontastic records your voice and animations and stores it on your device as a 3D video. Toontastic is a powerful and playful way to create interstellar adventures, breaking news reports, video game designs, family photo albums, or anything else you might imagine. Download: Toontastic 3D (Play Store) Stringify Android Police coverage: Powerful home automation app Stringify comes to Android and adds IFTTT integration Stringify is a more powerful alternative to IFTTT, which connects different smart home and "Internet of Things" gadgets together and helps you build automated complex flows between them. It's in beta at the moment, but the "flower" interface for building causal relationships between physical electronics and web services is already promising. At the moment it's working with most of the standardized automated home systems on the market as well as IFTTT for compatibility with more gadgets. -- The award winning Stringify app connects all your physical and digital Things together in one place so you can take better care of your self, your family, your home or just get more done. Easily create and add powerful Flows that automate your life. For example: + Secure your home and save money when you go to bed by automatically locking your front door, closing your garage, turning down your temperature and turning off the lights. + Automatically jumpstart every morning with the traffic report playing over your connected speaker, your lights fading on and thermostat set to just the right temperature. + Get gentle reminders to stay fit, like the blinking of lights and a message over your connected speaker. Download: Stringify (Play Store) Weather Wiz: Forecast & Widget There's no shortage of weather apps on the Play Store, but this one is attractive and themable, and it comes with a collection of widgets (not always a given these days). Local forecasts stretch from one hour to ten days, and colors and widget transparency can be altered to suit your phone's current look. The usual collection of weather data is included, and it supports imperial measurements (for God-fearing Americans) or metric (for everyone else on the planet). -- Weather Wiz provides accurate weather forecasts based on your current location or any other place in the world. The real time local weather forecast as well as the hourly forecasts and 10-day weather condition forecast can be found in this free weather app. Is the weather data reliable? Well, we use the IBM weather data as the weather station source to deliver precise local forecasts, and you can trust the real-time weather conditions and make plans based on the weather condition. Download: Weather Wiz: Forecast & Widget (Play Store) EZ Web Video Cast | Chromecast This app is a connecting point between unlocked video streams on the open web (like the ones you plug into VLC on the desktop) and your Chromecast, which normally can't host them directly. Once users put in the stream and connect to their TVs, the phone app works as a remote control. It's a handy little tool if you like to use open streams for regular events... say, every Sunday when your out-of-market team is playing. The app includes a mini-browser with search, bookmarks, and an ad blocker. -- EZ Web Video Cast is the best browser app that allows you to stream videos of online movies, TV shows and other media from internet websites to your Chromecast. While you are browsing web videos on the internet, EZ Web Cast automatically grabs the video URLs inside the web page and let you quickly send them to your Chromecast device. As a result, videos from the internet will be played directly on your TV. Download: EZ Web Video Cast | Chromecast (Play Store) Manufacturer And Tie-In Apps BHIM Android Police coverage: India launches BHIM app to replace cash with digital transactions This app is an official production of the Indian government, meant to offer a unified point of interaction for mobile digital payments (and hopefully help out with the country's currency crisis). It's off to a good start - dozens of Indian banks are already onboard - but transaction limits and a verification system based on QR codes mean there's a lot of room for improvement. -- Bharat Interface for Money (BHIM) is an initiative to enable fast, secure, reliable cashless payments through your mobile phone. BHIM is interoperable with other Unified Payment Interface (UPI) applications, and bank accounts. BHIM is developed by the National Payment Corporation of India (NPCI). BHIM is made in India and dedicated to the service of the nation. Download: BHIM (Play Store) Microsoft StaffHub Android Police coverage: Microsoft StaffHub is a workplace shift management app for Office 365 subscribers StaffHub is Microsoft's answer to Slack, a sort of all-in-one office team tool for chats, file sharing, calendar collaboration, and even timesheet management. The Android app mirrors the web interface, as is the case for most similar applications. In order for teams to use the tool, all users need to be on an active Office 365 subscription. -- Microsoft StaffHub is a cloud-based platform that slips work (and the tools to manage it) into everyone’s back pocket.

Is it worth using? Rohan J Singh Try the free one, it's like you have a track of when you charge your phone, speed of charging as in time taken to charge, some more details on app drainage and a detailed estimate based on your usage on stats like when do you usually plug in your charger and stuff like that, it's not a necesssary app but can give it a go to see for yourself fav battery apps are useless. SyCoREAPER Talking out of your ass because you clearly have not used accubattery. Accubattery gives battery health reports among other useful system information, it isn't a task killer or battery saver, it helps you exercise better charging practices. Tam Oor Can I LOL on this ^ :D What the hell are "Better charging practices" ??? SyCoREAPER Clearly another clown that hasn't used it. Use the fucking app an learn troll. Blocked. Heiro78 i think he means not leaving the charger plugged in for long periods, allowing the battery to drain to certain levels on a regular basis. not sure what else but those are some good things for any lithium batteries neonix Better charging practices: an example, as it was mentioned in the article above, is charging your battery up to only 80% to extend its longevity. :D The capacity of Li-Ion batteries degrades over time, with every charge. Charging a Li-Ion battery to full capacity or letting it drop too low causes degradation faster than if you always keep it in the optimal range. This has been proven in studies. Based on said studied, its recommended to keep your battery between 40% and 80% for the best longevity. Obviously you won't be able to always do this and need a full charge sometimes or can't plug it before it gets low, the limiting how much you do that will help ensure that your battery retains its full capacity over time. Because most people are unaware of this and simply let their phones drop to 0% before plugging it in and walking away until it's back to 100%, electronics seem to have a shorter battery life after a year or more compared to when it was brand new. dep Gsam is better. andyy Without root it's useless. And uglier. Vitor Gatti It's an interesting app and free. You should try it for at least a week (for better measurements) EmirSc i like it its very clean and to the point, love the charge rate to see how fast/good your chargers are Middlefinger It doesnt work on all devices, sometimes giving completely insane reading, and even when it does its reported 'health' and battery wear cycle information is dubious at best. It does have useful features though. Heiro78 i didn't like it because it added a constant notification to the lockscreen which i could not disable. it changed the lockscreen significantly for me and couldnt get used to it. Big Josh Agree. Dave Daveofferson It has a notification priority option in the settings. Set to minimum or low and it's practically invisible but there when you need it. William Worlde Holy...! It IS a very good app. After posting a couple days ago, I decided to give it a shot (even though I have the paid version of 3C's Battery Monitor Widget Pro). I bought the "PAID" version (that doesn't sound right...) last night. Caveats: 1: It does use quite a bit of battery to monitor battery use; oxymoronic, I think. 2: CPU usage seems to be high: Let me put it this way: If you've used AppyGeek (and which info-seeker hasn't?!), it uses as much resources! But, I'm not feeling it on my S7 edge. 3: Re 2 & 3 above: Although the app is telling me it is consistently one of the top 4/5 "heavy-duty" apps, I haven't noticed a hit in my battery. So, I'm not sure what that is all about just yet. Pros: 1: The info is VERY useful, even though you can't kill apps from within it; but you can make informed decisions - decisions I wasn't aware that I could or should be making before. (See SyCoREAPER's "helps you exercise better charging practices" below.) 2: It is VERY informative with links to their website with additional info. I've read some of the stuff which has made sense to me for the first time! See their write-up re: Battery University and make a logical conclusion yourself. 3: There is no additional, useless glitz like 3C's graphs, etc., as well as the majority of battery apps in Google's PS. (Read their site and you'll see why the majority of apps in the PS is useless.) 4: Quite frankly, you don't have to buy the "Pro" version to get the main benefits. I did because I dislike ads (I didn't see any, BTW) and I like to support what I think are good apps/devs. 5: I may be biased as I've been using another of their apps, DigiCal+, for some time now and think it's also very well done. So there you go: Some USEFUL info to help you make a decision. Lon Grove the Walmart scan and go app sounds great. This needs to happen everywhere. Wíliam Gonçalves Hello, I just published my first Android application. It is the "Mercador", it allows the user to create and manage shopping lists. Can you help me by rating the application?

SyCoREAPER I think I will go rate it negatively since you posed somewhere completely non-related and are begging for reviews. Big Josh Ya, just what we need, another shopping list app. Ever tried to actually go shopping with your phone, at a grocery store? Does not work well. William Worlde Hi Crider. Are you specifically pushing Digibites' apps? You've done pieces before with DigiCal Calendar app s your "Featured App", whose + (=paid) version I've been using for the past 2+ years, so I don't mind/care per se, but just wondering out loud. You know how easily we web people are easily influenced to buy stuff that's not always necessarily good. Artem Russakovskii It's a sponsored app, a paid placement. William Worlde I was using 3C Battery Monitor Widget Pro on my last device, LG G3 (actually, on my GNex too). I briefly used GSam too on my Nexus, but I didn't like the interface nor found it useful (to me!) back then. A ***lot*** of info is sent your way with 3C Pro, but just how much can ***effectively*** be changed on a rooted device to make a world of battery improvement? Not much at all I've found. Digibites' DigiCal is quite good, but somewhat lacking. As there aren't even any near-perfect apps out there, I'll give their AccuBattery a try, especially as a rooted phone isn't necessary to get some of the useful features they're touting. (My new device hasn't been rooted yet...and I'm in no hurry!) kaibosh You know... I love AP, and consider it the best Android news/review/etc Android set on the Net. That said, these 'X new and notable apps' lists and the ones where they list 50 games and such, they are completely worthless in every way and honestly other than a story about truly remarkable releases the whole notion should be scrapped. Load up all the 'best games from the last month' stories from this site and point one single app or any game of any kind that means anything, is worth anything, isn't tied directly to a single product that less than .1% of the user base could care about even if the app was worthwhile. This is as much about the stale state of releases for Android going on three years now, but please AP stop with these lists full of junk and stuff everyone already knows about. You know it is getting bad when the sponsored app that has been shoved down our throats for the past year is the most interesting thing on the list. Mukesh Majumder Awesome article, i am looking for the best racing games for my phone, finally found it in your blog(http://www.techfeast.co/) .. Thanks for sharing this through your post.

Daniel B. Kline (TMFDankline) Apr 3, 2017 at 6:00AM Target is adding more small-format city locations. Image source: Target. While the past year has been brutal for many retailers, with numerous chains either closing stores or shutting down entirely, there are some companies bucking that trend. These are retailers that have seized the opportunities created by a down market. Not every company on this list has managed to completely solve the problems created by the consumer migration to the internet, but most have managed to find a balance. For many of these chains, the misfortune of others has created opportunity. Some are thriving while others find their way in the rapidly changing marketplace. However you look at it, these companies are adding stores and growing at one of the most challenging times ever for retail. Dollar General is continuing its rapid expansion pace. Image source: Dollar General.  Dollar General Discount stores have generally bucked the current retail trend, and Dollar General (NYSE:DG) has been one of the leaders in that space. The company plans to open 1,000 new stores in 2017 -- that will come on top of the 900 locations the company added last year. Costco opens new locations every year. Image source: Costco. Costco Costco (NASDAQ:COST) exemplifies the idea that slow and steady wins the race. The chain has plodded along in its usual fashion year after year seemingly unfazed by industry headwinds and competitive jostling. In 2016, the wholesale retailer opened 29 new warehouses with 21 of them in the U.S. That followed 23 new stores globally in 2015, and this year, the company will continue with plans to add 31 new stores (17 of them in the U.S).  Wal-Mart has plans to expand in the U.S. in 2017. Image source: Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart Last year, Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) closed 269 locations, but it still saw net additions to its network. Over 100 of those closures stemmed from the shuttering of its small-format Express locations, which management originally hoped would be a source of future growth. Going forward, Wal-Mart plans to open 59 new locations in the U.S. in 2017. That is in line with its normal expansion pace, and that growth will include new SuperCenters and more Sam's Club locations. To service those stores and a growing digital business, Wal-Mart will open new distribution centers as well. Artist renderings of the new Target store design.

The chain expects to operate over 100 small-format stores within the next few years, including one in New York City's Herald Square. Furthermore, Target also plans to redesign 600 of its locations by 2018. Like the smaller stores, they will feature a modernized design highlighted by "glazed, large glass windows at the front of store, stenciled concrete floors and unique lighting throughout," the company said in a press release. "Additionally, the new design offers two entrances, each with a specific guest need in mind." One entrance will be for customers looking to shop the store. It will feature market-appropriate seasonal displays. The second location will serve grab-and-go customers looking for a quick snack or other fast-serve items as well as those picking up digital orders. Nordstrom has been expanding its "Rack" off-price chain. Image source: Nordstrom.  Nordstrom While many of its department store rivals have struggled mightily, Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) has done surprisingly well. The chain exceeded its earnings forecast in 2016 despite full-year comparable-store growth falling 0.9%. The company has been slowly growing its store footprint, adding five locations in Canada in the fourth quarter alone, along with 21 of its lower-priced (albeit still higher-end) Nordstrom Rack stores. In 2017, the company has planned one new full-line store as well as 15 new Rack locations. Image source: Marshalls.  T.J. Maxx and Marshalls Like many of the other persevering companies on this list, TJX Companies (NYSE:TJX), which owns Marshalls and T.J. Maxx, has succeeded by discounting. Both chains, as well as sister brand HomeGoods, offer a wide, changing selection of lower-priced merchandise. This model helps drive customer traffic as shoppers visit the stores more often, not knowing what deals they might find each trip. It has clearly worked well with the company delivering 21 straight years of comparable-store sales increases. In its past fiscal year, TJX Companies added nearly 200 stores globally. It plans to continue that growth in 2017 with the company having a long-term plan to add 1,800 more locations for a total of 5,600. And that only includes growth of existing chains in established markets. The company is launching a fourth concept in 2017, which the company will test in two locations. Hobby Lobby has grown by serving hobbyists needs. Image source: Hobby Lobby. Hobby Lobby Hobby Lobby opened 56 new stores in 2016 with more coming this year. The chain, which bills itself as "the world's largest privately owned arts and crafts retailer," expects to open 60 new locations in 2017, all in the U.S. That would bring its total number of stores to over 750. Between 1,700 and 2,500 employees will be hired to staff the additional locations. Dick's has seen a number of rivals go out of business. Image source: Dick's Sporting Goods. Dick's Sporting Goods Dick's Sporting Goods (NYSE:DKS) has been a rare success story in a market that has seen major competitors like Sports Authority go bankrupt, while remaining players struggle to stay afloat. Dick's has encountered its own challenges, but overall, it has managed to deliver growth in the face of increased online competition. In 2017, the company, which operates the Golf Galaxy chain as well, expects to open 43 new Dick's and nine Golf Galaxy stores. In some cases, the new stores will be converted Sports Authority or Golfsmith locations that Dick's acquired. Daniel Kline has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Eventually, members of Amazon's $99-a-year Prime loyalty program will be able to order groceries online and drive to a pickup location at a scheduled time, where crews will deliver items to the car. Amazon says orders will be ready in as few as 15 minutes after being placed.

SEATTLE — Amazon.com's latest experiment is a clear indication of where it's seeking a big chunk of its future bread and butter: the massive world of grocery retail. Last week, the e-commerce giant unveiled two grocery pickup spots in Seattle under the AmazonFresh brand. That's the same outfit that launched a decade ago to deliver groceries to customers' doorsteps in Seattle. It has since expanded to more than 20 metropolitan areas, from Los Angeles to London, but has failed to make a major dent against established supermarket chains, including archrival Wal-Mart. Groceries — a $600 billion U.S. market — are a critical nut for Amazon to crack if it's to unseat Wal-Mart as the world's largest retailer. Analysts with Cowen & Co. called the American grocery sector Amazon's “biggest potential source of revenue upside.” Dubbed AmazonFresh Pickup, the locations are designed for shoppers who make their purchases online and then select a time to pick them up. An Amazon employee at the pickup site will bring the bags to the shopper's car. The locations have been the target of speculation for months. Tech news site GeekWire first spotted construction at a location in August, but Amazon, even as it worked on the facilities, remained mum on their purpose. Amazon says that, for now, the locations are in “beta” mode — that is, available to Amazon employees participating in a test program. But when they open to the general public, they'll be exclusively for members of Amazon's $99-a-year Prime loyalty program. The company declined to specify when that would happen. Unlike the AmazonFresh delivery service, which costs $14.99 a month, use of the pickup locations is free, with no minimum order. Orders can be picked up two hours after purchase. AmazonFresh members, however, will have the special perk of being able to pick up their purchases in 15 minutes. Amazon is not the first to come up with so-called “click and collect” grocery shopping. Supermarket chains from Texas' H-E-B to Kroger and Wal-Mart offer the service. Yet Amazon may have an edge over its competitors because of the popularity of its smartphone app — about 30 million Americans use it on a monthly basis, says Cooper Smith, an analyst at L2, a business intelligence consultancy. “Clearly, this is a mobile play,” Smith said, targeted to “younger consumers, high-net-worth consumers.” “I wouldn't be surprised if five years from now you have Amazon stores along the major metropolitan areas along the coasts.” The AmazonFresh Pickup facilities are part of what seems to be a multipronged approach to unraveling the mystery of profitably selling groceries in the digital age. That effort is beset by difficult logistics and by shoppers' reluctance to buy certain foods, such as produce and meats, sight unseen. Brick-and-mortar stores play a big role in this retail re-imagining. One prominent component is the Amazon Go store, a pilot convenience store that opened in December in one of the company's downtown Seattle high-rises. The 1,800-square-foot store has technology similar to that used in self-driving cars; shoppers can walk in, pick up a product from the shelf and walk out the door without dealing with a cashier; the item is automatically charged to their account. Groceries are also part of a wider push by Amazon into the physical world, a campaign in which Seattle serves as a staging ground. In 2015, the company opened its first brick-and-mortar bookstore in the city. Recently, it announced what will be its 10th bookstore at another Seattle location. The New York Times reported that Amazon is also pondering brick-and-mortar emporia for appliances and furniture.

TriplePundit has been exploring the efficacy of boycotts, or lack thereof, and we could be on the verge of yet another test case. Retail giant Walmart has joined a growing list of companies to publicly oppose U.S. President Donald Trump over climate change and the rollback of the Clean Power Plan. That could set the stage for yet another boycott from the Breitbart organization. In recent months, Breitbart promoted boycotts of Kellogg, Nordstrom and Starbucks to no avail, so maybe the fourth time will be a charm. Walmart, Apple and GE zing Trump over climate change The news about the Walmart position on climate change broke last week. Bloomberg’s Christopher Flavelle picked out this money quote from a company statement: “This work is embedded in our business,” Walmart spokesman Kevin Gardner said in an email. It’s “good for the business, our shareholders and customers; if ultimately we are able to positively impact the environment in the process, that’s a win too.” Walmart is far from alone. Flavelle also cites Apple, quoted here in a joint statement with a number of other top tech companies including Amazon and Microsoft: “We believe that strong clean energy and climate policies, like the Clean Power Plan, can make renewable energy supplies more robust and address the serious threat of climate change while also supporting American competitiveness, innovation and job growth,” Apple wrote. General Electric also weighed in early on the Clean Power Plan rollback. Politico got the inside scoop from an internal company blog post authored by CEO Jeffrey Immelt: “Companies must be resilient and learn to adjust to political volatility all over the world … Companies must have their own ‘foreign policy’ and create technology and solutions that address local needs for our customers and society.” People are going to freeze in the dark…not By way of counterpoint, Flavelle teased out this remark from Robert Murray, CEO of the coal company Murray Energy Corp.: “People are going to freeze in the dark because of the destruction of the reliable electric power grid under Obama and the Democrats … Mr. Trump is doing the right things.” However, Murray’s position seems to be an isolated one. Major U.S. companies have been transitioning to renewable energy for years, and they are not likely to slow down. The movement heated up considerably in 2015, when scores of companies joined the Barack Obama administration in a concerted effort to support a strong U.S. position on decarbonization, in advance of the Paris climate talks. The administration’s so-named American Business Act on Climate Pledge launched in July 2015 with 13 companies, including Walmart. That number ballooned to 81 in only three months. Also in advance of the climate talks, in September 2015 nine Fortune 500 companies joined the RE100 pledge for 100 percent renewable energy. Walmart was there, too, along with Goldman Sachs, Johnson & Johnson, Nike, Procter & Gamble, Salesforce, Starbucks, Steelcase and Voya Financial. And those pledges were not all hot air. In 2015 The Rocky Mountain Institute’s Business Renewables Center totaled up the results for its initiative to streamline clean power purchases for the business community: “BRC companies now represent total annual revenues of $1.3 trillion, global annual electricity consumption of 41.7 TWh (equivalent to around 3.8 million American homes), and for publicly traded companies, a collective market capitalization of $2.14 trillion.” Here’s a snip from the BRC blog: “New corporate members include Autodesk, Avery Dennison, Cisco, Digital Realty, EMC Corporation, Equinix, Etsy, FedEx, Microsoft, Starwood Hotels, Steelcase, Workday, Xanterra Parks & Resorts, Yahoo!, and others. “New sponsors include 3Degrees, Affordable Solar, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Capital Power, Community Energy, Duke Energy Renewables, EDF Renewable Energy, Gaelectric, Iberdrola Renewables, Infinity Wind Power, K&L Gates, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, ReneSola, Renewable Energy Systems Americas, Sempra U.S. Gas & Power, SoCore Energy, SolarCity, Sol Systems, Tradewind Energy, and WSP Group.” The Walmart name pops up again here, too. Walmart was an early client of the Rocky Mountain Institute, calling on the organization to advise it on store and transportation sustainability back in 2006. So, are we going to boycott Walmart? Breitbart tested the Walmart boycott waters in December 2016, when it zinged the company for providing third-party sales of “Bulletproof/Black Lives Matter” clothing on its website, while banning the sale of Confederate flag-themed merchandise. Walmart quickly dropped the line before any meaningful boycott got under way. That looks like a case of no harm, no foul — the Bulletproof line certainly wasn’t central to Walmart’s business (or, for that matter, the third-party seller), and dropping it barely made a ripple in the Walmart pond. The Clean Power Plan rollback is a different story altogether. The threat of negative publicity was sufficient to force Walmart into a quick behavior change before the Bulletproof issue snowballed. But forcing the company to alter its behavior on climate change would require a substantial change in its day-to-day operations as well as long-term plans. Walmart has taken plenty of hits for its employment policies but it continues to set a high bar for action on climate change, and those strategies are deeply entwined with its business model. A 10-year relationship (and counting) with the Environmental Defense Fund is one factor that has enabled the company to reach deep into its own operations — and those of its supply chain — for decarbonization strategies. As Walmart raises the sustainability bar, the company will continue to come into conflict with Trump administration policies. That ups the opportunities for Breitbart — a staunch advocate for President Trump with close ties to the administration — to push back. So far, Walmart is walking a careful line on its support for the Trump administration. But in addition to climate change, the company also staked out an opposing position on Trump’s border tax. Trump’s travel restrictions could also become another point of conflict that makes Walmart ripe for a boycott by Trump supporters. Given the Breitbart track record on boycotts in recent months, though, the chances for a successful campaign are slim to none. In the meantime, Breitbart is suffering through a boycott of its own. The Sleeping Giants boycott campaign now stands at more than 1,700 companies that have blocked automatic ad buys from appearing on the Breitbart site, and it shows no signs of slowing down.

Gal Gadot's arrival in "Man's World" in this summer's Wonder Woman remains a couple of months away, but she's sent some advance scouts to prepare for her arrival, with the merchandising program for the next DC Entertainment/Warner Bros. movie already ramping up in stores. Ahead of the movie's release, Warner Bros. Consumer Products has teamed with Mattel to create a line of Wonder Woman toys, debuting Friday in a first-to-market release at Wal-Mart stores nationwide, as well as on Walmart.com. As part of the monthlong program, which ends April 28, Wal-Mart will offer WW-inspired dolls and toys, including an exclusive two-pack set of Wonder Woman and love interest Steve Trevor. A further exclusive rollout of WW toys will follow in May, with products by Jakks Pacific, Funko and Fisher-Price. Additionally, Wonder Woman merchandise from licensees including The Lego Group, Rubie’s Costumes, Bioworld, New Era, Hallmark and more will launch wide through multiple retailers internationally April 7. "We’re thrilled to bring Wonder Woman front and center to retailers worldwide in support of her first solo feature film," Warner Bros. Consumer Products president Pam Lifford said in a statement. "WBCP has developed an incredible assortment of trend-right products in collaboration with our best-in-class licensees, allowing fans of all ages to express their fandom and bring Wonder Woman's empowerment, inspiration and beauty to life." Directed by Patty Jenkins, Wonder Woman opens in theaters June 2.

Hunt, Sam Walton, Alice Walton, Don Tyson and Pauline Whitaker built a strong foundation of leadership and philanthropy for the region, Larry Young, CEO of Dr Pepper Snapple Group, told a crowd of about 800 on Thursday evening (March 30). “Northwest Arkansas is a place where giving back is part of the fabric of your community,” he said. Young spoke at the 26th annual Boys and Girls Club of Benton County (BGCBC) Youth of the Year Celebration at John Q. Hammons Center in Rogers, which helped raise awareness for the Club and celebrated accomplishments of the Club’s youth. The evening was hosted by Andy Barron, executive vice president for softlines and general merchandise, Walmart U.S., and Charles Redfield, executive vice president for food, Walmart U.S. The BGCBC “serves school-aged children in the NWA area, providing out-of-school youth development and family support programs, which support in-school learning, promote health and wellness, develop honorable character and leadership and mediate emergent family needs,” according to their website. Young shared his story of being a “club” kid since 1959 when he attended the Boys Club in Springfield, Mo. He said his time there shaped him into the man he is today, and he cited three life lessons that he learned. “First, I learned that I didn’t have to be a product of my environment,” Young said. “There’s a reason I’m a believer in the American dream and it’s because I’m proof.” He said his world as a child was mostly back-breaking work on his father’s farm, but the Club opened a world of possibilities for him. Fernanda Alcantara, Boys and Girls Club of Benton County 2017 Youth of the Year winner, speaks to the crowd. Alcantara also won the state title. “Without the Club, I might never have recognized the possibilities that were beyond those wooden fences. The Club widened my perspective, introduced me to great friends and gave me role models to inspired me to do more and to want more for myself,” Young said. Second, Young said the Club taught him to “swing for the fences and punch above my weight.” Today the Club emphasizes academic excellence, character, citizenship and a healthy lifestyle. But back in the 1950s, Young said, the stress was on “the three B’s – basketball, boxing and billiards.” “Basketball taught me drive, billiards taught me strategy and boxing taught me the importance of taking risk, no matter the size or skill of my opponent,” Young said. “All these activities helped me build character, confidence and leadership. They also helped me decide for myself what I could achieve, regardless of what others thought I was capable of.” Young used this life lesson when Dr Pepper Snapple Group spun off Cadbury Schweppes during the economic decline in 2008. “Back then the naysayers said we didn’t stand a chance. They thought we’d be annihilated. Lots of companies went under. Many thought we would, as well,” Young said. “But we didn’t go to survive. We went to thrive. That’s punching above your weight.” Young said the final thing the Club taught him was the importance of paying it forward. “It has been five decades since I first stepped into that Boys Club, but I remember the people who gave their time to me like it was yesterday,” Young said. He told of three men who taught him lessons on being a great team manager, looking for opportunities in the ring and helping him see the big picture beyond the end of a cue stick. “From them I learned that you build your future with your hands, your mind and your heart,” Young said. “These three men, each of whom had their own lives, families and careers, reached a hand back to me to propel me forward. The value of that is beyond measure and something I’m grateful for every single day.” Young then introduced Fernanda Alcantara, the Boys and Girls Club of Benton County 2017 Youth of the Year and winner of the 2017 Arkansas State title. The Youth of the Year is the highest honor a Boys and Girls Club member can achieve. The winner is chosen because they have overcome personal challenges and shown “outstanding leadership, academic excellence and dedication to making healthy life choices.” Alcantara told the audience of moving to the United States from Mexico when she was four years old and of the personal and financial struggles her family experienced as a result of her father leaving the family. She said the Club became her safe haven throughout her childhood. “While my dad’s absence left me feeling unwanted, the Club opened up their doors, ears and their hearts for me,” Alcantara said. “They’ve given me the confidence to succeed as the leader I am today.” Alcantara is Keystone president, student body president, and in the National Honor Society. She plans on becoming a trauma surgeon in order to work with Doctors Without Borders. She would also like to work for minorities in the political arena. Alcantara said she sees the youth of America persevering the same way she has and believes they will also succeed. “Our background does not determine where we end up,” Alcantara said. “Only you determine that. You get to write your own story. We are not our past. We are not the color of our skin. We are not our politics. We are not a test score. We are potential, waiting to be unleashed,” she said.

More Comments Tumblr Pinterest Reddit Digg FarkIt StumbleUpon TORONTO — Packaged food companies and retailers changed the recipes of more than twice the amount of products in 2016 compared with the year before in order to meet a growing consumer demand for healthier food, according to a new report. Companies including Walmart, Dole, Smuckers and PepsiCo altered 179,600 products to reduce the level of ingredients such as salt, sugar and saturated fat in 2016, up from 84,000 reformulations in 2015, according to the Consumer Goods Forum, a non-profit global trade association. The numbers also track a swift upward trajectory from 2014, when 22,500 products had their recipes rejigged. The most-removed product ingredient cited by manufacturers and retailers in 2016 was sodium, cited by 67 per cent, followed by sugar at 61 per cent and saturated fat at 50 per cent, the report said. Related McDonald’s to serve up fresh beef on one of its burgers — but it’s not the Big Mac Amazon wants Cheerios, Oreos and other brands to make their products to be shipped, not sold at Wal-Mart Conversely, whole grains and vitamins were the most likely new ingredients added to boost the nutritional profile of food, at 25 per cent and 20 per cent, respectively. “Salt and sugar — the two are the new tobaccos” in terms of consumer perception, said Sylvain Charlebois, agriculture expert and Dean of management at Dalhousie University in Halifax. “The centre of the store is changing. Health and well-being are aspects that consumers are looking for (in products) and those will occupy the centre store more in the future and that also plays into the grocers’ own strategies around private labels,” he said. “And because the line between food service and food retail is blurring, grocers are trying to take advantage of that trend of offering consumers ready-to-eat, healthy products.” That has played out at Loblaw Cos., which has converted dozens of its Shoppers Drug Mart stores across the country to incorporate fresh convenience food. While Shoppers has long been a convenience destination for packaged snacks, there has been significant fresh food growth at the drug and cosmetics retailer. “We have strong growth pretty much across the board in the front store at Shoppers Drug Mart,” Loblaw chief executive Galen Weston told investors on the company’s third-quarter conference call last November. “We think part of what is driving that is the enhanced (fresh) food proposition that may actually be driving more traffic, more visits,” and that volume seemed to lead to higher sales in other categories, he said. “Where we see really, really significant success in adding fresh food is in the urban market.” Beyond catering to consumers’ desire to eat healthier, the trend highlights the response from grocery retailers and food manufacturers to the so-called “centre-store erosion” in grocery stores, a phenomenon which has seen consumers eschew packaged goods in favour of fresh food and the ready-to eat foods on the periphery of the stores. Sales of packaged foods has been tepid in Canada for years, growing at a combined annual rate of 2.4 per cent per annum between 2011 and 2016, according to market research firm Euromonitor. Retailers and manufacturers are increasingly teaming up in order to influence communities “across a broad and more holistic set of health indicators,” the Consumer Goods Forum report noted. “We aim to oversee the design and execution of several collaborative pilots to test the hypothesis that retailers and manufacturers can jointly create healthier practices and help people live healthier lives.” Unilever, maker of products such as Knorr soups, Lipton teas, Hellman’s mayonnaise, and Dove skin products has posted its commitment to making healthier food on its website. “More than 1.9 billion adults, 39 per cent of the global population — are overweight and 13 per cent are obese,” the site says. Unilever says by 2020, it will double the proportion of its food portfolio that meets the highest global nutrition standards. “This will help hundreds of millions of people to achieve a healthier diet,” Unilever says. “The business case is compelling. We have seen that by promoting hygiene and nutritious food, sales increase.” Cereal in particular has been a hard-hit packaged food category as more consumers eat on the run in the morning and look for more portable and protein-rich breakfast options. In response, packaged goods makers have been adding protein to breakfast and snack bars. “As we come into the beginning of this year, we’ve renovated even more of our food,” Paul Norman, president of Kellogg North America, told analysts during the cereal maker’s fourth quarter conference call in February. “Where we have renovated so far, we’ve seen better performance.” The Consumer Goods Forum is comprised of about 400 members including retailers, manufacturers and consumer service businesses.

The long list includes household names such as Starbucks, Pepsi, Walmart, Tesco, the BBC and the UK government. Some have even suggested that they may have inadvertently sponsored extremist and hateful groups to the tune of more than £250,000. To understand how, it’s helpful to recall how Google services such as YouTube work. When we watch a video clip we may see ads and we often skip them. But for Google the ad is the important thing – something like 90% of its revenue comes from selling ads. When an ad is placed around a YouTube video, Google charges the advertiser and shares some of the revenue with the user who posted the video. Vloggers such as Zoella make a pretty penny from this. Google’s targeting technologies can allow advertisers to place their ads around specific types of videos or present them to specific groups of viewers. So what’s the problem? Surely it is acceptable for brands to choose which content they sponsor? Isn’t this what happens on traditional media? Given that brands can target their ads already perhaps something else is going on. Over the firewall Brands certainly have the right to demand which content their ads appear alongside. On traditional media, a brand might not want its ads placed alongside a report about a terror campaign, for example. But it is not considered acceptable for them to say that the newspaper shouldn’t report such events at all. To get around this, traditional media companies separate news and information operations from advertising operations. The problem with services like Google and other social media platforms is that such organisational firewalls don’t exist. As a result, there are potential hidden biases that can come about when advertisers insist that content matches their “company values”. Ironically enough, this problem is spelled out pretty well in a 1998 paper by Google’s founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page. They wrote that the “goals of the advertising business model do not always correspond to providing quality search to users”. The example they cited from a prototype version of Google saw a search for mobile phones pull up a study which went into detail about the risks of speaking on a phone while driving. They concluded that a search engine company which was taking money for mobile phone ads would struggle to justify that kind of search result to paying advertisers. Brin and Page concluded that: Advertising funded search engines will be inherently biased towards the advertisers and away from the needs of the consumers. That belief underpins why Google search separates out advertising sponsored links from organic search results. On YouTube, however, responsibility for the content of videos and the placement of ads is delegated onto viewers, users and brands through its terms of service and advertising policies. Indeed, from my analysis of 45 published cases by the UK’s Advertising Standards Authority that involved YouTube, there were 44 in which YouTube responded that users, viewers and brands were responsible for the ads people saw on the service – not them. In just a single case, did YouTube accept that an ad should be taken down following a complaint to the ASA. So, one way of looking at the current boycott is that’s it’s a case of brands pushing responsibility for content and placement back onto Google/YouTube who, up to now, have been very successful in passing this responsibility onto brands and user. Weeding There is another way of looking at it, and that is as an indirect way for brands to claim more power over the type of content that people can share online. If Google has to “weed out extremist views” (as politicians such as Yvette Cooper have requested), it has to define what is extremist. The problem here is that Google’s approach to consulting with other institutions about how it operates is often spiky – as their engagement with the ASA illustrates. If they only listen to what brands want, it leaves them very susceptible to the types of insidious biases that Brin and Page spoke about in their 1998 paper: see its definition of “advertiser-friendly content”. Might they start to direct viewers towards advertising-friendly content? They could, for example, push other content down their search results and recommended video lists. So what does Google do next in the stand off with the big brands? Chief Business Officer Philip Schindler told Bloomberg that the firm has improved its ability to flag offending videos and immediately disable ads. He also revealed that giant health products firm, Johnson & Johnson, has rolled back its boycott in some major markets. More broadly though, the solution is for Google to be far more transparent and engaged in the societies in which it operates. It needs to respond to brands and consumers but other social institutions as well. We all have to decide what is acceptable, not an algorithm, brands, politicians or individual YouTube viewers.

Brin and Page concluded that: Advertising funded search engines will be inherently biased towards the advertisers and away from the needs of the consumers. That belief underpins why Google search separates out advertising sponsored links from organic search results. On YouTube, however, responsibility for the content of videos and the placement of ads is delegated onto viewers, users and brands through its terms of service and advertising policies. Indeed, from my analysis of 45 published cases by the UK’s Advertising Standards Authority that involved YouTube, there were 44 in which YouTube responded that users, viewers and brands were responsible for the ads people saw on the service – not them. In just a single case, did YouTube accept that an ad should be taken down following a complaint to the ASA. So, one way of looking at the current boycott is that’s it’s a case of brands pushing responsibility for content and placement back onto Google/YouTube who, up to now, have been very successful in passing this responsibility onto brands and user. Weeding There is another way of looking at it, and that is as an indirect way for brands to claim more power over the type of content that people can share online. If Google has to “weed out extremist views” (as politicians such as Yvette Cooper have requested), it has to define what is extremist. The problem here is that Google’s approach to consulting with other institutions about how it operates is often spiky – as their engagement with the ASA illustrates. If they only listen to what brands want, it leaves them very susceptible to the types of insidious biases that Brin and Page spoke about in their 1998 paper: see its definition of “advertiser-friendly content”. Might they start to direct viewers towards advertising-friendly content? They could, for example, push other content down their search results and recommended video lists. So what does Google do next in the stand off with the big brands? Chief Business Officer Philip Schindler told Bloomberg that the firm has improved its ability to flag offending videos and immediately disable ads. He also revealed that giant health products firm, Johnson & Johnson, has rolled back its boycott in some major markets. More broadly though, the solution is for Google to be far more transparent and engaged in the societies in which it operates. It needs to respond to brands and consumers but other social institutions as well. We all have to decide what is acceptable, not an algorithm, brands, politicians or individual YouTube viewers.

Share Tweet Share Email Comments Print The three best-performing teams last week in The Blade’s School Stock Contest had one major thing in common: All held shares of Tesla Inc. The California-based electric car maker had a big week, with shares gaining almost 6 percent. Enlarge Between that and solid returns from Best Buy, J.C. Penney, and Wal-Mart, the JDMR team from Springfield High School moved up an impressive 34 spots to begin the final quarter of the contest just outside the top 10 after nine weeks of the 12-week contest. Bonita Adams, who teaches business classes at Springfield and is advising a number of teams this year, including JMDR, said she’s tried to tell her students one big week could put them back in play. “Some of them that were kind of on the bottom would get a little discouraged, and I would tell them you can’t get discouraged,” she said. “Anything can happen and change. Even this team at one point, they were like second or third and they dropped way down. You just never know.” JMDR was actually in the red after week eight. But the 7.2 percent gain in week nine now has them up 7.1 percent and in 11th place. The annual stock contest gives participating teams a hypothetical $40,000 to be split evenly among four U.S. stocks. After 12 weeks, the team whose portfolio has grown the most will take home the top prize. This year, the first place team and school will get $1,500, second place gets $250, and third place $100. The contest is sponsored by University of Toledo’s College of Business and Innovation, which is tabulating the results, Fifth Third Bank, The Blade’s Newspaper in Education program, and the Taylor Automotive Family. This year’s contest is happening in what has shaped up to be a strong year for securities. “Overall market performance has been good,” said Ron Belle, senior vice president and the top regional investment adviser for Fifth Third, Year to date, all the major averages have had positive growth. The Nasdaq has had the largest increase — more than 10 percent — followed by S&P’s 500 index at 6 percent and the Dow over 5 percent.” With three weeks left, 56 of the 85 participating teams’ portfolios have returned positive gains. For the second straight week, the GBumpus team of St. John’s Jesuit Academy held the top spot. The team, whose holdings are Owens Corning, Cedar Fair, Advanced Micro Devices Inc., and Sony Corp., had turned its $40,000 into $45,339.81 through nine weeks, a gain of more than 13 percent. Second place was held by Alpha from Rossford Junior High School, while third place was held by by Klang, from Chase STEM Academy. Each of those teams are up about 9.6 percent. With several economic reports still to come in April and first quarter earnings reports not too far away, there’s still plenty of chance for a shake up. Contest teams holding Tesla already have seen big movement. Shares soared more than 7 percent on Monday as investors reacted to news over the weekend that Tesla had delivered a record 25,000 vehicles in the year’s first quarter. That’s 69 percent higher than the first quarter of 2016. Here are the Week 9 standings, with team name, school, city, and portfolio amount. 1.

Cops are investigating. Hancock sheriff’s officials are with Waveland police at the scene of a possible child abduction that occurred in the woods near the Waveland Wal-Mart. Wesley Muller wmuller@sunherald.com Authorities from multiple law enforcement agencies in Hancock County are at the scene of a possible child abduction in the woods near Wal-Mart in Waveland. Wesley Muller wmuller@sunherald.com 1 of 3 i By Wesley Muller wmuller@sunherald.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story WAVELAND After responding to a report of a possible child abduction near the Waveland Wal-Mart, authorities believe a witness may have seen a man grabbing a child and walking through the woods to a nearby apartment complex.   Hancock County sheriff’s Chief Deputy Don Bass said they received a third-party report of a girl being abducted from the store about 7:30 p.m. Waveland Police Chief David Allen said a woman flagged down a Hancock County sheriff’s deputy and told him she saw a man take a girl by her hair into the woods from the parking lot. The witness told authorities the girl appeared to be about 7 years old. No one has come forward to report their child missing, Allen said. As authorities searched the woods Monday night, Bass said a Waveland police officer saw a man and approached him. The man, who did not have a child with him, saw the police officer and ran. A chase ensued, but the man got away, Bass said. By 10 p.m., the man was still at-large. Authorities on scene said the incident occurred on the woods line to the west of Wal-Mart and not in the actual parking lot. Surveillance footage from the store did not show the incident. However, the description of the man given by the witness matches surveillance footage of a man pulling on car doors in the parking lot around the same time the alleged abduction was reported. Police formed a perimeter around the entire property and the woods and deployed a canine search team. At 10 p.m., authorities still had not found a child or received a report of a missing child and began clearing the scene. There are several paths through the woods that lead to the nearby apartment complex. Residents of that complex often walk through the wooded area to get to the store and walk home.

Workers who feel they aren’t represented may look for another outlet to express their views. Protests in France demonstrate how violent these outlets can become. Jean-Paul Pelissier/Reuters Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger Business groups in Australia have been engaged in a long-term effort to increase the legal regulation of unions to constrain union activities. But this crackdown on the traditional union movement has created a void starting to be filled by “alt-unionism” - a more amorphous, less predictable vehicle for workers to voice their dissatisfaction. Arguably the restriction of union activity has had some success. For example, the legal right to strike is heavily circumscribed, as highlighted by new secretary of the ACTU Sally McManus. In addition to this the Australian Building and Construction Commission has been re-established meaning tighter restriction on the activities of building unions. Over the past 30 years the percentage of unionists in liberal market economies has been falling. In the wake of this decline steps alt-unionism (also known as “alt-labor” and “improvisational unionism”). It operates outside the established processes of collective bargaining to improve the wages and conditions of workers by other means. Alt-unionism is a catch-all term that can refer to spontaneous actions by workers that don’t conform to the traditional pattern of strike behaviour or other industrial action. An example of this is the numerous protests by Uber drivers in Australia and around the world. It’s also characterised by the fluid campaigns (often digital) launched outside of regular channels of representation. Take for example the online petition signed by Starbucks workers and individual supporters last year that resulted in an increase of up to 15% for Starbucks US employees. Alt-unionism can also refer to relatively stable associations of workers that aren’t registered organisations in the way traditional unions are and consequently are not constrained by the institutional history and rules of formal unions. These organisations are also not subject to the specific provisions of labour law aimed at regulating union activity. These organisations in Australia include those representing rideshare drivers, such as the Rideshare drivers association and Rideshare Drivers United and others like the Retail and Fast Food Workers Union, an unregistered body. In the US, the Freelancers Union and the Independent Drivers Guild each have thousands of members but are not allowed to represent these members in the same way as other unions, because their members are notionally independent contractors. Why businesses should take notice of alt-unionism The rise of alt-unionism may not seem like an immediate threat to businesses. Many of its manifestations are ad hoc and small scale and consequently easy to ignore. However, alt-unionism is not uniformly institutionalised and its constituency is broader than a workplace or even an industry. Its development is erratic and much more difficult to contain through existing systems of industrial regulation such as tribunals. Also, it’s often focused on inflicting reputational damage on a business in order to leverage an outcome by meshing workers’ grievances and concerns of ethical consumer groups. For example, the OUR Walmart campaign in the US leveraged the anti-sweatshop movements and the Walmart bribery scandal in Mexico to support their actions for better working conditions at Walmart and in the retail industry. Walmart was also confronted with unprecedented alt-unionism in China, where a spontaneous movement lead to strikes across the country. In our ongoing research into the experience of rideshare drivers in Australia and the US, the main frustration expressed by drivers is the lack of a way to channel their voices. One New York member of the Independent Drivers Guild noted that: Before the guild the drivers had no voice – no one was listening, no-one was caring. Workers whose concerns are not heard through established mechanisms may look for other modes of association and voice. This may expose business to potentially robust and unpredictable reaction from workers. The most recent example is from France. Uber faced a coalition of the old transport union and the new independent association of drivers to contest changes to the pricing policy that resulted in reductions in commissions received by drivers. Protests and sporadic violence led to the appointment of a public mediator. Negotiations to date have been unsuccessful and a continuing impasse might lead to a state-regulated minimum price which is counter to Uber’s business model. Though unprecedented in recent decades, business could acknowledge some of the problems with the industrial relations system from the union side. It could seek to improve the system to allow unions a legitimate place, with the capacity to adequately represent workers. After all, Australia is at historic lows of industrial action and most employers never have to deal with it. But if the system continues to reduce the capacity of unions to undertake their representative role - we may see worker dissatisfaction expressed through action. This might not be the known type of garden variety industrial action - namely strikes during bargaining - but an increase in a spontaneous phenomenon, not bounded by the Fair Work Act or whatever supersedes it. This could pose a challenge for business and make current industrial relations settings and traditional unions seem - if not attractive - then perhaps at least palatable.

By Seth Fiegerman NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Google is pulling out all the stops to win back advertisers after a big brand boycott last month over extremist content. So far, though, many brands are still playing hard to get. A spokesperson for Google said Monday it will begin working with "trusted" third-party firms to better identify offensive YouTube content that brands may not want to place ads next to. Google also said it is now relying on artificial intelligence to pinpoint content that could be objectionable to advertisers. An investigation published last month by The Times in London revealed that ads from companies like the BBC and L'Oreal were placed near content on YouTube posted by religious extremists, a Ku Klux Klan leader and more. That finding prompted an advertiser exodus in the UK and US. AT&T, Verizon, Walmart, Johnson & Johnson, JPMorgan Chase and others all confirmed suspending ads on YouTube. Despite Monday's announcement, reps for AT&T, Verizon, General Motors and FX Networks told CNNTech there is no reversal yet of their earlier decisions to halt ads. (AT&T has agreed to acquire Time Warner, the parent company of CNN. The deal is pending regulatory approval.) Other brands, including Coca Cola, Walmart, Starbucks and Chase, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Only Johnson & Johnson confirmed changing its mind -- in select markets. "Johnson & Johnson has resumed YouTube digital advertising in a number of select countries following the implementation of increased brand protection measures by Google," Carol Goodrich, a spokeswoman for Johnson & Johnson, said in a statement. The muted brand reaction highlights the challenge Google faces in fully moving past this advertiser outcry. "For larger marketers, any one instance of an inappropriate brand placement may be enough to seriously harm a brand's business value," Brian Wieser, an analyst with Pivotal Research Group, wrote in an investor note last month that raised concerns about the issue. James Cakmak, an analyst with Monness, Crespi, Hardt, argues the ongoing brand boycott is a "power play" to get concessions from the Internet advertising giant. "If there was a window to take back some of that leverage, they took it," Cakmak told CNNTech. But it will be temporary, he adds. "At the end of the day, you can't ignore a platform with over one billion users." Cakmak estimates the financial hit to Google from the boycott could be as much as $500 million -- a significant sum, but a small amount for a company that posted $26 billion in sales last quarter.

Letters to the Editor Follow @csteditorials Proponents of legislation to raise the retail theft felony threshold claim it would save the state money, decrease jail populations and keep first time offenders out of prison. But what they won’t acknowledge is stealing is far from a victimless crime and costs retailers a projected $2 billion annually. SEND LETTERS TO: letters@suntimes.com. Please include your neighborhood or hometown and a phone number for verification purposes. Proponents argue that stealing from stores is based on need. But 80 percent of thieves have the money to pay for the item(s) they were attempting to steal, which frequently include high end vacuum cleaners, GPS devises, and liquor. These commonly stolen items show retail theft is more correctly labeled as a crime of opportunity, and is one that enables organized shoplifting groups, which are often part of larger criminal organizations. According to the FBI, retail theft has increased 17 percent over the last five years and the value of items stolen has increased by 30 percent. Additionally, the state has lost out on $100 million in sales tax revenue due to retail theft and municipalities have lost out on $25 million. An increase to the threshold would only make matters worse and also force municipalities to reallocate resources away from important programs in order to combat increased retail theft. Allowing thieves to steal more by increasing the felony threshold will bring about many losers. There is only one group that would win  — thieves who would receive the green light to steal more. Rob Karr, president and CEO, Illinois Retail Merchants Association War on coal miners Little do Donald Trump supporters realize that his “ending the war on coal” is the “beginning of the war on coal miners.” Most coal industry regulation are safety regulations to protect the miners. Sure, if you remove those pesky regulations the miners may make more money. But then they’ll have to spend that extra money going back to buying bird cages and canaries to check for gas and for treatments for black lung disease. Ask elderly and retired coal miners what working conditions were like before these regulations were put in place. If you can find any still alive. Jim Tomczyk, Forest Glen Rauner’s blame strategy Et tu, Phil Kadner? After reading your opinion in the April 2nd edition of the Sun-Times, I am shocked that you would fall for Gov. Bruce Rauner’s shift the blame strategy. The state of Illinois is definitely worse off since Rauner was elected governor. His break-the-state campaign has affected the most vulnerable in our society. Please explain to me how running the state like a business involves not having a budget and not paying the state’s bills. David Berkey, Elgin Prophetic statement Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. (AP Photo) Fifty years ago as of Tuesday, Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. broke with the civil rights leadership and condemned the war in Vietnam in one of the most prophetic statements in American history. He began, “A time comes when silence is betrayal, and that moment has come for me.” He knew the consequences. The next day some 200 editorials across the country “screamed their displeasure” in the words of the event’s organizer, Rev. Richard Fernandez. King saw that this war leading our nation to “spiritual death.” It is a shockingly relevant statement today with transparent parallels. While he saw the Poverty Program “broken and eviscerated” by money diverted to war-making, we see today that $2 trillion spent in our wars in Afghanistan and Iraq in the last 15 years would have rebuilt our roads and bridges AND restored quality to our schools AND paid for health care for all of our people AND reduced taxes AND restored our space program AND fed the hungry AND more! When King pleaded for ending violence on our streets, the crowds yelled out, “what about Vietnam,” and he knew he could “never again raise my voice against the violence of the oppressed in the ghettos” without confronting the violence of our own country in Vietnam. How can we deal with exploding gun violence in this metropolis by the lake when our youth see American drones and bombs and bloodshed across the Middle East? Finally, King spoke for the victims on all sides of the conflict, especially our own poor and minorities. “We were taking the black young men who had been crippled by our society and sending them 8,000 miles away to guarantee liberties in Southeast Asia which our young men had not found in Southwest Georgia and East Harlem.” Today we are producing an enormous number of crippled veterans, with serious wounds and mental disorders and alarming rates of drug use, broken families, suicide. Not to mention the tens of thousands of innocent women and children and aged and men across the Middle East and in Africa. Dr. King spoke for a “revolution of values” in which our loyalties are not to a nation, or America first, but to the global family, a world-wide fellowship of sisters and brothers, the “beloved community.” He would have opposed walls and bans and insisted on welcoming all people. His vision is a helpful counterweight to the fear and misinformation and bigotry that seems to be leading the way today. King offers us another way. To paraphrase him, “The long arc of history bends toward justice and peace for all. So may it be. Rev. Martin Deppe, Ravenswood Manor Salvo against free internet President Donald Trump is expected to sign legislation recently passed by Congress that changes the rules for internet privacy. This new legislation will allow internet service providers to amass and to sell information about an individual’s search and viewing habits. There is also a fear that the FBI will now have unfettered power to search every American’s internet trail. Apple recently fought vehemently against giving up the codes protecting their customers’ iPhones against outside intrusion, even in the event of a threat to public safety. I recently got an email from my internet security company. I already pay to have protection for my internet. Now I am going to have to pay more if I want to protect my privacy from corporate greed. I now see the motive behind the Republicans and their assault on internet privacy. Their corporate sponsors want to sell us even more services meant to protect the privacy that was legislated before, for free. This is, I fear, just the first salvo in the war against a free internet. Karen Wagner, Rolling Meadows Tweets by @csteditorials # retail theft Gov.

Both offer instant streaming movies, but Netflix requires a membership while VUDU is more of on-demand service. Both have loads of titles and releases, but which one is best for you? Read on to find out! Background Netflix has become the No. 1 provider of on-demand Internet streaming media and DVD-by-mail rental programs. Membership for Netflix includes either a DVD-by-mail rental program or unlimited streaming, with the option to have both for a higher membership fee. VUDU only provides an Internet streaming media option that features on-demand service so you only pay for what you watch, making it a video-on-demand program. User Friendly Netflix members will find that it’s quite easy to rent DVDs by mail or watch streaming movies, TV shows and more. Once you sign up online, whenever you want a movie, you go online and search for the movie title/show name and begin watching (that is if you have streaming membership). Those who have only DVD rentals choose their “wish list” and then get movies mailed to them. With no due dates, users can keep movies as long as they want before returning and starting all over again with their next desired movie. With VUDU, you get to stream directly to your VUDU-friendly device any time you’d like to watch movies. Just connect your HDTV, Blu-ray player, computer, or PlayStation 3/Xbox360 to the Internet and select VUDU as an option. Sign up for a free account and then browse through their selection of titles and then watch. You only pay per movie since it’s on-demand based. Winner: Tie since both are fairly easy to use. All you need is the Internet and you’re on your way to movie enjoyment! Compatible Devices Netflix offers quite a wide variety of compatible devices users can choose from. Its streaming service is available on devices, including: Xbox 360, PS3, Wii, iOS devices, some Android-based phones and tablets, the Windows phone, a few Internet-connected Blu-ray players and even some Internet-connected HTDTVs, TiVo or Roku, D-Link, home theater systems form the likes of Panasonic, LG, Sony, Samsung and Insignia. A great perk is that you can easily connect multiple devices to one account and then jump from device to device, while still leaving off at the same point you did on the last device. VUDU also has a bunch of devices where its services will work, such as PS3, Xbox 360 (it requires an Xbox LIVE Gold Membership, though), computers (PS and MAC) and even Apple’s iPad.  VUDU also asserts that it’s “available on virtually every Internet-connected Blu-ray player and HDTV on the market.” Winner: Netflix, obviously, offer more compatible devices so it’s a no brainer here! Titles Everybody knows that Netflix has quite the assortment of titles in its service. With more than 100,000 movies and TV shows on DVD and Blu-ray (even unrated and NC-17 ones) and “tens of thousands” of titles available for streaming (both TV and movies, along with many HD options), users can find old favorites and discover new ones.  VUDU users have access to 20,000 titles (and growing), including titles the same day they hit DVD. VUDU also claims it has the “most HD titles on demand” with more being added weekly. Their biggest claim to fame against Netflix is that they offer titles faster than Netflix would, stating that it takes Netflix 28 days later to have a new release on DVD and up to seven years for it to hit its streaming service. Winner: VUDU wins here since it offers new releases a lot faster than Netflix. Membership Perks VUDU was bought by Walmart back in July and this provided a huge step for the company as it launched VUDU streaming directly on Walmart.com for instant viewing. VUDU also offers a $5 credit for newcomers and offers HDX quality that makes viewing just like it is in the movie theater, featuring 1080p True Digital video and rich Dolby Digital Plus 7.1 surround sound. Users can now also use the website of America’s largest retailer as yet another outlet. Netflix allows for a month’s free trial so that new users can test out the service. Winner: Since Netflix offers unlimited streaming along with DVD rentals, there is a bit more bang for buck, and wins here. Content Netflix’s ability to land some big deals with movie companies has afforded them a wide assortment of content, from TV shows to movies. Since they’ve landed some pretty good content deals, users will find a great selection of TV shows from the likes of CBS, ABC, FOX, NBC and BBC libraries. Deals with Sony, NBC Universal and DreamWorks Animation (which is exclusive, but doesn’t start until 2013) also provide a large variety of content. But VUDU also scored some major content deals, too! They’ve been able to establish content licensing contracts with all major movie studios, as well as more than 50 smaller and indie studios, and that means a large library that might not be as large as Netflix, but is definitely on its way there. Winner: Netflix steals it here by having a wide assortment of TV shows and older movies that can’t be so easily found nowadays. Speed of Service VUDU’s minimum speed requirements for its services is: 480p: 1 Mbps for SD; 720p: 2.25 Mbs for HD; and 1080p: 4.5 Mbps for HDX. Netflix recommends that its users have a minimum speed of 500 kbps (0.5 MB) to get maximum results for its service. Winner: Tie Quality VUDU offers movies in HDX, which delivers the highest quality true High Definition 1080p content available from any Internet, broadcast or satellite on-demand service. It also provides rich Dolby Digital Plus 7.1 surround sound and offers many HD titles. Netflix also has HD movies and is capable of streaming 1080p video. Winner: VUDU’s had the edge with its HDX and 7.1-channel surround. Limitations Netflix users saw a price hike for using both streaming and DVD-by-mail rentals, which many might consider a limitation. Since VUDU’s services are on a per-movie basis, you can easily rack up a high tab if you go movie crazy. Winner: Netflix has less limitations for the money; they just offer more. Price Netflix charges $7.99 for unlimited streaming movies OR unlimited one-disc at a time rental service ($11.99 for 2 unlimited). For those that want both, they’ll have to dish out $15.98 a month. Netflix also offers Blu-ray discs for an additional $2 a month. Unlike Netflix, VUDU is s available without a monthly subscription or contract with some movies available to rent for just $2 for 2 nights. But some movies can cost up to $5 a pop (HDX is the most expensive option, but usually it’s SD for $3.99 and HD for $4.99). You can also opt to purchase the video and this various per movie. Winner: Netflix’s monthly charge doesn’t look so bad compared to VUDU’s per-movie charge. Overall Winner Netflix wins! VUDU might be quickly crouching on Netflix’s tail, but it still hasn’t overtaken the popular movie rental service. Its low monthly fee and numerous titles proves it can’t be beat!

Were you able to check with your ISP and make sure they’re not throttling you? I only ask, because some ISPs have data limits. Reply SwampGator89 on Vudu sucks. I will never use Vudu again and recommend that nobody does. I actually purchased several movies from Vudu and the buffering throughout one movie was so bad, I couldn’t watch it (but had no problems with Fantango, Apple TV, Hulu, Netflix). I tried contacting Vudu to get a refund but Vudu makes it impossible to get in tough with it for any reason. So I challenged the charge through my credit card company who got no response from Vudu as well (Vudu was given every opportunity to respond, but just ignored it). So my credit card company refunded me the charge for the 1 movie purchased that I couldn’t watch, and Vudu responded by suspending my account so I can’t watch any of the 8 other movies purchased from Vudu. It’s fraud and I’ll be taking the appropriate action against Vudu. Reply Lee on I will never ever again use VUDU…I signed up with VUDU last year and received a coupon code. I then used it to watch a movie. With in less than a minute I realized that I’ve already seen the movie so I then immediately turned it off and called VUDU to see if there was anything that can be done since I didn’t watch the movie. I was advised that they would give me the credit back to my acct. since I didn’t watch the movie. I was very pleased to hear this. I really don’t use VUDU often so a couple of months later I ordered a show from VUDU expecting it to use my code, instead it used my PayPal acct. I called VUDU, spoke to the rudest supervisor who basically called me a liar. Not only did she say that I never received a credit but also told me that I never ordered the movie from them. I will never again use VUDU & I will advise everyone against using them as well. Reply shadoe on The most stupid article I’ve ever read. Vudu wins always cause they have tons of new releases and lots of more movie and TV availability. If you buy something on vudu, its yours to keep. Where on Netflix, you can’t do that. matter fact Netflix be removing TV shows and movies and vudu doesn’t. Netflix is for broke people who don’t wanna pay for movies, so they just watch whatever’s available. you could connect vudu with amazon and Disney anywhere. You can’t do that with Netflix. Who ever wrote this article must be a Netflix fan boy.. Never compare vudu with Netflix. go do some more research before writing a article. Reply Dennis on Actually, Vudu loses hands down. For less than the price of two streamed movies in HD from Vudu, I can have a new DVD everyday from Netflix for a month. Thirty vs two. Duh. Reply Venod on *****BEWARE the RENT IS ONLY JUST 24 HRS. My Money so wasted I purchased 2 days before I could watch. ***** Reply Jpnh on I’m surprised no one has gone more into availability of content. Netflix will add or drop shows seemingly on a whim. If I see something available, I always want it available. That’s where I like Vudu, where once I buy content I can feel confident that I will always have access to it. Reply SortingHat on Wow! I guess it’s not autism that makes me not like unknowns. I was always wondering the differences and I guess that wins it for me having Vudu be more stable then Netflix on what it offers even though you pay as you go which is good if you only watch movies once in a while. Reply Eruc on I’d be curious to know how these services stack up against each other today, two years after this comparison was made. Anyone know or willing to put it to the test? Reply Bobsk8 on Vudu, you need 2.25 MBS for HD, I don’t get that on my DSL. I have no problem watching HD on Netflix. Reply Conor James on I think Vudu actually should win the compadiable devices catagory, since you can download the movies you bought to devices such as the ipad, allowing you to watch your movie without an internet connection. Reply Stephen Riss on You are drop dead goregous!!! Reply Bridget on Netflix is good for the day to day movie/tv watching. I dont have cable and use a combination of Netflix/ HuluPlus/ Network TV. When I want to rent a movie I use Vudu/ Amazon depending on who has the cheapest rental fee. Vudu is JUST another option for having a cable like experience without the cable like price. VERY budget friendly and you can watch the movie as many times as you want in a time period. Reply SortingHat on We used to use Amazon but recently their player has screwed up and now want to charge 100$ a year after a few times of watching it. But that aside their player is one to be desired. If you like to rewind movies you can only do it 2 times or it will freeze up requiring the *player* to be shut down in a control alt del way and forced to turn on the movie all over again and have to find where you left off. If you like captioning it will say *On* and their onboard captions do not work. :( I like captioning as I don’t keep up with fast paced movies very well. Reply Vudu Convert on I was a long time netflix user. The availability of new titles is what killed it for me. I just signed up for Vudu today. I like how they will offer newer titles way faster than netflix. If people are honest they will agree netflix has way more movies but the majority of them are ones you wouldn’t watch anyway. You will find yourself wanting to watch recent releases while netflix shugs their shoulders LOL! Reply sledge hammer on my xbox live ran out today,and yet my vudu is on thru the xbox right now.netflix wont even let you in to browse without the xbox live.although it may be cuz i have digital copies and movies i already own in the vudu service. Reply Johnny on Very nice summation. Thanks Kristie Johnny A Reply johnny on Very nice summation – Thanks Kristie Johnny A Reply Tango on minor problem with netflix, they usually only have season one maybe season two of a show and the rest of the seasons are never available. I have to watch them on Hulu plus. Reply Big Michael Kank on Really nice review, i learned alot of it, thank you. Reply My4prnsses on Why pay for each rental individually with Vudu, unless you RARELY use it.  For those of us who are tired of the cable and satellite prices, Netflix is the answer.  If I want to watch network shows, they are available to watch for free.  The only reason I ever use Vudu is if I want to watch a new release because it is cheap-unless I rent from Redbox for $1.29. Reply shadoe on You sound broke Reply mike kahk on U type like a n1993r. Reply Biggmike40 on Kristie is gorgeous Reply Bluesaltyocean99 on who wants to pay per movie on Vudu…I have been a member of Netflix since it started, I have the cheapest plan…less than $16.00 a month for unlimited streaming movies…I think it is the better deal… Reply Gadget Gator on Depends on if you want better quality or not. The VUDU videos are amazingly good and start up instantly. They have a growing selection of 3d titles as well which look great. Also for someone that only watches a movie once in awhile, the VUDU option would be more cost effective. It just depends on how much content you consume and what quality you want it. Reply Angelina Stevens on Vudu will be bought by Google in the near future. That’s been predicted and it’ll be better. Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

So far, though, many brands are still playing hard to get. A spokesperson for Google said Monday it will begin working with “trusted” third-party firms to better identify offensive YouTube content that brands may not want to place ads next to. Google also said it is now relying on artificial intelligence to pinpoint content that could be objectionable to advertisers. An investigation published last month by The Times in London revealed that ads from companies like the BBC and L’Oreal were placed near content on YouTube posted by religious extremists, a Ku Klux Klan leader and more. That finding prompted an advertiser exodus in the UK and US. AT&T, Verizon, Walmart, Johnson & Johnson, JPMorgan Chase and others all confirmed suspending ads on YouTube.

(AT&T has agreed to acquire Time Warner, the parent company of CNN. The deal is pending regulatory approval.) Other brands, including Coca Cola, Walmart, Starbucks and Chase, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Only Johnson & Johnson confirmed changing its mind — in select markets. “Johnson & Johnson has resumed YouTube digital advertising in a number of select countries following the implementation of increased brand protection measures by Google,” Carol Goodrich, a spokeswoman for Johnson & Johnson, said in a statement.

The company has submitted its large-scale development proposal to city planners, and it is scheduled to be considered at the planning commission meeting April 18. Walmart has not announced plans for the new facility, and did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday (April 3). According to the development plan filed with the city — called Project Maple — Walmart is proposing a building totaling 1.27 million square feet, to be built on 120 acres at 5800 S.W. Regional Airport Blvd. The site is across the highway from the existing 1.2 million-square-foot Walmart Distribution Center 6094 at 5801 S.W. Regional Airport Blvd. It opened approximately 20 years ago. The new building will include 1.03 million square feet of warehouse space, 216,000 square feet dedicated to shipping operations, and 16,307 square feet of office space. The filing also indicates an additional 299,000 square feet for a warehouse expansion in the future. The land is owned by Ft Scott Property LLC, a Delaware-registered entity that paid $2.63 million for the acreage in February 2013. The Ronald and Sherry Rominger Revocable Trust was the seller. It was rezoned by city planners in February 2015 from A-1, Agricultural to I-1, Light Industrial. It’s unclear what the facility’s primary purpose will be. Beau Thompson, a senior planner for the city of Bentonville, said he did not have any specific operational information related to the development. A facility that supports Walmart’s rapidly growing e-commerce business would seem logical. Such a center would help Walmart better compete with Amazon when it comes to online order fulfillment. Growing e-commerce sales in the U.S. is a top priority for the retailer, and the company has spent more than $2 billion on its e-commerce infrastructure in the past two years. “We’re rapidly enhancing our fulfillment capabilities to give customers more choices and fast shipping, while keeping our costs down so we can continue to lower our prices,” said Neil Ashe, former CEO of Walmart Global eCommerce, when the company opened a new e-commerce fulfillment center in Atlanta in October 2015. “Whether shipping to home or picking up at a store, our digital and physical fulfillment assets come together and let customers choose the most convenient way to receive their online orders.” The centers are part of what Walmart calls its next-generation fulfillment network—Walmart  distribution centers, existing e-commerce facilities, 4,500 Walmart stores and a world-class transportation fleet — that ships packages faster and more efficiently, while offering customers more choices for how they receive online orders.

Subscribe to our newsletter. Mark Malloch Brown US President Donald Trump, who once called climate change a Chinese hoax intended to weaken the US economy, has repealed the Stream Protection Rule which bars coal producers from dumping waste into waterways. Photo: Reuters The relationship between business, politics and the environment is about to become more complicated. As US President Donald Trump’s administration threatens to dismantle vital environmental protections, some of which have existed for decades, business leaders are increasingly recognizing—and acting upon—the need for environmentally sustainable policies. Trump, who once called climate change a Chinese hoax intended to weaken the US economy, has repealed the Stream Protection Rule which bars coal producers from dumping waste into waterways. Next on the chopping block may be the Clean Power Plan, which limits greenhouse-gas emissions from generating plants—by far the country’s largest source of carbon dioxide emissions—with the goal of cutting carbon pollution from the power sector to 32% below 2005 levels by 2030. The Trump administration has even threatened to back out of the Paris agreement. A decade ago, business leaders would have largely welcomed such regressive environmental policies, which can lower costs and expand opportunities. But today, even as markets respond bullishly to Trump’s “business-friendly” pledges— not just deregulation and tax cuts, but also a trillion-dollar infrastructure plan that would include reviving coal—business leaders have remained cautious. In particular, they have strong reservations about a potential withdrawal from the Paris agreement. Whatever benefits could be derived from a low-regulation economy would not offset the harm of reneging on environmental commitments that are viewed as vital to American business success. Some are already making their voices heard on the matter. Since Trump’s election, nearly 900 companies and investors, many of them American, have signed an open letter, “Business Backs Low Carbon”, calling on the administration not to withdraw the US from the Paris agreement. These companies, which include large multinationals, believe that failure to build a low-carbon economy would jeopardize America’s prosperity. There is compelling recent research to support this view. Last January, the Business & Sustainable Development Commission, which I chair, estimated that companies could unlock $12 trillion globally in revenue and savings by pursuing sustainable business models. Such models can also create up to 380 million jobs by 2030 in key economic sectors, including food and agriculture, energy, transport, health, and municipal government. In the energy sector alone, the opportunities are valued at $4.3 trillion. Corporate strategies are increasingly falling into line with these findings. In 2005, on the heels of Hurricane Katrina, which devastated the US Gulf Coast and affected a significant regional consumer base for Walmart, the company’s then chief executive officer (CEO), Lee Scott, delivered a telling speech, titled “Twenty-First Century Leadership”, to all company employees. Scott set significant environmental goals, as part of a broader vision for Walmart to become a more responsible corporate citizen. Today, Walmart is a leading commercial solar and on-site renewable-energy user, deriving about 25% of its global energy consumption from renewable sources. By increasing the efficiency of its US fleet of trucks, Walmart avoided the emission of nearly 650,000 metric tonnes of carbon dioxide from 2005 to 2015, and saved nearly $1 billion in 2016 alone. Another US company, Mars, Inc., is on a similar path. A signatory of the Business Backs Low Carbon letter, Mars is working to eliminate its greenhouse-gas emissions entirely by 2040, through greater efficiency and investment in renewable energy projects like wind turbines. The company’s CEO, Grant Reid, is also a member of the Business & Sustainable Development Commission. But while business leadership and collective action are needed to create a sustainable and inclusive economy, the private sector cannot do it alone. Government must be an active partner, helping to scale sustainable activities by creating market conditions that spur a “race to the top” and unlock the finance needed to keep America competitive and innovative. So it is not enough simply to oppose Trump’s environmentally damaging policies; businesses need to get his administration on their side, so that the US authorities create an environment that encourages sustainable practices and green innovation. Such an environment could include carbon pricing, which a growing number of businesses are pursuing internally, and tax credits for carbon efficiency. Trump’s own businesses have benefited from such government interventions. As The New York Times revealed, in 2012, Trump secured nearly $1 million in energy-efficiency incentives and low-interest loans from New York State. A groundswell of support from CEOs, on a non-partisan basis, could be the key to spurring the needed action. Before the Paris climate conference, politicians knew that environmental activists wanted a deal to limit climate change; arguably, what ultimately drove them to act, however, was finding out that CEOs and boards felt the same way. Business leaders need to show Trump that they are not cheerleaders for coal, pollution, and global warming. They are determined champions of an enlightened environmentalism that is in the interest of all their stakeholders—customers, shareholders, employees, and the communities in which they operate. ©2017/Project Syndicate Mark Malloch Brown is chair of the Business and Sustainable Development Commission and a former UN deputy secretary general and UK Foreign Office minister of state for Africa.

Josh Derickson Facebook i By Lisa Gutierrez lgutierrez@kcstar.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Levi Zimmerman doesn’t seem to get the viral fuss over what he did for an elderly couple at Wal-Mart last week. But Josh Derickson witnessed Levi’s kindness and wrote about it on Facebook, where now hundreds of others are praising the South Dakota high school student. It happened at the Wal-Mart in Yankton, S.D. where Levi works part-time. “Just witnessed this young man working at Walmart help pay for a elderly couples groceries because they didn't have enough money,” Derickson wrote on his Facebook page on March 29. “I was minding my own business and didn't even realize what was going on until he had his wallet out and using his debit card!! I’m still shocked. “I didnt now what to say to him as he checked me out. I paid for my stuff and I think I ended up saying thank you that was very nice!!” People who read Derickson’s post were equally impressed by Levi. Some who knows him wrote that this isn’t the first time Levi has plunked down his own money to help a customer.       Levi told KCAU in Sioux City, Iowa his parents “have always said it's just what your suppose to do, you know. If someone is just in that small of a pickle, might as well. “Kind of live life just by (helping) other people and I just believe in common human decency.” Related content LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story National Suggested for you Comments Videos facebook twitter email Share More Videos 1:17 Westminster Dog Show features new breeds Pause 2:31 Canines frolic in an indoor dog park 24:17 The GO bond debate: Listen to arguments for and against the ballot measure 2:01 Human bones found in Cass County 2:20 Grandma of KCK boy fed to pigs recites a message she wrote to her grandson 20:45 Crown Chasers: After long journey to the top, can the Royals reign again in 2017? 1:32 Royals pitcher and weather watcher Danny Duffy 2:05 KU's Frank Mason is NABC player of year 0:27 A few warmup dunks by Michael Porter Jr. at McDonald's All-American Game 12:27 Surveillance video shows robbery that led to Independence officer shooting Share Video Video link: Select Embed code: Select facebook twitter email 14 hours ago Surveillance shows woman trying to stop vehicle theft by spraying man with gasoline 0:36 14 hours ago Surveillance shows woman trying to stop vehicle theft by spraying man with gasoline 0:22 13 hours ago California Highway Patrol seeking car surfing daredevil after dangerous highway stunt 4:29 7 days ago North Carolina doctor raps about a major public health concern that 'never gets old' View more video National Sessions orders Justice Department to review all police reform agreements Bill O'Reilly, ex-Fox chief hit with more sexual allegations Fights over Supreme Court nominees are nothing new Trump signs bill blocking online privacy regulation Trump says US will forge a 'great bond' with Egypt Nation & World Videos Subscriptions Digital Subscriptions Home Delivery E-Star Site Information Customer Service About Us Contact Us Newspapers in Education Social, Mobile & More Facebook Twitter Mobile apps and E-Star Mobile Alerts Newsletters Advertising Advertising information Print Digital Place a Classified Local Deals Shopping Copyright Commenting Policy Privacy Policy Terms of Service Subscriptions Digital Subscriptions Home Delivery E-Star Site Information Customer Service About Us Contact Us Newspapers in Education Social, Mobile & More Facebook Twitter Mobile apps and E-Star Mobile Alerts Newsletters Advertising Advertising information Print Digital Place a Classified Local Deals Shopping More Copyright Commenting Policy Privacy Policy Terms of Service

An air-conditioning unit on the roof had burned up and caused “a light haze of smoke,” Fire Department Lt. Terry Lewis said. Store employees had reported seeing “a light smoke or soot” coming from the roof Monday morning, Fire Chief Tim Hendrix said. Firefighters used thermal-imaging equipment to check for a fire inside the building but didn’t see signs of a fire. The burned-up AC unit had sent smoke into the building, starting in an office, and out of the roof, Lewis said. The store stayed closed while firefighters determined the cause and disconnected the affected unit. Lewis said firefighters used gas-powered fans to clear smoke out of the store.

But that narrative doesn’t exactly mesh with what was said at an all-hands meeting just a few months ago, when Amazon and Quidsi executives told employees that they were confident that Quidsi would indeed be profitable in 2017, several sources in attendance told Recode. At the meeting in late 2016, executives said Quidsi would also generate significant free cash flow in 2017, which is notable because Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos has long said that he cares more about free cash flow than he does profit margins or profitability metrics such as operating income and net income. The turn of events has left many of Quidsi’s 263 employees stunned and has led to much speculation about alternative reasons for Amazon’s decision. One popular theory is that Amazon doesn’t want to admit that a business it paid $545 million to acquire in 2011 was never really a strategic fit, since it meant sending customers to sites other than Amazon.com for popular consumer packaged goods items. This key category is the current battleground for a pricing war between Amazon and Walmart that is terrifying big-name brands. Others believe a more unusual reason, claiming it could be some gamesmanship on the part of Bezos intended to send a message to Wall Street, as well as Walmart leadership, that Quidsi co-founder Marc Lore cannot build profitable businesses. Lore is currently the e-commerce chief in the U.S. for Walmart, which paid $3 billion to buy the startup, Jet.com, that he created after leaving Amazon. Amazon declined to comment further beyond its initial statement when it made the surprise announcement about Quidsi last week. At the time, its spokeswoman released a statement: “We have worked extremely hard for the past seven years to get Quidsi to be profitable, and unfortunately we have not been able to do so. Quidsi has great brand expertise and they will continue to offer selections on Amazon.com; the software development team will focus on building technology for AmazonFresh.” Putting aside the fact that Amazon has only owned the business for six years, not seven, the statement is otherwise true. Using generally accepted accounting principles, Quidsi has never generated net income for a full fiscal year since Amazon acquired the company six years ago, sources say. Quidsi has, however, strung together profitable months over the last two years, sources familiar with the matter told Recode. As far back as 2015, in fact, the company had a party when it turned a monthly profit for the first time. Quidsi has also shaved tens of millions of dollars in losses off of the business over the past few years, while the statement Amazon made seems to imply little progress. What’s more, many costs that Amazon is currently allocating to the Quidsi business won’t disappear when Quidsi shuts down, sources contend. That’s because they stem from business functions at Amazon that support the entire retail operation and would be costs for Amazon whether or not Quidsi is in existence. In short, several sources believe Amazon will save little money — by the company’s standards — by shutting down the business. Add to all of this the positive comments from execs at the late 2016 all-hands meeting, and you can understand why Quidsi employees are confused by Amazon’s explanation for the decision. “You don’t just shut down a business of this size that’s going to be profitable and moving in the right reaction,” said one. Said another: “It’s just baffling.” If you have more information about these changes, contact me at jason@recode.net or at 917 655 4267 on messaging services including Signal, Confide and WhatsApp. Subscribe to the Recode newsletter Sign up for our Recode Daily newsletter to get the top tech and business news stories delivered to your inbox.

The department shared images that appear to match the description of the teen and her alleged abductor, 50-year-old Tad Cummins, at a McDonald’s in Kearney, Nebraska, more than 900 miles west from of their home state of Tennessee. The sighting has not been confirmed by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation. The TBI last released surveillance images of the two at a Walmart in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma on Friday. The footage was taken on March 15, two days after the teen was allegedly abducted. The footage, which was the first confirmed sighting of the two since they went missing last month, made the Thomas family more hopeful for her safe return, according to her father, Anthony Thomas, who spoke with ABC News on Friday. MEDIA: Here's a quick video clip of Tad Cummins & Elizabeth Thomas entering the Walmart in Oklahoma City on 3/15.https://t.co/tIsI94rT6a — TBI (@TBInvestigation) March 31, 2017 The possible sighting came as more than 100 people gathered in Thomas’ hometown of Columbia, Tennessee, for a candlelight vigil on Sunday. The event’s organizers said it wasn’t about mourning, but about praying and pleading for her safe return, according to ABC affiliate WKRN. “We need you home because we love you and the house is empty and quiet without you. You were the one that made everybody happy and loved. You made the house really loved,” Elizabeth Thomas’s sister Ninita Thomas said to the crowd. Elizabeth’s father also spoke at the event. “Without her, the house is just too quiet. Please understand that she is not better off out there, she is better off here this community of people who care about her all of us,” her father said. “This community that knows and love her.” An Amber Alert has been issued for Thomas and Cummins is wanted on allegations of aggravated kidnapping and sexual contact with a minor. The former teacher has been added to Tennessee’s ten most wanted list. Cummins was fired from the Culleoka Unit School, where Elizabeth had been a student in his forensics class, shortly after the two vanished. Cummins’ wife, Jill Cummins, filed for divorce on Friday, citing irreconcilable differences. She also alleged that her husband was “guilty of inappropriate marital conduct.” Jill Cummins had previously begged her husband to come home and “do the right thing” while speaking at a TBI new conference in March, according to WRKN. “This is not who you are. We can help you get through this,” Jill Cummins said. “No matter how far you’ve gone or what’s happening right now, God’s grace is sufficient for you, and He wants you to come home.” Copyright © 2017, ABC Radio.

By Daisuke Wakabayashi New York Times  April 03, 2017 MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. — Over the years, Google trained computer systems to keep copyrighted content and pornography off its YouTube service. But after seeing ads from Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble, and Walmart appear next to racist, anti-Semitic, or terrorist videos, its engineers realized their computer models had a blind spot: They did not understand context. Now teaching computers to understand what humans can readily grasp may be the key to calming fears among big-spending advertisers that their ads have been appearing alongside videos from extremist groups and other offensive messages. Advertisement Google engineers, product managers, and policy wonks are trying to train computers to grasp the nuances of what makes certain videos objectionable. Advertisers may tolerate use of a racial epithet in a hip-hop video, for example, but may be horrified to see it used in a video from a racist skinhead group. That ads bought by well-known companies can occasionally appear next to offensive videos has long been considered a nuisance to YouTube’s business. But the issue has gained urgency in recent weeks, as The Times of London and other outlets have written about brands that inadvertently fund extremists through automated advertising — a byproduct of a system in which YouTube shares a portion of ad sales with the creators of the content those ads appear against. Get Talking Points in your inbox: An afternoon recap of the day’s most important business news, delivered weekdays. Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here This glitch in the company’s giant, automated process turned into a public-relations nightmare. Companies like AT&T and Johnson & Johnson said they would pull their ads from YouTube, as well as Google’s display advertising business, until they could get assurances that such placement would not happen again. Consumers watch more than a billion hours on YouTube every day, making it the dominant video platform on the Internet and an obvious beneficiary as advertising money moves online from television. But the recent problems opened Google to criticism that it was not doing enough to look out for advertisers. It is a significant problem for a multibillion-dollar company that still gets most of its revenue through advertising. “We take this as seriously as we’ve ever taken a problem,” Philipp Schindler, Google’s chief business officer, said in an interview last week. “We’ve been in emergency mode.” Advertisement During the last two weeks, Google has changed what types of videos can carry advertising, barring ads from appearing with hate speech or discriminatory content. In addition, Google is simplifying how advertisers can exclude specific sites, channels, and videos across YouTube and Google’s display network. It is allowing brands to fine-tune the types of content they want to avoid, such as “sexually suggestive” or “sensational/bizarre” videos. It is also putting in more stringent safety standards by default, so an advertiser must choose to place ads next to more provocative content. Google created an expedited way to alert it when ads appear next to offensive content. The Silicon Valley giant is trying to reassure companies like Unilever, the world’s second-largest advertiser, with a portfolio of consumer brands like Dove and Ben & Jerry’s. As other brands started fleeing YouTube, Unilever discovered three instances in which its brands appeared on objectionable YouTube channels. But Keith Weed, chief marketing officer of Unilever, decided not to withdraw its ads because the number of ads appearing with objectionable content was proportionally small. The average $100,000 YouTube campaign runs across more than 7,000 channels, according to the video analytics firm OpenSlate, and Unilever spends hundreds of millions of dollars on YouTube. Also, Google discovered that the ads in question appeared because of a human error in setting safety levels. Weed said it was in Unilever’s best interest to win concessions from Google instead of cutting ties. As part of its new measures, Google agreed to work with outside companies to provide third-party verification about where ads appeared on YouTube. When he broached the idea of independent verification in the past, Weed said, Google executives acted as though he had suggested the company was not trustworthy. He said the issue was not about trust, but about companies being able to “mark their own homework.” ‘No system can be 100 percent perfect. We’re working as hard as we can to make it as safe as possible.’ He said he thought that Google would have agreed eventually, but that “the current situation accelerated their plans.” Google’s efforts are being noticed. Johnson & Johnson, for example, said it had resumed YouTube advertising in a number of countries. Google said other companies were starting to return. For the most part, Google failed to address the issue adequately before because it did not have to; the instances in which ads appeared next to objectionable content happened infrequently and out of view from the broader public. Google said that for many of its top advertisers, the objectionable videos accounted for fewer than one one-thousandth of a percent of their total ad impressions. To train the computers, Google is applying machine-learning techniques — the underlying technology for many of its biggest breakthroughs, like the self-driving car. It has also brought in large human teams (it declined to say how big) to review the appropriateness of videos that computers flagged as questionable. Essentially, they are training computers to recognize footage of a woman in a sports bra and leggings doing yoga poses in an exercise video as safe for advertising and not sexually suggestive content. Similarly, they will mark video of a Hollywood action star waving a gun as acceptable to some advertisers, while flagging a similar image involving an Islamic State gunman as inappropriate. Google used a similar approach in the past to create an automated rating system for videos, similar to movie ratings, based on appropriateness of content for specific audiences. But Google is now trying to solve a different problem. “Computers have a much harder time understanding context, and that’s why we’re actually using all of our latest and greatest machine learning abilities now to get a better feel for this,” Schindler said. Armed with human-verified examples of what is safe and what is not, Google’s computer systems break down the images of a YouTube video frame by frame, analyzing every image. They also digest what is being said, the video’s description from the creator, and other signals to detect patterns and identify subtle cues for what makes a video inappropriate. The idea is for machines to eventually make the tough calls. In the instances when brands feel that Google failed to flag an inappropriate video, that example is fed back into the system so it improves over time. Google said it had already flagged five times as many videos as inappropriate for advertising, although it declined to provide absolute numbers on how many videos that entailed. With more than a billion videos on YouTube, 400 hours of new content being uploaded every minute, and 3 million ad-supported channels on the platform, Schindler said it was impossible to guarantee that Google could eradicate the problem completely. He made a comparison to how a car company could not promise that even a new tire would never fail in the first 10,000 miles. “No system can be 100 percent perfect,” he said. “But we’re working as hard as we can to make it as safe as possible.” Loading comments...

US President Donald Trump holds up an executive order on "energy independence" during a signing ceremony at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) headquarters in Washington, DC, March 28, 2017. Image: Xinhua/REUTERS via China.org.cn By Mark Malloch Brown Monday 3 April 2017 Share this story The relationship between business, politics, and the environment is about to become more complicated. As US President Donald Trump’s administration threatens to dismantle vital environmental protections, some of which have existed for decades, business leaders are increasingly recognizing – and acting upon – the need for environmentally sustainable policies. Trump, who once called climate change a Chinese hoax intended to weaken the US economy, has already repealed the Stream Protection Rule, which bars coal producers from dumping waste into waterways. Next on the chopping block may be the Clean Power Plan, which limits greenhouse-gas emissions from generating plants – by far the country’s largest source of CO2 emissions – with the goal of cutting carbon pollution from the power sector to 32 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. The Trump administration has even threatened to back out of the Paris climate agreement, to which the world’s governments committed in 2015. A decade ago, business leaders would have largely welcomed such regressive environmental policies, which can lower costs and expand opportunities, by reducing constraints on their companies’ behavior. But today, even as markets respond bullishly to Trump’s “business-friendly” pledges – not just deregulation and tax cuts, but also a trillion-dollar infrastructure plan that would include reviving coal – business leaders have remained cautious. In particular, they have strong reservations about a potential withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement. Whatever benefits could be derived from a low-regulation economy would not offset the harm of reneging on environmental commitments that are viewed as vital to American business success. Some are already making their voices heard on the matter. Since Trump’s election, nearly 900 companies and investors, many of them American, have signed an open letter, “Business Backs Low Carbon,” calling on the administration not to withdraw the US from the Paris agreement. These companies, which include large multinationals, believe that failure to build a low-carbon economy would jeopardize America’s prosperity. There is compelling recent research to support this view. Last month, a study by Energy Innovation showed that elimination of the Clean Power Plan alone could cost the US $600 billion and cause 120,000 premature deaths by 2050. By contrast, efforts to build a more sustainable economy would bring far-reaching benefits. A December 2016 report by the Risky Business Project, led by American CEOs and former municipal and federal leaders, shows that savings in fuel costs from an 80 per cent reduction in CO2emissions by 2050 could exceed the required capital investment by $150 billion. Last January, the Business & Sustainable Development Commission, which I chair, estimated in its flagship report that companies could unlock $12 trillion globally in revenue and savings by pursuing sustainable business models. Such models can also create up to 380 million jobs by 2030 in key economic sectors, including food and agriculture, energy, transport, health, and municipal government. In the energy sector alone, the opportunities are valued at $4.3 trillion. “ Whatever benefits could be derived from a low-regulation economy would not offset the harm of reneging on environmental commitments that are viewed as vital to American business success. Corporate strategies are increasingly falling into line with these findings. In 2005, on the heels of Hurricane Katrina, which devastated the US Gulf Coast and affected a significant regional consumer base for Walmart, the company’s then-CEO Lee Scott delivered a telling speech, entitled “Twenty-First Century Leadership,” to all company employees. Scott set significant environmental goals, as part of a broader vision for Walmart to become a more responsible corporate citizen. Today, Walmart is a leading commercial solar and on-site renewable-energy user, deriving about 25 per cent of its global energy consumption from renewable sources. (The company’s goal, set by Scott, is to rely entirely on renewables.) By increasing the efficiency of its US fleet of trucks, Walmart avoided the emission of nearly 650,000 metric tons of CO2 from 2005 to 2015, and saved nearly $1 billion in 2016 alone. Another US company, Mars, Inc., is on a similar path. A signatory of the Business Backs Low Carbon letter, Mars is working to eliminate its greenhouse-gas emissions entirely by 2040, through greater efficiency and investment in renewable energy projects like wind turbines. The company’s CEO, Grant Reid, is also a member of the Business & Sustainable Development Commission. But, while business leadership and collective action are needed to create a sustainable and inclusive economy (a central message of our commission’s report), the private sector cannot do it alone. Government must be an active partner, helping to scale sustainable activities by creating market conditions that spur a “race to the top” and unlock the finance needed to keep America competitive and innovative. So it is not enough simply to oppose Trump’s environmentally damaging policies; businesses need to get his administration on their side, so that the US authorities create an environment that encourages sustainable practices and green innovation. Such an environment could include carbon pricing, which a growing number of businesses are pursuing internally, and tax credits for carbon efficiency. Trump’s own businesses have benefited from such government interventions. As the New York Times recently revealed, in 2012, Trump secured nearly $1 million in energy-efficiency incentives and low-interest loans from New York State. A groundswell of support from CEOs, on a nonpartisan basis, could be the key to spurring the needed action. Before the Paris climate conference, politicians knew that environmental activists wanted a deal to limit climate change; arguably, what ultimately drove them to act, however, was finding out that CEOs and boards felt the same way. Business leaders need to show Trump that they are not cheerleaders for coal, pollution, and global warming. They are determined champions of an enlightened environmentalism that is in the interest of all their stakeholders – customers, shareholders, employees, and the communities in which they operate.

The Verge The ethics of emulation: how creators, the community, and the law view console emulators If you follow emulation news, here's a story you've probably heard. Nintendo releases a brand new Legend of Zelda game for a young console. It is immediately heralded as one of the greatest games ever made. Reviewers give it perfect marks. It is, definitively, the best reason to own Nintendo's new hardware. And mere weeks after its release, when buzz was at its highest, a PC emulator was able to run that massively popular game... PC Gamer Inside the making of 'Mass Effect Andromeda' On Wednesday 22 February, there was a curious, disbelieving buzz in the studios of the video game developer BioWare in downtown Montreal. That morning, NASA had announced the discovery of seven Earth-sized, potentially life-harboring planets orbiting a dwarf star called Trappist-1, around 40 light years from Earth. Many at BioWare – home to the beloved Mass Effect series of sci-fi role playing games – felt that the timing was a little too good to be true. Glixel Amazon is dead serious about delivering your goodies by drone Almost four years ago, in a puffy 60 Minutes piece about Amazon, CEO Jeff Bezos gave us a peek at a secret project: autonomous “octocopters,” also known as giant drones. The flying devices, Bezos assured us, would cut out UPS and FedEx to deliver packages to Amazon’s customers. At the time, skeptics dismissed it as a publicity stunt and doubted that the company would ever pursue the seemingly nutty scheme. Backchannel Iron Man-style flight suit inventor struggles to convince anyone it is not an April Fools’ A British inventor had built an Iron Man-style flight suit, but is struggling to convince anyone it is not an April Fools’ joke. Richard Browning, a former Royal Marine Reserve, has created the machine using six miniature jet engines and a specially designed exoskeleton. But many news organisations have been getting in touch to ask if it is just an incredibly convincing hoax. The Independent Game over, Uwe Boll In a small, cold film studio in early 2016, the man known by the Internet as the “worst director in the world” was doing what he does, well, worst. “O.K., one more time,” said Uwe Boll (his first name is pronounced “OO-vah”), feeding lines to one of the actors in the absence of a script. “Straight in the lens: ‘. . . has been killed. By the law . . . er . . . the law enforcement? Has been shot by law enforcement.’ Yes. O.K., do it. Ready, and . . . Action!” Vanity Fair The $2 32-bit Arduino (with debugging) I have a bit of a love/hate relationship with the Arduino. But if I had two serious gripes about the original offering it was the 8-bit CPU and the lack of proper debugging support. Now there’s plenty of 32-bit support in the Arduino IDE, so that takes care of the first big issue. Taking care of having a real debugger, though, is a bit trickier. I recently set out to use one of the cheap “blue pill” STM32 ARM boards. Hackaday The reckoning: Why the movie business is in big trouble The uncertainty surrounding the film business and the direction it needs to take in order to survive is also being manifested in the corporate suites. Sony Pictures is struggling to find a replacement for outgoing CEO Michael Lynton, having cycled through likely candidates such as former Disney COO Tom Staggs, while considering more offbeat options like former Hulu head Jason Kilar. Variety Why I always tug on the ATM Once you understand how easy and common it is for thieves to attach “skimming” devices to ATMs and other machines that accept debit and credit cards, it’s difficult not to closely inspect and even tug on the machines before using them. Several readers who are in the habit of doing just that recently shared images of skimmers they discovered after gently pulling on various parts of a cash machine they were about to use. Krebs on Security Reverse engineering malware 101: Section 1 - Fundamentals In this section you will be setting up a safe virtual malware analysis environment. The virtual machine (VM) that you will be running the malware on should not have internet access nor network share access to the host system. This VM will be designated as the Victim VM. On the other hand, the Sniffer VM will have a passive role in serving and monitoring the internet traffic of the Victim VM. This connection remains on a closed network within virtualbox. Secured.org Security update for the LastPass extension On Saturday, March 25th, security researcher Tavis Ormandy from Google’s Project Zero reported a security finding related to the LastPass browser extensions. In the last 24 hours, we’ve released an update which we believe fixes the reported vulnerability in all browsers and have verified this with Tavis himself. Most users will be updated automatically. Please ensure you are running the latest version (4.1.44 or higher), which can always be downloaded at https://www.lastpass.com/. LastPass Amazon and Walmart are in an all-out price war that is terrifying America’s biggest brands Last month, Walmart gathered some of America’s biggest household brands near its Arkansas headquarters for a tough talk. For years, Walmart had dominated the retail landscape on the back of its “Everyday Low Price” guarantee. But now, Walmart was too often getting beaten on price. So company executives were there, in part, to reset expectations with Walmart’s suppliers... Recode How the IBM 1403 printer hammered out 1,100 lines per minute Introduced in October 1959, IBM’s 1401 data-processing system was one of the first transistorized computers ever sold commercially. The 1401 marked the transition from wiring panels and punch cards to stored programs and magnetic tape drives, and it offered performance and versatility at a price that even small businesses could afford—about US $6,500 per month ($54,000 today). IEEE Spectrum VPNs are not the solution to a policy problem The US House of Representatives just voted to eliminate the FCC ISP privacy rules. If you are interested in a further reading about the details of said rules, this article is a good place to get started. As Americans begin to accept this new reality, the discourse shifts to what we can do to workaround this particular issue. Yes, VPNs are a workaround at best, and a shitty one at that. AsinineTech Twitter ditching default egg profile photos because they’re tied to “negative behavior” If you want to harass your fellow internet denizens on Twitter, you’ll have to do it without the cover of an anonymous egg in your profile photo: The social media site says it’s doing away with its default avatar, partly because it’s become associated with online harassment and other bad behaviors. The Consumerist A faster single-pixel camera Compressed sensing is an exciting new computational technique for extracting large amounts of information from a signal. In one high-profile demonstration, for instance, researchers at Rice University built a camera that could produce 2-D images using only a single light sensor rather than the millions of light sensors found in a commodity camera. MIT Virtual lemonade sends colour and taste to a glass of water When life hands you digital lemons, make virtual lemonade. A system of sensors and electrodes can digitally transmit the basic colour and sourness of a glass of lemonade to a tumbler of water, making it look and taste like a different drink. The idea is to let people share sensory experiences over the internet.

Murry and Kirbie Walker say it's not a perfect system, but they've made it work for them. Tuesday afternoon, with their two children in tow, the couple was headed to the grocery store, with a stop on a downtown bus bench as they waited for a transfer. It's a common sight on Second Street Southeast where the city's hub-and-spoke transit system gathers people from throughout Rochester and efficiently delivers them downtown for work, medical appointments or to catch a bus to another destination. But for the Walkers, even a trip from their home in north Rochester to Walmart North requires a downtown stop. Kirbie Walker said it's one of the things she'd like to see change. For Murry Walker the biggest change needed is expanded weekend service, especially for families, who rely on the system for all their transportation needs, "Especially on Sunday," Kirbie Walker said, echoing her husband's comments. "A lot of people go to church, and a lot of people have Sunday off." She said she noted as much when she took a recent survey regarding Rochester's bus service. She's not the only one seeing the need. Tuesday afternoon, Brad Lind was waiting for a bus to get to his job at Forager, but he noted Sunday service should be a priority. According the survey results, other community members also see the lack of adequate weekend service as one of the three largest unmet needs, along with the lack of evening hours and service gaps in parts of the city. Tuesday, during the Rochester City Council's committee of the whole meeting, Stuart Geltman, senior transit planner with Aecom, revealed how the public transit plan his company is preparing for Rochester will address such needs. The five-year plan lays out goals that include starting Sunday service in July, restructuring routes, clarifying route names and eventually establishing a direct route from downtown to Rochester International Airport. Expansion efforts also include the creation of a crosstown route as early as 2018 and adding buses throughout the plan, an effort that received an early boost last week with the award of a nearly $3 million state grant. Geltman noted the uncertainty of state and federal funding is being considered in the plan. While it will suggest a timeline for adding buses and expanding routes, he said implementation could fluctuate. "If funding gets tight, you can delay," he said, while noting other state grants could fast track parts of the plan. The estimated cost of expanded service wasn't as high as some Rochester City Council members expected. Mark Hickey questioned how routes could expand with the city planning to nearly double eventual service hours without doubling operating expenses. While the cost of new buses and facilities will spike expenses in 2018 and 2020, Geltman said operating costs are only expected to climb from $9.3 million to $14.6 million. With that, he said, local funding would actually drop from $2.35 million to $1.96 million. The drop comes with an expected $2 million increase in revenues, as well as expected increases in state funding due to increased ridership. Brian Law of Rochester Public Transit said the city department hopes to have the final plan ready to present in early May for a 30-day review before it heads to the city council.

Tim Ryan of Howland, D-13th, and Jaime Herrera Beutler, a Washington state Republican, introduced the Chronic Absenteeism Reduction Act on Monday. Chronic absenteeism is defined as missing 10 percent or more of the school year. Students who are chronically absent are 68 percent less likely than other students to graduate high school. The Chronic Absenteeism Reduction Act extends the allowable use of funds of Title IV-A block grants to allow schools the flexibility to invest in getting students to engage in academic programs before having to invest in enriching those programs. The bill allows schools to enact attendance programs that cater to their local needs by authorizing existing funds for schools to develop and implement effective strategies to combat chronic absence in schools.

The system will allow them to take bids from multiple buyer pools all at once. Published: April 4, 2017 7:33 AM Mobile publishers have been able to tap demand from Facebook Audience Network. The system will allow them to take bids from multiple buyer pools all at once. Social media leader Facebook has confirmed the integration of header bidding on its platform. Header bidding, which allows mobile web publishers to collect bids and then select the highest offer, and improve upon the original programmatic auctions, has been lauded by publishers. Facebook’s initial partners include Amazon Publisher Services, AppNexus, Index Exchange, Media.net, Sonobi and Sortable. These mobile publishers have been able to tap demand from Facebook Audience Network. The system will allow them to take bids from multiple buyer pools all at once. Due to advance bidding technology, publishers can make more money and earn up to 10-30% more revenues, when compared to programmatic advertising. With this, the cost to buy ads on the mobile web are set to go up as simultaneous bidding grows as all demand sources get the same information at the same time. This, however, experts suggest, will force mobile web prices to go up. Facebook has been testing this platform since August 2016 to counter Google’s ad platforms. Google’s Doubleclick has already adopted header bidding. A BI Intelligence report on header bidding says that nearly 70% of publishers now use header bidding technology. It further states that the technology offers many benefits for publishers and advertisers. “For publishers, header bidding offers a means to optimise yield, cut down on passbacks, increase transparency of inventory value, and eliminate Google’s favouritism for its own ad exchange, AdX. On the buy side, advertisers are given the opportunity to bid on all available inventory and not just remnant inventory like in a waterfall system,” says the report. Facebook says that its tests with publishers such as the Washington Post, Daily Mail and Forbes have shown header bidding through its Audience Network can increase revenue by 10-30%. YouTube faces the music Amidst growing concern over objectionable content on digital platforms, brands are taking all possible steps to guard themselves from appearing next to such content on YouTube and other Google-partnered websites. Havas Group UK recently decided on its clients’ behalf to pull out all of their advertising monies from YouTube and Google. The statement issued by the company said, “Havas Group UK has taken the decision on behalf of its UK clients, which include O2, Royal Mail, BBC, Domino’s and Hyundai Kia, to pause all YouTube and Google Display Network (GDN) investment until further notice.” The objectionable content includes videos promoting extremist content and terrorist organisations such as ISIS on Google-partnered websites near the content from brands. AT&T, Johnson & Johnson and Verizon have also announced that they would refrain from buying both video and text ads. McDonald’s, Walmart, Audi and Toyota are also pulling their ads from Google properties. In a blog post, Philipp Schindler, chief business officer of Google, assured increased brand safety levels and controls for advertisers. He wrote, “We know advertisers don’t want their ads next to content that doesn’t align with their values. So starting today, we are taking a tougher stance on hateful, offensive and derogatory content…We’ll offer advertisers and agencies more transparency and visibility on where their ads are running, and in the coming months we will expand availability of video-level reporting to all advertisers.” 1800 Tequila’s new video wins Hands down Building further on 1800’s strong relationship with the hip-hop community, the new ad from the brand called Hands establishes the tequila as the drink of choice for modern boundary-pushers. The film, which is garnering steam online, features a man who practices in a boxing ring during the day and plays piano in the nights at a jazz establishment.  The high-energy soundtrack Tap Dance from Octave Minds features Chance the Rapper who has given two verses to Hands. The new positioning, which goes with the tagline Just Refined Enough, tries to break through much abused liquor stereotypes and aims “to spark a new conversation about the multi-dimensional nature of modern masculinity”, according to the brand.  Created by CP+BLA, our protagonist in the ad — one-part pianist, one-part boxer — is shown approaching both tasks with  equal enthusiasm. Over the years, through partnerships with Billboard, 1800 has worked with various notable hip-hop artists including Rae Sremmurd, Travis Scott, Wale, Mike WiLL Made-It, etc. The aim of the brand has been to trace an artists’ roots and shed light on urban lifestyles. The latest viral by 1800 Tequila definitely hits the right notes with its protagonist and soundtrack matching up to the brand’s philosophy.

If it does, it will be for the first time since 2012. The Advertising Expenditure Forecast further says that London currently is the fourth biggest city globally, following New York, Tokyo and Los Angeles, for ad spends. It contributed £5.2 billion in 2017. The forecast also says that 2017 will see internet advertising attracting more monies than traditional TV advertising and newspaper advertising will be overshadowed by social media advertising. The report said that TV spends in the UK will shrink in the first quarter of 2017, due to decline in retail spends by 15% and drop in FMCG advertising by 12%. For 2017, the forecast predicts, global internet advertising expenditure will grow 13% to reach $205 billion. Internet advertising will attract 36.9% of all advertising expenditure, up from 34% in 2016, totalling $192 billion. “Internet advertising has contributed all of the growth in global ad spend since the beginning of the decade, and has stimulated much of the innovation we have seen in the market,” said Vittorio Bonori, Zenith’s global brand president. “Innovation is proceeding as fast as ever, and we believe that this is what will continue to drive brand growth for advertisers.” Gucci’s memes for digital world Gucci recently owned the meme landscape in the virtual world with #TFWGucci to launch its new watch collection, Le Marché des Merveilles. The brand commissioned international artists to develop original imagery which were then given to famous viral creators on Twitter and Instagram to turn into new memes for its timepieces. The results, which became a collection of the brand’s captioned art, were met with awe and criticism in equal measure. “Adapted from a popular meme, That Feeling When Gucci is about the moment of putting on one of the watches, when the world suddenly becomes different and time slows down a little bit,” announced the brand on its microsite. One of the most viral memes to garner over 80,000 likes, it was inspired by the Arthur meme. — Compiled by Ananya Saha Please Wait while comments are loading...

The goal that was set out by the Food Bank for the weekend was originally 35,000 pounds of food. A press release from the Food Bank reads, “Fort McMurray residents came together once again to prove that they are the most giving and supportive community, regardless of recent struggles they have faced this past year.” With the increase in need this year for the region the two day food drive held from Saturday, April 1st to Sunday, April 2nd had volunteers stationed at local grocery stores in Fort McMurray as well as Walmart and the Anzac Grocery store collecting donations. “In a time when our community is still reeling over past events it was so good to be able to have some many of our citizens come out to volunteer and donate to support those most vulnerable in our community. We recognize the great strain the citizens of our region face in so many ways right now and are eternally grateful for the kindness and generosity of all who give of their time, money, and food. The Staff and Board of the Wood Buffalo Food Bank want to thank everyone who supported the Servus Spring Food Drive, and a special thanks to our sponsors without whom this event would never get off the ground,” Said Executive Director of the Woof Buffalo Food Bank, Arianna Johnson. If you didn’t get the chance to help out this past weekend, the Food Bank is always looking for volunteers at their warehouse.

But the power Litwin wielded at the intersection of politics and business has also come under scrutiny in recent years, most notably in the corruption trials of two of New York State’s most formidable politicians, former Senate Majority Leader Dean Skelos (R-Rockville Centre) and former Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver (D-Manhattan). Glenwood had showered Republicans and Democrats with at least $13.4 million in contributions since 1999, according to a 2015 Newsday review. In February 2015, New York Public Interest Research Group officials testified in a legislative budget hearing that “through various entities and campaign accounts, real estate developer Leonard Litwin has given Governor Cuomo $1 million for the 2014 election cycle” and used loopholes in the law to give more than $1 million in a calendar year. Federal prosecutors alleged that Silver had induced “real estate developers with business before the state” to use a law firm that paid him kickbacks. advertisement | advertise on newsday Then-U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said one of the developers “was the largest political contributor in the state since 2005,” which is routinely identified as Glenwood, connecting Glenwood’s contributions to favorable treatment in Albany in both Skelos’ and Silver’s trials. But Litwin was also recalled as a kind philanthropist who helped spur medical research. He contributed to causes designed to fight cancer, Crohn’s disease and chronic fatigue syndrome in several New York institutions and hospitals, including Lenox Hill, Mount Sinai, NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center and Northwell Health, REBNY officials said. “He was very sharp,” said Peter Davies, director of the Litwin-Zucker Center. “I mean, when I first met him, he was over 90, but he was sharp as a tack.” Davies said the center Litwin established was the first serious institution devoted to the eradication of Alzheimer’s on Long Island, and published hundreds of papers and engaged in experimental and traditional clinical trials to combat the condition. Litwin, who also had homes in Great Neck and Manhattan, is survived by daughters Diane Miller, of Boca Raton, Florida, and Carole L. Pittelman, of Manhattan, who is an executive vice president for Glenwood. advertisement | advertise on newsday A memorial service for Litwin will be held on Wednesday at 2 p.m. at Temple Emanu-El, 1 E. 65th St. in Manhattan.

Kushner flew to Iraq with Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Joseph Dunford on Monday. Photo Credit: AP advertisement | advertise on newsday WASHINGTON - The Trump administration's failure to keep senior adviser Jared Kushner's trip to Iraq secret isn't standard practice for top U.S. officials visiting warzones. Such trips are usually kept quiet, with the cooperation of journalists, until the officials arrive in order to ensure maximum security. A senior administration official told reporters Sunday evening that Kushner — President Donald Trump's son-in-law — was in Iraq, even though he was still en route. For the military and security professionals managing the mission, the public disclosure of the unannounced trip was a security breach. Gen. Joseph Dunford, the Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman, also was on board. Most Popular Cops: 4 seriously injured in 5-car crash LIRR: Tuesday a.m. commute disrupted by derailment Melo on future: ‘I see the writing on the wall’ Syndergaard dominates in Mets' Opening Day win Police: Woman robbed Roosevelt Field store Although the plane landed safely in Baghdad on Monday, the Iraqi capital is hardly a secure location, having suffered countless extremist attacks over the years. The threat is no less acute today as Iraq wages a bitter battle to try to rid the Islamic State from its territory. For trips to the city, the military seeks to avoid public mention of plans ahead of time so extremist groups can't plot attacks. "It's been longstanding practice to strictly avoid announcing the visits of senior U.S. officials in advance of their travels to warzones," said George Little, a Pentagon and CIA press secretary for Leon Panetta, who managed both departments under President Barack Obama. "The main reason is obvious. You want to avoid giving the enemy any information that could help them to target these delegations, especially in areas where the battle lines aren't clear on the map." Knowing when and where a senior U.S. military or civilian official might arrive makes attacks easier. Such details could help groups target the plane as it takes off or lands, or use roadside bombs or shoulder-launched rockets to strike dignitaries while they're on the ground. NationOfficial: Trump senior adviser Jared Kushner travels to Iraq U.S. security details work with host countries to make sure routes and buildings are secure, trying to do so in the most inconspicuous manner possible. advertisement | advertise on newsday The choice of plane, too, is determined by danger level. In warzones, officials often fly more rugged combat aircraft, such as the Air Force's heavy C-17 transport plane. These can take off and land quicker on shorter runways. Steeper, corkscrew landings are sometimes preferred to minimize the threat from surface-to-air missiles. Reporters cooperate, too. Those traveling with top leaders into conflict areas must keep the trip secret, with reports generally "embargoed" until landing. Restrictions can be tighter on rare occasions. But these practices all are predicated on the administration not making the trip public prematurely. "The moment of vulnerability is, if they know you're coming, a surface-to-air missile going after the airplane," said Ari Fleischer, President George W. Bush's White House press secretary. "If you can diminish the time they know — and by the time you're there, the whole thing is a flood of security agents — it makes it almost impossible in theory for them to do anything bad." CommentaryOpinion: Kushner’s growing to-do list For the Trump administration, Kushner's voyage marks the second time a secret trip hasn't gone as planned. @Newsday Tweets from @Newsday/newsday-staff In February, the White House arranged for Trump to visit Dover Air Force Base in Delaware to honor the returning remains of a U.S. Navy SEAL killed a week earlier. In keeping with the practice of past White Houses, the trip wasn't announced. News organizations agreed not to report on the trip until after Trump arrived at the base. But unlike past occurrences, Trump left the White House in broad daylight in Marine One from the South Lawn of the White House, taking off in full view of pedestrians. The AP was forced to report that Trump had left the building. For the last 15 years, as Republican and Democratic presidents and Cabinet members have traveled in and out of Iraq and Afghanistan, media have largely adhered to the unwritten rules. In 2003, when then-President George W. Bush secretly traveled to Iraq to see troops on Thanksgiving Day, about a dozen reporters accompanying him had to hand over their cellphones, pagers and other electronics upon boarding Air Force One. They couldn't file stories while Bush was on the ground, only after he left Iraqi airspace. Nation30 people Trump has picked for Cabinet, top jobs There have been occasional mistakes and misunderstandings. Host countries sometimes spill the beans and Cabinet members also slip up, though rarely with details about flights as they're incoming. advertisement | advertise on newsday Security incidents aren't uncommon. When Defense Secretary Panetta's plane was taxiing after landing in Afghanistan in 2012, an Afghan contractor hijacked an SUV and tried to run down senior Marine officers waiting on the ramp to welcome the Pentagon chief. The contractor then set himself aflame inside the vehicle, forcing the plane to taxi elsewhere on the runway to avoid the fire. Officials said they didn't think the man knew about Panetta's arrival.

View CaptionHide Caption DeKalb County jail James Beard With two gunshots to the chest, a DeKalb County man is accused of killing his new wife in the doorway of their apartment. “The (victim’s) body was placed in the passenger seat of her car after being shot,” an arrest warrant for 42-year-old James Leon Beard alleges. “The victim’s four children were in the car and gave the same account of events.” Charged with murder, Beard said the gun “went off,” killing Angela Juanette Bishop late Friday, according to a police report.

Police records released Monday also don’t make clear why the body was put in the Toyota Camry, or why the children — whose ages range from 8 to 13 — were in the car.  Beard was arrested at his home on Panthersville Road outside Decatur, where police arrived to find the body. Beard said he’d heard a banging at the door and couldn’t see anyone through the peephole. He said the gun fired when he was opening the door. Bishop, 38, who had been a resident of Hartsville, South Carolina, was pronounced dead at the scene.

The suspect, Juan Davila, was taken to Denton City Jail in lieu of a $5,000 bond. He was charged with assault causing bodily injury. The woman, 47, was taken to a local hospital for treatment. Denton police Sgt. Keith Olson said Monday he did not know whether she had been released. He said she was suffering from head, back and chest pain when officers were on the scene. A third-party called police  about 6 p.m. Sunday after seeing a man pulling a woman by the hair, Olson said. Olson said weapons did not appear to be involved in the incident. Other reports 1400 block of Crystal Lake Drive — An elderly Little Elm man was found at his grandson's home in Edmond, Oklahoma, on Monday after he was reported missing on Sunday, according to a press release from the town of Little Elm. Joe Farris, 95, left his north Little Elm subdivision on Sunday and later appeared on security camera footage at a Wal-Mart on FM423 and Eldorado Parkway. The release said he had some form of dementia. His relatives were retrieving him from his grandson's home Monday. It's unclear how the man traveled to Oklahoma. The press release did not specify whether the man drove his vehicle. Little Elm police did not return calls for comment on Monday. 200 block of Inman Street — A 20-year-old man reportedly was robbed at gunpoint early Sunday morning at The Forum at Denton Station Student Apartments, according to a police report. The suspect, who was not identified, got away with the man's cellphone, the report said. The report did not include further information, and no arrests were made. Last week, during an unrelated incident, a man was arrested at the same apartment complex after police said he robbed a 21-year-old woman in the parking lot. The suspect attempted to take the woman's cellphone and keys during that incident, police said. The suspect, Kevin Walker, is in custody. 1500 block of South Loop 288 — Police arrested a 36-year-old man on a criminal trespassing charge at a Wal-Mart before they found marijuana in his possession at the city jail, according to a police report. The man previously was issued a notice of criminal trespassing at the Wal-Mart, the report said. Officers later found the marijuana during a search at the jail. He was charged with criminal trespassing and possession of marijuana. 300 block of North Wood Street — A 53-year-old man reportedly was burglarizing coin-operated machines at Roy's Wash N' Dry early Sunday morning when police arrested him on burglary and drug charges. Police arrived at the laundromat about 3 a.m. when they found the man, according to police report.

This is after the MSP Alpena Post got a report from a someone saying they’d received a call saying their grandchild was in trouble and needed money. The caller told the grandparent not to contact the child’s parent, but demanded the grandparent pay immediately with $4,000 in Walmart gift cards. The MSP says the callers will make the grandparents believe it’s a real incident, when it’s actually a scam. At no time should a grandparent send money to anyone via Green Dot Money or other types of gift cards over the phone. Once the caller gets the numbers and pin from the back of the card, the money is almost instantly gone. The caller gives just enough to detail to make the story believable, but does not provide specific details. If you receive this sort of call, police say you should not give them any information or buy the gift cards. Be sure to contact the parent of the grandchild to confirm any story the caller tells you. And if the calls continue, tell the caller you know it’s a scam and that you’ve notified law enforcement. 7-Day Forecast Around our Area Schuss Mountain’s Annual Snow Challenge Bubble Soccer Fundraiser Volleyball Team Uses Dodgeball for Fundraiser Lampwork Glass Artist Looks to Share Talent What is CERT?

He said Sam’s Club has offered curbside pickup for more than 15 years. It was first called ‘click and collect.” “It began when companies started faxing in their orders,” he said during a recent speech at the ShopTalk Conference in Las Vegas As Sam’s Club grew its membership to include families as well as businesses, the service is growing in demand. Sam’s Club began building dedicated pickup locations adjacent to the clubs about two years ago, first testing it in Bentonville. Sam’s Club also allowed customers to check-in with their smartphone via the Sam’s Club app, which is also equipped with a scan & go feature that allows members shopping inside clubs to bypass the checkout lines. Iannone said the prototype for the drive-through lanes are in Bentonville. He said the drive-through lanes and mobile check-in has shaved time off the process and customers spend as little as 30 seconds picking up items they ordered online. Retailers understand that time is the new currency for busy families and business owners. Wal-Mart Stores CEO Doug McMillon recently said having the best prices isn’t enough because consumers also want convenience and that’s often as important than lowest price. Iannone said timing is also crucial for product quality when almost half of the orders it fills include fresh and frozen items. He said successful Club pickup depends on e-commerce capacities that have near perfect in-store inventory accuracy, reiterating that all items have to be online whether purchased digitally or in clubs. Iannone said business customers also expect their orders to be complete, which is important for restaurant customers who re-stock each day. He also said Sam’s Club has been testing business delivery from stores in a couple of markets. He did not indicate that this test would expand, but did say the service has resonated well with members. In June 2016 Iannone told Talk Business & Politics the enhancements that Sam’s Club made with the mobile check-in, drive through collection and automatic recorder helped increase the business by 46% year-over-year. RetailWire recently asked experts to quantify how much of an advantage Sam’s Club might gain from incorporating technology into services like club pickup and scan & go. They were also asked which was more significant club pickup or scan & go. Overwhelmingly, the retail consultants and insiders said club pickup was the bigger move of the two. Charles Dimov, director of marketing for OrderDynamics, said Sam’s Club doing pickup is “a no brainer.” “Costco has not yet started any heavy foray into omnichannel — so, advantage Sam’s. For many customers, thinking of going to a big box warehouse retailer is a bit of a hassle. Mid-week, no problem. But try your luck on a weekend and it can be a crowded zoo. Going the click-and-collect route makes sense for many customers. The warehouse retail business is ideally suited for click-and-collect. It helps Sam’s cater to another group of customers who don’t like the lineup and hustle and bustle. … I am expecting to hear big things from this early start for Sam’s,” Dimov noted. W. Frank Dell II, president of Dellmart & Company said Sam’s Club Pickup is what the business customer wants. “The owner can order and pay online and send an associate to pick up. Most business customer are not on treasure hunt shopping trips. This saves the business customer time. Sam’s doesn’t have to train an employee to walk the store. Merchandise is available any time of the work day, reducing their business inventory,” he noted. The consults also believe Sam’s Club investments in pickup and scan & go will give it a competitive advantage over Costco. Loyal Costco customer, James Tenser, principal at VSN Strategies, said he was impressed with Iannone’s recent discussion about club pickup. “It makes sense to design service experiences for high-value business customers. I’ve been a loyal Costco member for many years, but I’m heading over to our local Sam’s this afternoon to see their process in action,” Tenser noted. Carol Spieckerman, CEO of Spieckerman Retail, has praised Sam’s Club for its forward-thinking strategies of club pickup and scan & go. “It’s great to see Sam’s making some bold moves when it comes to technology and more specifically, bringing digital innovation into the club environment,” Spieckerman told Talk Business & Politics  in June. She said many Sam’s members are business owners and therefore are more technologically aware and savvy. Successful entrepreneurs have to stay on top of innovation in order to drive efficiencies in their businesses and to keep pace with their own customers, particularly through mobile-forward solutions. Secondly, the business and family focus for Sam’s members (that justify buying in larger quantities) also point to the need for convenience and time management. The solutions that Sam’s is rolling out cover both of these criteria, Spieckerman said. Not everyone thinks saving people time will necessarily build bottomline profits, especially if the model is built around browsing and treasure hunting. While it makes sense on a convenience level, Kai Clarke, CEO of American Retail Consultants, said pickup is “a concierge service which might be a profitable segment with some of Sam’s club offerings, but it has to have an impact on costs.” Clarke adds: “The entire club model is built upon a choose your own, browse the aisle, extra-large size, super discounted, product offerings. This seems to go against this model. I doubt it will be successful in all clubs in the longer term.” Comments comments Previous post Oil producers invest 72% more in capital in 4Q Next post Lawmakers reject Amazon tax bill, enter recess Talk Business & Politics by email Arkansas headlines delivered to you on demand Email address Statewide Newsletter Northeast Arkansas Newsletter Fort Smith Newsletter Northwest Arkansas Newsletter Submit Advertisement Search Talk Business & Politics Search for: Opinion Scott Cashion What we’ve done in the name of national security Gov.

Screen Rant You Are Reading: Alien: Covenant Fan Events Announced for Alien Day 2017 Share On Facebook Comments (1) Next Follow Us Follow @screenrant SR EXCLUSIVES MOVIE NEWS TV NEWS REVIEWS VIDEOS LISTS + QUIZZES TRAILERS PODCASTS TOP MOVIES Comics Gaming Up Next 8 Shares ShareOn Facebook Tweet Share Email Share Share Pin It Share Comment Alien: Covenant Fan Events Announced for Alien Day 2017 By Todd Sokolove 11 hours ago 1 Comment 8 Shares ShareOn Facebook Tweet Share Email Share Share Pin It Share Comment 20th Century Fox has announced fan events for the upcoming “Alien Day” 2017 event, about a month before the latest installment in the series, Alien: Covenant, hits theaters. The Alien franchise has so far grossed some $1.2 billion, over the course of several film releases. Its unique mix of horror and science fiction has set the course for Alien: Covenant, arguably the most anticipated entry in the anthology to date. Excitement for Covenant is only made more impressive when you consider it’s been nearly 38 years since the original film chest-bursted its way into (or technically out of) the hearts of filmgoers worldwide. Alien has since had a fan-base, especially within genre circles, but merchandising in the form of books, graphic novels, video-games, and even plush Facehuggers, extended the appeal of our favorite Xenomorphs. Last year, Fox had success with their Alien Day to celebrate the 30th anniversary of Aliens. Now, Fox has unveiled even bigger plans for the return of Alien Day this April 26th. With a nod to Alien franchise planet LV-426, Earth’s 4/26 will mark a 24 hour celebration, building the countdown to Ridley Scott’s Alien: Covenant release worldwide in May.  Cast members from the newest Alien film will join a number of festivities focused on the fans, including a live streaming event, an interactive trivia game, worldwide screenings, new product launches, special reveals, and more. Alien Day fan activity details are as follows (go to AlienUniverse.com for the full details): Livestreaming event from Fox Studios in LA – Interact with the cast via a question and answer session as well as view multiple behind-the-scenes segments highlighting the making of Alien: Covenant. Global One-Night Screening Event – Screenings of Ridley Scott’s original 1979 ALIEN starring Sigourney Weaver and his 2012 follow-up PROMETHEUS will be held across the globe on ALIEN DAY.  At participating RPX Regal Cinema U.S. theaters and worldwide partners, fans can watch these sci-fi thrillers and be treated with exclusive content from ALIEN: COVENANT and a one-of-a-kind commemorative item. The “MU/TH/UR of all ALIEN Trivia Challenges” – Fox will unveil a new quiz every 4 hours and 26 minutes. Fans will answer a series of rapid-fire questions for a chance to win a VIP trip to Ridley Scott’s upcoming Imprint Ceremony at TCL Chinese Theatre in Hollywood and incredible prizes. Fan Art Contest – Submit your artwork, which could be transformed into a limited edition t-shirt premium. That shirt will be made available with the purchase of the ALIEN: COVENANT Blu-Ray and 4K Ultra HD, exclusively at Wal-Mart stores and Walmart.com.  In addition to Alien Day events, in which you’re encouraged to come up with your own ways to celebrate what you love about the films, there will be more to stay tuned for. In the weeks ahead, and through the theatrical premiere of Covenant, Fox promises product announcements, limited edition releases and exciting unveils. Among the key licensees joining the ALIEN DAY celebration: Dark Horse Comics, Audible, Titan, NECA, Hallmark, PPW Toys, Cool Props, and Funko. You’ll find multiple retailers rolling out merchandise, including BoxLunch, FYE/TWE, Books-A-Million, and Spencer’s Gifts (showcasing exclusive franchise merchandise). If you’re a hardcore fan of the Alien franchise, and its incarnations on physical home video, you’ll need to make room next to your VHS, Laserdiscs, DVDs, and Blu-rays, (both Alien Quadrilogy and Anthology editions of the later) for yet another set. The complete Alien Universe Blu-ray will feature four limited-edition Mondo ALIEN movie poster cards (available exclusively at Wal-Mart and Walmart.com on April 18). Last, but not least, Fox is partnering with Madame Tussauds to announce on 4/26 a “terrifying arrival” at one of their iconic locations this summer, because apparently wax figures aren’t creepy enough. For more information on all Alien Day activities, keep checking AlienUniverse.com. Fans can join in the conversation on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram with the hashtag #AlienDay.

Hundreds of those companies said that pursuing a low-carbon future was good for their businesses and their brands. At issue, of course, is the Clean Power Plan that aims to cut the country’s carbon emissions by 32% by 2030 using a variety of strategies that include the use of more renewables and trading carbon credits. But the plan, opposed mostly by states that are dependent on coal production and coal-fired electricity, is now stalled in the courts. Through the executive order, Trump is essentially saying that his administration will stop defending the case in the courts. “Strong clean energy and climate policies, like the Clean Power Plan, can make renewable energy supplies more robust and address the serious threat of climate change while also supporting American competitiveness, innovation, and job growth,” Apple, Amazon, Google and Microsoft said in response to the executive order signed last week. “We believe that investing in a low-carbon economy will not only help foster a healthier environment, it is also a key to unlocking new business growth potential for the US and around the world,” the companies continued, as reported by Bloomberg. The tech giants are joined by Anheuser Busch, the Gap, General Electric, Mars and WalMart, each of whom has committed to reducing their carbon emissions and to using far more renewable energy. To what effect will the executive order have not just on the Clean Power Plan but also the effort to go green, generally? Most experts believe the momentum toward a low-carbon economy will outlast Trump’s presidency. At most, they say that some utilities could decide to extend the life of older coal plants that they had planned to retire. But the key point they make is that wiping out the regulation necessitates more than just the president’s signature. It will require acts of Congress — and laws that could override the US Supreme Court’s earlier decisions. At least half the states, furthermore, are requiring renewable portfolio standards. Companies, meanwhile are investing directly in wind and solar projects, or they are agreeing to buy the output under long-term contracts.  In 2007, the Supreme Court ruled that carbon dioxide is a pollutant that could be regulated under the Clean Air Act—something that EPA made official in 2009, saying it was a danger to public health and welfare. And in 2014, the high court upheld that so-called endangerment finding. That ruling is the foundation behind President Obama’s Clean Power Plan. But in February 2016, the Supreme Court issued a “stay” to address some concerns of several states before sending the case back to the DC Court of Appeals, where a decision is expected soon. No matter how it rules, it will head back to the high court, which is now evenly split on the Clean Power Plan. “We believe climate change is real and the science is well accepted,” Jeffrey Immelt, chief executive of GE wrote to his employees last week, which was first reported by Politico. “This is just the beginning of what will be a long process … but no matter how it unfolds, it doesn’t change what G.E. believes.” The company, which manufacturers not just wind turbines and solar panels but also the generators used for coal and natural gas plants, has said that would either buy or generate all of its electricity from renewable sources by 2050. WalMart, meanwhile, is the first retailer with an emissions-reduction plan approved by the Science Based Targets Initiative, in alignment with the Paris Climate Agreement in December 2015, the company says. Under the approved plan, Walmart will use a combination of energy-efficiency measures and renewable energy to achieve an 18% emissions reduction in its own operations by 2025. Additionally, Walmart will work with suppliers to reduce emissions by 1 gigaton by 2030, which it says is the equivalent to taking more than 211 million passenger vehicles off of U.S. roads and highways for a year. To be sure, some industries will benefit from the change in carbon policies. As Trump said to the coal miners present when he signed the executive order weakening the Clean Power Plan, “You’re going back to work.” While that’s unclear at the moment, it does appear that oil and natural gas pipeline operators will have a less onerous time constructing infrastructure as evidenced by the Trump administration’s support of the Keystone XL Pipeline. Similarly, the insurers that underwrite those projects will also benefit. About 50 or so companies insure for pollution legal liability, reports Business Insurance. But the riskier projects such as oil pipelines are a tougher sell to some of those insurers, the publication adds. Renewable energy projects, in contrast, are often welcomed with open arms.

April 3, 2017 11:29 AM   Subscribe Amazon Wants Cheerios, Oreos and Other Brands to Bypass Wal-Mart Amazon.com Inc. has invited some of the world's biggest brands to its Seattle headquarters in an audacious bid to persuade them that it's time to start shipping products directly to online shoppers and bypass chains like Wal-Mart, Target and Costco. posted by entropicamericana (106 comments total) 5 users marked this as a favorite   Anything that knocks the Waltons off their perch is A-OK by me. posted by ThePinkSuperhero at 11:30 AM on April 3 [7 favorites] On the other hand, anything that harms Costco is not OK with me. posted by zippy at 11:34 AM on April 3 [27 favorites] Shame to see Amazon driving out these mom and pop stores. posted by bondcliff at 11:44 AM on April 3 [15 favorites] Who will speak for our beloved cereal box mascots on this? posted by JoeZydeco at 11:46 AM on April 3 [1 favorite] If Amazon can convince cereal producers to start selling boxes that are more than 1/4" thick again, I'll buy from them. The endless trend of making the boxes taller and thinner just to keep the price down drives me nuts - I'll happily pay more per box to be able to get more than one bowl out of the damn package.

Get Hollywood on the phone! I've got a helluva pitch for Food Fight 2! posted by Strange Interlude at 11:49 AM on April 3 [9 favorites] Manufacturers would have to re-imagine everything from the way products are made to how they're packaged. Laundry detergent could come in sturdier, leak-proof containers. Instead of flimsy packages designed to pop on store shelves, cookies, crackers and cereal could be packed in durable, unadorned boxes. Plants could spit out products for individuals rather than trucks-full of inventory. Unless they're also talking about ways of reusing all that upgraded packaging, this mostly sounds like a recipe for increased waste. posted by fifthrider at 11:51 AM on April 3 [10 favorites] The ubiquity of Amazon is actually a form of redlining. Now, I don't use Amazon, anyway, but the truth is that people in my neighborhood really can't. There is nowhere safe to leave a delivery - anything you left out would be stolen in a minute. And many people work odd shifts anyway, plus they work at places where you can't get packages delivered. And to top that off, many low-income people don't have credit card access. So when something isn't available in a big box store, it either must be bought in a convenience store at a jacked up price, or can't be bought at all. And any discounts available via Amazon are not accessible to most low income people. I'm fortunate in that a friend in a different neighborhood can accept packages for me, but I don't like to lean on her goodwill too much. Many people would say "oh, who cares if the poor can't get oreos, they can just get the store brand", but it's still kind of a drag - and it seems likely to be extended to more products if this goes through. Frankly, the people who suffer most from the disappearance of actual stores are the people who for one reason or another can't order online. posted by Frowner at 11:52 AM on April 3 [81 favorites] Geez.

Excellent point, that does put a silver lining on it! posted by aka burlap at 12:06 PM on April 3 Aaaaaaannd....in low-income areas, post offices are fewer and farther between, with reduced hours and staff! Also, a look in my city shows that there are literally no Amazon lockers here - there are a number in the suburbs, of course. I am not kidding - it is difficult to access these things in low income areas, especially the core low income areas, partly because even the work-arounds are created on the assumption that you live near other services and/or have a car and/or work a normal schedule. I live in one of the largest neighborhoods in the city, and one of the poorest - we were mashed together into one neighborhood to give us less clout, basically. posted by Frowner at 12:08 PM on April 3 [40 favorites] zippy: On the other hand, anything that harms Costco is not OK with me. I live in Seattle (proper, where we have but a single Costco inside the city limits) and maybe this is off topic, but...I just don't see the appeal of Costco. Maybe I'm doing it wrong but I vastly prefer Amazon Fresh and its kin. Either way, I'm paying a membership fee. Either way, I get "cash back" on purchases (via Amazon Store Card). Either way, I can have a massive stack of toilet paper on offer. But, at least with Amazon Fresh or Pantry, I don't have to buy 75 ramen bowls at a single sitting. Or lug it out to my car. Or, and this is my least favorite of all, dive head-first into a Costco that is always packed to the gills. (I mean, seriously? I've tried going mid-day mid-week, packed. Early morning, weekend? Packed. Late evening, any day? Packed. Where are all of these people coming from???) At least Costco has much better labor practices going for it, which is nice, but I can't hardly get into the darn things to patronize them, and I have an 800sqft house so I've nowhere to put the stuff (but that's secondary because I'm sure I could make it fit). posted by fireoyster at 12:12 PM on April 3 [4 favorites] Frowner: "I am not kidding - it is difficult to access these things in low income areas, especially the core low income areas, partly because even the work-arounds are created on the assumption that you live near other services and/or have a car and/or work a normal schedule.

In that case, while yes, Amazon's services are discriminatory in fact, it's hardly fair to accuse them of redlining when they've made in-roads to traditionally underserved communities by setting up Amazon Locker or working with UPS or the USPS. I'm hardly the biggest fan of Amazon, but I think they've done well here. posted by TypographicalError at 12:18 PM on April 3 [11 favorites] I live in Seattle and maybe this is off topic, but...I just don't see the appeal of Costco.

If it's the post office, if the package doesn't fit in my tiny mailbox I'm probably not getting the package. If I'm not home when FedEx comes by I'm not getting the package. There is an amazon locker station at the nearby grocery store but that kind of defeats the purpose???? posted by bleep at 12:22 PM on April 3 [1 favorite] Aaaaaaannd....in low-income areas, post offices are fewer and farther between, with reduced hours and staff!

This recalls one of my all-time favorite things from The Onion, March 14, 2001: Starbucks to Begin Sinister "Stage Two" of Operation. posted by something something at 12:26 PM on April 3 [7 favorites] One of the areas in which I consider myself almost absurdly fortunate is my access to retail. Costco is my closest Big Box (with a pharmacy that has a discount deal with my insurance), with Target just a little farther away. Two major supermarket chains and two locally-owned stores within reach I can compare fresh food prices from. And my almost-rural location (most of my neighbors are in trailer homes; I'm not) with a large front porch, reliable before-noon delivery from UPS and FedEx and a usual mailcarrier I know personally. I have short lists of things I buy from each source (including Costco, which is why my freezer and pantry are always full). But I do wish somebody would find a way to successfully compete directly with Amazon because I have a very rational fear of monopolies. I'm keeping an eye on jet.com even though it's apparently part of WallyMart. posted by oneswellfoop at 12:27 PM on April 3 [2 favorites] So, when the power goes out, or there's a storm in the forecast and it's a good idea to stock up for the few days of inclement weather, we're supposed to order online how, exactly? Amazon needs to learn how to stay in its lane. There's a need for being able to go to a store and getting something immediately. Trying to convince major brands to go online-only is like trying to convince the Mayo Clinic to dole out medical advice strictly through WebMD. If they want to compete with retailers that have stores, then they should do what everyone else does and open stores. posted by Autumnheart at 12:33 PM on April 3 [7 favorites] If they want to compete with retailers that have stores, then they should do what everyone else does and open stores. They've run into a little snag: Amazon's checkout-free physical shop 'can't cope with more than 20 people' Specifically, the new shop can’t handle tracking more than about 20 people at the same time, and freaks out “if an item has been moved from its specific spot on the shelf” the paper writes, citing un-named sources. [...] “For now, the technology functions flawlessly only if there are a small number of customers present, or when their movements are slow,” the Journal reports.posted by cynical pinnacle at 12:39 PM on April 3 [1 favorite] As an employee of the company that was accused of being "Amazon's Showroom" for a few consecutive years, all I can say is....payback's a bitch. Retail is really a fascinating industry, especially from a logistics point of view in bridging multiple channels. Amazon has created an incomprehensibly huge advantage for itself in being *the* online retailer by a huge margin. It should stick with that, and learn how to maximize it. Own your niche. Branching into brick-retailing is a known industry, and pretty much every other retailer has a 50-odd year head start, particularly where property is concerned. So, if I were working for Amazon, and thankfully I am not (I read that NYT article! Yikes), I would not be recommending this whole "store that isn't a store" kind of thing. If existing retailers are struggling with finding the sweet spot between selection and square footage, Amazon isn't going to magically reinvent that wheel. If I really wanted to talk crazy, I'd tell Amazon to buy the USPS. Voila. You've got a location in every wide spot in the road in America. posted by Autumnheart at 12:45 PM on April 3 [3 favorites] I may be a little bit old fashioned - but I think it's not a particularly great idea that people get more and more isolated from one another. I really notice that people no longer seem to know how to interact in public spaces anymore. Simple 'hello's', 'pardon me's', and 'excuse me's' are rapidly evaporating from how we deal with strangers. It's not a matter of people not being rude - but simply not knowing what to do - we are increasingly ignorant of how to interact. When I was a kid - grocery shopping was a bit of adventure, because you could see what other people ate (someone needs to recreate Woodward's World of Food Floor in Vancouver) - and that made other people, less "other". I love that I can go to my local everyday grocery store and see North American, Persian, Chinese, and Latin American products in one place. I have asked - and been asked - how to use a particular product that was not part of an everyday shopping list. Amazon does a lot of interesting and good things - but creating communities is not one of them. posted by helmutdog at 12:47 PM on April 3 [10 favorites] aerotive: "Don't see how this can ever be more than a niche thing for products that are large, heavy, and cheap---all of which describe cereal."

Amazon's "disruption" of brick-n-mortar chains comes at the cost of the store worker, and a study suggests the knock-on effects of delivery trucks may worsen traffic congestion and transport-related carbon emissions, so that time-saving from shopping online instead of locally in stores isn't a net benefit. Add in the mountains of packaging to deliver a few goods quickly, and personal convenience is coming at a greater public cost (writes the guy who ordered a CD via Amazon and received it on Sunday, in an oversized bubble padded package, from a USPS delivery person). posted by filthy light thief at 1:02 PM on April 3 [5 favorites] I can't see Wal-Mart being super-friendly to Amazon lockers for much longer if they're stealing business posted by scruss at 1:04 PM on April 3 I'm not looking forward to comparison shopping amazon to find fiber and sugar content in the different brands of oat-o's and crunchy flakes on their complicated product pages.

Well, okay, that's a tremendously expensive process that apparently the manufacturers would assume. Amazon can give these companies some interesting ideas, but where exactly do they make more money by selling through Amazon instead of traditional retail? He notes that Amazon has 300 million shoppers and can make its own products if brands aren’t willing to sell on its marketplace. Ha. Okay. I don't think brands are indestructible by any stretch, but sure, go ahead and come up with an Amazon competitor for Oreos and see if anybody fucking buys it. Amazon's built its entire website strategy around showing up in search whenever you search for anything. It's a lousy website to browse, but it's a great website if you already know what you want. No matter what that is, you're probably going to get a banner or a top search result that points right to that item on Amazon's website. How, then, are they going to market new, unknown products on a website that depends on name recognition? Especially ones that compete directly with well-established, beloved brands? How will that differ from any other store brand? And why would anybody go to Amazon to order faux-reos that they won't even get for 2 days, when they can run down to the corner and buy the real thing in 10 minutes? Maybe there's a roadmap somewhere in Amazon's corporate depths on how this would feasibly be accomplished, but from my chair it sounds like a lot of hot air, right up there with delivery drones. posted by Autumnheart at 1:09 PM on April 3 [4 favorites] Frowner: " people in my neighborhood really can't.

Bezos is richer than the Waltons -- in fact he's the second-richest person on earth. -- Willing to leverage their corporate weight to hurt suppliers? They've done it again and again. -- Bad for workers? Walmart and Amazon actually sometimes use the same contractors in the same warehouses.

I just did a quick check for post offices and Amazon lockers in Oakland, CA. There's -2- lockers in Oakland. One in Claremont, and one in Jack London Square. Not a single one in or around any non-gentrified areas. As for post offices, the distribution of them in lower income areas is shocking. FFS, in Alameda alone, we have 3 locker locations, and 4 post offices.

Picking out different things, seeing what is new, bumping into neighbours and friends. groceries usually involves several different stores - green grocer, bakery, deli, Fishmonger, a regular grocery store for basics. I don't even mind hauling my kids along with me. What is the fun of just checking a list of stuff online? I hate hate hate going to Costco though. posted by fimbulvetr at 1:14 PM on April 3 [2 favorites] I realize this isn't possible for everyone but people really should be prepared for disaster 24x7 not just when forecasted. I agree, but if you live in a small apartment or whatever, it makes more sense to stock up once you are fully informed about how long you might be stuck inside, and that information usually isn't available until immediately before the disaster. Otherwise, it's not really feasible to keep a stash of food and water on hand that you aren't gonna use up right away. I'm a single person with one fridge, and I find Costco to be very beneficial for produce and deli items, vitamins, towels and bedding, frozen foods, paper products, things like furnace filters and toothbrush heads, and small appliances. Even cut flowers. And gas! Of course Costco is good for buying bulk items if you need them, but even if you're just shopping for yourself, the quality of Kirkland stuff is typically quite good for the price, and you really do save a lot of money on things you might only buy once a year or so. I try to go to Costco on a weeknight (preferably a Tuesday, the quietest day of the week in retail) and avoid the zoo. If you have a local sports franchise, go when they're playing. The place will be deader than Elvis. posted by Autumnheart at 1:20 PM on April 3 [6 favorites] Secure parcel receiving is a solved problem. There are lots of parcel drop boxes to choose from. Worry not, 90 year old scraping by on Social Security and unable to access most banking systems, you only have to spend $300-500 on a safe to keep on your porch and then separately convince all the various delivery services to use. Problem. Solved. The underlying problems that Frowner raised are serious and not easy to solve, and I wish we were doing much more, not because I want to see Amazon succeed (because fuck them generally), but because most of them are inherently good things like access to the Internet, banking systems, and secure delivery of mail that many people take completely for granted and assume are available to everyone with no struggle, when they plainly aren't. posted by Copronymus at 1:25 PM on April 3 [21 favorites] lol at someone using cars as a metaphor for progress ityol 2017 posted by entropicamericana at 1:29 PM on April 3 Frowner: " people in my neighborhood really can't.

Who's our audience? 2. Do we care about people who are not our audience? Yes/no 3. Who's our competition? 4. What can we offer that they don't? A basic SWOT analysis will put most of that on paper. (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) If they want to capture the grocery market by reinventing how people shop for groceries, that's going to require a hell of a lot more innovating and technology than is currently available to, say, half the country. They'd do a lot better by finding an unserved or under-served niche and building on that. For example, getting Amazon packages to rural areas. (Which is where my crazy idea to buy the USPS comes in.) Secured package drops, sufficient staffing, storage for perishables. Walmart built its empire on becoming the single source for rural areas (I'm not claiming that was in the best interest of the citizenry, but it made for a profitable business) and there's still plenty of room to innovate for companies that have the resources to do it, and Amazon does. If they managed to figure that out, they might very well succeed in seeding new communities because now living in the sticks isn't a barrier to convenience. But putting Amazon lockers next to Walmart and Target isn't a winning idea (* except for people who are already customers of Amazon and those other retailers). People don't want to have to go to umpteen places to pick up their stuff, that's why online shopping AND big-box retail are both things. posted by Autumnheart at 1:39 PM on April 3 Prime Pantry is garbage. A ton of things I used to be able to buy individually with free shipping can now only be bought as part of a Pantry box, to which I need to add an indeterminate number of items to not pay $5.99 in shipping costs. I get that the free shipping may have been a loss-maker for them, but Prime was initially marketed as free shipping on all Prime-eligible items, only now to have a bunch of that stuff become unavailable unless you buy them as part of a Pantry box, for which you have to pay shipping unless you manage to hit the mystery number of items to get the free shipping (they say five items, but I've tried several times with up to eight or nine items and still not hit the threshold for free shipping so gave up). Plus, only the premium name brands are available, so tough luck for people who would rather source at least some of their household items from cheap or generic brands. Luckily I'm in a position where I can easily access Target, Walgreens or Costco for my basic household items. If it weren't for the movies and music (which I still use somewhat infrequently, so not really sure if it's worth it), I'd have gotten rid of Prime as soon as I realized that one of the main benefits that I signed up for was effectively gone. posted by triggerfinger at 1:43 PM on April 3 [5 favorites] I'm guessing there's a money threshold that you have to hit before it kicks in ($35, $50?) and/or that there needs to be a minimum of qualified items. But they should publish that so people know. And they should take care to curate their qualified items so that non-eligible ones don't accidentally make the list. Suckering people in with a promise of free shipping, and then forcing them to play tag with the fulfillment conditions so they don't actually get the deal, is a great way to kill brand loyalty. Whoever's on their business team over there is being penny-wise and pound-foolish. I'm sure their AOV (average order value) numbers look great, but they'd be a lot better off if they just included fewer things in Prime and Pantry, if they're spending too much money shipping items that don't make up the profit margin. It's a lot better for brand perception if customers are given a consistent price, than to say they get a discount and then tell them "just kidding" at checkout. That's how you get people abandoning their carts and going to the competition. posted by Autumnheart at 1:56 PM on April 3 [1 favorite] There is definitely underservice/bad logistics for poor neighborhoods, that's a thing and it's one that should be worked on. There are people who like going to the grocery store and have the physical ability, transportation, childcare, situational safety, mental health resources, and inclination to do it, and that's incentive for brick-and-mortar stores to compete. That doesn't necessarily mean Amazon shouldn't sell its services to the people who want to and are able to use them. Maybe grocery stores should work harder on accessibility and opening up more than three checkstands at 5:30pm on a weekday. Maybe they should offer neighborhood shuttle services and delivery (that isn't based on a nightmare website or literally having to drive around back to the creepy loading dock to pick up your order, Ralphs in Granada Hills) in order to better compete. I mean, if Walmart or Safeway(etc) leaned in a little, they could be running a (profitable, or at the very least an excellent loss-leader) smalltown/neighborhood public transportation system hubbed at their stores. (This, tangentially, is something that most US transit orgs seem to not understand compared to European and Asian counterparts. Every hub should have commercial retail space built into it.) And why would anybody go to Amazon to order faux-reos that they won't even get for 2 days, when they can run down to the corner and buy the real thing in 10 minutes? Generally my need for cookies is not so urgent that I can't wait two days, since buying the real thing in the LA suburbs involves a) a car and a drive on congested surface streets because I live near a giant university campus so it's never not some kind of rush hour b) 25-30 minutes minimum to do that and wait in line at the one checkstand c) just for cookies? For actual groceries I tend to load up my Amazon Fresh cart over 3-5 days (so I reach the $40 free delivery threshold) to have dropped on my doorstep (often before 7am the next morning, often by USPS), and I just plan my cookie purchases and consumption to flow pretty seamlessly from one order to the next. Almost all our staple household items are now Subscribe & Save deliveries that come on the 7th of the month. I do go to a physical store 2-3 times a month for a few very specific items I can't get brought to me, but at this point since I work from home I rarely even use my car most of the week now. (Pantry is seriously bullshit. It's such a pain in the ass.) Amazon makes their free delivery thresholds about as clear as is possible, marked on every item as you shop so you can tell what qualifies and what doesn't, there's not a ton of mystery around it; they've been fine-tuning it with Prime users for years. I have the advantage of some of Amazon's best service because of where I live, but it wouldn't take much to compete with that in less-populated areas, or even in poorer areas. I wonder how much of that is unwillingness to cooperate (much less incentivize) on the parts of local governments. posted by Lyn Never at 2:07 PM on April 3 [5 favorites] We are witnessing a Tipping Point in America where The Massive Retailer That's Way Too Powerful And Needs Disrupting Badly is changing from Walmart to Amazon. posted by oneswellfoop at 2:15 PM on April 3 [6 favorites] Secure parcel receiving is a solved problem. There are lots of parcel drop boxes to choose from. When someone tells you something is a problem for a huge swath of society, jumping in to say "no it isn't, this problem has been solved" is incredibly myopic. Especially since at least one of your links does not appear to exist in this person's country, let alone their underserved neighborhood. I also live in a city neighborhood where getting packages is still a problem, because of access to buildings (deliverymen don't have badges to get where they need to go), because of things on front porches being tempting for random passersby, because there literally are not any local big box stores that offer this service, because the nearest post office has restrictive open hours, because a lot of people who live there don't have cars in order to transport packages back from a drop off location which kind of sucks if the package is heavy or bulky, because some delivery people will drop things off and some won't and you have no way of knowing who is working on what day, because anything that requires the installation of something on a front porch doesn't work when you live in an apartment building, because many of my neighbors have zero access to credit cards/the internet, because because because. When people tell you a paradigm has problems, the answer is not "lol no it doesn't". Sometimes you can trust people to tell you the truth about their lived experiences, I promise. I find the already happening Amazon-ization of stores to be incredibly frustrating-- items that used to be staples in retail stores are now sometimes really hard to find. Sometimes I want to be able to look at an object and feel it in my hands before I buy it, especially since product reliability on Amazon seems to be getting more dicey. In a physical store, I don't have to think "hm, I wonder if this item will reek of gasoline fumes?" before I buy it. I can just smell it and find out. posted by a fiendish thingy at 2:28 PM on April 3 [26 favorites] go ahead and come up with an Amazon competitor for Oreos and see if anybody fucking buys it.

I also live in Seattle. I didn't get it until we had kids and moved to the northern part of town. Good worker policy, cheaper things that we normally buy anyway and $1.50 hot dogs with free drinks. What I do not understand (yet) is buying food online. We've tried Amazon Fresh before. In my head, it's so simple... just click on what you want and you're done. In practice, every time I've used it I've spent wayyy too much time trying to determine if product X is actually what I want, or is a good substitute for product Y (which I really want but isn't available), or just how many peppers I want to buy, or if "3 stars" of produce quality is acceptable, or..... And I don't get any damn samples. Presumably with direct to consumer we'd still be ordering Oreos via some kind of online storefront like Amazon Fresh. Blech. Or perhaps we'd have Dash buttons all over the house? Awful. Or maybe each box of Oreos would have a single-use dash button attached to it? Terrifying. Oh oh I know! You put sensors underneath each cookie and give each box a 4G connection! Then the box can send a message to Nabisco when the number of cookies left in the package gets below the number of people who live in the house! INFINITE AUTO-COOKIES! posted by rouftop at 2:57 PM on April 3 [3 favorites] I've checked other articles, too, and I'm still not clear on what Amazon's proposing to manufacturers. Is it that they want them to use packaging that can flow through the Amazon warehouse and distribution system more efficiently? Or does "time to start shipping products directly to online shoppers " mean that they really want Mondelez, General Mills, and the rest to start drop-shipping directly from their own factory or warehouse directly to the customer? If it's the former, well, ho-hum: Amazon being Amazon. If it's the later it seems like a gutsy step, and maybe one step too far? If I make cereal, and Big AZ wants me to set myself to take orders through them and ship to their customers, why wouldn't I arrange to do the same thing for every other possible web store at the same time, including my own? Amazon can still compete on being big and convenient to shoppers, but If I can buy from several places online and the prices are similar, I'll buy from nearly anyone before Amazon. I don't see why the prices wouldn't be very similar. Most of Amazon's ability to out-price online competitors comes from the ruthless efficiency (and just plain damned ruthlessness) of its logistics operation. If every cookie maker is doing the packing and shipping for them, bypassing their distribution chain, all of that disappears. And it's hard to see how the cookie manufacturer's costs are going to be much different if they're shipping 10000 packages to 10000 amazon customers, or 99980 packages to Amazon customers and 20 to customers of momnpopgroceryonline.com. Amazon can still try to keep lower margins by running the web store more efficiently than everyone else, but surely those costs can't be more than a tiny percentage of what the end-customer pays. AZ surely knows their own business way better than I do, and I'm sure they have other plans to keep customers and manufactures locked into doing business through them. But I, from my ignorant outside vantage, can't see any that look as powerful as their current ability to package and ship for a fraction of the cost of anyone else. Maybe, just maybe, the big dirty river could finally make the misstep that could reverse the centralization of online shopping?

I want to tell you about China. I haven't spent any significant time in the West for quite a while so its hard to say if I am living in the future, or just an alternate timeline, but man this place does it differently. So first off, there is Taobao. I guess it is sort of like Amazon? But it is (almost?) completely made up of independent small vendors, Taobao is just the online platform. Everything is available on Taobao. Stuff you think is unavailable in China is actually just unavailable out in the public shops. Somebody has a bedroom or warehouse full of Russian kolbassa, another guy has size 45 shoes. Real Hellman's Mayonnaise and mustard. Makeup, toilet paper, tampons. The distribution system is incredibly organic. Guys on little tuk-tuk style trike / pickup trucks ferry these little boxes around. Right up to your door, or to the "hives", banks of automated lockers that are rapidly being installed near anywhere that concentrations of people live. When your thing arrives at the hive your phone gets a QR code, which you take to the hive, and you feed it in and the door where your stuff is pops open. The distribution points are everywhere. Corner shops, stretches of sidewalk, a random road underpass. Packages all piled out on the street, in rows and lines, for the right tuktuk guy to take along to the next point. How is it possible? You could just steal this stuff! Well at every point there is a guy in charge, or many guys. And all the stuff is packed in little nondescript cardboard boxes, how would you know what is a laptop and what is 5kg of lard and what is bulk glitter? No percentage in that! And hey, this is China - it isn't that there is no crime here, but for sure the retail level crime is way lower. It could never work in the West... the safety regulations, insurance, liability, but here they just get it done. All the people at every step of the way, shepherding this stuff would I guess cost a fortune even at minimum wage rates. It all happens on your smartphone. If you see something that you like in a real shop, or wherever, you can take a photo of it and Taobao image recognition / matching will find someone online who will sell it to you. I guess retail shopping will be done pretty soon. We do about 50% of even our grocery shopping through Taobao now. All our clothes. They have malls here, but they are filled with luxury branded shops or strange novelty impulse buy type shit... shopping in them seems more an aspirational pass time rather than a practical activity. posted by Meatbomb at 3:37 PM on April 3 [14 favorites] Trader Joe's did it, for Oreos and Cheerios.

I can order stuff that isn't usually stocked in their local store so i assume a lot of it comes from elsewhere. Are Amazon taking about lots of individual deliveries or whole weekly deliveries? posted by biffa at 3:59 PM on April 3 But I, from my ignorant outside vantage, can't see any that look as powerful as their current ability to package and ship for a fraction of the cost of anyone else. No, they pay the same amount for packaging and shipping as everyone else. What they *don't* pay is the overhead involved in maintaining retail locations, that's their big advantage. Because of that, they could set their prices to a lower profit margin than traditional retailers. Until recently they had a second significant advantage in that customers didn't have to pay sales tax to buy online, but they did when buying in a store. However, state laws have evolved over time to start requiring Amazon to pay sales tax, and retailers have come back with price-matching policies, and better distribution that enabled faster shipping. So now Amazon's biggest advantages are being chipped away. They must rely on selection and exclusivity, to be able to say you can get something on Amazon that you can't get somewhere else. That's what the article is all about, courting big brands to only sell on Amazon. But there's nothing really in it for those brands. Why should Cheerios slash the reach of their market and assume all the expense of re-designing their packaging, just to reach 300 million customers? They already reach 300 million customers by changing nothing. To be clear, the overall point in my posts isn't that it's a bad idea to make it easier for people to shop, but that this direction doesn't seem like a good business idea for them. It smacks of Target Canada kind of thinking. posted by Autumnheart at 4:14 PM on April 3 [1 favorite] I'll be worried when they start using CRISPR to engineer chickens that lay unbreakable eggs. posted by GuyZero at 4:47 PM on April 3 So is the idea that these companies would stop selling to big-box stores everywhere, or just in places where Amazon has decent infrastructure in place?

They could just take existing bagged cereal and put it in new mostly-blank boxes, possibly 2-4 bags per box. b) General Mills and their counterparts pay grocery stores big $ to keep their products stocked front and center. Working with Amazon is a major lever in those price negotiations. c) they can go after less price-point-sensitive customers. Suburban families may like getting the best price per ounce on Cheerios but not blink at buying a $20 box. Which General Mills would LOVE. posted by GuyZero at 4:53 PM on April 3 On the other hand, I would enthusiastically nominate Trader Joe's as one of the candidates to "disrupt" Amazon. TJ's is owned by Aldi and the owners are more about having a reliable cash flow rather than innovating in supply chain management. TJs is now a funky off-shoot of a German grocery mega-conglomerate. It stopped being a fun socal local thing a number of years ago. posted by GuyZero at 4:57 PM on April 3 [1 favorite] If I make cereal, and Big AZ wants me to set myself to take orders through them and ship to their customers, why wouldn't I arrange to do the same thing for every other possible web store at the same time, including my own? Ah, I know this one from the back end: because Amazon and that level of retail (but especially Amazon) has basically seamless EDI-to-store integration, and you play by their rules that keep their system running perfectly. If you're a little guy, with a homegrown Shopify or Magento site, they don't offer that kind of integration to the manufacturer. The Fulfillment By Amazon (FBA) system is sleek and powered by search and purchase data that General Mills or whoever just doesn't have access to because Walmart and grocery stores can't read people's minds or shopping lists (yet). Amazon's warehouse system takes the storage and logistics off GM's plate. But for everyone involved to make a profit, the packaging has to change to be more shippable (laundry detergent pods are another great example of shelf-friendly packaging that's a space-waster in shipping boxes), which is what Amazon's trying to convince them to do. (Just like, as the article says, Costco convinced a lot of companies to either package their own bulk-sized offerings when they didn't before, or make them under the cover of the Kirkland brand.) I'm not sure that actually equals "bypass Walmart" as the article says, in the sense of "don't sell product at Walmart" but instead selling an extremely accessible product delivered in a way Walmart can't, packaged to maximize transportability, and probably in the end undercutting Walmart's pricing. I don't think Cheerios are going to become an online-only product anytime soon, but it does mean that fewer people are going to go into Walmart and buy 15 other things because they're about to run out of Cheerios. posted by Lyn Never at 4:57 PM on April 3 The new packaging is only cheaper after paying someone to design it, then reconfiguring all their packaging manufacturers to the new design. That is quite an expensive process. Using Amazon as a price lever only matters if you can demonstrate that they would actually sell enough of your cereal to make up the difference. There's no guarantee people are going to start buying groceries on Amazon en masse, and in fact Amazon has a huge amount of ground to make up on that front if they want to compete effectively. It is kind of a chicken and (unbreakable) egg problem, in that Amazon has to demonstrate competitive sales before brands will jump, and yet they have to have the brands before customers jump. posted by Autumnheart at 4:58 PM on April 3 Also, Target and Walmart absolutely *can* read people's shopping lists (if not minds), because both of those companies also collect and maintain an enormous amount of customer data, and no doubt use it to drive business decisions just like everyone else in retail. And what they don't have, they can buy....especially as of this week. posted by Autumnheart at 5:00 PM on April 3 [1 favorite] The new packaging is only cheaper after paying someone to design it, then reconfiguring all their packaging manufacturers to the new design. That is quite an expensive process. Existing products that offer frustration-free packaging sell way smaller quantities than cereal manufacturers. Redesigning a box is a drop in the bucket if there's real opportunity to sell via Amazon. And they don't have to change the bagging system - it's the same way Costco offers bigger boxes of cereal than your local supermarket, with two interior bags. Amazon could use those right away or go to THREE BAGS. posted by GuyZero at 5:02 PM on April 3 ...if there's real opportunity to sell via Amazon. Right now there isn't. Not in a way that competes with existing retailers. They are competing for the SAME customers. This isn't a new, untapped market we're talking about, after all. And tens of millions of dollars is a lot to spend on fixing something that ain't broke. So where's the win for them? posted by Autumnheart at 5:05 PM on April 3 Weird to see Amazon as the bad guys in grocery when grocery deserts are a thing and have been a thing for a long, long time Not saying Amazon is perfect, but weird to see Amazon positioned as a clearly worse option for poor neighborhoods given that so many of them already suffer from serious issues with food availability. posted by Rock 'em Sock 'em at 5:09 PM on April 3 I mean it's just very werid to see people getting real opinionated about getting groceries to the poor while completely ignoring the current state of things (bad, it is a bad state) posted by Rock 'em Sock 'em at 5:10 PM on April 3 As far as it being a costly swing and likely miss goes, Amazon does seem to have a predilection for ventures in the "If it ain't broke..." category, for some reason. Amazon Prime as a delivery service and streaming video service certainly doesn't make intuitive sense to me, and you hear a lot about how immediately turning a profit is rarely their primary goal. posted by sagc at 5:11 PM on April 3 [1 favorite] You can't ignore the logistics and the business strategy involved in achieving something like this. Government goes through the same shit. You might want to build it, and if you did, they might come, or they might decide not to bother and then you're holding the bag. You need to have a plan for that, and a lot of solid analysis on how to grow it in a way that people will actually use. posted by Autumnheart at 5:13 PM on April 3 Amazon Prime is a loyalty program. It's basically a cross between a membership fee, like Costco, and a points program, like airline miles or credit card points. The execution of it is unique to what Amazon has to offer, but the idea of it isn't new. That sounded sort of mansplainy. I just wanted to tie the overarching concept to the seemingly unrelated things you actually get as a Prime member. posted by Autumnheart at 5:24 PM on April 3 I mean it's just very werid to see people getting real opinionated about getting groceries to the poor while completely ignoring the current state of things (bad, it is a bad state) It is quite bad, but I'm not sure that a system that requires an Internet connection, a credit/debit card, and a way to get packages that's secure is going to make much progress. It would be awesome if poor people had consistent access to those things, but until they do, I suspect this is going to be much more of a way for middle-class people in the suburbs to stock up on bulk goods than for people who live in food deserts to secure daily provisions. That's not an inherently bad thing, but it's occasionally a little frustrating to see a breathless writeup on the audacity of a tech company breaking all the rules when the existing supply chain is brutally inadequate for so many people. posted by Copronymus at 5:57 PM on April 3 [7 favorites] All you need is a smartphone and today Amazon announced that you can deposit cash into your Amazon account at a number of local retailers nationwide like CVS. Secure delivery remains a challenge but the ordering part is not hard at all even for fairly poor people. posted by GuyZero at 6:04 PM on April 3 Gee, just a smartphone and a data plan, that's it? /s Or they could walk into CVS and buy a gallon of milk from CVS. posted by Autumnheart at 6:07 PM on April 3 I work in consumer goods not grocery but there are some things that are outright wrong in this thread I need to clear up. No, they pay the same amount for packaging and shipping as everyone else 100% not true. Shipping rates are always negotiated and volume makes a huge difference. Packaging costs are also volume dependent. Considering how much Amazon ships I doubt the there are any other companies that can touch them on either one of those. The new packaging is only cheaper after paying someone to design it, then reconfiguring all their packaging manufacturers to the new design. That is quite an expensive process. Is there a cost to redesigning packaging? Of course there is, but it is pretty insignificant compared to the potential sales. The company I work for is insignificantly tiny compared to the companies in the article and the cost of creating new packaging isn't worth thinking about except for small promotional runs of a under a couple of thousand. Furthermore, a big cereal company probably gets their box vendor to eat the cost of a new printing die. So why is Amazon doing this? One of their big pushes over the past couple of years is a program called SIOC (ships in own container). Instead of having to pack a box in a shipping box, the item is already in a box suitable for shipping. That means that Amazon saves on the labor of packing the shipping carton as well as some of the packaging costs. This is due to the fact that a color box is much more expensive than a brown corrugate box. posted by nolnacs at 6:12 PM on April 3 [3 favorites] The real question is, how is Amazon going to give me my free cheese samples? posted by kevinbelt at 6:13 PM on April 3 That's what the drones are for. posted by Etrigan at 6:18 PM on April 3 100% not true. Shipping rates are always negotiated and volume makes a huge difference. Packaging costs are also volume dependent. Considering how much Amazon ships I doubt the there are any other companies that can touch them on either one of those. Shipping rates are negotiated per vendor for each batch of inventory. Each of those contracts dictates whether Amazon assumes the cost to ship those items, or the vendor does. Amazon might ship a ton of packages total, but they certainly aren't selling, say, more IPads or Apple Watches than Apple. They are not paying less for shipping those sales than Apple is, or any other retailer for that matter. Secondly, Amazon must ship everything, so even if they're getting a "deal", they're still spending an exorbitant amount on shipping, especially for every customer that buys some physically small, light item and has it arrive in a box far bigger than the product. Is that cost less than what another retailer spends on housing products in a store? Dunno! I imagine there certainly is a point of diminishing return, or they wouldn't be trying to branch out into Amazon Lockers and similar concepts. They would just keep shipping everything. posted by Autumnheart at 6:25 PM on April 3 For those of you who hate Amazon, you're in luck. Amazon is in pretty serious trouble just beneath the surface. The reason they can move and ship goods so cheaply is that they get a massive amount of venture capital; they get a massive amount of venture capital because they are growing rapidly, and have a variety of side businesses that aren't really part of their core retail business that do make money. But this can't possibly continue forever. At some point there's going to be a reckoning and investors will want some kind of profit, Amazon will raise its prices back to sustainable levels, and it will all come crashing down. posted by miyabo at 6:26 PM on April 3 I personally don't hate Amazon (despite working for the competition). But if the lessons learned by my employer came to any conclusion, it's that it is a hell of a lot more sustainable to choose your niche and build on your strengths, than it is to try to be all things to all people. The grocery business in particular is struggling, and that's another reason why I think this particular idea sucks. Amazon does not have infrastructure in place to capture market share. It would take years for them to build it, and for what? To bring back the metaphorical milkman? There's nothing about this idea that improves anything. Hell, even changing the packaging carries a risk, because everyone's house for the last several decades has been built to accommodate packaged foods of a particular size and shape. As I said earlier, maybe AMZN has a roadmap detailing their plans about this, but as of now...it's pie in the sky. (Pie drones.) Now, a few people hit on infrastructure issues that are critical to making something like this work, like secured package drops, rural delivery, a solution for the infirm to get their stuff, etc. etc. So maybe, instead of groceries, Amazon should consider distribution and infrastructure itself. Which still circles back to my original crazy idea of buying the USPS. *heh* posted by Autumnheart at 6:37 PM on April 3 [1 favorite] Shipping rates are negotiated per vendor for each batch of inventory.

Amazon might ship a ton of packages total, but they certainly aren't selling, say, more IPads or Apple Watches than Apple. Yes, it is true that the vendor contract dictates whether Amazon pays for the shipping from the vendor to their distribution centers or whether the vendor does but that was not my point. I am talking about Amazon negotiating with UPS, USPS and the like. Their massive volume of packages - over a million a day - gives them negotiating power the other retailers cannot compete with. posted by nolnacs at 6:47 PM on April 3 ...in terms of paying shipping costs. But other retailers have an advantage in that they don't have to ship everything they sell. In terms of profit margin, Amazon's negotiating power with shipping companies is only part of the equation, just like any other overhead. So it would probably be more accurate for me to say, "Amazon negotiates shipping like everyone else." posted by Autumnheart at 6:54 PM on April 3 For those of you who hate Amazon, you're in luck. Amazon is in pretty serious trouble just beneath the surface. The reason they can move and ship goods so cheaply is that they get a massive amount of venture capital; I know this was true in the early days, but I thought these days Amazon turns whatever profit they would make into an investment into growth. Since the mid-90s they've taken over or created category after category of commerce and services, with what is either the world's luckiest pattern of expansion or a Warren Buffett genius level of resource allocation. They couldn't have done it without essentially free money in the early days, but they survived the dot com bust, paying state sales tax, and challenges from: Google, Wal-Mart, Microsoft, Target, Borders, Barnes and Noble, and god knows how many others. posted by zippy at 6:56 PM on April 3 [2 favorites] They survived those things because Wall Street always said nice things about them, no matter how shitty their business decisions were. I'm being serious. Public perception plays a hyuuuuuuge amount in whether a stock is successful or not. How many times have you heard about Amazon losing a billion dollars because of bad product decisions? Most companies' stock price would tank like Tiananmen Square if they lost a billion dollars on an oops. Not Amazon. (Yes, I am fucking bitter, since I've been on the opposite side of that, where Wall Street thinks you're an asshole no matter how well you do, and the stock reflects it.) posted by Autumnheart at 6:59 PM on April 3 [2 favorites] "If I really wanted to talk crazy, I'd tell Amazon to buy the USPS. Voila. You've got a location in every wide spot in the road in America." I mean it's relatively crazy since USPS is one of the very small handful of things actually mandated by the Constitution. "Gee, just a smartphone and a data plan, that's it? /s" In impoverished areas, people are most likely to have internet services via smartphone and data plan. If you're looking to serve poor areas, you want to make sure your website and services are phone-friendly, since most of your users will be accessing your website via mobile. There are definitely people with no internet access at all, but the bigger digital divide is that people in poor areas have no desktop access and use the internet solely on mobile. posted by Eyebrows McGee at 7:00 PM on April 3 [4 favorites] Walmart has a serious leg-up in this race. They have an extensive warehouse and distribution chain all over the nation. It's how they supply their stores. For the past year Walmart has been implementing Grocery Pickup. Logon to the site and over several days put together an order, just you or with others. My wife and I build our order together on different computers. What you see on the screen is the current, up to date inventory of your local Walmart. Set a time, show up, give them a call on your cell and the whole order is loaded into your trunk. Over $30 and the service is free. This will be hard to beat by the remote control guys... posted by jim in austin at 7:01 PM on April 3 [3 favorites] I mean it's relatively crazy since USPS is one of the very small handful of things actually mandated by the Constitution. But it is a corporation now, as opposed to a government institution. And so's the military (mandated by the Constitution), but that didn't stop Boeing and Lockheed Martin. In my imagination, I picture this as Amazon buying the USPS but not rebranding it--the value would be in the property and the customer data, of course. Once they owned those things, they could expand existing service to offer things like Amazon Lockers and secured drops and whatever they wanted. They'd be contracted like a defense contractor. Again, just looking at this from a business perspective, not from an altruistic progressive kind of perspective. (It'd be nice if those were the same goals, but hey, this is America.) posted by Autumnheart at 7:05 PM on April 3 In impoverished areas, people are most likely to have internet services via smartphone and data plan. Yes, but forcing them to pay for communication to feed themselves is not, in my opinion, an advancement. Walmart has a serious leg-up in this race. They have an extensive warehouse and distribution chain all over the nation. They sure as hell do. Walmart has the best logistics on the planet (along with UPS, arguably). For that matter, Best Buy made huge strides by implementing "ship to store" and "ship from store", where, when you order something online, they ship it from the nearest location, be it a distribution center or a store. So people might very well get it within 1-2 days even without paying for next-day shipping. Or they can just go pick it up. Obviously, that's what Amazon Lockers are striving to compete against, but like you said...there's a lot of ground to make up. posted by Autumnheart at 7:06 PM on April 3 Trader Joe's did it, for Oreos and Cheerios. If I could order Trader Joes via Amazon Fresh, I would be a happy person. This will be hard to beat by the remote control guys... Amazon Fresh and competing grocery delivery services beat that, since you don't have to drive somewhere, make a call, and carry the bags home. It's a long way from great, and I'm not going to give up my Costco card anytime soon, but it works well for a certain set of staples. posted by Dip Flash at 7:25 PM on April 3 they get a massive amount of venture capital because they are growing rapidly Amazon had its IPO nearly 20 years ago to the day, May 15, 1997. They haven't received venture capital probably since 1995 at the latest. and have a variety of side businesses that aren't really part of their core retail business that do make money. Running low margins is not the same as cross-subsidizing lines of business. But this can't possibly continue forever. It can continue indefinitely as long as they're content not turning a profit on their retail sales business, which may very well be a long time. posted by GuyZero at 7:37 PM on April 3 [1 favorite] It really can't, because shareholders don't like it when you insist on running operations that drain money from profitable revenue streams. Amazon hasn't been a private company in a very long time. They've been allowed to operate like one, far longer than most companies have been given that leeway, but it's not just their money that they lose. Their investors are finally starting to demand accountability, and if Amazon can't get in the habit of being accountable, then that will spell trouble for their future. posted by Autumnheart at 7:44 PM on April 3 [1 favorite] It really can't Sure it can. It can until it can't. This is a 20 year-old company which is basically unprofitable in their main line of business whose total one-year return on their stock is 48%. Their total return over a decade is 36%. There are amazingly profitable companies that are much less popular with investors. Until Amazon has some real competition they're likely to run near breakeven and the stock market will reward them for it. I guess investors could all change their mind tomorrow and liquidate their holdings and the stock would collapse. 20 years of data says that's unlikely to happen. But yeah, past performance is not a predictor of future results. Also, note that the lack of profitability isn't a bad thing - they're taking some hidden amount of profit and reinvesting it in their business. This is part of why investors love them - they take their growth and use it to fuel more growth. The likely end of Amazon's growth is when they own the majority of the US retail sector. posted by GuyZero at 7:55 PM on April 3 [1 favorite] Investors are giving them money to invest in AWS (which makes a massive profit and has potential to replace companies like IBM and HPE that are worth hundreds of billions of dollars). Amazon turns around and uses that money to subsidize shipping toilet paper UPS to Omaha. Eventually the investors are going to notice that there's this stupidly inefficient retail business attached to their IT juggernaut, and get rid of it. posted by miyabo at 8:03 PM on April 3 [2 favorites] Have you even read Amazon's financial statements? Investors are giving them money to invest in AWS Investors don't give Amazon any money, not since the IPO. When Amazon stock is traded it's handed between two inventors, Amazon doesn't get any of that money. To quote their 10K: We believe that cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, as well as borrowing available under our credit agreements, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next 12 months. They don't sell equities. I don't know if they've done any followon offerings after their 1997 IPO but for the most part they get their cash from operations. As for AWS subsidizing their retail business, their North American retail sales in 2015 were $63.7B and their total sales from AWS were $7.8B. AWS is 7% of their business, retail worldwide is 93%. I agree that AWS is a source of huge growth and is likely much more profitable than retail sales, but retail is big. Really, really big. posted by GuyZero at 8:14 PM on April 3 Also: Eventually the investors are going to notice that there's this stupidly inefficient retail business attached to their IT juggernaut, and get rid of it. I don't think investors want Amazon to dump a $99B business for a $8B business. They do run a low margins in retail, but it's still a huge top-line business. 2015 operating income for retail was $2.66B and the profile for AWS was $1.8B so clearly AWS is better but it'll be a long time before AWS is doing 13x its current level of sales. Well, maybe not that long, at the current 70% y/y growth that amazon reports for AWS that's like 14 years which is a lifetime in technology so it remains to be seen whether that level of growth is sustainable. And retail is currently growing at 25% and I'm too lazy to figure out when those growth curves cross over but it's not like their retail segment isn't growing. posted by GuyZero at 8:22 PM on April 3 And a finally also: Amazon's 1997 IPO generated something like $55M which was a lot of money then but is a pretty laughable amount of money by modern IPO standards. Even adjusted for inflation it's like $86M. The billions they have in the bank come from operational cash flow. posted by GuyZero at 8:27 PM on April 3 [1 favorite] "But it is a corporation now, as opposed to a government institution." I feel like you're confused. It's an independent federal agency. It's still a government institution. And, either way, it's still in the Constitution. posted by Eyebrows McGee at 8:52 PM on April 3 [Friendly reminder, please don't use the edit function to add or change content. Just make a second comment instead.] posted by LobsterMitten at 8:59 PM on April 3 People above have already talked about amazon's shit labor practices and why their style of grocery delivery isn't viable in many poor neighborhoods. That said, food deserts are a real thing, lugging tons of groceries without a car is a pain for small things and impossible for larger ones. As a carless city person I get the impulse to be defensive here, and I confess to buying the occasional amazon thing. I don't have to get groceries off amazon though, because the local store that opened near me a few months ago did something I've never seen before. They started offering a free shuttle for part of the day to everyone who buys over fifty dollars worth of groceries and lives within a two mile radius of the store. This is life changing for me in so many ways. I can get as much food as I need without wondering how to haul it home. The driver lives in my neighborhood, remembers my address, and helps me get the bags into my front door. I waste so much less mental bandwidth on the logistics of shopping. It's worth noting that I live in the more gentrified area of the driver's radius. The store itself is in a more marginalized neighborhood, and is the only big grocery retailer for a few miles around; I bet the shuttle's even more valuable for people who live closer by. You could make the case that the shuttle's limited hours aren't the most useful for people with erratic work schedules. You could argue that fifty dollars is prohibitively expensive for some shoppers. All valid complaints, but that would be letting the perfect be the enemy of the really-helpful-for-many. I'm sure that my store isn't the only neighborhood grocery place with an innovative approach to getting groceries to people who might otherwise have trouble getting them. If amazon tries to get exclusive access to some goods, I worry that local places like mine that have put a lot of thought into how to best serve their local marginalized communities will get shut out. posted by ActionPopulated at 10:27 PM on April 3 [4 favorites] « Older Murderous Sleepwalker   |   “There are no missing objects.

Tech Apple Science Cars Samsung Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 Nintendo NES     Target Sells Nintendo Switch Bundle Online Posted: Apr 3 2017, 11:37am CDT | by Luigi Lugmayr, Updated: Apr 3 2017, 10:14pm CDT, in News | Technology News     A $499.99 Nintendo Switch Bundle is in stock at target.com. Nintendo announced last week that more Nintendo Switch consoles are on the way. The Mario company told the truth. Lots of new Switch inventory has been showing up over the past days. The crazy demand makes it though difficult to score a Switch for the regular retail price of $299.99. We have released a new comprehensive Nintendo Switch Shopping Guide with all the tips and tricks to find and buy a Nintendo Switch. Don't Miss: The hottest Apple Rumors for 2017 Target just started to offer a Switch bundle online at target.com. The $499.99 Switch Starter bundle includes Nintendo Switch with Gray Joy-Con, Nintendo Switch Pro Controller, Nintendo Switch Game Traveler Deluxe Travel Case, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild for Nintendo Switch, 1-2 Switch for Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Link (Rider): Breath of the Wild amiibo Figure. This Switch bundle includes items that most gamers would anyway get. Find this bundle now on target.com.  The stand alone Switch consoles are only available at Target stores. We have seen few notifications of Switch stock for Target stores on iStockNow this morning. The reseller prices of the Nintendo Switch stay around $400, despite the restocking. Please avoid the fake low priced reseller deals on the Nintendo Switch. These offers are a scam. Read our report on the Nintendo Switch Amazon scam for details. Nintendo started to restock the Nintendo Switch two weeks. GameStop kicked things off with restocking the Switch in stores. Walmart, Target, ToysRUs and even amazon.com offered the $299.99 Nintendo Switch with Grey Joy-Con. The supply for the Nintendo Switch Neon Joy-Con version was much lower. The Nintendo flagship store in New York sold Nintendo Switch each day last week. Read our Nintendo Switch Shopping Guide to find a Switch in stock. The new Nintendo Switch launched on March 3 and as expected, it sold out on launch day. Nintendo's comments that there would be enough Switch consoles in March to satisfy demand turned out to be untrue. Nintendo now plans to double the production of the Nintendo Switch. The company plans to make 16 million Switch consoles starting April 1 until March 2018. The original plan was to produce 8 million Switch consoles. The colorful Switch is slightly harder to find than the console with gray controllers. The premium resellers charge is with 50 to 65% still much lower than it is the case for the Nintendo NES Classic. Nintendo is expected to ship 2 million Switch consoles in March for the global market. The number is too low and finding Nintendo Switch in stock after the initial launch batch sells out is very difficult. The Switch gave Nintendo their biggest console launch ever. The first 2-days of sales beat the Wii and all other Nintendo consoles. The $59.99 NES Classic continues to be also in extreme short supply and Nintendo is unable to ship a significant resupply to resellers in weeks. Nintendo sold through 1.5 million NES Classic consoles and the demand is by far not satisfied. It might take Nintendo until Fall to make enough Switch consoles to satisfy demand. The Switch will be one of the most popular Holiday gifts for the Holiday shopping season 2017.  For video game fans who have not pre-ordered a Switch yet, there are still chances on launch day. There have been midnight launches for the Nintendo Switch at several retailers. The online availability of the Switch is expected to be very limited on launch day. The Nintendo Switch is a completely new video game concept. It's a mobile console first with removable small controllers. The mobile unit with display rest in a Nintendo Switch console connected to your TV. The mobile unit slides inside the Switch docking station, where it also gets charged. The small controllers that are detachable from the mobile unit also slide onto a home controller. A new Zelda game will be amongst the launch titles for the new Nintendo Switch, formerly known as Nintendo NX. The Nintendo Switch games sell for $59.99 like the games for the PS4 and Xbox One. The announced Nintendo Switch game line-up includes Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Nintendo killed region locking on the Nintendo Switch. Any game sold in any region will be playable on the Nintendo Switch. The system will include the main console, Joy-Con (L) and Joy-Con (R) controllers, a Joy-Con grip (to which two Joy-Con are attached and used as one controller), a set of Joy-Con wrist straps, a Nintendo Switch dock (which holds the main console and connects it to a TV), an HDMI cable and an AC adapter. Two stylish versions of the system will be released: a version with a set of gray Joy-Con, and a version with one neon blue and one neon red Joy-Con. Both versions will be the same price.

View FAQ or Contact Us close [x] Share: Facebook Twitter Google+ Share LinkedIn Email (iStock) Axess Law is rolling out a service that gives customers a chance to create a simple will for $99 at select Walmart outposts. But is it really a good idea to create a document determining who will get your worldly goods while Big Box shopping for jumbo paper towels and flip flops? One advantage of Axess’s service is you can get a will made in the evenings or weekends. And when you consider that 56% of Canadians don’t even have a signed will, “anything that helps people help themselves is probably a good idea,” says Allan Hutchinson of York University’s Osgoode Hall Law School. There are also big savings, as simple wills at conventional law firms run between $500 and $1,000.       Play: Stefania Di Verdi talks wills with 680 News’ Mike Eppel But how do you know if yours is a simple will? Generally speaking, if you plan to pass your wealth on to your spouse followed by your kids, chances are your needs are basic. “A complex will is when clients want to set up complicated trusts for beneficiaries or when they have assets all over the world,” says Axess Law’s Lena Koke.

Reply ↓ Jihn on July 7, 2014 at 11:31 am Lawyers who practice Wills and Estates provide a service of understanding your assets, your needs, and determining far more than “everything to spouse”. Making the public think that only the wealthy need law firms and “complex” wills, is no public service. Walmart is banking on volume of a cheap product. A Walmart will is better than nothing, but I suggest that one of the most important documents you will ever sign should not be drafted while you shop for an hour. Reply ↓ Amy MacAlpine on October 17, 2014 at 10:02 pm This was my worst experience ever! The only time I got a timely reply from the lawyer/owner was the first time when he was trying to recruit business. Everything after was a mess. We met at the Richmond Hill office a few days prior to closing and there was no privacy at all. We waited for 45 minutes because the documents were not ready. There was another lawyer at the office and he didn’t even bother to greet us. After the clerk did the paper work he just stamped. Then they messed up with the date of closing and they blamed on the fax being unclear. On the day of closing they had no idea when the key to the apartment was. They said they would call me about the key and I had never heard from them after. I had to make so many phone calls and finally I got the key from the builder 3 days after closing. Terrible service. Will not recommend Axess to anyone. Painful! Reply ↓ Gilbert Wu on January 13, 2017 at 5:50 pm In Ontario,and many part of the World, but not everywhere, you can write your own Will. It has to be neat, legible, and every word has to be in your own HANDWRITING. You specify who you are, the DATE when you are writing the Will, and as of this date you are of SOUND MIND, and totally capable of running your own affairs. Then appoint an EXECUTOR, and intsruct him to look after your funeral, pay your taxes and other obligation,and after that ,distribute your posssessions to the persons and organisations you describe in your Will. Be precise in describing the beneficieries. Exemple: To my friend Joe Doe, brick layer, his date of birth, his mother,s name and his address, the some of TEN THOUSAND ($10,000.00 ) Dollars. or Good Heart Charity of Toronto Five Thousand ($ 5,000.00) Dollars.. Don’t give – one third, or 10 per cent, – because Good Heart may want to see your tax return for the past five years to figure out how much is one third of your estate. They couldn’t dispute how much is 5000.- Dollars. Sign your dated will in your custumary SIGNATUE, and NO Witness! That’it. And don’t let anybody tell you that it is not legal. Put it in an envelope, tell your Executor where it is. You could also tell a few friends that you made a will. HOLOGRAPHIC WILL it’s called.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 3 April 2017 by Military News Mobile Industrial Robots Launches New MiR200 More Powerful Autonomous Mobile Robot that Supports Easier Programming and Flexible Deployment for Faster ROI CHICAGO & ODENSE, Denmark–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Mobile Industrial Robots, (MiR), a next-generation developer and manufacturer of autonomous mobile robots (AMRs), is launching its newest robot, the MiR200, at Automate 2017 in Chicago today. The MiR200 is a more powerful mobile robot in almost every aspect than the company’s flagship MiR100, which has already been installed in more than 30 countries by companies such as Airbus, Boeing, Flex, Honeywell, Michelin, Procter & Gamble, Toyota and Walmart. MiR’s industry-leading AMRs are a dramatic improvement over legacy automated guided vehicles (AGVs), which require the expensive and inflexible installation of sensors or magnets into factory floors for guidance. MiR products are designed to give owners the flexibility to easily redeploy the robots to different processes or facility layouts to support changing business needs and agile manufacturing processes. With the launch of the MiR200, customers now have even more choices in how to effectively, quickly and cost-effectively automate their material transportation needs. “Our robots are changing the game for any size business, from small, regional companies to large multinationals,” said MiR CEO Thomas Visti. “With the new interface of the MiR200, it’s even easier for companies to program the robot themselves and adapt its deployment as their business evolves. That’s critical for their competitiveness, and supports extremely fast ROI. The robot typically pays for itself in less than a year, even in very dynamic environments.” MiR200 offers game-changing user interface, performance and ROI The MiR200 updates MiR’s already-intuitive web-based user interface, making programming even easier for users who have no previous experience and allowing for even more optimized implementation. Updates include customizable dashboards, improved mapping, easier creation of robot missions and tasks, multi-level permissions, responsive web design and comprehensive browser support. Integrated help and product documentation provides additional guidance. The powerful MiR200 doubles the payload capacity of the MiR100 to 200kg/440lbs, and offers a MiRHook option for autonomous towing of carts up to 500kg/1102lbs. The robot offers exceptional flexibility for top modules—including racks, shelves, conveyors, lifts or even collaborative robot arms—which can be easily customized and mounted to meet specific application requirements. With its ESD-compliant exterior, the MiR200 is ideal for electronic assembly applications where parts being transported must be protected from electrostatic discharge. MiR robots offer more high-performance sensor technologies than any other mobile robot on the market. Six separate sensor systems feed data to the robot’s real-time navigation and safety algorithms. This enables quick decisions for highly efficient and safe operation of the robot, even in changing situations where people, extension cords, pallets or boxes can create unpredictable obstacles. Full 360-degree scanning allows the robot to safely back up, rather than being limited to forward motion. Additional sensors prevent blindspots by identifying obstacles above the robot, such as a table, and can look ahead and down to identify holes or stairwells, as well as clear obstacles such as glass walls. Visit MiR at Automate 2017, Booth #1468 to see the MiR200 in action, along with the rest of the MiR product line. Additional photos can be downloaded here: http://www.mobile-industrial-robots.com/about-us/marketing Additional information is available here: http://www.mobile-industrial-robots.com/products/mir200 About MiR Mobile Industrial Robots is headquartered in Odense, Denmark where the company was founded in 2013 by experienced professionals from the Danish robotics industry. MiR develops and sells the most advanced mobile robots for internal transportation of goods in both the manufacturing and health care industries. MiR has quickly established a global distribution network in more than 30 countries, and the company has grown rapidly with a 500 percent increase in sales from 2015 to 2016. The company recently set up regional offices in Shanghai and New York. MiR supplies its collaborative, safe and autonomous robots to multinational industrial groups and mid-sized companies. MiR robots carry out internal transportation tasks quickly, easily and cost-effectively, to free employees for more valuable activities. Hundreds of manufacturers worldwide, as well as hospitals and care facilities, already use MiR’s innovative robots.

More Comments Tumblr Pinterest Reddit Digg FarkIt StumbleUpon Inside every iPhone and iPad are dozens of small components made by suppliers whose businesses are tied to Apple Inc. As Imagination Technologies Group Plc has now learned, it’s lucrative to be a favourite Apple supplier — until you’re not. Apple notified Imagination that it will no longer be using the British company’s graphics technology within the next two years. The news Monday sent Imagination’s shares down as much as 72 per cent. Apple is Imagination’s largest customer, providing just over half its revenue. Just as a household product’s success can be determined by Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the fate of component suppliers around the world are often based on the product decisions of Apple engineers and executives. With about 211.9 million iPhones sold last year, Apple’s scale gives it considerable leverage over suppliers. Sixteen companies receive at least half their revenue from Apple, including Cirrus Logic Inc and Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Related Apple Inc unveils new iPad with lowest price ever, red iPhone 7 and new social app Clips After acquiring several firms and new talent, Apple Inc may be looking to bring augmented reality to the masses Imagination has long been one of Apple’s closest suppliers. Its graphics technology has been inside every iPhone and iPad released, allowing for things such as playing games. In 2008, Apple began building what’s now an 8 per cent stake in Imagination.  The partnership has been a financial boon for the chip supplier, whose revenue has more than tripled since the iPhone was first released in 2007. Imagination even has an office near Apple’s headquarters in Cupertino, California, so its engineers can work more closely with Apple. The two companies held talks last year about combining, but a deal the didn’t come together. Apple has recently hired several people from Imagination, including former chief operating officer John Metcalfe as a senior director based in London. Now Imagination says Apple plans to make the graphics technology on its own. The U.K. company said it was negotiating with Apple, but Imagination’s stock still collapsed. Neil Campling, head of technology research at Northern Trust Securities, said Imagination is now “uninvestable.” Roger Phillips, an analyst at Investec Ltd., said it was Imagination’s “biggest risk realized.” The news spooked investors of other Apple suppliers. Dialog Semiconductor Plc., a U.K.-based chipmaker that gets about 69 per cent of its sales from Apple, fell as much as 4.4 per cent Monday, the most since December, according to data from Bloomberg. Apple has a history of being touchy with suppliers. In one current spat, Apple has sued chip supplier Qualcomm Inc. over the royalty it pays for cellular technologies used in modems for the iPhone and iPad. Apple and Samsung Electronics Co., which is a supplier for Apple in addition to being its biggest competitor, were entangled in patent lawsuits for years.  Other suppliers such as touch-screen maker TPK Holdings and audio-component maker Audience have also seen their stocks whipsaw based on orders from Apple. GT Advanced Technologies, which Apple hired to make a new kind of screen glass, filed for bankruptcy after Apple abandoned the project. “It is both a boon and a bane to have Apple as a customer,” said Neil Shah, research director at Counterpoint Technology Market Research.

Cops Report 'Possible' Sighting of Duo Inside Edition April 3, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation (TBI) said images posted by Nebraska police of a "possible" sighting of the missing 15-year-old Tennessee teen and her teacher are not the pair. The people in the sighting, which was captured on surveillance video at a McDonald’s Sunday night, looked similar to the duo, who have not been seen for three weeks. Read: Teacher, Missing Student Spotted in Out-of-State Walmart Days After Disappearing The Kearney Police Department in Nebraska posted images of the people they said were possibly Elizabeth Thomas, 15, and Tad Cummins, 50, inside an area McDonald’s, along with images of the two released by Tennessee police last month. In the Facebook post, they added: “They were possibly driving the pickup in the attached photos. They could also still be using the Silver 2015 Nissan Rogue listed in the Amber Alert. Call 911 if you observe either of these vehicles or Elizabeth Thomas or Tad Cummins. Use caution as the suspect has possession of two handguns.” The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation (TBI) have called the McDonald's sighting unconfirmed, saying they can't be certain the people in the footage are Thomas and Cummins. Read: Teacher Researched Teen Marriage Online Before Kidnapping 15-Year-Old Student: Investigators The images of the possible sighting in Nebraska came just several days after the TBI released surveillance images of the duo inside an Oklahoma City Walmart on Friday. The images were taken on March 15, two days after Thomas was allegedly abducted by the teacher in Columbia, Tenn.

Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger Leading brands are boycotting advertising services on Google’s YouTube after their ads were placed alongside content they deemed inappropriate and – even worse – were charged for the privilege. The long list includes household names such as Starbucks, Pepsi, Walmart, Tesco, the BBC and the UK government. Some have even suggested that they may have inadvertently sponsored extremist and hateful groups to the tune of more than £250,000. To understand how, it’s helpful to recall how Google services such as YouTube work. When we watch a video clip we may see ads and we often skip them. But for Google the ad is the important thing – something like 90% of its revenue comes from selling ads. When an ad is placed around a YouTube video, Google charges the advertiser and shares some of the revenue with the user who posted the video. Vloggers such as Zoella make a pretty penny from this. Google’s targeting technologies can allow advertisers to place their ads around specific types of videos or present them to specific groups of viewers. So what’s the problem? Surely it is acceptable for brands to choose which content they sponsor? Isn’t this what happens on traditional media? Given that brands can target their ads already perhaps something else is going on. Over the firewall Brands certainly have the right to demand which content their ads appear alongside. On traditional media, a brand might not want its ads placed alongside a report about a terror campaign, for example. But it is not considered acceptable for them to say that the newspaper shouldn’t report such events at all. To get around this, traditional media companies separate news and information operations from advertising operations. The problem with services like Google and other social media platforms is that such organisational firewalls don’t exist. As a result, there are potential hidden biases that can come about when advertisers insist that content matches their “company values”. Ironically enough, this problem is spelled out pretty well in a 1998 paper by Google’s founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page. They wrote that the “goals of the advertising business model do not always correspond to providing quality search to users”. The example they cited from a prototype version of Google saw a search for mobile phones pull up a study which went into detail about the risks of speaking on a phone while driving. They concluded that a search engine company which was taking money for mobile phone ads would struggle to justify that kind of search result to paying advertisers. Brin and Page concluded that: Advertising funded search engines will be inherently biased towards the advertisers and away from the needs of the consumers. That belief underpins why Google search separates out advertising sponsored links from organic search results. On YouTube, however, responsibility for the content of videos and the placement of ads is delegated onto viewers, users and brands through its terms of service and advertising policies. Indeed, from my analysis of 45 published cases by the UK’s Advertising Standards Authority that involved YouTube, there were 44 in which YouTube responded that users, viewers and brands were responsible for the ads people saw on the service – not them. In just a single case, did YouTube accept that an ad should be taken down following a complaint to the ASA. So, one way of looking at the current boycott is that’s it’s a case of brands pushing responsibility for content and placement back onto Google/YouTube who, up to now, have been very successful in passing this responsibility onto brands and user. Weeding There is another way of looking at it, and that is as an indirect way for brands to claim more power over the type of content that people can share online. If Google has to “weed out extremist views” (as politicians such as Yvette Cooper have requested), it has to define what is extremist. Sergey Brin and Larry Page pictured in 2004. EPA/Boris Roessler The problem here is that Google’s approach to consulting with other institutions about how it operates is often spiky – as their engagement with the ASA illustrates. If they only listen to what brands want, it leaves them very susceptible to the types of insidious biases that Brin and Page spoke about in their 1998 paper: see its definition of “advertiser-friendly content”. Might they start to direct viewers towards advertising-friendly content? They could, for example, push other content down their search results and recommended video lists. So what does Google do next in the stand off with the big brands? Chief Business Officer Philip Schindler told Bloomberg that the firm has improved its ability to flag offending videos and immediately disable ads. He also revealed that giant health products firm, Johnson & Johnson, has rolled back its boycott in some major markets. More broadly though, the solution is for Google to be far more transparent and engaged in the societies in which it operates. It needs to respond to brands and consumers but other social institutions as well. We all have to decide what is acceptable, not an algorithm, brands, politicians or individual YouTube viewers.

Of those tips, more than 300 still are being probed by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation today, said public information officer Susan Niland. Cummins, a 50-year-old ex-teacher, is accused of kidnapping 15-year-old Thomas, who was his student at Culleoka Unit School in Maury County, Tennessee. Cummins is wanted for having sexual contact with Thomas. The two have been missing since March 13, with Amber Alerts still active in Alabama and Tennessee. The last confirmed sighting was two days later at a Wal-Mart store near Interstate 240 in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. The sighting wasn't confirmed until this past week, when TBI was notified about photos and video captured on surveillance equipment at the store. The video and images showed their appearances had been altered, including darkening Cummins' hair and changing Thomas' hair color to red. It's not clear whether Cummins may still be driving a silver Nissan Rogue with Tennessee license place 976-ZPT. Cummins' wife, Jill, who has publicly encouraged her husband to surrender, filed for divorce Friday, citing irreconcilable differences that have arisen in the marriage. Cummins was fired by the school system the day after the abduction, although as far back as January he reportedly was caught kissing Thomas in his classroom. Read more about how the school system handled the situation here. Authorities have said Cummins groomed and lured Thomas before the kidnapping. A former student of Cummins told Inside Edition in an interview that aired this past week that the ex-teacher wrote a love song for her years ago. Although Destany Parrish says nothing inappropriate ever happened, the two were close when she was his student. Parrish shared audio footage with Inside Edition that she claims features Cummins singing the song to her in the school's music room. Authorities are encouraging the public to share information about the Amber Alert with anyone they know south of the U.S. border. While investigators don't have any information placing Thomas and Cummins in Mexico, they say it's possible the two have made it that far. Mexican police have been notified about the case. The public is asked to be on the lookout, particularly in rural or secluded areas. Hunters are asked to watch for Cummins and Thomas. Investigators are asking people to be vigilant in parking garages and lots, parks, campgrounds and other off-the-grid places. Prior to the sighting in Oklahoma, Thomas' last known location was Columbia, Tennessee when a friend dropped her off at a Shoney's restaurant March 13. Cummins was seen filling up with gas at a nearby gas station. The bureau placed Cummins in Decatur, Alabama later that day. Thomas is a white female possibly with red, strawberry or blonde hair and hazel eyes. She is 5 feet and weighs about 120 pounds. Cummins, believed to be armed with multiple guns, is a white male possibly with dark hair and brown eyes. He is six feet and about 200 pounds. Anyone with information is asked to call 1-800-TBI-FIND. Anyone who sees Cummins, Thomas or the vehicle should call 911. Must-see concerts in Alabama this year ...

Kids Love It! Cavities Don’t.

With its bubble gum and fruit punch flavors, 4 out of 5 parents say ACT Kids Toothpaste motivates their kids to brush their teeth.1 “We are excited to introduce our first children’s toothpaste into the portfolio of oral care products that ACT currently offers,” said Jennifer Cooper, Associate Director – Oral Care, Sanofi Consumer Health Care. “Our hope is that this new product will help motivate kids to brush and inspire parents to further instill healthy oral care habits at an early age.” A recent survey found more than half of moms (56%) struggle with getting their kids to brush their teeth, illustrating the need for new oral care products that make this daily battle easier. Additional findings from the recent survey of moms include the following:* A majority of moms (73%) say they wish their kids were motivated to brush their teeth instead of seeing it as a chore Nearly 4 in 10 moms (35%) say getting their kids to brush their teeth is one of their most frustrating daily battles, in line with convincing them to eat their vegetables (38%) and putting them to bed at night (40%) More than half of moms (52%) say they would give up their “me time” for a month if it meant they never had to battle with their kids again to get them to brush their teeth “Getting children to brush their teeth well and often can be a challenging battle for parents but it is incredibly important for the prevention of cavities,” said Paul H. Carico, III, DDS with Chattanooga Center for Comprehensive Dentistry. “With flavors kids enjoy and the power of fluoride, which safely strengthens teeth and prevents tooth decay, parents can trust ACT Kids Toothpaste as a new option to help their children maintain a clean, strong smile.” ACT Kids Toothpaste is rolling out to a variety of retail locations in March-April 2017, including select Walmart, Walgreens, and Target locations. In addition to the toothpaste, the ACT Kids line includes anticavity rinses that can be used after brushing by kids 6 years of age and older for the optimal oral care routine. For more information, visit ACTOralCare.com/ACT-for-Kids. If further assistance is needed, please email consumer.affairs@chattem.com. *This survey was conducted online using Toluna’s QuickSurveys methodology between February 13, 2017 and February 14, 2017 among 1,150 moms in the USA with children between the ages of two and 12. Respondents for Toluna QuickSurveys are selected from among those who have agreed to participate in Toluna surveys. Toluna’s SmartSelect™ methodology was used to promote sample representativeness. SmartSelect relies on statistical matching rather than probability sampling to select survey respondents, based on demographic, attitudinal and behavioral characteristics that match those of the target population. Figures for age, gender, region, race/ethnicity, education and income are also weighted to bring them into line with their actual proportions within the population. Because the sample is based on those who agreed to participate in Toluna surveys, no estimates of theoretical sampling error can be calculated. About ACT A trusted leader in mouthwashes for over 30 years, ACT® offers a broad line of products, including some of the fastest-growing and top-selling mouthwashes, fluoride rinses, lozenges and toothpastes in America. ACT® Kids products are specially designed to protect and strengthen kids’ developing teeth, including new ACT® Kids Toothpaste and a variety of anticavity mouthwashes.

Additional findings from the recent survey of moms include the following:* A majority of moms (73%) say they wish their kids were motivated to brush their teeth instead of seeing it as a chore Nearly 4 in 10 moms (35%) say getting their kids to brush their teeth is one of their most frustrating daily battles, in line with convincing them to eat their vegetables (38%) and putting them to bed at night (40%) More than half of moms (52%) say they would give up their “me time” for a month if it meant they never had to battle with their kids again to get them to brush their teeth “Getting children to brush their teeth well and often can be a challenging battle for parents but it is incredibly important for the prevention of cavities,” said Paul H. Carico, III, DDS with Chattanooga Center for Comprehensive Dentistry. “With flavors kids enjoy and the power of fluoride, which safely strengthens teeth and prevents tooth decay, parents can trust ACT Kids Toothpaste as a new option to help their children maintain a clean, strong smile.” ACT Kids Toothpaste is rolling out to a variety of retail locations in March-April 2017, including select Walmart, Walgreens, and Target locations.

Respondents for Toluna QuickSurveys are selected from among those who have agreed to participate in Toluna surveys. Toluna’s SmartSelect™ methodology was used to promote sample representativeness. SmartSelect relies on statistical matching rather than probability sampling to select survey respondents, based on demographic, attitudinal and behavioral characteristics that match those of the target population. Figures for age, gender, region, race/ethnicity, education and income are also weighted to bring them into line with their actual proportions within the population. Because the sample is based on those who agreed to participate in Toluna surveys, no estimates of theoretical sampling error can be calculated.

As Imagination Technologies Group Plc has now learned, it’s lucrative to be a favorite Apple supplier -- until you’re not. Apple notified Imagination that it will no longer be using the British company’s graphics technology within the next two years. The news Monday sent Imagination’s shares down as much as 72 percent. Apple is Imagination’s largest customer, providing just over half its revenue. Exclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology. Sign Up Just as a household product’s success can be determined by Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the fate of component suppliers around the world are often based on the product decisions of Apple engineers and executives. With about 211.9 million iPhones sold last year, Apple’s scale gives it considerable leverage over suppliers. Sixteen companies receive at least half their revenue from Apple, including Cirrus Logic Inc and Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Imagination has long been one of Apple’s closest suppliers. Its graphics technology has been inside every iPhone and iPad released, allowing for things such as playing games. In 2008, Apple began building what’s now an 8 percent stake in Imagination.  The partnership has been a financial boon for the chip supplier, whose revenue has more than tripled since the iPhone was first released in 2007. Imagination even has an office near Apple’s headquarters in Cupertino, California, so its engineers can work more closely with Apple. The two companies held talks last year about combining, but a deal the didn’t come together. Apple has recently hired several people from Imagination, including former chief operating officer John Metcalfe as a senior director based in London. Now Imagination says Apple plans to make the graphics technology on its own. The U.K. company said it was negotiating with Apple, but Imagination’s stock still collapsed. Neil Campling, head of technology research at Northern Trust Securities, said Imagination is now "uninvestable." Roger Phillips, an analyst at Investec Ltd., said it was Imagination’s "biggest risk realized." The news spooked investors of other Apple suppliers. Dialog Semiconductor Plc., a U.K.-based chipmaker that gets about 69 percent of its sales from Apple, fell as much as 4.4 percent Monday, the most since December, according to data from Bloomberg. Apple has a history of being touchy with suppliers. In one current spat, Apple has sued chip supplier Qualcomm Inc. over the royalty it pays for cellular technologies used in modems for the iPhone and iPad. Apple and Samsung Electronics Co., which is a supplier for Apple in addition to being its biggest competitor, were entangled in patent lawsuits for years.  Other suppliers such as touch-screen maker TPK Holdings and audio-component maker Audience have also seen their stocks whipsaw based on orders from Apple. GT Advanced Technologies, which Apple hired to make a new kind of screen glass, filed for bankruptcy after Apple abandoned the project. "It is both a boon and a bane to have Apple as a customer," said Neil Shah, research director at Counterpoint Technology Market Research. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    Shares of home improvement retailer Lowe's Companies Inc. could rise by 20 percent or more, helped by better projected earnings growth this year and greater room for margin improvement, Barron's said on Sunday. Companies such as Lowe's and Home Depot Inc. are uniquely positioned due to their strong outlook, as a healthy economy and improving real estate markets in most of the United States encourages homeowners to undertake renovation, Barron's said. These companies are also "Amazon proof", the report said, noting that home improvement was low on the list of categories the retailer is expected to penetrate. U.S. retail heavyweights including Target Corp., Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Kroger Co. have been locked in a fierce battle against Amazon Inc. While both Home Depot and Lowe's are poised for growth, Lowe's could be more attractive now, due in part to its lower price-to-earnings ratio, the report said. Lowe's shares trade at $82, or about 18 times projected earnings of $4.63 per share for year ending January 2018, while Home Depot trades at $147, or 20.4 times estimated earnings of $7.19 per share in its current year, Barron's said. Lowe's same-store sales performance has lagged Home Depot's the past several quarters, mainly due to its focus on do-it-yourself customers who spend less on big-ticket items than professionals. However, the retailer is taking steps to boost per-store revenue, which would help narrow the valuation gap, Barron's said. Lowe's offers investors exposure to one of retail's strongest sectors, the potential for 15 percent annual earnings growth and a "shareholder friendly" management, according to the report. © 2017 Thomson/Reuters.

Todd Campbell (TMFEBCapital) Apr 3, 2017 at 8:01AM It can be hard for growth investors to decide what stocks to buy because innovation means that today's winners might not be tomorrow's winners. Instead of gambling by focusing on the latest fad, consider building a long-term portfolio that's anchored by Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Celgene (NASDAQ:CELG), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL). All five could have what it takes to sidestep competitive threats and dominate their markets in the coming years. Fiercely loyal consumers Mounting competition from Samsung and low-cost device makers in China had some people thinking that Apple's best days were behind it. However, those predictions haven't panned out -- especially after Samsung's reputation took a big blow when it was forced to recall its Note last year because of defective batteries. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. Apple's iPhones, iPads, and Macs remain best-in-class options for innovation-hungry consumers. Apple's long track record of advancing technology has inspired impressive loyalty that's allowed it to build a profit-friendly ecosystem of services, such as iTunes. After sluggish demand last year, iPhone demand is growing again, and with product refreshes on tap, there's plenty of reason to think that billions of Apple devices will provide a steady source of demand for Apple's app store. Given that Apple has $246 billion in cash on the books, it's got the firepower to invest in R&D to maintain its lead. And since it's generating $65 billion in annual cash flow that can support dividend hikes and buybacks, it's hard to argue that Apple doesn't deserve a spot as a cornerstone holding in growth portfolios. Plenty of market share left to conquer The stacks of Amazon boxes on doorsteps last holiday season may have you thinking that Amazon is close to tapping out its market opportunity, but the numbers suggest that there's enough running room for this company to get much, much bigger. In 2016, Amazon generated $136 billion in sales, up 27% from 2015. While that's a big number, sales would still have to triple for Amazon to match Wal-Mart's top line last year. According to the Census Bureau, online sales are increasing at a double-digit annual pace, but they only represent 8.4% of total retail sales. AMZN Revenue (Annual) data by YCharts. A bigger and wealthier global population offers plenty of expansion opportunity for Amazon's core business, but retail isn't the only reason why Amazon is worth owning in portfolios. Investments in information technology have allowed it to become one of the largest providers of cloud-based solutions, and its Prime service has made it a big source for consumer entertainment, too. Also, its recent push into virtual assistants means that its devices are sitting in living rooms nationwide, and that gives Amazon even more chances to connect with (and profit from) consumers. The company's Amazon Go, a checkout-less store prototype, and its AmazonFresh show it's hoping to shake up the $631 billion grocery retail market soon, too. Expanding its markets It's hard to find a company that's better at innovation than the biotech giant Celgene. It already markets a slate of billion-dollar blockbuster drugs, and it's enjoying a steady stream of revenue and profit growth thanks to R&D investments, acquisitions, and collaborations. Its Revlimid is the most widely used first- and second-line therapy in multiple myeloma, and although Revlimid's sales are already $7 billion per year, R&D programs are expanding its use, and that has management targeting $8 billion in sales this year. It also markets the billion-dollar third-line multiple myeloma drug Pomalyst and the pancreatic cancer drug Abraxane, which brought in $967 million in sales last year. In 2014, management launched the psoriasis drug Otezla, and although it's only been on the market a short time, it's already selling at a $1.2 billion clip. Otezla sales could increase to $1.7 billion or more this year. The company may also launch its first multiple sclerosis drug soon. It acquired ozanimod in 2015 when it bought Receptos for $7 billion, and following late-stage trial results that arguably position it as a best-in-class therapy, management plans to file for FDA approval soon. If approved, this could be yet another blockbuster drug for the company because the MS treatment market is worth $19 billion annually, and it's growing. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. Celgene may also get an FDA OK to begin marketing a new leukemia drug later this year. Celgene co-developed enasidenib with up-and-comer Agios Pharmaceuticals, and a regulatory nod could come within the next few months, giving Celgene yet another intriguing source of growth.  With a stable of top sellers already and the chance for new drugs to hit the market in the coming year, this is one of my favorite growth stock picks for long-term portfolios. Cashing in on community Companies like Snap are attempting to challenge Facebook's dominance as the social media platform of choice, but these competitors will struggle to match Facebook's global reach. Facebook's nearly 2 billion monthly active users are engaging in more meaningful communications with one another than ever before, and tapping into those engagements is providing Facebook with significant revenue and margin expansion opportunities.  In 2016, Facebook's revenue surged 54% to $27.6 billion, and its revenue per monthly user jumped 34% to $15.98. The ability to deliver more meaningful advertising to users and to leverage ad revenue across its fixed costs allowed Facebook's operating margin to expand 10% to 45%, and that translated into a 177% spike in net income to $10.2 billion. Those are some eye-popping growth numbers, but what's even more impressive is that this could still be early days in Facebook's growth opportunity. Facebook's CEO Mark Zuckerberg thinks the company could have 5 billion active users someday, and as it moves toward that user goal, its investments in messaging, video, and devices could generate significant upside for investors over the next few years. For example, its messenger and WhatsApp services boast 1 billion and 1.2 billion monthly active users, respectively, and demand for those services continues to increase. Instagram continues to add advertisers, too. Also exciting is Facebook's secretive Building 8 project that's working on next-generation hardware solutions. Building 8 hasn't announced any specific products yet, but it's only a matter of time before consumers get more insight into how Facebook plans to compete in consumer electronics.  Building better mousetraps Eyeball-friendly simplicity has allowed Alphabet's Google to dominate search for more than a decade, and Alphabet is using its mountainous data to maintain an edge in helping people find and leverage content in increasingly helpful and informative ways. Alphabet changed its name from Google a few years ago to better reflect its commitment to expanding beyond search, and that commitment has turned it into a leader in powering mobile consumer electronics hardware with Android. Approximately 85% of all the world's smartphones sold run on Android.  Last year, Alphabet's full-year revenue increased 20% to $89.5 billion, its free cash flow increased 55%, and its earnings per share increased 22%. That's compelling growth for a company of this size, and as consumers continue to embrace video, Alphabet's YouTube, Play, and Chromecast put it in an enviable position to continue growing. Alphabet is using its massive financial flexibility to ingrain itself even more deeply into consumers' lives. Investments into new projects like Nest and Google Home perfectly position it to profit from the Internet of Things, and moonshots like self-driving cars and healthcare innovation via its Verily Life Sciences make it hard to argue that Alphabet doesn't deserve a spot as a core holding in growth portfolios.   Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

português suomeksi svenska Boom Or Bust: What Is The Future Of The US Retail Industry? Retail Sector Analysis By Creditsafe Reveals Surprising Strength Despite Recent Setbacks News provided by Creditsafe USA Apr 03, 2017, 08:00 ET Share this article ALLENTOWN, Pa., April 3, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Creditsafe USA today released the findings of an in-depth analysis of the US retail sector for Q1 2017.  Despite recent Chapter 11 filings by such notable retailers as Sports Authority and American Apparel and store closings by other retail heavy-weights such as Sears and JCPenny, the US retail sector as whole remains incredibly strong and shows no signs of slowing down. "The Creditsafe Guide: Demystifying the US Retail Industry" looks at the overall health of US companies in the retail sector for the first quarter of 2017. When compared to other industries, the retail sector is the second largest in the United States in terms of the number of businesses, encompassing nearly 14%. It ranks third as far as the number of individuals employed by the sector with nearly 10% of the country's workforce. "Our study reveals that while a number of the big retail players have experienced financial hardships, there is a huge portion of the retail sector that are performing very well," explained Matthew Debbage, CEO of Creditsafe USA and Asia.  "In today's retail landscape, the e-commerce giants such as Amazon and Walmart are giving the traditional department stores a run for their money. Interestingly, however, it is the small companies with either less than 100 employees or sales less than $10M that are experiencing rapid growth. They are truly thriving." Highlights of the report include: **44% of retail companies are rated low risk compared to 42% of business in other industries **12% lower instances of bankruptcy in the retail sector compared to business in other industries "There is an apparent change happening within this sector, and companies that are embracing the change will become stronger. And, it's inherently clear things are still booming in the retail sector," added Debbage. Creditsafe's global database is one of the most rapidly expanding and most comprehensive in the industry. It is updated over a million times a day with information gathered from over 200 sources. In 99.9% of the cases, reports requested by customers are delivered instantly online.  And, over 40% of Credisafe's customers, leverage the company's internationally reporting capabilities. Creditsafe offers customers unlimited and open access to information and ratings on companies in every industry in almost every country.

just-style home News & insights Blogs Blog: Navigating global political frictions and economic uncertainty Leonie Barrie | 28 March 2017 As a barometer of the issues top of mind for apparel sourcing executives, it is hard to beat the annual Prime Source Forum in Hong Kong. Among the takeaways from this year’s event were the challenges of navigating global political frictions and economic uncertainty, as well as the sea-change across the retail sector thanks to the rise of e-commerce, digitally-connected consumers, 'see now, buy now' expectations, fickle millennials, store closures and competition from online specialists. But speakers also pointed out that responding to this uncertainty is immaterial if the apparel and footwear industry can't engineer and produce products that consumers actually want to buy. Investment in automation and efficiencies, as well as facing up to skills shortages, are among the unlocks for the future fashion sourcing landscape. Another recurring theme was the need for digitalisation of products and processes and analysis of the resulting data to deliver on demands for speed, customisation and transparency. Exemplifying the changes underway, Hong Kong-based sourcing specialist Li & Fung has just inked a new deal to create the "supply chain of the future" for PVH Corp, owner of the Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein brands. Services on offer will help speed reaction time and capitalise more on digital, data and personalisation trends in retail. German sportswear giant Adidas is also evaluating the results of its Storefactory research project to decide whether to roll out localised and personalised consumer experiences in its stores. And US retail giant Walmart is further beefing up its e-commerce strategy with the acquisition of women's online fashion and accessory retailer ModCloth. This is the latest move by Walmart to compete more effectively with e-commerce players such as Amazon. Meanwhile, the European Commission (EC) is being urged to bring forward legislation to enhance due diligence for apparel supply chains – and to introduce European Union (EU) tariff preferences and labels for sustainably produced textiles and garments. First feedback on the new Corporate Human Rights Benchmark (CHRB) has welcomed the move – but also warns against drawing conclusions too quickly and highlights a number of critical issues such as the quality and credibility of information, governance and price pressures. And US apparel and footwear companies are urging the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to reconsider the appropriateness of its 2014 guidance on "conflict minerals" given its cost to brands and lack of impact to date. A just-style analysis of the proposed Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP or T-TIP) free trade agreement between the US and the EU looks at what the pact might mean for the textile and apparel industries. While in other news, Sears has expressed "substantial doubt" as to whether it can continue to operate as a profitable business; Levi Strauss is investigating an explosion at a factory in Cambodia; retailer Next has booked its first fall in annual profits in eight years; and Vietnam has drafted a new regulation on the use of formaldehyde and azo dyes in textile and apparel products sold in the country.

The BBC has uncovered thousands of videos that feature popular cartoon characters like Peppa Pig, Minions, Thomas the Tank Engine, Disney characters such as Mickey Mouse and Princess Elsa from Frozen, and Marvel characters like the Incredible Hulk and Spiderman. The disturbing difference, however, is that these videos are dangerous parodies. The animations are convincing enough, so much so that toddlers might not be able to tell the difference. The plot soon turns dark minutes into these videos. Peppa, for instance, has her teeth pulled out and is clearly in a lot of pain. Elsa gets pregnant in one video, and breaks her arm in another. A recently created YouTube channel called SG Narratives is producing videos that explore the dynamics between people in modern relationships. In this video, Edmund (left) and Sean answer a set of given questions designed to encourage an honest, and at times emotional, exchange. PHOTO: SCREENSHOT FROM YOUTUBE Mickey Mouse gets his ears cut off, while Spiderman tries to take off the bikini of a female beach-goer. The videos came to light after journalist and parent Laura June noticed something was not quite right with what her three-year-old daughter was watching. "Peppa does a lot of screaming and crying and the dentist is just a bit sadistic and it's just way, way off what a three-year-old should watch," she says. While an adult might notice the discrepancy, a child might not be equipped to do so, adds Ms June. The view counts for some of these videos are close to 200 million, which could mean they have been watched by many, many children. BBC reporters tried contacting the people behind the channel Toys And Funny Kids Surprise Eggs - one of the top 100 most watched YouTube accounts - but did not receive a response. Subsequently, YouTube responded to the reports in a statement. "We take feedback very seriously. We appreciate people drawing problematic content to our attention, and make it easy for anyone to flag a video," it said. Several channels have subsequently been pulled down. The latest development comes hot on the heels of an ongoing advertising boycott by major brands over concerns that YouTube is not able to prevent marketing campaigns from appearing alongside repugnant videos. PepsiCo, Wal-Mart and Starbucks have reportedly suspended their advertising on the video platform after it was revealed that their ads were playing ahead of clips containing racist content. YouTube suggested that parents use the "kids" version of its app and monitor what their kids are watching. On the flip side, there were also several users who defended the videos, insisting that the content was clearly meant for adults. Notable trends LANGHAN PLACE: The video trended after an escalator malfunctioned in Hong Kong's Langham Place. It was one of the top videos on YouTube and the Facebook page of The Straits Times. SAMSUNG S8: Samsung launched its latest flagship smartphone, the Galaxy S8, on Wednesday as the company sought to shake off the damage done by the global recall of its Note7 smartphones. CYCLONE DEBBIE: Heavy rain left large areas of Queensland, Australia, submerged in floodwaters last week as the cyclone swept down the coast. "Obviously, the responsibility of what children watch lies with their parents, not the platform. Please be better parents," said one user. HONEST CONVERSATIONS SG Narratives, a recently created YouTube channel, has been making waves for exploring the dynamics between people in modern relationships. In the videos, two people sit opposite each other and answer a set of given questions designed to encourage an honest exchange. This enables them to "listen to each other, no matter how difficult". Some of the questions include: "Where do you see us in 10 years?", "Who holds the power in our relationship?" and "Why do you love me?" What sets the series apart is how the conversations touch on emotional issues. In one video, a couple - Rachel and Billy who have been dating for 18 months - discuss the question: "What's the pain in me you would like to heal?" Rachel says she wants to support Billy emotionally, given his family situation which was not elaborated upon, and that she feels he is still withholding information from her. In another video, same-sex couple Edmund and Sean, who have been together for five years, talk about what their respective families think of them. Sean candidly admits he has yet to tell his parents about his sexual orientation, but it is something he is working on. Another issue the couple talk about is personal trainer Sean's future career plans. "How long can your muscles last?" Edmund asks. SG Narratives was started as a passion project by three friends - music director Nurzatiman Astha, 33, finance support officer Syakir Ryli, 27, and creative director Sudirwan Juhaimi, 33. Mr Sudirwan tells The Sunday Times that the trio took inspiration from an Emmy award-winning interactive documentary created by studio The Skin Deep. "Singaporeans shun difficult conversations, especially with loved ones. It's because of our non-confrontational nature. "We do not have the tools equipped to deal with real honesty - to receive it and to deliver it," he says. "But the thing is, the most difficult conversations are the conversations we need to have." Comments left on the videos have been largely positive. One YouTube user said: "Their honesty, connection, reflection and respect for each other is so beautiful. All relationships can learn from this." Mr Sudirwan says their upcoming videos will also feature couples who have broken up, newly married couples and cousins. The channel releases new videos every Tuesday at noon. DON'T LIVE-STREAM AND DRIVE A young Russian woman identified as Sitora B was reportedly broadcasting her drive to work in Kazan, Tatarstan, when she was involved in a fatal car accident. Seconds before the video cuts off, the 22-year-old is seen cheerfully singing in her car and looking straight into her smartphone, which was placed under the steering wheel. She had also been reading and replying to messages from her followers during the stream. According to reports, her small car was involved in a collision with a bus. The impact was such that she was flung from the driver's seat. Local police reportedly confirmed the accident, and attributed it to the driver being "constantly distracted from the control of her car". They advised people to stop live-streaming while driving. There were more than 4,000 cases of drivers using their smartphones while on the road last year alone. The bus driver and another passenger were also injured in the incident. Some netizens, however, have doubted the authenticity of the report as they were not able to find her stream. But, real or fake, one YouTube user noted: "Treasure your one and only life. "Streaming your activities to your followers can wait till you arrive safely at your destination." A version of this article appeared in the print edition of The Sunday Times on April 02, 2017, with the headline 'Take care - those cartoons may not be kid-friendly'.

Now the latest on that teacher who ran away with a former student. A photo was released overnight in Nebraska. Eva pilgrim has details. Reporter: Today marks three weeks since these two disappeared. For much of that time nothing. Not a clue but now at least one confirmed sighting giving her family some hope. This morning, Nebraska police posting this surveillance cam photo of what they say could be tad Cummins with 15-year-old Elizabeth Thomas at the McDonald's this past Sunday. While they haven't been able to possley identify them yet, this new video of the pair in Oklahoma gives fresh clues in the three-week search for the Tennessee teen and her alleged kidnapper. It was good to be able to see her face again. Reporter: Tad Cummins and Elizabeth Thomas captured on security cameras at a Walmart in Oklahoma City two days after her disappearance. Nearly 700 miles away from her home in Columbia, Tennessee. The new pictures showing small changes to their appearance. Thomas' hair darkened red and Cummins' gray facial hair now brown. They bought food paying with cash and this morning authorities are still trying to determine if they were still traveling in Cummins' silver SUV. He was certainly putting a lot of planning into disappearing. He served what size mattress will fit in the back of a Nissan rogue. Can that particular model be traced via gps? Reporter: The two disappearing after Cummins was accused of having an inappropriate relationship with his teenage student allegedly writing intimate e-mails and even reportedly caught kissing Thomas. He was trying to romantically persuade her to come to him. Reporter: While authorities say they don't know where Cummins was planning to go, they are now saying they do know that he packed warm weather clothes, shorts and t-shirts for this trip. Please, if you have a sighting call 911 as soon as possible. That's the only way we can move forward. Reporter: This morning investigators say they have no idea where the two could be but these new images giving her family new hope. I feel at least hopeful that I've seen her, Elizabeth, if you can hear me, please come back to us. Reporter: Now Cummins' wife who had publicly pleaded for him to release Elizabeth has now filed for divorce and the reward to find these two is now at $10,000. Just a reminder how important these tips are this morning, George. Thanks very much. More now from our special consultant and former FBI agent Brad Garrett. Brad, thanks for joining us. Let's start out with surveillance video that shows some interaction between them. What does it tell you? Well, the one in the Walmart store, watch. He's in front of her. It looks like it at times she's not looking very happy. He's not physically controlling her but it looks like to me he's continualing to psychologically control her. Well, yeah, you would think that has to be the case given how long they've been together at this point. And now the net is so wide. Well, the net is wide, George, but if, in fact, this new sighting and I question whether that's accurate or not in kearney, Nebraska, as to what direction they're going. One thing fugitives do, George, is they go directions where they have been. For example, does he have any history in the west? Did he work thery does he have an ex-wife? Does he have children? All of those things because we tend to go to places we have a history. What is it about the photo ma takes you question it. Well, there's something different about the facial hair in the photograph in kearney, Nebraska, so I would like to see a better photograph before I made a decision as to whether that's the two of them. Okay, Brad Garrett, thanks very much. This transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 3 April 2017 by Military News Boom Or Bust: What Is The Future Of The US Retail Industry? Retail Sector Analysis By Creditsafe Reveals Surprising Strength Despite Recent Setbacks ALLENTOWN, Pa., April 3, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Creditsafe USA today released the findings of an in-depth analysis of the US retail sector for Q1 2017.  Despite recent Chapter 11 filings by such notable retailers as Sports Authority and American Apparel and store closings by other retail heavy-weights such as Sears and JCPenny, the US retail sector as whole remains incredibly strong and shows no signs of slowing down. "The Creditsafe Guide: Demystifying the US Retail Industry" looks at the overall health of US companies in the retail sector for the first quarter of 2017. When compared to other industries, the retail sector is the second largest in the United States in terms of the number of businesses, encompassing nearly 14%. It ranks third as far as the number of individuals employed by the sector with nearly 10% of the country's workforce. "Our study reveals that while a number of the big retail players have experienced financial hardships, there is a huge portion of the retail sector that are performing very well," explained Matthew Debbage, CEO of Creditsafe USA and Asia.  "In today's retail landscape, the e-commerce giants such as Amazon and Walmart are giving the traditional department stores a run for their money. Interestingly, however, it is the small companies with either less than 100 employees or sales less than $10M that are experiencing rapid growth. They are truly thriving." Highlights of the report include: **44% of retail companies are rated low risk compared to 42% of business in other industries **12% lower instances of bankruptcy in the retail sector compared to business in other industries "There is an apparent change happening within this sector, and companies that are embracing the change will become stronger. And, it's inherently clear things are still booming in the retail sector," added Debbage. Creditsafe's global database is one of the most rapidly expanding and most comprehensive in the industry. It is updated over a million times a day with information gathered from over 200 sources. In 99.9% of the cases, reports requested by customers are delivered instantly online.  And, over 40% of Credisafe's customers, leverage the company's internationally reporting capabilities. Creditsafe offers customers unlimited and open access to information and ratings on companies in every industry in almost every country. Each day, over 200,000 users around the world leverage the company's database to make over 450,000 business decisions.  Currently, Creditsafe has 14 offices around the world and maintains the only truly global international database of online credit information.  Globally, the company reported a 28 percent growth in revenue over the past twelve months.

(Credit: AP) advertisement | advertise on newsday MOCOA, Colombia - Jose Albeiro Vargas last saw his grandson the night fierce rain unleashed havoc on this small city surrounded by rivers and mountains in southern Colombia. From what Vargas has been able to gather, the torrents of mud, water and debris unleashed on the city of Mocoa by the rain-swollen river swept away his daughter and her 18-month-old grandson, Jadir Estiven. Ever since, has been searching for them without success.

He is far from the only person in Mocoa searching desperately for young loved ones. At least 43 children were among the confirmed dead from the devastating flood, according to President Juan Manuel Santos. The national disaster management agency said Monday that the official death toll had increased to 262. The young may have been particularly vulnerable in this disaster because nearly all were in bed when the floods surged through the city of 40,000 Friday night and early Saturday. 1:12 WorldRaw: Cleanup underway in Colombia after flooding Maria Cordoba, 52, said two of her nephews, ages 6 and 11, were killed when their house was destroyed. "The mother as well was totally beaten up" but managed to save her 18-month-old baby, she said while at the river trying to clean items she salvaged from her home. advertisement | advertise on newsday The death toll from the flood, one of the worst natural disasters to strike the country in years, was expected to rise as many people were injured or remained unaccounted for, and bodies were still being pulled from the thick mud, tree limbs and debris that covered much of the city. The deluge smashed houses, tore trees out by the roots and washed cars and trucks away. Search-and-rescue teams combed through the debris and helped people who had been clawing at huge mounds of mud by hand. "People went to their houses and found nothing but the floor," said Gilma Diaz, a 42-year-old from another town who came to search for a cousin. Dozens stood in the door of a hospital, hoping for news of family members who were not on the list of those confirmed dead or injured. Others frantically knocked on relatives' doors, hoping to find someone with information about their loved ones. A rescue worker in an orange jumpsuit emerged from one search area with the body of an infant wrapped in a towel. Not far away, Abelardo Solarte, a 48-year-old resident of Mocoa, held a child's shoe as he helped clear debris. @Newsday Tweets from @Newsday/newsday-staff "You have no idea how many kids there are around here," Solarte said. Jair Echarri, who came from a nearby town to help, also struggled to comprehend the loss of so many children. "I am a father and this breaks my heart," he said. Santos, who visited Mocoa for a second straight day Sunday, declared the area a disaster zone. The president said the avalanche of water and debris also destroyed roads and bridges, knocked out power in half of the province of Putumayo, where Mocoa is located, and destroyed the area's fresh water network, creating dangerous and unsanitary conditions. Mocoa is vulnerable to flooding. It is surrounded by the three rivers in a natural basin created by the surrounding mountains. The danger has grown worse in recent years because of deforestation, which eliminates some protection from runoff, and because many people built their homes close to the water. But the triggering event was rainfall of more than 5 inches (130 millimeters) that began late Friday. advertisement | advertise on newsday "The rain fell on Mocoa with an intensity and force that was without precedent and devastating," Santos said. "It rained in two hours what falls in a month in Bogota." A 1989 hydrology report for the Agricultural Ministry warned that just such a disaster could happen unless steps were taken to reinforce the riverbanks, channel water away from the town and restore some of the forest. It was not immediately clear why those steps had not been taken. Juan Chanchi de Ruiz, 74, said the noise of the surging flood woke her up and gave her enough time to get to higher ground. Her house was unscathed, but several neighbors' homes were heavily damaged and many people fled with some of their belongings. "Around here, there's nobody. Everybody left," she said. Colombian officials pledged aid to rebuild homes, and the attorney general launched an investigation into whether local and national authorities responded adequately to the disaster. Santos also said they would launch a health and vaccination campaign in the city to prevent an outbreak of disease. advertisement | advertise on newsday "Mocoa needs to rise up from this blow," he said.

Paul Moseley Star-Telegram i By Alex Daugherty adaugherty@mcclatchydc.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story WASHINGTON President Donald Trump wants to tackle tax reform after his health care overhaul failed, a massive effort considering the nation’s tax code hasn’t changed substantially since Ronald Reagan’s administration. Trump has a fellow businessman in Congress eager to tackle taxes. Rep. Roger Williams, the longtime Weatherford, Texas-based car dealer who now lives in Austin, proposed his own tax reform plan a year ago in anticipation of a friendly face in the White House. Now, he wants to work with Trump to get something done. But there’s a potential hangup. A tax reform proposal cannot increase the federal deficit after 10 years, or else it will need 60 votes in the Senate to pass, and Republicans only hold 52 seats. So House GOP leadership must raise taxes or cut spending to pay for a lower tax rate. The current proposal, trumpeted by House Speaker Paul Ryan and Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, also a Texan, imposes a border adjustment tax on imported goods. The tax will supposedly raise $1.2 trillion over 10 years to offset decreased federal revenues due to lower corporate and personal taxes, and its proponents argue the tax will benefit American-based manufacturing. But the border adjustment tax is a non-starter for Williams and some Senate Republicans. “In my business, if I want to cut my car prices to try and sell more cars, I don’t raise prices, I lower prices and cut expenses,” Williams said. “That’s what you do in your family, that’s what we all do. This is no different. And a five percent border tax increases the cost of goods, it flows to the consumer and it’s just a tax increase.” Instead of the border adjustment tax, Williams argues that conservatives need to get serious about cutting expenses to make a tax reform effort deficit-neutral. Williams wants to cut the Department of Education, but that effort would come nowhere near the required savings to lower tax rates. Harry Stein, director of fiscal policy at the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank, said Republicans don’t have a plan to make tax reform revenue-neutral in the long term, even if a boarder adjustment tax passes. “On the House side, Ryan and Brady have been very clear they want to do something permanent, but the Better Way tax plan isn’t revenue neutral,” Stein said. “I think there’s a rhetoric versus reality disconnect there that’s important. Even if you take most dynamic score it loses $1.9 trillion in the second decade.” Williams said he’s been in contact with Gary Cohn, Trump’s chief economic adviser and former COO of Goldman Sachs, over his tax reform proposal, but it’s unclear where Trump stands on the border adjustment tax. Proponents of the measure were hopeful that Trump would embrace the idea after railing against free trade agreements during the campaign, and that a tax on foreign-made goods would appeal to Trump’s populist streak. However, Trump has been largely silent on the proposal since assuming office. EDITORS: STORY CAN END HERE Big importers such as Wal-Mart and Target are pushing the White House to reconsider the House plan. “We have a great relationship with Chairman Brady, but on this one we just flat out disagree with the approach,” said Texas Retailers Association president and CEO George Kelemen. “Specific to Texas, it’s our grocery sector...we import avocados, bananas and coffee. Those are products we don’t produce or grow enough of and if you put a 20 percent tax on all that imagine what that does to the household grocery bill.” A number of Senate Republicans have also voiced opposition to the border adjustment tax. Arguably the biggest opponent is Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton, as Wal-Mart is based in his state. Texas Sen. John Cornyn said, “There’s many unanswered questions about proposed border adjustment tax” in a January tweet. Georgia Sen. David Perdue sent a letter to his colleagues in February blasting the proposal. If three senators vote against a tax reform plan, it will fail. Williams said the White House can learn a lot to prepare for a tax reform fight after the Obamacare replacement bill failed in spectacular fashion last week. He said speeding the bill through Congress would result in a half-baked proposal that satisfies no one. “We have to have this conversation so we don’t have another health care debacle,” Williams said. “But tax reform in my mind is pretty easy.” EDITORS: STORY CAN END HERE Chris Edwards of the Cato Institute, a libertarian policy institute funded by the Koch Brothers, said the border adjustment tax is solely a political instrument to pass the bill in the Senate and has nothing to do with promoting American industry. “I suspect they (House leadership) thought it was sort of a parallel to Trump’s comments on international trade and Trump administration would support that sort of tax change,” Edwards said. “Strangely, it really hasn’t worked out that way, and Cohn made some comments the other day that were negative on it. The GOP has to get rid of border adjustment thing, it’s splitting the business community and they all need to be on board.” Williams and GOP leadership agree on the need to lower corporate and personal taxes, and on the nuts-and-bolts they aren’t too far off. “I’m talking about a 20 percent corporate tax across the board, Trump’s talking 15,” Williams said. But in addition to the border adjustment tax there’re two other cost-saving solutions Williams vehemently opposes: getting rid of tax deductions for charitable giving and home mortgages. “There’s people talking about doing away with charitable giving? That’s America for crying out loud,” Williams said. “America is a giving nation with compassion. We’re talking about doing away with mortgage interest, well how the hell do you buy a house?” The House Republican proposal keeps the charitable giving and mortgage deductions but eliminates all other itemized deductions.

Frank Gehry Archive Acquired by Getty Etched in Stone – Former Home Savings Building is here to stay Come See the Softer Side of Sears Posted By: Atlas Novackon: April 03, 2017In: News, Opinion, Santa Monica1 Comment Print Email By Steve Stajich Nostalgia is a drug used frequently by writers. Much of writing, not to be confused with typing, comes into being from the memory banks of the writer. But as a drug, nostalgia has its side effects. Weariness of heart, crying over already spilled milk, and pulling muscles as one attempts to hang on to the past when the present has clearly replaced it. A March 23 article in the LA Times business section revealed that even Sears doesn’t fully believe in Sears’s brick and mortar retail stores anymore. The CFO of the parent company that also owns Kmart stores stated that it had warned regulators “substantial doubt exists” that Sears’s stores could keep their doors open, even though they are fighting right up to the end to save “a viable business.” The warning caused the company’s stock to plunge 12.3 percent. That only provides a kind of moody preamble to what I experienced this week as I spent about an hour inside downtown Santa Monica’s Sears store at 4th and Colorado. Plastered everywhere were bright yellow and red signs blaring “Store Closing – 25 to 75 percent off!” Inside, well, if there is such a thing as a department store ghost town this was it. It would be one thing to confront empty shelves and even mannequins stripped of their clothing. To discover that the shelves and the mannequins themselves were for sale cut me deeper. I learned from two employees pulling the shelving hardware from a display wall that our Santa Monica Sears would close around the middle of April. Somewhere online there is a collection of photos that shows nothing but closed stores and failed shopping malls with their interiors in decay. Those photos are a bit more ominous than the current state of our downtown Sears store, but experiencing both together paints a picture of brick and mortar retail currently in a coma if not a dirt nap. Sears began in 1886 as a mail order catalogue, but it began opening retail locations in 1925. In 2005 the Kmart chain bought Sears and the whole thing became Sears Holdings. Impressively, if you go back and count the number of economic recessions, Sears was the largest retailer in America until October of 1989. That’s when they got beat by Walmart. (Cue trumpet player: taps.) By one account, it’s still the fifth-largest American department store as of 2013, but let me ask you: When’s the last time you were in a “department store”? Which brings me back to my walk through of our Sears in Santa Monica. A lot of the discount merchandise still in the building spoke to the way brick and mortar retail depends on the Christmas holidays for a major chunk of their sales. At amazing prices were such items as “Dory” and “Frozen” gift boxes containing bath gel and body spray. Nearby was a package shaped to look like a tool box filled with pretzels and nuts and offered as “The Craftsman Tool Box of Snacks.” But big stuff was on deep discount as well. Kenmore washers and dryers were 25 percent off and a couple wandering the rows of floor models seemed almost ready to close on a deal, despite a warning sign to all who dared to walk the Sears haunted house that they should “Shop Wisely: All Sales are Final.” A guy buying deeply discounted tools kept pulling more things off the rack as a clerk rang up his Craftsman bench top sander and grinder. I took these events as proof that the brands Sears had spent decades building – Kenmore, Craftsman, Die Hard – still carried some weight with consumers. Even if that “Tool Box of Snacks” was way past its freshness date, there was a pair of Die Hard work boots that I almost took home, at the last moment remembering that I rarely do any work. It was at this point that my findings became suspect because walking through Santa Monica’s dying Sears store I was intoxicated by the drug of nostalgia. As a kid, I went with my family to the Bay Shore Shopping Center (remember “shopping centers?”) in Milwaukee where Sears was the biggest and best thing there. In the appliance department, a vacuum cleaner hose was pointed upward and supported a rotating beach ball on its powerful blast of reversed suction. Open the refrigerator floor models and there were rubber bottles of milk and plastic meat. You know, to show folks how a refrigerator works. The store was big and sprawling, the sales force attentive and persuasive. At an even larger North Milwaukee Sears, there was often so much traffic in the parking lot that a man sat and looked out a window and through a PA system directed cars to empty parking spaces. “Green Chevy wagon, aisle 14 F.” For longer than you’d think, I thought that was the greatest job ever. But I was missing the bigger picture: A retail store that was so popular and, yes, trusted by consumers that it needed an air traffic controller in its parking lot. Alas, no longer. Long ago Sears had a slogan to highlight its clothing and other non-tool and appliance merchandise: “Come see the softer side of Sears.” There’s nothing more vulnerable-looking than a closing three-story department store lying on its side, gasping, what little is left marked way down. Still, I am already nostalgic for the Santa Monica Sears.

It’s still has the awning you drive under to get gas, glass windowed customer lounge, door in back to get your car fixed. Eventually Sears built a larger repair shop across the street that has since been torn down for the train. Probably the only Allstate gas station left in the United States and I’m sure it will go the way of the wrecking ball. Be nice if it was turned into a restaurant to maintain it’s heritage.

Not only does it get to make some cool figures and replica weapons, with Destiny's armour shader system the repaint potential is massive. Here are four retailer-exclusive variants dropping in July. For reference, here are the original paint jobs for the Hunter, Warlock and Titan figures announced by McFarlane Toys during the New York Toy Fair earlier this year. For the three of the four retailer exclusives, which should be available in July for $US19.99 ($26), McFarlane not only swapped colours, they swapped out helmets as well. Warlock fans will be able to pick up the black and orange Hallow Shader variant figure at GameStop. He's wearing the latest in Light Beyond Nemesis helmet technology. Highly detailed sculpt of the Warlock modelled from in-game assets. Sculpted figure features the Hollow Shader, complete with Light Beyond Nemesis Helmet. Figure comes with the Touch of Malice Scout Rifle and Ice Breaker Sniper Rifle. Fully customisable figure with 14+ points of articulation for dynamic posing. Figure comes in window boxed collector packaging and featured on a stylised Destiny branded display base. GameStop is also accepting preorders for the replica Gjallarhorn, which can be yours for only $US169.99 ($223). Walmart gets the short end of the stick. The Million Million Shader Hunter figure is a straight-up recolor of the main Hunter fig, with the same old face. Take that, Walmart. Highly detailed sculpt of the Hunter modelled from in-game assets. Sculpted figure features the Million Million Shader, Accessories include Thorn Hand Cannon and Bolt-Caster Sword, Fully customisable figure with 14+ points of articulation for dynamic posing, Figure comes in window boxed collector packaging and featured on a stylised Destiny branded display base, Meanwhile, at Walgreens (the other Walstore), the Blacksmith Shader Hunter not only looks good, it also gets to try on the Celestial Nighthawk helmet for size. Highly detailed sculpt of the Hunter modelled from in-game assets. Sculpted figure features the Blacksmith Shader, complete with Celestial Nighthawk Helmet. Figure comes with the Thorn hand cannon and Invective Shotgun. Fully customisable figure with 14+ points of articulation for dynamic posing. Figure comes in window boxed collector packaging and featured on a stylised Destiny branded display base. Bye far the best of the four comes from Target. I do not play a Titan, but damn if the Amduat Ink Shader Titan doesn't make me want to pound the ground. It's like Iron Man and a Roman legionnaire had sex, and then Tony Stark gave him this armour as thanks. Highly detailed sculpt of the Titan modelled from in-game assets. Sculpted figure features the Amduat Ink Shader, complete with Helm of Saint-14 Helmet. Figure comes with the iconic Gjallarhorn Rocket Launcher and Hung Jury Scout Rifle. Fully customisable figure with 14+ points of articulation for dynamic posing. Figure comes in window boxed collector packaging and featured on a stylised Destiny branded display base. Pretty nifty, eh? What McFarlane really needs to do is release all three of the figures blank and let players pain their own. Until then, we've got these babies.

Police in Kearney, Nebraska, said in a Facebook post late Sunday night that they had a "possible" sighting of 50-year-old Tad Cummins and 15-year-old Elizabeth Thomas at a McDonald's in Kearney on Sunday evening. The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation said today the photos were not of Cummins and Elizabeth.

Our search continues. pic.twitter.com/BJJrFD7YA4— TBI (@TBInvestigation) April 3, 2017 The false sighting comes days after the TBI confirmed an earlier sighting of the two in Oklahoma City. Surveillance video from that sighting, released on Friday, was taken at a Wal-Mart in Oklahoma City on March 15, two days after the teen was allegedly abducted. The Wal-Mart sighting is the only confirmed sighting of the two since they disappeared on March 13. Cummins, who was fired one day after the alleged kidnapping, is wanted on allegations of aggravated kidnapping and sexual contact with a minor. An Amber Alert has been issued for Elizabeth.

Researchers also found that most (59%) would purchase more if retailers had a better understanding of their wants/interests. For example, nearly two-thirds (63%) say Amazon offers 'relevant recommendations' to them, but only one-third (33%) say Walmart offers relevant recommendations. Fewer than one-third reported that Big-Box stores including Target, Macy's, and Kohl's offered relevant recommendations. "What we're seeing is that big-box retailers are still not putting sufficient resources behind personalizing the customer experience, and as a result, are losing out on valuable opportunities to generate more repeat customers - a key aspect of a strong bottom line," said Phil Seward, Regional Director, Americas at ICLP. "By failing to excel at the three tenets of customer loyalty - communication, customer understanding and rewards - even the largest and most powerful brands are at risk of losing business to smaller competitors that make their customers feel valued." Meanwhile, Yahoo's new study indicates that campaigns could improve as much as 40% if brands put the right emotional undertone to the ads. Researchers found that reaching consumers when they're feeling upbeat resulted in 24% higher engagement. "Digital marketers all appreciate the importance of reaching the right person, on the right device, at the right time. But the 'right time' should be about more than the webpage they're viewing at that moment. We should be striving to take a consumer's emotions into account as well. The idea of aiming to engage with consumers when they are feeling upbeat may seem obvious at first, but never before have we been able to appreciate the extent of the impact it can have on a campaign's success. Nor have we had concrete insight into when during the day this emotional state is most likely, and what types of marketing will benefit most. These new insights reinforce the importance of context in marketing, and take it to a whole new level," said Nigel Clarkson, Managing Director, Yahoo UK. Other interesting findings from the Yahoo report include: • 40% of US and UK consumers are usually upbeat • US and UK consumers are the most upbeat between 11am and 2pm • 71% say they are more likely to click on ads that are relevant to what they're doing News in your inbox Tags: advertising, advertising trends, ICLP, loyalty marketing, Yahoo Tweet No Comments Email to a friend Print this article Subscribe to BizReport Please enter your e-mail here: Email this article to: Your email address: Message (optional): More articles from this category SMBs: Top 3 tips to protect against scammers | April 03, 2017 Report IDs differences in how people connect on SnapChat | April 03, 2017 HTC augments Viveport VR marketplace with eye-tracking ad tech | April 03, 2017 More Stories on Related Topics Advertising Loyalty Marketing Research Trends & Ideas Latest Headlines Three-quarters of UK companies do not provide formal pitch training Mobile-First consumers more receptive to brand messaging on social media Report IDs differences in how people connect on SnapChat SMBs: Top 3 tips to protect against scammers Reports: Communication, Emotion key for engagement HTC augments Viveport VR marketplace with eye-tracking ad tech Clutch: SMBs focus on wrong SEO metrics Reality of online retail service experience 'average' More...

The victim, who lives in Nassau County, was entering her vehicle on 1220 Old Country Road around 1:30 p.m. when a man armed with a large knife demanded money, police said. He forced her into the passenger seat, took her keys and drove out of the parking lot with the victim. They arrived at an Elmont Chase Bank and coerced her to give him her ATM car and PIN before withdrawing an undisclosed amount of dollars. The man left the bank and drove to Dutch Broadway in vicinity of Audrey Avenue, where he fled on foot westbound on Dutch Broadway to Audrey Avenue. During the robbery, the victim was pushed and she sustained an injury to her upper body. The injury is non-life threatening but she will seek medical attention on her own. The attacker is described to be about 6 feet tall, in his 20s, thin-build wearing a dark baseball cap. Cops released a sketch of the carjacker.

Food Pick Six 6 beers you should try this month Including a cucumber Florida weisse and a saison from Trader Joe’s By Andrew Gill @andrewgill Apr 3, 2017 12:00 AM Illustration: Nick Wanserski Illustration: Nick Wanserski Pick Six is The A.V. Club’s monthly recommendations for the beers we’re currently digging. This month’s picks turn a hopeful eye toward the promise of spring, while keeping a sweater handy for those days that are supposed to reach 70 degrees but top out at 49 (I’m looking at you, Chicago). There are some spring-appropriate ingredients in these beers, including rose hips, raspberries, lemongrass, juniper berries, cherries, and cucumber. 1. Revolution Brewing Anti-Hero IPA is a beer that Chicagoans apparently order more than any brew besides Miller and Coors (at least at places that use BevSpot software). While that news initially shocked me, it made sense once I thought about it—after all, I do usually buy super fresh cans of it whenever I shop at Target. It’s a straightforward, modern, 6.5 percent ABV (alcohol by volume) IPA with strong hop flavor that veers ever so slightly to the fruit side of the pine-to-citrus spectrum. One of the fastest-growing breweries in Chicago (and the largest independent brewery in Illinois), Revolution is now available in six states, including New York and Massachusetts. 2. Green Flash Brewing Fearless Fifty is a saison brewed for Trader Joe’s 50th anniversary celebration. In light of Wal-Mart’s recent legal trouble over selling fake craft beer, Green Flash’s model seems to be a good one for selling grocery store exclusives. At 5.5 percent ABV, this farmhouse style with subtle flavors from rose hips and sweet orange peel is easy to love. If you see it at Trader Joe’s, be sure to stock up since they don’t plan to brew this one again. 3. Two Roads Brewing Road Jam Raspberry Wheat was a pleasant surprise when it showed up on my doorstep via UPS direct from the largest craft brewer in Connecticut. I’d never had a Two Roads beer before, and this 5 percent ABV wheat ale with raspberry and lemongrass could have been a cloying mess of a fruit beer. Instead it was a light and refreshing drink, with tartness from the lemongrass and subtle bitter flavor from the raspberry. 4. Coppertail Brewing Company Slam Piece Florida Weisse is a delicious example of the Sunshine State’s most significant contribution to brewing culture—a riff on the Berliner Weisse infused with local produce. This 3.5 percent ABV brew isn’t the original Florida weisse (J. Wakefield Brewing is credited with inventing the style), but it was the only native Florida beer to medal at the 2016 Great American Beer Festival. In this case, the local produce is cucumber, and the beer managed to taste tart and accentuate its sweeter flavor profile. This is a truly remarkable beer. 5. Ommegang Rosetta Kriek isn’t actually brewed by the Cooperstown, New York brewery. Instead it asked the brewers at its Belgian sister brewery, Liefmans—a more than 300-year-old establishment also owned by Duvel Moortgat—to do what they do best: blend a fruity cherry beer with a Flemish brown aged on cherries for three years. For American beer drinkers, that’s great news because Ommegang distributes this 5.6 percent ABV beer in 43 states, making it much easier to find than many Belgian imports. It’s a perfect beer for April—on the cold days the layers of flavor provide plenty to ponder indoors, and on warm ones you can focus on the fecund and fruity flavor of cherries. 6. Off Color Brewing Bare Bear Sahti is another beer that can work in warm or cold weather depending on how you look at it. The Off Color website says this 500-year-old Finnish style is traditionally brewed in home saunas, which are equipped with filters made of juniper branches that the beer passes through en route to fermentation tanks. The Chicago brewery approximates this method by adding juniper berries and oak staves at different points in the brewing process. The result is a 7 percent ABV beer reminiscent of a rye saison that vaguely reminds you of gin. If you’re near Chicago, this one should be fairly easy to find, but if you’re not it’s still worth asking around for—Off Color now distributes to 26 states. If you have a brew you’d like considered for Pick Six, send us an email at avclubbeer@gmail.com.

The banksters are back Posted on April 3, 2017March 31, 2017 by GS Early Views: 961 16 Shares It should come as no surprise that a guy from New York City, who has run a major global real estate development business, knows more than a few well-placed bankers. And when that guy becomes president of the United States, it’s his chance to give them their due. Now, before you get your hackles up, this isn’t a Trump-bashing piece. All presidents come to Washington and end up helping their state’s businesses. Reagan’s defense and anti-ballistic missile defense system build-up helped many of the aerospace companies and computer firms in his home state of California. Clinton helped make Tyson Foods one of the biggest chicken producers in the world. And Wal-Mart was also a big beneficiary of Clinton largesse. So it comes as no surprise that Wall Street has unpacked its bags on Pennsylvania Avenue. Like the former CIO of Goldman Sachs as Secretary of Treasury. Lose the middlemen Still in denial about the bankers having a heyday in DC as well as NYC? Here are the six-month returns of some of the top banksters that ushered in the financial crisis and were bailed out by you and me: Goldman Sachs: 44 percent JPMorgan Chase: 34 percent Wells Fargo: 27 percent Morgan Stanley: 36 percent Citigroup: 29 percent The S&P 500: 9 percent These big banks have outperformed the broad market 3- to 5- fold since the election. And it’s no coincidence. But this isn’t about morality. It’s about business. Actually, I’m kind of glad we’ve gotten rid of some of the ossified political hacks that were the middlemen for their corporate overlords and now we’re dealing directly with the overlords. At least it’s a change of pace. Investing is about performance. It’s about understanding what’s happening, regardless of your politics or desires and objectively observing what is going on. And then finding the opportunity there. That’s what I’m doing here. Do I like the debt-driven culture these banks have promoted? No. Are they a buying opportunity? Yes. But I think there is a better place to go with your investment dollars in this sector. Regional banks. Why regional banks? Because now that the banks are on their feet again and regulations will be in limbo for years to come, they have the chance to start blowing up the next big bubble. And I’m guessing that will be consolidating all the healthy, conservative regional and local banks. You see, the smaller banks weren’t the ones that caused the financial meltdown. They weren’t the ones lending to credit risks on one side of the trade while bundling those risks, selling them off and then shorting them on the other. Regional banks lend to local businesses, homeowners and individuals. They don’t have an arbitrage desk or a trading division. They make money the old way – pennies on the dollar, over and over again. For the “banksters,” as Bob Livingston calls them, they represent piggy banks full of responsible cash that will help their balance sheets (and stocks). It will also help the big boys leverage those assets into more trading money for their institutional side. Remember, the big banks cut their trading operations significantly once the bottom fell out of the global economy. But those days are gone and it’s back to business as usual, better business than usual. This is also a great opportunity to consolidate the banking landscape. If they gobble up enough smaller players around the country, they also rebuild their Too Big To Fail size while also becoming major players in small towns and big cities across America. Think about it like the auto industry. Here is a list of the defunct car companies in the U.S. that have been culled into the Big Three. Top targets Before I get to my investment picks, I want to say that the biggest statement you can make against the banksters is to move your business to smaller banks. I stopped using big banks decades ago and I have never felt cheated at keeping them as far away from my money as possible. Two other attractive qualities to regional bank stocks: Even if they’re not acquired, they’re still the best way to invest in the financial sector in the long term. If they are bought out, they will command big premiums, meaning big payoffs for investors. Without further ado, four solid stocks to look at are, BB&T, Fifth Third Bancorp, U.S. Bancorp and Burke & Herbert Bank and Trust. All these are rock-solid regional banks that will prosper on their own or profit handsomely from any takeover. — GS Early This entry was posted in Financial Foresight and tagged Bank.

Planning a vacation? Check out the best travel deals and destinations Opinion Commentary: Power to public-school principals, not Betsy DeVos’ protesters Education Secretary Betsy DeVos visits Valencia College in Osceola County U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos has made her first solo trip out of Washington D. C. and went to Osceola County to tour the Valencia College campus. U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos has made her first solo trip out of Washington D. C. and went to Osceola County to tour the Valencia College campus. Guest Columnist Privacy Policy Extended plane trips can confer a unique opportunity in the human experience: completely candid discussions with a neighbor/passenger. Knowing the visit is finite might help seatmates comfortably spill otherwise vulnerable thoughts the pursuit of the grandest phenomenon in life, the truth. Recently I enjoyed just that — a refreshingly open discussion with a trial attorney — on board a 747. As the flight bore on, in our amicable and forthright dialogue, he made an outright confession: Not many trial attorneys are friendly to our president, and this fellow was no exception. But in a moment of rhetorical disarmament, he acknowledged that Donald Trump uttered a profundity at his recent State of the Union address: “Education reform is the civil-rights issue of this generation.” Not allowing a disadvantaged mother the choice of sending her child to the school where she best sees fit is morally reprehensible. Then he said it. He actually implicated the teachers unions for their chokehold on Democrats, not permitting their captors the liberty to vote their conscience. I nearly fell into the aisle. I then collected myself and did my part with a vulnerable deposit to the dialogue: Free markets, when legal boundaries are well marked and enforced, have done more to elevate humanity than any government initiative. Walmart has done more for the poor than any other entity. Trump’s early inclinations to be a protectionist rankle libertarians. Said differently, protectionist policies raise costs. Moreover, Trump passed over free-market gurus for top spots in the administration, favoring Wall Street ilk instead. “Disappointing,” I offered to the curious attorney. Back to education. Over the last eight years, the federal government has poured hundreds of billions into public schools. And yet our public school students are not learning more. Enter Betsy DeVos, change agent on behalf of the children, for school choice. Her recent Central Florida appearances at St. Andrew Catholic School in Pine Hills with Trump, and at Valencia College, were the sounding bell for education transformation. One of the things she ought to do is more fully engage and empower principals of public schools. Ever notice how athletic coaches in sports and CEOs in business get so much attention? It’s because the effectiveness of any organization can appropriately be rolled up to the one individual in charge. He/she sets the culture, which sets results. Bill Belichek for the dynastic New England Patriots; Steve Jobs for iconic Apple; Oprah for Harpo Inc. Yet in recent memory, principals have been given short shrift within our national dialogue about childhood learning. They matter. Principals need more power. In last year’s Teacher’s Plus poll, nearly 75 percent of public school principals in California admitted to having to fire a young teacher, who was more qualified, rather than a senior teacher. Do you hear that nonsense? It’s called Last One In, First One Out, and it must stop, in the name of common sense. LIFO is a swamp gadget, designed by teachers’ unions, to keep backwater in place, undrained. The attorney sipped his club soda, nodding in agreement. Bob McClure, president of Florida’s free-market think tank, the James Madison Institute, puts it this way:“Hire great principals, pay them well, give them the tools to do their jobs and then get out of their way. Americans will be positively amazed at how quickly students start learning more.” Consider asking your local public school principal this question: “If you could wave a reasonable magic wand, what would you ask for, to enable your students to learn more?” If you receive a response that is less than inspiring and august, like I did, then something’s wrong — the consequences of which we’ll continue to endure. Also consider watching the movie, “Lean on Me.” Morgan Freeman’s performance is powerful as a struggling public school principal; the message is illustrative of the important theme our secretary of education should expound upon. Finally, I studied the face of a recent protester, standing in front of DeVos' vehicle, prohibiting her entry to hold office Day 1 and make change. It appeared the individual enjoyed being the victim of the situation, as handcuffs were appropriately affixed. I asked my temporary companion, who also vividly remembered the incident, "Was that protester really for the children?" Wryly, he smiled back. We then said goodbye. John L.

Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8+ U.S. pricing, availability, and offers Jordan Palmer Follow View All Posts 2017/03/29 10:34am PDTMar 29, 2017 11 Plus 1 on G+ 36 Share on Facebook 42 Share on Twitter Total Shares89 AT&T Cricket Wireless Galaxy S8 MetroPCS News Samsung Sprint T-Mobile US Cellular Verizon Wireless Videos Article Contents 1 Carriers 1.1 AT&T 1.2 Sprint 1.3 T-Mobile 1.4 U.S. Cellular 1.5 Verizon 2 Retail 2.1 Best Buy The Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8+ are finally official, after months of leaks, speculation, and rumors. The phone seems like more than just another iterative step for good ol' Sammy, what with the shift to softkeys for navigation (finally), the new screen aspect ratio, and so on. But as exciting as all of this is, I am certain that those of you who are interested in either phone will want to know where, when, and for how much you can pick one up. Luckily, we've compiled a nice list for you. Before we get started, here's the official blurb from Samsung: "In the U.S., the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ will be available in Midnight Black, Orchid Gray and Arctic Silver. Pre-orders for both Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ will begin at 12:01 EDT on March 30, 20173. AT&T, Cricket Wireless, Sprint, Straight Talk Wireless, T-Mobile, U.S. Cellular, and Verizon Wireless will carry the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ in stores beginning April 21. In addition, the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ will be available at all Best Buy stores as well as BestBuy.com, ShopSamsung app, Target and Walmart." Carriers Most of the carriers have chimed in at this point, although we are still missing information from Cricket and Straight Talk. We'll keep you updated as we learn more. AT&T The blue carrier has announced its pricing and availability for the S8. Pre-orders open tomorrow, March 30, and there are a few pricing options. AT&T Next customers can get the smaller phone for $25 per month, or the larger for $28.34 per month — both for 30-month terms.That, taking into account the 0% APR, brings the final retail price to $750 and $852 respectively, excluding taxes (which are due at the time of sale). In addition, Next customers are also eligible for the following promotions: Up to $750 in bill credits toward another S8/S8+ The new Gear VR controller and Oculus content bundle A Gear S3 for $49 with a two-year contract A Galaxy Tab E or Gear S2 for $0.99 with a two-year contract AT&T also mentions that Samsung's newest devices will be the first ones to take advantage of the carrier's "5G Evolution Markets" program. The Galaxy S8 and S8+ are expected to be available on April 21. Sprint Sprint's pre-orders begin tomorrow, March 30th, including the same three colors as the other US carriers, along with the Gear VR bundle. You can also choose to upgrade to the Gear VR "Experience" bundle that includes a set of premium on-ear headphones and a 256GB memory card along with the Gear VR pack. Sprint will offer the S8 for $31.25 per month for 18 months on lease, and the S8+ will be $35.42 for the same 18 months. Sprint adds that Boost and Virgin will stock the standard S8 starting on April 21st. Sprint's standard retail price for the S8 and S8+ will be $750 and $850, respectively. T-Mobile Team Magenta, on the other hand, released plenty of details for the S8, pricing, and network capabilities (what's a Tmo press release without the company talking about its network?). Customers can pre-order Samsung's latest at 9:01pm PT tonight, March 29. Both phones can be had for $30/month on the Equipment Installment Plan for 24 months. The catch is that the S8 requires $30 (plus taxes) down initially, whereas the S8+ requires $130 down. That makes the phones $750 and $850 respectively when all is said and done. Pre-orderers will also score the new Gear VR controller and Oculus content bundle for free. T-Mobile is also hyping up its new network technology, where the S8 will be the first to take advantage of a trifecta of stuff. I don't want to spoil your experience reading up on it, so be sure to check out the source links at the end of the post. MetroPCS customers can also take advantage of the pre-order freebies. The Galaxy S8 and S8+ are supposed to launch on April 21. U.S. Cellular The underdog of the bunch, U.S. Cellular is also getting in on the new Galaxy goodness. Where this carrier is hoping to stand out is that customers can get the S8/S8+ for nothing down (with qualifying trade-in) — if you don't have such a device and want a new Galaxy S8, the company will give a you a $100 promo card. As for pricing, U.S. Cellular's press release doesn't actually specify what customers will pay. Though, if my calculator skills prove correct, I'd bet around $31/mo for the S8 and $35/mo for the S8+, assuming 0% APR and no down payment. Like its competitors, U.S. Cellular is giving its customers a Gear VR controller bundle for free if they pre-order between tomorrow, March 30, and April 20. I think it's pretty safe to assume that the phones will be available on April 21. U.S. Cellular reached out to us to offer a correction to the original press release. Only the Galaxy S8 will be "free," but the S8+ will cost $3.64 per month on a 30-month "retail installment contract." You can find the updated press release here or at the updated U.S. Cellular source link at the bottom of the post. Verizon We round out our carrier list with Verizon. Big Red is offering the Galaxy S8 and S8+ to Unlimited customers for $15/month for 24 months, 0% APR, with an eligible device trade-in. In short, that's a very good deal. Pre-orderers can choose between two additional options: 1) The new Gear VR controller and Oculus content bundle for free, or 2) the Experience Box, which includes the aforementioned free bundle plus a pair of Harman Kardon headphones and a 256GB microSD card, for $99. If you don't have a qualifying device for trade-in, then you'll need to pay $30 per month for the S8 ($720 final) or $35 per month for the S8+ ($840 final). Overall, Verizon has some of the better pricing for Samsung's new flagships. Both phones will be available on April 21. Retail There will be a few retail stores (besides the obvious carrier ones) where you can purchase a Galaxy S8 or S8+. Right now, we only have information from Best Buy, but you can also expect some news from Target and Walmart in the near future. Best Buy There isn't much to say with the electronics retailer, other than it is taking pre-orders for the S8/S8+ starting tomorrow. Like with Verizon, pre-orderers can get the Gear VR controller and Oculus content bundle for free or the Experience Box for $99. Best Buy is also offering Geek Squad Complete Protection (i.e. insurance) in case your phone breaks or something. Also be checking the stores and the website for cases, accessories, and whatnot.

Just buy the thing outright and save yourself a ton of dough in the long run. Cellphone Chris How is it any cheaper to do that? The carriers will allow you to buy outright as well - it's not like they charge interest on the installment plans. ddevito Right - then why use the carrier at all then? Suicide_Note The carrier versions have actually been getting updated quicker than the unlocked US models. Plus, the carriers offer easy installment plans. ddevito Okay, that's a good reason I guess. That's insane to me but I'm not disagreeing with you. Suicide_Note I agree. One would think the unlocked models would be updated faster, but unfortunately that hasn't been the case lately. Adil Tajgeer this. and with the phone launching on 7.0 instead of 7.1 i don't see samsung actually updating this round of unlocked phones in the US any faster. (the unlocked US model STILL doesn't have Nougat when all US carrier models do.) Jay Quir I dont beleive the unlocked model best buy will be selling will be the u.s. version. It will probably be a international one instead. Can't remember which international version the black s7 was though Adil Tajgeer I didn't think best buy sold international models, the s7 was a us unlocked model. But it would be better if they sold the intl ones since they seem to get better support. Jay Quir Yea they sold two versions of the gs7 one was the silver u.s. unlocked and the black international. I ended up taking back the black one due to not having samsung pay at the time ( I got way too used to Samsung Pay) now that samsung pay seems to be available in all countries ( I beleive) that shouldnt be a problem with the s8/s8 +. Although the international version s7 could not receive best buy geek squad protection. Jay Quir Yup still waiting for it, bet anything they wont update it until a month or so or the day of the s8 launch. Jay Quir Best buy up charges the unlocked models yet give you so many months to pay for it. All depends on how bad you dont want that carrier logo 😂 Suicide_Note Best Buy has the unlocked S8+ for $825, which is $25 cheaper than the carriers. Jay Quir Nice! Before they used to up charge the price. Still have to wait a month later but not that bad of a wait blueman24 Why would anyone who cares about updates buy a samsung phone in the first place? Doby Gillis Choice. Look up the definition if it confuses you. ddevito But won't you have more choices if bought outright? Adil Tajgeer i'm not sure i'm following your argument. what extra choices would you have in buying the unlocked model? as for cost, BYOD nets you the same discount as using an EIP on the major carriers, so you don't save anything on your bill. i can see if you want to use an MVNO and their service/price is a better option, but if one is happy with what they are getting service wise from a major carrier, there is no real benefit to buying a phone outright. if there is, please enlighten me, because i truly can't see the benefit. ddevito yes, more choice as in carriers. MVNOs use the same networks and are way cheaper. So I don't see YOUR point Adil Tajgeer MVNOs don't always offer the right service packages for everyone. if an MVNO works for you, then it's great as you can potentially save $20-30 a month, but if it doesn't and you're using a major carrier anyways, then there is really no reason to buy the phone outright. ddevito Okay, but you kind of said the same thing I did. Adil Tajgeer the issue is that MVNOs aren't a good deal for everyone. sometimes the plan offered by the major carrier works better for the user, and in that case, the EIP makes far more sense than buying the phone outright. everyone should shop around to see what works for them, being on a major carriers plan JUST to be able to get the phone in installments is a bad idea for sure. Michael2011 Just pay the damn thing off and free up your monthly income. You're essentially financing a phone and getting into debt. Debt is risk. Adil Tajgeer You're not spending any more or less money total either way. A fixed loan at 0% interest is not the same thing as a credit card, nor is it as dangerous. Michael2011 Lol. My friends who think like you are basically broke and better hope they stay in good health. Their monthly income is tied up in 0% fixed loans. One catastrophic event and they're bankrupt. Adil Tajgeer Sorry your friends have no idea how to manage their finances. Michael2011 Yup. As well as most Americans who believe debt (a fixed rate of 0% is still debt) is normal and acceptable. The problem is it ties up their income and introduces stress and risk because life happens (unexpected financial burdens). It's always best to save up and pay for toys in full. Michael2011 As well as many in countries where financing every little thing is normal. Have fun with your debt/liability. Adil Tajgeer I will, because the $30 a month is not going to break my budget. I know how to manage my money. Thanks! Michael2011 Sure you do. Keep living the debt life. Adil Tajgeer Keep living that judge life. You don't know me man, so kindly piss off with your judgement. Michael2011 You mad bro? Adil Tajgeer Nah, it really doesn't matter to me. ddevito Exactly. It's astonishing how dumb people are with money. Cellphone Chris I agree that updates are more timely. Also, why invest the capital up front when you don't need to? It's the same benefit of leasing a car - Controlled expense and the ability to upgrade more frequently - By the time your manufacturer's warranty is set to expire, you've most likely moved on to a newer device. ddevito Right, and I see your point of view with the warranty. But owning it outright gives you more choice and more flexibility with the device itself and the carrier it operates on. Yes, controlled expenses work when the total assets total much more than we have in our bank accounts (why mortgages exist, and car payments) but a < $1000 piece of equipment shouldn't have this much control of your expenses. It's ludicrous Cellphone Chris I agree with your assessment if the ability to switch carriers adds value for you. I've been very satisfied with mine, so I tend to lean the other way. Dllemm Except Sprint doesn't work with Verizon doesn't work with AT&T. And sim card locks. Justin W On top of that, with the value of money decreasing over time (inflation), paying $30/mo is better in the long-run with 0% interest than paying all of it down now, though of course this depends on whether or not you could/will invest the remaining amount in an investment that will be a net positive when considering inflation rate. MJ I don't know where you live but inflation is "low" in the US so that is not really a factor on "small" purchases like this. Saying that, I wouldn't ever buy a carrier phone nor want to be committed to service for the long term. This is ignoring the fact, that personally ,I could pay the balance immediately). niuguy Time value of money....$1 now is more valuable than $1 in a year. Inflation is only one component in that equation. MJ What? Time is a factor but NOT over two years for the amount in question. Again, inflation has been irrelevant for years now and the American dollar stable for even longer. The argument makes sense if purchasing a car or house but NOT a phone. Justin W I'd agree it's not a significant factor, but the value of money over time decreases in this economy. That may change, but typically it doesn't, but if we're looking at efficiency, that is probably the best way to do if you don't mind having a slightly higher monthly payment. As @niuguy:disqus said, the money is more valuable now than it will be in a month, a year, two years, etc. and that applies to pretty much everything. Defenestratus Believe it or not, many American's cannot find an emergency $500 if it came down to it. The smartest thing they did is release this around tax refund season since that is likely the only way a lot of people will be able to afford this handset at full retail. ddevito I agree with you, but it's so sad Maha Rashtrian Tax season point covered. Michael2011 Those people have no business buying a $750+ phone then. Adil Tajgeer if you're happy with your carrier, i don't see the issue with the EIP, it's a 0% interest loan and you need a carrier to use the phone anyways. if you are unhappy with service you can pay it off and move on, they will unlock the phone if its paid off, and with the verizon models they're unlocked anyways. i'd rather keep my money liquid than dump it all in a phone for no actual benefit. ddevito I don't mean to sound like an elitist, but having a "liquid" $800 isn't going to make or break you, and if you do your homework you will realize you will save money in the long run, thus being more "liquid" in the long run. I can understand expensive home appliances such as a furnace or roof, or a car payment, but not a smartphone. Adil Tajgeer that only works if you find an MVNO that is acceptable to you in terms of service for the price. metroPCS is $60 to get even close to the plan i have with tmo for $70, and they will still cap you at a far lower amount than tmo straighttalk is the same and will also cap you at a low amount same with mint so you have more options and can potentially save some money, but you also are getting less for that savings. i'll take my 30gb soft cap before throttling, unlimited international roaming, more tethering allowance, and other random perks for the $10-15 more a month. i get that $800-1000 isn't a ton of money, but i have yet to find an MVNO that really offers me much more for my money, and if one is on a major provider already then there is no benefit to sinking any amount of cash for no gain. ddevito I pay $55/month for Straight Talk on AT&T's network for 10GB. It's a great deal and I'm not capped until I reach the 10GB. Not sure what low amount you're referring to. Adil Tajgeer i pay $70 for unlimited on tmobile and i'm not capped until 30. being that i regularly use 15-20gb a month on average, the 10gb caps don't work for me, especially for the $15 in savings. plus their international roaming is a livesaver and has saved me a considerable amount of money traveling. most MVNOs at the 50+ price range will give you 10GB of data. if someone's usage is below 10GB (even more so if they use less than 6GB) MVNOs offer a good value, but if you use a lot of data (especially if you use more than 10GB) there is little benefit gained by using an MVNO. that is the crux of my argument, if you are happy with what you are getting from a major carrier, and MVNOs don't offer you what you need from a provider, then there is no benefit from buying the phone outright versus an EIP. if a new MVNO pops up, or offers a new plan that works better, simply paying off the phone you have will let you jump ship to them and you will be out the same money you would have been if you had bought it outright in the first place. niuguy The time value of money (TVM) is the idea that money available at the present time is worth more than the same amount in the future due to its potential earning capacity. This core principle of finance holds that, provided money can earn interest, any amount of money is worth more the sooner it is received. rockstarr27 The price isn't the issue, t-mobile is $750 with only $30 monthly payments, no interest, so you're actually saving money since it's still $750 in the future even when inflation has devalued your money. The real carrier scam is carrier lock-in. ddevito Okay, sure, but that's just T-Mobile. Unless you live in a metro area their coverage is miserable. MadMartigan "Unless you live in a metro area their coverage is miserable." So the LTE in my hometown is imaginary? Cool... ddevito TMO coverage is awful in the majority of the US, I'm happy you have coverage, good for you. MadMartigan "TMO coverage is awful in the majority of the US" Right, right. Obviously. /s ddevito If their coverage was decent they'd have a ton more customers. Surely you can't really believe it's that good can you? Trust me I hope I'm wrong but I know I'm not. I would love to be able to use them, but it's never going to happen. MadMartigan Wireless customers: Verizon Wireless: 145.7 million (Q4 2016) AT&T Mobility: 135 million (Q4 2016) T-Mobile US: 71.5 million (Q4 2016) Out of curiosity, exactly how many customers do they need to be considered to have "decent coverage"? ddevito Misleading stat - they're a metro based carrier. MadMartigan Ah. Well then. I guess that's that. DKBNYC How is having to pay off the phone a termination fee? You agreed to buy the phone at a set price. They were kind enough to let you do that over a set number of months. You decided 10 months in that you no longer want to use the service. Well you agreed to pay for a phone. Shouldn't you have to pay what you owe on your phone? " It isn't hard math to do once you realize how much dough you actually save with a sim-only/MVNO, etc." Didn't you have to buy a phone to use this? Whats the difference? tim242 It's the same price either way. ddevito For the phone, yes. But for service included, not even close. tim242 That has nothing to do with the price of the phone througj the carrier. ddevito I never said it did. But read your bill, you're paying for that phone whether you realize it or not. You simply want to troll and argue, but you're not doing a sufficient job keeping your argument going. I also added the cost of the service to my original point. In the long run you're paying more, it's a simple fact. You like paying more? Good for you, capitalism loves people like you. tim242 I don't know where you reside, but US carriers removed subsidies years ago. ddevito Yes. But you're still paying for it. But you're a troll, I get it. I'm moving on. MadMartigan "it's the same price either way" now equals trolling? I must have missed that memo - or the part where he made any kind of claim as to not "still paying for it"... tim242 I'm a troll for proving you wrong. Ok. ddevito Since you always need to get the last word in, I'm replying again. tim242 Blocked. yardie good luck buying a phone with no service what a tool ddevito Lots of people do, it's buying it unlocked. Are you new? TechGuy22 no, you end up paying more in long run tim242 What are you talking about? The S8 is $720 full retail on Verizon, or $30 per month for 24 months. That is $720 either way. yardie stop smoking crack bruh youre so stupid. please learn basic Math ddevito Read your carrier bill, do the math. It's quite simple, you pay more in the long run. Benedict Weren't carrier phones also optimized for their specific network? ddevito Perhaps, but I don't believe that's the case with recent phones, but I can be wrong. Paco Inurreta I pay the same montly fee with my carrier with a phone or without it. Buying the phone from my carrier gives me 50% off the total phone price in a 24 month contract which I already use with or without a contract. So no, is not a scam if you know what the heck is up! Brendan Sprint seems to be offering a Gear VR with controller, content bundle, and an exclusive "Platinum Experience with Samsung Rewards". Cakefish UK pricing: S8: £689 S8+: £779 S7 series launch day pricing for comparison: S7: £569 (S8 is 21% more expensive) S7 edge: £639 (S8+ is 22% more expensive) Conclusion: thanks Brexit :( Moeen Ahmed Any VR headset available with pre orders? Checked Samsung and Carphone and neither seemed to offer VR headset. Christopher Bailey (Xcom923) you need to look at https://samsungpromotions.com/ X-47B You can't compare directly like that. You have to take into account inflation and base storage as well. Check prices against 64GB S7. Cakefish Yep, UK inflation is the highest it's been for years. I wonder why? Because Brexit. Samsung didn't sell 64GB S7 in UK by the way, only 32GB, so that comparison is moot. PC_Peasant’s number 1 fan S8 is more expensive in general too. Us TRUE €UROPEANS are gonna get fked too. Mike Marshall President of MSN!, is giving advice individuals to start "Work at home" method, that Loads of marketers have been doing more than a year now.

This is how i started >> http://adultadda.net/2Xk StopBeingOffendedDERP ridiculous blaming it on Brexit. Please, continue being a slave to a non-UK nation controlling who can enter your country and take jobs, vs. UK leaders. Cakefish Ridiculous eh? What caused the pound to drop considerably in value vs the US dollar in the last 12 months? Thereby making imported goods considerably more expensive. The Brexit referendum result. Francisco Peña Brexit happened 9 months ago. Maybe the pound dropped because the markets knew that Obama would finally leave and praise the banks that he did. StopBeingOffendedDERP The vote happened - the actual exit will take planning. Francisco Peña Should have been clearer.. yes, the actual thing won't happen until 2 yrs from now, I meant the referendum, was 9 months ago, but that basically set the wheels moving. My point wasn't to blame Brexit (referendum or otherwise) entirely as it was more the US markets increasing due to Obama leaving... Cakefish Brexit didn't happen 9 months ago, the referendum did. Article 50 was only just triggered today. So there's still roughly 2 years before the UK is officially out of the EU. And what does the former US president's term coming to an end have to do with the currency of the UK? Francisco Peña That's what I meant.. the vote... which led to 9 months later May invoking Article 50. Brexit officially won't happen for 2 yrs, but for all intents and purposes, the referendum started it. StopBeingOffendedDERP As noted, Brexit would cause economic impact when first implemented. That would be 'short term'. If I were told 'merge with Mexico and Canada, let them dictate social, economic and trade policies, be powerless regarding who has essentially free reign to enter and hold jobs', I would gladly pay more money for luxury items. I guess that is my ultimate point. Overall, Brexit WILL be good for the UK and bad for the EU. Paying less to lose sovereignty is totally independence, IMHO. Cakefish They say 'short term' but this period of extreme economic uncertainty will last a minimum of another two years (until UK officially leaves the EU) and possibly many more as trade deals between nations often take many years to finalise and Scotland will try and break away again as soon as they can hold another independence referendum.

Synacks When Verizon means trade-in up top, do they mean existing customer trade-in as in Edge-Up? Or do they mean new customers trading in a device from another carrier? Corey W. Trading in any device, but it must be paid off entirely. tim242 They have the yearly upgrade now. They pay off the last half with your trade-in. But you have to have one of the devices from the last year or two that qualifies.

I've looked it up twice now to make sure. They are 5 dollars on T-Mobile, and possibly other carriers, but not the death star. Averix Please include the stupid upgrade fees in this pricing. Verizon's cost isn't so attractive when you tack on a useless $30 fee to each phone that has no clear value. MadMartigan T-Mobile is doing this now as well, but I don't remember the exact total of the "upgrade fee".... Lame. dabug91 $30 is what it was years ago. Isn't it $40 now? Averix Pretty sure it's still $30. A few years ago, the fee only applied to contract upgrades. If you were off contract, there was no fee. Then they made the fee mandatory for all. A $30 fee for me to swap a SIM chip ON MY OWN. If they want to charge an in-store setup fee of $30 for people that can't figure out what they're doing, fine. But making me pay a nebulous fee with 0 tangible benefit to me just makes me irritated. Aaron Did you call them first before SIM swapping? I mean if you are buying a new phone through them I can see where they have you but I have never noticed a charge when SIM swapping between phones myself. Of course Verizon tells you that you can't, but I've never noticed any issues afterward. dabug91 Well it was $40 even two years ago. It started at $30 in 2012, went to $35, and then $40, and now it's back down to $30. https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/01/verizon-raises-upgrade-fee-to-cover-increased-cost-but-its-costs-declined/ Ryan Cottrell Just do it on Verizonwireless.com and they usually waive the fee Averix No, they don't anymore. They used to online for full price buys, but it's locked in as part of the sale now. You may be able to get it waived if you call, but I wouldn't hold my breath. Ryan Cottrell It must just be a sales promotion thing now. When I got on 4 days ago it said it would be waived but not today. Probably because they know they'll make a killing off the pre-orders. Maybe it'll be back sometime before shipment day AbbyZFresh Samsung fans will be able to satisfy their burning desire for a new Galaxy product. It's gonna blow up the smartphone market.

Good_Ole_Pinocchio I mean it's fully unlocked and has the bands for all carriers...... But the unlocked S7 still doesn't have nougat....So theres that. Leonardo Baez You will get updates faster on an unlocked device than a carrier one Good_Ole_Pinocchio No. The US Unlocked models still don't have nougat. All the carrier variants do. Leonardo Baez I bet you that will be an upgrade OTA on the first week after unboxing it Good_Ole_Pinocchio Bro I'm taking about the unlocked S7 from last year lol. Daniel Tiberius Yeah that used to be the case but not anymore. :-( Mike O Probably the best... but those are looking at a May release. Eddy Nelson Lopez Look at the model number, if it ends with the letter U do not buy it if you care about software updates, if the variant ends with the F then do buy it, that's the best variant to receive Software updates and rhe Fastest thanks to the exynos processor. Eddy Nelson Lopez Is this the unlocked version finishing with a letter X like they did with the poor S7 that does not even have 7.0 yet or That's the the one finishing with the letter F AKA the best variant to buy and exynos variant? Good_Ole_Pinocchio The "U" model is the US Model that doesn't have Nougat. Don't think there's an X model. Best Buy used to sell the F International model but I don't think they do anymore since the U model became a thing last year. Eddy Nelson Lopez You're right, the U is the bad variant, the X is the variant they use for Demo purposes at the stores. Leonardo Baez Quick and dirty preview from Casey Neistat.

Plus, the new rumors of the OnePlus 5 having an edge variant has me curious. Seeing as OPO phones are kind of the new Nexus phones these days. Vivek Rameses When does opo release their devices? dblock Just doing a quick search on the release dates for the OPO 2 and 3, looks like the summer months is when they typically release new devices. So, hopefully we can expect to seem some details soon on a device from them, with a release in June or July. Dllemm S8 plus? I had to double check, but it looks like they're ripping off Apple's naming scheme now? Cakefish What suffix or prefix would you give the larger model? Daniel Tiberius Ultra!! Cakefish That has been 'claimed' by HTC though ;) Mike O Venti? Dllemm XL or Pro or Edge or something their #1 direct competitor didn't just started using. Suresh Aryal There was Galaxy S2 plus years before iPhone plus. AQ Samsung previously used + on the S6 for the larger screen version (S6, S6 Edge & S6 Edge+) because you could get a 5.1 inch S6 with the Edge screen back then. Dllemm It would help their credibility if (A) they were upfront about pricing and (B) acknowledge that most people use phone cases in their marketing and build the back of their phones more rigid.

Both the progressive pro-immigrant and rightwing anti-immigration parties and movements propose easy answers and attack their adversaries with political invective. Both left and right engage in a losing war, based on historical omissions, abstract and muddle-headed assumptions and destructive proposals. I will proceed by outlining a framework to understand the political, economic and security implications, which form the centerpiece for confronting immigration. The Past and the Present A serious discussion of immigration begins by focusing on the centrality of time and place, encouraging the flow and absorption of immigrants. In the past, immigration flourished during periods when countries experienced: (1) rapid productive growth; (2)increasing labor demand; (3) trade unions and organizations capable of integrating new (immigrant) workers and protecting the on-going wage rates and conditions for all; (4) cross sectoral labor co-operation and solidarity lowering conflict between immigrant and native workers; (5) inclusive, equitable welfare programs; (6) local, not global wars and (7) violence confined outside of the US and the EU. During these periods, most immigration was confined within Europe and North America or between them. These conditions could not eliminate competition and conflict but they limited its nature and time frame and allowed for successful integration. If these conditions formed the basis for relatively peaceful immigration, their absence has intensified conflict amidst an increased flow of immigrants. This process has produced deep political problems. Progressives, who cite past ‘Ellis-Island’ type immigration experience and ignore the unfavorable current socio-economic conditions, are in denial. They dismiss the vast socio-economic and political changes, which have occurred and which make the absorption of new waves of immigrants extremely difficult. Mass Immigration and Imperial Wars The vast majority of refugees today are on the move because of Western wars. These wars are ‘total’ wars, designed to obliterate civilian, as well as military institutions and structures. In the last two decades, the US and EU have launched seven wars devastating the lives of once-cohesive and productive families, their homes and farms, jobs, institutions and security. Millions have been driven into exile. The vast majority of new immigrants are refugees from countries targeted by the US-EU and their suffering has no visible end. During and after the Second World War, refugees suffered greatly, but were generally absorbed or repatriated and integrated into re-constructing their homes and societies. These favorable transitions were aided by an acute post-war labor shortage (over 40 million, mostly men, were killed in WWII) and the economic demands of post-war reconstruction. Western peace movements in the post-WWII past were effective and succeeded in limiting the scope and length of wars. Such peace movements no longer exist. Wars today are designed to be endless and total – in terms of the destruction of civilian infrastructure and national institutions. Over the past 2 decades, the peace movements have disappeared. This is largely because the US and EU increasingly rely on the use of devastating bombing campaigns by their air and naval forces, which sharply limit Western casualties. Most anti-war movements were sustained by domestic anger at their own soldiers returning in ‘body bags’. Current domestic economic conditions have sharply deteriorated. Capitalist regimes have imposed brutal economic policies increasing unemployment and low paying temporary job. Joblessness approaches 50% among young workers in Southern Europe – regions flooded with desperate refugees. Moreover imperial policies have shifted steadily to increased military spending for wars while imposing austerity measures, slashing social programs at home. In this context, new immigrants, especially refugees from imperial wars, compete for diminishing public resources and drastically reduced wages. Their competition effectively drives down the wages for all workers – sharply increasing the conditions for brutal exploitation. The intense competition over jobs between native workers and immigrants is the result of capitalist wars and deliberate domestic economic policies to pay for these wars. This creates greater insecurity and hastens the downward mobility experienced by workers and the lower middle class. In the past, such pressures and conditions led to workers protest, resistance and class conflict. Today, trade unions cease to unify old and new workers into a strong organized force to confront the worst excesses of capital. Trade union membership has declined precipitously. The union bosses have exchanged militancy and independence for self-serving alliances with capitalist politicians. Trade unions do not protect the basic interests of workers and their families – they follow the lead of the ‘progressive’ pro-immigrant parties which are an arm of the militarist capitalist ruling class. The workers are not racist when they resist further deterioration in their income and living standards: They are trying to protect their jobs, benefits and social programs for their families – in an environment of increasing insecurity and capitalist exploitation. In the recent past, workers could rely on stable jobs and increasing wages because of the strong manufacturing domestic economy. These same workers, who are now labelled as ‘racist’, generally accepted immigrant workers at their plants and in their neighborhoods and schools. But this was in the decades before droves of refugees and destitute immigrants fleeing US-EU wars and destruction came to be viewed as threats to their livelihoods and children’s future. Unlike the past, when international capital brought extracted raw materials back to the imperial country to be processed by local manufacturers, today US and EU multi-nationals have relocated their industries to overseas low wage countries, undermining jobs and living standards at home. Commercial importers and retailers, like Wal-Mart, re-employ the displaced workers with offers of minimum pay, no benefits and contingent work. ‘Free Trade’ is not really ‘trade: Rather it is the easy outflow of investment and jobs and the retention of profits overseas in tax-havens. US government-subsidized, high-tech corporate agro-exports have decimated ‘Third World’ farmers, forcing mass immigration of displaced peasants who then form a base to compete with domestic workers and lower the wages in the US and EU. Progressives falsely argue, ‘ex post facto’, that migrant have merely taken the poorly-paid, unpleasant jobs that local workers rejected. The reality is more complex: In a previous era, most immigrants quickly moved into decently-paid jobs and were generally accepted by US workers. Once, US meat packers were well-paid workers supported by militant unions. Over time, the unions lost key labor struggles and capitalists reduced wages, in some cases by fifty percent. What had once been well regulated and strictly protected workplaces deteriorated dramatically. This decline was accompanied by the influx and hiring of low wage immigrants from Mexico and Central America. Today, the meat packing industry is among the most dangerous work environment where even immigrant children are employed. The same pattern of deteriorating wages and conditions and replacement by immigrant labor has occurred in landscaping, construction, the garment industry, transport, retailing, plumbing etc. What has most recently pushed millions of young workers to migrate from their homes are the series of destructive imperial wars. These devastated the domestic security situation, erasing any functional national military and police structures as well as the possibilities for jobs and a stable future for young people. Former military commanders and soldiers, whose families have been torn apart by imperial US-EU wars and stripped of all dignity, have little choice but to join resistance fighters, such as ISIS in Iraq, or join the waves of refugees. The US and EU invasion forces and puppet regimes have systematically destroyed any secular, democratic, nationalist or socialist parties and movements in the targeted countries, in their drive to divide once cohesive nations into tribal client states. In their place, violent Islamist and ethnic resistance movements have sprung up to fight the invaders and their puppets. This is the natural and predictable result of the imperial policy of destroying modern states on a massive scale. Since multiple imperial wars in contiguous countries have destroyed all hope for refuge and new lives within the war-torn region, the new violent Islamist movements have adopted their own ‘international strategy’. Since the imperial wars were launched from distant imperial capitals in Washington, London and Paris, using bombs and missiles, the Islamists have little alternative but to base their military and terrorist strategies within civilian populations, leading to massive casualties. The violent jihadi attacks against civilian targets in the West are not specifically religious or directed at capturing economic resources or power. The objective is to gain political influence among the growing and marginalized immigrant population in Europe and to undermine the capacity and willingness of the EU and US to continue these endless wars. In the neglected immigrant neighborhood, there will be growing numbers of sympathizers for the ‘attackers’. This will increase demands by angry and frightened citizens in the West who have increasingly accepted the nationalist political solution of ‘draining the lake’ (immigrants) to catch the ‘fish’ (terrorists). Anti-immigrant politics and anti-terrorist police activities become inter-mingled with growing domestic economic insecurity and the sense of cultural and national displacement experienced by traditional homogeneous working class communities adjacent to large enclaves of immigrants. Increasingly severe ‘austerity’ policies, imposed by neo-liberal governments, greatly inflame the situation. The so-called, liberal pro-immigration parties and movements ignore the fragile socio-cultural fabric of the local communities. They have done little to protect vulnerable communities from capitalist policies of literally dumping immigrants into areas and regions which cannot support or absorb them. The political leaders of pro-immigrant parties are generally far from these communities and immune to growing competition for scarce jobs and resources. For many politicians, bureaucrats and even NGO administrators, ‘their immigrants’ are domestic workers, cooks, baby sitters, gardeners, who directly serve the most comfortable strata of society. In contrast, the masses of uprooted refugees and immigrants live close to local workers, compete for jobs and share crowded clinics, social services and schools – under conditions of increasing scarcity. The ruling class collaborates with highly domesticated trade union officials and certain ‘coopted’ second generation immigrant leaders to ‘pacify’ this domestic discontent through multi-cultural programs and mandatory diversity training sessions for workers and neighborhoods, without ever having to actually confront the class issues of deteriorating living standards and the loss of future job prospects for the children of local workers. Working and lower middle class communities will naturally close ranks on ethnic, regional and religious bases, because they lack principled class leaders. They are susceptible to the appeals of nationalist-populist or anti-immigrant leaders and politicians, despite these parties long association with the hard right. With the notable exception of French leader, Marine Le Pen, who skillfully combines a deep understanding of French socio-economic trends with her restrictive immigration policies, the majority of Western populist and anti-immigrant politicians channel the widespread resentment over downward mobility among native workers to blaming ‘the immigrants’. The virulent media attacks and charges of ‘racism’ made by liberal politicians and intellectuals against the downwardly mobile workers, who have been devastated by neo-liberal policies and the broad consequences of imperial wars, do nothing to combat imperialism and class exploitation. They certainly do not help the immigrants. Denunciations of the marginalized American workers and rural citizens, who voted for US President Donald Trump, by the middle class intellectuals, living in the more comfortable and urbanized coastal states, show a deep misunderstanding of the fundamental changes occurring in the country. In Europe and the US, employees and activists, connected to liberal NGOs, flock to immigrants like carrion birds, carving out their own little careers ‘educating’ immigrants and entreating the local residents of deteriorated neighborhoods to join in ’sharing’ the dominant ruling class-directed celebrations of ‘diversity’ ( or the ‘multi-culturalism of suffering’). Conclusion Immigration in the 21st century is significantly different from past waves of migrants. It is highly manipulative to compare the current displacement of millions of war refugees with ‘Ellis Island’ in the US or the post-WWII situation of massive reconstruction in Europe. Immigration today is a direct product of imperial wars, where murder, injury, terror and deliberate shredding of social institutions have forcibly displaced tens of millions of people – the immigrants. Meanwhile, in the imperial countries, crass capitalist exploitation, the export of capital and jobs, and austerity have aroused the anger of workers and lower middle class employees, whose living standards have sustained significant losses. The forced merger of two enormous waves – the millions of dispossessed refugees and migrants and the marginalized and increasingly threatened workers and citizens in the West has become the key focus of the deepening conflicts of capitalists and workers in the US and the EU. Progressives and reactionaries alike obfuscate the fundamental class issues by diverting public attention to the issue of ‘racism’ and ‘immigrants’. In the long run, the West must face this dangerous phenomenon by organizing broad and militant anti-imperial peace movements to prevent the wars that produce these waves of desperate migrants. Trade unions, co-operatives and local or national social movements must organize the under-employed, unemployed and underpaid workers to combat the loss of jobs, the pillage of national wealth, massive capitalist tax evasion and the de-industrialization of the national economy. Banks must be nationalized, and education and health care should be publically funded and replace the current massive public budgets for war. Immigrants, who decide to settle in their new countries, should seek to fully integrate, reject dual citizenship and dual loyalties and denounce organizations that act as “fifth columns” for overseas ethno-religious states of all persuasions. Uprooted people must ultimately choose to remain and fight over flight. They must engage in resistance to imperial occupations in their homelands instead of choosing abject submission and indignities abroad. The role of citizens in the West is to support these struggles by opposing the militarists among their own political leaders. There are no easy answers for mass migration but there are clear causes and proposals for the future. ← Media’s Orwellian Newspeak To Justify Violence – OpEd India In Africa: Can The Tortoise Catch Up? – Analysis → James Petras James Petras is the author of more than 62 books published in 29 languages, and over 600 articles in professional journals, including the American Sociological Review, British Journal of Sociology, Social Research, and Journal of Peasant Studies.

Vudu Disc-to-Digital goes mobile: scan your DVD collection and convert it to digital for a fee [Updated] Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/03/23 6:12am PDTMar 23, 2017 14 Plus 1 on G+ 92 Share on Facebook 36 Share on Twitter Total Shares142 Applications News Update 1: 2017/03/23 4:23pm PDT The app changelog is now up: WHAT'S NEW **Introducing Mobile Disc to Digital – Convert from your phone!** Use your mobile device to convert your Blu-ray and DVD discs into Vudu has offered a Disc-to-Digital service for a while for those who wanted to convert their physical DVD and Blu-Ray movie collection to digital. However, the service either required you to pop into a Walmart with all of your discs in hand or download the app on your computer and insert discs one by one to verify that you own them. Now, the option is available on mobile. Through an update to the Vudu app, which doesn't seem to be live yet, Vudu users will be able to scan the barcode off their DVDs and Blu-Rays and let the app offer them the digital version in return. There are a couple of catches though plus a fee to pay. First, the service only has about 8000 movies in the catalogue now, so you may run into one or many that aren't yet supported. For example, Disney's movies aren't available, but you shouldn't have problems with Lionsgate, Paramount, Sony Pictures, 20th Century Fox, Universal Pictures, or Warner Bros. Second, you have to physically be at your billing location because the app will request a GPS verification to make sure you're at home scanning your own collection and not strolling through a store and scanning everything on the shelves. Third, there's a limit of 100 titles per year per account, which seems like a reasonable way to avoid potential abuse from those who manage to get around the location limitation. As for the price, it costs $2 to convert a DVD to SD or a Blu-Ray to HD, but $5 to upgrade a DVD to HD. One complimentary conversion will be offered for Vudu users to try out the service. If neither the catches or prices turned you off, the feature should go live today so keep your eye on an update to the Vudu app if you're interested. Update 1: 2017/03/23 4:23pm PDT The app changelog is now up: WHAT'S NEW **Introducing Mobile Disc to Digital – Convert from your phone!** Use your mobile device to convert your Blu-ray and DVD discs into digital movies! Upgrade your app and convert your collection today! • It’s easy! Scan the UPC, convert with a click, and watch anytime, anywhere • Conversions start at just $2; watch instantly • Access your movies on any Vudu compatible device Don’t have your UPC?

Available beginning today, March 23, at 12:00 a.m. EDT, Mobile Disc-to-Digital turns DVDs and Blu-rays into digital movies* with a simple scan through the Vudu app. These movies can then be viewed on hundreds of Vudu-enabled devices including televisions, Blu-ray disc players, gaming consoles, streaming players and through the Vudu app on phones and tablets. Over the past several years, Vudu has seen increased demand for its offerings that bridge physical and digital entertainment, including its in-home Disc-to-Digital service and InstaWatch, which automatically sends customers a digital copy of eligible DVDs or Blu-ray discs purchased at Walmart stores and on Walmart.com. “The average movie collector owns nearly 100 DVDs and Blu-rays.** We know these customers have invested a lot into building their physical movie collections,” said Jeremy Verba, general manager, Vudu. “As more and more customers create digital libraries, we are constantly looking for ways to help them unlock additional value from the movies they already own.” Mobile Disc-to-Digital works on iPhones and Android devices and is available for nearly 8,000 movies from Lionsgate, Paramount Home Media Distribution, Sony Pictures Home Entertainment, Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment, Universal Pictures Home Entertainment and Warner Bros. Home Entertainment. Additional titles will be added in the coming months. Movie fans can convert a DVD to SD or a Blu-ray disc to HDX for $2. To upgrade DVDs to HDX, it will cost $5 per title. All Vudu users will receive one complimentary first-time mobile conversion. Mobile Disc-to-Digital conversions must take place at a customer’s home / billing address. Mobile Disc-to-Digital works in three easy steps: 1. Scan – Navigate to Disc-to-Digital in the Vudu app and scan the barcode on the physical disc case. 2. Convert – Choose SD or HDX. Submit one title or scan all of your movies before submitting. 3. Watch – Watch your movies on any Vudu-enabled device. “Like Walmart, at Vudu we’re always striving to save our customers time and money,” added Verba. “Our Mobile Disc-to-Digital service is a key part of Vudu’s broader effort to make digital entertainment access simple and convenient.” For more information on Vudu, visit www.Vudu.com. *Customers need a free UltraViolet account in order to use Mobile Disc-to-Digital **Fox Media & Tech Tracker - 2016 About Vudu With more than 100,000 titles that can be watched on movie lovers’ favorite devices, Vudu gives users anytime, anywhere access to favorite movies and television shows.

Justin W Same thing that prevents you from walking into a store and scanning an on-the-shelf DVD you haven't purchased: nothing. F4LL0U7 The GPS feature prevents you from doing it at the store, but you could take a photo at the store and then do it at home. I don't really care enough to go through that hassle, but I'll definitely do the one complimentary conversion to try out the service. Impulse_Vigil I'm curious what does the location feature check for... Cause my billing address is a P.O. box a couple miles from my house. Zorn85 ...well presumably it will check to see if you are at the billing address, which you wouldn't be if it's a PO Box. They may not even accept PO Boxes as billing addresses for that very reason. Impulse_Vigil Vudu does, at least in general, it might error out for the purpose of this service tho. Hasn't gone live so can't very well try it and find out... Gregory What's a billing address? Brett What's a horse shoe? What does a horse shoe do? Are there any horse socks? Is anybody listening to me? Gregory You might be joking, but I genuinely have no idea what a billing address is. Internet search reveals that it's "an address to which you receive your credit card statement", but I've never seen a "credit card statement" in my life either... Matt Do you know what a shipping address is? Demitrius Harris Everybody knows that... clearly, a shipping address is a speech given to an audience of ships. Clearly. My1 well putting credit cards aside, you probably have to register with an address in case any bills or whatever may arrive, and the app will check whether you are at your registered address. F4LL0U7 Everybody my age pees their pants, it's the coolest disqus_Xz3y8OiO3O The address your credit card is registered on. tehboogieman UPCs for DVDs and Blurays are easily available online just like almost any movie that's on this list, Don't even need to go anywhere. I guess it's a way for pirates to launder their movies, but hardly seems worth it to pay for something a person is willing to "steal" Justin W Ah, missed that part of the article. Still, it's quite stupid to assume this would stop anyone from trying to get discount movies, as others have mentioned UPCs are available pretty much universally online. Impulse_Vigil You still need to pay per disc, so I imagine between the 100 movie cap and the cost they've crunched the numbers on possible losses... If you're going to all these trouble you'd probably just pirate it thru p2p anyway. Demitrius Harris Some people rather not steal, no matter the cost or savings. Impulse_Vigil You're misinterpreting my comment, I never justified stealing or pirating... Shoot I commented I'd be trying this out, I *still* buy BDs and even CDs. What I'm saying is that the companies behind this are aware there'll be a certain amount of people trying to game the system and they probably already crunched the numbers on potential losses... Plus they know that pirating a movie online is still much much easier, so they don't need to put so many safeguards on this system... Not that many people are gonna go around scanning barcodes with pretend addresses in order to steal online copies of a movie. Demitrius Harris Thank you for clarifying and yes, I misunderstood what you meant. HeyRadar Honestly, $2 (or $5.00) is a fair price for a media-less video anyway. Why digital and physical copies stayed the same price, was just price fixing. My1 I would agree if this is offline and without annoyances, but I have experienced too much of the bullshit happening there to believe that that would happen. Quint’s Sharking & Seashells Or you could just do it yourself at home using Handbrake. FernandoRocker But you could theoretically stream the Vudu movies from anywhere, not just locally. Impulse_Vigil Yeah that's one advantage... Uploading a bunch of rips to a cloud account or streaming them from home is certainly possible but more of a hassle. slayer91790 Then that's were Plex comes into play. mog386 But with handbrake you can't get hd versions of your DVDs. With Vudu you can get the HDX copy for a bit more. Which is perfect if you have a giant DVD collection that you never got rid of... Like me. Matt But you can't take a picture of a dvd in a store and put the picture into Handbrake. Shagnscooby Headline probably shouldn't imply you can do your whole collection for free when you only get one. A bit click-batey. DEKKER Read again: "for a fee". marcusmarcus2 I hate how articles headlines are click-batey when I don't read them. How dare they. Reading is hard. /s SHunter Couldn't you jus go to the store and start scanning barcodes? Just price checking! /wink cajunflavoredbob Settings > Developer Options > Enable Mock Locations Yes. Yes you could. You could also do a Google Search at home for the DVD box art, which would get you the barcode at home. If they block mock locations, root users can move the mock location app to /system. However, for all this hassle of trying to game Vudu as a service, you could also download the films illegally and not be restricted to Vudu's service. Point is that there are always ways around the artificial road blocks set up by media companies. Illegal is illegal. Choose your poison. Nathan J Well, you're still paying $5 for HD or $2 for SD. The fact that you supposedly bought it on DVD doesn't really matter. I mean, does it really? You could have bought the disc used for however low. You could have borrowed it from a friend. The idea that they made money on the first sale of the DVD is beside the point. They're selling you access to a DRM-locked digital file for $5. It's not an unfair price for the consumer, and it's straight profit to the rightsholder. I don't think you can really cheat them, since you're paying either way. Unless it's the free copy, which I'm guessing Vudu pays for. But they're paying regardless, and they don't see a single rusty red cent of the DVD's initial sale, so it doesn't matter (much) to them. Or at least it shouldn't. My1 you dont even need mock location, you also could just take a picture of the DVD with barcode and take a picture of that picture to scan the barcode, or you check google images. teh Jax Now I just need this to work on my HDDVD titles! jm9843 I did this in-store one time and they treated it like a DVD. So the 'conversion' to HD was a little more expensive ($5 instead of $2). teh Jax No shit?! That's pretty awesome! brararsh At first I read it as "Scan your DVD collection and convert it to digital for FREE". My Bad. :) Max Johnson Me too. Why the heck would I want to do it for a 'fee' when I can do it for free myself. enoch861 Well your first conversion is gratis. So there's that. Jeff Beck Keep in mind if you convert 10+ movies at a time you get a 50 percent discount, bringing the cost down to $1 a movie or 2.50 for an HD upgrade if you are using a DVD copy. I converted all the titles I could from my own library a couple years ago. I love not having to use discs anymore and my collection is available almost anywhere through VUDU. marcusmarcus2 Nice catch. Robert Preston It appears they sadly ended that promotion, finally. Josh The standard (long standing) 50% off for converting 10 titles at a time has now expired. Now, newcomers to D2D who use the mobile app to convert titles, get 50% off of 10 for their first conversion only. Previous users get 100% off their first mobile conversion, for a single title. Chris Griffin "Ok." - Plex users mjholtzem So it looks like this service is backed by UltraViolet, so that means discs that you convert with this service should be available on other UltraViolet clients such as Flixter right? enoch861 I believe so. But don't quote me on that. mjholtzem Any clue how that might work with "hdx" titles? enoch861 On other services it'll show up as HD since Vudu is the only one that has "HDX". As far as I can tell any Blu-Ray is redeemed as an HDX title. All my Blu-Rays I've redeemed (with the UV code) show up as HDX. mjholtzem If that's true this is actually pretty compelling Josh Yes, about UltraViolet and Flixster Video. Richard Branches Wish we could have this in other countries, I remember Vudu was planning to go internationally starting with Mexico but it didn't work out, which is sad 😞... Josh When I travelled, I was able to get it working with a VPN connection. Also Hola Unblocker worked in Chrome. Leonardo Baez Limitation of 100 titles per year.... But I have a 450 titles collection. (Dvds plus blurays) Jeff718 Pay again to have access anywhere without carrying around a DVD player. Nathan J Anywhere? So you can download the files for offline use and watch on an airplane? Or anywhere you have unmetered broadband access? Because there is a pretty big difference there. Not trying to be snarky here. I am unfamiliar with the Vudu service. I do have a couple movies up there. Since I started buying Blu-rays, a couple of them have had the digital HD option. (Pro tip, never do Google. They only offer SD copies. Found that out the hard way with Independence Day. Digital HD copy? Google is an option? Oh, Google only offers it in SD? And I can't change my mind and use Vudu instead? Well that sucks!) ProvoAggie They do allow offline playback. You can download them using the app on your tablet, phone or PC. br_hermon I doubt it but... does VUDU allow you to download the files locally so you can store them and play them via VLC, Kodi, etc? Is there DRM? or is it proprietary, and you can only view them on VUDU's servers (streaming)? Japzone It's just like all the other VOD services like iTunes, Google Play, etc. You stream from them, and they have a few apps that support offline playback. Plenty of DRM layered on as required by Hollywood. Jeff718 I toss my cases and put my discs in a binder. Am I screwed if I want to use this service? HeyRadar You may not be able to use the smartphone app, but you can still use the service using a PC, or taking your discs to Walmart. Course, you could probably find the UPC on the internet. Josh Note that the in-store Walmart conversion service ends on April 1. Mr. Robot Sounds like there's no conversion involved. This company just sells you those movies in digital form for a lower price because you already own the physical discs. But the article misses some important information, f.e. what format you get and if there's DRM or not. I bet there is. Japzone It doesn't miss anything. This is clearly about Vudu, a popular VOD Streaming service owned by Walmart. Everything is streamed and DRM protected, with some apps that support offline playback. Just like every other VOD Streaming service out there that deals with Hollywood content. Mr. Robot Sorry, not everybody who reads AP is from the US. I have never before heard of this service and as I said, the word "conversion" is a bit misleading IMO. And even after your answer I still don't know the format. Is it h264, hevc, VP9? Japzone There is no user accessible format. The content is accessed like Netflix. You stream using their website or apps, and the apps have a DRM protected offline function so you can store videos offline for a flight or trip. The user never gets direct access to the files. Sorian >400 dvds and blu-rays.... yeah... that's expensive for now. RyanT I'd say about half of my collection came with digital copies, would be nice to eventually have the other half digital as well, not to mention upgrading those awful old DVDs. Motoinsistor It's live now, just showed up for me in settings pfmiller Doesn't work for me. Tried my free conversion and it app just "captures" your UPC before you even have a chance to line up the barcode. Even if you manage to get the barcode lined up in time it always reports that it can't find the UPC. Michael Scapp I tried this today, and I got an error message every time. Still buggy, hoping it gets better with updates. My1 is this thing US only? would be great to convert my anime collection over. but probably the digital version is either online only and/or riddled with DRM Skeeter P I added some the first night. Now I tried to add more and it keeps saying location has to be same as billing address. It won't work. I didn't move from night before?? Powered phone off. restarted. checked location Button nothing helps. Any ideas?

Opdivo is already approved for the treatment of advanced melanoma, advanced non-small cell lung cancer, advanced renal cell carcinoma, classical Hodgkin lymphoma, advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, and urothelial carcinoma. Global sales of Opdivo in 2016 were $3.77 billion, up from $942 million in 2015. BMY closed Monday's trading at $54.21, down 0.31%. Dynavax Technologies Corp.'s (DVAX) resubmitted NDA for HEPLISAV-B, an experimental vaccine candidate for immunization against hepatitis B infection in adults 18 years of age and older, is scheduled to be reviewed by an FDA panel on July 28, 2017. The U.S. regulatory agency's decision on HEPLISAV-B is expected on August 10, 2017. This is HEPLISAV-B's third go-around with the FDA. Last November, the FDA refused to approve HEPLISAV-B, seeking information regarding several topics, including clarification regarding specific adverse events of special interest (AESIs), a numerical imbalance in a small number of cardiac events in a single study (HBV-23), new analyses of the integrated safety data base across different time periods, and post-marketing commitments. In February 2013 too, the FDA had rejected HEPLISAV-B, and requested additional data before it could be approved. DVAX closed Monday's trading at $5.85, down 1.68%. A heart disease trial using Mesoblast Ltd.'s (MESO) proprietary allogeneic mesenchymal precursor cells to grow heart muscle in children with hypoplastic left heart syndrome has been cleared by the FDA. The 24-patient trial is sponsored and funded by the Boston Children's Hospital with support from Bulens and Capozzi Foundation and the Ethan Lindberg Foundation. Mesoblast's product candidate MPC-150-IM is currently being evaluated in a phase III trial in up to 600 patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class II/III chronic heart failure (CHF) and in a United States National Institutes of Health (NIH)-funded phase IIb trial of 159 patients with NYHA Class IV CHF in conjunction with implantation of a left ventricular assist device (LVAD). MESO closed Monday's trading at $8.94, down 0.45%. Shares of Paratek Pharmaceuticals Inc. (PRTK) were up more than 32% in extended trading on Monday, following positive top-line results from its phase III study comparing once-daily oral and IV Omadacycline to Moxifloxacin in the treatment of patients with community-acquired bacterial pneumonia. In the study, dubbed OPTIC, Omadacycline met the FDA-specified primary endpoint of statistical non-inferiority compared to Moxifloxacin at the early clinical response 72-120 hours after initiation of therapy. The ECR rates for the Omadacycline and Moxifloxacin treatment arms were 81.1 % and 82.7%, respectively. The OPTIC study represents the second positive phase III registration study of Omadacycline, which will be used to support marketing applications to the FDA and the European Medicines Agency. The results of the first study, dubbed OASIS, were reported last June. In the OASIS study, the efficacy and safety of an IV to oral once-daily Omadacycline was compared against twice daily Linezolid over a 7 to 14-day course of therapy in 645 treated patients with acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections. The study too had met the primary efficacy endpoint of early clinical response. Another phase III study of oral-only Omadacycline in acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections is underway - with top-line data expected this quarter. PRTK closed Monday's trading at $18.60, down 3.38%. In after-hours, the stock was up 32.80% to $24.70. Sorrento Therapeutics Inc.'s (SRNE) phase Ib single arm trial testing its anti-CEA CAR-T therapy administered regionally by hepatic artery infusion, followed by selective internal radiation therapy in heavily pre-treated patients with CEA positive liver metastases has demonstrated promising clinical activity and safety. The primary objective of the study was to establish the safety of the CAR-T/selective internal radiation therapy combination. Secondary objectives included response assessed by modified RECIST (mRECIST), immune-related response criteria (irRC), and tumor marker kinetics. SRNE closed Monday's trading at $3.60, down 8.86%. In after-hours, the stock was up 8.33% to $3.90. Sucampo Pharmaceuticals Inc. (SCMP) has acquired privately-held rare disease company Vtesse, Inc. for an upfront consideration of $200 million. Sucampo funded the acquisition through the issuance of 2,782,678 shares of Sucampo Class A common stock and $170 million of cash on hand. Vtesse is focused on developing VTS-270 for the treatment of Niemann-Pick Disease Type C (NPC). VTS-270 is under a pivotal phase II/III trial. SCMP closed Monday's trading at $10.65, down 3.18%. Sanofi (SNY) has launched ACT Kids Toothpaste, a new anti-cavity fluoride toothpaste that is specially developed for kids two years of age and older. With its bubble gum and fruit punch flavors, 4 out of 5 parents say ACT Kids Toothpaste motivates their kids to brush their teeth, says the Company. The ACT Kids Toothpaste will be available in retail locations, including select Walmart, Walgreens, and Target locations. SNY closed Monday's trading at $45.14, down 0.24%. The FDA has approved Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.'s (TEVA) AUSTEDO tablets for the treatment of chorea associated with Huntington's disease. AUSTEDO, formerly known as SD-809, represents the first new treatment option for chorea associated with Huntington's disease in nearly a decade. The drug, which is tagged an Orphan Drug by the FDA, is expected to be available in the U.S. within the next 3 weeks. Chorea, which refers to involuntary, random and sudden, twisting and/or writhing movements, is a major symptom for many living with Huntington disease, a rare and fatal neurodegenerative disorder. Teva's first attempt to get AUSTEDO approved was turned down by the FDA last May. TEVA closed Monday's trading at $32.19, up 0.31%. Versartis Inc.'s (VSAR) three-year safety and efficacy data on Somavaratan is in line with historical U.S. daily recombinant human growth hormone data in pediatric growth hormone deficiency - on key parameters, including height velocity, bone maturation and other key measures of catch-up growth, as well as IGF-I response, metabolic parameters, and safety. Bradley S. Miller, Associate Professor in the Department of Pediatric Endocrinology at the University of Minnesota Masonic Children's Hospital said, "These results reinforce the 3.5 mg/kg twice-monthly dose selected for the ongoing Phase 3 VELOCITY trial, with mean peak IGF-I SDS at this dose in the upper half of the normal therapeutic range and no unexpected safety concerns. It is highly encouraging that the three-year results are in line with results from U.S. registries, and this represents an incremental advancement of our knowledge of long-term treatment with Somavaratan." VELOCITY is a phase III trial of Somavaratan in pediatric GHD, and top-line results from this trial are anticipated in Q3 2017. VSAR closed Monday's trading at $21.30, down 0.23%.

Miller, Associate Professor in the Department of Pediatric Endocrinology at the University of Minnesota Masonic Children's Hospital said, "These results reinforce the 3.5 mg/kg twice-monthly dose selected for the ongoing Phase 3 VELOCITY trial, with mean peak IGF-I SDS at this dose in the upper half of the normal therapeutic range and no unexpected safety concerns. It is highly encouraging that the three-year results are in line with results from U.S. registries, and this represents an incremental advancement of our knowledge of long-term treatment with Somavaratan." VELOCITY is a phase III trial of Somavaratan in pediatric GHD, and top-line results from this trial are anticipated in Q3 2017.

(Public Domain) The United States and China are the two largest economies in the world by far, and the upcoming trade war that is about to erupt will be cataclysmic for both sides. The Trump administration and the Chinese government are both gearing up for a prolonged trade war, and this will have very severe implications for the entire global economy. During the campaign, Donald Trump repeatedly stated that we "can't continue to allow China to [obscenity] our country", and he was quite correct about that. Over the past 10 years, the U.S. has run a trade deficit of over $2 trillion with China, and as a result of imbalanced trade, we have lost tens of thousands of manufacturing businesses, millions of good paying jobs and hundreds of billions of dollars of tax revenue. So clearly something needs to be done to balance our trade with China and other countries. But the situation must also be handled delicately, because trade disruptions could bring substantial short-term economic pain. Prior to winning the election, Trump threatened to unilaterally impose a 45 percent tariff on Chinese exports. Unfortunately, China is not just going to sit there and take whatever Trump throws at the country. Every single time the U.S. has imposed tariffs on Chinese goods in the past, China has responded by slapping tariffs on U.S. goods. And this time around, the Chinese are already preparing a very harsh response, even though Trump has not officially made his move yet: The policy advisers believe the Trump administration is most likely to impose higher tariffs on targeted sectors where China has a big surplus with the United States, such as steel and furniture, or on state-owned firms. China could respond with actions such as finding alternative suppliers of agriculture products or machinery and manufactured goods while cutting its exports of consumer staples such as mobile phones or laptops, they said. Other options include imposing tax or other restrictions on big U.S. firms operating in China, or limiting their access to China's fast-growing services sector, they added. When this coming trade war erupts, economic activity will be reduced significantly. And considering the fact that U.S. economic growth is projected to be about one percent in the first quarter of 2017, that could be more than enough to push us into a deep recession. Some of the biggest U.S. exports to China include airplanes, autos and agricultural products, and the Chinese are ready to attack on all of those fronts. The following comes from CNN: Here's what Global Times, a newspaper backed by the Communist Party, had to say about how Beijing would respond to tariffs of 45 percent: "A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus," the paper said Monday. "U.S. auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and U.S. soybean and maize imports will be halted." But once again, something must be done for the long-term good of our country. We have been allowing the Chinese to flood our shores with super-cheap goods, but meanwhile they have already been hitting our products with ridiculously high tariffs. Here is just one example: U.S.-made cars exported to China face tariffs of at least 25 percent, including American-made Cadillacs. The American-made Jeep Grand Cherokee costs $27,490 at U.S. dealerships and costs at least $85,000 in China. What we have with China today is very far from "free trade," and if they want to trade with us, they need to do so on a level playing field. But China will never allow that to happen. As Donald Trump has correctly stated, they have been "raping" us for years, and they are going to fight very hard to keep anything from upsetting the status quo. Trump has got to do something for the long-term good of the U.S. economy, but he has also got to try to find a way to avoid a major trade war, because a major trade war would be exceedingly painful for both countries. <a href="https://charisma-d.openx.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=6421ee36eb&cb=825935364" ><img src="https://charisma-d.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=536873539&cs=6421ee36eb&cb=825935364" border="0" alt=""></a> advertisement Most Americans don't realize this, but more iPhones are actually sold in China than in the United States. And it is being projected that Boeing will sell nearly 7,000 airplanes to China over the next decade: By the end of 2015, Chinese consumers bought 131 million iPhones. The total sales to U.S. customers during the same period stood at only 110 million. And iPhones are only a small part of U.S. exports. Boeing, which employs 150,000 workers in the U.S., estimates that China will buy some 6,810 airplanes over the next 20 years, and that market alone will be worth more than $1 trillion. So what happens if all or part of that economic activity goes away? According to one study, in the short-term millions of U.S. jobs could potentially be at risk if a major trade war happens: "Millions of American jobs that appear unconnected to international trade—disproportionately lower-skilled and lower-wage jobs—would be at risk," according to the PIIE study. And of course, a major trade war would hit American consumers very hard as well. Just think about it. When you go into a Wal-Mart or a dollar store, are more of the products made in the United States or in China? A trade war would hit all of us in the wallet as the cost of living goes up. And considering the fact that about two-thirds of the country is essentially living paycheck to paycheck, that would not be a good thing. So yes, our trading relationship with China definitely needs to be rebalanced, but Trump needs to find a way to make this transition as minimally disruptive as possible. A major trade war is just one of the "black swans" that could push us into the kind of economic nightmare scenario that I have been warning about for a very long time. And sometimes a trade war can serve as a prelude to a real war. The South China Sea has become a major sticking point between the U.S. and China, and the Chinese are getting ready to cross one of the "red lines" Barack Obama established while he was still in office: Beijing has plans to start construction on the disputed Scarborough Shoal this year. China has reclaimed land in both the Spratly and Paracel Islands and constructed military outposts, but it has been hesitant to start construction on the Scarborough Shoal. Xiao Jie, the mayor of Sansha—an administrative base for China's South China Sea activities masquerading as a city—said this week that China intends to construct environmental monitoring stations on a number of territories in the South China Sea, including the Scarborough Shoal. So how will Trump respond when construction on Scarborough Shoal actually begins? It will be very interesting to watch how that plays out. The relationship between the United States and China was starting to deteriorate badly even before Donald Trump was elected, and it is very easy to see how it could totally break down in the months ahead. And considering how interconnected the global economy is today, the United States and China could easily end up dragging down everyone else along with them.

It can be an irresistible offer to some whose is told it's "grant money." (WLS) An ABC7 I-Team Investigation WLS By Jason Knowles and Ann Pistone Monday, April 03, 2017 10:48PM How would you like $10,200 deposited into your checking account? It can be an irresistible offer to some whose is told it's "grant money" from the government. ABC7 consumer investigative reporter Jason Knowles received that offer on the phone and it was all caught on video. The scammer told Knowles that he would get the government grant money because he was a good citizen who paid his bills. And getting that money would be easy, said the caller, who identified himself as being from the U.S. government and agreed to be recorded. "It's your money. It's your choice. You can use this money, whatever you want," the caller said. "It unfortunately comes once in your lifetime." Knowles just had to turn over his checking account information, they said. CALLER: Your name and telephone number has randomly selected by the United States government to receive free grant money, $10,200 which you don't need to pay back again to the government. Or you don't need to pay tax on this grant money, OK? JASON KNOWLES: OK, how do I get the grant money? CALLER: Yes, first of all, do you know why you are receiving this free grant money? JK: No. Why? CALLER: OK, so let me explain it to you. Government selects around 1,700 citizens, including you, because, according to your files, you don't have a criminal record, you pay the bill in advance of a lifetime and you don't file any bankruptcy for the last six months, right?" However, the Federal Trade Commission said the government will never call to offer you a grant, unless you've applied with a legitimate agency for educational, community or medical research money. This caller, who may be using spoofing technology to appear as though he's calling from New York City, told Knowles that there are several ways for to get my money. The first involves sending a smaller amount. JK: So I am going to send them money and they are going to send me $10,000? CALLER: Yes. You can receive your grant money from the Western Union, Money Gram, Walmart store or in form of cash or you can receive the money on any plastic card. The caller wanted Knowles to give him his check card number or checking account number so he could supposedly deposit that cash directly onto my card or in my checking account. The FTC said it's a ruse to steal my account information CALLER: If you want to receive your money on your bank account, we are going to transfer your money on your bank account, ok? JK: OK, thanks. CALLER: You're welcome. So you want to receive your money on your bank account? JK: Yeah. CALLER: Ok, saving account or checking account. JK: Checking account CALLER: Checking. OK, and can you give me your checking account number? JASON: Oh, OK, you want my checking account number? CALLER: Yes for your money transaction, ok? " Knowles did not give out his account number. If he had, experts said the scammer would have drained his account. Anyone who receives a similar call should just hang up, experts said. To file a scam report go to www.ftc.gov/complaint or call 1-877-FTC HELP.

Alts Equities Smart-Beta New ETFs ETF Ecosystem Webcasts ETF Newsletter Video Podcasts ETF Strategist Channel Search You Are Here: Home → 2017 → March → An ETF to Access the ‘Greatest Growth Story of Our Lifetime’ An ETF to Access the ‘Greatest Growth Story of Our Lifetime’ March 31, 2017 at 3:22 pm by Max Chen Many investors have looked into the developing economies as the next growth story, and within the emerging markets, the internet and online retailer space may be the greatest growth story of our lifetime. ETF Trends publisher Tom Lydon spoke with Kevin Carter, Founder of EMQQ, at the Inside ETFs conference that ran Jan. 22-25, 2017 to talk about the growing internet business in the emerging economies. “It’s growing at a huge rate, you’re absolutely right, and that’s really the story,” Carter said. “This is, I believe, the greatest growth story of our lifetime.” Here in the states and across other developed economies, many have taken internet usage for granted as it has become an integral part of our daily lives. However, the internet is only just beginning to seep into the developing economies. “You have 85% of the world’s population just now getting the internet and they’re getting it on a smartphone. You take this massive wave of emerging market consumers; you give them a cheap smartphone, broadband internet access; and you have basically 40% revenue growth for a sector, which I believe is the greatest growth for a sector that’s existed in our lifetime,” Carter said. Moreover, as smartphone usage becomes more widespread in the emerging markets, consumers are increasingly turning to the internet and online retailers to easily buy whatever they want. “They’re basically leapfrogging our initial computer and internet adoption cycle of the desktop with cable, and they’re also leapfrogging traditional retail,” Carter added. “Traditional retail is being replaced by Amazon, and in the emerging markets, they don’t have a Target store, hey don’t have a Walmart store, so you give them a smartphone and access to Alibaba, to Mercadolibre.” Investors interested in this potential growth story can tap into this emerging market sector through a targeted Emerging Markets Internet & Ecommerce ETF (NYSEArca: EMQQ), which tracks both internet and online retail or e-commerce companies. The ETF target technology and internet names, like Tencent Holdings 8.1%, Alibaba 7.6%, Naspers 7.5%, Netease Inc 6.1%, Baidu 5.9% and CTrip.com 5.9%, among others.

Published on April 03, 2017. The 'Truth About America' report from McCann found consumer distrust for brands -- and demands. from them.  Credit: McCann Most Popular In case there was ever any doubt, the country's political divide is making life difficult for marketers. Some 42% of Americans find brands and companies less truthful today than 20 years ago, according to a survey presented by McCann at the 4A's Transformation conference on Monday. At the same time, 84% of respondents to the survey, conducted by McCann's Truth Central unit, said they believe brands have the power to make the world better place. Some 48% said brands need a strong identity and clear role. So what are marketers supposed to do? Panelists discussing the study advised steering clear of politics unless they relate to a social cause that's integral to your brand identity. Marketers' compass should be purpose, not politics, they said. And they should speak to similarities among consumers, which McCann called "glue." The survey asked 1,000 participants which institutions made them most proud to be from the United States. Conservatives cited the Department of Defense and liberals chose the Internal Revenue Service and the Environmental Protection Agency. But there was an institution on which they both agreed: NASA. Both also said inventors and scientists best exemplify American values. Which brand would they vote for? Conservatives chose Walmart and liberals Google and Microsoft, but both liberals and conservatives would elect Apple and Amazon. Steve Zaroff, chief strategy officer of McCann North America, said the original intent of the study was not to focus on politics but "the people in America would not let us" ignore it. Politics has "risen to the level of popular culture," he said. Kathleen Hall, corporate VP-brand advertising and research at Microsoft, said during the panel that advertisers totally misread the election, taking its result as a foregone conclusion and forgetting that New York City is "not the USA." But it wasn't just the Rust Belt supporting Donald Trump, she added. "I know a ton of people who voted for Turmp and that is not who they are," Ms. Hall said. She urged unity going forward. "Let's stop indicating it was some kind of idiiot mistake" that he was elected, she said. The last word of advice for brands to win back consumer trust? Mr. Zaroff offered a three-point formula: Choose culture, not politics; positivity still wins; and be prepared for unexpected feedback in a world where marketing can often take on unintended political overtones.

(Dana Melius/St. Peter Herald) By DANA MELIUS dmelius@lesueurnews-herald.com St. Peter Area Food Shelf volunteer Karen Smithers receives a $500 donation from the Nicollet County Corn and Soybean Growers association representative Jerry Payne. (Submitted photo) The number of donations during March's food drive aren't yet finalized, but organizers sense record contributions came the St. Peter Area Food Shelf's way. Volunteers were busy stocking shelves Friday, the final day of the 2017 March FoodShare campaign. The traditional drive is a partnership between 300 Minnesota food shelves and the Greater Minneapolis Council of Churches, which started the annual program in 1982 and expanded it statewide a year later. Nancy Helgeson, St. Peter Area Food Shelf coordinator, said it was a banner month of collecting food items and dollars from a variety of sources.  "Today (Friday) is the last day and we've been at it since 10 a.m.," said Helgeson, who has served as Food Shelf coordinator for 12 years. "I have wonderful volunteers. So it looks like we're going to get it done." Volunteer Karen Smithers said some donation totals topped the local charts, with a challenge within the Nicollet County departments contributing 1,651 pounds of food items to the local food shelf. The Nicollet County commissioners were tops among departments, it was announced last week. But the St. Peter Boy Scouts Troop 58 weren't far behind, totaling 1,619 pounds during their March "Scouting for Food" drive. Throughout the regional Twin Valley Council, area Cub Scouts and Boys Scouts raised a total of almost 36,000 pounds during which 956 Scouts and volunteers contributed. Helgeson and Smithers also praised the annual local partnership with the St. Peter Food Coop, which asks customers to round up on their purchases throughout March. This year's Food Coop donation totaled $6,025.34. That's an increase from a 2016 total of $5,665.25. "The St. Peter Food Coop helped out with many of the businesses," added Smithers. "They're a blessing." One of those other St. Peter area businesses, Alumacraft, donated 983 pounds of food. The Nicollet and Sibley County Corn and Soybean Growers also donated $500 each to Sibley County FoodShare and the St. Peter Area Food Shelf.  The two organizations also conduct a food shelf drive in December, donating $1,000 worth of soy products. Local students also got into the act, with South Elementary contributing 880 pounds of food during the March drive. Helgeson noted a new idea this year, with children from First Lutheran Church putting together 80 paper grocery bags with ingredients for making chili. The organized concept works well for food shelf customers and has been well-received, she said. Other highlights from the 2017 drive included substantial bread donations from the Wal-Mart Distribution Center in Mankato, as well as the ongoing availability of fresh fruit and vegetables, such as strawberries, asparagus and Brussels spouts. The local food shelf also has an ongoing arrangement with the Echo Food Shelf in Mankato, which sends excess products to St. Peter. Helgeson noted the annual March drive is a good way to stock the food shelves in anticipation for the higher customer traffic and needs throughout the summer months. So despite the fully-stocked shelves, Helgeson said, "We still keep allotments the same." Demand remains high for food shelf services, according to Helgeson. "During the recession, demand went up and never went down," she said. Food shelves throughout the state track dollars and pounds of food donated during March. After final totals are tabulated, Minnesota FoodShare then donates additional funds based on those figures. The March FoodShare campaign raised $7.9 million dollars and brought in 5.2 million pounds of food in 2016, the most successful in drive history. Reach Dana Melius at 507-931-8568. DID YOU KNOW?

Amazon Business will aim to cater to the procurement needs of businesses of all sizes, as well as institutional buyers including universities, hospitals and non-profits. “Whether you are a sole trader, a buyer in a mid-size company or a chief procurement officer in a large multi-national organisation, Amazon Business has the products and capabilities to serve your needs,” Bill Burkland, who heads up Amazon Business in the UK, said in a statement. Read more Amazon’s Bezos leapfrogs Buffett to become second richest person More than a hundred million products will be available to companies that sign up to the service, including laptops, office supplies, furniture and commercial-grade printers. Businesses will also be able to buy highly specialised equipment— like power tools and thermal imaging cameras— and lab supplies like microscopes, test tubes and high-speed centrifuges. Amazon Business already launched in the US in April 2015 and now serves more than 400,000 businesses there. It generated more than $1bn (£800m) in sales in its first year, according to the company. Last December it rolled out in Germany, where it is now used by more than 50,000 business customers. The latest launch in the UK could help bolster Amazon’s already meteoric stock price rise and it also underscores the company’s commitment to diversifying both its customer base and the services it provides. Read more Amazon opens supermarket with no checkouts, no aisles and no cash Amazon sees off rival bid to pick up Souq.com Amazon avoids $1.5bn US tax bill in court ruling Amazon axes employment agency at heart of Sports Direct scandal Last year, Amazon started a food delivery service across London–directly rivalling players like Deliveroo and UberEats—and more recently the company has launched a drive-through style of bricks-and-mortar supermarket in the US. Customers order their food online then collect from a warehouse, with bags pre-packed and loaded into the boot by Amazon employees. And the company’s proven ability to shake up the markets in which it operates seems to be paying off. Amazon’s share price has surged by close to 50 per cent over the last year to a record high, valuing the company at well over $400bn. Profits last year increased nearly three-fold to $2.4bn on sales of about $136bn, partly thanks to the launch of its Amazon Echo home assistant and the popularity of its media streaming services for Amazon Prime members. Founder Jeff Bezos recently overtook Warren Buffett in a Bloomberg ranking of the world’s richest people, to nab second spot after Microsoft founder Bill Gates. Mr Bezos, who is also Amazon's chairman and chief executive, is now worth $75.6bn – which marks a massive $10.2bn increase so far in 2017.

Those currently in seasonal roles would be encouraged to take permanent ones, the company said, taking its total UK workforce to more than 24,000.

"It's been great for us. We've been able to sell through all of the allocation that we've gotten from Nintendo in very short order. We can't keep it on the shelves," said Lloyd, who is also a CNBC CFO Council contributor. The new Nintendo Switch console went on sale on March 3 and is part of an effort to adapt to the changing preferences of gamers. Nintendo is reportedly doubling its production of the Switch console by March 2018. Lloyd noted that while GameStop heard this rumor as well, Nintendo has not confirmed it and thus it is not reflected in their forward look. Shares of GameStop fell about 12 percent year to date, closing down 2 percent on Monday. The broader SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT) is down over 5 percent year to date despite consumer confidence hitting its highest level last month since December 2000. Lloyd pointed to the IRS delaying tax returns as a contributing factor to the slump in the retail sector and in GameStop's shares. "I think in February, we saw a little bit of an impact of the IRS delaying the start of the tax refunds. I think that carried over into the consumer," Lloyd said in an interview with "Closing Bell." However, according to Lloyd, the IRS has almost reached the same level of refunds that it issued this time last year, a boon to the video gaming industry because "Americans as a public like to spend some of their refunds on console video gaming." The Texas-based company saw a decline in sales across almost all of its categories in the fourth quarter, posting revenue of $3.05 billion versus analyst expectations of $3.10 billion. The company did beat earnings estimates of $2.29 per share, reporting earnings of $2.38 per share for the quarter. GameStop has also announced that it will be closing hundreds of stores by the end of the year as the retailer faces increased competition from Amazon and Wal-Mart. Lloyd sees GameStop continuing to pursue its diversification strategy over the next few years to become less dependent on console game cycles. The company will continue to expand other business divisions such as its collectibles and technology brands divisions. "We have a technology brands division that now has over 1,500 stores, including more than 1,400 branded AT&T as AT&T's largest retail partner. We'll continue to grow that business. We got 90 million in operating earnings from that business in 2016 and would expect to grow that by 30 percent or more in 2017," the CFO said. "More than half of AT&T's retail locations are actually operated by resellers like GameStop. They're branded AT&T, so you would really need to look for the signage to know the difference," Lloyd added. — CNBC's Melody Myers contributed to this report.

Tesla Is Worth More Than Ford How To Make Your Social Media Accounts As Private As Possible Google: Please Don't Look At Our Very Tiny Ad Problem Libby Watson Apr 4, 2017, 7:00am ⋅ Filed to:  advertising google youtube Share It's been a tough few weeks for Google. Several companies have pulled their ads from its network after various news outlets revealed that those ads have appeared on extremist, racist or otherwise offensive videos. But never fear. A Google executive says the problem is, actually, small. And not just very small, in fact. Not even very, very small. But very, very, very small. Philipp Schindler, left, in 2010 (Image: Getty) In a new interview with Recode, Google's chief business officer, Philip Schindler, downplayed the seriousness of the problem: "It has always been a small problem," with "very very very small numbers" of ads running against videos that aren't "brand- safe," says Google's chief business officer, Philipp Schindler. "And over the last few weeks, someone has decided to put a bit more of a spotlight on the problem." Schindler specifically claimed the "error rates" — as in the number of ads appearing on offensive videos — "are tiny, tiny". A Google spokesperson later told Recode: "When we spoke with many of our top brand advertisers, it was clear that the videos they had flagged received less than 1/1000th of a per cent of the advertisers' total impressions." But those videos, even if they were 0.001 per cent of advertisers' impressions, caused huge problems for Google — and threatened its massive revenue stream. Several outlets, including the UK Times and the Wall Street Journal, published evidence of ads appearing on racist, anti-Semitic and extremist videos over the past few weeks, which led to several huge companies pulling their ads, including AT&T and Walmart. This doesn't exactly seem like a "small problem", and that much is clear from Google's response — it announced changes to its policies to allow advertisers more control over where its ads appear, and recently promised to train its AI to better detect content that a brand wouldn't want its ads anywhere near. But judging by Schindler's comments, it seems like Google is primarily concerned not with the problem itself, but rather that people are paying attention. Saying that "someone", that is, several news outlets, has "decided to put a bit more of a spotlight on the problem" really makes it sound like Google is a lot more troubled by the criticism than the problem itself. Schindler even went on to say that the "problem comes from the fact that somebody is aggressively putting it onto the front page". Ah, yes. The "problem" for Google is less the overlap of Good brands and Bad videos, and more the annoying fact that people keep talking about it. How pesky. [The Guardian] WATCH MORE: Tech News Comments Zombie Jesus @zombiejesus Apr 4, 2017, 7:42am Ultimately the magnitude of this problem came down to perception, and that perception was driven by news reports. It's not the first time the media or small vocal sections of public response have driven companies to disproportionately large responses, they're very concerned with public image. Companies pulling all advertising was never a reasonable response but it was one that telegraphed to the rolling internet boycott machine not to target them for something no reasonable person would blame them for in the first place. Google's adjusting the algorithm and as soon as the media coverage dies down and the threat to companies' public images subsides it'll be back to business as usual. Don't get me wrong, I loathe all the drama and hate speech that's all over Youtube. But I'm not silly enough to think Holden supports someone calling Ita Buttrose an old hag just because their ad appeared before the video. Reply 4 vangrat @vangrat Apr 4, 2017, 7:52am https://media.giphy.com/media/5xtDarmwsuR9sDRObyU/giphy.gif Reply 2 Cameron @moonhead Apr 4, 2017, 8:36am Everyone seems to be ignoring the fact Google allows these types of videos, provides support for them, and profits off them. The question should be, not what Google is doing to fix their ad serving algorithm, but instead, why they're not pulling these videos before they even get to having ads on them? Reply 0 Roland @roland Apr 4, 2017, 8:42am ahh you know how many hours of video are loaded onto YouTube every minute? Reply 1 zeitxgeist @zeitxgeist Apr 4, 2017, 8:49am Do you have a spare few billion to bankroll the systems and staff necessary to police it? The staff alone required to sift through hundreds of thousands of hours of content to pull out the overtly awful stuff would be unfathomable. 300 hours of footage is uploaded every minute. Insane. Reply 1 anteaters @anteaters Apr 4, 2017, 9:10am Remember reading somewhere it would take 60,000 years of non-stop watching to watch each and every video on YouTube as there are approximately 81,941,760 videos on youtube which by the time you have read this sentence would have increased. Reply 1 Cameron @moonhead Apr 4, 2017, 11:14am Not my money, Google is the one making the money here. You also don't need to watch every video, just the ones that want to monitise with ads. Also, reporting systems can, and should, be used to flag inappropriate content, which Google should be removing. Reply 0 Archfiend @travisnew87 Apr 4, 2017, 9:55am Not all videos being vilified are bad but are only bad to a particular demographic. A recent one was a YouTuber showing how the UK government was potentially supplying their officers with "stab proof" safety vest which wasn't stab proof and he was doing a video to expose them. Some outlets said he was glorifying and showing people how to kill officers when in fact he was shaming the government into providing proper support and equipment for their public servants. Take a step back realise that each person only has their own slice of truth and you need to know the whole story before condemning any individuals actions. Reply 1 Cameron @moonhead Apr 4, 2017, 11:16am There are very clear cut cases that could be excluded if proper rules were in place. They already do this for Muslim extremists, but seem to ignore the white nationalists. Reply 0 mark_d @mark_d Apr 4, 2017, 10:15am Oh shit, thought police have an avid supporter. Frankly I don't agree with hate speech but I'm not going to pretend that removing anyones freedom of speech is anything but draconian. It is this exact attitude that is corroding social equality and enabling hate speech. You should be engaging in discussion and learning how to hold conversations. It's obvious they're upset about something regardless of your opinion. So help them to see why it's wrong and if you cant do that, don't say anything at all because you're making the situation worse. I am of course talking about people in our own communities. Other societies may simply just have different values which you cant change. eg clash of religions. Reply 0 Cameron @moonhead Apr 4, 2017, 11:12am It's not freedom of speech. People can say whatever they want. There's no inherent right to have a platform to spew hate speech from, however. The difference is a right to response. When a single person says something, other people are on equal footing to reply. When someone has a platform to spread their message, people who disagree with that message can't respond in an equal way. Reply 0 blueyy @blueyy Apr 4, 2017, 12:08pm So now you want to regulate how many people listen to someone? No one has a right to have a platform, they build the platform themselves. None of the channels with "hate speech" on YouTube started with thousands of subs or viewers, they built that up by providing content that those viewers wanted. You have the exact same opportunity on YouTube as everyone else. Reply 0 Join the discussion! Log In Sign Up Guest Access Join the discussion!

Streaming music came not long after -- Spotify was founded in 2008, and competitors were close on its heels. In 2017, the answer you'd get could not be more different. Vinyl is cool again, as much as it ever has been if not moreso. The power of the internet, too, is changing the way that vinyl records are thought up and sold.

A report by the ABC's Emily Laurence has revealed that if a property is "categorised as Service Class 0", NBN Co will almost certainly give it a miss, even if you're in a rollout area.

Print Email Charles Thompson | cthompson@pennlive.com By Charles Thompson | cthompson@pennlive.com The Patriot-News Email the author | Follow on Twitter on April 03, 2017 at 4:15 PM, updated April 03, 2017 at 5:39 PM comments This post was updated at 5:40 p.m. with comments from the Wolf Administration. Is Pennsylvania ready now for a "Wait. There's more!" moment when it comes to liquor sales liberalization? We're about to find out. Less than a year into the wine and beer privatization model that has seen limited sales of those products from restaurants, groceries and convenience stores around the state, the state House Liquor Control Committee took action on two additional sales reforms. One bill, House Bill 438, would permit the businesses with "restaurant" or "hotel" licenses that are now selling up to four bottles of wine to go be permitted to do the same, if they wish, with hard liquor. The second, House Bill 991, would let other retailers sell wine and liquor through a new class of state-awarded retail licenses designed to boost the number of alcohol selling points across the state. Both bills squeaked through with 14-12 committee votes Monday, with free market Republicans carrying them to passage. All Democrats voted "no," along with Rep. Scott Petri, a Republican from Bucks County, who argued that license fees as set in both bills are too low, and represents a "giveaway" of a now-valuable state asset to the private sector. Both bills' fate is uncertain at this early stage, and one major stumbling block would be Gov. Tom Wolf. Wolf's press secretary J.J. Abbott said Monday that Wolf "does not support these bills. He is currently focused on allowing the consumer-centric reforms enacted last year to be fully implemented and ensuring the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board is working to maximize returns and consumer convenience." Still, the new reforms are getting kick-started in the budget season, when any legislation that carries the promise of new revenue cannot be dismissed out-of-hand. Here's a closer look at what the proposed bills do. Booze equity. Westmoreland County Republican Mike Reese's bill attempts to "do for spirits what we've done for wine." Meaning, that for a fee of $2,000, all qualifying bars, restaurants and even grocery stores could sell up to four bottles of scotch, gin, vodka or other booze for off-premise consumption. That kind of liquor is, at the moment, still exclusively the province of the state-owned liquor stores in Pennsylvania. Distilleries have been aggressively pushing for this measure since the approval of the "wine privatization" bill last year, arguing that alcohol is alcohol is alcohol and it should all have equal treatment in the retail space. Opponents, including Democrats who are allies of the public sector union that staffs the state stores, argued, in the words of Rep. Kevin Boyle, D-Philadelphia, that the bill will continue "the unraveling of a hugely profitable liquor system for the state of Pennsylvania." Others said they are simply concerned about moving too fast with liquor liberalization, and argued more time is needed to gauge the impacts of the 2016 reforms before another set of changes is passed. "We're not having that conversation as we're going down this line of expansion, and that concerns me," said Rep. Morgan Cephas, D-Philadelphia.  Petri, meanwhile, said by his calculations the cost of such a license, in order to give taxpayers a fair return on the value of the state's current monopoly on retail liquor sales, should be about $80,000. Pennsylvania could finally see its first privately owned liquor store: Here's how Increasing the number of outlets. Introduced by Liquor Control Chair Adam Harris, R-Juniata County, HB 991 would create new retail licenses letting private retailers ranging from Wal-Mart to a country store to a beer distributor sell a limited number of wine and spirits. Harris says one major aim of his bill is to create new customer convenience in rural counties where, at present, there may be just one state store now serving the entire county. But the bill, by granting one such license for every 6,000 residents, could actually provide about 90 new retail liquor outlets in a highly-populated county like Lancaster. Harris believes his model can work because existing businesses -- including beer distributors -- can incorporate the new product into their existing product lines, and in many cases may not even need to hire new personnel. "The feedback I've gotten (from last year's changes) is positive, but it always follows up with: 'But why can't I get X at Y?,' Harris said. "We're trying to fill in those gaps that you hear from consumers." Committee staffers noted that the bill could authorize up to 2,400 new alcohol retailers statewide -- or roughly four times the current number of state stores. Supporters have argued that the number of liquor sales outlets in Pennsylvania is far lower than the norm across America, but opponents said this level of proliferation for higher-proof alcohol troubled them. "That's a lot of booze, folks, out in the area," said Rep. William Kortz, D-Allegheny County, "and I don't know that a lot of the groups would be in favor of that." The early read. Neither bill is seen as a slam dunk, primarily because of the push-and-pull between the various interests at play in the alcohol industry. To wit, a trade group representing beer distributors almost immediately panned the bill in a letter, arguing that non-compete zones set up around existing state stores and high licensing fees would bar many distributors from taking advantage of the new licenses. But privatization fever may be running higher than ever in a General Assembly with historically large Republican majorities in both the state House and Senate. Wendell Young, president of the union representing more than 3,000 state liquor store clerks, said Monday he is putting his faith in Wolf to stop what Young sees as a back-door route to getting the state out of the liquor business, a longtime goal of House Speaker Mike Turzai, R-Allegheny County. At present, just 389 "wine-expanded permits' have been issued statewide. That number could grow into the thousands, but is slowing a little bit now due to the fixed number of existing licenses available.  'Zombies,' lobbyists and vodka at grocery stores: What's next for Pa. liquor reform?

By Jefferson Morley / AlterNet April 3, 2017 Print Comments Photo Credit: Gage Skidmore / Flickr President Trump's plan for protecting and creating American jobs has taken three forms while he's been in office. First, he talks up American jobs and browbeats companies relocating to Mexico or overseas. While Trump exaggerates and takes credit when he doesn’t deserve it, he regularly ties his image and his presidency to the story of jobs in America, a politically astute move. But Trump needs more than rhetoric on jobs if he wants to protect Republican congressional majority in 2018 and have any chance of reelection in 2020. He needs to take measures that actually create jobs. The second plank of Trump’s job program is the much touted and much delayed “trillion-dollar infrastructure jobs plan,” favored by White House adviser Steve Bannon. However, the plan has yet to be drawn up and is not scheduled for presentation until next year. It remains to be seen if Trump and Bannon can harmonize their infrastructure jobs program with that of Senate Democrats or the American Society of Civil Engineers. So far, Trump has made health care and tax reform a higher priority and shown little ability to work with anybody on passing legislation. The third and most substantive part of Trump’s job plan is buried in current tax reform legislation: a tax on imported goods that (Trump says) will favor U.S.-based manufacturers and exporters and thus create jobs in the United States. You wouldn't know it from the headlines, but with "tax reform" now trumpeted as the administration's top legislative priority, Trump's jobs agenda is up for approval on Capitol Hill for the first time. Conservatives Split Trump is already faltering, even in his messaging. To describe the administration's top priority as "tax reform," and not "job creation" reflects Paul Ryan's priorities more than Trump's. The label weakens the president's ability to sell a radical change in corporate tax policy that is already proving as divisive as Trump's failed health care bill. Trump's salesmanship is not particularly aggressive or compelling. In an interview with Reuters in February, Trump embraced the notion of an import tax, also known as a "border adjustment tax." “I certainly support a form of tax on the border,” Trump said. He argued the measure would encourage companies to bring manufacturing jobs back to the United States, a critical component of his platform. Even when announcing his adminstration's pivot to tax reform after the health care debacle, Trump didn't talk much about the import tax or jobs. As with Obamacare repeal, the most right-wing factions on Capitol Hill are not buying into Trump’s vision. "Conservative Split Over Import Tax Imperils Trump’s Overhaul," the New York Times reported Sunday. A month ago I asked, "Who Wins? Trump v. the Koch Brothers on Jobs." So far the answer, according to the Times, is the Koch brothers. Supported by Walmart and other giants of the retail industry, Koch family political front groups are moving to stifle Trump’s tax plan before it ever gets out of the House Ways and Means committee. What Trump touts as a jobs plan, one Koch-funded group defines as a tax increase on millennials. Another Koch-funded organization, Americans for Prosperity, is running TV ads denouncing the border adjustment tax (or BAT) as a $1.2 trillion tax increase on seniors and the working poor. The split over Trump’s tax and jobs plans, says the Times,“is exposing the broader ideological divide between nationalist policies embraced by Mr. Trump and the traditional small-government movement that his election ejected from the driver’s seat of Republican policy-making.” Trump does have leverage in this negotiation. To enact a tax bill that does not increase the federal deficit but does deliver what Republicans want most—rate cuts for wealthy taxpayers and corporations—Congress needs to find some source of new revenue. Hence the import tax.  Trump's Challenge To prevail, Trump will have to convince a majority of the House Ways and Means committee that BAT is worth adopting because it will create American jobs and will not raise prices on imported goods, despite what the local retail business community is saying. And if the House approves the BAT, Trump will have to protect those provisions in the Senate, where opposition is likely to be even stiffer. That would be a heavy lift for any White House. For a president as disengaged and disorganized as Trump, it seems highly unlikely, if not impossible. Trump doesn’t have a strong relationship with Ryan, who cares more about tax cuts than job creation. Trump doesn’t have a White House staff capable of coaxing and threatening wavering congress members to come around to his point of view. And he doesn’t have the discipline or the intellect to explain and sell a radical policy change to Congress, much less to the country. It's not something you can do in 140-character bursts. So the only substantive measure in Trump’s much-touted jobs agenda is at risk of dying a slow and invisible death. What Happens Next Writing tax legislation is one of the slowest and most complex of the lawmaking arts. Congressional leaders have talked about having a tax bill ready to send to the president by August. Whether it will contain any of Trump’s job stimulation measures is already very much in doubt. One of Trump’s most effective lines on the campaign trail was that the Washington establishment was “all talk and no action.” If Trump can’t defeat the Koch brothers, pass the border adjustment tax and claim a job creation victory this year, he is going to be vulnerable to the same charge on jobs.

(Credit: News 12 Long Island) advertisement | advertise on newsday Nassau County Executive Edward Mangano said Monday the $165 million face-lift to the Nassau Coliseum has given the New York Islanders a “path” for the team to return to their old home in Uniondale. Mangano, a Republican who delivered his eighth State of the County address from the renovated arena, said the Coliseum has “modern amenities” for fans and athletes and the opportunity to increase its 13,900-seat capacity.

The Islanders moved to the Barclays Center in Brooklyn in 2015. But the team’s new ownership is reportedly unhappy with attendance in their second year in Brooklyn, along with obstructed sight lines and poor ice quality at Barclays.

The team’s ownership has looked at building a new arena next to Citi Field in Queens or at state-run Belmont Park, sources said. advertisement | advertise on newsday Mangano met with Islanders’ co-owner Jonathan Ledecky in November to discuss the team’s return to the Coliseum, which reopens Wednesday with a Billy Joel concert. Earlier in the speech Mangano unveiled a new policy program — a Civil Defense Initiative that would allow residents to receive two hours of training in active shooter situations, heroin awareness and homeland security. Graduates of the program, Mangano said, will receive access to a “virtual neighborhood watch,” which includes live crime data and the ability to direct tips and concerns to Nassau police analysts. The program, officials said, will be funded from the Nassau Police Department’s budget. In his 76-minute speech to the GOP-controlled county legislature, Mangano touted Nassau’s low crime rate and his administration’s efforts to combat heroin addiction, reduce borrowing and balance the county’s finances. Nassau ColiseumSecrets and fun facts of the new Coliseum Mangano also defended his reforms to the county’s property tax assessment system, which has come under criticism as unfairly benefiting residents who grieve their property taxes. A Newsday report found that residents who don’t grieve assessments have seen their taxes rise by an average of 35.7 percent over the last seven years. @Newsday Tweets from @Newsday/newsday-staff “Our reforms help reduce these inequities,” Mangano said. Mangano’s speech made no mention of his October indictment on federal corruption charges of receiving bribes and kickbacks from Bethpage restaurateur and longtime friend Harendra Singh. Mangano, who has yet to say if he will run for a third term, has pleaded not guilty. In his rebuttal to the State of the County, Minority Leader Kevan Abrahams (D-Freeport) called Mangano’s leadership “a nightmare” and said “Nassau taxpayers deserve better.” Get the Newsday Now newsletter!

Business Jobs departing U.S. for Mexico again as Trump’s threats ignored Mexico Kevin Geil / San Antonio Express-News Despite threats from President Donald Trump to keep jobs in the U.S., companies continue to shift work to Mexico. Despite threats from President Donald Trump to keep jobs in the U.S., companies continue to shift work to Mexico. (Kevin Geil / San Antonio Express-News) Thomas BlackBloomberg After Donald Trump’s election, the flow of manufacturers setting up shop south of the border dwindled to a trickle. Ford Motor Co. and Carrier Corp., caught in Trump’s Twitter crosshairs, scrapped plans to move jobs to Mexico in two very public examples of the slowdown. But now the pace is picking back up. Illinois Tool Works Inc. will close an auto-parts plant in Mazon, Ill., and head to Ciudad Juarez. Triumph Group Inc. is reducing the Spokane, Wash., workforce that makes fiber-composite parts for Boeing Co. aircraft and moving production to Zacatecas and Baja California. TE Connectivity Ltd. is shuttering a pressure-sensor plant in Pennsauken, N.J., in favor of a facility in Hermosillo. While Trump hasn’t stopped pounding his America First bully pulpit, and the future of NAFTA remains uncertain, “there’s cautious optimism and a hopeful attitude that cooler heads will prevail in Washington,” said Ross Baldwin, chief executive officer of Tacna Services Inc., which facilitates relocations. These three U.S. companies moved jobs to Mexico. Here's why Jim Puzzanghera Brake Parts Inc. had manufactured brake calipers at a factory in the Central Valley community of Chowchilla for nearly 30 years, but a company executive said pressure was growing to reduce costs as competitors moved their factory work to Mexico. About a year ago, employees got the bad news: Operations... Brake Parts Inc. had manufactured brake calipers at a factory in the Central Valley community of Chowchilla for nearly 30 years, but a company executive said pressure was growing to reduce costs as competitors moved their factory work to Mexico. About a year ago, employees got the bad news: Operations... (Jim Puzzanghera) Baldwin has seen the evidence: After business ground to a halt back in November, he’s now juggling two Mexico-bound clients. San Diego-based Tacna helps manage 4,500 workers in Mexico, where factory wages are about a fifth of those in the U.S. That may explain why Mexican manufacturing jobs rose 3.2 percent in January from a year ago as they dropped 0.3 percent in the U.S. The renewed exodus shows how difficult it will be for Trump to turn the macroeconomic tide just by jawboning alone. Last week, he trumpeted a Ford investment in Michigan plants with a cap-lock fanfare: “JOBS! JOBS! JOBS!” The $1.2 billion will create or retain only 130 positions, though. (While Ford canceled plans in November for a new $1.6 billion facility in Mexico, winning Trump’s praise, it employs more than 7,000 workers in that country.) Trump’s plans to renegotiate NAFTA and talk of punitive tariffs can’t erase the need to manufacture in lower-cost countries, said Alan Russell, CEO of El Paso, Texas-based Tecma Group., which also helps open and operate factories in Mexico. European companies tap the Czech Republic for low wages and Asia has Vietnam, and the U.S. needs Mexico to remain competitive with labor-intensive products, he said. “This isn’t about taking jobs from the U.S. — it’s about saving companies,” he said. Ford's bow to Trump benefits robots, not workers Mark Gilbert Ford's decision this week to scrap a $1.6 billion investment in Mexico, following criticism from Donald Trump, shows government intervention can be "good for industry and it's good for employment," according to French presidential candidate Marine Le Pen.

Ford's decision this week to scrap a $1.6 billion investment in Mexico, following criticism from Donald Trump, shows government intervention can be "good for industry and it's good for employment," according to French presidential candidate Marine Le Pen. As far as the workers in this particular... (Mark Gilbert) Russell helped Firstronic LLC open a factory in Juarez in 2014 to make circuit boards for customers including Audi and Tesla Inc. Workers, sporting maroon lab coats and wearing rubber straps on their shoes to ward off static electricity, make about $10 a day running computer-driven machines that insert capacitors and resistors onto green boards and solder them into place. The Juarez expansion — and joint ventures in the Czech Republic and China — was a factor in Grand Rapids, Mich.-based Firstronic winning larger contracts from producers of auto parts and medical supplies, said CEO John Sammut. His sales are surging at a 30 percent annual clip. In Spokane, Triumph Group dismissed almost 80 production workers in January and plans to eliminate another 30 jobs by August as it moves work to Mexican plants, said Steve Warren, a local official of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. “They are being pressured to supply parts as low-cost as possible,” he said. Tapping cheap labor sometimes isn’t just about lowering costs but accelerating growth. Large purchasers, including Kongsberg Automotive and Dura Automotive Systems, prefer to deal with a few global suppliers rather than a myriad of local companies. “If we were only producing in the U.S., we would lose out on the vast majority of the contract opportunities,” Sammut said. With the increase in business, Firstronic has added revenue and jobs in Grand Rapids, he said. Trump promised to bring back coal jobs. That promise 'will not be kept,' experts say.

(Darryl Fears) Businesses haven’t dismissed a NAFTA renegotiation or policies being considered in Washington that might prove costly. A plan by House Republicans to implement a 20 percent border adjustment tax has raised concerns, especially among retailers such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. that import many of their wares. The tax would be applied to sales of imported goods to reduce the U.S. trade deficit, which reached $734 billion in 2016. Trump repeated to a joint session of Congress in February his refrain that that he will make it “much, much harder for companies to leave our country.” But his recent stumbles — travel bans blocked by courts and a health care bill scuttled by his own party — underscore the limitations on presidential power and the difficulty he may have punishing companies or overhauling NAFTA. At a February conference in El Paso to discuss how Trump’s policies may affect trade, most in the room of plant managers, supply-chain officers and suppliers predicted NAFTA would likely be changed but not discarded, and that the changes might not be harmful. Whatever happens, Russell said his business fostering Mexican manufacturing will grow this year. The pressure to reduce costs is that relentless. “When you dissect the worst-case scenarios, it still makes sense to go forward with their business plans,” he said. “It’s a competitive world.” Copyright © 2017, Chicago Tribune Mexico Donald Trump North American Free Trade Agreement Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.

Amazon’s decision to close down Diapers.com leaves unanswered questions. (GeekWire Photo / Kevin Lisota) Amazon’s abrupt announcement last week that it would be shutting down Diapers.com parent Quidsi smells funny to some of the company’s employees. Anonymous sources working for Amazon reportedly told Recode they didn’t totally buy the claim that it was terminating Quidsi because the subsidiary failed to turn a profit. True, as Recode notes, Quidsi hasn’t had a full year of profits in the six years since Amazon bought its once-rival for $545 million. But it has had profitable months here and there and Amazon’s leadership was apparently confident Diapers.com would become profitable before long. Amazon and Quidsi executives reportedly told employees they believed the subsidiary would turn a profit in 2017 at an all-hands meeting at the end of last year. They also said the brand would generate significant free cash flow this year, according to sources cited by Recode. Marc Lore has long been in competition with Amazon. (Walmart Photo) That meeting, combined with the complicated history between Amazon and Diapers.com, is raising some questions. Diapers.com was founded in 2005 by Vinit Bharara and Marc Lore as a “mom-centric retail technology company.” What followed was a fierce price war between Amazon and Diapers.com that led Lore and Bharara to Walmart’s doorstep to discuss the possibility of an acquisition. In a classic, keep-your-enemies-close move, Amazon instead bought Diapers.com. Lore stayed on at Amazon for a few years and then went on to found a competing e-commerce brand Jet.com, which was then gobbled up by Walmart in 2016 for a whopping $3.3 billion. Given the history and the less-than-rock-solid reason Amazon gave for shuttering Diapers.com, it’s unsurprising that many of employees were, well, surprised. It’s possible that Amazon didn’t want to continue operating a business that drove customers to other sites to purchase diapers. Amazon announced it would stop selling its own private-label diapers in 2015, citing a need for design improvements. But Recode floats another, more tawdry hypothesis: Others believe a more unusual reason, claiming it could be some gamesmanship on the part of Bezos intended to send a message to Wall Street, as well as Walmart leadership, that Quidsi co-founder Marc Lore cannot build profitable businesses. Lore is currently the e-commerce chief in the U.S. for Walmart, which paid $3 billion to buy the startup, Jet.com, that he created after leaving Amazon.

No problem, says Amazon. April 3, 2017 | By By Marianne Wilson Amazon has launched a new way for customers to shop its site without using a bank card or credit card.    Called Amazon Cash, the service allows consumers to add cash to their Amazon.com balance by showing a barcode at a participating brick-and-mortar store, with the cash then applied immediately to the consumer’s  online Amazon account.  Notably, Walmart already offers a similar type of service for customers without a credit or debit card, as does PayPal.    The initial retail partners for the service are CVS Pharmacy, Speedway, Sheetz, Kum & Go, D&W Fresh Market, Family Fare Supermarkets, and VG’s Grocery. Other stores will be added in the future, according to Amazon.   Prior to Amazon Cash, which has no fee, consumers who wanted to shop on Amazon without a bank or debit card  had to  buy gift cards or prepaid debit cards.   To use the service, customers show their barcode to the store cashier, and tell them how much cash they want to apply to their Amazon account. The cashier then scans the barcode and the customer pays with their cash.    Login or Register to post a comment. ﻿ Newsletter Sign Up Get the latest news sent to your inbox   Popular Most Commented Sears issues dire warning about its ability to survive First Look: Target’s next-generation store concept Survey reveals retailers with best customer experience Gaming retailer to shutter stores this year as sales drop Walmart debuts updated Neighborhood Market format President-elect hurting traffic at some major retail flagships Dollar Tree comes out on top Restaurant giant in $1.8 billion acquisition German grocery giant to make a big U.S. debut ahead of schedule Study: Retailers leave money on table due to lack of personalized service Solutions Spotlight Taking Stock of Retail’s Analytics Capabilities When it comes to using data and analytics to drive business results, where does the retail industry stand relative to other industries?

Construction Spending Rises 0.8% vs. 1.0% Expectation: Nonresidential Rolling Over? By: Mike Shedlock | Mon, Apr 3, 2017 Share Print Email Construction spending, up 0.8% in February, was a bit weaker than the Bloomberg Econoday Consensus estimate of 1.0%. However, the Census Department revised January from -1.0% to -0.4% so the report was a bit stronger than it appears on the surface. Construction strength is not uniform. Total Construction Spending in Millions of Dollars Total Construction Spending Percent Change From Year Ago Year-over-year residential construction spending is up 6.16% but nonresidential construction is up only 0.95%. Construction Spending by Type Larger Image Multi-family residential is doing much better than single-family. The latter is more important as it hints at family formation. Commercial Spending Commercial spending is a strong indicator of future hiring. As long as Walmart, Target, McDonalds, etc. keep building stores, the economy is likely to keep adding jobs. Nonetheless, spending is still below pre-recession levels. Also, growth in online spending is crushing store spending and minimum wage hikes have taken a bite out of profits as well. How much longer the commercial buildout can keep rolling on remains a key question. Finally, these construction spending reports are very volatile and subject to huge revisions. So take all these numbers with a huge dose of skepticism.     Tweet Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

The Amazon founder is famous for operating retail businesses at such slim margins that rivals can't compete. Quidsi employees had another reason to be surprised. As recently as late 2016, at Quidsi's quarterly all-hands meeting in Jersey City, New Jersey, executives from Amazon headquarters in Seattle spoke to the unit's 250-plus workers and affirmed the parent company's commitment to Quidsi's business, according to multiple people who were in attendance. (Recode previously reported on some details of this meeting.) One of the executives to present was John Boumphrey, Amazon's vice president who oversees baby products, and the direct boss of Quidsi CEO Emilie Arel Scott, said the sources, who asked not to be named because the meeting was confidential. Yet last Wednesday, with the first quarter coming to a close, employees were informed that Amazon was shutting Quidsi down and laying off hundreds of workers, ostensibly because the division was unable to make a profit. The diapers, toiletries, beauty products and pet care items sold by the various Quidsi brands would all be available on Amazon.com, the company said. Not everyone was shocked. Earlier in March, Quidsi's finance chief, Randy Greben, left to become CFO of clothing company Ann Taylor, though as of Monday morning he was still listed as the No. 2 executive on Quidsi's leadership page. One person who spoke to CNBC.com said Greben's departure was a "huge red flag." show chapters Amazon's closure of Quidsi is puzzling to some employees    16 Hours Ago | 00:45 Behind the scenes, the winding down of Quidsi had been quietly underway for over a year. Unlike shoe seller Zappos, which Amazon acquired in 2009 and has flourished as an established independent brand, Quidsi's commodity products play right into Amazon's core business. In the fourth quarter of 2015, Amazon started redirecting inventory from Quidsi's three fulfillment centers -- in Nevada, Kansas and Pennsylvania -- to Amazon's own massive network of warehouses, sources said. That process continued throughout 2016 and is still underway, two people told us. Quidsi's facilities were running out of capacity. The robots that ran through Quidsi's fulfillment centers, pulling goods from shelves and efficiently boxing them up, were owned by Amazon through the 2012 acquisition of robot maker Kiva Systems. Amazon was investing in improving the robots but directing those upgrades primarily to its own facilities, not Quidsi's, sources said. Furthermore, from a customer perspective, Amazon preferred to keep buyers on its own website rather than on Quidsi's network of sites like Diapers.com and Soap.com. With its inventory fleeing to Amazon's warehouses and the Quidsi sites being de-emphasized, there was no longer a strategic reason to have a separate Quidsi operation. "They didn't buy service with Quidsi, they bought domain names and customer lists," said Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities who has a buy rating on Amazon. "It was inevitable that both diapers and soap would be absorbed into Amazon's overall business, as there is no competitive advantage given up by doing so." An Amazon spokesperson declined to comment. Bezos vs. Lore Amazon executives have not mentioned Quidsi on an earnings call since July 2015, and that was only in response to an analyst's question about recent management changes. Amazon's then-CFO Thomas Szkutak said, "We're pleased that business and the team -- our retail team works very closely with the Quidsi business and [we're] excited to have it as part of the Amazon team." Quidsi management has always been a sensitive subject for Amazon and Bezos. Marc Lore co-founded Quidsi in 2005 and waged a tough fight against Amazon in the categories of diapers and toiletries. Amazon responded by slashing prices on diapers, pressuring Quidsi's margins and making investors in the upstart reluctant to pour in more cash. In 2010, a bidding war for Quidsi ensued between Amazon and Wal-Mart, with Bezos ultimately winning with a bid of $545 million. Lore left Amazon and Quidsi in 2013, then turned around and raised billions of dollars for his next venture, Jet.com, a broader e-commerce effort that was originally intended to work on a membership basis, sort of like Costco. Source: Walmart Marc Lore CEO of Jet.com and Doug McMillon CEO of Walmart Wal-Mart bought Jet last year for $3.3 billion, putting Lore in charge of the discounter's e-commerce efforts and pitting him squarely against Bezos. Analysts and former employees said Bezos's personal rivalry with Lore could be one reason why the Amazon CEO shuttered the Quidsi business. Five days after employees were told of the shutdown, Quidsi's website continues to tell a different story. It says the unit has 1,100 employees, a number that presumably includes warehouse jobs, and is "still growing!" As of Monday morning, the site had 16 job listings, including for a buying manager, director of mobile apps and multiple software engineers. We've also asked Amazon how it plans to repurpose Quidsi's fulfillment centers, and haven't yet heard back. Update: After our story ran Amazon appears to have removed the Quidsi website and redirected traffic to Amazon.

Tech Apple Science Cars Samsung Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 Nintendo NES     Nintendo NES Classic Edition In Stock Again At Many Target Stores Posted: Apr 3 2017, 3:27pm CDT | by Luigi Lugmayr, Updated: Apr 3 2017, 10:02pm CDT, in News | Technology News     Here are the latest Nintendo NES Classic restocking updates. Today the Nintendo NES Classic Edition is showing up in stock again at a lot of Target store locations. Amazon continues to offer the NES Classic through Amazon Prime Now. Nintendo has started to ship new NES Classic inventory last week and more stores are offering the NES again. Don't Miss: This is How to Find a Nintendo Switch in Stock To find an NES Classic at Target we recommend using iStockNow and BrickSeek in combination. If both services show that the NES is in stock at a select Target store, the likelihood is higher that this is indeed the case. It is also recommended to look for change in the stock information over time. If a store had zero NES the day before and now shows 12 in stock, then again the likelihood is higher that you find the NES at that store now. Several shoppers shared this morning that they scored a NES Classic at Target. Updated: By 3pm ET, a lot of shoppers report success on finding a NES Classic today at Target. Many failed though as other shoppers got up earlier and snagged up the limited inventory. It got now a bit easier to find a NES Classic, but the demand is still red hot and competition is fierce. We published a new NES Classic Shopping Guide featuring all methods to find and buy a NES Classic. The reseller prices start at $125, plus $3.99 shipping on amazon.com from legit appearing resellers. The first offers in the list on amazon.com are obviously a scam. Nobody is selling a new NES Classic for $23. Please avoid the fake low priced reseller deals on the Nintendo Switch. These offers are a scam that lock up your cash. Read our report on the Nintendo Switch and NES Classic Amazon scam for details. Amazon has been sitting on NES inventory and makes it available in small batches on its local delivery service since a couple weeks now. This is an obvious marketing campaign for Amazon Prime Now. The frequency is though getting higher. Today the NES Classic was available already for New York and San Jose.  Check the NES Classic listing for your Zip code on Amazon Prime Now. Las Vegas was the latest city to that was offered the NES Classic. The local delivery service of Amazon has offered the NES in select cities. The supply is extremely constraint. Shoppers can get notified about the NES Classic availability on Amazon Prime Now with iStockNow. Several resellers offer still the original Nintendo NES Controller for $39.99 on Amazon.com. This is though four times the regular price. There are plenty of 3rd party NES controller that sell for around $10. The NES Classic supply has not improved significantly after months on the market. Target and Walmart stores have been the source of NES hunters a couple weeks ago, but both stores have not gotten significant new inventory in a long time. The last time the NES was on sale on amazon.com for the regular retail price of $59.99 was on Feb. 23. Find all details on how and where to find a NES Classic in stock in our NES Classic Shopping Guide. NES Classic on Amazon Prime Now The only option that has worked in past days is Amazon Prime Now. The local delivery service of Amazon has offered the NES in select cities. The supply is extremely constraint and very sporadic. It is suspicious that only Amazon has the NES in stock and only sells them through Amazon Prime Now. It looks like Amazon set aside some NES inventory to use it to promote its local delivery service. Amazon only allows one NES Classic order per person. There is strict limit on how many NES an account can order for a set period of time, at least 24 hours. Ordering a NES via Amazon Prime Now is though great, but its a hassle to spot one in stock and ready for order. It arrives in 2 hours for free in the cities where Amazon Prime Now is available. NES hunters have to refresh the search for the NES Classic for their ZIP code on a regular basis to spot the NES in stock. About the NES Classic The $59.99 Nintendo NES Classic Edition console launched on November 11 in stores and online. The supply was extremely constraint in stores and especially online. The palm-sized NES console, retailing for $59.99 list price, features the classic Nintendo NES controller many geeks have grown up with. The retro console comes pre-installed with 30 classic NES games including Super Mario Bros., Pac-Man, Metroid, Donkey Kong, The Legend of Zelda and Kirby's Adventures. The NES Classic Edition system is a miniaturized version of the groundbreaking NES, originally released in 1985. The Holiday shopping season 2016 has been dominated by the hunt for Hatchimals and the Nintendo NES classic edition. The NES Classic demand is still strong amidst ongoing shortage. The Best Buy NES Classic and Switch sale on March 29 was worse than a Black Friday sale. We don't expect the sitatution to improve in 2017. The NES Classic will be a hard to find item into the Holiday shopping season 2017. Read the latest NES Classic Updates and see also our Nintendo Switch Shopping Guide.
