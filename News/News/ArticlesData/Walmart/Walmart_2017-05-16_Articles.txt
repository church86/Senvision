Whether those efforts are paying off will be a focal point when Walmart Stores reports quarterly earnings tomorrow. A bit more than half of all funds spent online in the United States now goes to Amazon, according to the bank Macquarie. Part of Amazon's success stems from its breadth of offerings, which includes the Kindle that people use for reading and the Prime service that broadcasts popular television shows, said Krista Fabregas, e-commerce staff writer at FitSmallBusiness.com. “It's because Amazon has been doing such a great job at injecting itself into our everyday life,” she told AFP. “Walmart is not part of everyday life, nor is Macy's, nor is Gap, nor the other stores. We don't have a connection with any of them throughout the day.”   SHOPPNG SPREE Walmart has been doing some shopping of its own, in an effort to make up ground against Amazon. It spent US$3.3 billion last year to buy Jet.com, which was started by e-commerce entrepreneur Marc Lore, whose previous company was sold to Amazon for US$550 million. Lore is now chief executive of Walmart eCommerce US, where he oversees 15,000 employees split between Silicon Valley, Boston, Omaha and Bentonville, Arkansas, where Walmart is based. His annual salary at US$237 million is 10 times that of Wal-Mart chief executive Doug McMillon. In less than five months, Lore has directed Walmart to a number of acquisitions, including Shoebuy.com (US$70 million), ModCloth (US$45 million) and MooseJaw (US$51 million). Walmart is also in talks to acquire the menswear chain Bonobos for US$300 million, according to a person close to the matter. Part of Walmart's objective is to become a go-to place online for 'essential' products, such as toilet paper, beauty products, groceries, holiday gifts and children's toys. “We are focusing on the type of products that customers buy most,” said Walmart spokesman Ravi Jariwala. “We want to make sure that we have the best prices shipping to your home or offering a pickup discount.” Walmart in February scrapped a subscription delivery programme that was a rival to Amazon Prime in favour of a guarantee of free, two-day shipping for orders of more than US$35. Under the programme, customers can also pick up orders free if they go to one of Walmart's 4,700 US stores.   AMAZON KEEPS EDGE These efforts may cut into Amazon's lead in e-commerce, but overtaking Amazon appears unlikely anytime soon. “They have invested heavily on channels. It will restore growth that was necessary for survival,” said Keith Anderson of e-commerce analytics firm Profitero. “I don't see anything that suggests that Wal-Mart would catch up to Amazon or beat Amazon, but it's still very early,” he said. The vigour of Walmart's online investments today contrasts with its initial reticence in e-commerce, which was due to worries that growth of online shopping would cut into sales at brick and mortar stores. Walmart also was slow to introduce platforms for individual vendors who sought a venue for goods and did not introduce such an online marketplace until 2015, long after Amazon. Hannah Donoghue, director of advisory at Planet Retail RNG, said it is still relatively early in the game as far as e-commerce goes. Amazon is “the strongest right now; they are far ahead but there are a lot of innovations underway,” Donoghue said. “I don't think Amazon will be the only one. There will be another strong player.” For now, Wall Street is giving the edge to Amazon, valuing the technology giant at US$453 million, compared with Walmart's US$230 million. That's in spite of Walmart's far greater overall revenues, which were US$485.9 billion in 2016, more than 11 times those of Amazon. ADVERTISEMENT POST A COMMENT HOUSE RULES 1.

Finally, Don-Wesley Andrews had enough. He quit McDonald’s in Sacramento for a job at Wal-Mart. Like many other Americans, the 22-year-old Mr. Andrews improved his life just by moving to retail from fast food. Longer lunch break, paid time off, a quarterly bonus, and no french-fry fragrance on his clothes. “Wal-Mart’s not perfect, but compared to fast food, it’s much, much, much better,” Mr. Andrews said. There’s plenty of talk about the retail industry dying, with malls closing and the slump stressing iconic chains like Sears and J. Crew, but big-box giants such as Wal-Mart and Costco are still chronically in need of employees, at least for now. The number of U.S. retail jobs was about the same last year compared with 2015, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. What’s bedeviling retailers is annual turnover: At 65 percent, it’s the highest since before the Great Recession. The chains are so hungry for good help they’re poaching workers from fast-food restaurants. “Those jobs tend to be more transitional, they tend to be more fluid, and as a result there tends to be higher turnover,” said Michael Harms of Dallas-based researcher TDn2K. “Even though you hear headlines like retail is dying and the robots are coming, there’s still a lot of things that need human touch points. It’s a dogfight over good employees.” Stores  have the edge when it comes to pay. U.S. retail sales workers earn a median $10.37 an hour, while food workers, including those at fast food, make $9.35, according to new data from the BLS. Mr. Andrews said he earns $12.12 an hour at his new job. Perhaps not coincidentally, Wal-Mart, the largest U.S. private employer, added about 200,000 jobs in the last decade. Italian fast-casual chain Fazoli’s is trying to fend off retail, said Dave Craig, vice president of human resources. “It’s a free-for-all right now,” he said. While the firm is paying 20 cents to 30 cents more than last year, its employees still make $9.20 an hour, on average. That’s less than the minimum of $10 an hour Wal-Mart started giving people last year. To retain employees, the chain might nix cotton T-shirt uniforms for a Dri-Fit option that employees don’t have to tuck in. Black jeans are a possibility too. And workers may get paid more often: Fazoli’s is testing a program that gives workers some of their earnings after each shift in a debit card. Boston Market Corp. is buttering up employees too, handing out as much as $100 to those who get the best customer-survey scores. The chicken chain is spending more to advertise jobs on Facebook, Glassdoor, and Twitter and is giving raises. Workers now earn $10.01 an hour, on average, about 75 cents more than last year. Pay increases in fast food are fueled by more than just the competition from retail. Higher minimum wages across the United States, a better economy, and a smaller labor pool to draw from  because of fewer immigrants from Mexico also have an impact. “It’s definitely a war for talent,”said Jason Lessman, Boston Market’s chain’s vice president of human resources.

While international retailers Costco and Walmart have gobbled up a growing share of Canadian food sales for more than a decade, further gains are expected to be tougher to eke out as the country's traditional grocers mount an improved defence.

What is this ? X What is this? Sponsored content is written by Global News' without any editorial influence by the sponsor. If you'd like to learn more... - A A + Listen WINNIPEG — The price gap between traditional grocers and big box stores like Walmart and Costco is beginning to close according to industry analysts. Canadian companies such as Safeway and Superstore are beginning to win over customers with lower prices and loyalty programs which could slow up the sudden rise in grocery sales from Walmart and Costco. “They’ve cut their margins,” retail expert Rob Warren said. “They’ve cut their profitability, but they’ve also cut their costs.” In the past decade, Walmart and Costco have gobbled up a growing share of Canadian food sales, offering some of the best prices in town. Warren said margins are too tight in the grocery industry, so it will be tough for one store to offer noticeably different prices than another. “The grocery store margins are one percent or less,” Warren said. “You know they have to be having the same cost structure and charging the same prices.” Global News went to three major grocery store in Winnipeg to find out for ourselves if the price gap is narrowing. Items like eggs were cheaper at both Superstore and Safeway compared to Walmart. Walmart: $2.93 Superstore: $2.83 Safeway: $2.79 When shopping for cereal, Global News chose to compare prices for Cheerios. The cheapest option was found at Safeway. Walmart: $4.47 Superstore: $4.58 Safeway: $3.99 For a one litre carton of milk, the difference was only pennies with Walmart ringing in slightly cheaper. Walmart: $1.50 Superstore: $1.60 Safeway: $1.58 In 2016, traditional grocers’ market share fell 79.2 per cent compared to 2004 while general merchandisers more than doubled. Industry analysts said it will be tough for big box stores to keep up with the high rise in grocery sales and things will soon slow from Costco and Walmart. Warren said in the future, consumers may not have to go store to store for the best deals. “If you’re going to save ten dollars by running around to three stores, it’s not worth it because you’re going to eat that amount up in gas and time,” Warren said. © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.

Walmart – long the bane of small “Main Street” mom-and-pop shops – may potentially be running into competition problems of its own. Last week, Reuters reported on how German discount supermarket chain Aldi had declared a price war against America’s largest retailer. Then today, more bad news from a major source: The Wall Street Journal reports that another four-letter German discount supermarket, Lidl, will be entering the US market this year and has also put Walmart directly in its sights. Granted, Walmart is essentially a victim of its own success, gobbling up enough market share to make it the prime target of competition. And I’m guessing plenty of the massive brands’ detractors wouldn’t lament its downfall. But Lidl, much like Aldi, isn’t exactly a supermarket savior. Instead, both brands aim to beat Walmart at its own game: low prices. “We feel we'll be able to plug some key gaps that exist,” William Harwood, a spokesman for Lidl US, told the WSJ. Specifically, Lidl wants to focus on inexpensive, high-quality groceries. brightcove-video:5339322759001 Unlike Aldi, who has been in the US market since the ‘70s, Lidl is looking to plug that gap far more rapidly. The chain plans to launch in the US in the next few weeks and open 20 stores in Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina by this summer. Though the brand hasn’t specifically laid out its US expansion intensions yet, Hardwood did say the brand is hoping to open up 80 more stores on the East Coast by the same time next year. Real estate analysts believe another 150 to 200 stores are in the pipeline. Walmart brass looking for reasons to worry don’t have to look any further than the United Kingdom. The WSJ reports that Walmart-owned supermarket Asda has seen sales stall for over four years, losing market share along the way; meanwhile, Lidl and Aldi have seen their share of the grocery pie steadily increase. Still, for the US market, Walmart CEO Doug McMillon doesn’t seem too worried. “We still have some more to address,” he said. “But we are on a path to doing so.” Sounds like the Rollback Smiley may have to put in some overtime shifts.

It offers a full line of Sun Dolphin kayaks, which are manufactured in Muskegon. The fishing isle is equipped with the right stuff to go after any fish one might find in White Lake or Lake Michigan. There's also a full selection of firearms and ammunition.   Whitehall Wal-Mart to open mid-May after year of construction There's also a full scale crafts and sewing section, an automotive department, clothing, home goods, office, outdoor decor, garden, toys, power tools, electronics and more.  The store also features an updated look with new signage, gray polished floors (rather than brown), updated color schemes and lower profile displays for easier access in many departments.  The store is lit with LED light bulbs, and most of its refrigerated and frozen foods are in closed cases for energy efficiency.  So far, the Whitehall Township store has 210 employees, 160 of which are new to the company, Jones said. Hiring began in January, and every associate received 30-60 days of training at established Muskegon County Wal-Mart stores on Sherman Boulevard and Henry Street.   Whitehall Wal-Mart accepting applications for 200 positions The store at 2755 W. Holton-Whitehall Road will open to shoppers shortly after 8 a.m. on Wednesday, May 17. The store will be open 24 hours a day, with more limited hours for the auto center, photo lab, money center, optical center and pharmacy. Construction began on May 25, 2016. It signaled the end of a long, pre-construction legal battle between the Bentonville, Ark.-based company and a local group calling itself BOW NOT -- Back Off Wal-Mart, Not Our Town.   BOW NOT and those who filed the lawsuit -- not all of them close neighbors of the proposed development -- claimed the township's approval of Wal-Mart in August 2013 injured them in several ways.   Construction of controversial Wal-Mart in Whitehall Township underway "Overall, we need to look at this as an opportunity for both Montague and Whitehall and the surrounding area," said Amy VanLoon, White Lake Chamber of Commerce executive director, in a previous statement. "This is a community that has such great potential and by working together, and adjusting to change, we can all help build a strong, vibrant and resilient community."  Wal-Mart has more than 33,000 employees in Michigan, according to the release. During 2016, the company promoted 5,800 associates in the state, and 3,185 were converted from part-time to full-time.   Michigan Prom Prom 2017: Photos from celebrations across Michigan Vote for the best dressed from proms across Michigan - Week 5 Michigan's Best Tell us your favorite Michigan Craft Distilleries, craft cocktails Guide to the craft distilleries of Michigan Holland, Muskegon next on our tour of Michigan Craft Distilleries Distillery partners with breweries for "Beer City Whisky" release More Michigan's Best » Find Local Homes for Sale Apartments Car Dealers Used Cars Jobs Businesses Find a job Buy or sell a car Find a place to live See what's for sale Find a business View obituaries Connect with MLive Subscribe to our newsletters Like us on Facebook Subscribe on YouTube Most Read Active Discussions About Us MLive Media Group Our Team Advertise Frequently Asked Questions Contact Us Jobs at MLive Subscriptions Newspaper | Digital Editions | eNewsletters The Ann Arbor News The Bay City Times The Flint Journal The Grand Rapids Press Jackson Citizen Patriot Kalamazoo Gazette Muskegon Chronicle The Saginaw News MLive Sections News Business Sports High School Sports Entertainment Living Opinion Obituaries Jobs Autos Real Estate Apartment Rentals Classifieds Local Deals Local Businesses Business Resource Center Your Regional News Pages Ann Arbor Bay City Detroit Flint Grand Rapids Jackson Kalamazoo Lansing Muskegon Saginaw Mobile Mobile apps | Tablet apps More on MLive Photos Video Weather Post a job Post a free classified ad Sell your car Sell/Rent your home Apartments and Rentals Sponsor Content Follow Us Twitter | Facebook | YouTube Registration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy © 2017 MLive Media Group.

Analysts believe Wal-Mart’s WMT, -1.55%   earnings will show the company is steady, even as the broader sector staggers into the next quarter. Still, Wal-Mart had to make investments that will show up on its balance sheet to reach those results. Wal-Mart shares have an average hold rating with a price target of $73.87, 3.2% lower than Monday’s close. See also: Retail rundown: Three winners and six losers in the age of Amazon Here’s what to expect: Earnings: Analysts polled by FactSet expect earnings of 96 cents per share, down from 98 cents this time last year. Wal-Mart has beaten the EPS consensus for the past six quarters. Estimize, a software platform that crowdsources estimates from buy-side analysts, hedge-fund managers and others, sees EPS of 97 cents. Revenue: The FactSet sales consensus is $117.8 billion, up from $115.9 billion last year. Same-store sales are expected to increase 1.4%. Wal-Mart has missed the sales consensus for the past two quarters. Estimize also expects sales of $117.8 billion. Share price: Wal-Mart shares are up 9.2% for the past three months, while the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.07%   is up 2.3% for the period and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 1.8% for the past three months. Read: Every time this happens, Amazon crushes another legacy retailer Don’t miss: 20 years after IPO: How Amazon came to dominate books, electronics and the cloud Other issues: UBS analyst Michael Lasser believes Wal-Mart held its own in the first quarter even as it faced pressure from different directions, forecasting a 1.5% same-store sales increase. Strategic price investments helped the retailer to maintain traffic, and there were advancements in the company’s e-commerce business. However, the battle against Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +0.85%   is an expensive one, and should put downward pressure on profits, UBS wrote. “Yet Wal-Mart really has no other choice but to act aggressive,” the note said. “We think it’ll continue to try to realize the advantages of its scale and extensive asset base as it attempts to stand its ground. “The first quarter will probably feature a similar flow of Wal-Mart’s U.S. margin that it exhibited in the fourth quarter,” according to UBS analysts. UBS rates Wal-Mart stock neutral with a $73 price target. See also: Amazon’s next customer: Americans who don’t have a bank account Macquarie Research analysts expect Wal-Mart to sustain its price investments, and forecast a 1.2% increase in same-store sales. “[F]rom a stock perspective, we believe it will take a combination of both positive low-single-digit U.S. same-store sales and U.S. earnings before interest and tax dollar growth to drive the stock higher, and we remain uncertain when we reach this inflection point,” Bob Summers wrote in a Monday note. Macquarie rates Wal-Mart shares neutral with a $61 price target. Analysts at Cowen & Company say they prefer Wal-Mart over Target Corp. TGT, -1.48%   based on the “sustained performance momentum at Wal-Mart on the back of relatively impressive traffic and comps growth versus the rest of retail, while results at Target will likely be pressured given its recent strategic reset,” the firm said in a May 9 note.

Cowen & Company rates Wal-Mart shares outperform with a $77 price target.

Industry watchers say the price gap between the two sides has narrowed and the traditional stores’ loyalty programs are helping support sales. “Every point of market share is hard fought over in the grocery market,” said Kenric S. Tyghe, a consumer and retail analyst at Raymond James. “The traditional grocers have done a better job defending share than, I think, a lot of observers expected.” While they have operated in Canada for years, competition from Costco and Walmart is still top of mind for local grocers given the low-cost strategy of the two foreign giants. In his most recent quarterly call with analysts in April, Metro CEO Eric R. La Fleche discussed Costco’s expansion in Ontario, saying it is “a significant competitor, and we have to execute and differentiate.” In the second quarter of 2004, traditional grocery stores sold about $12.3 billion worth of food, accounting for about 90 per cent of the market, according to Statistics Canada data. General merchandisers, which include Costco and Walmart, sold about $1.3 billion or roughly 9.8 per cent. In the same quarter of 2016, traditional grocers’ market share fell to about 79.2 per cent, while that of the general merchandisers more than doubled. Those changes translate “into billions and billions of dollars every quarter,” said Kevin Grier, an agriculture and food market analyst, adding that the shift in market share to the U.S. chains is expected to slow. “You can’t keep that up,” he said. Canadian grocers were granted some respite from foreign-owned competitors when Target, which entered the Canadian market in 2013, pulled out of the country in 2015. Costco now operates 95 warehouses in Canada, while Walmart runs 410 stores. Costco plans to open three more stores by the end of this year for a total of seven new stores in 2017. Spokesman Ron Damiani said that’s the most sites the company’s opened in a financial year in recent memory. While Walmart has not revealed any new expansion plans, it announced in 2015 it would add 42 supercentre locations. Tyghe said that pace of expansion will not create the sort of disruption and dislocation seen when growth in square footage at the two chains outpaced population increases, forcing Canadian grocers to lower prices. The traditional grocers have also boosted their discount banner store counts, Tyghe said, keeping their hold on the most price-oriented customers. Loblaw, for example, operates 500 discount banner stores, including No Frills, across Canada. “We believe we have some of the strongest, most effectively operated and most customer-centric discount formats in the country,” Loblaw CEO Galen G. Weston said in an interview after the company’s annual meeting earlier this month. For the average Canadian shopper, that means the price difference between a product at a traditional grocer and a Costco or Walmart is not necessarily compelling enough to justify shopping at two separate locations, Tyghe said. “You’re not going to win on price alone,” he said. Another factor favouring traditional grocers is their strong loyalty programs, which give them robust customer data and the ability to target promotional offers to individuals based on their shopping habits, Tyghe said. “How they respond is increasingly in a very data-driven, targeted, promotional way,” he said.

(NYSE:JWN) and J C Penney Company Inc (NYSE:JCP) all put up negative comps. Their stocks were killed, as was the rest of the retail sector. This week, we hear from the biggest retailer of them all in Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE:WMT). Source: Shutterstock I think Walmart’s earnings report will stand in stark contrast to what we heard from the big department stores. Here’s why. Forget Department Stores, Consumers Are Shopping at Walmart Investors should look past the noise from weak department store earnings. WMT stock is down since last week’s poor retail earnings, but I think the market is making a mistake there. Weak sales at traditional mall-focused department stores does not mean weak sales at big box retailers like Walmart. Actually, it looks the two are inversely correlated. Over the last four quarters, the big four department stores (JWN, M, KSS and JCP) have all reported either negative or barely positive comps. Meanwhile, Walmart has reported strongly positive comps (>1%) in each of those quarters, fueled largely by impressive e-commerce growth. In fact, the last time the big four department stores reported positive comps across the board was in February 2016. That was also the last time Walmart’s U.S. comps rose less than 1%. Overall, I actually think the weak department store earnings last week are a bullish signal for WMT stock this week. There is clearly a trend in shopping away from clothing-specific department stores and to off-price, one-stop-shops like Walmart. It looks like that trend sharply accelerated this quarter, and I am bullish on Walmart’s U.S. comps. WMT Stock: All About E-Commerce and Grocery For Walmart stock, the two biggest growth drivers are e-commerce and grocery. And the company grew market share in both those categories last quarter. On the e-commerce front, WMT rolled out “Pickup Discounts” in April. The company is offering discounts on online-only items in order to push the buy-online, pick-up-in-store model. It appears to be working. Web traffic analytics site Quantcast shows that walmart.com has seen a significant year-over-year increase in traffic over the past several months. Google Trends yields similarly bullish data, with search interest related to Walmart also showing strong year-over-year gains. On the grocery front, WMT management has been excited about the growth in that market on the past several earnings calls. And with good reason. As convenience and price continue to dictate consumer shopping decisions, Walmart continues to transition into a fully stocked, omni-channel, off-price one-stop-shop. Grocery is a huge pillar of that transition. This quarter, WMT cut prices on its groceries in 1,200 stores across the Midwest and Southeast. That undoubtedly pressured other grocers and grew Walmart grocery market share. Those price cuts might have pressured sales and margins in the quarter, but I think its more likely that WMT gained more than enough market share to offset those near-term adverse effects.

Blue/Bloomberg From Prices to Patents, Target Is Losing the Battle to Wal-Mart by Matthew Boyle @bizboyle More stories by Matthew Boyle May 16, 2017, 12:27 PM EDT Wal-Mart has edge over its longtime rival across the board ‘This is not your father’s Wal-Mart anymore,’ analyst says For years, Target Corp. had bragging rights over Wal-Mart Stores Inc. in at least one area: cachet. With its sleek products and trendy designers, the company had an edge over Wal-Mart’s bland supercenters, and developed a cult following among customers. That was then. The tumult in U.S. retail with the rise of digital commerce has upended the industry’s natural pecking order, and one casualty has been Target’s cool factor. By a host of measures -- sales, share price, even intellectual property -- Wal-Mart is besting Target with cleaner stores, lower prices and a refurbished online strategy. “This is not your father’s Wal-Mart anymore,” said Chuck Grom, an analyst at Gordon Haskett Research Advisors. As the two retailers prepare to report first-quarter results this week, here’s how they stack up. The rivals’ divergent paths are perhaps best illustrated by same-store sales, a key industry metric. While Wal-Mart’s so-called “comps” have accelerated in recent quarters, Target’s have fallen into negative territory. And they aren’t likely to improve anytime soon, as the company has forecast a low-single digit decline for the full year. Wal-Mart’s sales, in contrast, may rise even further if food deflation subsides, according to Grom, since it generates more than half of its sales from the grocery aisles, compared with more than 20 percent for Target. Another reason for Target’s struggles is that its shoppers just aren’t buying as much, thanks to the growing appeal of online merchants such as Amazon.com Inc., which has made an aggressive push into apparel, a key category for Target. Amazon was the most highly regarded womenswear retailer in the U.S. based on affordability and authenticity, according to a survey from British trend tracker WGSN, while Target was eighth. In the most recent holiday quarter, the value of the average basket of goods at Target declined. Amazon, meantime, surpassed all other brick-and-mortar retailers as the most-popular shopping destination, according to researcher Kantar Retail. To get shoppers spending more, Target plans to introduce a dozen new exclusive brands, hoping to mimic the success of kids’ clothing line Cat & Jack, whose sales now approach $1 billion. It’s also testing next-day delivery of household staples like detergent and paper towels. “Target has lower penetration than Wal-Mart, so they have to get more out of their shoppers,” said Leon Nicholas, an analyst at Kantar. Wal-Mart, meanwhile, is rolling out curbside pickup of online grocery orders to 500 additional U.S. stores this year, eyeing busy suburban moms who don’t want to schlep around a cavernous big-box store. On a recent weekday morning at a Wal-Mart in Rogers, Arkansas, employees began walking the aisles to prepare online orders at 4 a.m. Outside the store, about 10 parking spaces were dedicated for curbside pickup. The company studied fast-food purveyors like McDonald’s Corp. to figure out the best layout for the pickup area. “For Wal-Mart, winning online grocery is mission critical,” said Robin Sherk, an analyst at Kantar. “There’s a lot of work to do there, but online grocery is probably working the best for them.” Target, following the 2013 data breach that exposed personal information of tens of millions of customers, ramped up promotional deals to lure shoppers back in the door. But such deals lead to price tags that swing up and down, confusing shoppers. Wal-Mart has invested billions to reduce its already low everyday prices to battle the encroachment of German hard-discount chains Aldi and Lidl, with a goal of being 15 percent cheaper than the competition on 80 percent of what it sells, according to an internal document obtained by Bloomberg. The result is a widening price gap between Wal-Mart and Target. Wal-Mart is also winning the intellectual property race. During the past five years, it has taken the lead over Target in patent applications, many focused on web development and easing shoppers’ journey through the store. The company has even filed a patent for in-store drones that would ferry products from the backroom to the sales floor. Target’s patents tend to deal with products, display units and shelving, according to researcher CB Insights. Over the past year, the company has jettisoned several long-term innovation projects to focus on its core business, and parted ways with its chief innovation and strategy officer and its chief digital officer. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Walmart Lowering Grocery Prices To Prep For Battle With U.S. Newcomer Lidl Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Walmart Lowering Grocery Prices To Prep For Battle With U.S. Newcomer Lidl Image courtesy of (Mike Mozart) May 16, 2017 1:05 pm EDT By Ashlee Kieler@akieler looking to stay competitive walmart grocery stores lidl aldi competing looking to compete big box store retail Walmart is already engaged in a price war with one Germany-based discount supermarket chain, Aldi, and now it has to prep for competition from a second low-cost German grocer, Lidl, which is set to open its first U.S. stores this summer. The Wall Street Journal reports that Walmart executives are prepping the retailer’s game plan for the arrival of its new competitor by working with suppliers to lower prices, expanding store-brand products, testing new checkout systems, and streamlining overall operations. Competing with Lidl isn’t exactly new for Walmart, whose Asda stores go head-to-head against Lidl and Aldi in Europe. However, Walmart is looking for better results stateside, as the WSJ reports that in the UK, Asda has failed to grow sales for 13 consecutive quarters, while Lidl, along with Aldi, have captured 12% of the market. In order to stay relevant with customers in the U.S. Walmart is appealing to suppliers, asking them to keep their prices low. According to the Journal, vendors have been told that Walmart should be paying 15% less than competitors at least 80% of the time. The demands are similar to those reportedly made by the company back in February when it launched a price comparison test at 1,200 stores in 11 states. The chain’s reported goal with these tests was to find the right price for popular items that will attract more customers and beat competitors, but still earn a profit. The company has also previously outlined changes to its supplier logistics, asking suppliers to ship Walmart’s orders complete and on time, which would let it keep items in stock, avoid unneeded re-orders, and take in an additional $1 billion in sales, benefiting everyone. Walmart is also trying to keep customers in stores by making their trips more convenient. CEO Doug McMillon tells the Journal the retailer is testing a checkout scan-and-go checkout system similar to one already at use in some Sam’s Club stores. Through the test, customers are able to use their phones to scan the barcodes of products they intend to purchase and then check out on their phone as well. Additionally, the company recently added express pharmacy and money service to its mobile app as a way to create a “faster, easier, and more convenient experience” for shoppers. “We still have some more to address,” McMillon told the WSJ. “But we are on a path to doing so.” May 16, 2017 By Ashlee Kieler@akieler looking to stay competitive walmart grocery stores lidl aldi competing looking to compete big box store retail Tell a friend: Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window) Click to email (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Related we loved him in MASH Discount Supermarket Chain Aldi Prepping To Take On Walmart & Others In U.S. new chains Lidl Is The New German Discount Grocer In Town not actual sprouts Albertsons In Talks To Acquire Health Food Market Sprouts creating a retail rival 6 Things We Learned About Walmart’s Love-Hate Relationship With Online Sales how low can you go?

(REUTERS/Rick Wilking) By Reuters May 15, 2017 at 2:04 pm | Print View Two former Wal-Mart Stores Inc. employees have filed a lawsuit accusing the retailer of treating thousands of pregnant workers as “second-class citizens” by rejecting their requests to limit heavy lifting, climbing on ladders and other potentially dangerous tasks. The proposed class action lawsuit was filed in federal court in Illinois on Friday by Talisa Borders and Otisha Woolbright, who say that until 2014, Arkansas-based Wal-Mart had a companywide policy that denied pregnant women the same accommodations as workers with other disabilities. The class action could include at least 20,000 women and possibly up to 50,000 who worked at Wal-Mart while pregnant before the policy change, according to the lawsuit. A Wal-Mart spokesman on Monday said the company had not seen the lawsuit and did not have any comment. Borders and Woolbright say that Wal-Mart’s old policy violated a federal law requiring employers to treat pregnancy as a temporary disability and provide work accommodations to pregnant women. The U.S. Supreme Court, in a 2015 case involving the United Parcel Service, said employers cannot treat pregnant workers differently from those with other disabilities or medical conditions. Wal-Mart, the largest private U.S. employer, changed its policy in 2014 to treat pregnancy as a disability. But lawyers for the plaintiffs in the lawsuit say the changes did not go far enough, and they were planning a separate lawsuit involving the new policy. Woolbright said her manager at a Florida Wal-Mart told her pregnancy was “no excuse” for not doing heavy lifting. She says she was fired from her job in the deli department after injuring herself lifting trays that weighed up to 50 pounds and inquiring further about the company’s pregnancy policies. Borders, who worked at an Illinois Wal-Mart, said she was reprimanded for asking co-workers to climb ladders and lift heavy boxes while she was pregnant, and forced to go on unpaid leave. When she returned, she said, she was paid $2 less per hour. Like what you're reading?

We like this definition. Companies Vs Climate Change (CvCC) is proud to announce that Zach Freeze of Walmart will be a keynote speaker at our Nov 29-Dec 1 event at the Hyatt Regency Miami.  CvCC’s singular mission is to unite the world’s companies around climate solutions and it speaks volumes that a company such as Walmart has chosen this event to share their vision for this critical area. Conference website: www.solveclimatechange.com “As the first retailer with a science-based target to reduce emissions, Walmart understands the importance of incorporating the utility of sustainable business practices in our business,” said Zach Freeze, Senior Director for Sustainability at Walmart. “The Companies vs. Climate Change Conference is a noteworthy initiative that signals continued support for progress on emission reductions and provides a forum for like-minded companies to collaborate on our sustainability goals.”       During his decade-long tenure at Walmart, Freeze has played an instrumental role in the development and rollout of Project Gigaton, an initiative that will provide an emissions reduction toolkit to a broad network of businesses seeking to eliminate one gigaton of emissions – the equivalent to taking more than 211 million passenger vehicles off of U.S. roads and highways for a year – by 2030.  “We are proud of the improvements we’ve made in reducing our own emissions and we seek to do more to inspire progress in our value chain. That’s why we’re working with our suppliers and others on Project Gigaton. Through the years, we’ve seen that integrating sustainable practices into our operations improves business performance, spurs technological innovation, inspires brand loyalty, and boosts employee engagement.

Walmart To Pay $7.5M After Denying Spousal Benefits To Same-Sex Couples Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Walmart To Pay $7.5M After Denying Spousal Benefits To Same-Sex Couples Image courtesy of Joe Gratz May 16, 2017 10:30 am EDT By Chris Morran@themorrancave cover me insurance health insurance gender discrimination lawsuits walmart retail A federal court judge has approved a $7.5 million settlement between Walmart and current and former employees who claimed that the the retailer unfairly discriminated against them by denying health benefits to their same-sex spouses. The lead plaintiff in the case, a Massachusetts woman who began working at Walmart in 1999, said she repeatedly attempted to add her wife to her Walmart-sponsored insurance plan, but was told the company had a policy of not insuring same-sex couples. As a result she claimed that her wife had to purchase more expensive insurance on the individual marketplace — coverage that was lost while the spouse was undergoing costly treatments for ovarian cancer. Even after the Supreme Court struck down the Defense of Marriage Act in 2013, opening up federal tax and insurance benefits to same-sex couples, the plaintiff said that Walmart still maintained its policy of denying benefits to same-sex spouses. Walmart eventually changed its policy in 2014, but by then the plaintiff said her family had tallied $150,000 in medical debt because of the retailer’s refusal to offer the same benefits available to male-female married couples. The employee filed a complaint with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which determined in Jan. 2015 that Walmart had discriminated against her based on gender, since the health insurance she sought “would be provided if she were a woman married to a man.” She then brought this lawsuit [PDF] against her employer, alleging violations of federal civil rights law and state employment laws, and seeking to represent other Walmart workers who had similarly been denied coverage for their spouse. Walmart and the plaintiff reached a settlement [PDF] in April that would pay out a total of $7.5 million to the whole plaintiff class. The judge in the case approved the settlement on Monday. Once the attorneys have been paid, the more than 300 or so plaintiffs will split the remaining $5.5 million. U.S. District Judge William G. Young said the award is fair and reasonable, reports the Boston Globe. “This was a carefully crafted and sensible resolution of a complex matter, and it reflects well on the parties from both sides,” he said from the bench on Monday. The settlement also ensures that Walmart won’t revert to its prior policy of excluding same-sex spouses from its health insurance plan. The lead plaintiff said in a statement that she’s pleased Walmart has resolved the issue for her and others who are in same-sex marriages. “It’s a relief to bring this chapter of my life to a close,” she said. Walmart also said it’s happy that both sides could reach a resolution. “We will continue to not distinguish between same and opposite sex spouses when it comes to the benefits we offer under our health insurance plan,” Sally Welborn, senior vice president for the company, said in a statement.

The case is known as Jacqueline Cote v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc, No. 15-cv-12945-WGY (D. Mass).  The settlement will pay for claims by Walmart associates in the United States and Puerto Rico that they were unable to obtain health insurance coverage for their same-sex spouses from Walmart from Jan. 1, 2011 to Dec. 31, 2013. It also covers the costs of administering the settlement and legal fees and expenses. In 2014, Walmart voluntarily made the same health insurance benefits available to same-sex spouses of its associates that it offered to opposite-sex spouses. As part of the proposed settlement, Walmart commits to continuing to do so in the future. The settlement class is expected to include no more than a few thousand current and former Walmart associates. Walmart employs nearly 1.5 million associates in the U.S. and Puerto Rico. Sally Welborn, Senior Vice President, Global Benefits for Walmart, said, "We're happy both sides could come together to reach a resolution. Respect for the individual, diversity and inclusion are among the core values that made Walmart into the company that it is today. We will continue to not distinguish between same and opposite sex spouses when it comes to the benefits we offer under our health insurance plan." Cote said, "I'm pleased that Walmart was willing to resolve this issue for me and other associates who are married to someone of the same sex. It's a relief to bring this chapter of my life to a close." Cote is represented by GLBTQ Legal Advocates & Defenders (GLAD), Outten & Golden LLP, the Washington Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights & Urban Affairs (WLC), and Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer LLP. Janson Wu, GLAD's Executive Director, said, "This is an important settlement for LGBTQ workers." Juno Turner, a Partner at Outten & Golden LLP, said, "We are pleased that class members had the opportunity to receive compensation." Peter Romer-Friedman, a Counsel at Outten & Golden LLP, said, "We are glad that as part of the settlement Walmart will continue to provide the same health insurance benefits regardless of the gender of the associate's spouse." Jonathan Smith, the WLC's Executive Director, said, "We believe the settlement is fair and reasonable and are pleased that the Court approved it today. We are pleased to have worked with our colleagues at GLAD, Outten & Golden, and Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer to achieve this settlement."

(Robert Kirkham/Buffalo News) By Stephen T. Watson Published Tue, May 16, 2017 SHARE TWEET EMAIL WS Development has a picture on its website of a bustling shopping plaza in Amherst with two rows of shops lining a packed parking lot. The Massachusetts-based developer calls it a "highly visible retail destination" that hosts the region's only Whole Foods. The reality at the former Northtown Plaza is far different. Although Whole Foods is under construction and is scheduled to open this summer, most of Northtown's storefronts sit empty. Six tenants remain, including a hair salon and a butcher shop. "The plaza definitely needs to have some life breathed back into it," said Michael Baer, who, with his wife, owns the Northtown Plaza Fantastic Sams and three other salons in the area. As shopping centers across the country struggle and online retailing grows, shoppers wonder what will happen to one of the region's oldest and most visible retail centers. WS Development, a major national owner of shopping centers, bought the Northtown Plaza two years ago and initially talked about spending as much as $75 million to transform it. [Gallery: What's the future of Northtown Plaza?] The developer has nudged out tenants that don't fit with its vision – not an unusual step when an owner attracts a new anchor store and rebuilds a center. Observers expect the company will tear down existing stores to make way for new tenants. But so far the company isn't saying much about what it intends to do. The developer declined an interview request. "We continue to refine plans for the future phases of redevelopment and look forward to sharing details in the future," Sherri D'Alessandro, a WS Development spokeswoman, said in an email. The lack of action makes locals nervous. "I wish I understood. I wish they would talk to somebody," said Natalie Neumann, owner of Riverside Men's Shop, which moved this month from the plaza to a new store in Depew. Natalie Neuman, left, owner of Riverside Mens Shop, discusses their on-going move from Northtown Plaza with her store manager Joe Jacobi at their Northtown Plaza location on Wednesday, April 19, 2017 in Amherst, N.Y. (Robert Kirkham/Buffalo News)Plaza sold for $18.5 million When WS Development came to Amherst, the two rows of stores and retail space that make up the Northtown Plaza largely were filled. But over the last two years, restaurants, service outlets and mom-and-pop retail shops have moved or closed. The Erie County Auto Bureau left for a plaza in the Town of Tonawanda. The Screening Room movie theater decamped to the Boulevard Mall. My Tomato Pie opened a new restaurant in north Amherst. C-K Nail and Spa was the latest to clear out, reopening around the corner at 1060 Niagara Falls Blvd., in the last couple of weeks. Six businesses remain: Treats Unleashed pet store, Federal Meats, KeyBank, Payless ShoeSource, Fantastic Sams and the women's clothing store Mabel Danahy. Located near the heavily trafficked corner of Sheridan Drive and Niagara Falls Boulevard, the plaza was built on farmland 65 years ago. WS Development paid $18.5 million in 2015 for the 19-acre plaza, which has 375,000 square feet of space, or twice the size of the Walmart Supercenter on Sheridan Drive. WS Development has a track record of success. The company, for example, paid $45 million in 2013 for Hyde Park Village, a six-block commercial development in Tampa, Fla., and has brought in a trendy mix of national and local retailers, such as preppy clothing store Vineyard Vines, according to the online magazine 83 Degrees. But at Northtown, the only sign of progress in the plaza is the construction on the $15 million Whole Foods, where work began last summer. WS Development at one time approached the Amherst Industrial Development Agency about obtaining tax breaks to subsidize the cost of the development. Under agency policy, retail stores don't qualify for tax breaks but "tourist destinations" do. David S. Mingoia, the agency's executive director, said IDA officials tried to steer the developer toward converting the plaza to a mixed-use development. The developer has offered to buy out Baer, who has a lease that runs through 2023. He said he is in negotiations to exit the Northtown Plaza and move to a building near the plaza. Federal Meats, an original tenant in the plaza, has a month-to-month lease but hasn't had much communication with WS Development. It's not easy to move a butcher shop, because of all of the coolers and the display cases, said Patrick Patterson, the store manager. But he said he knows that day is coming as Whole Foods gets closer to opening. "That's the last thing they want is any competition," said Patterson. As other tenants left the plaza over the past two years, business became "extremely challenging" for Riverside Men's Shop, said Neumann. "The bright side? Plenty of parking," quipped Tom Lanighan, the store's sales manager. The Whole Foods store under construction at Northtown Plaza on Wednesday, April 19, 2017. (Robert Kirkham/Buffalo News) Whole Foods plans Plans filed with the town for Whole Foods show typical features, such as a bakery and extensive space for prepared foods. But the Amherst Whole Foods also would boast a casual restaurant serving food and beer, a bocce ball court and a "living wall" of plants on the roof. Amherst Whole Foods to feature bocce court, tap room Whole Foods and WS have said the store will be ready to open this summer. Representatives of both companies declined last week to provide an update on the construction. Nationally, the organic grocery chain is mired in a prolonged sales slump and is under pressure to draw in new shoppers and shake off its reputation for high prices. Whole Foods used to dominate the natural and organic food marketplace, but Kroger and even Walmart have jumped into that space nationally, said Chuck Lindsey, an associate professor in the University at Buffalo marketing department. "They're not the only game in town anymore," he said. The company has scaled back expansion plans across the country, Lindsey said, but so far has not said the Amherst store is affected. "Things are still on track," Ted Kwong, a Whole Foods spokesman, said in an email. Competition nearby The clearing out of the Northtown Plaza comes at a time of growth – and uncertainty – for major retail centers along the Niagara Falls Boulevard-Sheridan Drive axis. Boulevard Consumer Square, the shopping plaza 1½ miles north of the Northtown Plaza, recently added Nordstrom Rack. The Boulevard Mall still has its Macy's and JCPenney anchors but lost Sears earlier this year. Six years ago, BJ's Wholesale Club moved into a long-vacant storefront in the 23-acre TJ Maxx plaza at Sheridan and Niagara Falls Boulevard.  And a Walmart moved into the former Hills-Ames plaza at Sheridan and North Bailey Avenue. "You look down that street, it's a big improvement from what it was 10 years ago," said David Schiller, associate broker with Pyramid Brokerage Co., which has listed the former Boulevard Mall Sears. A smaller-scale example of a retail revival on Sheridan is Benderson Development's Piccadilly Plaza, at North Bailey. That's where the Taste of India restaurant moved after leaving Northtown Plaza. Benderson bought the plaza in late 2015 and started fixing up the exteriors of the storefronts and making other renovations late last year, said Eric Recoon, a vice president of development and leasing. Benderson built new standalone buildings for Starbucks, Sleep Number and Dickey's BBQ. "We felt very strongly about the underlying real estate – fantastic location – but a meaningful investment was needed to bring it to a standard we feel comfortable with, as well as to attract new national tenants," Recoon said. Back at Northtown, as Patterson offered made-from-scratch chicken noodle soup to a visitor to Federal Meats, he said he looks forward to seeing something happen. "If they do what they say they're gonna do," he said, "it'll be quite a destination." --- Stores that closed or moved from Northtown Plaza after WS Development bought it in 2015 Gi-Ro Cleaners Cutting Edge Sports Training Shoppers' Choice Close-Out Bargain Stores My Burger Bar Riverside Men's Shop S+E Jewelers Falafel Bar My Tomato Pie Taste of India Erie County Auto Bureau Plato's Closet Clothes Mentor Goldmaster Studios Carolina Furniture Screening Room C-K Nails + Spa Click here to see the comments.

Industry watchers say the price gap between Canadian grocers and international retailers Costco and Walmart has narrowed and the traditional stores’ loyalty programs are helping support sales.  (Nathan Denette / THE CANADIAN PRESS)   By Aleksandra SaganThe Canadian Press Tues., May 16, 2017 While international retailers Costco and Walmart have gobbled up a growing share of Canadian food sales for more than a decade, further gains are expected to be tougher to eke out as the country’s traditional grocers mount an improved defence. Industry watchers say the price gap between the two sides has narrowed and the traditional stores’ loyalty programs are helping support sales. “Every point of market share is hard fought over in the grocery market,” said Kenric Tyghe, a consumer and retail analyst at Raymond James. “The traditional grocers have done a better job defending share than, I think, a lot of observers expected.” While they have operated in Canada for years, competition from Costco and Walmart is still top of mind for local grocers given the low-cost strategy of the two foreign giants. In his most recent quarterly call with analysts in April, Metro CEO Eric La Fleche discussed Costco’s expansion in Ontario, saying it is “a significant competitor, and we have to execute and differentiate.” Article Continued Below In the second quarter of 2004, traditional grocery stores sold about $12.3 billion worth of food, accounting for about 90 per cent of the market, according to Statistics Canada data. General merchandisers, which include Costco and Walmart, sold about $1.3 billion or roughly 9.8 per cent. In the same quarter of 2016, traditional grocers’ market share fell to about 79.2 per cent, while that of the general merchandisers more than doubled. Those changes translate “into billions and billions of dollars every quarter,” said Kevin Grier, an agriculture and food market analyst, adding that the shift in market share to the U.S. chains is expected to slow. “You can’t keep that up,” he said. Canadian grocers were granted some respite from foreign-owned competitors when Target, which entered the Canadian market in 2013, pulled out of the country in 2015. Costco now operates 95 warehouses in Canada, while Walmart runs 410 stores. Costco plans to open three more stores by the end of this year for a total of seven new stores in 2017. Spokesperson Ron Damiani said that’s the most sites the company’s opened in a financial year in recent memory. While Walmart has not revealed any new expansion plans, it announced in 2015 it would add 42 supercentre locations. Tyghe said that pace of expansion will not create the sort of disruption and dislocation seen when growth in square footage at the two chains outpaced population increases, forcing Canadian grocers to lower prices. The traditional grocers have also boosted their discount banner store counts, Tyghe said, keeping their hold on the most price-oriented customers. Loblaw, for example, operates 500 discount banner stores, including No Frills, across Canada. “We believe we have some of the strongest, most effectively operated and most customer-centric discount formats in the country,” Loblaw CEO Galen Weston said in an interview after the company’s annual meeting earlier this month. For the average Canadian shopper, that means the price difference between a product at a traditional grocer and a Costco or Walmart is not necessarily compelling enough to justify shopping at two separate locations, Tyghe said. “You’re not going to win on price alone,” he said. Another factor favouring traditional grocers is their strong loyalty programs, which give them robust customer data and the ability to target promotional offers to individuals based on their shopping habits, Tyghe said. “How they respond is increasingly in a very data-driven, targeted, promotional way,” he said.

Walmart investigates note found recounting forced labor in China; includes company's statement Author: Sébastien Malo, Thomson Reuters Foundations, Published on: 16 May 2017 Giant U.S. retailer Wal-Mart Stores Inc said on Wednesday it is looking into the origins of a note describing forced labor conditions in China that a customer claimed to find in a purse bought at a store in Arizona. The note detailed long hours, beatings and malnourishment of workers at a prison in the Chinese region of Guangxi, according to the customer's family who contacted local media... "We're making contact with the customer and appreciate her bringing this to our attention. With the information we have, we are looking into what happened so we can take the appropriate actions," Ragan Dickens, a Wal-Mart spokesman, said...The customer told local media late last month that the note was hand-written in Chinese but she had it translated into English three times...

(GuruFocus) Traditional retailers are gearing up to take on the rivalry posed by online behemoth Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN). As a step in the right direction, Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE: WMT) announced in a blog last week it's testing new approaches in two recently owned supercenters in Tomball, Texas, and Lake Nona, Florida. This is in a bid to appeal to customers, who are increasingly taking to digital-driven lifestyles. Scan & Go: Valuing Customers' Time Realizing customer time constraints, Wal-Mart has begun testing Scan & Go technology, which works both on personal smartphones and Wal-Mart provided handheld devices. The Scan & Go wands and digital produce scales are available on the way into the store. A customer can pick up a scanner from a rack near the door and go about the store, picking up items he wants to purchase. The customer scans the items and then puts them into the shopping bags. At the checkout, the customer needs to point the scanner at the kiosk, pay using the card and he will be done. "The Scan & Go fast pass checkout lanes allow customers to bypass the traditional checkout process, which makes a quick trip faster than ever," Wal-Mart said. The 5–7 minutes it takes to checkout with a cashier now shrinks to 32 seconds, an ABC report said. How Does Scan & Go Compare To Amazon Go Stores? Amazon began testing Amazon Go stores late last year in Seattle for groceries purchases in brick-and-mortar stores. The small-store concept was supposed to serve as small convenience stores rather than as a bigger grocery store. Though Amazon said the store concept would go live in early 2017, the rollout appears to be courting a delay. The Go store concept works like this: Customers are provided with access to the stores after they wipe their Amazon Go App. Customers can go around shopping and scan the items they plan to buy using their smartphones and then walk out without having to wait in checkout queues. The items they place back after picking up will be deducted from their shopping cart. The bill or receipt will be sent via email. A Forbes article, quoting a report, suggests that the buying process in the Go stores breaks down if more than 20 people shop in the marketplace at a time. Once more customers enter the store or when they slow their movements, Amazon's technology can't easily track them and the purchasing process breaks down, the report said. Apart from Scan & Go, Wal-Mart is also testing other boosted convenience approaches, such as: New Layout: The company reimagined the layout based on customer shopping behavior. Services such as beauty salon and tech repairs were placed adjacent to relevant merchandise. Smart Life: New interactive projection technology allows customers to learn about connected devices such as Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL)'s Google Home, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL)'s TV, Nest, baby monitors and connected thermostats. Integrated Pickup: Shoppers can use the outside drive-thru to pick up not just their weekly groceries, but also their prescriptions and Walmart.com orders. Extended Aisles: Interactive screens offer access to an extended curated selection of online-only items in almost 100 categories. Customers can order products, pay with the rest of their basket at checkout and pick up two days later. Appointment Setting: This allows placement of orders, an interlude of time, and then the order pick up.

Tech Apple Science Cars Samsung Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 Nintendo NES E3     Nintendo Switch Stock Updates For Tuesday, May 16 Posted: May 16 2017, 4:18am CDT | by Luigi Lugmayr, in News | Technology News     The latest Nintendo Switch stock tracking information for online and in stores for Tuesday, May 16th. The Nintendo Switch console is available online only as part of bundles. GameStop has replaced the three Switch bundles the video game retailer offered last week on the weekend with three completely new Nintendo Switch bundles. Target is now also offering a Nintendo Switch bundle online at target.com. Don't Miss: Nintendo Switch with Gray Joy-Con in Stock Online The GameStop Nintendo Switch bundles are the only option to buy a Nintendo Switch online on Monday.  Shoppers can track the availability of the four Nintendo Switch bundles with our new app The Tracker. Check the availability of the Nintendo Switch Neon Joy-Con Digital Bundle, Nintendo Switch Gray Joy-Con Bundle, Nintendo Switch Neon Joy-Con Physical Bundle and the new Nintendo Switch Gray Joy-Con Starter Bundle. This week the Nintendo Dock Set will ship and also new Nintendo Switch games will be released. Every new Switch game release is still a highlight as the catalog of available Switch games is still very limited.  Nintendo believes the Nintendo Switch will be as big as the extremely successful Nintendo Wii. Looking at the current shortage, the Japanese video game maker has a long road ahead of them to ship 101 million Nintendo Switch consoles. The positive reception and praise of the Nintendo Switch fuel the demand for the mobile and home console hybrid. Nintendo is also busy marketing the Nintendo Switch with hands-on events and at the E3 2017. Find below the latest Nintendo Switch online availability updates and stock tracking updates for stores. Nintendo Switch Stock at Online Stores On Monday the Nintendo Switch is available online as part of three new bundles starting at $484.99 online at gamestop.com.  Target's Nintendo Switch bundle on offer at target.com sells for $499.99. It is rather attractive bundle including Pro Controller, Zelda, Mario Kart and a bag. The Switch bundle at Target ships now, while the three GameStop offers ship May 26. The Nintendo Switch has been on sale on Friday, May 11 again at 5pm ET. Walmart's Nintendo Switch flash sale was over in minutes.  The Switch was available as a custom bundle. Through the Walmart app the $299 Switch consoles have been available too. To get an notification when Walmart is again selling the Nintendo Switch online try our new Tracker app. The Switch is extremely hard to score on Friday a walmart.com. A lot of successful orders got cancelled afterwards as Walmart sold more than they had available. It is a headscratcher why Walmart's shopping platform is not able to keep sales and stock in sync. Amazon in the UK is offering the Nintendo Switch with Gray Joy-Con with an in stock date of May 25. The price of the UK import comes to $332.22 with 5 day shipping.  At this point no online retailer is selling the $299.99 Nintendo Switch consoles. The Nintendo Switch will continue to be hard to find for the foreseeable future. Nintendo plans to ship 10 million consoles world-wide in the time from April 2017 to April 2018. From the launch on Mach 3 to April 27, the Mario company sold 2.74 million Switch consoles. Online stores restocked the $299.99 Nintendo Switch with Gray Joy-Con and the $299.99 Nintendo Switch with Neon Joy-Con in time for the launch of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe on April 28. Since then the Switch console was out of stock online, besides the TRU bundle offer, according to data from The Tracker. The Nintendo Switch reseller markups keep steady and range today between $90 to $110 for the Nintendo Switch with Gray Joy-Con and $100 to $130 for the Nintendo Switch with Neon Joy-Con on amazon.com. The Nintendo Switch with Neon Joy-Con is more rare than the console with Gray controllers, resulting in considerable higher market value. Overall the Nintendo Switch market prices have risen slightly. To find Nintendo Switch in stock online, shoppers can use our new The Tracker app, available as free download for iOS and Android.  There are also several new accessories coming on the market from Nintendo in the next weeks. See the full list of new Nintendo Switch accessories. When is Nintendo Switch in stock online again? Nintendo is ramping up the production for the Nintendo Switch, but has not disclosed what the current production capacity per month is. The demand for the Nintendo Switch will spike during the Holiday Shopping season 2017. Nintendo will set aside a large part of the Switch production during the next months for November and December. This stock piling will keep the Nintendo Switch in short supply during the next 5 months. As Nintendo coordinated new Switch console shipment with the launch of Mario Kart 8, we expect the company to do the same for the next major Switch game launches. This means the next big wave of new Switch consoles comes in mid-June for the release of ARMS. The Nintendo Switch will likely be offered in special bundles in time for the Holidays. A Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Switch bundle has already surfaced in Russia. Because of the incredible demand for the Switch console, the monetary savings on these bundles will be limited. Usually bundles offer a way for consumers to get a free game. Nintendo can afford to just offer some savings, unless the demand is slowing down. Read the latest Nintendo Switch news. How to find a Nintendo Switch in Stock Online We developed the The Tracker app to make finding stock of rare products online as easy and stress free as possible. Download the free app for Apple iPhone or Android phones. From the list products you select to be notified for the Switch with Grey Joy-Con and/or Neon Joy-Con. That is it. It is set and forget. At the moment we detect the Nintendo Switch console in stock at major online retailers, you receive a notification on your smartphone. Now you are just a tap away from buying a Nintendo Switch. You can also see the current availability of the Nintendo Switch consoles in the web version of The Tracker: Nintendo Switch with Gray Joy-Con, Nintendo Switch with Neon Joy-Con. Nintendo Switch in Stock at Stores GameStop is restocking the Nintendo Switch since Thursday in stores too. The Nintendo Switch is also only available as part of bundles at GameStop retail locations. The Nintendo Switch is available in 585 Walmart stores, 185 Target stores, 19 GameStop locations according to the Nintendo Switch inventory tracker iStockNow (5:15am ET). The number of stores stayed basically the same compared to Monday, which is not a good sign. It is still early and new inventory could still arrive at stores later this morning. The Nintendo flagship store in New York said on April 28 in a tweet to have the Nintendo Switch in stock each morning. People in New York or visitors can give this purchase option a try. Social media posts from people who visited the flagship store confirm the availability of the Switch at the Nintendo store in New York. Some even report that they saw the Switch still on the shelves late afternoon. Read the latest Nintendo Switch news.

A clip shows the actor pretending that he feels suicidal halfway through the call, which prompts the scammer to say: 'I love you. Stay on.' Mr Bingham finally unleashes hell in a scathing rant at the end of the video, telling the scammer he is an 'inebriated dog s***' who will 'burn in hell'. Actor Ashton Bingham got epic revenge on an IRS scam-caller by pretending to go to a Walmart, giving false card details and even asking the scammer to go to lunch with him 902010 star Ashton Bingham, of Studio City, Los Angeles, was ordered to pay $5,680 in unpaid tax - and decided to go along with it The video begins with Mr Bingham, from northern Nevada, holding out his mobile, which is on speakerphone. 'We have called to inform you about a lawsuit filed in your name, sir. Do you file your taxes by own or do you have anyone else filing your taxes?' the scammer asks. 'Oh, I've never been to Texas?' He replies sardonically. 'I will go ahead and read all the charges against your name, but before I do that do not interrupt me as I will give you a fair time to speak, alright?  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Shocking moment cruel nanny SLAPS a toddler in the face is...

Share this article Share 116 shares Grinning with mischief, the Parks And Recreation star interrupts to say: 'Okay.' The scammer claims that the actor needs to pay around $4,800 in unpaid tax and threatens that the IRS has issued an arrest warrant.  'Oh noooo,' Mr Bingham replies in mock-horror.   The scammer then transfers him to a 'senior investigating officer'. The next man seems to be feeling optimistic about his chances, and bumps up the amount of unpaid tax to $5,680. 'I'm a little strapped on funds at the moment because I have a lot of medical bills and I went to the doctor six months ago and I was diagnosed with Plumber's crack,' Mr Bingham claims. The scammer threatens that the IRS has issued an arrest warrant for Mr Bingham, to which he replies in mock-horror 'Oh nooooo' A clip shows the actor pretending that he feels suicidal and wants to kill himself halfway through the call, prompting the scammer to urge: 'I love you. Stay like this forever' The scammer persists: 'Do you have the $5,680 or not?' 'Yeah I do, I was gonna go to Knott's Berry Farm [theme park in California] but I guess I can just cancel that. So yeah I have it,' Mr Bingham trails off sadly.  He is then transferred to a third 'senior investigating officer', who demands that Mr Bingham transfer the money 'by himself'. 'By myself? Can I bring my dog?' he asks. 'Why would you want to bring your dog?' the scammer shoots back furiously, to which he replies: 'Well, I'm just a little scared and he's a service animal.' 'Sir, this is a recorded line, what are you talking about sir?' the scammer blusters. The scammer then orders him to go to a Walmart store to drop off the money. Mr Bingham blags: 'Yeah, I'm almost there. I'm walking up to the parking lot. This really sucks you know, all these horrible things happening. 'I don't know man, I'm just - I'm just starting to lose my will to be alive, you know. Like sometimes I feel like I need to like, end it, you know?' There is a pause on the end of the line, before the scammer tentatively responds: 'You're just a smart guy, man.' Mr Bingham then pretends to go to a Walmart, at which point the scammer seems to realise he is being played and tries desperately to get the actor to take out $500  Getting increasingly desperate, he adds: 'I love you. I love the way you are. Stay like this forever okay? Stay on.' Mr Bingham then asks in a quivering voice: 'Really? You don't think I should kill myself?' When the scammer replies that he shouldn't, the actor ventures: 'Oh. Can we hang out after I get this settled? Do you like lunch? Do you eat lunch?' 'I don't know,' the baffled scammer replies, to which Mr Bingham says dejectedly, 'Oh, you don't eat lunch.' When the actor claims he is in Walmart, the scammer finally seems to catch on and starts laughing bitterly. 'You're a smart guy, man. Do you have money or not? Get a card of $500,' he says. He then changes his mind, saying: 'Why don't you get me $100 then.' Mr Bingham wastes even more time by asking if he should also buy a Walmart gift card.  The scammer seems on the verge of hanging up, when the actor says: 'OK, I'm ready, I have the card.' As he reads out the fake numbers, the scammer yells: 'Sir, do you think I am a fool?' 'No, I think you're a c*** sucking, lint-licking piece of inebriated c*** sucking dog s***. That's what I think,' Mr Bingham finally vents. As he reads out the fake numbers, the scammer yells: 'Sir, do you think I am a fool?' 'No, I think you're a c*** sucking, lint-licking piece of inebriated c*** sucking dog s***. That's what I think,' Mr Bingham finally vents 'You're gonna burn in hell, because you're a stupid motherf****** scamming motherf***.' The other end of the line then bursts into static as the scammers start furiously shouting in a different language. 'Hello? F***face?' asks Mr Bingham, before shrugging and hanging up. Amused viewers praised the video in their droves, with one writing: 'You are a great man sir!  'Wasting the scammers' time so they will not scam other people. You maybe just save 3-5 people from being scammed. May God bless you.' Another added: 'Diagnosed with plumber crack. DEAD!' The actor, who was previously a magician, explains on his Twitter bio: 'I make movies and mess with scammers for a living. Life is awesome. #blessed.' Last year he made a similar pranking video of an IRS caller who he kept on the phone for 40 minutes before shouting: 'Stop f***ing scamming people, you stupid dumb son of a b****'.   Share or comment on this article e-mail 116 shares Most watched News videos Phoney business: Hilarious man plays telephone scammers Moment cyclist gets shot by stray bullet during group ride Angry woman goes on racist tirade against couple fishing in her area Golfers watch on as huge alligator chows down on fish Miss District of Columbia crowned Miss USA 2017 Police in Baltimore discover toddler in car of man shot dead Heartwarming mother-daughter pit bull reunion at ASPCA Gronk celebrates his birthday with hot date at friend's wedding Moment owner breaks up fight between two young Rottweilers Bridesmaid seeks legal action after filmed 'attack' at wedding Gangster dog: Kid looks shocked as dog drives past him McMaster denies Trump revealed classified info to Russians Shocking moment cyclist is hit by stray bullet from...

Industry watchers say the price gap between the two sides has narrowed and the traditional stores’ loyalty programs are helping support sales. “Every point of market share is hard fought over in the grocery market,” said Kenric S. Tyghe, a consumer and retail analyst at Raymond James. “The traditional grocers have done a better job defending share than, I think, a lot of observers expected.” 00:48 Consumer Costco continues to muscle in on Canadian supermarkets 00:27 Consumer Facebook video questions Calgary Walmart’s treatment of customers 02:25 BC1 Costco grabbing bigger share of grocery market Story continues below While they have operated in Canada for years, competition from Costco and Walmart is still top of mind for local grocers given the low-cost strategy of the two foreign giants. In his most recent quarterly call with analysts in April, Metro CEO Eric R. La Fleche discussed Costco’s expansion in Ontario, saying it is “a significant competitor, and we have to execute and differentiate.” In the second quarter of 2004, traditional grocery stores sold about $12.3 billion worth of food, accounting for about 90 per cent of the market, according to Statistics Canada data. General merchandisers, which include Costco and Walmart, sold about $1.3 billion or roughly 9.8 per cent. READ MORE: Walmart Canada makes jump to being a ‘real grocer’ In the same quarter of 2016, traditional grocers’ market share fell to about 79.2 per cent, while that of the general merchandisers more than doubled. Those changes translate “into billions and billions of dollars every quarter,” said Kevin Grier, an agriculture and food market analyst, adding that the shift in market share to the U.S. chains is expected to slow. “You can’t keep that up,” he said. Canadian grocers were granted some respite from foreign-owned competitors when Target, which entered the Canadian market in 2013, pulled out of the country in 2015. Costco now operates 95 warehouses in Canada, while Walmart runs 410 stores. Costco plans to open three more stores by the end of this year for a total of seven new stores in 2017. Spokesman Ron Damiani said that’s the most sites the company’s opened in a financial year in recent memory. READ MORE: Canadian grocers’ move to cage-free eggs an ‘important commitment’ While Walmart has not revealed any new expansion plans, it announced in 2015 it would add 42 supercentre locations. Tyghe said that pace of expansion will not create the sort of disruption and dislocation seen when growth in square footage at the two chains outpaced population increases, forcing Canadian grocers to lower prices. The traditional grocers have also boosted their discount banner store counts, Tyghe said, keeping their hold on the most price-oriented customers. Loblaw, for example, operates 500 discount banner stores, including No Frills, across Canada. “We believe we have some of the strongest, most effectively operated and most customer-centric discount formats in the country,” Loblaw CEO Galen G. Weston said in an interview after the company’s annual meeting earlier this month. READ MORE: Okanagan grocer nationally recognized for helping new Canadians For the average Canadian shopper, that means the price difference between a product at a traditional grocer and a Costco or Walmart is not necessarily compelling enough to justify shopping at two separate locations, Tyghe said. “You’re not going to win on price alone,” he said. Another factor favouring traditional grocers is their strong loyalty programs, which give them robust customer data and the ability to target promotional offers to individuals based on their shopping habits, Tyghe said. “How they respond is increasingly in a very data-driven, targeted, promotional way,” he said. – With files from Linda Nguyen Report an error Canadian grocers Costco Discount discount banners Loblaws Loyalty programs metro No Frills supermarket traditional grocers Walmart Editor's Picks 25th amendment There's a process to remove incapable presidents, but it probably won't be used on Trump — yet Fake News Beware reports based on screenshotted tweets — here's why (again) Canada Moody's downgrades Canadian banks: Beginning of the end for the housing market?

Jacqueline Cote of New Bedford was in court Monday to see Judge William G. Young approve the settlement, 14 months after Cote's wife, Diana “Dee” Smithson, died of ovarian cancer. The action is expected to finalize the settlement reached late last year. Smithson was diagnosed in 2012, and the couple began incurring significant medical bills. Cote sued in 2015, saying Walmart repeatedly denied her wife coverage in violation of the Civil Rights Act. The Arkansas-based company began offering benefits for same-sex spouses in 2014. Massachusetts had legalized same-sex marriage a decade earlier, in 2004. Monday's hearing was brief, lasting perhaps two or three minutes. Young said the settlement was "in all respects fair and reasonable." "This was a carefully crafted and sensitive resolution of a complex matter," he said during the hearing. Cote and others who can document out-of-pocket health-care costs of $60,000 or more will receive payouts of three times their expenses. A source close to the case said Cote's expenses totaled about $152,000, meaning she will receive about $456,000, plus court costs. Those who can document lesser expenses will receive payouts of 1.5 times their costs. In addition, Walmart "commits to treating same-sex and opposite-sex spouses or couples equally in the provision of health insurance benefits, so long as to do so in consistent with applicable law," according to the settlement agreement. A spokeswoman for GLAD said Cote and her attorneys had expected to receive permission from Walmart to speak to the press, but had not received it by the time of the hearing. Cote declined an interview for the same reason. In 2015, she told The Standard-Times that one of the many hard things about not being able to provide health care for her wife was attending Walmart's workplace diversity trainings every year.  “I absolutely wanted to scream,” she said. “The thing I wanted to scream was: ‘Show me the diversity.’” She said she never felt discrimination at the store level where she worked in Swansea. She was represented in court by lawyers from GLBTQ Legal Advocates and Defenders, or GLAD, and the firm Outten & Golden, which specializes in employment law. She was also represented in the case by the Washington Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs, and Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer. After the hearing, GLAD issued a news release with a quote from Cote: “I’m pleased that Walmart was willing to resolve this issue for me and other associates who are married to someone of the same sex. It’s a relief to bring this chapter of my life to a close.” GLAD called the agreement "an important settlement for LGBTQ workers," and Walmart said the company was "happy both sides could come together to reach a resolution," according to the press release. The settlement class is expected to include up to a few thousand current and former Walmart employees. Follow Jennette Barnes on Twitter @jbarnesnews.

Share Tweet Share Email Comments CHIPPEWA FALLS — The Lake Hallie Police Department and Lake Hallie Village Board have requested that a lawsuit filed after an officer fatally shot a 25-year-old woman at a Walmart in April 2016 be dismissed.  Other entities being sued by the woman’s family are saying they intend to file similar motions. Melissa Abbott was a resident at the Northern Wisconsin Center, a state-operated facility for persons with disabilities and mental diseases. On April 8, 2016, Abbott was at the Walmart in Lake Hallie, 2786 Commercial Boulevard, when she began swinging a hatchet around other shoppers in the store. The Chippewa County dispatch center received a call at 5:11 p.m. about a “disorderly female who refused to leave the store.” Lake Hallie police Officer Adam Meyers arrived at the scene. Meyers shot twice, striking Abbott in the leg and abdomen. Abbott was taken to a nearby hospital, where she died. In May 2016, then-District Attorney Steve Gibbs issued a 12-page ruling, saying that Meyers “acted in self-defense and that his belief that he reasonably believed his life was in danger, or that he was likely to suffer great bodily harm, when Ms. Abbott refused to follow orders and charged officer Meyers with a hatchet.” However, the woman’s family filed the lawsuit earlier this year against the village, the store, the Police Department, the Northern Wisconsin Center and several insurance companies. Matteo Reginato, an attorney representing the village and the Police Department, filed a response earlier this month, requesting the lawsuit be dismissed. Reginato wrote that Meyers “acted consistent with his authority and within the scope of his employment at all times relevant to this lawsuit.” A telephone scheduling conference was Monday in Chippewa County Court before Judge James Isaacson. During that discussion, Wal-Mart’s attorney Angela Brandt informed Isaacson that her office also planned to file a motion to dismiss. “There aren’t any actual, factual allegations against Wal-Mart,” Brandt said. Other attorneys in the phone conference also expressed that they would be filing dismissal motions as well. Attorney Jeff Muszynski, who represents the Abbott family, told Isaacson that he is still working through mediation, and has not gotten to any exchange of discovery between the parties. Isaacson set another telephone scheduling conference for June 16, saying that should give Muszynski enough time to be prepared to move forward with court dates. The lawsuit, filed by River Falls attorney Dean Rohde, disagrees with Gibbs’ assessment of the incident. Rohde wrote that Meyers’ conduct and actions were “excessive and unreasonable, without lawful justification or reason, and was designed to and did cause specific and serious physical harm, pain and suffering and death.” He added that her death was caused by “the negligence of the village of Lake Hallie and or its agents and employees.” Rohde is requesting a jury award punitive damages to any and all defendants, that Lake Hallie, the Police Department, and the Northern Wisconsin Center “provide necessary training, personnel and resources to adequately protect the constitutional rights of citizens and patients of the Northern Wisconsin Center,” and that the defendants pay all attorney fees and other associated costs. Abbott was living at the Northern Wisconsin Center for the Developmentally Disabled on the east side of Chippewa Falls. The report includes interviews with workers at the facility, who had accompanied Abbott on the trip to Wal-Mart. Several other shoppers and Walmart employees also were interviewed. Gibbs report also included details about Abbott’s background in his report. “She has been diagnosed with depressive disorder, borderline personality disorder, and a mild intellectual disability,” Gibbs wrote. “She has been hospitalized in the past at Sacred Heart Hospital and Winnebago Mental Health Institute. Due to Melissa’s aggressive behaviors, multiple physical and mechanical restrains have been used to manage her challenging behaviors.” Abbott has threatened to kill the staff at the Excel Treatment Center, and wrote in her journal a desire that “when the cops get called I will grab their gun and there will be a shootout between me and the cops.” Meyers, who has been employed as a Lake Hallie police officer since Oct. 8, 2008, was placed on administrative leave after the shooting, which is standard protocol.

This may be the most important article you ever read Monday, May 15, 2017 by: Jayson Veley Tags: diabetes, insulin, prepping, survival (Natural News) Whether it’s the result of an EMP strike, a nuclear attack or some kind of zombie apocalypse, people across the country are vigorously preparing for life after society collapses like a house of cards. Many Americans have spent thousands of dollars on underground bunkers that they can retreat to should the outside world become too dangerous. Others have spent weeks planning out elaborate escape routes and rendezvous points so that they will have a place to meet up with family and friends should traditional transportation become impossible. But while this is all well and good, what is someone supposed to do if they have a condition that requires society to be intact in order to obtain the necessary treatment? According to the Centers for Disease Control, 29.1 million Americans had diagnosed or undiagnosed diabetes as of the year 2014, a number equal to 9.3 percent of the population. [RELATED: Read about the top five natural substances that could cure type 1 diabetes]. If someone who is living with diabetes is dependent on insulin, then the financial burden can be quite harsh, considering the fact that vials of insulin can cost $200 to $300 each. So, if the entire economy collapses along with society itself, how is a diabetic supposed to survive in a post-apocalyptic world? If you are a diabetic, the best way to handle being in a life or death situation such as the one described above is to not put yourself in that situation to begin with. A world without insulin as a diabetic would undoubtedly be extremely challenging, so the best thing anyone can do is prepare ahead of time and take precautionary measures. A few weeks ago, a contributor to The Survivalist Blog described a scenario in which he was talking to his doctor about the overwhelming cost of insulin. Much to his surprise, the doctor informed him that Walmart sells insulin over-the-counter without any questions asked for as little as $28. The doctor said that all he had to do was go to a Walmart pharmacy and ask for a vial of Novolin R insulin, a solution identical to the more expensive Humulin R, which costs roughly $150 per bottle. Better still, Walmart pharmacies that sell over-the-counter insulin allow consumers to purchase up to four vials at a time, providing diabetic preppers with an incredible opportunity to stock up in a relatively short amount of time. Many Walmart stores even sell other diabetic care products, such as syringes, meters and test strips, all of which are inexpensive and easy to purchase. The downside, however, is that not all states allow Walmart stores to sell insulin over-the-counter. People are encouraged to check online or visit their local Walmart shopping centers for more information. As with the purchase of any other medication, it is still important to know that what you are putting into your body is safe. Carmen Smith of Cleveland was another diabetic who eventually realized that she could purchase insulin from Walmart at a much lower cost and without a prescription. However, unlike the contributor for the Survivalist Blog, Smith didn’t have nearly as smooth an experience. Unsure of the correct dose, Smith used the amount a doctor had prescribed her years before. Describing what it was like when she didn’t get the dose of her insulin injections correct, she said, “It’s a quick high and then, it’s a down. The down part is, you feel icky. You feel lifeless. You feel pain. And the cramps are so intense — till you can’t walk, you can’t sit, you can’t stand.” She went on to say that because she was forced to guess how much insulin she should inject herself with, Smith had to visit the emergency room a number of times over the following years. Still, the fact that many Walmart stores sell non-prescription insulin is a little known fact that may very well help millions of diabetic preppers across the country.

Walmart settles $7.5 million in lawsuit for denying same-sex couples health benefits · PinkNews Enter your email address to receive our daily LGBT news roundup Sign up No thanks You're free to unsubscribe at any time. Follow @pinknews News News Home UK US World Trans Politics Education Law Religion Business Entertainment Trans Opinion Travel Life Life Home Health Sport About Advertise Contact Privacy RSS Search Home UK US World Current Affairs Entertainment Opinion Travel Features Trans US Walmart settles $7.5 million in lawsuit for denying same-sex couples health benefits Joseph Patrick McCormick, PinkNews 16th May 2017, 12:02 AM The money will be split in the class action lawsuit Walmart on Monday has had a $7.5 million settlement approved in a class action lawsuit alleging that same-sex couples were denied equal health benefits. The lawsuit was filed on behalf of a woman from New Bedford by GLAAD. It was based on the US Supreme Court ruling which extended marriage to same-sex couples across all 50 states, and an earlier ruling which extended spousal benefits to all couples. Jacqueline Cote had worked at Walmart for 15 years an initiated the lawsuit, but more than 300 other couples joined the suit making it class action. The plaintiffs will split $5.5 million between them, as attorneys’ fees will be deducted. US District Judge William G Young said the amount is fair for the lawsuit. “This was a carefully crafted and sensible resolution of a complex matter, and it reflects well on the parties from both sides,” Young said, speaking from the bench on Monday. Wal-Mart back in December agreed to pay out $7.5 million to settle the lawsuit. Employees complained that by failing to extend health insurance benefits to cover their partners, they were being discriminated against. Over a thousand current and former workers were affected by the policy which denied same-sex couples heath benefits between 2011 and 2013. The lawsuit was filed not long after same-sex marriage became legal across the US, in July 2015. Cote’s own wife had over $150,000 in bills fighting ovarian cancer, and so the lawsuit sought out reparations for before the policy was introduced. She said in a statement on Monday: “I’m pleased that Walmart was willing to resolve this issue for me and other associates who are married to someone of the same sex. It’s a relief to bring this chapter of my life to a close.” Sally Welborn, senior vice president for the company, said in a statement: “We’re happy both sides could come together to reach a resolution . . . We will continue to not distinguish between same and opposite sex spouses when it comes to the benefits we offer under our health insurance plan.” Walmart last year ditched a transphobic Halloween costume that was being sold via its online store. Ahead of Halloween the US supermarket giant was stocking a so-called ‘Tranny Granny’ costume via its online marketplace. 0 reader comments Share on Facebook Share on Twitter More like this Ellen surprised this hilarious teacher who pranked students with a RuPaul inspired spelling test Ellen DeGeneres just paid for an entire class of high school students to go to college (VIDEO) Walmart to pay out $7.5 million in lawsuit which denied gay couples equal health benefits Gerard Butler criticised for bizarre, ‘homophobic’ Halloween costume Walmart withdraws ‘appalling’ Tranny Granny Halloween costume More: supreme court same sex couples lawsuit GLAAD walmart health benefits class action Trending Trending Now Big Bang Theory's Jim Parsons marries Arrested Development star comes out Check out these adorable pics from Big Bang Theory Jim Parsons’ wedding Transgender woman killed, dismembered and cooked in a broth by her chef husband Trending The Big Bang Theory’s Jim Parsons marries his long-term boyfriend Arrested Development star comes out as bisexual Check out these adorable pics from Big Bang Theory Jim Parsons’ wedding This chef killed and dismembered his transgender wife before cooking her in a broth Latest stories Louisiana advances bill to protect same-sex couples in domestic abuse cases Abby Wambach and Glennon Doyle Melton just announced they are married Nevada bill to let trans people change names privately passes unanimously Trans man who overcame legal name change battle dies aged 25 Non-binary couple face vile Facebook abuse ahead of Good Morning Britain appearance LGBT group takes case against anti-Pride t-shirt printer to state Supreme Court © 2017 PinkNews Terms Contact Advertise

Two former Walmart employees last week filed a class action lawsuit in federal court, claiming the retail giant discriminated against them and thousands of pregnant workers by failing to provide on-the-job accommodations. The lawsuit alleges that while the $231 billion company makes on-the-job accommodations to many non-pregnant workers, Walmart fails to accommodate pregnant workers. Walmart’s policies and practices, according to the 25-page complaint, amount to “intentional discrimination.” Walmart employs nearly 1.2 million people in the United States, 784,000 of whom are women, according to the complaint and a 2015 company report. The suit was brought by two former Walmart workers who became pregnant while employed at Walmart stores in Illinois and Florida. Both workers filed discrimination complaints against Walmart with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and state agencies, according to the complaint.

DONATE NOW Otisha Woolbright, a former bakery and deli clerk in Florida, claims she was terminated because of her pregnancy and need for pregnancy-related accommodations, according to the complaint. Woolbright told her supervisor her doctor had said to avoid any heavy lifting. Woolbright claims her supervisor told her she had seen a pregnant Demi Moore do a somersault on television, and pregnancy was therefore “no excuse.” It wasn’t until Woolbright went to the hospital after lifting a 35-pound tray of rotisserie chickens that the company allowed her to do sedentary work, according to the complaint. She was later let go after asking about pregnancy leave. While working at an Illinois Walmart, Talisa Borders was refused pregnancy accommodations when she showed her employer a doctor’s note saying she could not lift more than 25 pounds or climb ladders, according to the complaint. Borders claims a Walmart human resources training coordinator, who reviewed her request for accommodations, forced Borders to take more than two months of unpaid leave, rather than accommodate her pregnancy. When Borders returned to work after having a baby, she was assigned a job that paid $8.85 per hour—$2 less than her previous job in Walmart’s Pharmacy Department, the complaint alleges. Walmart spokesman Randy Hargrove said the company’s policies have always fully met or exceeded state and federal law, and its anti-discrimination policy offers more protection than the law requires. “That policy has long listed pregnancy as a protected status,” Hargrove, senior director of national media relations, said in an email to Rewire. “We deny the claims of Ms. Borders and Ms. Woolbright and plan to defend the company.” Walmart revised its written policy in 2014 to offer accommodations for temporary disabilities caused by pregnancy. But it did so only after pregnant workers filed a complaint with the EEOC alleging the company’s policy amounted to pregnancy discrimination, as Rewire reported. Attorneys who brought the suit said Walmart’s policies and practices continue to force pregnant people to choose between a job and a pregnancy. “In 2017, it’s incredible that major companies like Walmart are discriminating against pregnant women—who are simply asking to keep on working and have a healthy pregnancy,” said Dina Bakst, co-president of A Better Balance, one of the groups that filed the complaint. “Pregnancy discrimination is a huge problem that disproportionately affects low-wage workers, like those at Walmart.” Walmart has prevailed in class-action decisions, showing it’s difficult to hold corporations accountable in these types of cases, as Rewire reported. The U.S. Supreme Court in Wal-Mart v. Dukes revoked the class-action certification of female Walmart workers, who alleged the retailer engaged in unlawful discrimination in pay and promotions. The Court found the women didn’t have enough to hold them in common in their claims against Walmart.

Updated: May 17, 2017 @ 1:35 am Full Forecast News Sports Obituaries Opinion Buy & Sell AP Chinese customers can now order from US Sam's Club stores By ANNE D'INNOCENZIO AP Retail Writer May 15, 2017 0 NEW YORK (AP) — Wal-Mart is letting online customers in China order from its Sam's Club stores in the U.S. for the first time to cater to China's increasingly affluent, well-traveled shoppers. It's Wal-Mart's latest attempt to boost growth in China since it sold its online business in the country to JD, China's No. 2 e-commerce site, in June 2016. The U.S. retailer has a 12 percent stake in JD and hopes working with the homegrown company will boost its performance in China. Getting China right is key to bolstering Wal-Mart's global online business. About 200 products from Sam's Clubs stores will initially be available for Sam's Club customers in China to order online via JD's website, expanding to 700 this year, says Rebecca Lui, a Wal-Mart spokeswoman. The company is focusing on personal care, baby supplies and nutritional supplies that are mostly not available in China. Products for sale include Aveeno moisturizers and Waterpik Ultra and Cordless Plus Water Flossers. Sam's Club has sold products on JD.com since October 2016, drawn from the stock in its 15 physical stores in China. Wal-Mart itself also operates more than 400 stores in China. The company is also tweaking its partnership with JD's delivery service, Daojia, to guarantee one-hour delivery, down from two hours, and expanding the number of stores where delivery is available. It expects to reach 180 stores this year. Get news headlines sent daily to your inbox Sign Up!

Newsy0:42 UP NEXT Video by CBS Minnesota For years, Target Corp. had bragging rights over Wal-Mart Stores Inc. in at least one area: cachet. Quotes in the article Wal-Mart Stores Inc WMT ▼ 75.11 -1.18 -1.55% Target Corp TGT ▼ 54.53 -0.82 -1.48% Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▲ 966.07 +8.10 +0.85% McDonald's Corp MCD ▲ 147.29 +1.01 +0.69% With its sleek products and trendy designers, the company had an edge over Wal-Mart’s bland supercenters, and developed a cult following among customers. That was then. The tumult in U.S. retail with the rise of digital commerce has upended the industry’s natural pecking order, and one casualty has been Target’s cool factor. By a host of measures -- sales, share price, even intellectual property -- Wal-Mart is besting Target with cleaner stores, lower prices and a refurbished online strategy. “This is not your father’s Wal-Mart anymore,” said Chuck Grom, an analyst at Gordon Haskett Research Advisors. As the two retailers prepare to report first-quarter results this week, here’s how they stack up. The rivals’ divergent paths are perhaps best illustrated by same-store sales, a key industry metric. While Wal-Mart’s so-called “comps” have accelerated in recent quarters, Target’s have fallen into negative territory. And they aren’t likely to improve anytime soon, as the company has forecast a low-single digit decline for the full year. Wal-Mart’s sales, in contrast, may rise even further if food deflation subsides, according to Grom, since it generates more than half of its sales from the grocery aisles, compared with more than 20 percent for Target. Another reason for Target’s struggles is that its shoppers just aren’t buying as much, thanks to the growing appeal of online merchants such as Amazon.com Inc., which has made an aggressive push into apparel, a key category for Target. Amazon was the most highly regarded womenswear retailer in the U.S. based on affordability and authenticity, according to a survey from British trend tracker WGSN, while Target was eighth. Load Error In the most recent holiday quarter, the value of the average basket of goods at Target declined. Amazon, meantime, surpassed all other brick-and-mortar retailers as the most-popular shopping destination, according to researcher Kantar Retail. To get shoppers spending more, Target plans to introduce a dozen new exclusive brands, hoping to mimic the success of kids’ clothing line Cat & Jack, whose sales now approach $1 billion. It’s also testing next-day delivery of household staples like detergent and paper towels. “Target has lower penetration than Wal-Mart, so they have to get more out of their shoppers,” said Leon Nicholas, an analyst at Kantar. Wal-Mart, meanwhile, is rolling out curbside pickup of online grocery orders to 500 additional U.S. stores this year, eyeing busy suburban moms who don’t want to schlep around a cavernous big-box store. On a recent weekday morning at a Wal-Mart in Rogers, Arkansas, employees began walking the aisles to prepare online orders at 4 a.m. Outside the store, about 10 parking spaces were dedicated for curbside pickup. The company studied fast-food purveyors like McDonald’s Corp. to figure out the best layout for the pickup area. “For Wal-Mart, winning online grocery is mission critical,” said Robin Sherk, an analyst at Kantar. “There’s a lot of work to do there, but online grocery is probably working the best for them.” Target, following the 2013 data breach that exposed personal information of tens of millions of customers, ramped up promotional deals to lure shoppers back in the door. But such deals lead to price tags that swing up and down, confusing shoppers. Wal-Mart has invested billions to reduce its already low everyday prices to battle the encroachment of German hard-discount chains Aldi and Lidl, with a goal of being 15 percent cheaper than the competition on 80 percent of what it sells, according to an internal document obtained by Bloomberg. The result is a widening price gap between Wal-Mart and Target. Wal-Mart is also winning the intellectual property race. During the past five years, it has taken the lead over Target in patent applications, many focused on web development and easing shoppers’ journey through the store. The company has even filed a patent for in-store drones that would ferry products from the backroom to the sales floor. Target’s patents tend to deal with products, display units and shelving, according to researcher CB Insights. Over the past year, the company has jettisoned several long-term innovation projects to focus on its core business, and parted ways with its chief innovation and strategy officer and its chief digital officer.

The first locations are set to open their doors in the next few weeks. As a result, Walmart is asking suppliers to keep their prices low, according to the Consumerist.    According to the report, vendors have been told that Walmart should be paying 15% less than competitors at least 80% of the time. Additionally, the retail giant is asking suppliers to ship Walmart’s orders complete and on time, which would help keep items in stock, avoid unneeded re-orders, and take in an additional $1 billion in sales — a move that would benefit suppliers, as well.   Lidl is not a new competitor for Walmart. The retail giant’s Asda stores compete directly against Lidl and Aldi in Europe. As Lidl prepares its U.S. debut, however, Walmart is eager stay one step ahead — especially since its European Asda brand has failed to grow sales for 13 consecutive quarters, while Lidl, along with Aldi, have captured 12% of the market, the report said.   To read more, click here.   Login or Register to post a comment. ﻿ Newsletter Sign Up Get the latest news sent to your inbox   Popular Most Commented Study ranks America’s favorite grocery stores Specialty apparel retailer exiting Canada Coach snags rival in $2.4 billion acquisition Jet.com ventures into physical retail Report: Children’s clothing retailer to reorganize President-elect hurting traffic at some major retail flagships Dollar Tree comes out on top Restaurant giant in $1.8 billion acquisition German grocery giant to make a big U.S. debut ahead of schedule Study: Retailers leave money on table due to lack of personalized service Solutions Spotlight Taking Stock of Retail’s Analytics Capabilities When it comes to using data and analytics to drive business results, where does the retail industry stand relative to other industries?

Police said West Hartford resident Scott Backer had been talking to who he thought was a 15-year-old girl on the phone app Yik Yak earlier this year. Backer had asked the "teen" to meet him at the Walmart in Cromwell. However, the teen was, in fact, an adult male posing as a teenage girl online. The man confronted Backer at Walmart on Jan. 12, where he videotaped their encounter. Police arrested Backer on Monday and charged with use of a computer to entice a minor to engage in sexual activity. He is being held on a $150,000 bond. Backer was fired from Wesleyan University last year after an investigation uncovered allegations of other sexual misconduct at his previous job at Vermont Academy, which is a college preparatory school. Backer's is the second arrest that can be directly attributed to the prey on predators website. A video of Baker was posted to Popsquadcc.com. Backer was arrested three months after his video was posted on the site. "It's a big relief, I feel like change is beginning to be made," POP Squad Founder Incognito said. Incognito said he wants his identity protected, so he can keep shining the light on local predators. For the past four months, Incognito has used his site to catch 40 suspects and had made a catch as recent as 2:30 a.m. on Tuesday. "People I didn't catch live, just on the chat logs, whether they were out of state, out of the country, well over 120," Incognito said. However, police said what Incognito is doing is dangerous and wish he'd leave it up to the trained professionals. "You never know how they're going to react," West Hartford Police Sgt. Tony Anderle said. "Are they going to run away? Are they going to attack you?" Even though some would think pop squad is gift-wrapping cases for police, detectives told Eyewitness News it's not always that cut and dry. "That turns into problems when if you're going to turn that over to police with judicial problems," Anderle said. "There's reasons there's police officers in your neighborhood." Incognito told Eyewitness News he has no plans to stop and his goal is to ultimately make penalties for local offenders as strong and severe as possible.

The proposed class action lawsuit was filed in federal court in Illinois on Friday by Talisa Borders and Otisha Woolbright, who say that until 2014, Arkansas-based Wal-Mart had a companywide policy that denied pregnant women the same accommodations as workers with other disabilities. The class could include at least 20,000 women and possibly up to 50,000 who worked at Wal-Mart while pregnant before the policy change, according to the lawsuit. The company in a statement provided by spokesman Randy Hargrove denied the women’s claims and said Wal-Mart’s pregnancy policies “have always fully met or exceeded both state and federal law.” The company said a separate anti-discrimination policy it maintains has long listed pregnancy as a protected status. “Walmart is a great place for women to work,” the company said. Borders and Woolbright say that Wal-Mart’s old policy violated a federal law requiring employers to treat pregnancy as a temporary disability and provide work accommodations to pregnant women. The U.S. Supreme Court, in a 2015 case involving United Parcel Service, said employers cannot treat pregnant workers differently from those with other disabilities or medical conditions. Wal-Mart, the largest private U.S. employer, changed its policy in 2014 to treat pregnancy as a disability. But lawyers for the plaintiffs in the lawsuit say the changes did not go far enough, and they were planning a separate lawsuit involving the new policy. Woolbright says her manager at a Florida Wal-Mart told her pregnancy was “no excuse” for not doing heavy lifting. She says she was fired from her job in the deli department after injuring herself lifting trays that weighed up to 50 pounds and inquiring further about the company’s pregnancy policies. Borders, who worked at an Illinois Wal-Mart, says she was reprimanded for asking coworkers to climb ladders and lift heavy boxes while she was pregnant, and forced to go on unpaid leave. When she returned, she says, she was paid $2.00 less per hour. The case is Borders v. Wal-Mart Stores Inc, U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois, No. 3:17-cv-00506.

The suspects were arrested a short time later down the street from the store, according to a police report. A caller reported the robbery just after 2 a.m. Saturday and reported that one of the suspects ran toward Belmont Avenue while another drove that way in a car. The televisions were left behind in the process. Police spotted a car matching the description of the suspect’s vehicle at the Shell gas station on Belmont Avenue. A man in the car, 35-year-old Craig Honkonen, was arrested. Police said he was covered in sweat and had clothing matching the description of the suspect’s in the vehicle. The other suspect, 47-year-old Aaron Jones, was spotted in the parking lot of Denny’s. Police said he had a pair of metal pliers in his pocket. Walmart employees confirmed that Honkonen and Jones were the men who tried to rob the store. They told police that they cut security devices from the televisions with the pliers and then tried to leave the store with the TVs. When stopped, they struggled with employees, and Honkonen hit an employee with the buggy, according to a police report. Police said during the investigation, it was found that Jones was asking people at Denny’s for money after the robbery. He told them that his car was broken down at the Shell gas station and he needed to get home to Columbus, according to a police report. Jones told police that Honkonen had come to Walmart to “do his thing” and said he was only there to get food, according to the report. Honkonen initially told police that Jones had threatened him with a gun and said he would kill him and his mother if he didn’t steal the televisions. When asked why he didn’t ask for help in the store, he told officers that he was scared but later admitted to being involved in the robbery, the report said. Honkonen is charged with robbery and complicity while Jones is charged with complicity, criminal damaging and possession of criminal tools. They are being held in Trumbull County Jail. .

La Monica   @lamonicabuzz May 16, 2017: 10:55 AM ET Is the mall dead? It looks like most builders aren't buying plywood, concrete, bricks and other construction supplies from Amazon. Or even Walmart. They are doing so at Home Depot -- and that's why it is a bright spot in an otherwise gloomy time for traditional retailers. Home Depot reported earnings and revenues that topped Wall Street's forecasts Tuesday. The company also raised its profit outlook for the year. And it reported a same-store sales increase (stores open at least a year) of 5.5% overall and 6% in the US. Home Depot (HD) stock rose 2% in early trading to a new all-time high. The stock is now up nearly 20% this year, making it one of the top performers in the Dow this year -- along with Apple (AAPL, Tech30), McDonald's (MCD) and Visa (V). Home Depot is benefiting from a strong housing market. So is its rival Lowe's (LOW), which will report its latest results on May 24. Shares of Lowe's are up 20% this year as well. During a conference call with analysts Tuesday, Home Depot chief financial officer Carol Tomé said that the housing market continues to grow despite mixed forecasts for the overall economy. Housing prices have been steadily on the rise, which motivates prospective sellers to do home improvement projects to maximize the sale price for their house. Related: Retail train wreck continues as many big chains post declining sales Home Depot isn't ignoring the digital opportunities that have helped Amazon and Walmart either. Quite the contrary. Home Depot CEO Craig Menear said during the conference call that online sales rose 23% in the most recent quarter. But it clearly helps that both Home Depot and Lowe's are specialty stores that sell things that many people still want to buy at physical locations, especially professional builders and contractors. Menear added during the call that sales to its "Pro" customer segment continue to outpace that of average DIY customers looking to fix a broken closet door or leaky faucet. Still, Home Depot remains one of the exceptions in an otherwise dismal environment for many retailers. Related: Rue21 is the latest retailer to file for Chapter 11 Teen apparel retailer Rue21 announced Tuesday it was filing for bankruptcy protection, joining a long and growing list of retailers that have been forced to go the Chapter 11 route, such as Aeropostale, Wet Seal, Pacific Sunwear and The Sports Authority. Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF), once one of the hottest apparel chains for young adults, is looking to sell itself to a buyer as its sales continue to fall. Department stores Macy's (M), Sears (SHLD), JCPenney (JCP), Kohl's (KSS) and Nordstrom (JWN) have been struggling to compete with Amazon and Walmart as well. And two other retailers reported weak sales and gave sluggish outlooks on Tuesday -- T.J. Maxx and Marshalls owner TJX (TJX) and Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS). Shares of TJX fell 4% on the news while Dick's stock plunged 12%. That makes the gains for Home Depot on Tuesday all the more impressive. The company's signature color is orange. But perhaps Home should change that to green instead. It's one of the few traditional retailers not in the red lately, after all.

(NASDAQ:AMZN). Most other bricks-and-mortar stores are dying on the vine scrambling for market share. Source: Shutterstock Technically, WMT stock comes into earnings this week equidistant from its two-year highs and lows. I am a believer that markets overshoot on the way up and down. In Walmart’s case, this was clear to see on the chart — the price is in perfect balance relative to the extremes. Click to Enlarge Since the fundamental story for WMT stock is still as solid as ever, I am willing to take a risk on the long side even going into the uncertainty of earnings. I am a conservative trader, so I won’t risk $76 per share to buy WMT stock outright and with no room for error. Instead, I will use options to generate income from selling risk against support. The idea is not new, as I’ve demonstrated how easy it was back in March when I shared a trade that delivered profits with zero out-of-pocket expense. To me, Walmart’s strength is in its simple goal to be the low-price leader. I don’t hear as much about new efforts to improve its image, so management is focused on better execution of the plan at hand. The Trade: Sell WMT Dec $60 put and collect 50 cents per contract. With a 20% price buffer this trade has a 90% theoretical chance of maximum gains. If price falls below $59.50, I would accrue losses from having to own the stock. It is important to note that I am not chasing a price target since I just need WMT stock stay above my sold put to win. I am collecting a premium for the opportunity to own WMT stock at a 20% discount from the current price. In essence, I am selling someone a bearish WMT lotto ticket that will be a loser for them by design. Selling naked puts is not suited for all traders so to reduce the size of the risk I can change this setup to be a credit put spread instead, and it wouldn’t require a lot of compromise. The Alternate: Sell the WMT Dec $65/$60 credit put spread which has a slightly smaller price buffer but still could yield 8% on risk. Compare that with buying Walmart stock at $76 and needing it to rally 8% more to match the performance of the spread. Learn how to generate income from options here.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the world’s biggest retailer with $486 billion in yearly sales, not only has a massive rivalry with e-commerce giant Amazon.com Inc. but also faces growing competition from German store chains building up their U.S. businesses. “Lidl, a German discount chain whose entrance in the U.K. in 1994 has helped upend that country’s grocery sector, says it will open 20 stores in Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina by summer, with some arriving in the next few weeks,” The Wall Street Journal reported. “Two hundred or more are planned in the coming years, according to real-estate analysts.” Aldi, a German discounter that opened its first U.S. store 40 years ago, plans to spend $1.6 billion to remodel and expand 1,300 locations and build 650 more by next year. Lidl and Aldi have about 10,000 European stores and $100 billion in yearly sales, the WSJ said. “Lidl’s arrival and Aldi’s growth come at an already fraught time for the U.S. grocery industry,” the newspaper reported. “Food-price deflation has eaten into grocers’ earnings for the past 17 months as of April, the longest stretch of year-over-year declines in retail food prices since 1956.” Doug McMillon, chief executive officer of Wal-Mart since 2014, told the WSJ that the company is working on product selection, price cuts and speeding up checkout lines. Grocery chains also are preparing for the German assault. “Kroger Co., the biggest U.S. supermarket chain by stores and revenue, in March reported its first quarterly decline in same-store sales in 13 years, while Publix Super Markets Inc. said this month its sales fell for the first time since the recession,” the WSJ said. Kroger Chief Financial Officer Michael Schlotman said the company, which oversees the Harris Teeter brand of stores near Lidl’s planned stores, is looking to cut prices and ensure its private-label brands can compete with discounters. The German stores may not have a big effect on the U.S. market, where chains have been locked in competitive struggles for years. Aldi has been here since 1976 and still only has 1 percent market share, according to investment manager Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. “We’ve seen attempts to beat Aldi prices before, and we’ve always been able to go lower,” Jason Hart, CEO of Aldi U.S., told the WSJ. It took Amazon 18 years as a public company to catch Wal-Mart in market value, but it took less than another two years for Amazon to be worth twice as much. On the 20th anniversary of its IPO, Amazon’s market capitalization stands at $459 billion while retail rival Walmart’s is at about $228 billion, Recode reported. Meanwhile, AFP reports that Wal-Mart, the 800-pound gorilla of retail, is running hard to catch up in an increasingly crucial segment where it is neither the biggest nor the best: e-commerce. The company, founded in 1962 by Sam Walton, has been gobbling up smaller and niche players in e-commerce in an effort to reach online shopping market leader Amazon.

The surveillance footage, released by the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office on Wednesday, shows Michael Foster, 43, tackling Clarence Daniels from behind as he was walking into a Brandon, Fla. Wal-Mart on Tuesday. Foster followed Daniels into the store after seeing him exiting his vehicle with a gun holstered under his shirt — which was perfectly legal for the 62-year-old Daniels to do since he holds a concealed weapon license. Nevertheless, Foster tackled Daniels from behind as he entered the store, and put him in a chokehold before taking him to the ground. Witnesses said that Foster yelled out that Daniels had a gun. They also said that Daniels yelled out that he had a license for it. Foster called 911 only after he tackled accosted Daniels. He was arrested and charged with battery.

(GuruFocus) A majority of the companies in the S&P 500 (SPX) have reported earnings, 450 out of 500 as of last Friday according to CNBC, but there are still plenty of big names left to report, especially in the retail sector. Many analysts are painting a bleak picture for the sector following recent results from retailers Macy’s Inc. (NYSE: M), Nordstrom, Inc. (NYSE: JWN), Kohl’s Corporation (NYSE: KSS) and J C Penney Company Inc (NYSE: JCP). Despite some of the big names missing expectations, April retail sales were up 4.5% compared to a year ago, which some are taking as a sign that high consumer confidence is starting to translate into spending. While it seems like there’s mixed results between economic data and earnings, a big question on many investor’s minds is how brick-and-mortar retailers are positioning themselves for the future as ecommerce sales continue to grow. That same question might be top of mind when Target Corporation (NYSE: TGT) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE: WMT) report before market open on May 18 and May 19, respectively. Target Earnings and Options Activity When Target reports first-quarter results, it’s expected to earn $0.89 per share, down from $1.29 in Q1 2016, on revenue of $15.64 billion, according to consensus third-party analyst estimates. Based on analyst estimates, earnings are expected to drop much more than revenue, which is forecasted to decline just under 3.5% from last year compared to a double-digit drop in earnings. So far this year, the stock is down almost 24% compared to just over a 5% decline in the S&P 500 Retail Index. According to the Wall Street Journal, Target has focused on investing in internal initiatives instead of spending that money on potential acquisitions. At the end of February, the company announced it would spend $7 billion in capital over the next three years to “to grow sales faster, gain market share, adapt to guests’ rapidly changing preferences and give them even more reasons to choose Target.” Looking at options activity around earnings, the market has priced in about a 4.7% potential move in either direction for its stock, according to the Market Maker Move indicator on the thinkorswim platform. In short-term options trading leading up to earnings at the May 19 monthly expiration, calls had higher volume at the 56 and 57 strike prices while volume for puts was higher at the 53 and 55 strikes. As of Tuesday morning, the implied volatility sits at the 100th percentile, as high as it gets.    Note: Call options represent the right, but not the obligation, to buy the underlying security at a predetermined price over a set period of time. Put options represent the right, but not the obligation, to sell the underlying security at a predetermined price over a set period of time.  Wal-Mart Earnings and Options Activity Wal-Mart is expected to report earnings of $0.96 per share, close to the $0.98 earnings per share in Q1 2016, on revenue of $117.65 billion, according to consensus third-party analyst estimates. While earnings are roughly flat to last year, analysts are expecting revenues to increase 1.5% from $115.9 billion a year ago.  The stock is up just over 11% year to date, outperforming the broader retail sector and some of its peers. Last year the company acquired online retailer Jet.com for $3 billion and so far this year has announced several acquisitions including: shoe seller ShoeBuy, outdoor outfitter Moosejaw, and ModCloth. These recently announced acquisitions as well as last year’s Jet.com are all online retailers. On last quarter’s earnings call, Wal-Mart CFO Brett Briggs said “Looking ahead, you’ll continue to see us make investments in e-commerce to drive traffic and improve the customer value proposition”. It also recently tested a subscription service similar to Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) Prime. However, it later announced it would scrap its subscription service in favor of a lower minimum order for free shipping as well as offering discounts for picking up online orders in store. On the options side, traders have priced in just under a 3% potential stock move in either direction, according to the Market Maker Move indicator on the thinkorswim platform. In short-term options trading leading up to earnings at the May 19 monthly expiration, calls were active at the 77 and 77.5 strike prices while puts were active at the 74 and 75 strikes. As of Tuesday morning, the implied volatility sits at the 38th percentile.     Earnings season isn’t over yet: Alibaba Group Holdings Ltd (NYSE: BABA) reports before market open on Thursday and Deere & Company (NYSE: DE) reports before market open on Friday.

We’ve known the MediaPad line since 2012 and up to this day, the Chinese OEM is still working on new models. The latest is the MediaPad T3 announced last month and will soon be available in the United States on Walmart stores and online. The 7-inch T3 is priced at only $89 so we know it will be another bestseller as it is also attractive with its ultra-slim style, vibrant 7-inch screen, lightweight build, and a small bezel design. The Huawei T3 7 is said to be the first tablet from the brand to be up for purchase in Walmart stores. This is one strategy of Huawei to infiltrate the American market, hoping to be the choice for affordable Android tablets you can easily give away as gifts to family and friends. The Huawei MediaPad T3 7 sports the following features: 7-inch IPS display, 1024 x 600 pixel resolution, 1.3GHz quad-core MediaTek MT8127 processor, 1GB RAM, 0.24-inch bezel, 2MP selfie camera, 2MP rear cam, 16GB built-in storage, microSD card slot, virtual wide speaker, and a 3100mAh battery. The standard connectivity options are also there: USB OTG, GPS, and WiFi. Huawei MediaPad T3 7 tablet only runs Android 6.0 Marshmallow. Device will be available in either Moonlight Silver or Space Gray.

Or even Walmart. They are doing so at Home Depot — and that’s why it is a bright spot in an otherwise gloomy time for traditional retailers. Home Depot reported earnings and revenues that topped Wall Street’s forecasts Tuesday. The company also raised its profit outlook for the year. And it reported a same-store sales increase (stores open at least a year) of 5.5% overall and 6% in the US. Home Depot stock rose 2% in early trading to a new all-time high. The stock is now up nearly 20% this year, making it one of the top performers in the Dow this year — along with Apple, McDonald’s and Visa. Home Depot is benefiting from a strong housing market. So is its rival Lowe’s, which will report its latest results on May 24. Shares of Lowe’s are up 20% this year as well. During a conference call with analysts Tuesday, Home Depot chief financial officer Carol Tomé said that the housing market continues to grow despite mixed forecasts for the overall economy. Housing prices have been steadily on the rise, which motivates prospective sellers to do home improvement projects to maximize the sale price for their house. Home Depot isn’t ignoring the digital opportunities that have helped Amazon and Walmart either. Quite the contrary. Home Depot CEO Craig Menear said during the conference call that online sales rose 23% in the most recent quarter. But it clearly helps that both Home Depot and Lowe’s are specialty stores that sell things that many people still want to buy at physical locations, especially professional builders and contractors. Menear added during the call that sales to its “Pro” customer segment continue to outpace that of average DIY customers looking to fix a broken closet door or leaky faucet. Still, Home Depot remains one of the exceptions in an otherwise dismal environment for many retailers. Teen apparel retailer Rue21 announced Tuesday it was filing for bankruptcy protection, joining a long and growing list of retailers that have been forced to go the Chapter 11 route, such as Aeropostale, Wet Seal, Pacific Sunwear and The Sports Authority. Abercrombie & Fitch, once one of the hottest apparel chains for young adults, is looking to sell itself to a buyer as its sales continue to fall. Department stores Macy’s, Sears, JCPenney, Kohl’s and Nordstrom have been struggling to compete with Amazon and Walmart as well. And two other retailers reported weak sales and gave sluggish outlooks on Tuesday — T.J. Maxx and Marshalls owner TJX and Dick’s Sporting Goods. Shares of TJX fell 4% on the news while Dick’s stock plunged 12%. That makes the gains for Home Depot on Tuesday all the more impressive. The company’s signature color is orange. But perhaps Home should change that to green instead. It’s one of the few traditional retailers not in the red lately, after all.

The former "30 Rock" star returns to the stage in a new Netflix comedy special, "Tracy Morgan: Staying Alive" -- Morgan's first since a limo he was traveling in was hit by a Walmart truck in June 2014. The crash left Morgan in a coma with a traumatic brain injury and killed his best friend, James McNair. Nearly three years later, Morgan is telling jokes in the standup special about his hard-won recovery. "I've always used my sense of humor as a healing process for me," Morgan told CNN.

"I'm doing standup for Netflix, I'm living my life, I'm getting to see my kids grow. There's people out there with nothing to eat, no water." Morgan credits his current health to his supporters and his family. "I had to fight because they need me. I had to fight. My baby was only 10 months old, she's my only daughter.

The surveillance footage, released by the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office on Wednesday, shows Michael Foster, 43, tackling Clarence Daniels from behind as he was walking into a Brandon, Fla. Wal-Mart on Tuesday. Foster followed Daniels into the store after seeing him exiting his vehicle with a gun holstered under his shirt — which was perfectly legal for the 62-year-old Daniels to do since he holds a concealed weapon license. Nevertheless, Foster tackled Daniels from behind as he entered the store, and put him in a chokehold before taking him to the ground. Witnesses said that Foster yelled out that Daniels had a gun. They also said that Daniels yelled out that he had a license for it. Foster called 911 only after he tackled accosted Daniels. He was arrested and charged with battery.

Tech Apple Science Cars Samsung Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 Nintendo NES E3     NES Classic Stock Finally Depleated Posted: May 16 2017, 8:04am CDT | by Luigi Lugmayr, in News | Technology News     The Nintendo NES Classic Edition is out of stock t the regular price for good. Over the weekend the trickling of Nintendo NES Classic stock into a few stores has practically ended. The discontinued NES Classic Edition was still surfacing at retailers in May. Officially the NES Classic Edition is history, according to a Nintendo statement, but retailers are still getting new inventory.  Don't Miss: The hottest Apple Rumors for 2017 We have seen Walmart stores and Target stores and even a few GameStop stores receiving new NES Classic shipments in the first days of May. Best Buy store was also restocking the NES Classic out of nowhere about a week ago. The last NES Classic spotted in stock is now two days ago. According to iStockNow, the Walmart Catonsville, MD was the last store in the United States that had a NES Classic in stock. A ghost NES Classic appeared today in a GameStop store in Germany. That is the last entry.  Now the only way to buy a NES Classic console is from a reseller on eBay or Amazon. Reseller prices for the NES Classic have dropped despite the end of the NES. The lowest priced Nintendo NES Classic console sells for $238 plus shipping on amazon.com.  The reseller prices have been over $300 early April, right after the announcement that Nintendo stops making the NES Classic. Find all NES Classic offers and auctions on ebay.com as well as all marketplace offers on amazon.com. NES Classic Edition offers on ebay.com can be found at around $200. Modded NES Classic for over $300. eBay has 2,170 NES Classic offers listed.  The $59.99 Nintendo NES Classic Edition console launched on November 11 in stores and online. The supply was extremely constraint in stores and especially online. On April 13, Nintendo announced to stop production of the NES Classic Edition. Nintendo said that the last shipments of the NES Classic arrive through April. We keep spotting though the $59.99 NES Classic Edition in May. The palm-sized NES console, retailing for $59.99 list price, features the classic Nintendo NES controller many geeks have grown up with. The retro console comes pre-installed with 30 classic NES games including Super Mario Bros., Pac-Man, Metroid, Donkey Kong, The Legend of Zelda and Kirby's Adventures. The NES Classic Edition system is a miniaturized version of the groundbreaking NES, originally released in 1985. The ability to mod the NES Classic and install an unlimited number of games has renewed the hype around the retro console. The latest hack enables the NES Classic to store 2,500 games. The 80s retro console launched on November 11, 2016. As of Aprl 27, 2017, Nintendo has sold 2.3 million NES Classic Edition.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 16 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Road Fleets Demand More Sustainable, Low-Carbon Fuels for Freight SOURCE: BSR DESCRIPTION: Sustainable Fuel Buyers’ Principles to Help Companies Drive Economic Growth and Emissions Reductions  Santa Monica, Calif., May 16, 2017 /3BL Media/ – Companies including several of the world’s largest road fleets and freight buyers have signed onto BSR’s new Sustainable Fuel Buyers’ Principles, committing to accelerating the transition to sustainable, low-carbon fuel and related technologies. Launched at the Advanced Clean Transportation (ACT) Expo 2017, the seven principles will demonstrate demand and catalyze the partnerships needed to drive a sustainable transition in the freight fuel system by focusing on three areas: building the market for low-carbon fuels, managing sustainable progress, and developing partnerships and collaborations for systemic solutions. Buyers and shippers who support the principles seek business partners who can help to: Support low-carbon, sustainable fuel choices Demonstrate competitiveness Advance investment, pilots, and standardization Measurably improve well-to-wheels climate impacts Address other relevant sustainability impacts and benefits Invest in R&D breakthroughs Collaborate for systemic solutions “We see the Sustainable Fuel Buyers’ Principles as a great way to build demand with other leading buyers seeking low-carbon fuels and to promote the partnerships with our own suppliers that will ensure UPS’s success,” says Mike Whitlatch, Vice President for Global Energy and Procurement at UPS, a signatory of the principles. „UPS understands the importance of using alternative fuels and has invested more than $750 million in alternative fuel and advanced technology vehicles and fueling stations globally since 2009.” Elizabeth Fretheim, Senior Director for Logistics Sustainability at Walmart, also a signatory, says: “As the first retailer with a verified science-based targets emissions reduction plan, Walmart understands the importance of incorporating the utility of more sustainable, low carbon fuels in our fleet operations. The Sustainable Fuel Buyers’ Principles is a noteworthy initiative that sends a demand signal for cleaner fuel innovations and provides a forum for like-minded companies to collaborate on our sustainability goals.” Rod DeGesero, Director of Global Logistics Procurement & Partner Management at HP Inc., another signatory, comments: “HP is pleased to be the first consumer electronic products company to sign onto the Sustainable Fuel Buyers’ Principles in support of our efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions across HP’s global supply chain. BSR’s green freight initiatives like Clean Cargo Working Group (CCWG) and Future of Fuels helps us collaborate with peers to demonstrate demand and partner with suppliers to make progress.” “As one of the largest commercial fleet operators in the U.S., PepsiCo has seen the benefits—both environmentally and economically—of taking a leadership role embracing fleet sustainability and fuel efficiency,” says Mike O’Connell, Senior Director Supply Chain, PepsiCo, another signatory. “We believe the Sustainable Fuel Buyers’ Principles will help spur innovation that can further reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase the adoption of fuel-saving technologies for road fleets nationwide.” Scott Hemphill, Global Sustainability Developer at IKEA Transport, also a signatory, says: “IKEA has been pioneering the use of alternative fuels in several countries in recent years and we are acutely aware of the challenges to implementing low-carbon fuels in many of our markets. We see the uptake of alternative fuels as an extremely important part of our decarbonisation strategy and welcome all efforts to improve the availability and economic feasibility of low-carbon fuels.” “Shifting the heavy-duty freight sector to low-carbon alternative fuel and vehicle technologies that deliver comparable performance, fuel efficiency, and environmental benefits is needed to achieve the emission reduction targets set by the Paris Agreement, “ says Karen Hamberg, Vice-President, Strategy at Westport, a Future of Fuels member. “Signatories to the Principles are providing a critical market signal to OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) and clean-technology solutions providers like Westport Fuel Systems that leading fleets see an investment in low-carbon fuels as the path forward and will drive the commercial availability of a wider range of alternative fuel and vehicle technologies suitable for a diverse heavy-duty freight sector.” The Sustainable Fuel Buyers’ Principles were developed by BSR’s Future of Fuels, a business-to-business fuel- neutral group focused on lifecycle energy sustainability. The mission of Future of Fuels is to drive a sustainable transition to low-carbon commercial road freight with new tools, convenings, and partnerships. The principles complement the Fuel Sustainability Tool (available free) developed last year as the world’s first apples-to-apples way to compare emissions reductions from investments in efficiency and the advanced fuel technologies entering the market. Fleet owners, OEM’s, fuel producers, and shippers can apply to join the membership of Future of Fuels. Nate Springer, BSR’s Manager of Future of Fuels commented: “The Sustainable Fuel Buyers’ Principles show growing buyer demand to spark new partnerships with suppliers for more low-carbon, sustainable fuels. Together with our Fuel Sustainability Tool, companies know what the market wants and how to make progress on more sustainable fuels.”  Tweet me: Road fleets demand more sustainable, low-carbon fuels for freight @BSRnews http://bit.ly/2rjF09t KEYWORDS: Responsible Business & Employee Engagement, BSR, future of fuels, Alternative Fuels, Sustainable Fuel Buyers’ Principles, UPS, Walmart, HP Inc., Pepsico, IKEA Transport, Westport, road freight, low-carbon fuels CategoriesUncategorized TagsUncategorized Post navigation Previous PostPrevious Nielsen To Add Nearly 15,000 Television Audience Meters As Part Of Diary Replacement Local Measurement Solution Next PostNext Global Hybrid Operating Rooms Market Research Report 2016 Search Recent Posts Rising of aged population adversely effects Asia-Pacific Anti-Aging Market.

More Comments Tumblr Pinterest Reddit Digg FarkIt StumbleUpon Two former Wal-Mart Stores Inc employees have filed a lawsuit accusing the retailer of treating thousands of pregnant workers as “second-class citizens” by rejecting their requests to limit heavy lifting, climbing on ladders and other potentially dangerous tasks. The proposed class action lawsuit was filed in federal court in Illinois on Friday by Talisa Borders and Otisha Woolbright, who say that until 2014, Arkansas-based Wal-Mart had a company-wide policy that denied pregnant women the same accommodations as workers with other disabilities. The class could include at least 20,000 women and possibly up to 50,000 who worked at Wal-Mart while pregnant before the policy change, according to the lawsuit. A Wal-Mart spokesman on Monday said the company had not seen the lawsuit and did not have any comment. Related The long, hard, unprecedented fall of Sears: One of the most monumental collapses in business history Amazon wants Cheerios, Oreos and other brands to make their products to be shipped, not sold at Wal -Mart Borders and Woolbright say that Wal-Mart’s old policy violated a federal law requiring employers to treat pregnancy as a temporary disability and provide work accommodations to pregnant women. The U.S. Supreme Court, in a 2015 case involving United Parcel Service, said employers cannot treat pregnant workers differently from those with other disabilities or medical conditions. Wal-Mart, the largest private U.S. employer, changed its policy in 2014 to treat pregnancy as a disability. But lawyers for the plaintiffs in the lawsuit say the changes did not go far enough, and they were planning a separate lawsuit involving the new policy. Woolbright says her manager at a Florida Wal-Mart told her pregnancy was “no excuse” for not doing heavy lifting. She says she was fired from her job in the deli department after injuring herself lifting trays that weighed up to 50 pounds and inquiring further about the company’s pregnancy policies. Borders, who worked at an Illinois Wal-Mart, says she was reprimanded for asking coworkers to climb ladders and lift heavy boxes while she was pregnant, and forced to go on unpaid leave. When she returned, she says, she was paid US$2.00 less per hour. The case is Borders v. Wal-Mart Stores Inc, U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois, No. 3:17-cv-00506. © Thomson Reuters 2017 Find Financial Post on Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Email Typo?

Comedian Tracy Morgan, critically injured in a 2014 road accident, returns to the stage in the Netflix special "Tracy Morgan: Staying Alive." (Cara Howe) Robert LloydContact ReporterTelevision Critic In June 2014, comedian Tracy Morgan, formerly of "Saturday Night Live" and lately late of "30 Rock," was returning to New York from a show in Delaware when the minibus in which he was riding was struck from behind by a Wal-Mart truck. Fellow comic James "Jimmy Mack" McNair was killed; Morgan was hospitalized with broken bones and a brain injury. He was briefly in a coma. Almost two years later, Morgan made his return to the stage with his Picking Up the Pieces tour; an October appearance in Red Bank, N.J., not far from where the accident happened, was filmed for Netflix, which has been investing in high-profile stand-up specials by comics including Dave Chappelle, Louis C.K., Amy Schumer, Maria Bamford and Jim Gaffigan. Morgan's premieres Tuesday for streaming, under the title "Tracy Morgan: Staying Alive." The special begins with a filmed opening, with nods to "Saturday Night Fever," as Morgan cruises Brooklyn with a Wal-Mart bag full of settlement money; he buys three slices of pizza instead of two, and he eats them piled one on top of another. A gag transports him into a John Travolta white suit and onto the stage of the theater, which is set with a table and armchair into which he occasionally collapses. One suspects this may be a matter of necessity, but mostly, he is on his feet and moving, encouragingly, and carrying an hour of material in his head. There is a shape to it; with a few video projections and lighting cues, you could call it a theater piece. Jokes and digressions are threaded on the story of his accident and recovery — in the coma, coming out of the coma, after the coma, on Earth and in heaven: "When I was in that coma, y'all, I saw that white light, but I didn't go to it, because I thought it was police. I got warrants, man. You can't get into heaven with priors." Donna Summer's "On the Radio" makes a motif. To be sure, the hour is rife with “F” words, “B” words, “P” words and other words I can't write in this paper and would avoid even if I could. Morgan has provoked controversy for his jokes before, including editorial chastisement from this paper over remarks about homosexuality (for which he apologized). As with all comedy, mileage varies, from listener to listener, and for any given listener, from joke to joke; you don't decide what to laugh at, after all, you just laugh, or you don't. Cara Howe Tracy Morgan Tracy Morgan (Cara Howe) I laughed at times, winced at others. But Morgan stays mostly within bounds here; not everyone will like his impression of a joint-rolling Jesus, or his sexual meditations on Caitlyn Jenner, or his taste for breast milk ("and Splenda"). Apart from taking shots at members of his own family ("Because of my settlement, they think I'm supposed to pay for everybody's funeral…. They think I'm supposed to put all their kids in college"), he stays largely positive. His recovery is not only physical but also spiritual — a pitch for self-acceptance, self-improvement and maturity, relatively speaking. He argues for fidelity, restraint and age-appropriate dancing: “When you get to a certain age, this is dancing,” he says demonstrating. “Two-stepping, that’s all you got to do, just one move — stomach out, stomach in, stomach out, stomach in.” Morgan allows himself a smile now and again, but mostly, he is intent and intense — which is not to say angry. ("I forgave that driver," he says of the man who hit him. "I'm not even mad at him," and notes, "When I was in a wheelchair I still shopped at Wal-Mart — you still can't beat their prices.") If comedy concerts don't always translate well to the screen — it's an art best experienced in the room, surrounded by laughter — there are moments, between lines, when the camera does its work. Moving in close, it gives us a glimpse of the comic as human, even more intimate than his altogether unembarrassed prepared remarks. ‘Tracy Morgan: Staying Alive’ Where: Netflix When: Anytime, starting Tuesday Caption Justin Chang revews ‘King Arthur: Legend of the Sword', directed by Guy Ritchie, starring Charlie Hunnam, Àstrid Bergès-Frisbey, Djimon Hounsou, Jude Law, Eric Bana, Aidan Gillen.

Photo Credit: AP advertisement | advertise on newsday Two former Wal-Mart Stores Inc employees have filed a lawsuit accusing the retailer of treating thousands of pregnant workers as “second-class citizens” by rejecting their requests to limit heavy lifting, climbing on ladders and other potentially dangerous tasks.     The proposed class action lawsuit was filed in federal court in Illinois on Friday by Talisa Borders and Otisha Woolbright, who say that until 2014, Arkansas-based Wal-Mart had a company-wide policy that denied pregnant women the same accommodations as workers with other disabilities.     Most Popular Village sees growth spurt ahead of summer Clare Rose, in midst of strike, to hire ‘new full-time’ workers LIer earns $1.6B, named to top hedge fund manager list Hamptons luxury bus line to start daily service Father-son duo creates cybersecurity tool The class could include at least 20,000 women and possibly up to 50,000 who worked at Wal-Mart while pregnant before the policy change, according to the lawsuit.  The company in a statement provided by spokesman Randy Hargrove denied the women's claims and said Wal-Mart's pregnancy policies "have always fully met or exceeded both state and federal law." The company said a separate anti-discrimination policy it maintains has long listed pregnancy as a protected status. "Walmart is a great place for women to work," the company said. Borders and Woolbright say that Wal-Mart's old policy violated a federal law requiring employers to treat pregnancy as a temporary disability and provide work accommodations to pregnant women. The U.S. Supreme Court, in a 2015 case involving United Parcel Service, said employers cannot treat pregnant workers differently from those with other disabilities or medical conditions.     Wal-Mart, the largest private U.S. employer, changed its policy in 2014 to treat pregnancy as a disability. But lawyers for the plaintiffs in the lawsuit say the changes did not go far enough, and they were planning a separate lawsuit involving the new policy.      advertisement | advertise on newsday Woolbright says her manager at a Florida Wal-Mart told her pregnancy was “no excuse” for not doing heavy lifting. She says she was fired from her job in the deli department after injuring herself lifting trays that weighed up to 50 pounds and inquiring further about the company’s pregnancy policies.     Borders, who worked at an Illinois Wal-Mart, says she was reprimanded for asking coworkers to climb ladders and lift heavy boxes while she was pregnant, and forced to go on unpaid leave. When she returned, she says, she was paid $2.00 less per hour. The case is Borders v. Wal-Mart Stores Inc, U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois, No. 3:17-cv-00506.

Thanks to, um, Element? That budget TV brand, best known for Black Friday specials at Target and Wal-Mart, is now selling the first 4K smart TVs to feature Amazon's Fire TV system built-in. Element's so-called Amazon Fire TV Edition sets include that system's thousands of TV apps and games, without the need to attach an external box or stick. And Alexa, Amazon's ubiquitous voice assistant, is on-board too. We got the chance to check out the new Amazon-powered TVs, first introduced in January, at a hands-on event in New York in May. At first blush they seem like worthy competitors to budget Roku TVs by brands like TCL, especially for Alexa fans who watch TV via an antenna. Here's what we know so far. 35 Amazon Alexa, now part of an Element TV Push to talk, not always listening Before you get too worked up, there's one crucial difference between these televisions and more well-known Alexa-powered gadgets like the Amazon Echo. Instead of speaking your commands into thin air prefaced by "Alexa...," you'll have to talk into the TV's remote while you hold down the mic button, and there's no need to invoke her by name. The TV isn't always on and always listening. Alexa's voice still talks back through the TV's speakers, however, and can augment her responses with onscreen displays, to show a weather report, for example. If this kind of functionality seems familiar, that's because it has existed for the last couple of years in Amazon's Fire TV devices, for example the $40 Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote. And for almost as long we've been complaining about the lack of integration between Alexa and entertainment devices (Harmony notwithstanding). The Fire TV Edition sets do little to assuage those complaints -- there's no way for an Echo to control anything on the TV directly, for example, like Google Home can with Chromecast and some TVs. Amazon reps said they might add that kind of functionality in the future, but didn't have anything to announce yet. In the meantime, here's how the Element TVs stack up. Amazon Fire TV Edition TVs Brand Model Size Price Element EL4KAMZ4317 43-inch $450 Element EL4KAMZ5017 50-inch $550 Element EL4KAMZ5517 55-inch $650 Element EL4KAMZ6517 65-inch $900 A Roku by any other name And if building a streaming stick or box into a TV seems familiar, that's because Roku has been doing it since 2014 with TVs built by TCL, Hisense, Hitachi, Sharp and others. Roku TVs have been among CNET's favorite budget models for years thanks to their ease of use and inexpensive prices, and they routinely top Amazon's own best-seller lists. Amazon is mostly following Roku's playbook with its Fire TV Edition models, down to the budget pricing. TVs powered by Roku offer more options in terms of sizes and features, however; TCL alone will sell more than 25 different models of Roku TV in 2017, and many of them offer high-end features like Dolby Vision, local dimming and enhanced styling. The Element TVs have 4K resolution but lack extras like local dimming and high dynamic range, as well as neat features like Roku's signature headphone jack-equipped remote. They rely on Alexa to compete. Sarah Tew/CNET Alexa, meet the TV antenna Just other Fire TV gear, Alexa on the Element TVs will respond to voice commands via her own voice and on-screen displays, and works with thousands of Alexa skills. She can control lights, thermostats and other smart home gadgets, answer questions about the weather and local restaurants, call an Uber or play music. You can also use voice to search for TV shows and movies, launch apps, fast-forward and pause in compatible apps and even switch inputs. The voice stuff worked well during Amazon's hands-on demo, but the other differentiator that struck me, compared to Roku, was Amazon's superior handling of TV received via an over-the-air antenna -- a staple for some users who cut the cable TV cord. Sarah Tew/CNET Unlike Roku there's an actual grid-style program guide and it's superb, with 14 days of info, network names, show information and thumbnail images. You can use commands like "Alexa, go to PBS," antenna shows are also integrated into the main menu system and included in search, and just like with Roku you can pause live TV. I still like Roku's menus better because they're fully customizable and don't push one content provider (like, well, Amazon) more than others. The Fire TV Edition sets have Amazon's latest menu design, which does a better job than before of surfacing TV shows and movies from third-party providers like Netflix and HBO Now, but it's still relatively Amazon-heavy. And like Roku the app selection is vastly superior to home-brew Smart TV systems like Samsung's and LG's, with thousands of apps and games. You can even connect a Bluetooth game controller. Element's Amazon Fire TV Edition TVs are available for preorder today at Amazon, and early birds can get a $15 antenna for free while supplies last. Other retailers, namely Target and Meijer, will follow in June. June is also when Westinghouse-branded Amazon Fire TV edition sets will appear at other retailers. They're identical in every way, save for branding and model names, to these Element models, but they won't be sold at the same stores. The Westinghouse and Element TV brands are manufactured by TongFang, a Chinese TV maker that also sells products under the Seiki brand. (Disclosure: The Westinghouse brand as it appears on consumer electronics is licensed by CBS, the parent company of CNET.) We're looking forward to reviewing the Amazon Fire TV Edition sets soon.

The surveillance footage, released by the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office on Wednesday, shows Michael Foster, 43, tackling Clarence Daniels from behind as he was walking into a Brandon, Fla. Wal-Mart on Tuesday. Foster followed Daniels into the store after seeing him exiting his vehicle with a gun holstered under his shirt — which was perfectly legal for the 62-year-old Daniels to do since he holds a concealed weapon license. Nevertheless, Foster tackled Daniels from behind as he entered the store, and put him in a chokehold before taking him to the ground. Witnesses said that Foster yelled out that Daniels had a gun. They also said that Daniels yelled out that he had a license for it. Foster called 911 only after he tackled accosted Daniels. He was arrested and charged with battery.

Everybody knows I got hit by the (expletive) Walmart truck,” says the comedian at the top of his Netflix stand-up show Staying Alive, shot at New Jersey’s Count Basie Theatre in October and available to stream on Netflix. “It could’ve been worse,” Morgan jokes. “I could’ve been injured by “a Bob’s Discount Furniture truck, driven by some dude name Rico.” Much like the way comedian Tig Notaro turned her breast cancer diagnosis into an iconic standup set, Morgan mines his personal hell -- eight days in a coma and months of rigorous physical and speech therapy -- for comedy. He mostly succeeds with original jokes that reassure the audience that he’s still got it, even after breaking “every bone in my face,” as he says. Morgan's stand-up show opens with him walking around town with a Walmart bag.  (Photo: Netflix) “When I was in my wheelchair, I still shopped at Walmart. You can’t beat (their) prices,” he says, making light of his accident. “After my settlement, everything went up a penny.” Morgan doesn’t use notes, doesn’t take breaks and doesn’t need water. Instead, he goes for an hour straight, pacing the stage and opting to sit only when the position works well with a story he’s telling. He's at his best when recalling his short stint in heaven, where he met everyone from Elvis to Biggie (“looks good, lost weight”) and Jesus (“He’s cool—he’s New Testament.”). The comic’s breakdown of his dysfunctional relatives (“They give you the strength and motivation to get better… so you can get away from them”) and dynamics of his new marriage also offer plenty of laughs. But the comedy special's not all giggles. Morgan gets sentimental and might make viewers watery-eyed when he shows love for his devoted fans, for his young daughter whom he took his first post-accident steps with and even for the truck driver who put him in the hospital. “I forgave the driver that hit me,” Morgan says, before hitting fans with a great punchline. “I tell you who is mad at me... All of my white neighbors.” So there’s no need to worry: After all of the time away from standup, it’s still classic, goofy Morgan on that stage, with plenty of dirty jokes about breasts, butts, penises and reality stars, namely Caitlyn Jenner, whom he devotes plenty of cringe-inducing time to. Morgan's special is called 'Staying Alive.' So of course he dressed in disco duds. Mostly.  (Photo: Netflix) And if for some reason you needed more convincing that the guy who embodies the erratic Tracy Jordan on 30 Rock is back, it becomes very clear when a female fan unexpectedly shouts at Morgan from the crowd. “I love you, too,” replies Morgan. Then he tells the woman to flash him.

The airline industry says its rate of mishandled baggage is lower than ever, which the the air transport technology company SITA attributes largely to investments by airlines and airports in technology improvements. (Travis Dove/The New York Times)   By Martha White The New York Times May 16, 2017   Today’s Business stories Eugene Airport traveler numbers rise on strength of Delta’s Seattle flights Toy fad spirals out of control State insurers seek rate hikes Business Highlights ESPN assures advertisers it’s responding to cord-cutters: ‘We’re making changes’ More Business »   Sleep versus clean clothes: This was the dilemma faced by Bill Corbett Jr., a public relations firm owner who, after a four-hour flight delay, arrived in Denver around 3:30 in the morning last summer, only to discover that his suitcase had not made it onto the flight. “I had an important meeting with a client that started at 7:30,” he said. “I had a choice — I probably could’ve gone to an all-night Wal-Mart, but that would’ve taken me another hour.” In the end, sleep won. The missing bag, he said, “just caused a whole level of stress you don’t want to have when you’re in a business situation.” The airline industry says its rate of mishandled baggage is lower than ever. In fact, earlier this month, the air transport technology company SITA said the rate of mishandled bags worldwide was 5.73 per thousand last year, down more than 12 percent from 2015 and the lowest ever recorded. SITA attributed much of the reduction to investments by airlines and airports in technology improvements. Still, that is small comfort to the lone traveler waiting by a deserted carousel with a sinking feeling. Passenger aviation experts say there are myriad reasons a bag can go missing. (They prefer the terms “delayed” or “mishandled.”) “Weather and missed connections are by far the largest proportion” of causes for bags not arriving on time, said Gareth Joyce, senior vice president of airport customer service and cargo at Delta Air Lines. Mark Matthews, director of customer planning operations at American Airlines, agreed. “When you’re talking about hub-and-spoke carriers, there’s a lot of complexity about transferring bags to connecting flights,” he said. Shorter connection times also play a role. While passengers might be able to sprint to the next gate, their checked bags might not make it there as quickly. Damaged or torn-off tags, along with human error, are also contributors. “The human element can always throw a wrench into the works,” said George Hobica, founder of AirfareWatchdog.com, recalling a trip where he realized the agent checking him in had affixed the wrong luggage tag to his suitcase. “If I hadn’t caught it, it would’ve gone to God knows where,” he said. Jessica Sweet, a resident of Charlotte, North Carolina, recalled landing in New York around the holidays last year after a business trip without her checked bag — and a winter coat, which she had packed in her checked luggage. Her suitcase arrived about 24 hours later, but when it did, Sweet said her makeup bag and a pair of prescription sunglasses were missing. “It’s almost worth spending the extra money if I have a higher guarantee my bags will be there with me,” she said. Peter Drummond, baggage portfolio director at SITA, pointed to the new bag-handling data as evidence that investment in new technology and better baggage handling procedures had paid off. But, he said, the drop also coincided with the major carriers beginning to charge passenger fees for checking a bag. Those fees reduced the number of travelers checking bags. “When airlines started charging for checked baggage, that more than likely had an effect on the mishandled rate,” Dummond said. “But over that same time period, what we had is a vast increase in the use of technology for tracking bags as well.” The new bag tags are embedded with RFID chips (for radio-frequency identification), which means the location of bags is tracked and electronically cross-checked against a database to make sure that they are in the right place at the right time. Airline and airport management say this increases security, since each bag is linked to a ticketed passenger. It also speeds up the discovery of a bag in the wrong place so the process of reconnecting a bag to its owner can begin sooner. “RFID, from a customer experience point of view, has brought transparency to the customer,” Joyce, of Delta Air Lines, said. “We’ve invested about $50 million in deploying this tech across our organization,” he said. That investment includes integrating this data into the Delta mobile app. “If you’re traveling and you check a bag, you get a push notification when your bag is loaded,” Joyce said. Representatives from American, United and Southwest also said they were building similar systems with advanced bag-tracking capabilities. At most airports in the United States, the airlines have operational control of their terminals, so it is incumbent on them to add new technology. But Drummond said airports also had a stake in making sure their airlines were doing their job. “If an airport had a lot of mishandled bags and passengers see that, that reputation will precede that airport,” he said. “So the incentive there is with the airport as well.” That is one of the reasons the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates a portion of Newark Liberty International Airport’s Terminal B, has spent $2.3 million installing a more sophisticated, RFID-based tracking system. “As terminal operator, we have a responsibility to ensure a certain level of service in that terminal,” said Diane Papaianni, the airport’s general manager. That kind of tracking is going to become more the norm. By June of next year, the International Air Transport Association has stipulated that all airlines must maintain an accurate inventory of passenger baggage by tracking when each piece of checked luggage moves on, off or between planes. “It should help primarily with inter-carrier handoffs,” said Dan McKone, head of the travel and transport practice at L.E.K. Consulting. “Inter-carrier handoffs have the largest degree of mishandling.” “The knowledge that an airline has your bag, even if it’s being mishandled, creates peace of mind for the customer,” he said. Travelers say, though, that while they appreciate updates about where their errant luggage is, that is good only if the information is accurate. “While that’s great to know where it is, getting it back was probably a bigger issue for me,” said Rebecca Cohen, whose bag went astray on the Miami-to-New York leg of an extended trip. “Trying to contact people to resolve this was nearly impossible,” she said. Cohen said it took days for her bag to be returned, and the updates she received in the interim were inconsistent and even contradictory. “They did tell me it was in Miami and I could track it,” she said. “It didn’t show up. I called and they said it was actually still in Miami and the tracker was incorrect.” More Business articles »     RG Business Local business news sent to your inbox every Thursday.         Today’s Business stories Transportation Eugene Airport traveler numbers rise on strength of Delta’s Seattle flights Business Toy fad spirals out of control Business State insurers seek rate hikes Business ESPN assures advertisers it’s responding to cord-cutters: ‘We’re making changes’ Business Business Highlights     Opinion Editorial Make way for tiny houses State building codes should accommodate them Tiny houses won’t end homelessness in Oregon.

The Hollywood Reporter Movies TV Business Style Politics Tech Culture Awards Video Subscribe Newsletters Pilots Guide Premieres Renewal Scorecard This Is Us Grey's Empire Walking Dead Game of Thrones May 16, 2017 6:46pm PT by Hilary Lewis Tracy Morgan on Joking About Accident, "Authentic" Intro for Stand-Up Special Cara Howe/Netflix The comedian's latest, 'Staying Alive,' is streaming on Netflix. Tracy Morgan's Netflix special Staying Alive, now streaming, is just the latest step in the comedian's high-profile return to the spotlight after his near fatal car accident in 2014. The accident, in which a Walmart truck slammed into the back of a limo-van carrying Morgan and two others, features prominently in the hour-long program. Morgan kicks off his set with multiple jokes about surviving the crash that left him seriously injured, his recovery and his lucrative settlement. Later, he pays tribute to his friend, comedian James "Jimmy Mack" McNair, who died in the accident. Staying Alive is not only a reference to Morgan's survival, but that title also allows him to do a Saturday Night Fever-inspired opening soundtracked by the Bee Gees song of the same name. Morgan is the latest high-profile comic to do a special for Netflix, joining Amy Schumer, Dave Chappelle, Jerry Seinfeld, Chris Rock and Louis C.K. in partnering with the streaming service. Morgan spoke to The Hollywood Reporter about joining Netflix's roster of comedic talent, joking about his accident and making the special's opening "authentic." Why did you want to do a special for Netflix as opposed to another channel or platform? Netflix was on its way to becoming the juggernaut that it is. If you see the stable of people [who are doing specials for Netflix], I just thought that I would be in good company. Dave Chappelle, [Amy] Schumer, [Chris] Rock, Louis CK. All of these people. And they're all great stand-ups and I wanted to be a part of that. When I was clear enough to do a special, Netflix was my first choice. I wanted to tell my story on Netflix. There's a fair amount of material about your accident and the settlement. What made you feel comfortable enough to joke about that? Because I forgave myself and I allowed myself to go there. I forgave the driver, and I was able to move forward. So it wasn't painful, it was funny. It turned into funny. Everything painful in my life that ever happened to me, all of the mistakes I made, I forgave myself. So I'm able to do that. Once you forgive yourself you're able to laugh it off. Once you forgive yourself! Because we're only human. Are there any parts of the crash that you wouldn't want to joke about because they're too painful? Jimmy Mack's death. It wasn't anything that happened to me. All of those other folks in there, I didn't think that anything that happened to them was funny. I just joked about me. There is a reference to Jimmy Mack toward the end of the special. In heaven. Yes. Why did you want to pay tribute to him that way? Because I know that's where he's at, and I will see him again and when I see him again he's going to be laughing. He'll go, "Tracy, that was some funny shit that you said!" Because I know Jimmy Mack! Talk to me about filming the Saturday Night Fever-inspired opening sequence. People love that song. People love that movie. It was a hit! I thought it was an appropriate thing to say, "staying alive," because that's what I'm doing, through my special, through my work. Me and you here doing the interview. That's staying alive. You know how many stand-ups would have just folded? You know how many people would have just folded like a cheap suit? Now I'm staying alive in the game, doing stand-up. Staying alive, baby. You really went for it in terms of re-creating the opening. Was that fun? That was great. I just thought it was great. All of the people involved, everyone that had a hand in it, I'd like to thank them. I just thought it was an appropriate thing to do. We went back to the same street, and it was the same pizza shop. Authenticity means a lot to me, and I wanted to make it authentic. It just sparked nostalgia. You remember where you were in life. You remember your age, all of that, when that movie came out. I hope a bunch of people pull out some cocaine, start sniffing. (Laughs.) Because that was it. That was the disco era. Why did you film the special at the Count Basie Theatre in Red Bank, N.J.? We had a number of theaters that I was shown. Red Bank is local. I live in Jersey, and I just loved the way the theater looked. And I remember a long time ago Chris Rock telling me, when a theater's beautiful, you're going to perform that way. I just thought that was a beautiful place to perform, so I put it down there.

Sign Up Online Newspaper SectionsSubscribe Local Business Feds and big retailers: Canned tuna companies colluded to fix prices By MARTHA MENDOZA Associated Press12:18 am BANGKOK (AP) – Executives of the most popular tuna brands in the U.S. – Chicken of the Sea, Bumble Bee and StarKist – conspired regularly to keep prices high for consumers with a taste for one of America’s favorite sandwich ingredients, according to criminal and civil court records updated this week. A typical can of tuna today costs about $1.50 and the U.S. Department of Justice says that price may be the result of price fixing by Thai, South Korean and U.S. seafood dealers, while major retailers are suing alleging they’ve been ripped off. The U.S. government began investigating criminal price fixing between the three companies more than 2 years ago. Together the companies supply about 80 percent of the $1.7 billion of canned tuna sold annually in the United States, according to the court records. Following up, Walmart and other top retailers filed civil lawsuits. Those cases were updated this week with an appendix first reported by Undercurrent News that singles out dozens of tuna executives, roping in some of the wealthiest businessmen in Thailand, where Chicken of the Sea’s parent company, Thai Union, is based. “Thai Union does not comment on ongoing legal matters,” the company said in a statement. The other firms did not respond immediately for requests for comment. The litigation describes regular telephone calls and meetings where “executives agreed that all three companies would collective raise prices.” They also agreed to “limit promotions and packaged tuna that undercut their published pricing,” according to court records. Thai Union’s president and CEO Thiraphong Chansiri, his father Kraisorn Chansiri and dozens of other Thai and American executives are now identified specifically in the ongoing case. Thai Union owns Chicken of the Sea, Red Lobster and U.S. Pet Nutrition, among other companies. In-Gu Park, acting president of South Korea-based Dongwon Enterprise, which owns StarKist, and Chris Lischewski, president and CEO of San Diego-based Bumble Bee also were named in the court records. Although fewer Americans eat tuna every year, it’s still a mainstay in most kitchens and the country’s favorite type of fish. Canned tuna was popularized during World War I, when it was a convenient protein for troops who returned home and continued to ask for it. Last week in the criminal case in San Francisco, Bumble Bee Foods said it would plead guilty to a felony charge of conspiring to fix the prices of canned and pouched tuna, and pay a $25 million fine. The announcement came after two Bumble Bee executives, senior vice-presidents Ken Worsham and Walter Scott Cameron, also pleaded guilty. They agreed to cooperate with authorities in the ongoing investigation, and face jail time and fines.

Updated 4 hours ago BANGKOK — Executives of the most popular tuna brands in the United States — Chicken of the Sea, Bumble Bee and StarKist — conspired regularly to keep prices high for consumers with a taste for one of America's favorite sandwich ingredients, according to criminal and civil court records updated this week. A typical can of tuna today costs about $1.50 and the Department of Justice says that price may be the result of price fixing by Thai, South Korean and U.S. seafood dealers, while major retailers are suing alleging they've been ripped off. The U.S. government began investigating criminal price fixing between the three companies more than two years ago. Together the companies supply about 80 percent of the $1.7 billion of canned tuna sold annually in the United States, according to the court records. Following up, Walmart and other top retailers filed civil lawsuits. Those cases were updated this week with an appendix first reported by Undercurrent News that singles out dozens of tuna executives, roping in some of the wealthiest businessmen in Thailand, where Chicken of the Sea's parent company Thai Union is based. “Thai Union does not comment on ongoing legal matters,” the company said in a statement.

Ewing was acquitted of aggravated indecent liberties and aggravated criminal sodomy with a child younger than 14 years old in April. The prosecutor in the case questioned whether a juror whose husband posted comments about the case should be allowed to remain in the jury pool. The judge allowed the juror to stay. (Illustration/The Capital-Journal) After the husband of a juror in the first trial of Jacob C. Ewing, a Holton man accused of multiple sex crimes, called the case “a witch hunt” on social media, the prosecution questioned her ability to remain unbiased during the case, according to transcripts released Tuesday. The woman ultimately was allowed to remain on the panel, which acquitted Ewing in April of aggravated indecent liberties and aggravated criminal sodomy with a child younger than 14 years old. But the exchange captured in the transcript of the closed-door hearing and obtained by The Topeka Capital-Journal highlighted concerns from special prosecutor Jacqie Spradling about the tight-knit nature of the small town in Jackson County. When questioned, the juror admitted she didn’t want to be on the panel for fear of running into parties involved in the case. “Because it’s just a high-profile case and, regardless of which way it goes, who wants to go to Walmart and run into, you know, the victims’ advocates or, opposite end, the defendant’s family?” the transcript quotes her as saying. “You know, it’s just not something that’s going to be comfortable.” Ewing, 22, of Holton, also faces five counts of rape, one count of attempted rape, two counts of aggravated sexual battery and six counts of aggravated criminal sodomy. Trials are scheduled in June, August and October. Last week, he was charged with 13 felony counts of sexual exploitation of child-related viewing or possessing child pornography. The transcript details a closed-door hearing April 20 in District Judge Norbert Marek’s chambers before the jury deliberated in the case involving the underage girl. The Capital-Journal requested the transcript April 21, and Marek allowed release to the public after denying a motion from defense attorney Kathleen Ambrosio to seal the record on May 5. It was released Tuesday. At issue for the court and attorneys during a conference were posts from the juror’s husband on a Facebook page dedicated to Holton. In the posts, made shortly after the jury was dismissed April 18, he questioned the age of the alleged victim, who was 13 at the time of the incident in 2014. He also described the trial as a “witch hunt,” according to the transcript. Spradling and Ambrosio questioned the juror about whether she disclosed information about the case with her husband or the public. Jurors are barred from discussing ongoing cases outside of deliberation, and both attorneys were concerned about the couple’s relationship. The woman denied communicating with her husband about the case and said his feelings about Ewing’s guilt or innocence wouldn’t affect her decision. “I’m very independent and a very independent thinker, and he doesn’t — something like this, he doesn’t influence my thinking,” the juror said. “It’s not like we’re deciding whether to have turkey or ham for Thanksgiving, you know. It’s a very serious, serious matter.” Spradling was also concerned with the possibility the juror’s husband had a relationship with Ewing’s family. The juror’s husband had lived in Holton for most of his life and knew “everyone from the community, for the most part,” but the juror didn’t believe he regularly associated with Ewing’s family. Marek cautioned the woman about her husband’s posts drawing undue attention to jurors while the trial was underway. “This isn’t an order — he needs to keep his yap shut,” he said. The juror expressed disapproval of her husband’s posts. “I apologize for my husband,” she said. The woman’s statements convinced Ambrosio the juror could remain objective, she told the judge, who agreed. “He said it was a witch hunt. That’s his opinion,” she said. “That doesn’t mean it’s her opinion, it doesn’t mean it was conveyed to her, doesn’t mean that they discussed it.” Spradling, however, requested a replacement juror. She argued the woman’s reluctance to serve, including avoiding public places, was enough to preclude her from deliberating the case. “(The juror) told us is that, either way the verdict went, she would hang her head low if she had to go to Walmart. She also indicated that, unfortunately, she has had to acknowledge that she’s on the jury,” she said. “This is a person who, through no fault of her own, I’m sure, has been put in a situation where I cannot see that she would be fair to both sides.” Contact reporter Luke Ranker at (785) 295-1270 or @lrankerNEWS on Twitter.

Umatilla County Sheriff Terry Rowan said Deputy Calvin Mead initiated a traffic stop at South Edward and Walls Road, but the vehicle continued to drive along Highway 207, going about 50 miles per hour. Law enforcement vehicles chased the car, which stopped at Wal-Mart on North Highway 395. The vehicle’s passenger, Austin Satterwhite, was taken into custody in the parking lot. The driver, Timothy McMurphy, started running for the door of the store, but was apprehended before reaching it. Rowan said he did not know the reason for the traffic stop. McMurphy has previously been charged with several felonies, most recently his involvement in a scheme in Pendleton, making fake $100 bills. Satterwhite was charged last year with interfering with an officer and unlawful possession of a firearm.

VanderVelde sentenced Mario Garza on Tuesday to 17 years in prison for his role in shootout that ended with a 10-year-old girl accidentally being shot. Garza, 20, was arrested in June 2016 on a felony warrant in connection with a gang-related shooting in the parking lot of a Walmart during the annual God and Country Family Festival at the Ford Idaho Center in Nampa. According to police, Garza and another man, Ezri Garcia, began arguing in the parking lot when both men pulled out guns and started shooting at each other. A bullet from one of the guns struck an nearby 10-year-old girl in the shoulder while she was gathered with her family and hundreds of other people to watch the fireworks from the festival. VanderVelde sentenced Garza, of Nampa, for aggravated assault and felony riot, and he could be eligible for parole after six years are served. Garcia was sentenced in February to 19 years in prison with seven years fixed for his role in the shooting. VanderVelde also ordered Garza to have no contact with the victim or her family for the duration of the sentence. Garza was also ordered to pay a $5,000 civil penalty as well as court costs. “My office and our law enforcement partners in Canyon County have zero tolerance for gang violence, so there is no doubt that Mr. Garza belongs behind bars,” said Canyon County Prosecutor Bryan Taylor in a news release. “Hopefully this sends a message that gangs and gang violence will not be tolerated in our community.” Ruth Brown: 208-377-6207, @RuthBrownNews Ezri Garcia.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Peter Whoriskey By Peter Whoriskey May 16 at 7:08 PM Follow @PeterWhoriskey Here’s the funny thing about canned tuna: Even as Americans lost their taste for the fish and demand dropped steadily for years, the price of a can seemed to hold steady or rise. For some, it was an economic riddle. “Given what was happening to demand, the price of tuna should have declined,” said Andrew F. Smith, author of “American Tuna: The Rise and Fall of an Improbable Fish.” It didn’t. Now, there’s a new theory for the price of tuna. According to a lawsuit filed by one of the nation’s largest retailers, the price of tuna was held aloft because executives at the nation’s three largest tuna brands — Bumble Bee, Starkist and Chicken of the Sea — were colluding to fix prices. Citing email, industry conferences and phone calls, attorneys for Walmart allege that the tuna brands set the price of tuna in order to defy economic forces that ordinarily would have pushed prices down. Last week, in a related criminal case filed by the Justice Department, Bumble Bee Foods pleaded guilty to conspiring to fix prices sold in the United States between 2011 and 2013. The firm has agreed to pay a $25 million fine. In addition, two Bumble Bee senior vice presidents, Ken Worsham and Walter Scott Cameron, pleaded guilty to fixing prices. They agreed to cooperate with federal authorities in the ongoing criminal investigation. The Walmart lawsuit alleges a much broader and longer-lasting conspiracy among the three tuna brands. None of the three answered invitations to comment. “We believe there is strong evidence that suppliers of canned tuna to Walmart conspired to artificially inflate and wrongfully fix prices in order to increase their own profits at the expense of consumers,” said Randy Hargrove, a spokesman for Walmart. In Walmart’s view, laid out in court documents, the conspiracy among the three companies, which control about 80 percent of the U.S. market, began by 2010, at the latest, and lasted through July 2015. During that period, Walmart alleges it was overcharged by the tuna companies. “Senior executives met at least twice annually and regularly discussed prices and shared sensitive customer information,” according to the Walmart lawsuit. Walmart also alleged that the tuna companies agreed to spurn aggressive sales tactics — that is, they weren’t going to compete too hard. In the past, industry officials have described the steady or rising price of tuna as the result of scarce supply. And indeed, the wholesale price of the fish has fluctuated. But according to the May 2015 Food Outlook of the United Nations Food & Agriculture Organization tuna prices had dropped considerably in 2014: “tuna prices declined significantly due to excess supply, with frozen skipjack prices hitting a 6-year low.” Yet, according to Walmart, “despite changes in supply and demand that should have led to lower prices, [Walmart] continued to pay higher prices for packaged tuna products.” But the extent of the alleged collusion, according to Walmart, extended beyond price-fixing. According to the lawsuit, the tuna companies sought to resist pressure from environmental groups such as Greenpeace. Those groups were pushing to outlaw fishing methods that ensnare other animals besides the tuna, including endangered sea turtles and sharks. “Executives from Bumble Bee, Chicken of the Sea, and StarKist were concerned that a switch to a more sustainable method of fishing would decrease supply and put pressure on their margins,” according to the lawsuit. Citing emails, the Walmart attorneys said that the companies agreed in February 2012 not to sell tuna branded as “FAD-free” or free of the devices blamed for the excessive taking of sea creatures. The lawsuit comes as the canned tuna industry continues to decline as an American staple. Some of its fall is blamed on Americans turning to fresh fish; some of it was fear of mercury in tuna; other seafoods have become more popular. Whatever the cause, without tuna’s slide in popularity, the collusion and its discovery might never have happened. The shrinking of tuna sales has led to a series of mergers, and it was one such merger that helped spur the interest of federal prosecutors. In December 2014, Thai Union, the owner of the Chicken of the Sea brand, announced it would acquire Bumble Bee for $1.5 billion. A year later, Thai Union suspended the proposal after announcing that federal investigators had begun an antitrust investigation into the industry. The troubles in the industry also led the big brands to work together, creating a setting that Walmart attorneys suggest was ripe for collusion. In 2011, the three brands, as part of the Tuna Council, paid for an advertising campaign to revive American interest in canned tuna. “Tuna the Wonderfish,” was the name of the campaign. That didn’t work either. In 1990, per capita consumption of canned tuna was 3.9 pounds and by 2011, it was 2.6 pounds. And despite the campaign, it kept declining. By 2013, the figure had dropped to 2.3 pounds. business economy true Please provide a valid email address. Sign up You’re all set!

Its school system ran on a $2.3 million deficit last year, according to state auditors. County officials say they’re not likely to get a big sales tax source any time soon. “You’re not going to have Wal-Mart or anything like that,” County Commission Chairman Todd Adams said. “There’s not enough support.” That’s why the cash-strapped county is seeking a carve-out in Forever Wild Land, a 25-year-old program that set up a state-funded nonprofit to buy environmentally sensitive land for public use. Forever Wild lands are exempt from property taxes. The state Legislature is considering two separate proposals — one that would affect just Coosa County and another for the entire state — that would require Forever Wild to pay counties back for property tax lost on the program’s lands. Both proposals are state constitutional amendments, which means that each would come before voters on a future ballot if they’re approved by the Legislature. “Being a revenue-strapped county, we need to keep every cent in the county,” said Bridget Graham, the Coosa County administrator. The Forever Wild Land Trust now manages nearly 250,000 acres of land statewide, including well-known public spaces such as the bike trail system on Anniston’s Coldwater Mountain. Management of the land is paid for through interest on the state’s leases on oil and gas drilling rights in Mobile Bay. The proposed amendments would require the state to set aside additional money from those leases to pay counties back, but state law caps the total outlay to Forever Wild at $15 million per year. Former state Sen. Doug Ghee of Anniston, who played a role in drafting the original Forever Wild bill, said requiring Forever Wild to reimburse the counties for lost taxes would take a big dent out of the trust’s annual revenues. He thinks state government could find money elsewhere without dipping into the Forever Wild Land Trust. “It would only be a drop in the bucket to the state treasurer,” said Ghee, who now practices law in Anniston. Rep. Ron Johnson, R-Sylacauga, said the situation is much different for rural counties. He said the Forever Wild Land Trust is taking money away from Coosa County that could contribute to the school system, repairing roads and bridges, and other projects. “It’s butchering small counties,” said Johnson, a sponsor of both the statewide and the Coosa County proposals. At least some of the 11,000 acres of Forever Wild’s Coosa Wildlife Management Area are in Coosa County; Forever Wild’s board of directors in February discussed possibly adding 1,500 more. Coosa County’s government spends about $6.6 million per year, a small sum compared to other Alabama counties. An audit by the state Examiners of Public Accounts showed Coosa County Schools spending about $10 million last year —  $2 million more than schools brought in. County officials say the deficit is closer to $900,000. A representative with the Forever Wild Land Trust said the organization did not wish to comment, but does not support the bills. Ghee said the amendments could prevent the program from expanding and protecting the state’s next Walls of Jericho or Wehle Tract because the program would be using that money to pay off taxes. “It would be a sad day in Alabama if that bill passes,” Ghee said. For Coosa County, the amendment would provide the area with a fresh start. County officials did not release how much revenue would be recouped, but Graham said a lawyer would need to assess the land values. With bills to pay and land an important source of revenue, Adams said the county can’t keep giving up their land. “Before you know it, they’re going to have the county,” Adams said. The statewide version of the amendment appeared Tuesday to be stalled in the House of Representatives. With three days left in the Legislative session, it’s unlikely to pass. The Coosa County amendment has passed the House and could come before the Senate for a vote this week.

Zoom, which has worldwide rights to the Motorola brand for products such as cable modems, gateways, WiFi routers and range extenders, achieved the CableLabs milestone following cert wave 120. The MB8600 isn’t at retail yet, but it has shown up on this Walmart web page (but not yet available for sale) with packaging indicating that Comcast, which has been expanding the rollout of DOCSIS 3.1, has also certified the product to work on its network. Like other DOCSIS 3.1 modems, the Motorola MB8600 is a hybrid that supports both DOCSIS 3.1 and DOCSIS 3.0 signals. The D3.0 side of the product can bond up to 32 downstream channel and up to eight upstream channels. Zoom said the MB8600 features four Gigabit Ethernet ports, support for bonded Ethernet ports, and Broadcom full-band capture digital tuning. Zoom’s new Moto-branded model will tangle at retail with D3.1-certified products from Arris and Netgear. Other vendors to obtain the D3.1 certification stamp from  CableLabs include Hitron, Humax, Askey, CastleNet, Sagemcom, Technicolor, and Ubee Interactive. On its recent Q1 call, Zoom said more than 5,600 stores are now carrying modems with the Motorola brand as of March 31, and that its cable modem share on Amazon.com has grown from less than 1% at the start of 2016, to over 15%. Zoom’s products are carried in stores such as Best Buy, MicroCenter, Target and  Walmart. About 10% to 15% of the DOCSIS CPE market is for retail products, according to SNL Kagan’s Jeff Heynen. For Q1, Zoom posted net sales of $5.1 million, up 89.1% from $2.7 million in the year-ago quarter. That was paired with a net loss of $1.1 million, or 7 cents per share, versus a year-ago loss of $700,000, or 5 cents per share. Zoom attributed the wider loss to increases in advertising expenses, R&D, and Motorola trademark royalties, which rose to $755,000 in Q1, according to company CEO Frank Manning. Though Zoom is largely focused on the retail market, it has recent embarked on a strategy to expand to service provider sales. On the call, Manning estimated that $7.5 million quarter revenues represents Zoom’s break-even mark.

(Photo: Eugene Hoshiko / AP) 2 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Executives of the most popular tuna brands in the U.S. — Chicken of the Sea, Bumble Bee and StarKist — conspired regularly to keep prices high for consumers with a taste for one of America’s favorite sandwich ingredients, according to criminal and civil court records updated this week. A typical can of tuna today costs about $1.50 and the U.S. Department of Justice says that price may be the result of price fixing by Thai, South Korean and U.S. seafood dealers, while major retailers are suing alleging they’ve been ripped off. The U.S. government began investigating criminal price fixing between the three companies more than two years ago. Together the companies supply about 80 percent of the $1.7 billion of canned tuna sold annually in the United States, according to the court records. Following up, Wal-Mart and other top retailers filed civil lawsuits. Those cases were updated this week with an appendix first reported by Undercurrent News that singles out dozens of tuna executives, roping in some of the wealthiest businessmen in Thailand, where Chicken of the Sea’s parent company, Thai Union, is based. “Thai Union does not comment on ongoing legal matters,” the company said in a statement. The other firms did not respond immediately for requests for comment. The litigation describes regular phone calls and meetings where executives agreed that all three companies would “raise prices.” They also agreed to “limit promotions and packaged tuna that undercut their published pricing,” according to court records. Thai Union’s president and CEO Thiraphong Chansiri, his father Kraisorn Chansiri and dozens of other Thai and American executives are now identified specifically in the ongoing case. Thai Union owns Chicken of the Sea, Red Lobster and U.S. Pet Nutrition, among other companies. In-Gu Park, acting president of South Korea-based Dongwon Enterprise, which owns StarKist, and Chris Lischewski, president and CEO of San Diego–based BumbleBee also were named in the court records. Although fewer Americans eat tuna every year, it’s still a mainstay in most kitchens and the country’s favorite fish. Canned tuna was popularized during World War I, when it was a convenient protein for troops, who returned home and continued to ask for it. Last week in the criminal case in San Francisco, Bumble Bee Foods said it would plead guilty to a felony charge of conspiring to fix the prices of canned and pouched tuna and pay a $25 million fine. The announcement came after two Bumble Bee executives, senior vice presidents Ken Worsham and Walter Scott Cameron, also pleaded guilty. They agreed to cooperate with authorities in the ongoing investigation and face jail time and fines. The FBI and Justice Department said their investigation into packaged seafood is aimed at protecting consumers, who deserve competitive prices. 2 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://detne.ws/2qpLrKT TOP VIDEOS Construction continues on M-59 1:51 Packard site owner: 'We will not fail' 2:56 QLine prepares for its debut 1:35 Patterson concerned about job skills gap 2:51 Mayor Mike Duggan on the new Flex-N-Gate facility 0:47 Ken Lingenfelter on his astounding car collection 2:30 IRS agent warns of tax scams 3:28 GM cars hoisted up to the Comerica Park fountain 0:50 Sen.

Kline (TMFDankline) May 16, 2017 at 4:58PM While the overall physical retail market has struggled, consumer-electronics sales have been booming, and you can largely thank Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) for that. The online giant, which passed Wal-Mart as the No. 2 electronics retailer in 2016, was expected to pass Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) for the top spot, according to Quartz. To put Amazon's impact into perspective, the company accounted for 90% of the $5.6 billion growth the consumer-electronics industry in 2015, according to an analyst note from Deutsche Bank sent in June 2016. That's an impressive feat for the online leader, but its success doesn't mean there's no room for other successful electronics retailers. Amazon is absolutely a must-buy in this space, but so are Best Buy and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Best Buy is kind of the last man standing when it comes to traditional electronis retailers on a national level. Image source: Best Buy. Best Buy has turned itself around There were a number of years when it seemed Best Buy would join Circuit City and Nobody Beats the Wiz in the retail graveyard along with Crazy Eddie. Amazingly, however, CEO Hubert Joly has led the company back. In 2012, when he took the job, the electronics retailer lost $3.36 per share. In its recently completed fiscal 2016, Best Buy reported diluted EPS of $3.74, up from $2.30 the previous year. The chain has steadily lost sales, but it has managed its expenses well and stopped what could have been a slide to oblivion by making major changes. The biggest of the may be matching Amazon's prices. That stopped the practice of showrooming, where consumers did their research at a Best Buy, eating up resources, and then bought on Amazon. The bricks-and-mortar retailer has also improved its stores by making them destinations with partner store-within-a-store concepts from Apple, Microsoft, Samsung, and various others. Amazon is the king Calling Amazon an electronics retailer is a bit like describing Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson as a reality-TV producer. Yes, he does have that job title, but it only describes a small part of what he does, Similarly, Amazon is an electronics retailer -- the largest one in the world, as I noted -- but the company doesn't even break out the category when it reports earnings. Amazon is a top electronics retailer because it's a top-everything retailer. The company, which grew sales by 23% year over year to $35.7 billion, is simply good at leveraging its audience to sell pretty much anything. In electronics, however, Amazon has helped itself by creating its own products. Though the company doesn't releases sales figures in this area, either, it has achieved some success with its Fire tablet line, its Kindle e-readers, and Fire TV. Recently it has what appears to be a major hit with its Echo family of products, which contain its Alexa artificial-intelligence-powered voice-controlled assistant. Apple has a lucrative niche Again, Apple is certainly not an electronics retailer first, but it does run a chain of stores. Those stores, according to 2016 data from eMarketer, have the highest sales per square foot of any retail chain. In fact, the iPhone maker came in at $5,546 a square foot, dramatically ahead of second-place Murphy USA, and nearly double third-place Tiffany & Co. The company generates sales that high because nearly everything it sells, aside from some cases, earbuds, and a few other items, costs more than $100. In addition, while Apple products are sold elsewhere, including Best Buy, the company's retail stores offer the Genius Bar, where consumers can make appointments to get technical help, receive training, and have broken products examined. Apple currently has 495 retail locations globally, as well as its online store. CFO Luca Maestri provided some detail during the company's Q2 earnings call, which was transcribed by Seeking Alpha (registration required): Our retail and online stores produced great results, with strong revenue growth in all our geographic segments and 18% growth overall. Visitors to our retail and online stores were up 16% over last year, and we added four new stores during the March quarter. And with the opening of our store in Dubai last week, we're now at 495 stores in 18 countries. The company has smartly limited the amount of stores it opens to make each one more special but not have so few that consumers can't access them. Apple has a nearly perfect retail strategy where its stores support its products, while also keeping customers happy and generating a staggering amount of sales for their square footage.  Daniel Kline owns shares of Apple.

Rapper arrested for inciting 'riot'Tue, 16 May 2017 6:10 PM Share Your Email This file photo taken on July 9, 2016 shows rapper Travis Scott performing at the Quebec City Summer Festival. / AFP PHOTO / Florence Cassisi     Rapper Travis Scott was arrested after a concert in Arkansas with police accusing him of "inciting a riot" as the crowd rushed to the stage, injuring several people. In the latest such incident for the 25-year-old, an enthusiastic crowd pushed through barricades to move closer to him at the arena concert Saturday night. Video footage posted online shows Scott energetically dancing and revving up the crowd but later asking fans to step back and politely thanking the fire marshals after completing his hit "Goosebumps." Police in northwestern Arkansas, best known as the corporate hub of retail behemoth Walmart, said that several people were injured including two involved in security. "During the concert Webster encouraged people to rush the stage and bypass the security protocols to ensure concert-goer safety," the police department in the town of Rogers said, referring to the rapper by his real name of Jacques Webster. "Webster was charged with inciting a riot, disorderly conduct and endangering the welfare of a minor," it said in a statement. Scott was released without bail, meaning he will need to return to Arkansas to hear the charges. The incident had echoes of Scott's 2015 performance at the Lollapalooza festival in Chicago where dozens of fans jumped barricades and onto the stage, ending his set within minutes. He was also arrested for disorderly conduct and ordered to remain under court supervision. Scott has been under an increasing spotlight as he has been romantically linked to Kylie Jenner, a member of the Kardashian celebrity clan.

That was impressive. Then last week, the company brought an updated version of the EP9 back to the Nordshliefe (north course) at the Nurburgring and set the outright fastest lap ever by a road legal production car — a blistering 6 minutes, 45.9 seconds. We have video of that lap below. “Production car” may require a bit of clarification. So far the company has made 6 of these 1,342 horsepower hypercars. Priced at $1.48 million a copy, you aren’t likely to see one in the parking lot at your local Walmart anytime soon. The EP9 has a top speed of 194 miles per hour, corners at up to 3Gs and generates a maximum of 5,395 pounds of aerodynamic downforce at speed. For those who don’t know, the Nurburgring race track opened in 1925. It was almost 19 miles long and had 173 turns — 89 to the left and 84 to the right. It is the track where Formula One world champion Nikki Lauda crashed and burned in 1976, an incident that was immortalized in the Ron Howard movie Rush. After that horrific accident, the entire track was deemed unsafe for modern racing cars and was broken into the 12.9 mile long Nordschliefe or northern circuit and the much shorter Südschliefe or southern circuit, which hosts grand prix races today. The Nio EP9 beat the lap set by the barely street legal Radical SR8LM’s by two seconds and the Lamborghini Huracán Performante by more than 6 seconds. The Lambo was the prior production car record holder. A few months back, the EP9 went around the Circuit of the Americas track outside of Austin, Texas in autonomous mode at an average speed of 160 miles per hour — pretty quick for a car with no human driver at the controls. Nio started life at NextEV before it was rebranded. In April, it brought its conventional looking electric SUV, the ES8, to the Shangai auto show. That car is expected to be the first car from the company to go into volume production.

Criminal and civil cases allege executives at the largest canned tuna companies were agreeing to collectively raise prices and limit promotions. Major retailers are taking aim at the most popular tuna brands in the U.S. — Chicken of the Sea, Bumble Bee and StarKist — saying they conspired to keep prices high for consumers. (AP Photo/Eugene Hoshiko) Feds and Walmart allege canned tuna prices fixed Tue May 16th, 2017 2:15pm Business You must sign in or register to continue reading content. BANGKOK — Executives of the most popular tuna brands in the U.S. — Chicken of the Sea, Bumble Bee and StarKist — conspired regularly to keep prices high for consumers with a taste for one of America’s favorite sandwich ingredients, according to criminal and civil court records updated this week. A typical can of tuna today costs about $1.50 and the U.S. Department of Justice says that price may be the result of price fixing by Thai, South Korean and U.S. seafood dealers, while major retailers are suing alleging they’ve been ripped off. The U.S. government began investigating criminal price fixing between the three companies more than two years ago. Together the companies supply about 80 percent of the $1.7 billion of canned tuna sold annually in the United States, according to the court records. Following up, Walmart and other top retailers filed civil lawsuits. Those cases were updated this week with an appendix first reported by Undercurrent News that singles out dozens of tuna executives, roping in some of the wealthiest businessmen in Thailand, where Chicken of the Sea’s parent company Thai Union is based. “Thai Union does not comment on ongoing legal matters,” the company said in a statement. The other firms did not respond immediately for requests for comment. The litigation describes regular telephone calls and meetings where “executives agreed that all three companies would collective raise prices.” They also agreed to “limit promotions and packaged tuna that undercut their published pricing,” according to court records. Thai Union’s president and CEO Thiraphong Chansiri, his father Kraisorn Chansiri and dozens of other Thai and American executives are now identified specifically in the ongoing case. Thai Union owns Chicken of the Sea, Red Lobster and U.S. Pet Nutrition, among other companies. In-Gu Park, acting president of South Korea-based Dongwon Enterprise, which owns StarKist, and Chris Lischewski, president and CEO of San Diego-based BumbleBee also were named in the court records. Although fewer Americans eat tuna every year, it’s still a mainstay in most kitchens and the country’s favorite type of fish. Canned tuna was popularized during World War 1, when it was a convenient protein for troops who returned home and continued to ask for it. Last week in the criminal case in San Francisco, Bumble Bee Foods said it would plead guilty to a felony charge of conspiring to fix the prices of canned and pouched tuna, and pay a $25 million fine. The announcement came after two Bumble Bee executives, senior vice-presidents Ken Worsham and Walter Scott Cameron, also pleaded guilty. They agreed to cooperate with authorities in the ongoing investigation, and face jail time and fines. The FBI and Justice Department said their investigation into packaged seafood is aimed at protecting consumers who deserve competitive prices.   Most Read Couple pays $5,495 owed for lunches at Marysville schools MARYSVILLE — On Friday, Tom and Christy Lee called the Marysville School… May 16th, 2017 by Chris Winters Failed Granite Falls off-road track sues for lost dirt money EVERETT — A lawsuit over an off-road motorcycle track once planned near… May 15th, 2017 by Noah Haglund Study: Crumb rubber cancer risk ‘at or below 1 in a million’ EVERETT — Tests conducted of crumb rubber sports fields in five cities,… May 15th, 2017 by Sharon Salyer See what you’d look like as a Funko character Here’s the must-do diversion of the day: See what you would look… May 15th, 2017 by Jim Davis What's Up With That?

Skip to content comics cosplay tv/film games Submit tip Contact CGC Insider Search for: The Ultimate 12 Inch Daredevil Figure Is Coming To SDCC Courtesy Of Hasbro Posted by Jeremy Konrad May 16, 2017 Comment Hasbro’s line of 12-inch Marvel Legends has had an interesting year, that’s for sure. Given a ton of fan-fare at last years SDCC during their Marvel presentation, initially when the first wave hit shelves they were tough gets. That lasted about a month, and then they were everywhere. I myself walked into a Walmart and picked up the Iron Man for $20, down from $50. E-tailers also offered them at steep discounts, and it looked like three figures: Spider-Man, Captain America, and Iron Man, were all that we may see. And the figures are awesome. Very poseable, they come with lots of accessories and great paint apps. Thankfully, we know now that they are in fact forging ahead with these. Deadpool is hitting shelves as we speak, with Hulk and Thor to come later this year. There is even a Black Suit Spider-Man exclusive coming to Target. If they have faith in this line, then so do I. Which makes today’s announcement tough, because I am going to want one of these badly. At SDCC this year, Hasbro will be offering an exclusive 12-inch Daredevil figure, and it looks incredible. The figure itself will come with two heads: masked and a Matt Murdock head, and a loose cowl. Then, not only three sets of hands, but a pair of wrapped wrists and forearms. Rounding out the accessories is his billy-club. If it is like every other one of these releases, it will be a fun figure to pose and the sculpt looks pretty great. The mask-less beat up head is ok, but that is the best part of interchangeable heads, you can just leave the masked version on. As with all of their SDCC exclusives, the packaging here is incredible. Featuring art by Joe Quesada, the box has a front flap that opens to reveal the figure inside the package, with a giant window frame like all the other 12-inch Marvel Legends. The other side of the flap features more Quesada art, and on the backside of the package there will be braille writing, which is a nice touch. Inside will also be two posters of the box art. If you are at the show, this guy will run you $59.99, which is only $10 more than these are at regular retail. If you are not lucky enough to be at the show, it will be available on Hasbro Toy Shop a week or so after the con, although getting one on there is almost harder than it is at the show itself. I would expect this figure to get a regular release, minus the fancy box and less accessories, later on as well.   First seen on Yahoo About the Author Latest Posts Contact About Jeremy Konrad Jeremy Konrad loves Star Wars and collecting action figures and collectibles.

With it has come a surging sense of disenfranchisement that has fuelled alienation and anger, and even bred nationalism and xenophobia. As people struggle to hold on to their shrinking share of the pie, their anxiety has created a political opening for opportunistic populists, shaking the world order in the process. The gap between rich and poor nowadays is mind-boggling. Oxfam has observed that the world’s eight richest people now own as much wealth as the poorest 3.6 billion. As US Senator Bernie Sanders recently pointed out, the Walton family, which owns Walmart, now owns more wealth than the bottom 42 per cent of the US population. I can offer my own jarring comparison. Using Credit Suisse’s wealth database, I found that the total wealth of the world’s three richest people exceeds that of all the people in three countries — Angola, Burkina Faso and the Democratic Republic of Congo — which together have a population of 122 million. To be sure, great progress on reducing extreme poverty — defined as consumption of less than $1.90 per day — has been achieved in recent decades. In 1981, 42 per cent of the world’s population lived in extreme poverty. By 2013 — the last year for which we have comprehensive data — that share had dropped to below 11 per cent. Piecemeal evidence suggests that extreme poverty now stands just above 9 per cent. That is certainly something to celebrate. But our work is far from finished. And, contrary to popular belief, that work must not be confined to the developing world. As Angus Deaton recently pointed out, extreme poverty remains a serious problem in rich countries, too. “Several million Americans — black, white and Hispanic — now live in households with per capita income of less than $2 per day,” he points out. Given the much higher cost of living (including shelter), he notes, such an income can pose an even greater challenge in a country like the US than it does in, say, India. This constraint is apparent in New York City, where the number of known homeless people has risen from 31,000 in 2002 to 63,000 today. (The true figure, including those who have never used shelters, is about 5 per cent higher.) This trend has coincided with a steep rise in the price of housing: over the last decade, rents have been rising more than three times as fast as wages. Ironically, the wealthy pay less, per unit, for many goods and services. A stark example is flying. Thanks to frequent flier programmes, wealthy travellers pay less for each mile they fly. While this makes sense for airlines, which want to foster loyalty among frequent fliers, it represents yet another way in which wealth is rewarded in the marketplace. This phenomenon is also apparent in poor economies. A study of Indian villages showed that the poor face systematic price discrimination, exacerbating inequality. In fact, correcting for differences in prices paid by the rich and the poor improves the Gini coefficient (a common measure of inequality) by 12-23 per cent. The better off also get a whole host of goods for free. To name one seemingly trivial example, I cannot remember when I last bought a pen. They often simply appear on my desk, unintentionally left behind by people who stopped by my office. They vanish just as often, as people inadvertently pick them up. The late Khushwant Singh, a renowned Indian journalist, once said that he attended conferences only to stock up on pens and paper. A non-trivial example is taxation. Rather than paying the most in taxes, the wealthiest people are often able to take advantage of loopholes and deductions that are not available to those earning less. Without having to break any rules, the wealthy receive what amount to subsidies, which would have a far larger positive impact if they were allocated to the poorest people. Beyond these concrete inequities, there are less obvious — but equally damaging — imbalances. In any situation where, legally, one’s rights are not enforced or even specified, the outcome will probably depend on custom, which is heavily skewed in favour of the rich. Wealthy citizens can not only vote; they can influence elections through donations and other means. In this sense, excessive wealth inequality can undermine democracy. Of course, in any well-run economy, a certain amount of inequality is inevitable and even needed, to create incentives and power the economy. But, nowadays, disparities of income and wealth have become so extreme and entrenched that they cross generations, with family wealth and inheritance having a far greater impact on one’s economic prospects than talent and hard work. And it works both ways: just as children from wealthy families are significantly more likely to be wealthy in adulthood, children of, say, former child labourers are more likely to work during their childhood. None of this is any individual’s fault. Many wealthy citizens have contributed to society and played by the rules. The problem is that the rules are often skewed in their favour. In other words, income inequality stems from systemic flaws. In our globalised world, inequality cannot be left to markets and local communities to solve any more than climate change can. As the consequences of rising domestic inequality feed through to geopolitics, eroding stability, the need to devise new rules, redistribution systems and even global agreements is no longer a matter of morals; increasingly, it is a matter of survival.     The writer, a former chief economist of the World Bank, is professor of economics at Cornell University. ©Project Syndicate, 2017. www.project-syndicate.org Rate up 3 users have voted.

Follow Kyle: Twitter | IG  May 16, 2017 Share Tweet Arkansas is not exactly what you would call a hotbed for hip-hop. The South's influence on the genre is undeniable, but that region's sound has been broadly defined by specific cities, like New Orleans, Atlanta, and Houston. That is, not Rogers, Arkansas. So Travis Scott bringing his Birds Eye View tour to the city was a big deal, both for people excited to attend and the less enthused locals who looked on skeptically. The distrustful locals were a central theme amongst people Complex spoke to about their experience at the show. Even before the concert took place, Rogers natives who attended the concert described an air of skepticism from a city not accustomed to hosting rap shows. "Seeing how it was the first rap show ever in this area, besides college parties, no one really knew what to expect," says John Stark, a resident of Rogers who says he has attended at least 10 shows at the Walmart Arkansas Music Pavilion​. "I just don't think the adult generation in our area was ready for a show like that... you mean to tell me Jim Bob with a Confederate flag Facebook banner complaining on a local news link knows a Travis Scott song?" As things started to heat up during his set, Scott invited fans to make one last push toward the pit if they wanted to get closer to the stage. Multiple people who spoke to Complex said he yelled at fans to take advantage of the opportunity and bypass security. "If you want to get to the pit this is your last chance," said Scott. "Fill the pit. Security, let them through! Security, let them through!" Travis Scott Fans - 1. Security - 0. pic.twitter.com/iTZPyDiRsR — LA FLAME FANPAGE 🎪 (@YamzInTheTrap) May 14, 2017 Rogers PD would later confirm this version of events, citing Scott's bypass of security in their statement on his arrest. "During the concert, [Scott] encouraged people to rush the stage and bypass the security protocols to ensure concert goer safety," said Rogers PD. "During the rush to the stage several people were injured, including an employee from the security company hired to help monitor and control the crowd, and a member of the police department. Though some fans claimed there was less chaos than you might have expected—Stark called it a "very controlled swarm"—others described disarray and people falling everywhere, struggling to get close enough to see the MC. "When Travis said it was our last chance to come down to the pit, it was literally like a mob of people," said Katie, an Arkansas native who attended the show. "Of course I was going to take my chance, so I ran down and I got pushed down so many times. I jumped the gate to get in, and saw so many people getting into fights. People were losing their shoes and everything." "It was like the scene in Lion King where Mufasa got trampled," added Michael Chen, a native of Fort Smith, Arkansas. In spite of warning signs about how the show was received locally—including Scott repeatedly thanking fire marshals and security in the middle of his set—people in attendance say they never expected Scott to end up being arrested, nor did most of them find out until the day after.  "When the show ended, it felt abrupt, and you could see some authority figure backstage motioning to him," says Chen. "I wouldn't say he looked rushed, but he sort of laughed it off when we kept telling him to repeat 'Goosebumps.' After the concert, there was a sense of, 'Damn, it's over?' and everyone was standing around for a good minute. There [were] people jokingly saying perhaps he got arrested, but I didn't find out until the morning." when travis scott gets kicked out of his own concert for making things too crazy, then gets arrested bc of it...😂 #FREELAFLAME @trvisXX pic.twitter.com/1zQCfG8HLk — Grace Ouellette (@ouellette_grace) May 14, 2017 None of the fans Complex spoke to about the concert had any regret or earnest concern about what went down. Some of them even took to social media after the event to share their sadness for concertgoers who didn't put in the effort to nudge their way toward the front of the concert. #FreeTravisScott can't believe they arrested him for being too lit. I feel bad for the people that didn't jump the gates🦅 @trvisXX pic.twitter.com/xLTJu5KBCi — katie🐏🐏 (@katieharmsxx) May 14, 2017 "I think the police overreacted a lot," said Katie. "The old people at the AMP just were dying seeing anyone have fun. So it looks like we're back to country music and bands no one has ever heard of." Travis Scott may not be invited back to Rogers in the near future, but one thing is certain—his fans are on his side, and they'd love to see him come back one day. "In no way at all was it anywhere near a riot," said Stark. "It was just a bunch of people having the best night of their lives." IM HEAR TO CAUSE A GOOD TIME.

Posted: Tuesday, May 16, 2017 Site plan calls for Culver’s between Taco Bell and Advanced Auto Parts By Cory Smith • Last Updated 11:11 am on Tuesday, May 16, 2017 Tweet Engineer Kyle Wilson of Nederveld in Grand Rapids, left, shows blueprints of a site plan for a new Culver’s restaurant to Greenville Planning Commission Chairman David Ralph, center, and Vice Chairman Greg Vandermark Thursday. — Daily News/Cory Smith GREENVILLE — In November of last year, Mike Brann Sr. and Mike Brann Jr. brought forth plans to construct a retail center on the edge of town, bringing with it a coffee shop and other potential businesses. While those plans sit in limbo as roadway access for the site — which sits in front of Wal-Mart — is debated, the Branns are moving forward with another potential investment on a separate site: a Culver’s Restaurant. During Thursday’s Greenville Planning Commission meeting, members of the Commission reviewed an application for a Planned Unit Development (PUD) site plan to construct the Culver’s between Taco Bell and Advanced Auto Parts at 1825 W. Washington Street (M-57). According to City Planner Tim Johnson of Main Street Planning, the site plan faces a few obstacles as it contrasts with the initial Youngman Center PUD that was established for that site in 2005. Greenville Planning Commission member Pete Frye, right, goes over details of the plan with City Planner Tim Johnson during Thursday. The entire site was 4.6 acres of vacant land fronting the south side of M-57 at the intersection of Youngman Road when established, and the approved PUD called for the eventual construction of four buildings. To date, only a Taco Bell restaurant has been built on the property, and for where the Culver’s has been proposed (a total site size of 1.39 acres), that area was originally designated for two buildings, one at 15,750 square feet, the other at 1,000 square feet. The current request, if approved, would essentially erase that design, as the Culver’s Restaurant would be 4,311 square feet with a drive-thru window on the western portion of the site — effectively displacing the two planned buildings from the 2005 PUD. According to Johnson, the Culver’s proposal has been determined to be a “major change” from the 2005 PUD, meaning the new PUD must be processed in the same manner as the original PUD application. In addressing the new site plan, Johnson and members of the Planning Commission brought forth two main concerns that would likely need to be addressed before any approval for the plan is given. Johnson said the building’s planned drive-thru lane would likely be problematic in that it exits onto the site’s existing service drive to the north, which immediately exits onto Youngman Road to the east. A proposed five parking spaces at the north end of the building and proximity of the drive-thru lane to Youngman Road raised concerns from the Commission. “As the plans exist as we have received them, is there even room at the drive-thru exit to turn completely, then waiting to make a left-hand turn (onto Youngman Road)?” Commission Chairman David Ralph asked. According to Johnson, the space would be about 15 feet, or “just barely enough for one car.” Ralph said he feared the situation could create a scenario where a car exiting the drive-thru would be sitting at a 45-degree angle to exit east onto Youngman Road. With traffic entering southbound from M-57 and potentially exiting westbound from Taco Bell, Ralph said he felt the situation would need to be addressed. “Unless they can make that turn and be squared up, I think we have a safety issue,” he said. Engineer Kyle Wilson of Nederveld in Grand Rapids, speaking on behalf of the Branns, said he would work with his clients to address the situation. Greenville City Manager George Bosanic suggested moving the entire building some distance to the west, if possible, to provide more buffer distance between the drive-thru lane and Youngman Road. “Personally I think that would be a good idea, you could add a little more value to the landscaped area, too,” he said. “It might look a little better than it looks like on paper.” In addressing the five parking spaces on the north end of the building, Wilson said that area could be instead turned into a possible outdoor seating area to prevent incoming traffic from the adjacent service drive. “Our goal is to get everything taken care of and back to you,” Wilson said. Commission member Dale Reyburn said he didn’t believe the drive-thru situation to be too problematic and was happy to see the plans come forward after complications have arisen with the Wal-Mart site. “It looks a lot better here than it would to the west of there (in front of Wal-Mart),” he said. “A Culver’s seems like it’s a good fit.” Members of the Planning Commission then voted unanimously to schedule a public hearing on June 8 to review the site plan and consider the major amendment to the PUD. If approved at that time, the Planning Commission would make a recommendation to Greenville City Council, which would make the final decision on the PUD site plan. While the Branns haven’t yet purchased the property in question, which is owned by Chicago Diversified Foods Corp. of Illinois, Mike Brann Jr. said he fully intends to buy it if the PUD application is approved. “Culver’s has 640 franchises open across the country,” he said. “But we haven’t purchased the property yet, not until we know we can build.” About the Author Cory Smith Cory is the Greenville beat reporter for The Daily News.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: 3 Digital Health Companies Poised for Sizzling Growth Why Wall Street thinks digital health companies Castlight Health, Evolent Health, and Tabula Rosa Healthcare could see huge earnings growth in the near future. Keith Speights (TMFFishBiz) May 16, 2017 at 3:02PM The digital health industry includes many Silicon Valley start-ups specializing in biomedical and medical solutions, mobile health, and virtual care. Some of the best and most promising companies, like Proteus Digital Health, aren't yet publicly traded, but these three stocks could be especially promising investing options. Company Ticker Market Cap Estimated 5-Year Earnings Growth Castlight Health CSLT $535 million 30% Evolent Health EVH $1.71 billion 30% Tabula Rosa Healthcare TRHC $218 million 49% Data source: Yahoo! Finance. Why do Wall Street analysts have such great expectations for Castlight Health (NYSE:CSLT), Evolent Health (NYSE:EVH), and Tabula Rasa Healthcare (NASDAQ:TRHC)? Here's why these three digital health companies appear to be poised for sizzling growth over the next few years. Image source: Getty Images. Castlight Health: Reducing inefficiencies in healthcare spending Castlight provides a health benefits platform that helps employees make better health decisions, and enables employers to communicate and measure their benefit programs. The company combines big data analytics, software and services delivery models, and consumer-oriented web and mobile products with the goal of reducing waste and inefficiencies in employers' healthcare spending. Although Castlight isn't yet profitable, its revenue and gross profit have grown quickly after its initial public offering (IPO) in 2014. Castlight is on track to be breakeven on a cash flow basis by the end of 2018. That projection includes the impact of the company's acquisition earlier this year of Jiff, which markets an enterprise benefits platform that allows employees to choose from over 50 pre-integrated services. Castlight's growth strategy relies on being able to improve several key problems that current result in poor health decisions and over-spending for healthcare. Its research has found that 73% of employees don't fully understand their health benefits, and that employees can sometimes pay up to 10 times more than other employees for the same service. The company has already attracted more than 240 employers as customers, including Walmart.  Evolent Health: Providing tools for the shift to value-based healthcare Evolent Health completed its IPO in 2015 but was founded in 2011. The company is a pioneer in using digital health technologies to enable health systems to succeed in value-based payment models. Evolent's products include technology platforms for managing care workflows, patient engagement, population health, and financials.  The company's adjusted revenue has grown at a compounded annual growth rate of 138% over the last five years. Evolent made several strategic acquisitions last year that should drive revenue even higher. The largest of these acquisitions was the purchase in October 2016 of Valence Health, which provides value-based administration, population health, and advisory services.  Evolent's bottom line is improving as the company grows revenue. That growth should continue thanks to a continued transformation of the nation's healthcare system from a fee-for-service model to an outcomes-based, value-based payment model.    Tabula Rasa Healthcare: Picking up the PACE Tabula Rasa Healthcare is a healthcare technology company focused on decreasing medication-related risk, reducing adverse drug events, enhancing compliance and quality of care, and improving medication outcomes. The company was founded in 2011 and completed its IPO in October 2016. Like Castlight and Evolent, Tabula Rasa isn't profitable, but it is on the right track. Its revenue grew 94% from 2014 to 2016. The company's adjusted EBITDA soared 359% during the same period. By the end of 2016, Tabula Rasa claimed 133 customers focused on populations with complex healthcare needs and extensive medication requirements. These customers include healthcare organizations, Medicare managed care plans, self-insured employers, and post-acute care providers. Tabula Rasa Healthcare's growth strategy consists of three core initiatives. The company intends to attract new customers in its current largest market, Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE). PACE is a Medicare/Medicaid program that provides medical and social services to elderly individuals. Tabula Rasa is also looking for strategic acquisitions that would allow it to enter new markets, and it is continuing to develop new technologies and services.

Like The Denton Record-Chronicle's Facebook Page Students head to West Coast to learn about retail and digital companies  Nine UNT students will get to tour Google, Facebook and Amazon headquarters this month as part of a "Digital Study Tour" class.  The five-day trip across the West Coast will be led by Linda Mihalick, a lecturer who is teaching the class this summer semester.  "The point is to dream bigger, to open their eyes and to give them the experience of what it might be like to work in ecommerce and digital environments," she said in a press release. The students will also visit  Macy's, Nordstrom, Walmart and Nike headquarters.  Research begins this summer on how trees interact with black carbon Professor Alexandra Ponette-Gonzalez and a team of researchers will measure how trees in Denton work as "urban air filters" for a National Science Foundation grant.  The grant was awarded this year, and now they're ready for the research. Throughout the summer, the team will look at what pollutants are captured by post oak and live oak trees across Denton. They'll look at how much carbon from leaves, the urban air filters, washes off with rain.  By studying this, they'll see where trees are most effective at capturing black carbon and other pollutants.  Professors to research, then host conference with NSF grant  Three UNT professors will research how political conflict can impact language and culture, then host a conference in fall 2018 to discuss their work.  Shobhana Chelliah, a professor in the Department of Linguistics, is collaborating with James Meernik and Kimi King from the Department of Political Science for the project.  They hope the conference will be further reaching than just their research. They want a variety of linguists and political scientists to work together to better understand how the politics of language and civil war are related.  The National Science Foundation is funding the study and conference with a $42,515 grant.

And mobile companies know how much North Americans love hitting the highways, discovering roadside attractions, dining at legendary hole-in-the-wall diners and making it to their final destinations without missing an adventure along the way. It's common to feel inclined to go off the grid while traveling with your family or friends on the open road, but many road travelers don't know just how helpful their smartphones can be. The app store is loaded with applications designed to help you locate the cheapest gas prices, find a cozy (and affordable) hotel at the last minute and discover eateries and attractions that far surpass McDonald's or a local Wal-Mart. These three lesser-known, must-have road trip apps are guaranteed to change the way you travel this spring and summer. ParkMe Photo credit: (vincent desjardins) It's easy to focus on routes, hotel reservations and attractions when planning a cross-country road trip, but many road warriors forget about a key element of traveling by car -- it needs to be parked somewhere. ParkMe is a free app that offers the world's most accurate parking database, spanning 84,000 locations in 64 countries. Whether you're searching for cheap garage parking in Vancouver or a free place to park on the street outside your hotel in St. John's, this app will become a go-to every time you hit the road. ParkMe is able to let you know how many spaces are left in a parking garage or on a street and will warn you when your meter or time limit is running low. You can even pay for a parking space ahead of time by credit card, so you're guaranteed a space upon arrival. Want to have your car washed while you're resting in the room? This must-have road trip app can help you with that too. Roadtrippers Photo credit: Kevin Dooley Just as the name implies, Roadtrippers is the ultimate road trip app. In fact, it's the nation's fastest growing mobile and web travel planning platform. More than 5.5 million trips have been planned and booked on Roadtrippers to date, and you're about to add to that list. The goal of the app is to introduce travelers to off-the-beaten-path places along their journey, helping them create unique, lasting memories that they wouldn't have experienced otherwise. Roadtrippers offers a step-by-step trip planning platform that makes planning your route, booking accommodations and discovering local gems along the journey easier than ever before. This app is the only place on the web where a traveler can easily plan, book, discover, and navigate throughout a trip on his or her mobile device. Whether you're seeking a family museum, lesser-known national park or an unforgettable slice of pizza, Roadtrippers will help turn a typical road trip into an extraordinary one. Flush Toilet Finder Photo credit: Phillip Pessar You're probably assuming rest stops will have you covered, but avid road trippers know how important finding clean restrooms on the road can be. Flush Toilet Finder is the easiest way to find a public restroom when you're in a pinch. This free app, with no in-app purchases, provides more than 190,000 bathrooms in a database that spans Canada, the U.S., and a long list of other countries around the world. Flush Toilet Finder informs travelers of which wash rooms offer disabled access, require fees for use or involve grabbing a key from an attendant. Toilets can be rated and reported, making it easy for weary travelers to find sanitary stops. This is the road trip, and general travel, app you didn't know you needed.

Apr 10, 2017 Part 3: Development and Leasing Outlook Apr 10, 2017 2017 Top Office Owners Apr 10, 2017 NREI WIRE brought to you by Retail Retail CEOs Renew Border-Tax Fight at Meeting With Mnuchin The 10-person group that’s meeting with Mnuchin includes chief executive officers from both retail and consumer-product companies, according to Brian Dodge, senior executive vice president for public affairs for the Retail Industry Leaders Association. Bloomberg | May 16, 2017 (Bloomberg) — After months of uncertainty about a border-adjusted tax, retail CEOs are renewing efforts to quash the idea. Executives are planning to host a meeting with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Tuesday to reinforce their opposition to the tax policy, which is a centerpiece of House Speaker Paul Ryan’s agenda. Ryan’s plan would replace the existing corporate income tax with a 20 percent levy on U.S. companies’ domestic sales and imports. Exports would be excluded. The 10-person group that’s meeting with Mnuchin includes chief executive officers from both retail and consumer-product companies, according to Brian Dodge, senior executive vice president for public affairs for the Retail Industry Leaders Association. The lineup includes department-store chain J.C. Penney Co., apparel maker VF Corp. and battery producer Energizer Holdings Inc., he said. Retail CEOs took the fight to derail border adjustment directly to President Donald Trump during a February meeting at the White House. The president didn’t include the concept in a one-page outline of a tax plan that the White House released last month, and Senate Republicans have been very cool to the measure, which critics say would hit consumers with higher prices. Supporters’ Case Industrial companies and other exporters, meanwhile, generally like the idea. They say it would boost investment in the U.S. and is the best path to a broader tax overhaul. Its allies also include Bill Simon, the former chief of Wal-Mart Stores Inc.’s U.S. operations. He said the retail industry’s opposition to BAT was “self-serving and hysterical” in an interview Monday on Bloomberg Television. Simon, who left the world’s biggest retailer in 2014 and is now a senior adviser at Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., said a phase-in period of between three and five years for the tax would be reasonable to giving chains time to react. “Prices may go up, but that’s not a guarantee,” Simon said. “Good retailers will respond to the new rules.” Orrin Hatch, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said earlier this month that Mnuchin and White House economic adviser Gary Cohn were opposed to the border-adjusted tax. House Support Despite the resistance, Ryan and his ally Kevin Brady, the Republican chairman of the House Ways and Means committee that oversees tax legislation, remain committed to it. Brady has acknowledged that the measure may need to be revised in order to make its way into final legislation. Border adjustment is seen as key to the House leaders’ blueprint for tax reform because it raises the revenue to help pay for cutting the corporate tax rate. Having a revenue-neutral plan would help ensure that any tax changes would be permanent. Because GOP leaders don’t foresee winning any Democratic votes in the Senate, they plan to use a procedure that requires only a simple majority. That procedure requires that any legislative changes that add to the deficit outside a 10-year budget window must be set to expire. Other CEOs scheduled to attend are from AutoZone Inc., Chico’s FAS Inc., Dollar General Corp., Ikea North America Services, PetSmart Inc., Tractor Supply co. and PVH Corp.   With assistance from Matthew Boyle.

Follow @UPROXX Follow UPROXX Member Sign Up Sign In Tracy Morgan’s New Netflix Special, ‘Staying Alive’ Proves He’ll Never Lose His Sense Of Humor Andrew Husband News & Entertainment Writer 05.16.17 Facebook Twitter EMAIL Netflix The Tracy Morgan I saw at Boston’s Wilbur Theatre on February 21st, 2016 — three weeks into his Picking Up the Pieces tour — is a far cry from the man who dances onto the stage in Staying Alive. Announced in early 2017, Morgan’s new Netflix special adds his name to an impressive roster of stand-up comedians who signed on with the streaming giant to distribute their latest concert films. Yet unlike Amy Schumer, Dave Chappelle and Louis C.K., the Saturday Night Live and 30 Rock alum’s contribution stands on its own. Not so much because it’s funnier or better looking, but because Morgan is literally standing. One of the most jarring aspects of seeing Morgan perform live then was knowing that, 16 months prior, he was nearly killed in a devastating car accident involving a Walmart truck. (The June 2014 incident on the New Jersey Turnpike killed comedian James “Jimmy Mack” McNair and left Morgan in critical condition.) That’s especially true since, due to his ongoing physical and mental recovery, the comic delivered his material at a noticeably slower pace. The atypically soft-spoken Morgan also made greater use of a large chair located center stage that, though similar to the one seen in 2014’s Bona Fide, he almost immediately sat down in. This is not at all the case in Staying Alive, which begins with a parody of the iconic opening scene from 1977’s Saturday Night Fever. Dressed like John Travolta’s Tony Manero, Morgan struts his stuff through Brooklyn while carrying a recognizably blue Walmart shopping bag. After a few visual gags the short bit gives way to the special, in which Morgan doesn’t beeline for the chair like he did at the Wilbur. Instead he dances onto the stage, delves right into a brief screed about the accident (“Everybody here knows I got hit by that f*ckin’ Walmart truck!”), and jokes about being kicked out of heaven by God — while standing. Six minutes into the routine, Morgan seemingly accepts his newfound physical limitations and sits in the chair, but it’s not what you think. For the remarkably active performer is using the chair not so much as a place of rest, but as a prop. Recalling the first days after he came out of his coma, when the doctors explained the extent of his injuries, Morgan jokes: “I asked my doctor, ‘Is my dick okay? I don’t need no thigh bone. I need my dick!'” Miming his response had they told him the worst, Morgan sits in the chair for the first time and continues: “Well I’m going back into this coma, mother f*cker!” Share This Facebook Twitter EMAIL Around The Web TAGScomedyNETFLIXreviewsSTAND-UPstreamingtracy morgan Join The Discussion: Log In With Sign In With Facebook Sign In With Twitter Sign In With Email Profile By: Andrew Husband 05.16.2017 @ 3:01 AM "Tracy Morgan’s New Netflix Special, ‘Staying Alive’ Proves He’ll Never Lose His Sense Of Humor" Cancel reply View all comments Innovative Minds Meet The Young CEO Who’s Taking On Apple In The Smart Earbud Race Allison Sanchez 05.10.17 7 days ago This Teen’s Simple Device Could Revolutionize Travel Safety Allison Sanchez 05.09.17 1 week ago 4 Comments These Revolutionary Programs Are Helping Native American Kids Chase Careers In Science, Technology, And Engineering Zach Johnston 05.05.17 2 weeks ago 2 Comments Meet The Food Lab Using Science To Understand The Joys Of Eating Mark Shrayber 05.04.17 2 weeks ago This ‘Drone Camp’ Is Inspiring Kids To Learn About STEM Steve Bramucci 05.03.17 2 weeks ago How Drone Technology Is Helping Us Better Understand The Animal Kingdom Christian Long 05.03.17 2 weeks ago UPROXX Job at Uproxx Contact Advertising About UPROXX Privacy Policy Staff Powered by WordPress.com VIP

Don’t Bet on It. Target's comeback initiatives keep running into walls. TGT stock is due for another post-earnings dip on Wednesday. May 16, 2017, 1:38 pm EDT  |  By Don Dion, InvestorPlace Contributor Get AMZN alerts: Submit     View All   The retail industry has been in steep decline, and Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) is no exception. Retailers have been closing stores and laying off employees as a way to cut costs and transition greater focus to online resources. Target has particularly struggled with the increase in online shopping and competition with Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and TGT stock has suffered as a response — down more than 20% year-to-date alone. Source: Shutterstock The company reports first-quarter earnings on May 17, and we predict further downside in Target stock. Amazon and Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE:WMT) are increasingly stealing market share in the e-commerce space, and Target appears to be left behind in the dust. On Feb. 28, Target reported highly disappointing fourth-quarter results, and TGT shares dropped nearly 13% in response. Holiday expectations fell short. Margins came under pressure, with gross margin dropping to 26.9% (100 bps from last year) and EBIDTA margin down to 9.5% (30 bps drop). Target also lowered guidance for 2017. TGT is expected to report first-quarter earnings before the bell on Wednesday, May 17. Analysts are expecting earnings of 91 cents per share and have a quarterly revenue target of $15.6 billion. However, given indicators of recent performance, we expect Target earnings to be similarly disappointing as its prior results, and we expect TGT stock to continue its 2017 slide. Target’s New Concept Stores Are a Flop After reporting its disappointing Q4 results, Target announced plans to spend $7 billion over the next three years on improving its e-commerce presence and redesigning its stores. The objective was to remodel 100 stores in 2017, 250 in 2018, and 250 in 2019. The purpose of the new store format was to make it easier for customers who were in a rush as well as appeal to those who like to browse. In October 2017, Houston will be home to TGT’s first fully redesigned store that will include two separate entrances: one for customers who want to browse beauty or fashion, and another for time-crunched shoppers. The latter will also lead customers to the store’s redesigned grocery aisle, which will include grab-and-go products, as well as self-checkout lanes, a wine and beer shop and a counter dedicated solely to picking up online orders. According to Chief Executive Officer Brian Cornell, the revitalization plans will increase sales by 2%-4% in each location. However, the new concept stores don’t seem to be off to a good start. Chief Innovation and Strategy Officer Casey Carl, who was leading the new concept stores, announced he was leaving the company in April. His departure comes shortly after Target canceled the launch of its “store of the future” which was expected to open in Silicon Valley and offered innovative and futuristic features. Carl, who has been with the company for nearly 20 years, was overseeing that project, among others. With the update of old stores, TGT also announced plans to expand its smaller format stores in urban environments, which currently comprises 32 of their 1,800 stores. Comparable-store sales are nearly double at the smaller format stores in urban settings compared to their bigger locations in suburban settings. The goal is to quadruple their small-format stores in urban areas by 2019. We are cautious on the idea of opening new stores at time when Target’s store sales are falling and most retailers are closing shops. Executive Departures and Pay Cuts Casey Carl is just one of many in the long list of executive-level departures that have hampered TGT stock over the past year. The head of human resources, grocery, digital and marketing, among others, have also left as pressure from falling sales continues to mount. With Target struggling with its financial performance and launching new initiative these executive departures could not have happened at a worse time. Those remaining with the company have faced cuts to pay and bonuses. Cornell received no bonus from the company and a one-third paycut. Chief Financial Officer Cathy Smith saw her compensation for 2016 fall by 41.3% to $4.4 million, and Chief Operating Officer John Mulligan’s compensation fell by 32.7% to $7 million. These significant pay cuts highlight the dire situation Target is in.

The Commerce Department said today that retail sales increased 0.4 percent in April from March. Sales ticked up just 0.1 percent in March and fell in February. The increase suggests that consumers are poised to spur faster growth in the April-June quarter after the economy barely expanded in the first three months of the year. Consumer spending — which also includes spending on services such as utilities — rose at its slowest pace in more than seven years in the first quarter. Window shoppers look into a store on Miami Beach, Florida's Lincoln Road. ASSOCIATED PRESS Enlarge The rise also indicates that the struggles of large retail chains, such as Macy’s and JC Penney’s, reflect changes in consumer buying patterns more than broader economic weakness. Sales in a category that includes department stores, as well as general retailers such as Wal-Mart, fell 0.5 percent in April, the government said. Yet a category that includes online retailers reported sales growth of 1.4 percent, the strongest of any group. “The retail sales data provide further reason to expect that overall consumption growth will be much stronger in the second quarter,” said Andrew Hunter, U.S. economist at Capital Economics. The sales gains were widespread, as Americans spent more at electronics and appliance stores, health care retailers, and sporting goods outlets. Sales fell at grocery stores and clothing merchants. Americans ate out more, boosting spending at restaurants and bars 0.4 percent. Auto sales rose 0.7 percent after falling in March. Consumer confidence has soared since the presidential election, but spending hasn’t increased as much as the jump in optimism would suggest. Last month’s gain in retail sales was solid but not particularly strong. Hiring has been steady and the unemployment rate fell to a ten-year low of 4.4 percent in April. Yet average hourly pay rose just 2.5 percent over the past year. And inflation has ticked up, eroding most of that wage gain. In a separate report, the Labor Department said consumer prices increased 2.2 percent in the past year. The slowdown in consumer spending over the winter added to the woes of many retailers. On Wednesday Macy’s reported sharply lower sales and profits, causing a collapse in its share price. Brick-and-mortar retailers are suffering through their worst patch since the Great Recession. More than twice as many stores have closed this year than at the same point last year. Bankruptcies are far outpacing last year’s rate. Retailers slashed jobs at the sharpest pace in seven years this spring. And retailers collectively could report the biggest drop in first-quarter profits since 2009.

TGT stock is dropping fast amid declining sales By Chris Fraley, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  May 16, 2017, 10:41 am EDT     Popular Posts: Why Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Can Survive With Fewer Ads Will Target Corporation (TGT) Stock Survive the New Retail Reality? Recent Posts: Will Target Corporation (TGT) Stock Survive the New Retail Reality? Why Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Can Survive With Fewer Ads Don’t Bottom-Fish Fitbit Inc (FIT) Stock After Earnings View All Posts Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) is one of the great retail success stories of the 21st century. But the industry is passing it by, and TGT stock is fading fast. Can tomorrow’s earnings report right the ship? Source: Shutterstock Perhaps … at least for a little while. Expectations are low: Analysts anticipate a 29% decline in earnings-per-share and a 3.5% sales decrease. Sadly, those would represent improvements over the previous quarter. So the bar is low. If Target earnings come in higher, it will be deemed a victory. But until TGT stock starts demonstrating real, sustained growth again, the company projects the appearance of a retail has-been. Can TGT Stock Recover? That’s an odd thing to say about the sixth-largest brick-and-mortar retailer in America. But remember, Target firmly held the No. 2 spot behind Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE:WMT) for years, and was once deemed the only real threat to the king of the retail world. After more than a decade of steady growth, Target stock topped $70 billion in sales for the first time ever in 2012, reaching $73 billion. It hasn’t been higher than $73 billion since, dipping below $70 billion last year. The company’s sales have now declined for five straight quarters, with a sixth in a row expected. As Target has regressed, so too has TGT stock. The company has lost roughly a quarter of its value in the last year, including big nosedives in January and February. Target stock hasn’t traded above its 50-day moving average all year. Given that ugly backdrop, I think it’s time to ask the uncomfortable question — one that’s especially uncomfortable if you still have TGT stock in your portfolio. Is Target on its way to becoming extinct? Department stores like Sears Holdings Corp (NASDAQ:SHLD), J C Penney Company Inc (NYSE:JCP) and Macy’s Inc (NYSE:M) have essentially been declared dead for years. Lesser big-box stores have also fallen by the wayside. Is Target — revered and affectionately called “Tar-jay” in its heyday, which wasn’t long ago — the next victim? Have Jeff Bezos and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) officially swallowed it whole too? It’s too early to go that far. But it’s at least fair to wonder if TGT will ever get back to consistent growth again. By extension, it may take a while for Target stock to reclaim its $82-peak, established little more than a year ago. There’s a chance it may never get back there. Target Stock Is Not a True Bargain Trading at just 11 times earnings, it’s easy to get sucked into a value trap with this stock. But TGT stock is cheap for a reason: earnings aren’t growing and the stock has been falling for a full year. And that’s why I would recommend avoiding Target stock, even if it handily beats earnings on Wednesday. In an era where online retailers are laying waste to malls, department stores and big-box stores across America, the only brick-and-mortar stores still thriving are the extremely high-end (think Tiffany & Co. (NYSE:TIF)) or the deep discounters (think Five Below Inc (NASDAQ:FIVE) and Dollar Tree, Inc. (NASDAQ:DLTR)). Target is caught somewhere in between. And right now, that might as well be purgatory. As of this writing, Chris Fraley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 16 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Encouraging News & Opinion Coming Out of Ceres Gathering in San Francisco — Progress in Corporate Sustainability Continuing! G&A’s Sustainability Highlights (11.05.2017) SOURCE: Governance & Accountability Institute, Inc. DESCRIPTION: Water scarcity, resource depletion, climate change impacts… these were top-of-the-agenda items at the annual Ceres Conference convened last week in San Francisco.  These of course are pressing challenges for the domestic and global business communities, for investors and various stakeholders.  While there are many aspects to these issues to consider, the takeaway from the conference, writes Aaron Pickering, is that the focus on sustainability is good business (and good for business). Among the key issues and topics in the Ceres dialogue:  the role of clean-energy in driving economic growth.  Clean energy creates jobs — lots of them.  Clean energy power — think renewables — making for cheaper consumption than traditional fossil fuels in many parts of the word.  (A study by Ceres, WWF, CDP and Calvert indicated that Fortune 500 companies saved almost US$3.7 billion through their climate and energy commitments in 2016. That is good for business — and many stakeholders!)  Cheers to Walmart Stores, General Motors, Bank of America, Google, Apple, and Facebook — these are among F-500 companies that have set or are setting definitive science-based goals — and (23) are setting practices in place to power 100 percent of their operations with renewables.  IBM is working toward the 2020 renewable energy goal the company has set, with more than 3,000 energy conservation programs in place; in 2015, the company saved $30 million and avoided emissions of 250,000 metric tons.  Lots of good news coming out of the very popular Ceres gathering in San Francisco, welcome indeed in contrast to some of the news coming out of the nation’s capital as the Trump forces and members of the Congress look to dismantle vital parts of the Obama Administration environmental and energy-saving policies.   Tune in to the Top Story by Aaron Pickering (VP of Cone Communications; Ceres is a client of his company). And there is much more encouraging news in the selections for you  in this week’s newsletter by our Editor-in-Chief Ken Cynar and the G&A Team.  The forces arrayed against the foes of U.S. environmental protection, clean energy and greater sustainability policies are broad-based and influential. This is just the introduction of G&A’s Sustainability Highlights newsletter this week. Click here to view the full issue.

News Sports Entertainment Opinion Obituaries E-Edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds Member Rewards log in Site Site Archive Nick in the AM: 'Walmart sucks,' but is retail dying? Tuesday May 16, 2017 at 10:00 AM May 16, 2017 at 11:43 AM Nick Vlahos Journal Star reporter @vlahosnick Good morning, troops. It's Tuesday, May 16. Last week, Nick in the Morning visited Canton to check on the progress that city is making after a natural-gas explosion last November caused extensive downtown damage. Indeed, things are better there now than in the immediate aftermath of the explosion. At least they appear better for locally based, independent merchants who fill niches. The biggest general retailer downtown, J.C. Penney, is in the process of liquidating. It's supposed to close at the end of July. The Penney closing is part of about 140 taking place nationwide, where things have been tough on retail. In the immediate Peoria area this year, the MC Sports outlet in East Peoria has closed. Gordmans outlets in East Peoria and Peoria remain open, although about half its locations are to close after another retailer received company assets in a bankruptcy auction. Gander Mountain, which has an outlet in Peoria, is undergoing the same process. No less an expert than the Oracle of Omaha says retail as we know it is dying, replaced by online shopping. Warren Buffett's corporation, Berkshire Hathaway, recently sold almost all its Walmart stock. Other soothsayers aren't so sure retail is meeting its demise. Some of the people we talked with last week in Canton seem to concur more with Buffett's analysis. "What we're seeing in general is all the brick-and-mortar stores closing," Industry resident Stephanie McMillan said as she stood outside J.C. Penney. "In general, I think it's terrible. It's too bad, because there's no place to shop anymore." McMillan noted the closing of the Penney store in Macomb, which is located about 12 miles north of her hometown. A regional chain of greeting-card stores, Kirlin's Hallmark, recently closed its outlet on the downtown Macomb square. "Quincy and Peoria is all that we have," McMillan said in reference to shopping malls in those cities. Soon, there might not be such an option in Galesburg. Stores are departing Sandburg Mall in that city, following uncertainty about the facility's future. Demolition plans for at least part of the mall had been announced, but those appear to be on hold. "When that opened in the early '70s, that was the place to be and where all the kids wanted to be," Galesburg resident Donna Hoffman said. "You wanted to talk about that Monday, when you went to school. It was a really big deal." Hoffman and her husband, Don, were shopping in downtown Canton for the first time. Both said they were impressed. They called the area beautiful and said it appeared prosperous. But the Hoffmans and McMillan were somewhat sheepish in admitting they do some shopping online, although they try to avoid it. They cited convenience and time-saving aspects. "People don't have to get off their rear ends," McMillan said. Said Donna Hoffman: "Time is the most valuable asset that we have these days." Time is running out for the Penney store in Canton, albeit perhaps not for dime stores and other downtown merchants. That's no mean feat, considering how many Canton retailers lost explosion-related business in the pre-Christmas period, which is a crucial one. All of it beats the mega-retailers, in at least one opinion. "Everything's Walmart," McMillan said. "Walmart sucks." What doesn't suck is the song heard on the way into work. And for those who compare Blood, Sweat & Tears to Chicago, because they both feature a horn section, please note BS&T is a jazz band with a rock influence. Chicago is a rock band with a jazz influence.

A typical can of tuna today costs about $1.50 and the U.S. Department of Justice says that price may be the result of price fixing by Thai, South Korean and U.S. seafood dealers, while major retailers are suing alleging they've been ripped off. The U.S. government began investigating criminal price fixing between the three companies more than two years ago. Together the companies supply about 80 percent of the $1.7 billion of canned tuna sold annually in the United States, according to the court records. Following up, Walmart and other top retailers filed civil lawsuits. Those cases were updated this week with an appendix first reported by Undercurrent News that singles out dozens of tuna executives, roping in some of the wealthiest businessmen in Thailand, where Chicken of the Sea's parent company Thai Union is based. "Thai Union does not comment on ongoing legal matters," the company said in a statement. The other firms did not respond immediately for requests for comment. The litigation describes regular telephone calls and meetings where "executives agreed that all three companies would collective raise prices." They also agreed to "limit promotions and packaged tuna that undercut their published pricing," according to court records. Thai Union's president and CEO Thiraphong Chansiri, his father Kraisorn Chansiri and dozens of other Thai and American executives are now identified specifically in the ongoing case. Thai Union owns Chicken of the Sea, Red Lobster and U.S. Pet Nutrition, among other companies. In-Gu Park, acting president of South Korea-based Dongwon Enterprise, which owns StarKist, and Chris Lischewski, president and CEO of San Diego-based BumbleBee also were named in the court records. Although fewer Americans eat tuna every year, it's still a mainstay in most kitchens and the country's favorite type of fish. Canned tuna was popularized during World War 1, when it was a convenient protein for troops who returned home and continued to ask for it. Last week in the criminal case in San Francisco, Bumble Bee Foods said it would plead guilty to a felony charge of conspiring to fix the prices of canned and pouched tuna, and pay a $25 million fine. The announcement came after two Bumble Bee executives, senior vice-presidents Ken Worsham and Walter Scott Cameron, also pleaded guilty. They agreed to cooperate with authorities in the ongoing investigation, and face jail time and fines. The FBI and Justice Department said their investigation into packaged seafood is aimed at protecting consumers who deserve competitive prices. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

It was during that meeting, officials said, that Trump went off script and began describing details of an Islamic State terrorist threat related to the use of laptop computers on aircraft.” Story Continued Below — “Trump also described measures the United States has taken or is contemplating to counter the threat, including military operations in Iraq and Syria, as well as other steps to tighten security, officials said. The officials would not discuss details of those measures, but the Department of Homeland Security recently disclosed that it is considering banning laptops and other large electronic devices from carry-on bags on flights between Europe and the United States.” — “The White House went into fresh damage control mode on Monday, pushing back against a Washington Post report that Trump revealed highly classified information to the Russian foreign minister and ambassador last week, the latest scandal to engulf the embattled White House,” POLITICO reports. “The story that came out tonight as reported is false,” national security adviser H.R. McMaster said. POLITICO’s Bryan Bender also has reactions from intelligence experts and former government security officials of both parties, who note that Trump’s allegedly loose lips with the Russians could have caused serious damage to U.S. efforts to counter the Islamic State. USPTO DIRECTOR TAKES THE STAGE AT GW — Patent Office boss Michelle Lee is the keynote speaker at this morning's Intellectual Property Law Symposium at the George Washington University Law School. What MT's looking for: If Lee shares preliminary results from her review of the functioning of the controversial Patent Trial and Appeal Board – like data on how often issued patents are finding themselves poked and prodded by the court's judges. Lee kicked off the PTAB review last month, and the Foggy Bottom session’s an early opportunity for others in the patent world to hear how it's going. Here's the day's agenda. IA’S WISH LIST FOR LIGHTHIZER — The Internet Association, which counts Facebook, Google and Twitter among its members, is outlining its priorities to newly minted U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer. Topping the list: more detailed guidelines for cross-border data flows and increased flexibility around data localization restrictions. The group says there’s also a need for a chief digital trade negotiator or other senior official to serve as a point person overseeing this specific policy area. “Staff at USTR currently dedicated to addressing barriers to digital trade is not commensurate with the importance of our sector to the overall U.S. economy,” IA writes.

WHITE HOUSE’S APPLE SHOUT-OUT — Press Secretary Sean Spicer on Monday highlighted recent investments from companies like Intel and Apple as a sign of broader “optimism” resulting from the economic policies of the Trump administration. “The president is also glad to see businesses once again making significant investments in America,” Spicer said. “From Intel to General Motors to Walmart to Apple — who specifically just announced earlier this month they will start a $1 billion fund to promote advanced manufacturing jobs here in the United States.” Apple awarded the first $200 million from this fund to Corning Glass last Friday. ** A message from Qualcomm: The smartphone revolution didn’t happen by accident.

The ruling is a blow to Uber as it battles with Google to lead the self-driving car race. U.S. District Judge William Alsup wrote that Uber knew--or should have known--that Levandowski, who used to work for Waymo, had taken files possibly containing trade secrets and that Waymo intellectual property “seeped into” Uber’s self-driving project. — Snap back: Snap shares were trading higher on Monday after big-name funds including Fidelity Management and Research, Coatue Management and Jennison revealed the size of their stakes in the company, Bloomberg reports. The company saw significant declines in share price following a disappointing earnings call last week that revealed underwhelming user growth and significant revenue losses. — Gates’ graduation advice: In a tweetstorm of advice he shared for recent college graduates, Microsoft founder Bill Gates emphasized the need to learn about and tackle inequality at an early age, Recode reports. “AI, energy, and biosciences are promising fields where you can make a huge impact. It's what I would do if starting out today,” he wrote. “You can start fighting inequity, whether down the street or around the world, sooner.” As of Monday afternoon, “The Better Angels of Our Nature,” a book Gates recommended for graduates, had surged 6,000 percent in the sales rankings on Amazon compared to the previous 24 hours, The Washington Post reports. MEANWHILE, IN EUROPE — — May’s Facebook Live fail: U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May participated in her first Facebook Live Q&A and things didn’t exactly go as planned, The Daily Beast reports. The video feed was bombarded with angry emoji and questions, and her opponent Jeremy Corbyn even chimed into the comments and called May out for refusing to debate him. The U.K. general election is set for early June. CEI MAKES CASE FOR NET NEUTRALITY ROLLBACK — The Competitive Enterprise Institute, in a report out this morning, argues that the current net neutrality rules hurt broadband investment and reduce innovation. “The FCC’s net neutrality rules are the opposite of what American consumers want and need online and there is little evidence of the harms these regulations claim to prevent,” CEI Research Fellow and Regulatory Counsel Ryan Radia writes. “If the FCC rule is left intact, it will prevent you from getting free stuff like sponsored data from your wireless provider. Just think, if you like unlimited HBO with your AT&T plan or unlimited music streaming from T-Mobile, then you should demand that these net neutrality regulations be eliminated.” TRANSITIONS — Lyndon Rive, founder of SolarCity, is leaving Tesla, per Reuters.

Major retailers are taking aim at the most popular tuna brands in the U.S. - Chicken of the Sea, Bumble Bee and StarKist - saying they conspired to keep prices high for consumers. (Caleb Jones/Associated Press) Related Stories Atlantic bluefin tuna not listed as an endangered species Fishy labels?: Ottawa considering steps to provide more detail on seafood labels Fish still healthy, but study suggests species with more mercury may be linked to ALS Canadian seafood industry braces for new U.S. traceability rules Executives of the most popular tuna brands in the U.S. — Chicken of the Sea, Bumble Bee and StarKist — conspired regularly to keep prices high for consumers with a taste for one of America's favourite sandwich ingredients, according to criminal and civil court records updated this week. A typical can of tuna today costs about $1.50 US and the U.S. Department of Justice says that price may be the result of price fixing by Thai, South Korean and U.S. seafood dealers, while major retailers are suing alleging they've been ripped off. The U.S. government began investigating criminal price fixing between the three companies more than two years ago. Together the companies supply about 80 per cent of the $1.7 billion US of canned tuna sold annually in the United States, according to the court records. Civil lawsuits by major retailers Following up, Walmart and other top retailers filed civil lawsuits. Those cases were updated this week with an appendix first reported by Undercurrent News that singles out dozens of tuna executives, roping in some of the wealthiest businessmen in Thailand, where Chicken of the Sea's parent company Thai Union is based. "Thai Union does not comment on ongoing legal matters," the company said in a statement. The other firms did not respond immediately for requests for comment. The litigation describes regular telephone calls and meetings where "executives agreed that all three companies would collective raise prices." They also agreed to "limit promotions and packaged tuna that undercut their published pricing," according to court records. Thai Union's president and CEO Thiraphong Chansiri, his father Kraisorn Chansiri and dozens of other Thai and American executives are now identified specifically in the ongoing case. Thai Union owns Chicken of the Sea, Red Lobster and U.S. Pet Nutrition, among other companies. In-Gu Park, acting president of South Korea-based Dongwon Enterprise, which owns StarKist, and Chris Lischewski, president and CEO of San Diego-based BumbleBee also were named in the court records. Tuna still popular with Americans Although fewer Americans eat tuna every year, it's still a mainstay in most kitchens and the country's favourite type of fish. Canned tuna was popularized during World War 1, when it was a convenient protein for troops who returned home and continued to ask for it. Last week in the criminal case in San Francisco, Bumble Bee Foods said it would plead guilty to a felony charge of conspiring to fix the prices of canned and pouched tuna, and pay a $25 million US fine. The announcement came after two Bumble Bee executives, senior vice-presidents Ken Worsham and Walter Scott Cameron, also pleaded guilty. They agreed to co-operate with authorities in the ongoing investigation, and face jail time and fines. The FBI and Justice Department said their investigation into packaged seafood is aimed at protecting consumers who deserve competitive prices. © The Associated Press, 2017 Report Typo or Error Send Feedback Latest Business Headlines Some Starbucks in U.S. and Canada go cash only after payment systems crash May 16, 3:08 PM ET read comments Temporary foreign worker program prone to abuse, Auditor General says May 16, 10:50 AM ET How Canadian stores are making gains in the grocery wars with big U.S. rivals May 16, 8:54 AM ET read comments New passenger bill of rights spells out compensation for air travellers May 16, 5:13 PM ET read comments United Airlines says cockpit door codes may have been published online May 16, 1:47 PM ET Must Watch Video Changes in the air 7:16 Airline passenger advocate Gabor Lukacs on new rules intended to protect travellers Video Impact on airlines 4:26 Pierre Jeanniot, director general emeritus of the International Air Transport Association, on what the changes will mean for the airline industry Video The Ticker 10:10 Mark Satov, founder of Satov Consultants, on some of the day's top stories Video Growing popularity 5:25 Personal finance expert Preet Banerjee, on the growth in exchange-traded funds Watch The Exchange here Watch Recent shows and interviews Recent discussions about business news and newsmakers Markets TSX COMPOSITE   Rotate stock indices Pause stock rotation Show previous stock PLAY May 17, 2017 12:00 AM ET May 17, 2017 12:00 AM ET May 17, 2017 12:00 AM ET May 17, 2017 12:00 AM ET May 17, 2017 12:00 AM ET Index Last Trade Change TSX COMPOSITE 15543.33 -86.14 DOW 20979.75 -2.19 NASDAQ 6169.87 20.20 SP 500 2400.67 -1.65 TSX-VENTURE 808.27 3.18 The data on this site is informational only and may be delayed; it is not intended as trading or investment advice and you should not rely on it as such.

So that’s what happened. I had a story to tell,” Morgan, 48, told People on Monday. “When anything ever badly happened to me I made it funny and I turned it good. This was a bad thing that happened to me. I wanted to tell my story, but I also want to continue my standup career because all the great things that ever happened to me in my life came through standup.” Morgan’s Netflix special “Staying Alive” was released Tuesday on the streaming service. “All the great things came through standup. I’m just continuing it,” he continued. “Why would I stop? [The accident] wasn’t going to stop me. As long as I could stand up and grab the mic, I was going to tell my story.” In 2014, the “30 Rock” star was severely injured when a Walmart truck hit a van carrying him and fellow comic James McNair, who died in the accident, as well as comedians Ardie Fuqua and Harris Stanton, who were also seriously injured in the collision. Morgan reportedly pocketed $90 million from Walmart when they settled their lawsuit in 2015. “When you look at my earlier work, this is growth. This was me growing a thousand years at the speed of light,” Morgan explained of his comedic evolution. “I look at my old stuff and then I look at this stuff, and I say, ‘Damn. I’ve grown a lot.’ And that’s what it was. It was a terrible, terrible tragedy and some of my greatest material came out of it to date. I don’t know what’s going to come next, hopefully nothing tragic happens like that.” Morgan’s work ethic was also transformed by the experience. “I worked hard to come back,” he said. “I’m not talking about just standup, I’m talking about getting up out that wheelchair. To get up off that walker, I was working hard. I was working hard when I was in a coma. I have a young daughter, I have a wife and I got sons, I got to be here. I’m a fighter, and I fought. That’s what I did with this standup, I fought to do it right.” “The reason I work so hard is I’m afraid to be corny,” Morgan added. “I’m not going to go into no big speech about it. I just don’t want to be corny. My need to help others and my need to love others, that’s what has changed. I know it has. Me as a person changed.” This article originally appeared in the New York Post's Page Six.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obits E-Edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds Weather subscribe Site Site Archive Dispatches from Skip Gorman's AudioBlog: Virgil and Hector and Horseshoes Tuesday May 16, 2017 at 6:00 AM By Skip Gorman | Columnist Here’s another episode of the adventures of my old friend, Virgil, and his mythically old dog, Hector, taking a sideways view of things in our high desert valley. Listen . . . ——— Virgil stopped-by the other day. He and Hector were just on their way back from the local doggie park. “Hector never goes into the park,” Virgil said. “He just likes to sit in the truck with me and watch the other dogs. Of course, he’ll claim it’s because most other dogs annoy him but I think it’s because he’s just shy.” I went and filled-up a water bowl for Hector’s usual spot near the horseshoe pitch and then Virgil and I flipped shoes to see who gets first toss. I won the honors and was lining-up my first pitch when Virgil asked, “Do you inhale or exhale when you step off to throw?” That old rascal always tries to sort of distract me when we compete at horseshoes by blurting out something just as I commit to throw, but I don’t mind. Turns out I hold my breath throughout the entire delivery. It’s not exactly a thinking man’s game, after all, so concentration’s no big deal as we play. There’s no need to be quiet so we usually chat about the local scene out here in the High Desert as we pitch our horseshoes. Hector keeps score for us anyway. “It looks like Tractor Supply is going to open soon,” Virgil said. “What with our big new Super Walmart and Harbor Freight, we may have reached some sort of a brick-and-mortar retail threshold around here. See, when it comes to judging a city’s worthiness to step-up in class, it’s not always about population alone, you know. I imagine that corporate suits in fancy boardrooms will be alerted by sneaky computer analytics when all that retail square footage kicks-in out here. You just can’t fool those Wall Street computers.” We called Hector over to adjudicate a questionable lie (the dog ruled in Virgil’s favor, as usual) and when we continued I asked what Ridgecrest may expect by way of new businesses now that some clever computer’s algorithm tagged us for more growth. “I’m hoping for a shop that sells the stuff that Radio Shack used to sell before they sold out to imported commercial fluff,” Virgil said. “I’m talking about a place where a nerdy hobbyist can rig some discrete components and IC’s and even LSI chips on a circuit board and make the world’s first zero-point energy converter or something. Or where you could buy a set of brass-knurled nixitubes for your nifty steampunk thingamajig. I just miss what Radio Shack almost was.” The horseshoe from Virgil’s last pitch caromed off the stake and rolled to a stop near a half asleep Hector. “Also, I think we’re ready for a Williams-Sonoma store,” Virgil offered. “It could go into the vacant Staples building. I think there are more serious foodies hereabouts than most people realize. So (what the heck!) as long as we’re hungry, I would cash-in most of Hector’s cosmic connection to have a world class Jewish deli like Langer’s in LA to suddenly appear in our sleepy desert berg. Forget the economics! Their pastrami sandwich takes up three spots on my bucket list. Shucks! Throw-in a Famous Dave's BBQ joint and ‘Big time arrived we are’ according to Yoda” I suggested we take a short break for a bite to eat. I had some hard boiled eggs in the fridge along and iced sun tea so we sat with Hector (who munched on what looked like trail mix) and enjoyed watching the ravens wind surfing above the nearby pine trees. “I wonder if a PetSmart would fit this community?” Virgil mused. “Everybody’s got a pet of some kind. Maybe they’ll carry organic roadkill for those ravens of yours.” When horseshoe pitching resumed and Hector adjudged that we were tied, I tossed a 4-point set to Virgil’s 3 and declared myself the winner for this match. “We’re both winners!” Virgil announced. “None of your windows got broken and Hector wasn’t beaned!” A little later, walking back to Virgil’s truck with Hector, I marveled at the growth of Ridgecrest since the U.S. Navy moved out here to test and develop bombs, rockets and missiles in our Upper Mojave Desert. “I remember back when we had a topless bar named the Bamboo Club,” Virgil reminisced. “I don’t think the dancers used a pole back then though. That goofy pole thing all began a bit later. I guess they just sorta winged it.” He and Hector seemed to enjoy that. I wondered out loud if our forthcoming Indian casino might chose to resurrect that sort of entertainment. “If they do,” Virgil answered, “there won’t be much the City could do about it.” We all mused about that because there was a time not too long ago when Ridgecrest had more churches per square foot than any other city on earth. “We still might.” Virgil said, as he climbed into his truck, “This place is always changing one way or another.

Major retailers are taking aim at the most popular tuna brands in the U.S. - Chicken of the Sea, Bumble Bee and StarKist - saying they conspired to keep prices high for consumers. (AP Photo/Eugene Hoshiko) BANGKOK (AP) — Executives of the most popular tuna brands in the U.S. — Chicken of the Sea, Bumble Bee and StarKist — conspired regularly to keep prices high for consumers with a taste for one of America's favorite sandwich ingredients, according to criminal and civil court records updated this week. A typical can of tuna today costs about $1.50 and the U.S. Department of Justice says that price may be the result of price fixing by Thai, South Korean and U.S. seafood dealers, while major retailers are suing alleging they've been ripped off. The U.S. government began investigating criminal price fixing between the three companies more than two years ago. Together the companies supply about 80 percent of the $1.7 billion of canned tuna sold annually in the United States, according to the court records. Following up, Walmart and other top retailers filed civil lawsuits. Those cases were updated this week with an appendix first reported by Undercurrent News that singles out dozens of tuna executives, roping in some of the wealthiest businessmen in Thailand, where Chicken of the Sea's parent company Thai Union is based. "Thai Union does not comment on ongoing legal matters," the company said in a statement. The other firms did not respond immediately for requests for comment. The litigation describes regular telephone calls and meetings where "executives agreed that all three companies would collective raise prices." They also agreed to "limit promotions and packaged tuna that undercut their published pricing," according to court records. Get news headlines sent daily to your inbox Sign Up!

Thai Union's president and CEO Thiraphong Chansiri, his father Kraisorn Chansiri and dozens of other Thai and American executives are now identified specifically in the ongoing case. Thai Union owns Chicken of the Sea, Red Lobster and U.S. Pet Nutrition, among other companies. In-Gu Park, acting president of South Korea-based Dongwon Enterprise, which owns StarKist, and Chris Lischewski, president and CEO of San Diego-based BumbleBee also were named in the court records. Although fewer Americans eat tuna every year, it's still a mainstay in most kitchens and the country's favorite type of fish. Canned tuna was popularized during World War 1, when it was a convenient protein for troops who returned home and continued to ask for it. Last week in the criminal case in San Francisco, Bumble Bee Foods said it would plead guilty to a felony charge of conspiring to fix the prices of canned and pouched tuna, and pay a $25 million fine. The announcement came after two Bumble Bee executives, senior vice-presidents Ken Worsham and Walter Scott Cameron, also pleaded guilty. They agreed to cooperate with authorities in the ongoing investigation, and face jail time and fines. The FBI and Justice Department said their investigation into packaged seafood is aimed at protecting consumers who deserve competitive prices. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

The bet was that the Trump administration would deregulate the financial sector and approve a massive infrastructure bill. Prices in commodities like steel and copper ticked up in anticipation. Six months later, little of this Trump Trade has come to fruition. The Republican majority is still working to pass a health care bill, and no deregulation, tax reform, or infrastructure spending are in sight. But that hasn’t slowed the stock market. The S&P 500 closed at a record high yesterday afternoon, and is up over $1.5 trillion since the start of 2017. And the companies doing the most to drive that rally are all tech firms. Apple, Alphabet, Facebook, Amazon, and Microsoft make up a whopping 37 percent of the total gains. Half of this year's stock rally = 10 companies. (via @GoldmanSachs @NickatFP)pic.twitter.com/zZB0lLSCdG— Carl Quintanilla (@carlquintanilla) May 11, 2017 All of these companies saw their share prices touch record highs in recent months. This is in stark contrast to the rest of the US economy, which grew at a rate of less than 1 percent during the first three months of this year. That divide is the culmination of a long-term trend, according to a recent report featured in The Wall Street Journal: In digital industries—technology, communications, media, software, finance and professional services—productivity grew 2.7% annually over the past 15 years...The slowdown is concentrated in physical industries—health care, transportation, education, manufacturing, retail—where productivity grew a mere 0.7% annually over the same period. Here’s a dramatic illustration of that trend, in the form of a handy chart from this Recode story on Amazon’s recent success. It took Amazon 15 years to match the market capitalization of Walmart. Two years later, it is worth more than double its biggest rival. And while Amazon’s share price is hitting all-time highs, the rest of the retail sector is gasping for air. Another example, this time from the education sector, is Google’s venture into the classroom back in 2012. In the five years since it has spread to more than half the primary and secondary schools in the US. Here’s Hal Friedlander, former chief information officer for the New York City Department of Education, the nation’s largest school district, talking to The New York Times: “Between the fall of 2012 and now, Google went from an interesting possibility to the dominant way that schools around the country teach students to find information, create documents and turn them in. Google established itself as a fact in schools.” There is no industry where these players aren’t competing. Music, movies, shipping, delivery, transportation, energy — the list goes on and on. As these companies continue to scale, the network effects bolstering their business are strengthening. Facebook and Google accounted for over three-quarters of the growth in the digital advertising industry in 2016, leaving the rest to be divided among small fry like Twitter, Snapchat, and the entire American media industry. Meanwhile Apple and Alphabet have achieved a virtual duopoly on mobile operating systems, with only a tiny sliver of consumers choosing an alternative for their smartphones and tablets. In another era, Google dominance in search, Facebook’s commanding lead in social, or Amazon’s massive reach in e-commerce might lead regulators to view them as a monopoly. There has been some pushback in Europe, but so far US watchdogs haven’t taken any aggressive action. In part that’s because companies born during or after the dot-com days saw what happened to Microsoft. They found ways to soften their image and avoid the kind of sharp-elbowed competition that might draw the wrong kind of attention. But it’s also because these companies don’t resemble the monopolies our laws were designed to prevent. Writing in the Yale Law Journal earlier this year, Lina Kahn argued that “the current framework in antitrust—specifically its pegging competition to ‘consumer welfare,’ defined as short-term price effects—is unequipped to capture the architecture of market power in the modern economy.” How do you measure the impact, positive or negative, to the average consumer when products like search and social media are given away for free, and the cost of switching to a new platform is just a few clicks? How do you make the case against Amazon when it drives costs down for consumers and has, over the years, produced little to no profit for itself? By positioning themselves as the platforms on top of which information technology across every sector now runs, these titans of tech become the new centers of gravity for our economy, growing in size, scope, and influence while everyone else struggles not to fall too far behind. Meanwhile, Silicon Valley tries to convince the rest of America that it’s not coming for their jobs.

Every time I come into the kitchen, it’s playing on the stereo. We are back in the United States now. It’s time to get over it. Let’s move on.” I had one word for her. “No.” She had a great time in Cuba, as did we all, so I’m not sure why she thinks we have to come back to real life. In my opinion, reality is highly overrated, anyway. If I have to listen to hour upon hour of their migraine-inducing hip-hop and auto-tuned pop music on a daily basis, I’m pretty sure they can live through a little rumba, timba and son, which some experts consider the best music in the world. To catch you up, my son, Cheetah Boy, daughter Curly Girl and four friends went to Cuba recently for eight days. We flew JetBlue out of the Long Beach airport and changed planes in Ft. Lauderdale, into Havana. It was easy and affordable. It was cheaper than flying to New York. You should go. I’m writing a travel story about our trip, so I won’t get into details, but let’s just say it exceeded my expectations. I’m not sure I really knew what to expect, to tell the truth, since Cuba remains such a mystery to most Americans. I only knew that I wanted to get there before the American trade embargo is lifted, and the entire island is overtaken with McDonald’s restaurants, Subway shops, Costco stores and Walmart. Think I’m joking? What’s at the bottom of the Spanish steps in Rome? A McDonald’s. Across the street from Windsor Castle? McDonald’s. At the Museum of Communism in Prague? McDonald’s. Like cockroaches, they’re everywhere. Apparently, there actually already is a McDonald’s in Cuba, but it’s only on the American base at Guantanamo Bay. Probably part of the torture terrorists endure at the notorious prison there. Just kidding, it’s there to serve the Naval service members, who apparently don’t have enough punishment being forced to live on a military base in a paradise they can’t visit. But, forget about McDonald’s. I want to talk about Cuba, where there are no other McDonald’s restaurants, nor a single Holiday Inn, Burger King or Starbucks. Just the absence of Starbucks alone would make it a worthwhile destination in my book, but there are also beautiful beaches, fascinating crumbling architecture, revolutionary rhetoric, great music and cheap rum. You don’t miss the Starbucks, by the way, because Cuban coffee is everywhere and delicious, especially if you like your java thick enough for the spoon to stand up by itself. I was glad I’d brought my son along, because we needed someone young and buff enough to haul seven suitcases up and down the endless staircases of our ancient guesthouses in Havana and the town of Trinidad. Cheetah Boy was also useful when we took a hike in the Cienaga de Zapata natural park, which consisted of walking on ancient limestone formations and looking for birds and wildlife in a forest, until we were dripping with sweat and dehydrated. He lent me a hand and helped me haul my keister up and down the limestone rocks that everyone else seemed to leap over like mountain goats. Ironically, I didn’t fall until the end, when a low-lying branch did me in and I landed flat on my back with a whomp. Luckily, it was embarrassing but not painful. Speaking of the endless staircases, I bitterly resent the implication that I was drunk just because it took me 10 minutes to get down from the rooftop terrace of the La Concordia restaurant in Havana. Yes, I was swaying, but only because I had to hold my long dress in one hand while I navigated three floors of narrow stairs. Admittedly, I drank two mojitos, a pina colada and a glass of wine during dinner, but the grilled lobster and vegetables soaked all that up. So stop the slander and stop it now. As some of you know, I’ve been on a health kick this year and lost the equivalent of Brittany Spears in body weight by laying off junk food, booze and most animal products. Well, that didn’t happen in Cuba. I not only ate everything I wanted – which mostly consisted of fish fresh from the ocean—but I also drank just a tiny bit of rum. You know I like to save money, and it was very cheap. Also, healthy, when you consider I mixed in fresh mint in the mojitos, freshly juiced coconut and pineapple in the pina coladas, and tomato juice in the Cubanitos. It was really a health food. So, maybe the Presidente beer wasn’t a health food, but I’m sure if I spent some time on the Internet, I could find health benefits for beer. Speaking of the Internet, there isn’t any in Cuba. Well, that’s not true, but it’s very limited. Most people don’t have Internet in their homes, and if you want to get online, you have to go to a public park and buy a wi-fi card for a couple bucks that will get you on for an hour. It’s easy to find these parks, because it’s the only place where people are sitting and staring at their phones, unlike at home, of course, where they do it 24 hours a day. It was delightful being unplugged, and especially having actual conversations with my children that didn’t involve them turning away to watch a cat video in the middle of our talk. At first, the teens had painful withdrawal symptoms, but by the end of the trip, they weren’t even bothering to buy wi-fi cards or sneak out to the park. One of my friends said on our return that she was worried about us, because none of us were posting anything on social media, so there was general concern that we might have been arrested by the Cuban government. But, instead we were arrested by the stunning Caribbean beaches, the kind and funny people, the irresistible music, the dancing, the glory of crumbling cities, the step backward into the past, the life without televisions or junk food, swaying palm trees and humid, tropical air. So, no, my beautiful daughter. I won’t get over Cuba. Though I might have to get over the five pounds I gained while I was there. Let me just have a few more mojitos, first.   Frumpy Middle-age Mom family at the Bay of Pigs, Cuba Get the latest news delivered daily!

Criminal and civil cases allege executives at the largest canned tuna companies were agreeing to collectively raise prices and limit promotions. Major retailers are taking aim at the most popular tuna brands in the U.S. - Chicken of the Sea, Bumble Bee and StarKist - saying they conspired to keep prices high for consumers. (AP Photo/Eugene Hoshiko) .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... ..........BANGKOK — Executives of the most popular tuna brands in the U.S. — Chicken of the Sea, Bumble Bee and StarKist — conspired regularly to keep prices high for consumers with a taste for one of America’s favorite sandwich ingredients, according to criminal and civil court records updated this week. A typical can of tuna today costs about $1.50 and the U.S. Department of Justice says that price may be the result of price fixing by Thai, South Korean and U.S. seafood dealers, while major retailers are suing alleging they’ve been ripped off. The U.S. government began investigating criminal price fixing between the three companies more than two years ago. Together the companies supply about 80 percent of the $1.7 billion of canned tuna sold annually in the United States, according to the court records. Following up, Walmart and other top retailers filed civil lawsuits. Those cases were updated this week with an appendix first reported by Undercurrent News that singles out dozens of tuna executives, roping in some of the wealthiest businessmen in Thailand, where Chicken of the Sea’s parent company Thai Union is based. “Thai Union does not comment on ongoing legal matters,” the company said in a statement. The other firms did not respond immediately for requests for comment. Advertisement Continue reading The litigation describes regular telephone calls and meetings where “executives agreed that all three companies would collective raise prices.” They also agreed to “limit promotions and packaged tuna that undercut their published pricing,” according to court records. Thai Union’s president and CEO Thiraphong Chansiri, his father Kraisorn Chansiri and dozens of other Thai and American executives are now identified specifically in the ongoing case. Thai Union owns Chicken of the Sea, Red Lobster and U.S. Pet Nutrition, among other companies. In-Gu Park, acting president of South Korea-based Dongwon Enterprise, which owns StarKist, and Chris Lischewski, president and CEO of San Diego-based BumbleBee also were named in the court records. Although fewer Americans eat tuna every year, it’s still a mainstay in most kitchens and the country’s favorite type of fish. Canned tuna was popularized during World War 1, when it was a convenient protein for troops who returned home and continued to ask for it. Last week in the criminal case in San Francisco, Bumble Bee Foods said it would plead guilty to a felony charge of conspiring to fix the prices of canned and pouched tuna, and pay a $25 million fine. The announcement came after two Bumble Bee executives, senior vice-presidents Ken Worsham and Walter Scott Cameron, also pleaded guilty. They agreed to cooperate with authorities in the ongoing investigation, and face jail time and fines. The FBI and Justice Department said their investigation into packaged seafood is aimed at protecting consumers who deserve competitive prices.

Courtesy of Alamo Drafthouse Cinema Business May 16, 2017 8:16 AM Hey, movie and beer lovers: Alamo Drafthouse is coming to Raleigh By Paul A. Specht aspecht@newsobserver.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story RALEIGH A new craft-beer-selling, indie-film-screening theater is coming to town. Alamo Drafthouse Cinema on Tuesday announced its plans to open an 11-screen theater, bar and restaurant in the Longview Shopping Center at the corner of New Bern Avenue and King Charles Road in east Raleigh. Alamo is known for its theater recliners and “zero tolerance policy” for moviegoers who disrupt films with talking or texting. Its theaters show new releases, indie, foreign and classic films on 35mm projectors, according to the company. In Raleigh, the theaters will have 660 seats and the beer hall will have 36 local beers on tap. It hopes to open by the end of the year. The Austin, Texas-based company, which has 27 locations across the United States, searched for a site in Raleigh for five years before settling on Longview, founder Tim League said. “We love Raleigh,” he said. “We have family here and have spent a lot of time in North Carolina.” Some Raleigh leaders hope the project will help revive the stretch of New Bern Avenue, which is a gateway into downtown. Downtown’s boom of new restaurants and retail space has not extended into east Raleigh. City Council member Corey Branch, who represents east Raleigh, said the area hasn’t had much commercial growth since Walmart opened years ago at the corner of New Bern and New Hope Road. The Longview Shopping Center has struggled to rebound since Winn-Dixie left roughly 20 years ago, Branch said. “It’s been blighted and going down ever since,” he said. “This will create jobs for those in the community, bring some positive light to the overall area amid all the changes that have taken place, and I think can be a catalyst.” Current tenants at the center include Family Dollar and AutoZone. It’s unclear whether they will be affected by Almo’s plans. Branch said the shopping center will also benefit from new sidewalks along New Bern, which the city plans to build from Tarboro Street to Sunnybrook Road by spring 2019. The Wake Transit Plan, which calls for more buses along the road, will also help the shopping center, said Dan Douglas, director of the New Bern Avenue Corridor Alliance. “Their confidence in the future of the New Bern Corridor sends a strong signal to the market,” Douglas said in a news release from Alamo. “The coming of new transit, new bike paths, new sidewalks and better connections to the greenway system will all help to make Alamo Drafthouse and the corridor succeed together.” League said the company is expanding to North Carolina despite having qualms about House Bill 2, the law enacted last year that forbade local anti-discrimination protections for LGBT people and required everyone in government facilities to use bathrooms that match the gender on their birth certificate. Two months ago, state lawmakers passed a new law that repealed HB2 but restricts anti-discrimination ordinances in cities and counties until 2020. “Rather than walking away from this community, however, we are committing our support and making our stance very clear,” League said. “We support the unconditional repeal of HB2 and have designed our restroom facilities to be adaptable to a future without binary constraints.” Alamo Drafthouse plans to support LGBTQ programming, events and fundraisers at the theater, he said. Alamo will expand the crop of cinemas near downtown Raleigh that includes The Rialto, Wells Fargo IMAX Theatre at Marbles and Mission Valley Cinema. Alamo is giving away movies for a year to someone who signs up for its free “Victory loyalty” program.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    Across the world, a nascent recovery for inflation has stirred optimism that after years of soggy demand, prices may finally be gaining escape velocity. A dose of inflation, within reason, helps economies grow by boosting company profits -- with textbooks telling us wages should follow -- and makes debt easier to service (at least until interest rates rise). The latest reflation burst was sparked last year by a big turnaround in Chinese factory prices and an improving outlook for global growth. But this may not herald a return to inflation as we once knew it. Unlike previous cycles when prices accelerated and policy makers had to step in and cool demand, a damper this time around is the dizzying pace of innovations in the retail sector. The rise of online shopping and price comparison websites has hooked consumers on discounts. And even when people tear themselves from their screens and actually make it to the shops, fewer staff and less glitzy stores are keeping prices down there too. It’s a development that economists at an Australian bank have dubbed the “Aldi-isation effect” after the German discount supermarket known for its no-frills approach. “The cutting edge of retail will continue to increase price competition and thus carry a deflationary drag,” said Richard Yetsenga, who is the Sydney-based chief economist at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. “The ‘Aldi-isation’ trend is here to stay.” The 2017 Total Retail report from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP found that 47 percent of the 24,471 respondents surveyed across the globe use Amazon.com as a research site for prices. Japan, Germany, Brazil and the U.S. were found to be the top four countries where consumers shop less often at brick-and-mortar stores due to the "Amazon effect." “Competition has never been fiercer,” said John Maxwell, global retail & consumer leader at the consultancy. The results can be seen around the world. In the U.S., the consumer price index for apparel has been going nowhere, as the chart below illustrates: Discounting is probably playing a role in holding down retail wages too, at least in the U.S. where the retail category shows the smallest 12-month wage gain of all sectors tracked in the monthly U.S. employment report, according to NatWest Markets. Japan’s central bank is desperately trying to stoke inflation, warning last month that cheap mobile phone handsets and connection fees are weighing on the consumer price index. The bank attributed this to intensified competition from virtual network operators. Reflation Trade Investors have been scaling back their optimism on inflation picking up since the start of the year. The global bond market measures price-growth expectations through breakeven rates, which is the yield spread between sovereign debt and inflation-protected securities with a similar maturity. While still up from year ago levels, breakeven rates in Group of Seven countries have fallen from peaks earlier in 2017. In the U.S., the 10-year breakeven rate is about 1.9 percentage points, down from a 2017-high of 2.09 percentage points in January. It’s 1.16 percentage points in Germany and 0.46 percentage points in Japan, both down from earlier this year. Internet Disruption Jack Ma, Chairman of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., has warned of decades of pain as the Internet disrupts economies. China’s consumer prices climbed 1.2 percent in April, less than half the government’s target of around 3 percent, even as data from the nation’s dominant bank card network and No. 2 e-commerce platform JD.com Inc show consumption remains buoyant. Aldi is planning its biggest remodeling investment ever in the U.S. in a bid to steal market share from big supermarket chains. At the same time, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. is ramping up its e-commerce operations. The American retail industry started off the year closing brick-and-mortar stores at a record pace, according to Credit Suisse estimates. In Canada, the country’s largest grocer is braced for a prolonged period of food deflation. Loblaw Cos. is fighting a price war with Wal-Mart, Metro Inc. and others as they race to offer discounts. “I can’t remember any retailer I’ve talked to who is counting on inflation helping them out,” said Erik Gordon, a professor at the Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, who has been covering retail trends for almost 30 years. “They’re all looking for ways to cut costs, because they’re expecting it to get worse. They’re not expecting it to get better.” To be sure, competition among retailers isn’t new and the picture for inflation globally varies regionally and is impacted by a number of forces. Volatile food and energy prices are crucial swing factors, especially in emerging markets. On the supply side, prices for manufactured goods aren’t going anywhere fast as the next generation of cheap labor economies nip at China’s heals and robots replace workers in economies with higher labor costs, allowing them to become competitive again. Developed nations have for years flirted with deflation for reasons that had less to do with online shopping and more to do with tepid underlying economies, which are grayer and aren’t enjoying the fruits of a burgeoning consumer class.  Restrained credit growth from companies and consumers still scarred by the crisis has also damped demand. That means less cash is chasing goods and services in the real economy -- which tells you all you need to know about today’s subdued prices according to monetarist orthodoxy. And that’s where reflationists see things turning around. The world’s biggest central banks are continuing easy policies, while China’s shift from factory deflation to rising prices could start to be shipped around the world as exporters there increase asking prices. Rate Impact Still, the importance of consumption -- it accounted for 58 percent of global GDP in 2015 according to the World Bank -- means sweeping changes in shopping patterns will act as a restraint on the pace of inflation and could be a factor determining how quickly central banks tighten should global growth continue to perk up. The International Monetary Fund is projecting average inflation in the G-7 will be sub-2 percent in the medium-term horizon. While that’s better than the sub-1 percent inflation in 2015 and 2016, it’s below most central bank inflation targets. Back in Australia, more competition is on the way with Amazon.com Inc due to expand operations in the country this year. “We are expecting a general global trend to higher interest rates over the next couple of years,” said Yetsenga. “But Aldi-isation suggests the move will be slow.” © Copyright 2017 Bloomberg News.

By: IANS | Washington | Updated: May 16, 2017 5:33 pm Apple has been critical of Trump’s immigration orders, bringing a strain in their relation with the President. ( Source: Reuters) Apple’s $1 billion investment in US manufacturing — in line with President Donald Trump’s domestic economic agenda — has been termed as a sign of optimism by White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer. “From Intel to General Motors to Walmart to Apple who specifically just announced earlier this month they will start a $1 billion fund to promote advanced manufacturing jobs here in the US. And it’s not just the President’s domestic economic policies that are generating optimism,” Spicer said at a press briefing on Monday. Corning Glass, one of Apple’s US-based suppliers, has been announced as the first recipient of funds from the programme and will be awarded $200 million, The Verge reported. The Advanced Manufacturing Fund was announced by Apple CEO earlier this month but he made no mention of it being influenced by or created as a result of Trump’s policies. “The $1 billion programme is designed to foster innovative production and highly skilled jobs that will help lay the foundation for a new era of technology-driven manufacturing in the US,” the report quoted Apple as saying. Apple has been critical of Trump’s immigration orders, bringing a strain in their relation with the President. “With each administration, in every country in the world, there are things you disagree and things you agree. And you look to find common ground and try to influence the things you don’t. If you don’t show up, I think that’s the worst scenario. Because then you’re quiet and this doesn’t do your cause any good, or your point of view any good,” Tim Cook, CEO Apple said. Also Read: Apple to invest $200 million in scratch-resistant glass He hoped that the government will soon enact sweeping tax policy reforms.According to media reports, the $1 billion fund could be one way for Apple to win leverage in Washington as Trump works to advance his proposals. However, Trump has been criticised for taking credit for economic deals that were first announced during Barack Obama’s presidency.

Green Posted: 7:30 AM, May 16, 2017 Updated: 11:12 AM, May 16, 2017 The Tazewell Teen Initiative included having engineers identify dangerous county roads and add necessary signage. Photograph: Sam VarnHagen It was Sept. 30 when Lisa Scott, a mother of three, was watching the 10 o’clock news and saw the breaking news alert: A 16-year-old boy lost control of his speeding vehicle and struck a tree, killing himself and his two 15-year-old passengers. The driver had his license for a week. To make matters worse, it was the second teen car crash in the county in six months. Scott, who couldn’t help but think of her oldest son, Drew, also a new driver, calls the news “terrifying,” adding, “You are sending your most precious cargo off in that vehicle.” The teens in the September crash were from Pekin, a town of about 30,000 people and the county seat of Tazewell, which boasts upwards of 135,000 people on 650-square miles of mostly farmland in central Illinois. Although the kids weren’t from the Scott’s Tremont, Ill. village, a rural area with about 2,100 residents and a grain elevator as its tallest landmark; she says the kids were part of their broader community. Jeff Lower agrees. “It doesn’t matter where you go, somebody knows some of these teens who were dying,” says the Pekin resident and chief deputy of the Tazewell County Sheriff’s Department. “My own kids went to high school with four of the kids.” Scott told her son what happened, fully aware he—like most teens—thought he was invincible. What no one knew, though, was that in the 15 months from March 2005 to July 2006, Tazewell County and the surrounding communities would mourn the loss of 15 teenagers who died in crashes caused by everything from speeding, alcohol and drugs to inexperience, fatigue and poor lighting. A month later, in October, a motorcycle crash on a dark rural road killed two boys. Three months later, alcohol and excessive speeds contributed to the deaths of two Tremont teens. “I was at home watching TV, and we started getting phone calls about the situation,” explains Jeff Hinman, superintendent of the Tremont School District. Hinman didn’t have time to dwell on his grief. The number of teens dying on local roads was escalating, and the community was reeling. Before classes resumed, the then-high school principal needed to assemble a team to help the school’s 300 students, teachers and other staff members process their own confusion and sorrow. “We mobilized local clergy and counselors at other schools just to provide space for kids to talk with if they need to,” Hinman says. “And then we had to make them available to attend the visitations and funerals.” Although the tragic crashes transpired 11 years ago, like other Tazewell County residents, Drew Scott recalls where he was when he heard about his Tremont schoolmates. “I was at church when it happened,” he says, adding he knew the boys casually. “I remember walking into school the next day, and it was silent. Every hallway was silent. They had grief counselors for us, and we spent the day sitting around and talking and connecting with people.” His family attended both visitations, but Lisa Scott says her fear of losing her own son made acknowledging the families’ losses difficult. What’s more, despite the eight fatalities in less than a year, Drew Scott says kids didn’t understand the magnitude of what was happening. “I think a lot of what we felt initially was that what was happening was sort of unavoidable. We, as high school kids and new drivers, didn’t realize this was unusual.” Law enforcement did. There came a point when the Tazewell County sheriff’s deputies began to dread radio dispatches about a crash with unknown injuries. “We all would think, ‘Oh no, is this another teenager?’ remembers Deputy Sheriff John Shallenberger. Soon, the officers began asking what was next. “There was no pattern to it,” says Shallenberger, a Pekin resident. Not knowing why there were so many fatalities added to the devastation. “It wasn’t like we could say they were all speeding or they were all doing something wrong,” Lower says. “There were different reasons. There was speeding and some alcohol and drugs, sure; but one ran a stop sign. Some were just inexperienced; one cause was fatigue. We had one run into a piece of farm equipment. There were all kinds of reasons. It made me worry much more about my own children.” Getting the life-altering call When his mom and pop, Michelle and Gary Watson, traveled to Missouri for a family member’s funeral, Jeremy Watson did what many adventurous teenagers do when their parents are away: He invited friends over for a party. Why not? Not only was the house free from parents but also his 21-year-old brother, Josh, was at charity event for the evening. A recent high school graduate, Jeremy and his girlfriend, Lacey, had big plans. They would live in the country and have a bunch of kids. Lacey wanted a horse; and though Jeremy had a good job working at his dad’s construction company, he’d didn’t yet have the money to buy it for her. So, before the party on June 17, he diligently bailed hay for a local farmer to work off the cost. The next morning, as the 18-year-old’s parents made their way back home, Michelle Watson's cellphone rang. HUFFING the act of inhaling chemical vapors to attain a “high” feeling. What addicts are huffing (inhaling or sniffing): solvents (liquids that become gas at room temperature) often used for industrial products and art and office supplies aerosol sprays, household items like hair spray or vegetable oil sprays gases, often found in lighters, whipped cream dispensers, anesthesia nitrites, in room deodorizer and leather cleaners Huffing can cause: liver and kidney damage hearing loss bone marrow damage loss of coordination and limb spasms (from nerve damage) delayed behavioral development (from brain problems) brain damage (from cut-off oxygen flow to the brain) Source: National Institute on Drug Abuse “Our soon-to-be daughter-in-law called and asked us where we were,” explains Watson, who adds they had just stopped to grab a bite to eat. “She told us to skip lunch and come home. I asked what was going on and she hung up. I called back.” Though Josh didn’t want them to learn while they were on the road that Jeremy was dead, Watson pried out the details. “My heart went to my throat. Numbness. You just don’t believe what you just heard.” After that, she says there was a lot of tears and a lot of screaming. Michelle Watson recites the story plainly though not matter-of-factly at schools and at the request of parents at their wit’s end. She says the events unfolded like this: Apparently, Josh arrived at their Topeka, Ill., home (located just outside of Tazewell) after his charity event and shut down Jeremy’s party, taking car keys from teenagers too impaired to drive. Then Jeremy and two boys—who had just gotten off work and hadn’t been drinking at the party—wanted to grab a bite. Since Jeremy, who had had a few beers, wasn’t going to be driving, Josh said no problem. Information from detectives, the coroner and sheriff’s deputies reveals the remaining details: After leaving Steak ‘N Shake, the boys went to Walmart where Jeremy’s friends purchased a can of air dust, used mostly to clean computer keyboards. Because purchasers must be 18, the story clerk properly requested ID. Then, Watson explains, “The driver sent a mass text message to other kids saying ‘huffing.’” Huffing is one term for inhaling chemical vapors to get high. It wasn’t long afterward that the driver passed out and the vehicle, which was now on a Tazewell County road, zoomed more than 1,700 feet, overturned, caught fire and killed all three 18-year-olds. It was a Sunday morning. Father’s Day. Four weeks after the teens graduated high school. Jeremy Watson during a fishing trip with his dad, Gary Watson Months later, Watson learned that in the 12 hours before getting behind the wheel, the driver and other passenger had also snorted an eight-ball of cocaine and smoked five joints. “We didn’t get to see them because they were burnt so badly. They had to be identified by DNA and dental records.” Before getting the call that changed her life, Watson says her heart went out to the parents whose children died in the previous wrecks. She knew then: “A parent should never have to bury their child.” After burying their youngest son, the Watsons sold their house, moved to Manito, Ill., and stopped celebrating Mother’s and Father’s Day. Gary Watson has only recently begun hunting and fishing again. Adds Michelle Watson, “For two years, we didn’t do Christmas and didn’t do Thanksgiving. Your whole world falls apart.” Coming together for change Everybody wanted to do something, but nobody knew what to do, says Chief Deputy Lower. “It just seemed like there was no end.” Everyone from the Sheriff’s department and Health Department to teens, parents and business leaders began working toward solutions. Deputy Shallenberger says deputies started running ideas by students on the County Youth Board. “They helped us create videos talking about what they went through.” Youth Board member Drew Scott said the group was addressing issues of youth drug prevention and sex, but made drunk driving prevention and seatbelt use another priority. To combat teen driving deaths, enforcement teams: Worked 1,200 extra traffic hours Issued nearly 2,000 citations Stopped nearly 2,200 vehicles Created drunkstopper.com, an anonymous phone and e-mail tip hotline for reporting underage drinking parties Created Wheel Rewards giveaways Established Shoulder-to-Shoulder, showing their support for students at high school football and basketball games The community soon established the four-part Tazewell Teen Initiative, a multifaceted intergovernmental group made up of Enforcement, Engineering, Emergency and Education subcommittees. Enforcement was a partnership between the Sheriff’s office, Illinois State Police, County Coroner and local law enforcement. “We started giving kids safety citations—like a prepaid gas card or something like it—when they did well,” Shallenberger says. “Students who maintained good grades and didn’t get a ticket during the year would get entered into a drawing to win a car.” The Engineering subcommittee reviewed various roadways to identify and improve the most dangerous intersections and installed better signage, including the bright arrows called chevrons, signaling to drivers that a potentially dangerous curve is coming. Emergency Services (EMTs and fire personnel) united to find solutions. And the Education subcommittee, comprised of teens, the Health Department, Illinois Department of Transportation (IDot), the American Red Cross and others, created billboards and radio and television commercials. Mike Stout, then director of the Division of Traffic Safety for IDot and a Governors Highway Safety Association (GHSA) representative, says county and city, town law enforcement, state police, school superintendents, high school representatives, businesses and municipalities all gathered to discuss the issues. At the same time, a state task force was discussing the lack of restrictions on new teenage drivers. Informing them about the tragedies in Tazewell County helped push them toward adopting graduated driver’s licenses, explains Stout, who’s now retired. Then, the state’s Secretary of Transportation told Stout about Ford Driving Skills for Life, a free program Ford Motor Company Fund, the GHSA and safety experts founded in 2003 to help teens gain safe driving skills beyond what’s taught in most driver education programs. Ford challenges students to do better Ford DSFL proposed a challenge where each of the seven high schools would develop their own teen safe driving programs, and then present those programs for judging a few months later, says Jim Graham, global manager for Ford DSFL. In 2007, each school received a $3,000 budget toward its programs. At the end, they could win $5,000 toward a school party and savings bonds. Schools held safety days that included a poster contest and yielded slogans like “A Click Every Time Keeps the Cops Off Your Behind.” Scott says Tremont High School started with seatbelt use. “We just hid and, as covertly as we could, watched to see how many students came in and went out with seatbelts,” says Scott. “We would do announcements on the intercom about how well we did.” Graham and Stout remember Dee Mack High School in Mackinaw, Ill., covering the town with signs, and messages related to safe driving. “We did the program and then all the schools got to come to the ride-and-drive event, which we’re doing the 10th anniversary on,” Shallenberger says. “It was neat to see how they worked together.” Superintendent Hinman says on top of the news stories surrounding the crashes, having Ford DSFL come into the community created an awareness. “It made people think ‘Oh, my gosh. This is really important.’” Advanced drivers training from Ford Driving Skills for Life What: Ford DSFL, Tazewell County, Illinois Department of Transportation and others in Illinois mark 10 years of engagement as part of the Operation Teen Safe Driving program established in Tazewell County in 2007 When: Thursday, May 18, 2017 8:30 a.m. – 5 p.m.: Hands-on drivers training for Tazewell County teen drivers 10 a.m.: Press conference Where: Illinois Army National Guard - hanger 2323 S. Airport Rd., Peoria, Ill 61607 More important than the competition, Graham says, was the hands-on driving clinic program that followed. DSFL selected students, faculty, driver’s education teachers and others from each school and set up a small course at Pekin airport. The program put participants through real-world driver training with professional drivers from all over the United States. “A lot of the crashes happened because they were speeding or because of lack of skills,” Graham says. “We focused on providing advance driving skills and on changing their mindset about driving. Making sure they don’t speed, don’t drink and drive, that they buckle up. We taught them about spacing between vehicles and potential hazards, about what to do when there’s something in front of you, about impaired driving. Our hope was they would learn some things and take it back to the schools and then that information would cascade to the kids who didn’t get to go.” Hinman recollects the simulation where kids would put on goggles and drive golf carts. “That was an eye-opening experience for them because they were able to experience what impaired driving felt like. It hit home because they could compare it to what it was like when you were not impaired.” The professional drivers showed Drew Scott what to do if his car went into a skid. His mom, Lisa Scott, gained an appreciation for how kids watch their parents and absorb driving habits from them. She also realized it takes more than parents to teach good driving skills and that most schools don’t have the resources to teach kids what they need to know. “When we tell our kids stuff, they don’t really listen. But when a professional driver is putting the car in a skid and getting it out, they listen. “That tragedy was terrifying,” Scott adds. “We as a community, as parents and as a student body took the resources Ford had to offer and worked with the kids closely to reduce teen deaths.” Indeed, after the County united and the DSFL program started, Shallenberger says the community went five years without one teen fatality. He says the program even went statewide, to 105 high schools. Graham says the eight-year statewide program, called Operation Teen Safe Driving, was a partnership between Ford DSFL, the Illinois Department of Transportation and Allstate Insurance. “Each school got a financial stipend for them to do things in their school and in their community to get the word out about teen safe driving, just like in Tazewell County,” he says. In all, Graham estimates Operation Teen Safe Driving, which received national awards, trained more than 300,000 students, parents and community and business leaders. “At the end of those eight years, teen deaths in Illinois declined 50 percent. That’s huge,” Graham says. “Graduated driver’s licenses helped. Everybody working together helped. That’s a big deal.” Shallenberger and Deputy Chuck Linton -- who helped develop the Tazewell County’s Decision Driving program and promote Operation Teen Safe Driving -- along with deputies Jeff Rogers and Rich Brock, continued educating teens even after the program ended. Even Michelle Watson began educating students and parents about the dangers of impaired driving. “I jumped in the following year (2007) and started speaking at the schools when the Red Cross started doing these mock prom crashes,” she says. She tells students: “My son, Jeremy, had a job, a girlfriend, a four-wheeler. He had a dog. He had a life. Don’t make your mom have to pick out your casket. Make your choices wisely. If you get into trouble, call your parents. Yeah, they are going to be upset, but at least you’ll be alive.” She adds, “If I can save one parent, I’ve done my job.” Copyright 2017 by WDIV ClickOnDetroit - All rights reserved.

Criminal and civil cases allege executives at the largest canned tuna companies were agreeing to collectively raise prices and limit promotions. Major retailers are taking aim at the most popular tuna brands in the U.S. - Chicken of the Sea, Bumble Bee and StarKist - saying they conspired to keep prices high for consumers. (AP Photo/Eugene Hoshiko) by MARTHA MENDOZA, The Associated Press Close icon MARTHA MENDOZA The Associated Press BANGKOK (AP) - Executives of the most popular tuna brands in the U.S. - Chicken of the Sea, Bumble Bee and StarKist - conspired regularly to keep prices high for consumers with a taste for one of America's favorite sandwich ingredients, according to criminal and civil court records updated this week. Slideshow Feds and Walmart allege canned tuna prices fixed Advertisment of Gallery: Facebook icon Twitter icon Pinterest Mail icon A typical can of tuna today costs about $1.50 and the U.S. Department of Justice says that price may be the result of price fixing by Thai, South Korean and U.S. seafood dealers, while major retailers are suing alleging they've been ripped off. The U.S. government began investigating criminal price fixing between the three companies more than two years ago. Together the companies supply about 80 percent of the $1.7 billion of canned tuna sold annually in the United States, according to the court records. Following up, Walmart and other top retailers filed civil lawsuits. Those cases were updated this week with an appendix first reported by Undercurrent News that singles out dozens of tuna executives, roping in some of the wealthiest businessmen in Thailand, where Chicken of the Sea's parent company Thai Union is based. "Thai Union does not comment on ongoing legal matters," the company said in a statement. The other firms did not respond immediately for requests for comment. The litigation describes regular telephone calls and meetings where "executives agreed that all three companies would collective raise prices." They also agreed to "limit promotions and packaged tuna that undercut their published pricing," according to court records. Thai Union's president and CEO Thiraphong Chansiri, his father Kraisorn Chansiri and dozens of other Thai and American executives are now identified specifically in the ongoing case. Thai Union owns Chicken of the Sea, Red Lobster and U.S. Pet Nutrition, among other companies. In-Gu Park, acting president of South Korea-based Dongwon Enterprise, which owns StarKist, and Chris Lischewski, president and CEO of San Diego-based BumbleBee also were named in the court records. Although fewer Americans eat tuna every year, it's still a mainstay in most kitchens and the country's favorite type of fish. Canned tuna was popularized during World War 1, when it was a convenient protein for troops who returned home and continued to ask for it. Last week in the criminal case in San Francisco, Bumble Bee Foods said it would plead guilty to a felony charge of conspiring to fix the prices of canned and pouched tuna, and pay a $25 million fine. The announcement came after two Bumble Bee executives, senior vice-presidents Ken Worsham and Walter Scott Cameron, also pleaded guilty. They agreed to cooperate with authorities in the ongoing investigation, and face jail time and fines. The FBI and Justice Department said their investigation into packaged seafood is aimed at protecting consumers who deserve competitive prices.

Fowler/The State Journal-Register via AP   Kerry Lester Follow @kerrylester     Former Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn wanted his official portrait to include far more than his smiling image, wearing his lucky purple-and-navy striped tie. He gave Arlington Heights artist William Chambers 44 different items to include in the portrait -- among them, a snapshot of his parents on their wedding day, a photo of his swearing-in to replace impeached and removed Gov. Rod Blagojevich, a family Bible, and a cup with a picture of the Stan Musial Bridge near St. Louis. Including personal objects is a technique of Chambers', who has completed portraits of director Steven Spielberg, President Bill Clinton, and former governors Jim Thompson and Jim Edgar. But 44 items was unusual. "I did tell him, 'Don't forget, the portrait is of you. These are all supporting casts,'" Chambers said. Chambers didn't want the mementos to distract from the main focus of the portrait, the 41st governor. In the end, he resorted to buying a bookshelf from Wal-Mart to stage the items in, portraying Quinn as if he was standing before an office display of his favorite things. Arranging the 44 items -- many of which Chambers still has in his office -- was one thing. Rearranging them was another. Over multiple lunches at the Kerryman, a Chicago Irish pub where Quinn keeps a regular table, the two went over details of the portrait as Quinn requested more and more items be added. "Clients know that they do have the opportunity to add or subtract," Chambers said. "And he was always adding things. At the last minute, he was adding his clipboard. So then I rearranged two books to fit that in there." The clipboard, Quinn said, was a nod to his days as a community organizer. He noted it "can be used as a crowbar by people who need leverage against public servants who have lost their way."   Arlington Heights artist Bill Chambers in his home studio. - Kerry Lester | Staff Photographer Nearly two years ago, Chambers said, Quinn and his longtime girlfriend Monica Walker traveled to Arlington Heights and rang the bell of Chambers' home, situated in a quiet cul-de-sac off Algonquin Road. It's the home where Chambers and his late wife, Grace, raised their four children, and where one son and several grandchildren are still living as they look for a new home. The modest colonial looks like many others from the outside, but a few steps inside the foyer reveal many of Chambers' award-winning pieces, including one of his son Patrick, now a special-education teacher at York High School in Elmhurst. The work won the International Portrait Society of America's International Portrait Competition's People's Choice Award in 1999. After having Quinn sit for a photo shoot -- Chambers typically takes more than 100 shots of a subject in order to capture the most natural poses -- the artist set to work. He first sketched a close-up of Quinn's face, as well as a smaller rendering of the official portrait, before presenting it to Quinn. "I get an idea of exactly what they're looking for. Then I'm not guessing," Chambers said. Key to the portrait was a family Bible that Quinn is seen holding in his right hand. "I asked Monica what the length of the spine of the Bible was. It turned out to be 5¾ inches," Chambers said. "Once I knew that, everything else could be worked out." Unbeknown to him, Chambers said, Quinn was planning to use the 44 background items in an interactive capacity at www.governorquinnportrait.org, where visitors can click on an item and learn about the hallmarks of the governor's time in office. The portrait, paid for with private funds and donations, is thought to have cost at least $15,000, though Quinn and Chambers have not revealed the price. Chambers also recalled last-minute changes with Republican former Gov. Jim Edgar's portrait. Edgar and his wife, Brenda, decided to change out what Chambers calls a "simple, Venetian painting" in the background with a more complicated one depicting a Lincoln-Douglas debate with about 50 people in it. Just before the governor's portrait was finished, Chambers said, the Edgars asked that two of the children in the background painting be made to look like their grandchildren. "My experience, professionally, is that the client is paying for this, and I want them to be happy. But I always try to steer it in such a way that it all works compositionally," he said. Before his career as a portrait painter, Chambers was a successful illustrator and often exhibited in the prestigious Annual of the New York Society of Illustrators. He spent time training with other portrait artists and went to Northeastern University to earn his teaching certificate, should he ever need a backup career. Quinn's portrait was finished just four weeks ago, Chambers said. The unveiling date of May 8 was set after two previous dates were scratched. Chambers traveled to Springfield dressed in his usual work attire -- a flannel shirt and jeans -- to make sure the portrait was set up correctly. He changed into dress clothes in Secretary of State Jesse White's office. When the ceremony started, Chambers said, "I didn't know where I was supposed to be, so I just stayed by Jesse (White)'s office. Then the governor called me up, and his son David and I unveiled it. It's not like I mind my name being mentioned, but I don't necessarily have to be up there," he said. "Some people are gifted, they like being in the limelight. I don't."

(AP Photo/Caleb Jones, File)  (The Associated Press) Previous Next BANGKOK –  Major retailers are taking aim at the most popular tuna brands in the U.S. — Chicken of the Sea, Bumble Bee and StarKist — saying they conspired to keep prices high for consumers. Criminal and civil court records updated this week show dozens of tuna executives are alleged to have engaged in price fixing. A lawsuit filed by Wal-Mart targets some of the wealthiest businessmen in Thailand, where Chicken of the Sea's parent company Thai Union is based. The Department of Justice has been investigating the allegations against the three companies, which combined supply about 80 percent of the $1.7 billion of canned tuna sold annually in the United States, since 2015. Companies that responded said they could not comment citing ongoing litigation.

In some parts of the country Asda, which has a superstore and petrol station in Plymouth, has already stopped selling potatoes, carrots, apples and other items loose by weight. The Wall-Mart owned retail giant's move comes as many people are trying to cut down on food waste and the use of plastic packaging, and has sparked an angry backlash on Twitter, reports The Sun. In 2015, households binned £13 billion worth of food that could have been eaten - and the average household wastes around £470 worth of food in one year - says waste and recycling advisory body Wrap. Last year, Sainsbury's supported Plymouth in the city's bid to reduce food waste by 50 per cent. Plymouth and Truro joined a number of UK cities on Sainsbury's latest mission to count the amount of food being wasted by 50 per cent. The scheme, Waste Less Save More, was the first time UK communities have rallied together and worked with a huge supermarket chain. Asda's decision, which means most of its fruit and veg will now be sold in plastic bags, comes after the Government introduced a 5p tax on carrier bags to reduce their use - and there have even been calls for a tax on takeaway coffee cups. Last year, Government minister Rory Stewart said the Government could move to impose a tax on takeaway coffee cups to discourage their use and reduce waste. Theoretically, the move could work in a similar way to the 5p plastic bag tax - and could see coffee drinkers encouraged to carry their own refillable mugs to save a few pennies and the environment. The announcement came after it was revealed just one in 400 coffee cups are recycled each year. And, also last year, Plymouth scientists were left in shock after finding large amounts of damaging microplastics hundreds of miles from land. Concerns about the effect of small fragments of plastic on the marine environment has prompted the Government to ban their use in cosmetics from 2020 Read next...

Criminal and civil cases allege executives at the largest canned tuna companies were agreeing to collectively raise prices and limit promotions. Major retailers are taking aim at the most popular tuna brands in the U.S. - Chicken of the Sea, Bumble Bee and StarKist - saying they conspired to keep prices high for consumers. (AP Photo/Caleb Jones, File) Updated at 5:14 a.m. BANGKOK • Executives of the most popular tuna brands in the U.S. — Chicken of the Sea, Bumble Bee and StarKist — conspired regularly to keep prices high for consumers with a taste for one of America's favorite sandwich ingredients, according to criminal and civil court records updated this week. A typical can of tuna today costs about $1.50 and the U.S. Department of Justice says that price may be the result of price fixing by Thai, South Korean and U.S. seafood dealers, while major retailers are suing alleging they've been ripped off. The U.S. government began investigating criminal price fixing between the three companies more than two years ago. Together the companies supply about 80 percent of the $1.7 billion of canned tuna sold annually in the United States, according to the court records. Following up, Walmart and other top retailers filed civil lawsuits. +1  Those cases were updated this week with an appendix first reported by Undercurrent News that singles out dozens of tuna executives, roping in some of the wealthiest businessmen in Thailand, where Chicken of the Sea's parent company Thai Union is based. "Thai Union does not comment on ongoing legal matters," the company said in a statement. The other firms did not respond immediately for requests for comment. The litigation describes regular telephone calls and meetings where "executives agreed that all three companies would collective raise prices." They also agreed to "limit promotions and packaged tuna that undercut their published pricing," according to court records.

Check our People in Business See how St. Louis stocks are faring Get the Bottom Line from Nicklaus and Gallagher Thai Union's president and CEO Thiraphong Chansiri, his father Kraisorn Chansiri and dozens of other Thai and American executives are now identified specifically in the ongoing case. Thai Union owns Chicken of the Sea, Red Lobster and U.S. Pet Nutrition, among other companies. In-Gu Park, acting president of South Korea-based Dongwon Enterprise, which owns StarKist, and Chris Lischewski, president and CEO of San Diego-based BumbleBee also were named in the court records. Although fewer Americans eat tuna every year, it's still a mainstay in most kitchens and the country's favorite type of fish. Canned tuna was popularized during World War 1, when it was a convenient protein for troops who returned home and continued to ask for it. Last week in the criminal case in San Francisco, Bumble Bee Foods said it would plead guilty to a felony charge of conspiring to fix the prices of canned and pouched tuna, and pay a $25 million fine. The announcement came after two Bumble Bee executives, senior vice-presidents Ken Worsham and Walter Scott Cameron, also pleaded guilty. They agreed to cooperate with authorities in the ongoing investigation, and face jail time and fines. The FBI and Justice Department said their investigation into packaged seafood is aimed at protecting consumers who deserve competitive prices.

By Glenn Hunter Published in D CEO May 2017 Twenty-one months after the new East Dallas shopping center was announced, its site at the northwest corner of Northwest Highway and Abrams Road remains a rough-looking expanse of weeds, broken glass, cracked asphalt, and uneven concrete slabs. For some reason, a couple of 18-wheelers were parked the other day at the 13-plus-acre site, which was distinguished mainly for its forest of tall, skinny light poles stretching almost as far as the eye could see. Two wooden real estate signs had also been erected on the property, touting a new shopping center that would be called High Point Crossing. The signs said that 275,000 square feet of space was for lease, and suggested that interested parties call a couple of brokers, Jeff Kittleson and Robert Aycock, with CBRE. The signs also proclaimed that the center was a project of The Ainbinder Co., in consultation with one Brian Glaser. Since my wife and I have lived for 18 years across Abrams Road from the property, in the Merriman Park/University Manor residential development, I decided to phone everyone listed on the sign, because this looked like a great story that was right in my own backyard. “Urban in-fill” projects like High Point Crossing are all the rage in real estate these days, after all. But, that’s when I discovered that when commercial property execs don’t want to talk about something, they can clam up tighter than the people who guard KFC’s chicken recipe. None returned my calls. “We’re excited to see the activity there. It can be a little scary at night now, so we think it’s going to be a positive.” Robyn Flatt, co-founder of the Dallas Children’s Theater A major retail center at the corner of Abrams and Northwest Highway would be a big deal for our neighborhood, which has been gradually evolving over time. It wasn’t that long ago, for example, that there was a low-rent strip club called the Doll’s House near the intersection’s northeast corner. (Today it’s a pawn shop.) About half a mile north on Abrams, past the Sable Ridge and Willow Pond apartment complexes, there used to be a number of check-cashing joints and discount liquor stores. Some are still there, at or near the corner of Abrams and Skillman Street, but the neighborhood in general has been trending upscale. For instance, a new, state-of-the-art Alamo Drafthouse theater-restaurant-bar—the third to open in North Texas—is going into the former Tom Thumb space at the old Skillman Abrams Shopping Center, which is being renamed Creekside. There’s also a popular Topgolf location just across the street from Creekside on Park Lane. It’s not too far from a SuperTarget, a Home Depot, and the Timber Creek Crossing shopping center. The nearly 500,000-square-foot Timber Creek center, off Northwest Highway and Skillman, is anchored by a Wal-Mart, a Sam’s Club, and a J.C. Penney. The High Point Crossing property, meantime, backs up to the aforementioned Willow Pond apartments to the north, and to the Dallas Children’s Theater—formerly Don Carter’s All Star Lanes bowling alley—to the west. High Point also sits just across Northwest Highway from the 55-year-old, 319,000-square-foot Medallion Shopping Center, which is anchored by Kohl’s and yet another Target store. There, on the southwest corner of Northwest and Abrams, Medallion is adding a new CVS Pharmacy where an old oil-changing place used to be, says Cherise Fleming, an associate broker with Venture Commercial Real Estate. The CVS should be open around year’s end. High Point Crossing itself is located on property that, until 2008, was the flagship store for the Steakley Chevrolet auto dealership. Before John Steakley came along to open the location in the early 1960s, though, the site had a far different use. My wife, who grew up in Dallas’ Turtle Creek area, remembers the Steakley land as the place her parents used to take her for “pony rides”—a dusty, racetrack-like setup where you could climb aboard one of maybe a dozen little horses. John Steakley’s daughter, Anne Steakley Reeder, recalls the Northwest Highway property like this: “When we moved to Dallas, my dad said, ‘Here’s where the dealership will be.’ It was open 24 hours a day, seven days a week. When Neiman Marcus opened their store at NorthPark, their ads said, ‘Just down the street from Steakley Chevrolet.’” The Steakley site was sold two years ago by an East Coast investor to Ainbinder, a Houston-based real estate developer that, according to a 2015 Dallas Morning News story, has redeveloped similar auto dealerships in the Bayou City. The News account added that Glaser, of Dallas-based Glaser Retail Partners, had brought the deal to Ainbinder and had been approaching potential tenants for High Point Crossing. On its website, Ainbinder as recently as mid-March was describing High Point Crossing as a “vertical urban power center” with retail stores on two levels, plus a multi-level parking structure. However, in a December 2016 “master site plan” drawn up by the Boucher Design Group of Bellaire, Texas, and obtained by D CEO, parking for 831 cars did not seem to include any parking structure. And, the “building area” was just 170,000-some square feet. The December plan also indicated a 62,943-square-foot lease labeled “Academy,” a 15,000-square-foot lease labeled “Party City,” a 20,000-square-foot lease labeled “Marshalls,” and a 20,000-square-foot lease labeled “Ross.” The site plan also showed a proposed new traffic signal on Northwest Highway for drivers entering and exiting High Point Crossing, well west of the corner with Abrams. That’s important, because Abrams’ intersection with Northwest Highway can already be a backed-up nightmare at rush hour. Indeed, traffic counts show more than 56,000 vehicles per day going east and west through the intersection. That’s about 4,700 more vehicles than roll through the super-busy Preston/Northwest Highway corner, near the Dallas North Tollway. City Councilman Mark Clayton, whose District 9 includes High Point Crossing, says that he’s “always concerned about traffic.” He says the proposed new traffic light will help, though, adding, “You’re never going to eliminate traffic on Northwest Highway. But a traffic plan is in place.” Robyn Flatt, co-founder of the Dallas Children’s Theater, has a different concern about the new development. That’s because it would eliminate a connecting road, called Quality Lane, that currently allows patrons to access her facility from Northwest Highway via Theater Way. “We’re very concerned about our staff and patrons having access to [the theater], especially when the weather’s not good,” Flatt says. “So, we’re working with [Ainbinder and the city] to maintain a ‘back door,’ so we’ll be able to get in and out. Safety is our biggest concern.” As a show of good will, perhaps, the developer has already agreed to pay for two big DCT signs that will go up on Flatt’s theater building—one sign facing west, the other looking south. “They want to be good neighbors, and we’re excited to see the activity there,” Flatt says. “It can be a little scary at night now, so we think it’s going to be a positive.” That’s the same way many residents of our neighborhood seem to be viewing the in-fill project. When I asked for comments about High Point Crossing—as well as the new Creekside center—on the Nextdoor website, the response was overwhelmingly bullish. The vacant Steakley site has been “an eyesore for a long time,” one resident wrote. Added another: “These two developments follow a long, stagnant period for our area, during which we all worried about our safety and property values. These positive improvements will be supported by the demographics, which improve each year. … While some are concerned about traffic congestion, that’s the price we’ll all pay, along with higher property taxes.” As for High Point’s expected retail tenants, there’s been only a little grumbling. Damon Dattalo, a Realtor with Keller Williams Urban Dallas, wrote on his blog that “many residents are disappointed this site did not find a more creative use.” He explained further when I phoned him. “East Dallas is not a big fan of suburban sprawl,” Dattalo said. High Point Crossing “looks like it will be nice, but there’s a strip center across the street, and a strip center across Skillman. So it’s going to be more of the same.” For many in our neighborhood, more of the same will be good enough.  Business Commercial Real Estate East Dallas Most Popular Hot Property: Bachelorette Jojo Fletcher’s Dallas Home By Caitlin Clark Owner of Plano's Poor Richard’s Café Arrested for Possession of Child Pornography By Nancy Nichols Richard Butterly, Busted for Child Porn, Kept Working at Poor Richard's By Joshua Baethge Legacy West Announces Grand Opening Weekend Activities By Catherine Downes This East Texas House Is a Dream Home Come True By Ryan Conner Our D CEO Weekly newsletter helps you stay up to speed with breaking news, interviews with industry leaders, and market insights from the editors of D CEO.

A “vertical urban power center” sounds (and looks) much different than a handful of discount clothing and retail stores… not unlike the dealership turned furniture store that they demolished. Neighbors need to hold developers accountable and demand more. Mark Schellhammer I live in Merriman Park, for the last 5 years, moved here from Rockwall. Lived in the area all my life, and I remember well the Steakley Chevrolet dealership. I have seen the slow growth. I was hoping that some of the eastward crawl that has impacted the east side of central would impact Creekside. It looks like it might crawl along Park and Five Corners, where I’m already seeing one set of apartments there with a proposed rezoning, but haven’t been able to find out what that is. And the Katy Trail extension will intersect Park Lane on the west side of the equestrian center as it extends from Northwest Highway and over Skillman. I was hoping for a typical setup with retail and landscaping and water at the ground level with upscale residences at least a couple of stories, like west village or the project at Skillman and Walnut Hill. If it’s going to end up like Medallion Center across the street, this I think it will be more of the same, and that will be a shame to waste the opportunity that corner has to be a catalyst adjoining the new apartments that went up at NW Highway and West Lawther. It would make a great beginning for the renovation of that intersection. Of course part of the updating issue is the Keller’s. How do you update a national landmark? I hope the developers reconsider the use of the corner, especially since it sits so high with a great view. Brian H This project seems stuck in the mud. Other projects that came along after High Point was announced are much farther along in development. The new CVS, Alamo Drafthouse, LH Town Center, The Hill @ US-75 and Walnut Hill are examples. I appreciate the added back story about the property itself, but it seems the TLDR (Too Long Didn’t Read) synopsis of this article would be, “The developers of the project were contacted, and no one responded. No new info at this time.” D Magazine Partners 750 North St.Paul St. Suite 2100 Dallas, Texas 75201 Tel: 214.939.3636 Fax: 214.748.4579 CONTACT US Sections FrontBurner Food & Drink Arts & Entertainment Nightlife Home & Design Shopping & Fashion Health & Fitness Business & Economy Weddings Publications D Magazine D Home D CEO Subscribe Renew Subscriber Services Company Info About Us Masthead Job Openings Internships Awards Customer Service Advertise Media Kits Events Case Studies Contact Us Connect Facebook Twitter Instagram Pinterest YouTube LinkedIn Google+ Copyright © 2017, D Magazine Partners, Inc.

Pool photo via Bradenton Herald Crime May 16, 2017 5:51 AM Shooter thought his wife was having an affair with the pastor, prosecutor says BY JESSICA DE LEON jdeleon@bradenton.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story BRADENTON Andres “Andy” Avalos Jr. believed his wife was having an affair with a local pastor when he killed them both, State Attorney Ed Brodsky said Monday during opening statements of Avalos’ capital murder trial. And his neighbor just showed up at the wrong place at the wrong time when Avalos killed her, Brodsky added. Testimony got underway Monday morning in the trial of Avalos, charged with three counts of first-degree murder in the Dec. 4, 2014, killings of his wife Amber Avalos, 33; neighbor Denise Potter, 46; and the Rev. James “Tripp” Battle III, 31. If Avalos is convicted on any of the first-degree murder charges, the state will seek the death penalty. His attorneys have mounted an insanity defense. To be successful, they will have to prove Avalos did not understand what he did was wrong or that it was criminal or morally wrong. The prosecutor’s opening remarks, as well as testimony from several sheriff’s deputies and crime scene technicians, offered the most detailed account of what happened on the day of the slayings, the possible motive and the subsequent 51-hour manhunt for Avalos. Brodsky told the 14 jurors — made up of 10 women and 4 men, including two alternates — that the evidence in the prosecution’s case would detail the “three moments in time” when Avalos killed the three victims in a jealous rage. Amber Avalos was found in a back room of the couple’s Bradenton home, her head and torso suspended with a cord tied to a cabinet, according to Brodsky. She had multiple blunt force trauma injuries to her face, a swollen eye, major swelling to the rest of her face and bruising to her scalp and the side of her head. Avalos had shot her once, Brodsky said. Potter was found lying on her side in the hallway. She had been shot five times. The couple’s then 4-year-old child had been home and was playing video games when Avalos killed his wife, according to Brodsky. When the boy asked where his mother was, Avalos told the boy, “She was gone.” But the boy did see his mother’s body before his father announced it was time for him to go to school, the prosecutor stated. Defense attorney Richard Watts told jurors that Avalos believed his wife had brought the streets into their home and was having affairs with rival gang members. He conceded that Avalos had hit his wife so hard it left her unconscious and then he killed her. “He had to fight for his life,” Watts said. As Avalos was loading his son into his vehicle, Potter showed up at the home. The two women worked together cleaning houses, so Avalos knew she would find his wife’s body and he wasn’t ready for the police to be called yet — so he went inside and shot and killed her, Brodsky said. After dropping his son at daycare and dumping his SUV at the Walmart on State Road 64 in an effort to continue avoiding detection, Avalos took a taxi cab to Bayshore Baptist Church on U.S. 41, the state attorney said. When Avalos got to the church, Battle was not there. Battle’s wife was in the church office, however, and Avalos began telling her how he believed their spouses were having an affair with one another, Brodsky said. Then she watched as Avalos walked out and shot her husband dead. Avalos went into hiding in the woods behind the Pine Haven Mobile Home Park, just blocks from the church, before reemerging two days later on the wooden deck at a couple’s mobile home. Brodsky told jurors they would hear from them how he admitted to being the person who killed “those people” that they had probably heard about. They prayed with him, fed him and allowed him to call his mother, Brodsky said. Avalos asked for beer before leaving — knowing it was the last chance to have one. And after he left, the couple called 911 and then drove to the Manatee County Sheriff’s Office to report what happened, Brodsky said. A caravan of deputies and detectives arrived at the mobile home to find Avalos drinking, with his .45 automatic caliber pistol at his side. In testimony, Avalos’ uncle, sheriff’s office Lt. Joel Perez, recalled how Avalos had called him just after the slayings. “He just wanted to let me know that he left two bodies at his house for me,” Perez testified. His nephew said he was serious and that he didn’t want his kids to see the bodies when they got home from school, Perez said. “I was drawn back,” Perez said under questioning by Assistant State Attorney Art Brown. “I didn’t ask him any more questions.” He would talk to his nephew again two days later, just as he was about to be arrested. He would speak to him a third time when lead homicide detectives Jeffrey Bliss and John Kenney called him while they were interviewing Avalos. Perez testified he did not think Amber Avalos was having an affair with Battle, despite what Andy Avalos had told him numerous times in the months leading up to the killings. After he testified, Perez sat in the courtroom next to Avalos’ parents, his sister Nora Avalos and Andres Avalos Sr. Nora Avalos was absent from the courtroom when Perez took the stand, however. On the other side of the courtroom were members of the Battle family and Amber Avalos’ family. Jurors saw photographs of both crime scenes during the testimony of several sheriff’s office crime scene technicians. Amber Avalos — whose body was mangled and nearly unrecognizable — was half-suspended in the home’s laundry room, surrounded by a mess of laundry. Potter was seen lying face down in the home’s hallway, purse still in hand. Battle was seen lying not far from the church office door. Teachers at the Happy Cubs Daycare, where the couple’s then 4-year-old attended preschool, testified about their encounter with Avalos when he dropped the boys off, after having already murdered the women, according to prosecutors. Joanne Gartley, one of the teachers, made a comment to the boy about being late, to which Avalos said, “Is that a problem. Am I in trouble?” His tone of voice was louder than usual, she said. She agreed when asked by defense attorney Andrew Crawford that Avalos seemed nervous, antsy and paranoid. Avalos had five beers before deputies and detectives with the sheriff’s office arrived at the mobile home to arrest him, Deputy Joshua Escher testified. Avalos cooperated during his arrest, for which Escher thanked him, he said. “He said he had thought about going a different way, but thought otherwise,” Escher said.

(REUTERS/Stephane Mahe) Share Written by Sarah Kessler Obsession Machines with Brains May 16, 2017 GE recently appointed an executive to head up its efforts in “the future of work.” Her first task will be to figure out what, exactly, that means. The executive, Lynn Calpeter, is a 30-year GE veteran who was most recently the vice president and chief financial officer of GE Power. Her new position was announced in an internal email this March. Susan Peters, GE’s head of human resources, described the role as experimental and wide-ranging, saying it could potentially influence everything from programs to re-skill employees to how GE uses data to understand its workforce. “It would be wonderful to be able to push the ‘easy’ button and say, ‘this is what the future of work is,’” she said. “One of the reasons we put Lynn and this small group together is to parse out a cleaner definition. That’s what they’re working on right now.” She said the role may or may not be permanent, depending on a preliminary “sprint” of research and analysis that will end this summer. The “future of work” has become a hot topic as Donald Trump attacks US companies for moving jobs elsewhere and workers question how automation technology will impact their jobs. Sprint, Amazon, General Motors, Wal-Mart, and Apple were just a handful of companies to promote their US jobs after Trump took office. Few companies have publicly addressed how technology, rather than outsourcing, has impacted their workforces, but the Obama White House, McKinsey, and the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine have tackled the question in reports released over the last six months. Denice Biocca, the leader of GE’s human resources for manufacturing and sourcing, compared the “future of work” effort led by Calpeter to the early stages of GE’s “Ecomagination,”a marketing campaign and corporate strategy GE CEO Jeff Immelt rolled out as climate change was becoming a political and public relations focus 12 years ago. After launching the Ecomagination campaign around GE’s commitment to the environment, GE continued to make coal-related investments and build power plants. “I don’t want to change the economic flow of the company,” Immelt explained in 2007. But it also cut greenhouse gas emissions and fresh water use across its operations and sought out opportunities for environmentally friendly products. Some of these, like solar panels, wind turbines, and lower-emission locomotives, were already GE products in which the company continued to invest. Newly labeled and new “Ecomagination” products (some of which are not so obviously “green”) have generated $270 billion in revenues since 2005. “When we started rolling out Ecomagination,” Biocca said, “Jeff would get out there publicly and say, ‘green is green.’ So we’re not out there doing environmentally friendly things because we’re a good citizen—that’s part of it—but also we’re making money,” she said. “[Calpeter’s task] is to make sure that the future of work is actually a good investment.” Biocca says those investments include technology, re-skilling efforts, and culture. An employer of more than 300,000 people worldwide, GE’s workforce needs are evolving. The company no longer makes home appliances, but it does make a software operating system. On GE factory floors, new tools such as additive manufacturing, the industrial internet, and machines that more fully automate repetitive tasks all require new types of skills to operate. GE has spent $4 billion developing digital products, some of which make it possible to do more work with fewer people. GE has addressed its changing mix of jobs with advertisements aimed at recruiting workers who have digitally-focused skills, an online training program aimed at updating skills for manufacturing workers, and lots and lots of talk about the “future of work.” Long before GE began using the “future of work” buzzphrase, it was also promoting technical careers to students. Workers at GE Aviation’s plant in Lafayette, Indiana, volunteer to read to grade school students and stay on the clock. In Asheville, North Carolina, GE Aviation is one of the local manufacturers that participates in an internship program for high school students. More recently, the GE Foundation ran a pilot with Boston Public Schools in 2016 that brought a traveling lab with technology like 3D printers, laser cutters, and milling machines to schools. Calpeter’s background as a CFO, rather than as a human resource professional, makes her an interesting choice for the “future of work” role. Before her recent role as the CFO of GE Power, she was the CFO at NBC Universal (which GE agreed to sell to Comcast in 2009). She has also held financial leadership roles at GE Plastics. Peters said Calpeter’s finance background will be useful in the new role because she has worked across many different GE businesses and has experience spearheading projects. It may also be appropriate because the future of work–whatever it means–will likely have an impact on more than GE’s workforce. GE, like other companies, has political, marketing, and practical incentives to address how work will change in the future. While it may emerge with training, technology, and culture investments, and cohesive narratives around them, it’s unlikely to emerge with all of the answers. As a committee of experts convened by The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine recently concluded in a report about the future of work, researchers don’t even have enough data to fully understand the present.

A dose of inflation, within reason, helps economies grow by boosting company profits -- with textbooks telling us wages should follow -- and makes debt easier to service (at least until interest rates rise). The latest reflation burst was sparked last year by a big turnaround in Chinese factory prices and an improving outlook for global growth. But this may not herald a return to inflation as we once knew it. Unlike previous cycles when prices accelerated and policy makers had to step in and cool demand, a damper this time around is the dizzying pace of innovations in the retail sector. The rise of online shopping and price comparison websites has hooked consumers on discounts. And even when people tear themselves from their screens and actually make it to the shops, fewer staff and less glitzy stores are keeping prices down there too. It’s a development that economists at an Australian bank have dubbed the “Aldi-isation effect” after the German discount supermarket known for its no-frills approach. “The cutting edge of retail will continue to increase price competition and thus carry a deflationary drag,” said Richard Yetsenga, who is the Sydney-based chief economist at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. “The ‘Aldi-isation’ trend is here to stay.” The 2017 Total Retail report from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP found that 47 percent of the 24,471 respondents surveyed across the globe use Amazon.com as a research site for prices. Japan, Germany, Brazil and the U.S. were found to be the top four countries where consumers shop less often at brick-and-mortar stores due to the "Amazon effect." “Competition has never been fiercer,” said John Maxwell, global retail & consumer leader at the consultancy. The results can be seen around the world. In the U.S., the consumer price index for apparel has been going nowhere, as the chart below illustrates: Discounting is probably playing a role in holding down retail wages too, at least in the U.S. where the retail category shows the smallest 12-month wage gain of all sectors tracked in the monthly U.S. employment report, according to NatWest Markets. Read more here about how Coke is hurting from the switch to online shopping Japan’s central bank is desperately trying to stoke inflation, warning last month that cheap mobile phone handsets and connection fees are weighing on the consumer price index. The bank attributed this to intensified competition from virtual network operators. Reflation Trade The most important market news of the day. Get our markets daily newsletter. Sign Up Investors have been scaling back their optimism on inflation picking up since the start of the year. The global bond market measures price-growth expectations through breakeven rates, which is the yield spread between sovereign debt and inflation-protected securities with a similar maturity. While still up from year ago levels, breakeven rates in Group of Seven countries have fallen from peaks earlier in 2017. In the U.S., the 10-year breakeven rate is about 1.9 percentage points, down from a 2017-high of 2.09 percentage points in January. It’s 1.16 percentage points in Germany and 0.46 percentage points in Japan, both down from earlier this year. Internet Disruption Jack Ma, Chairman of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., has warned of decades of pain as the Internet disrupts economies. China’s consumer prices climbed 1.2 percent in April, less than half the government’s target of around 3 percent, even as data from the nation’s dominant bank card network and No. 2 e-commerce platform JD.com Inc show consumption remains buoyant. Aldi is planning its biggest remodeling investment ever in the U.S. in a bid to steal market share from big supermarket chains. At the same time, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. is ramping up its e-commerce operations. The American retail industry started off the year closing brick-and-mortar stores at a record pace, according to Credit Suisse estimates. In Canada, the country’s largest grocer is braced for a prolonged period of food deflation. Loblaw Cos. is fighting a price war with Wal-Mart, Metro Inc. and others as they race to offer discounts. “I can’t remember any retailer I’ve talked to who is counting on inflation helping them out,” said Erik Gordon, a professor at the Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, who has been covering retail trends for almost 30 years. “They’re all looking for ways to cut costs, because they’re expecting it to get worse. They’re not expecting it to get better.” To be sure, competition among retailers isn’t new and the picture for inflation globally varies regionally and is impacted by a number of forces. Volatile food and energy prices are crucial swing factors, especially in emerging markets. On the supply side, prices for manufactured goods aren’t going anywhere fast as the next generation of cheap labor economies nip at China’s heals and robots replace workers in economies with higher labor costs, allowing them to become competitive again. Developed nations have for years flirted with deflation for reasons that had less to do with online shopping and more to do with tepid underlying economies, which are grayer and aren’t enjoying the fruits of a burgeoning consumer class.  Restrained credit growth from companies and consumers still scarred by the crisis has also damped demand. That means less cash is chasing goods and services in the real economy -- which tells you all you need to know about today’s subdued prices according to monetarist orthodoxy. And that’s where reflationists see things turning around. The world’s biggest central banks are continuing easy policies, while China’s shift from factory deflation to rising prices could start to be shipped around the world as exporters there increase asking prices. Rate Impact Still, the importance of consumption -- it accounted for 58 percent of global GDP in 2015 according to the World Bank -- means sweeping changes in shopping patterns will act as a restraint on the pace of inflation and could be a factor determining how quickly central banks tighten should global growth continue to perk up. The International Monetary Fund is projecting average inflation in the G-7 will be sub-2 percent in the medium-term horizon. While that’s better than the sub-1 percent inflation in 2015 and 2016, it’s below most central bank inflation targets. Back in Australia, more competition is on the way with Amazon.com Inc due to expand operations in the country this year. “We are expecting a general global trend to higher interest rates over the next couple of years,” said Yetsenga. “But Aldi-isation suggests the move will be slow.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

X Jeff Bezos of Amazon has the last laugh – and he’s earned it Lots of people hate Bezos, but to do so is to misunderstand what innovation looks like Tue, May 16, 2017, 07:40 Andrew Ross Sorkin Jeff Bezos: has succeeded enough to outweigh his failures. Photograph: Alex Wong/Getty Images         Twenty years ago this week, Amazon. com">Amazon.com went public. Sceptics of Jeff Bezos, the company’s founder, have spent the better part of the past two decades second-guessing and vilifying him: He has been described as “a monopolist”, “literary enemy No 1”, “a notorious international tax dodger”, impossible, a ruthless boss and – more than once – Lex Luthor. His company used to routinely be described as Amazon.con. But you know what? Here we are, 20 years later, and Bezos has an authentic, legitimate claim on having changed the way we live. He has changed the way we shop. He has changed the way companies use computers, by moving much of their information and systems to cloud services. He has even changed the way we interact with computers by voice: “Alexa!” Along the way he has bought – and fixed – the Washington Post, one of the nation’s premier journalistic institutions. And through his aerospace company, Blue Origin, he has invested billions of dollars in the race to space, a one-time hobby that, if successful, could change the world much more profoundly than free one-day shipping. I did not think he was going to succeed on the scale that he has – Warren Buffett on Jeff Bezos Even Warren Buffett was sceptical of Amazon way back when. “I was too dumb to realise what was going to happen,” he said at the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting this month. “I’ve admired Jeff, and I’ve admired him for a long, long time. But I did not think he was going to succeed on the scale that he has. We missed it entirely.” He called Bezos’s work “a remarkable business achievement”, saying, “One person has built an extraordinary economic machine in two pretty different industries almost simultaneously, from a standing start at zero, with competitors with lots of capital and everything else”. Buffett’s partner, Charles T Munger, put it this way: “Jeff Bezos is a different species.” Loss after loss Today Amazon’s valuation is $464 billion – twice the value of Wal-Mart. If you had invested $10,000 at the IPO, you’d have nearly $5 million today. Sometimes praise is due. And he is clearly having a moment. Perhaps the most surprising thing Bezos was able to accomplish, despite his detractors, was to find investors willing to trust him enough to invest in Amazon even as it racked up losses after losses. Most executives are worried about the next quarter, but Bezos is worried about what will happen years from now That’s not to say investors were always happy with Bezos. They would frequently punish his stock, making it seem like a volatile investment. Then, every so often, he would surprise investors with profits, as if to suggest, “Yes, we can make money whenever we want, if we don’t want to invest in the future.” Most executives are worried about the next quarter, but Bezos is worried about what will happen years from now. That is a competitive advantage that many chief executives could learn from. “If everything you do needs to work on a three-year time horizon, then you’re competing against a lot of people,” Bezos told Wired in 2011. Here, he was expressing the view that some chief executives think in three-year cycles – a relatively generous assessment, given that most top executives don’t last many more years than that. “But,” he continued, “if you’re willing to invest on a seven-year time horizon, you’re now competing against a fraction of those people, because very few companies are willing to do that.” To Bezos’s credit, he was always upfront with his ambitions and long-term approach. “Because of our emphasis on the long term, we may make decisions and weigh trade-offs differently than some companies,” he wrote in his first letter to shareholders in 1997. “We aren’t so bold as to claim that the above is the ‘right’ investment philosophy, but it’s ours, and we would be remiss if we weren’t clear in the approach we have taken and will continue to take.” Mobile phone failure None of this is meant to suggest that Bezos is perfect. Far from it. He has repeatedly failed – remember his ill-fated foray into mobile phones? – but he has succeeded enough to outweigh his failures. And along the way, he is likely to fail again, something he says he embraces. Is Bezos an easy boss? Hardly. He is unbelievably demanding. “Amazon is not happening to book-selling,” Bezos has said. “The future is happening to book-selling” But it is difficult to believe that the creative new products Amazon has incubated and introduced could have been born if he were a professional soul-crusher. As an author, I’m supposed to hate Bezos. After all, he has pressured publishers, cut their margins and practically put old-school bookshops out of business. As if to rub it in, he’s now introducing brick-and-mortar Amazon bookshops. But to take that view would be to misunderstand what innovation looks like. It upends industries – witness the current carnage in the retail industry, which has been outmoded by Amazon and all the companies trying to copy it. “Amazon is not happening to book-selling,” Bezos has said, defending his role in a 2013 interview with Charlie Rose. “The future is happening to book-selling.” And the future is now happening to retail stores and even supermarkets – Bezos’s next conquest. And the future is clearly happening to enterprise computing. Bezos has a famous laugh; look it up on YouTube. He has every right to be laughing right now.

A typical can of tuna today costs about $1.50 and the U.S. Department of Justice says that price may be the result of price fixing by Thai, South Korean and U.S. seafood dealers, while major retailers are suing alleging they’ve been ripped off. The U.S. government began investigating criminal price fixing between the three companies more than two years ago. Together the companies supply about 80 percent of the $1.7 billion of canned tuna sold annually in the United States, according to the court records.

Those cases were updated this week with an appendix first reported by Undercurrent News that singles out dozens of tuna executives, roping in some of the wealthiest businessmen in Thailand, where Chicken of the Sea’s parent company Thai Union is based. “Thai Union does not comment on ongoing legal matters,” the company said in a statement. The other firms did not respond immediately for requests for comment. The litigation describes regular telephone calls and meetings where “executives agreed that all three companies would collective raise prices.” They also agreed to “limit promotions and packaged tuna that undercut their published pricing,” according to court records. Thai Union’s president and CEO Thiraphong Chansiri, his father Kraisorn Chansiri and dozens of other Thai and American executives are now identified specifically in the ongoing case. Thai Union owns Chicken of the Sea, Red Lobster and U.S. Pet Nutrition, among other companies. In-Gu Park, acting president of South Korea-based Dongwon Enterprise, which owns StarKist, and Chris Lischewski, president and CEO of San Diego-based BumbleBee also were named in the court records. Although fewer Americans eat tuna every year, it’s still a mainstay in most kitchens and the country’s favorite type of fish. Canned tuna was popularized during World War 1, when it was a convenient protein for troops who returned home and continued to ask for it. Check out Federal News Radio's latest podcasts. Last week in the criminal case in San Francisco, Bumble Bee Foods said it would plead guilty to a felony charge of conspiring to fix the prices of canned and pouched tuna, and pay a $25 million fine. The announcement came after two Bumble Bee executives, senior vice-presidents Ken Worsham and Walter Scott Cameron, also pleaded guilty. They agreed to cooperate with authorities in the ongoing investigation, and face jail time and fines. The FBI and Justice Department said their investigation into packaged seafood is aimed at protecting consumers who deserve competitive prices.
