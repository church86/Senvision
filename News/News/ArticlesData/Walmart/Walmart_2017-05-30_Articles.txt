By Allan Ellinger on May 31, 2017 Share This Article Reddit LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Print Talk Gigi Hadid As the fashion and retail landscape continues to evolve at warp speed, “old guard” vendors and newer digitally native e-commerce companies are rapidly converging at an M&A intersection of mutual need. While online players offer the right combination of technology, data-driven consumer insights and social engagement as well as aesthetics, established, traditionally rooted firms bring operational excellence, product development and sourcing capabilities, in addition to sorely needed working capital. Veteran brands and labels would be wise to find a next-gen partner to intelligently enter the digital fray as it is often cheaper to buy it than to build it. It appears that patience in the venture capital and private equity communities for next-generation fashion and retail-tech companies is waning, given burn rates that are too high and success rates that are too low. As capital is beginning to dry up for still unprofitable e-commerce start-ups, opportunities for strategics will open up at prices worth negotiating. The core competencies of design, manufacturing and sourcing, logistics and importing remain intrinsic to the fashion industry and where — via the right strategic relationship — one can provide digital retailers with much-needed business acumen, a strong balance sheet and leverageable infrastructure. Marc Lore oversees Jet.com and Wal-Mart global e-commerce.  Seth Wenig/AP/REX/Shutterstock Look at the evolving strategies at Wal-Mart, Tommy Hilfiger and PVH. These “old guard” retailers and brands are jumping into this new industry paradigm, risking capital and brand equity for the opportunity to remain viable with new consumers tomorrow. At Wal-Mart, the $3.3 billion Jet.com acquisition brought digital entrepreneur Marc Lore to the retailer, and he is quickly putting his fingerprint on the organization with new acquisitions and hires that position Wal-Mart to better compete digitally with Amazon et al. Lore has been given the necessary autonomy needed to drive a new business model supported by Wal-Mart’s world class logistics and infrastructure. Kudos to Wal-Mart for stepping out of its comfort zone and trying and testing new retail approaches. An intensive focus on social media and a new consumer is at play at PVH’s Tommy Hilfiger. Shifting its operating model to see-now-buy-now, creating the fashion event Tommyland at Venice Beach, leveraging Gigi Hadid’s celebrity power and youth appeal, and employing a digitally focused global media campaign all have amplified the voice and reach of the Tommy Hilfiger brand and altered its business model, better equipping the company to compete as a nimbler, just-in-time, fashion brand. PVH has been active on the acquisition front as well. In March 2017, this 137-year-old apparel company purchased True & Co. a five-year-old born on the web direct-to-consumer e-commerce bra brand, adding to its Calvin Klein, Warner’s and Olga intimates businesses. PVH will now have in-house data analytics that drive True & Co.’s success and can be leveraged across PVH’s brands while providing category expertise, global brand management and supply chain know-how that will support True & Co.’s next leg of growth. Success in today’s fashion industry is increasingly tenuous amid the growing number of store closures and bankruptcies in tandem with the seemingly daily arrival of yet another “fashion tech digital disruptor” and the continuing onslaught of Amazon. This year, many traditional apparel brands and labels will see sales volume decline in tandem with fewer points of distribution and competition from the newest flavor of the day. Even established brands with strong consumer loyalty are navigating a choppy landscape as consumer demands are changing faster than their ability to keep pace. The rate of change is unprecedented and it is working its way through the apparel ecosystem, from design, textile production to assembly and manufacturing, to logistics and distribution and finally to point of sale as digitization impacts the entire supply chain. These challenges and more will increase for the next few years as creative destruction continues. Over the long haul, the digital shift should generate efficiencies that yield enhanced profitability. Opportunities co-exist with these challenges. But, this requires a new framework, out-of-the-box thinking, and a willingness to test and try new business models. The need for a new vision replete with new goals, new brand and marketing strategies and as importantly, new level talent is a must. Internal, radical organizational and cultural change is extremely difficult, it often takes too long and can upset the corporate structure. An alternative route is to find a strategic partner that has the digital know-how and the social media savvy that your business lacks, while offering the depth of industry experience digital disruptors need in order to achieve, profitable growth. The right combinations can supercharge both partners and result in synergies benefiting both parties. This isn’t about next season, or next year. This is about long-term survival. The biggest risk today is to do nothing. Simply put, inactivity or indecision is not a strategy. Allan Ellinger is cofounder and senior managing director of MMG Advisors.

SPENCER SOPER SEATTLE — Bloomberg News Published Tuesday, May 30, 2017 10:05AM EDT Last updated Tuesday, May 30, 2017 5:42PM EDT Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print Amazon.com Inc.’s shares topped $1,000 (U.S.) for the first time, marking a new milestone for a company wooing investors by dominating online commerce and cloud computing, two industries expected to keep growing as shopping habits change and businesses rethink how they deploy technology. Amazon shares touched $1,001.20 in intraday trading Tuesday, up about 40 per cent from a year ago and more than double the 15 per cent gain of the S&P 500 index in the same period, before closing at $996.70. Investors are thinking about how much further Amazon can grow as it tries to replicate its U.S. success abroad. The shares will likely push even higher since Amazon is growing so quickly in massive global industries that show no signs of slowing, said John Blackledge, analyst at Cowen and Co. LLC, who recently upped his Amazon price target to $1,125 a share. “There’s a long runway there,” he said. “The markets Amazon is playing in with global retail and cloud computing are just massive. Things continue to go well and investors are looking for more upside.” The Seattle company’s $477-billion market value is double that of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. even though the world’s biggest retailer will have sales three times larger than Amazon’s this year. Investors put more value in Amazon’s Web traffic and delivery network than they do in Wal-Mart’s vast store presence because online spending will grow more than four times faster than overall retail spending this year as shoppers continue to shift from stores to websites, according to EMarketer Inc. The world’s largest online retailer is dominating e-commerce with its $99-a-year Amazon Prime subscription, which includes delivery discounts, music and video streaming and photo storage that keep shoppers engaged with the website. Seattle-based Amazon had 80 million Prime subscribers in the U.S. as of March 31, an increase of 38 per cent from a year earlier, according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. Prime memberships help lock in loyalty, which is critical as competitors such as Wal-Mart enhance their e-commerce offerings to slow Amazon’s momentum. Amazon has been tackling retail one category at a time, disrupting bookstores and electronics stores first, and more recently pushing into apparel and groceries. Its rise has coincided with the decline of prominent retail chains such as Macy’s Inc. and Sears Holdings Corp., which have shuttered stores and laid off workers in response to declining sales. cloud-computing division Amazon Web Services, which maintains a global network of data centres and rents out storage space and computing functions to clients in a variety of industries, including Netflix Inc. and Airbnb Inc. as well as Capital One Financial Corp. and the U.S. federal government. Yelp runs many of its functions on AWS. This year, companies around the world will funnel $246.8-billion to Amazon and other cloud services providers, according to Gartner Inc., up 18 per cent from 2016. Amazon’s rise has made its founding CEO Jeff Bezos the world’s second-wealthiest person, behind only Microsoft Corp. co-founder Bill Gates, according to the Bloomberg billionaires index. His ascendancy has won praise from fellow self-made billionaires Warren Buffett and Mark Cuban, owner of the Dallas Mavericks and judge on the television show Shark Tank. “Amazon is worth far more than $1,000 a share,” said Mr. Cuban, an Amazon investor. “Consumers always want things at lower prices delivered faster. Amazon uses data better than anyone to achieve those goals for everything it sells. They have a chance to be the most dominant company in the world.” Report Typo/Error   WMT-NWal Mart Stores Inc Latest Price$78.15 0.00 (0.00%) AMZN-QAmazon.com Inc Latest Price$996.70 0.00 (0.00%) Updated May 30 4:00 PM EDT. Delayed by at least 15 minutes.

Even after an online spending spree, it may be hard for Walmart to escape the Amazon in the room. Walmart's acquisition of Jet.com and brands that appeal to younger shoppers have given it an e-commerce boost as it works to close the gap between itself and the online leader. The world's largest retailer is betting on essentials like cereal and diapers, and has adjusted its shipping strategy to better compete with Amazon's Prime program. But Amazon keeps innovating too, implementing new technology and trying to make shopping more convenient. Marc Lore, a co-founder of Jet.com who is now head of Walmart's U.S. online operations, says he's confident about the company's momentum and that there's plenty of room for it to thrive. "I can tell you we are happy with the moves we are making, and we are happy with the results," Lore said at the Jet headquarters in Hoboken, N.J. "It's about moving fast. It's about innovating. And it's a very big market." He noted that e-commerce sales industrywide are still growing 15 percent per year. Lore led Walmart's acquisitions of specialty online retailers like ModCloth, Moosejaw and ShoeBuy.com, and said he's still looking at companies that have expertise in categories where Walmart wants to grow faster. As Walmart prepares to show off some of its innovations this week before its shareholder meeting, there are signs that things are starting to click. Sales at Walmart.com rose 63 percent in the first quarter, up from 29 percent growth in the previous quarter and marking its fourth straight quarter of increases. Walmart said most of the increase was not through acquisitions but was fueled by changes in its shipping strategy and a discount for shoppers who pick up their online orders. Walmart.com now offers 50 million products including those from third-party sellers, up from 10 million a year ago. In comparison, Amazon has hundreds of millions of products. David Spitz, CEO of e-commerce technology company ChannelAdvisor, says for some it has become ingrained they start and finish their shopping at Amazon, and the Prime program reinforces that. He said Walmart wasn't putting an emphasis on keeping up. "If anything, the gap was widening," Spitz said. "Jet.com was intended to be a jolt. Wal-Mart is clearly being more aggressive. There is a sense of urgency, but whether that is enough is the multibillion-dollar question." Amazon accounted for 33 percent of U.S. online sales last year, according to the research firm Euromonitor. Walmart moved into second place ahead of eBay, with 7.8 percent. Greg Melich, an analyst at research firm Evercore, estimates that Amazon customers spend an average of $800 annually on the site, and members of its $99-a-year Prime program spend on average 2.7 times more than others. If Amazon's relationship with Prime members continues to grow, Melich said recently, then Amazon's path toward Walmart's 9 percent of the total U.S. retail market from its current 3 percent is "reasonable." If Lore is worried, he doesn't acknowledge it. "We don't think specifically about Prime at all," he said. "We think we (have) got a customer base — those customers who want to be able to save money and they want to be able to shop in different ways, whether it be direct-to-home, grocery pickup or going to the physical store." Its 4,700 stores are a strength for Walmart, as they buck the larger retail trend in seeing increases in shopper numbers and sales. The discount for store pickup is bringing shoppers in. Walmart says even the expansion of stores with curbside pickup for groceries is also helping, since people often realize they forgot an item or two and run into the store. And as rivals like Target struggle to get their grocery departments right, Wal-Mart is placing a priority on essentials like peanut butter, paper towels and fresh produce that shoppers buy often. Amazon's stores are mainly showcases for gadgets, or are textbook- and furniture-pickup locations aimed at college students. But it keeps innovating, and it's testing an Amazon Go convenience store, where sensors track items as shoppers go and there's no need to check out. Amazon just opened its first bookstore in Manhattan and seventh overall.

Amazon, the internet goliath that revolutionized the way much of the world buys books, toilet paper and TVs, hit a new milestone Tuesday: Its stock surpassed the $1,000 mark for the first time. That price put Amazon's market value at about $478 billion, double that of the world's biggest traditional retailer, Walmart, and more than 15 times the size of Target. A $1,000 investment on Amazon's first day of trading in 1997 would be worth more than $500,000 today. Not only has Amazon changed the retail landscape since it became a public company 20 years ago, it's now part of a small cadre of high-flying stocks belonging to companies that have defied Wall Street and shunned stock splits. Those splits make the stock more affordable and generate brokerage fees. But companies like Amazon have chosen to reward its long-term investors. The last time Amazon has split its stock was nearly 18 years ago, according to financial research firm FactSet. Another company with a similar philosophy is Alphabet Inc., the parent company of Google. Amazon just beat Alphabet to the $1,000 level, with its Class A shares just $2 short of $1,000 on Tuesday. Only four other U.S.-listed companies have shares trading above $1,000: online travel booking company Priceline Group Inc., homebuilder NVR Inc., pork producer and ocean transportation company Seaboard Corp. and the apostle of long-term investing, Warren Buffett, with his holding company Berkshire Hathaway Inc. But stock prices only tell a part of the story. The value of a company is determined by its stock price and the number of shares on the market. Amazon.com is well over four times the size of Priceline, NVR and Seaboard combined. It is 17 percent bigger than Berkshire Hathaway, a multinational conglomerate with ownership stakes in some of America's most well-known consumer brands like Coca-Cola, insurance companies and U.S. infrastructure. Since launching a website to sell mostly books in 1995, Amazon has transfigured retail, sent revenue numbers to stratospheric heights and is among the biggest reasons longtime powerhouses like Macy's, Borders bookstores and even RadioShack have suffered. Those companies are closing locations and Amazon is filling the void, sometimes literally. Last week in a location once occupied by Borders, the bookstore chain that went out of business in 2011, Amazon opened its first bookstore in New York City.

Amazon hit an intraday high of US$1,001.20 in New York before ending the day little changed at US$996.70. The stock is up almost 40 per cent from a year ago and more than double the 15 per cent gain of the S&P 500 Index in the same period. Investors are thinking about how much further Amazon can grow as it tries to replicate its US success abroad. The shares will likely push even higher since Amazon is growing so quickly in massive global industries that show no signs of slowing, as shopping habits change and businesses rethink how they deploy technology, said Mr John Blackledge, analyst at Cowen and Co, who recently upped his Amazon price target to US$1,125 a share. "There's a long runway there," he said. "The markets Amazon is playing in with global retail and cloud computing are just massive. Things continue to go well and investors are looking for more upside." Get The Straits Times newsletters in your inbox Sign Up The Seattle company's US$478 billion (S$660 billion) market value is double that of Walmart Stores even though the world's biggest retailer will have sales three times larger than Amazon's this year. Investors put more value in Amazon's Web traffic and delivery network than they do in Walmart's vast store presence because online spending will grow more than four times faster than overall retail spending this year as shoppers continue to shift from stores to websites, according to EMarketer. The world's largest online retailer is dominating e-commerce with its US$99-a-year Amazon Prime subscription, which includes delivery discounts, music and video streaming and photo storage that keep shoppers engaged with the website. Amazon had 80 million Prime subscribers in the US as of March 31, an increase of 38 per cent from a year earlier, according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. Prime memberships help lock in loyalty, which is critical as competitors such as Walmart enhance their e-commerce offerings to slow Amazon's momentum. Amazon has been tackling retail one category at a time, disrupting bookstores and electronics stores first and more recently pushing into apparel and groceries. Its rise has coincided with the decline of prominent retail chains such as Macy's and Sears Holdings, which have shuttered stores and laid off workers in response to declining sales. Shopping malls have resorted to hosting concerts and carnivals in empty parking lots to keep customers coming. Another Amazon advantage is its profitable and fast-growing cloud-computing division Amazon Web Services, which maintains a global network of data centres and rents out storage space and computing functions to clients in a variety of industries, including Netflix and Airbnb, as well as Capital One Financial Corp and the federal government. Amazon's rise has made its founding chief executive officer Jeff Bezos the world's second wealthiest person, behind only Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. "Amazon is worth far more than US$1,000 a share," said Mr Mark Cuban, owner of the Dallas Mavericks and an Amazon investor. "Consumers always want things at lower prices delivered faster. Amazon uses data better than anyone to achieve those goals for everything it sells. They have a chance to be the most dominant company in the world."

Its stock surpassed the $1,000 mark for the first time. That price puts Amazon's market value at $478 billion, double that of Wal-Mart. ___ BA debacle puts spotlight on airlines' old IT systems, cuts LONDON (AP) — The catastrophic IT failure at British Airways that ruined travel plans for 75,000 people has raised questions about some older airlines' focus on costs to the detriment of investment in new computer systems. As British Airways resumed full service Tuesday, shares in its parent company, International Airlines Group, dropped 3 per cent as investors appeared to worry that the company's quality of service may have been undermined by recent efforts to save money. ___ Men probing Ivanka Trump brands in China arrested, missing SHANGHAI (AP) — An advocacy group says a man investigating allegations of worker abuse at a Chinese company that makes Ivanka Trump-brand shoes has been arrested and two others are missing. China Labor Watch's founder says it's the first time colleagues have ever faced such consequences. ___ Uber fires autonomous car researcher involved in lawsuit DETROIT (AP) — Uber has followed through on threats to fire a star autonomous-car researcher whose hiring touched off a bitter legal fight with Waymo, the former self-driving car arm of Google. Waymo has alleged that Anthony Levandowski downloaded 14,000 documents containing its trade secrets before he left the company to found a startup that was purchased by Uber. ___ US consumer spending, incomes grew solidly in April WASHINGTON (AP) — Americans increased their spending in April at the fastest pace in four months, bolstered by a solid gain in incomes.

The U.S. regulators announced the penalty against Deutsche Bank on Tuesday, citing "unsafe and unsound practices." The action follows $629 million in penalties levied against Deutsche Bank in January by New York state and British regulators for lapses in controls that allowed wealthy Russians to allegedly launder about $10 billion in illicit funds. ___ CBS Entertainment shake-up as Glenn Geller steps down NEW YORK (AP) — CBS on Tuesday announced a new leadership team for its entertainment division.

Casey Ferrand Reporter MINIMUM WAGE: Louisiana won't boost its minimum wage for hourly workers. The House and Senate labor committees rejected bills that would have set the state minimum wage higher than the hourly federal rate of $7.25 and would have allowed local governments to set their own minimum wage. Working women protest and secondline for equal pay  |  Updated: 6:51 PM CDT May 30, 2017   Share Copy Link Copy {copyShortcut} to copy Link copied! Casey Ferrand Reporter NEW ORLEANS — Working women in New Orleans are asking for equal pay for equal work, but Louisiana lawmakers have killed several bills aimed at closing the state's gender pay gap during the current legislative session. Advertisement In Louisiana, women are paid 68 cents for every dollar a man is paid, and the disparity is worse for African-American and Latina women. According to the National Partnership for Women and Families, in Louisiana, the median annual pay for a woman who holds a full-time, year-round job is $31,586. For men, it's $48,382, which means there is a wage gap of about $16,000. Women who gathered to protest and spread the word about their cause said their lower wages means less money to save for the future or to spend on basic goods and services. In early 2017, Walmart, the nation's largest private employer, raised its starting wage from $9 per hour to $10 per hour for new employees. Betsey Marler has worked thereat Walmart for eight years. "The position I'm in, the starting wage is $10.80. So until these past raises in March, I was only making 20 cents more after eight years than a brand-new associate walking in the door," Marler said. She and other women are asking Walmart to be transparent and reveal the average wages for women versus men, to lead the charge for getting equal pay for equal work. "When Walmart raised their starting wage, so did Target, Marshalls and other places. We feel if Walmart will be more transparent and disclose this information, then the other major companies in the nation will do so also," Marler said. Blake Jackson, a Walmart spokesperson, provided a statement saying, "We believe that associates with the same qualifications, making the same effort to achieve the same result should receive the same rate of pay for performing the same work. We've invested $2.7 billion in training, education and higher wages to create paths of opportunity, and we're proud that 57% of the hourly associates who received promotions during the past year were women." Walmart provided this additional information about the company: ·As reported in our 2017 GRR (Global Responsibility Report), women comprise 55 percent of our total U.S. associate population, as well as 57 percent of the hourly-associates associates who were promoted during the past year. · In addition, in our 2017 GRR, we reported that people of color represented about 43 percent of our total U.S. associate population and about 45 percent of the hourly associates in the USU.S. who were promoted last year. People of color also represented about 53 percent of all newly hired associates in the U.S. · Walmart seeks to hire and develop talented people who represent the perspectives and interests of our global customers. · We are proud that women and people of color represent a greater proportion of leadership at Walmart than at other the Fortune 500 companies on average, and we will continue our work to foster development opportunities for all who want to make a career at Walmart. The group is also relying on Louisiana lawmakers to create more legislation to help even the playing field for women, but so far several bills introduced this session have been blocked. "We voted for them to have our back, and they're pretty much failing us because this is something we want and need," Melinda Yonta said. During the current legislative session, legislators have failed to pass three bills, including Senate Bill 2 authored by Sen. J.P. Morrell. It would have extended protections afforded by the Louisiana Pay Act to men and women and clarified how and when workers can sue their employers. Morell said the bill would have provided workers with the tools to address inequities. He plans to file a version of the bill again next year. Earlier this month, lawmakers shot down two other bills that would have narrowed the wage gap. House Bill 112 required companies that have public government contracts to comply with existing equal pay law. House Bill 222 would have prohibited private employers form retaliating against employees who discuss their wages. "It takes us as women and our community people to come out and support us and fight for this so we can win equal pay for equal work," Yonta said. Loading more articles...

By ANNE D'INNOCENZIOAssociated Press Share Comment Read Article Wal-Mart's acquisition of Jet.com is accelerating its progress in e-commerce as it works to narrow the gap with online leader Amazon. But Amazon keeps innovating, too, such as with its experimental Amazon Go convenience stores, currently open only to its employees in Seattle. Associated Press/Jeff Chiu, File HOBOKEN, N.J. — Even after an online spending spree, it may be hard for Wal-Mart to escape the Amazon in the room. Wal-Mart’s acquisition of Jet.com and brands that appeal to younger shoppers have given it an e-commerce boost as it works to close the gap between itself and the online leader. The world’s largest retailer is betting on essentials like cereal and diapers, and has adjusted its shipping strategy to better compete with Amazon’s Prime program. But Amazon keeps innovating too, implementing new technology and trying to make shopping more convenient. Marc Lore, a co-founder of Jet.com who is now head of Wal-Mart’s U.S. online operations, says he’s confident about the company’s momentum and that there’s plenty of room for it to thrive. “I can tell you we are happy with the moves we are making, and we are happy with the results,” Lore said at Jet headquarters in Hoboken, New Jersey. “It’s about moving fast. It’s about innovating. And it’s a very big market.” He noted that e-commerce sales industrywide are still growing 15 percent per year. Lore led Wal-Mart’s acquisitions of specialty online retailers such as ModCloth, Moosejaw and ShoeBuy.com, and said he’s still looking at companies that have expertise in categories where Wal-Mart wants to grow faster. As Wal-Mart prepares to show off some of its innovations this week before its shareholder meeting, there are signs that things are starting to click. Sales at Walmart.com rose 63 percent in the first quarter, up from 29 percent growth in the previous quarter and marking its fourth straight quarter of increases. Wal-Mart said most of the increase was not through acquisitions but was fueled by changes in its shipping strategy and a discount for shoppers who pick up their online orders. Walmart.com now offers 50 million products including those from third-party sellers, up from 10 million a year ago. In comparison, Amazon has hundreds of millions of products. David Spitz, CEO of e-commerce technology company ChannelAdvisor, says for some shoppers it has become ingrained that they start and finish their shopping at Amazon, and the Prime program reinforces that. He said Wal-Mart wasn’t putting a sufficient emphasis on keeping up. “If anything, the gap was widening,” Spitz said. “Jet.com was intended to be a jolt. Wal-Mart is clearly being more aggressive. There is a sense of urgency, but whether that is enough is the multibillion-dollar question.” Amazon accounted for 33 percent of U.S. online sales last year, according to the research firm Euromonitor. Wal-Mart moved into second place ahead of eBay, with 7.8 percent. Greg Melich, an analyst at research firm Evercore, estimates that Amazon customers spend an average of $800 annually on the site, and members of its $99-a-year Prime program spend on average 2.7 times more than others. “We don’t think specifically about Prime at all,” Lore said. “We think we (have) a customer base – those customers who want to be able to save money and they want to be able to shop in different ways, whether it be direct-to-home, grocery pickup or going to the physical store.” Its 4,700 stores are a strength for Wal-Mart because they buck the larger retail trend in seeing increases in shopper numbers and sales. The discount for store pickup is helping bring shoppers in. Wal-Mart says the expansion of stores with curbside pickup for groceries is also helping, since people often realize they forgot an item or two and run into the store. Amazon’s stores are mainly showcases for gadgets, or are textbook- and furniture-pickup locations aimed at college students. But Amazon keeps innovating. It’s testing an Amazon Go convenience store, where sensors track items as shoppers go and there’s no need to check out. Amazon also launched two grocery pickup kiosks in Seattle that allow Prime customers to buy fresh items online and pick them up in as little as 15 minutes instead of having them delivered. The service is free, and there’s no order minimum. Share Read or Post Comments Were you interviewed for this story? If so, please fill out our accuracy form Send questions/comments to the editors.

If Amazon's relationship with Prime members continues to grow, Melich said recently, then Amazon's path toward Wal-Mart's 9 percent of the total U.S. retail market from its current 3 percent is "reasonable." If Lore is worried, he doesn't acknowledge it. "We don't think specifically about Prime at all," he said. "We think we (have) got a customer base — those customers who want to be able to save money and they want to be able to shop in different ways, whether it be direct-to-home, grocery pickup or going to the physical store."

Wal-Mart says even the expansion of stores with curbside pickup for groceries is also helping, since people often realize they forgot an item or two and run into the store. And as rivals like Target struggle to get their grocery departments right, Wal-Mart is placing a priority on essentials like peanut butter, paper towels and fresh produce that shoppers buy often. Amazon's stores are mainly showcases for gadgets, or are textbook- and furniture-pickup locations aimed at college students. But it keeps innovating, and it's testing an Amazon Go convenience store, where sensors track items as shoppers go and there's no need to check out. Amazon just opened its first bookstore in Manhattan and seventh overall. Moreover, Amazon also launched two grocery pickup kiosks in Seattle that allow Prime customers to buy fresh items online and pick it up in as little as 15 minutes instead of having them delivered. The service is free, and there's no order minimum. Shipping remains intensely competitive. Amazon Prime members in more than 5,000 cities and towns can receive orders the same day or the next, depending on the item and location. Through Prime Now, members in more than 30 cities can get some items in an hour or two. "We've had competition every day of our existence at Amazon and it's never changed our approach," Amazon says. "We obsess over customers and the things we believe customers will always care about — low prices, vast selection, and fast delivery." Wal-Mart has revamped its shipping program and now offers free, two-day shipping for online orders of its most popular items with a minimum purchase order of $35. Lore says Wal-Mart customers are placing more orders and spending more than before. In April, Wal-Mart launched a service called Easy Reorder where the items shoppers buy with their credit card at a store will pop up on their online account for replenishment. As more integration happens behind the scenes of Walmart.com and Jet.com, Lore says that over time, Jet's "smart cart" technology will be integrated into the Wal-Mart site. Jet was built on a real-time pricing algorithm that determines which sellers are the most efficient in value and shipping. It adjusts prices and encourages shoppers to buy certain items for more savings. Wal-Mart says it's helping people to shop smarter by encouraging them to build an order of $35 and offering extra discounts for store pickups of online orders. And Lore says the plan is to get to several hundred million products on Wal-Mart's website over the next few years. "We want to sell them everything," Lore said. "The assortment is growing fast," he said. "But we know in certain categories, we need to make more progress." © Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

You'll catch a lot of hate for saying something like that. But that hate shows how hypocritical people are. For years wee-boos have been crying about Walmart paying low wages, and putting mom-and-pop stores out of business. Amazon in comparison was wiped out far more mom-and-pop stores, and being automated, with no sales staff, has simply eliminated huge numbers of jobs and their pay. The Walmart haters are curiously silent on Amazon. Just sell your cheap stuff to poor people or you will end up like Sears, JC Penny and Radio Shack At least poor people have a place where they can get more for what little money they have. As for Sears and Penny's, their decline is completely self-inflicted. These companies have been destroyed by their executives, who tend to be private-sector politicians with MBA's, but who know less about running a business than a cub scout knows about running a lemonade stand. 0 ( +0 / -0 ) Login to leave a comment Facebook users Use your Facebook account to login or register with JapanToday.

China manufacturing and services PMI allay fears of slowing economic momentum CS upgrades Myer and Super Retail, but consumer spending slump expected to continue British pound drops as polls indicate Labour is trimming gains of Conservatives Live updates Sort posts by Newest Oldest 4:38pm That's all for today - thanks everyone for reading this blog and posting your comments. We'll be back tomorrow from 9am. Have a good evening. 4:26pm Shares have closed slightly higher, thanks to some buying in oversold sectors such as banks and retail, but overall it was a dismal month for equity investors. The ASX ended the session up 0.1 per cent at 5724.6 but was down 3.4 per cent in May, its worst monthly performance since the market meltdown of January 2016 and biggest May drop since 2013. NAB's 1.3 per cent gain was the standout among the big four today, which otherwise just edged higher. Aristocrat Leisure was another big winner of the day, rising 3.8 per cent. CSL was the biggest drag on the benchmark index, falling 1.8 per cent, followed by a 2.9 per cent drop in Origin Energy. A dip in iron ore prices this week and headlines regarding the stockpiles of ore waiting in Chinese ports weighed on the big miners. Resource giants BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto slumped 0.4 per cent and 0.7 per cent respectively. With the iron ore price trading flat at $US58.50 a tonne, Fortescue Metals bucked the trend and closed up 1.3 per cent.  Retail stocks Myer and Super Retail Group received some buying support, after Credit Suisse announced the un-loved sector might be oversold in those instances. The bank upgraded both stocks to "neutral" and the stocks jumped 2.4 per cent and 1.3 per cent respectively.  Weighing heaviest on the market over the month was a steep 9.2 per cent fall in the financials sector, due to heavy selling in the big banks. 3:59pm Bitcoin's rollercoaster ride over the past week has cryptocurrency sceptics feeling vindicated. Bitcoin is down 1.5 per cent at $2216 in Asian trade, nearly 20 per cent below its record high of $US2798.97 hit last week. The digital currency's more than 100 per cent surge in the past two months looks eerily familiar, argue the bears, pointing to November 2013, when the price quintupled in short order to top $US1000 for the first time. By Valentine's Day it was worth around half that, and spent the better part of the next two years languishing below $US500. Then it absolutely exploded, jumping more than $US1400 in two months. At its height last week, one bitcoin could buy about two ounces of gold. Its champions touted the arrival into the mainstream of blockchain, the coin's underlying technology which they say can lift the poor out of poverty and make transactions more secure, inexpensive and efficient. But signs of a top have emerged, detractors warn. On May 25, bitcoin surged more than $US300 to a record only to turn tail and close little changed. The $US600 round trip was the biggest daily swing in its history. It then slumped 8 per cent the next day. 3:35pm Hong Kong's private home prices hit a record high for the sixth month in a row in April, reflecting a market fervour that the authorities are eager to tame. The Asian financial hub is one of the least affordable places on earth, where a nano-apartment of less than 20 square metres can cost as much as $US500,000. The dearth of supply, low interest rates, and the flow of capital from mainland China pushed prices up over 137 per cent since the financial crisis in 2008. In April, home prices rose 2.12 per cent from the previous month, according to an index compiled by the Rating and Valuation Department. The figure, at 327.4, surged nearly 20 per cent year-on-year. The latest index does not reflect the latest mortgage tightening measures announced by the city's de facto central bank earlier in May. "If property prices keep breaking records in the next month or two, I expect the government to introduce new cooling measures," said property consultancy Knight Frank's Senior Director Thomas Lam. He expects prices to rise 5 to 10 per cent this year. Some of the least affordable property in the world.  3:15pm Domino's audit of its Australian stores in response to allegations of widespread staff underpayments has slipped six months behind schedule. The pizza maker said today that the audit of more than 700 franchised and corporate stores is taking longer than anticipated and that it won't be able to meet its June deadline. The company now expects the audit to be finished within six months. The Fair Work Ombudsman (FWO) is also investigating a number of Domino's stores after media reports this year of widespread underpaying of staff and a visa scam at one franchisee-owned store. Shares in Domino's are down 1.4 per cent at $57.57, taking this week's losses to more than 6 per cent. Domino's shares have dropped more than 6 per cent this week.  Back to top 2:49pm Investors hoping for a quick rebound in June after May's ASX declines may be disappointed, with history suggesting they shouldn't count on a June recovery. The old adage to 'sell in May and go away' proved prescient in 2017, with the S&P/ASX200 down 3.4 per cent as concern over Australia's housing boom and weak retail spending combined with falling commodity prices to lead to a nasty coordinated sell-off in the big banks, miners and big-name retailers. And for now, perhaps investors looking for quick gains would do well to heed the last part of the saying. In the nine times the ASX has fallen in May since 2000 it has gone even further into the red in June for five of those years, and recovered some ground in only four years. And the trend has grown more negative of late - in the last seven years, five have seen the market trade in the red in June, with an average drop of 4.2 per cent. Tax-selling can keep stocks suppressed in June, said Argonaut executive director of corporate stockbroking James McGlew. This is particularly the case with illiquid small-caps. But this can also be a fantastic buying opportunity for investors willing to bear some short-term turbulence, he said. "This is the time of year when the herd mentality does start to show," McGlew said. You've got to be aware of that, and of which sectors benefit from that." Here's more Where to in June? Some traders are tipping a rebound. Photo: Louie Douvis 2:17pm Seek shares have dropped 1.6 per cent after Citi downgraded the stock from neutral to sell and cut its price target from $16.20 to $15.30 because of the impact the end of the housing boom would have on job listing volumes. It also cited weakness in Seek's Asian divisions and overexposure locally as reasons for the ratings cut.  The shares have declined 3.6 per cent over the last three days, falling to $16.89.  Citi says there has been rapid growth in ads for construction, trade, manufacturing and related jobs since 2014 even as the unemployment rate remained flat, but that those jobs are set to fall away following the peak of the housing market. Moves by regulators to tighten lending standards appear to have successfully cooled the runaway housing market, with property prices falling 1.1 per cent in May and apartment building approvals down 26 per cent over the past 12 months.  Citi predicts housing construction starts will fall by a quarter over the next two years and that job ad growth will fall to 1.5 per cent a year in 2018 and 2019, after growing at 10 per cent between 2014 and 2017.  While job ad numbers are usually connected to the unemployment rate, Citi told clients in a research note that half the outperformance of Seek was because of the housing construction boom and employee turnover in that industry.  "Even just a modest pullback in churn rates could lead to a large decline in the number of job ads, even if the change in the total number of people employed in the industry is negligible," analysts wrote.  1:53pm Shares in iron ore miners have turned south as Chinese futures in the bulk commodity resume their selloff following a two-day holiday. Fortescue is now down 0.6 per cent after earlier trading more than 1 per cent higher, while Rio Tinto has dropped 1.3 per cent. Dalian iron ore futures have slid 3.3 per cent to 436.5 yuan ($US64), on track for a fifth session in the red. Spot iron ore is at $US58.50 a tonne, close to its lowest since October. Analysts have been noting that while iron ore prices are falling, steel is trading close to five-year highs. This comes as Platts reports that Chinese gross steel margins for exported steel rebar has touched a 2017 high – nearly 80 per cent higher than lows touched on April 13. "The rise in steel mill profitability, which mostly reflects weaker iron ore and coking coal prices, should give way to stronger steel output and iron ore demand in coming weeks," says CBA analyst Vivek Dhar. 1:31pm The slump in consumer spending is expected to continue throughout the year as a major headwind for retailers across the country. In a note - 'What is going on in Australia's retail sector? - CBA blames weak wages growth as the single biggest factor weighing on the sector as households devote a greater portion of their wallet to health, utilities and education. "Consumers have a fine amount of disposable income and even with the assistance of a falling savings rate, record low wages growth has weighed significantly on the discretionary parts of retail trade," senior economist Gareth Aird said. "Soft total retail trade growth is largely down to a lack of spending growth on consumer durables and clothing." Demand for clothing and other discretionary goods has been weak for the past two years, as seen in falling department store sales and the collapse of a string of apparel retailers. Herringbone, Marcs and David Lawrence, Pumpkin Patch, Rhodes and Beckett are among a recent spate of largely high-end clothing retailers to have fallen into voluntary administration. Department store chain Myer has been warning "challenging trading conditions" continue to hurt its sales. The market value of retailers on the ASX have also come under pressure as investors sell down retail stocks following sales warnings and profit downgrades. Online giant Amazon's impending arrival in Australia will also put more pressure on retailers to sacrifice more profits for lower prices. Myer shares are at 86 cents, very close to all-time lows hit earlier this week, while JB Hi-Fi and Harvey Norman have suffered sell-downs largely linked to the Amazon threat. CBA also warned that the effectiveness of lower interest rates is close to being exhausted and only a lift in wages' growth will lead to an increase in retail spending. "Given the significant amount of slack in the labour market we don't see that happening in 2017 and we therefore conclude that the retail trade sector, in particular the discretionary parts of retail trade, will continue to be under pressure throughout the year," Aird said.  1:04pm When auction clearance rates fall to around 65 per cent in Sydney, a housing downturn will be official, property analyst SQM Research managing director Louis Christopher says. Christopher, who correctly called the start of the current housing boom in 2012, said that when Sydney auction clearance rates - one of the key measures of housing market performance - hit the mid-60 per cent level and clearances in Melbourne fall to the high 60 per cent level, then "a new downturn can be called." The preliminary auction clearance rate for Sydney last week was 76.2 per cent while Melbourne was on 77.3 per cent, according to Corelogic. Both were higher than the same period a year ago. "We do believe we are getting close to a top and perhaps the major banks passing on the bank levy might just be the point which creates a trigger for a slowdown. We will wait and see," Christopher said. He also said a downturn could be closer after observing a rise in unreported auctions in 2017 against the bumper level of 2015. Keep an eye on auction clearance rates.  Back to top 12:39pm The reactions to Altiar Asset Management's shock decision, taken by chairman and investment officer Philip Parker, to sell its equities fund an return the money to investors continues to be a key topic of discussion among Australia's investment professionals. The warning issued by Parker, which in large part rested on his concerns about the overheated property market, has been largely dismissed by senior property industry executives.

Joe Aston writes in Rear Window on "what has to have been the greatest money pit in Australian corporate history": In good news for investors in Network Ten, the free-to-air broadcaster is having a good week so far, closing at 19¢, off its Friday low of 17¢. Everything's relative, right? Remember this is after the 1-for-10 consolidation of Ten shares in January 2016. So when WIN proprietor Bruce Gordon was buying millions of these last decade for $2.58 a pop, he was effectively paying nearly $26 in a like-for-like comparison to the scrip you could pick up today for less than a silver coin. According to an ASX filing of July 2006, Gordon-related entities owned 48.8 million Ten shares, worth $126.2 million. If he'd done nothing since, he'd now own 4.88 million shares worth a princely $927,200. But instead he kept buying and buying and buying, including newly-issued capital. Gordon now owns 55.5 million post-consolidation Ten shares, worth $10.4 million. Yep, that's $9.5 million for, in effect, half a billion of shares. No wonder he catches the bus to Wollongong.  Chairman of archrival Seven, Kerry Stokes, quietly amassed a stake in late 2012 worth around $40 million. According to Ten's 2016 annual report, Stokes' Network Investments had 11.5 million shares as at October, now worth $2.2 million, which wouldn't buy you a bedsit in Darling Point.  Foxtel's $77 million placement just 18 months ago is now worth $9.75 million – which isn't inconsistent with the direction of Foxtel's own value to News Corp and Telstra. News co-chairman Lachlan Murdoch and then Consolidated Media chair James Packer paid around $130 million each (before the multiple raisings) at $1.50 (or, in effect, $15) in 2010 for a combined 14.9 per cent position now worth just $10.6 million And having sunk near enough to $200 million into Ten since 2011, Gina Rinehart's 8.2 per cent stake is now worth $5.8 million.  Read the full piece on the AFR. The biggest shareholder of Ten Network is Bruce Gordon, with 15 per cent of shares. He also owns regional broadcaster WIN.  Photo: Sylvia Liber 11:41am One of the nation's biggest mutual lenders has cut interest-only loans in half and hiked interest rates by 40 basis points, heralding a tough new phase in attempts to cut back on risky borrowing. It means borrowers will have to take out two loans for a single property – a minimum principal and interest loan and a maximum interest-only. Teachers Mutual Bank, which includes UniBank and Firefighters Mutual Bank, is requiring a minimum of 50 per cent principal and interest for all home loans, which means the maximum interest-only is also 50 per cent. A new borrower seeking $300,000 will have two loans – a minimum of $150,000 on principal and interest and a maximum of $150,000 on interest-only. In addition, borrowers cannot draw down any cash from any loan where part of the total borrowing is interest-only and scrutiny of ability to pay has been toughened. It comes as latest APRA numbers reveal that interest-only loans still account for more than 36 per cent of total home loans by value in the March quarter, down from 37.5 per cent previously. APRA issued an order at the end of March requiring banks to cut interest-only loans to 30 per cent of new residential lending. Since then most lenders have increased minimum deposits to at least 20 per cent, raised interest rates, toughened scrutiny of borrowers' ability to pay and banned overseas' lenders. Here's more at the AFR Banks are cracking down on interest-only loans. Photo: Supplied. 11:11am Growth in China's manufacturing sector in May kept pace with the previous month, an official survey shows, beating expectations in a reassuring sign the world's second-biggest economy is not losing too much steam after a solid first quarter performance. The official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) stood at 51.2 in May, compared with the previous month's 51.2 and above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis. Continuing momentum gives policy makers room to rein in increased leverage and financial risks. Analysts last month upgraded forecasts for China's economic growth this year after an unexpected pick-up to 6.9 per cent in the first quarter. The data has put a bit of a spring into the Australian market, with both shares and the Aussie rising to the day's highs (albeit not a huge gain). 10:50am Australia's yield advantage over the US is shrinking fast, which has stirred the Aussie dollar bears, but ANZ head of FX exchange Daniel Been notes that rate differentials are only one driver of the currency. The 10-year yield spread has narrowed to just 18 basis points, and last week even fell to just 16 basis points, the lowest in 16 years. The last time the yield gap was at these levels, the Aussie was fetching less than US50¢, but Been doesn't believe that the currency will fall below even US70¢, pointing out that when the spread was negative in 1998 the Aussie was 10¢ higher than in 2001. "This suggests that the absolute level of yield was not the only important factor for the AUD, even when it was very narrow," Been says, adding that even when you include changes in the terms of trade it doesn't tell the whole story. Instead, forex traders should include risk factors and the US dollar index to explain the performance of currencies such as the Aussie. As examples of risk driving market performance in 2001, Been cites the tech bubble bursting and the Enron scandal The subsequent rally in the US dollar was on its own worth about 5 cents of underperformance in the Aussie, he has calculated. So what does that mean for today? Been says it's much more helpful to look at the Aussie through this broader frame, which makes the situation for the currency look far less dire on a number of fronts. Here are a few reasons why he believes the Aussie isn't headed for 2001 levels: The terms of trade are significantly stronger than it was in 2000. In fact China was not even a part of the WTO last time the spread was at this level; The risk premium is already negative, implying the negative effect of a tighter spread is already integrated into the markets expectations for the AUD; The probability of a significant deterioration in risk appetite remains lower than it did in 2001, at least in the near term As such, Been doesn't believe that the fall in the interest rate spread is about to drive a slump in the AUD, or that the AUD at current levels is fundamentally misaligned with the level of rates given the broader environment. Quite the contrary, Been says the recent improvement in the current account should dampen the negative impact of the narrow rate differential, as the Australian economy's funding need has shrunk significantly.  "We think that the biggest risk to the AUD is ultimately going to be a sharp deterioration in risk appetite, rather than the narrowing in spreads, however we continue to think that, at least over the next 12 months, this remains a tail risk," Been says. "Until this kind of risk event can become integrated into a central scenario rather than a tail, we think that the AUD will remain stable above US70¢." Back to top 10:37am Shares have opened fairly flat, with some buying in the oversold retail sector offset by drops in energy stocks. The ASX is down 0.1 per cent at 5714.2, putting it on track for a loss of 3.5 per cent in May, its worst monthly performance since the market mayhem of January last year. "Sentiment on Australian markets today could be influenced by how China's steel and iron ore markets perform when trading gets under way after a two-day holiday," CMC chief market analyst Ric Spooner says. "Prices were sliding at the end of last week and sentiment will not be helped if strong downward momentum continues today." Spooner added that investors will be hoping that today's release of China's manufacturing PMI can also hold the line after a softer read in April, which showed a decline in employment conditions. Blue chips are all over the shop, with the big banks trading flat to slightly higher, BHP down 0.2 per cent but Rio up 0.1 per cent and Fortescue gaining 1.25 per cent. One of the biggest winners is Aristocrat Leisure, up another 3.1 per cent as the pokies maker moves from strength to strength. Market dogs in the retail sector are catching some relief, with Myer gaining 1.8 per cent and Super Retail up 1.3 per cent after Credit Suisse upgraded both stocks to 'neutral'. 9:53am on 31 May 2017 SPONSORED POST The ASX's worst month since January 2016 will soon be in the rearview mirrow, and IG strategist Chris Weston wonders whether June has anything better in store: For some the idea of turning the page and closing what has been a fairly bleak month to be long the Aussie equity market will be welcomed. That being said, being long certain industrial and telco names has seen strong outperformance in the portfolio. What won't be welcomed is the idea that June is actually the worst month to be long or tracking the Aussie equity market, with the average loss over the past decade at 2.2%. We have seen the past four months of June down by an average of 3.1% and while past performance obvious doesn't predict future returns it is a consideration. Certainly, something to think about and the technical set-up on the ASX 200 is interesting, with the bulls happy to defend the 5775/77 level yesterday which we can see from the daily chart seems a quite pivotal support level representing swing lows in March and May. A break of this level and we should be talking sub-5600, but for now, we are watching to see if the bulls can build on the platform set yesterday. Turning to Asia and it will be interesting to watch China come back on line today after its two-day holiday. Of course, while the spot iron ore market has been open (as price is fixed in Singapore), we get the re-open of the Dalian iron ore and steel futures exchanges today and who knows where that will trade. The market will keep a beady eye on official manufacturing and services PMI data (at 11:00 AEST) for further signs of an economic downturn and we should expect a very modest slowdown in the pace of expansion here, with the manufacturing PMI data expected in at 51. Whether we are talking copper or AUD, the market hasn't been overly sensitive to this print of late, but that could change if the data comes in far lower or higher than forecast. Again, the prospect of the latter materialising seems very low.

"New Zealand's financial system remains sound and the risks facing the system have reduced in the past six months," Reserve Bank governor Graeme Wheeler said in the bank's semi-annual Financial Stability Report on Wednesday in Wellington. Still, he warned that global uncertainty remains elevated and that New Zealand would be vulnerable if a sharp reversal in risk sentiment drove up borrowing costs for banks. New Zealand home-owners have built up record amounts of debt in recent years as house prices soared, which may leave many stretched if borrowing costs were to rise quickly. Wheeler has cut his benchmark interest rate to a record low of 1.75 per cent to spur weak general inflation, requiring him to introduce lending restrictions in an attempt to curb housing demand. He said today that those restrictions have caused house-price growth to slow over the past eight months. However, "house prices remain elevated relative to incomes and rents, and any resurgence would be of concern", Wheeler said. A recovery in dairy prices over the past year had reduced risks faced by the dairy sector, though some parts of carry excessive debt and remain vulnerable, the RBNZ said. New Zealand's banking system "maintains strong capital and funding buffers, and profitability remains robust", the central bank said. Still, banks had increased reliance on offshore funding for credit growth and remain exposed to a shift in global sentiment. "A sharp reversal in risk sentiment could lead to higher funding costs for New Zealand banks and an increase in domestic borrowing costs," the RBNZ said. New Zealand home-owners have built up record amounts of debt in recent years as house prices soared, which may leave many stretched if borrowing costs were to rise quickly.  9:44am on 31 May 2017 Here are the overnight market highlights: SPI futures down 4 points to 5718 AUD +0.4% to 74.66 US cents (Overnight range: 74.16-74.69) On Wall St, Dow -0.2%, S&P 500 -0.1%, Nasdaq -0.1% In New York, BHP +0.4%, Rio +0.8% In Europe, Stoxx 50 -0.5%, FTSE -0.3%, CAC -0.5%, DAX -0.2% Spot gold -0.4% to $US1262.95 an ounce Brent crude -0.9% to $US51.82 a barrel Iron ore unchanged at $US58.50 a tonne Dalian exchange closed LME aluminium -1.3% to $US1926 a tonne LME copper little changed at $US5656 a tonne 10-year bond yield: US 2.21%, Germany 0.29%, Australia 2.39% Plus a few analyst recommendation changes: Henderson Group (HGGDA): New buy at UBS, PT $35.25; New market perform at KBW, PT $32 Myer Holdings (MYR): Raised to neutral at Credit Suisse, PT $0.82 Seek (SEK): Cut to sell at Citi Super Retail (SUL): Raised to neutral at Credit Suisse, PT $7.56 What to watch today: April private sector credit; China May manufacturing PMI, non manufacturing PMI; Japan April industrial production, housing starts; Euro zone April unemployment rate; Fed Beige Book And not to forget, Orica is trading ex-dividend. 9:37am on 31 May 2017 The British pound came under pressure overnight after a new poll found that PM Theresa May's Conservative Party risks falling short of an overall majority in next month's national election. The pound fell to $US1.2791, near a one-month low of $US1.2775 touched on Friday. The pound also slipped to 0.8738 pound per euro, near Friday's eight-week low of 0.8750, while the Aussie strengthened about 0.5 per cent to 58.3 pence. New constituency-by-constituency modelling by YouGov showed the Conservative Party might lose 20 of the 330 seats it holds while the opposition Labour Party could gain nearly 30 seats.

The US dollar fell to two-week lows against the safe-haven yen as investors turned cautious amid political worries in Europe as well as weaker stock and commodity markets after a long US holiday weekend. Worries that US political stalemate due to investigations into President Donald Trump's ties with Russia could hamper progress on tax cuts and other stimulus measures from Washington has been undermining the dollar. The dollar fell to near two-week low of 110.665 yen and last traded at 110.85 yen, while the Aussie lifted to US74.61¢. The US dollar index dipped to 97.396, around the levels it was trading at before Trump was elected in November. The trend is Labour's friend. Photo: HuffPo Back to top Search pagination Current page Live Article Posts1 Next Live Article Posts2 Share via Email Post on facebook wall Share on Google Plus Share on twitter Post to Linkedin Share on Reddit 1 new post(s) available.

China manufacturing and services PMI allay fears of slowing economic momentum CS upgrades Myer and Super Retail, but consumer spending slump expected to continue British pound drops as polls indicate Labour is trimming gains of Conservatives Live updates Sort posts by Newest Oldest 4:38pm That's all for today - thanks everyone for reading this blog and posting your comments. We'll be back tomorrow from 9am. Have a good evening. 4:26pm Shares have closed slightly higher, thanks to some buying in oversold sectors such as banks and retail, but overall it was a dismal month for equity investors. The ASX ended the session up 0.1 per cent at 5724.6 but was down 3.4 per cent in May, its worst monthly performance since the market meltdown of January 2016 and biggest May drop since 2013. NAB's 1.3 per cent gain was the standout among the big four today, which otherwise just edged higher. Aristocrat Leisure was another big winner of the day, rising 3.8 per cent. CSL was the biggest drag on the benchmark index, falling 1.8 per cent, followed by a 2.9 per cent drop in Origin Energy. A dip in iron ore prices this week and headlines regarding the stockpiles of ore waiting in Chinese ports weighed on the big miners. Resource giants BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto slumped 0.4 per cent and 0.7 per cent respectively. With the iron ore price trading flat at $US58.50 a tonne, Fortescue Metals bucked the trend and closed up 1.3 per cent.  Retail stocks Myer and Super Retail Group received some buying support, after Credit Suisse announced the un-loved sector might be oversold in those instances. The bank upgraded both stocks to "neutral" and the stocks jumped 2.4 per cent and 1.3 per cent respectively.  Weighing heaviest on the market over the month was a steep 9.2 per cent fall in the financials sector, due to heavy selling in the big banks. 3:59pm Bitcoin's rollercoaster ride over the past week has cryptocurrency sceptics feeling vindicated. Bitcoin is down 1.5 per cent at $2216 in Asian trade, nearly 20 per cent below its record high of $US2798.97 hit last week. The digital currency's more than 100 per cent surge in the past two months looks eerily familiar, argue the bears, pointing to November 2013, when the price quintupled in short order to top $US1000 for the first time. By Valentine's Day it was worth around half that, and spent the better part of the next two years languishing below $US500. Then it absolutely exploded, jumping more than $US1400 in two months. At its height last week, one bitcoin could buy about two ounces of gold. Its champions touted the arrival into the mainstream of blockchain, the coin's underlying technology which they say can lift the poor out of poverty and make transactions more secure, inexpensive and efficient. But signs of a top have emerged, detractors warn. On May 25, bitcoin surged more than $US300 to a record only to turn tail and close little changed. The $US600 round trip was the biggest daily swing in its history. It then slumped 8 per cent the next day. 3:35pm Hong Kong's private home prices hit a record high for the sixth month in a row in April, reflecting a market fervour that the authorities are eager to tame. The Asian financial hub is one of the least affordable places on earth, where a nano-apartment of less than 20 square metres can cost as much as $US500,000. The dearth of supply, low interest rates, and the flow of capital from mainland China pushed prices up over 137 per cent since the financial crisis in 2008. In April, home prices rose 2.12 per cent from the previous month, according to an index compiled by the Rating and Valuation Department. The figure, at 327.4, surged nearly 20 per cent year-on-year. The latest index does not reflect the latest mortgage tightening measures announced by the city's de facto central bank earlier in May. "If property prices keep breaking records in the next month or two, I expect the government to introduce new cooling measures," said property consultancy Knight Frank's Senior Director Thomas Lam. He expects prices to rise 5 to 10 per cent this year. Some of the least affordable property in the world.  3:15pm Domino's audit of its Australian stores in response to allegations of widespread staff underpayments has slipped six months behind schedule. The pizza maker said today that the audit of more than 700 franchised and corporate stores is taking longer than anticipated and that it won't be able to meet its June deadline. The company now expects the audit to be finished within six months. The Fair Work Ombudsman (FWO) is also investigating a number of Domino's stores after media reports this year of widespread underpaying of staff and a visa scam at one franchisee-owned store. Shares in Domino's are down 1.4 per cent at $57.57, taking this week's losses to more than 6 per cent. Domino's shares have dropped more than 6 per cent this week.  Back to top 2:49pm Investors hoping for a quick rebound in June after May's ASX declines may be disappointed, with history suggesting they shouldn't count on a June recovery. The old adage to 'sell in May and go away' proved prescient in 2017, with the S&P/ASX200 down 3.4 per cent as concern over Australia's housing boom and weak retail spending combined with falling commodity prices to lead to a nasty coordinated sell-off in the big banks, miners and big-name retailers. And for now, perhaps investors looking for quick gains would do well to heed the last part of the saying. In the nine times the ASX has fallen in May since 2000 it has gone even further into the red in June for five of those years, and recovered some ground in only four years. And the trend has grown more negative of late - in the last seven years, five have seen the market trade in the red in June, with an average drop of 4.2 per cent. Tax-selling can keep stocks suppressed in June, said Argonaut executive director of corporate stockbroking James McGlew. This is particularly the case with illiquid small-caps. But this can also be a fantastic buying opportunity for investors willing to bear some short-term turbulence, he said. "This is the time of year when the herd mentality does start to show," McGlew said. You've got to be aware of that, and of which sectors benefit from that." Here's more Where to in June? Some traders are tipping a rebound. Photo: Louie Douvis 2:17pm Seek shares have dropped 1.6 per cent after Citi downgraded the stock from neutral to sell and cut its price target from $16.20 to $15.30 because of the impact the end of the housing boom would have on job listing volumes. It also cited weakness in Seek's Asian divisions and overexposure locally as reasons for the ratings cut.  The shares have declined 3.6 per cent over the last three days, falling to $16.89.  Citi says there has been rapid growth in ads for construction, trade, manufacturing and related jobs since 2014 even as the unemployment rate remained flat, but that those jobs are set to fall away following the peak of the housing market. Moves by regulators to tighten lending standards appear to have successfully cooled the runaway housing market, with property prices falling 1.1 per cent in May and apartment building approvals down 26 per cent over the past 12 months.  Citi predicts housing construction starts will fall by a quarter over the next two years and that job ad growth will fall to 1.5 per cent a year in 2018 and 2019, after growing at 10 per cent between 2014 and 2017.  While job ad numbers are usually connected to the unemployment rate, Citi told clients in a research note that half the outperformance of Seek was because of the housing construction boom and employee turnover in that industry.  "Even just a modest pullback in churn rates could lead to a large decline in the number of job ads, even if the change in the total number of people employed in the industry is negligible," analysts wrote.  1:53pm Shares in iron ore miners have turned south as Chinese futures in the bulk commodity resume their selloff following a two-day holiday. Fortescue is now down 0.6 per cent after earlier trading more than 1 per cent higher, while Rio Tinto has dropped 1.3 per cent. Dalian iron ore futures have slid 3.3 per cent to 436.5 yuan ($US64), on track for a fifth session in the red. Spot iron ore is at $US58.50 a tonne, close to its lowest since October. Analysts have been noting that while iron ore prices are falling, steel is trading close to five-year highs. This comes as Platts reports that Chinese gross steel margins for exported steel rebar has touched a 2017 high – nearly 80 per cent higher than lows touched on April 13. "The rise in steel mill profitability, which mostly reflects weaker iron ore and coking coal prices, should give way to stronger steel output and iron ore demand in coming weeks," says CBA analyst Vivek Dhar. 1:31pm The slump in consumer spending is expected to continue throughout the year as a major headwind for retailers across the country. In a note - 'What is going on in Australia's retail sector? - CBA blames weak wages growth as the single biggest factor weighing on the sector as households devote a greater portion of their wallet to health, utilities and education. "Consumers have a fine amount of disposable income and even with the assistance of a falling savings rate, record low wages growth has weighed significantly on the discretionary parts of retail trade," senior economist Gareth Aird said. "Soft total retail trade growth is largely down to a lack of spending growth on consumer durables and clothing." Demand for clothing and other discretionary goods has been weak for the past two years, as seen in falling department store sales and the collapse of a string of apparel retailers. Herringbone, Marcs and David Lawrence, Pumpkin Patch, Rhodes and Beckett are among a recent spate of largely high-end clothing retailers to have fallen into voluntary administration. Department store chain Myer has been warning "challenging trading conditions" continue to hurt its sales. The market value of retailers on the ASX have also come under pressure as investors sell down retail stocks following sales warnings and profit downgrades. Online giant Amazon's impending arrival in Australia will also put more pressure on retailers to sacrifice more profits for lower prices. Myer shares are at 86 cents, very close to all-time lows hit earlier this week, while JB Hi-Fi and Harvey Norman have suffered sell-downs largely linked to the Amazon threat. CBA also warned that the effectiveness of lower interest rates is close to being exhausted and only a lift in wages' growth will lead to an increase in retail spending. "Given the significant amount of slack in the labour market we don't see that happening in 2017 and we therefore conclude that the retail trade sector, in particular the discretionary parts of retail trade, will continue to be under pressure throughout the year," Aird said.  1:04pm When auction clearance rates fall to around 65 per cent in Sydney, a housing downturn will be official, property analyst SQM Research managing director Louis Christopher says. Christopher, who correctly called the start of the current housing boom in 2012, said that when Sydney auction clearance rates - one of the key measures of housing market performance - hit the mid-60 per cent level and clearances in Melbourne fall to the high 60 per cent level, then "a new downturn can be called." The preliminary auction clearance rate for Sydney last week was 76.2 per cent while Melbourne was on 77.3 per cent, according to Corelogic. Both were higher than the same period a year ago. "We do believe we are getting close to a top and perhaps the major banks passing on the bank levy might just be the point which creates a trigger for a slowdown. We will wait and see," Christopher said. He also said a downturn could be closer after observing a rise in unreported auctions in 2017 against the bumper level of 2015. Keep an eye on auction clearance rates.  Back to top 12:39pm The reactions to Altiar Asset Management's shock decision, taken by chairman and investment officer Philip Parker, to sell its equities fund an return the money to investors continues to be a key topic of discussion among Australia's investment professionals. The warning issued by Parker, which in large part rested on his concerns about the overheated property market, has been largely dismissed by senior property industry executives.

Joe Aston writes in Rear Window on "what has to have been the greatest money pit in Australian corporate history": In good news for investors in Network Ten, the free-to-air broadcaster is having a good week so far, closing at 19¢, off its Friday low of 17¢. Everything's relative, right? Remember this is after the 1-for-10 consolidation of Ten shares in January 2016. So when WIN proprietor Bruce Gordon was buying millions of these last decade for $2.58 a pop, he was effectively paying nearly $26 in a like-for-like comparison to the scrip you could pick up today for less than a silver coin. According to an ASX filing of July 2006, Gordon-related entities owned 48.8 million Ten shares, worth $126.2 million. If he'd done nothing since, he'd now own 4.88 million shares worth a princely $927,200. But instead he kept buying and buying and buying, including newly-issued capital. Gordon now owns 55.5 million post-consolidation Ten shares, worth $10.4 million. Yep, that's $9.5 million for, in effect, half a billion of shares. No wonder he catches the bus to Wollongong.  Chairman of archrival Seven, Kerry Stokes, quietly amassed a stake in late 2012 worth around $40 million. According to Ten's 2016 annual report, Stokes' Network Investments had 11.5 million shares as at October, now worth $2.2 million, which wouldn't buy you a bedsit in Darling Point.  Foxtel's $77 million placement just 18 months ago is now worth $9.75 million – which isn't inconsistent with the direction of Foxtel's own value to News Corp and Telstra. News co-chairman Lachlan Murdoch and then Consolidated Media chair James Packer paid around $130 million each (before the multiple raisings) at $1.50 (or, in effect, $15) in 2010 for a combined 14.9 per cent position now worth just $10.6 million And having sunk near enough to $200 million into Ten since 2011, Gina Rinehart's 8.2 per cent stake is now worth $5.8 million.  Read the full piece on the AFR. The biggest shareholder of Ten Network is Bruce Gordon, with 15 per cent of shares. He also owns regional broadcaster WIN.  Photo: Sylvia Liber 11:41am One of the nation's biggest mutual lenders has cut interest-only loans in half and hiked interest rates by 40 basis points, heralding a tough new phase in attempts to cut back on risky borrowing. It means borrowers will have to take out two loans for a single property – a minimum principal and interest loan and a maximum interest-only. Teachers Mutual Bank, which includes UniBank and Firefighters Mutual Bank, is requiring a minimum of 50 per cent principal and interest for all home loans, which means the maximum interest-only is also 50 per cent. A new borrower seeking $300,000 will have two loans – a minimum of $150,000 on principal and interest and a maximum of $150,000 on interest-only. In addition, borrowers cannot draw down any cash from any loan where part of the total borrowing is interest-only and scrutiny of ability to pay has been toughened. It comes as latest APRA numbers reveal that interest-only loans still account for more than 36 per cent of total home loans by value in the March quarter, down from 37.5 per cent previously. APRA issued an order at the end of March requiring banks to cut interest-only loans to 30 per cent of new residential lending. Since then most lenders have increased minimum deposits to at least 20 per cent, raised interest rates, toughened scrutiny of borrowers' ability to pay and banned overseas' lenders. Here's more at the AFR Banks are cracking down on interest-only loans. Photo: Supplied. 11:11am Growth in China's manufacturing sector in May kept pace with the previous month, an official survey shows, beating expectations in a reassuring sign the world's second-biggest economy is not losing too much steam after a solid first quarter performance. The official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) stood at 51.2 in May, compared with the previous month's 51.2 and above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis. Continuing momentum gives policy makers room to rein in increased leverage and financial risks. Analysts last month upgraded forecasts for China's economic growth this year after an unexpected pick-up to 6.9 per cent in the first quarter. The data has put a bit of a spring into the Australian market, with both shares and the Aussie rising to the day's highs (albeit not a huge gain). 10:50am Australia's yield advantage over the US is shrinking fast, which has stirred the Aussie dollar bears, but ANZ head of FX exchange Daniel Been notes that rate differentials are only one driver of the currency. The 10-year yield spread has narrowed to just 18 basis points, and last week even fell to just 16 basis points, the lowest in 16 years. The last time the yield gap was at these levels, the Aussie was fetching less than US50¢, but Been doesn't believe that the currency will fall below even US70¢, pointing out that when the spread was negative in 1998 the Aussie was 10¢ higher than in 2001. "This suggests that the absolute level of yield was not the only important factor for the AUD, even when it was very narrow," Been says, adding that even when you include changes in the terms of trade it doesn't tell the whole story. Instead, forex traders should include risk factors and the US dollar index to explain the performance of currencies such as the Aussie. As examples of risk driving market performance in 2001, Been cites the tech bubble bursting and the Enron scandal The subsequent rally in the US dollar was on its own worth about 5 cents of underperformance in the Aussie, he has calculated. So what does that mean for today? Been says it's much more helpful to look at the Aussie through this broader frame, which makes the situation for the currency look far less dire on a number of fronts. Here are a few reasons why he believes the Aussie isn't headed for 2001 levels: The terms of trade are significantly stronger than it was in 2000. In fact China was not even a part of the WTO last time the spread was at this level; The risk premium is already negative, implying the negative effect of a tighter spread is already integrated into the markets expectations for the AUD; The probability of a significant deterioration in risk appetite remains lower than it did in 2001, at least in the near term As such, Been doesn't believe that the fall in the interest rate spread is about to drive a slump in the AUD, or that the AUD at current levels is fundamentally misaligned with the level of rates given the broader environment. Quite the contrary, Been says the recent improvement in the current account should dampen the negative impact of the narrow rate differential, as the Australian economy's funding need has shrunk significantly.  "We think that the biggest risk to the AUD is ultimately going to be a sharp deterioration in risk appetite, rather than the narrowing in spreads, however we continue to think that, at least over the next 12 months, this remains a tail risk," Been says. "Until this kind of risk event can become integrated into a central scenario rather than a tail, we think that the AUD will remain stable above US70¢." Back to top 10:37am Shares have opened fairly flat, with some buying in the oversold retail sector offset by drops in energy stocks. The ASX is down 0.1 per cent at 5714.2, putting it on track for a loss of 3.5 per cent in May, its worst monthly performance since the market mayhem of January last year. "Sentiment on Australian markets today could be influenced by how China's steel and iron ore markets perform when trading gets under way after a two-day holiday," CMC chief market analyst Ric Spooner says. "Prices were sliding at the end of last week and sentiment will not be helped if strong downward momentum continues today." Spooner added that investors will be hoping that today's release of China's manufacturing PMI can also hold the line after a softer read in April, which showed a decline in employment conditions. Blue chips are all over the shop, with the big banks trading flat to slightly higher, BHP down 0.2 per cent but Rio up 0.1 per cent and Fortescue gaining 1.25 per cent. One of the biggest winners is Aristocrat Leisure, up another 3.1 per cent as the pokies maker moves from strength to strength. Market dogs in the retail sector are catching some relief, with Myer gaining 1.8 per cent and Super Retail up 1.3 per cent after Credit Suisse upgraded both stocks to 'neutral'. 9:53am on 31 May 2017 SPONSORED POST The ASX's worst month since January 2016 will soon be in the rearview mirrow, and IG strategist Chris Weston wonders whether June has anything better in store: For some the idea of turning the page and closing what has been a fairly bleak month to be long the Aussie equity market will be welcomed. That being said, being long certain industrial and telco names has seen strong outperformance in the portfolio. What won't be welcomed is the idea that June is actually the worst month to be long or tracking the Aussie equity market, with the average loss over the past decade at 2.2%. We have seen the past four months of June down by an average of 3.1% and while past performance obvious doesn't predict future returns it is a consideration. Certainly, something to think about and the technical set-up on the ASX 200 is interesting, with the bulls happy to defend the 5775/77 level yesterday which we can see from the daily chart seems a quite pivotal support level representing swing lows in March and May. A break of this level and we should be talking sub-5600, but for now, we are watching to see if the bulls can build on the platform set yesterday. Turning to Asia and it will be interesting to watch China come back on line today after its two-day holiday. Of course, while the spot iron ore market has been open (as price is fixed in Singapore), we get the re-open of the Dalian iron ore and steel futures exchanges today and who knows where that will trade. The market will keep a beady eye on official manufacturing and services PMI data (at 11:00 AEST) for further signs of an economic downturn and we should expect a very modest slowdown in the pace of expansion here, with the manufacturing PMI data expected in at 51. Whether we are talking copper or AUD, the market hasn't been overly sensitive to this print of late, but that could change if the data comes in far lower or higher than forecast. Again, the prospect of the latter materialising seems very low.

"New Zealand's financial system remains sound and the risks facing the system have reduced in the past six months," Reserve Bank governor Graeme Wheeler said in the bank's semi-annual Financial Stability Report on Wednesday in Wellington. Still, he warned that global uncertainty remains elevated and that New Zealand would be vulnerable if a sharp reversal in risk sentiment drove up borrowing costs for banks. New Zealand home-owners have built up record amounts of debt in recent years as house prices soared, which may leave many stretched if borrowing costs were to rise quickly. Wheeler has cut his benchmark interest rate to a record low of 1.75 per cent to spur weak general inflation, requiring him to introduce lending restrictions in an attempt to curb housing demand. He said today that those restrictions have caused house-price growth to slow over the past eight months. However, "house prices remain elevated relative to incomes and rents, and any resurgence would be of concern", Wheeler said. A recovery in dairy prices over the past year had reduced risks faced by the dairy sector, though some parts of carry excessive debt and remain vulnerable, the RBNZ said. New Zealand's banking system "maintains strong capital and funding buffers, and profitability remains robust", the central bank said. Still, banks had increased reliance on offshore funding for credit growth and remain exposed to a shift in global sentiment. "A sharp reversal in risk sentiment could lead to higher funding costs for New Zealand banks and an increase in domestic borrowing costs," the RBNZ said. New Zealand home-owners have built up record amounts of debt in recent years as house prices soared, which may leave many stretched if borrowing costs were to rise quickly.  9:44am on 31 May 2017 Here are the overnight market highlights: SPI futures down 4 points to 5718 AUD +0.4% to 74.66 US cents (Overnight range: 74.16-74.69) On Wall St, Dow -0.2%, S&P 500 -0.1%, Nasdaq -0.1% In New York, BHP +0.4%, Rio +0.8% In Europe, Stoxx 50 -0.5%, FTSE -0.3%, CAC -0.5%, DAX -0.2% Spot gold -0.4% to $US1262.95 an ounce Brent crude -0.9% to $US51.82 a barrel Iron ore unchanged at $US58.50 a tonne Dalian exchange closed LME aluminium -1.3% to $US1926 a tonne LME copper little changed at $US5656 a tonne 10-year bond yield: US 2.21%, Germany 0.29%, Australia 2.39% Plus a few analyst recommendation changes: Henderson Group (HGGDA): New buy at UBS, PT $35.25; New market perform at KBW, PT $32 Myer Holdings (MYR): Raised to neutral at Credit Suisse, PT $0.82 Seek (SEK): Cut to sell at Citi Super Retail (SUL): Raised to neutral at Credit Suisse, PT $7.56 What to watch today: April private sector credit; China May manufacturing PMI, non manufacturing PMI; Japan April industrial production, housing starts; Euro zone April unemployment rate; Fed Beige Book And not to forget, Orica is trading ex-dividend. 9:37am on 31 May 2017 The British pound came under pressure overnight after a new poll found that PM Theresa May's Conservative Party risks falling short of an overall majority in next month's national election. The pound fell to $US1.2791, near a one-month low of $US1.2775 touched on Friday. The pound also slipped to 0.8738 pound per euro, near Friday's eight-week low of 0.8750, while the Aussie strengthened about 0.5 per cent to 58.3 pence. New constituency-by-constituency modelling by YouGov showed the Conservative Party might lose 20 of the 330 seats it holds while the opposition Labour Party could gain nearly 30 seats.

The US dollar fell to two-week lows against the safe-haven yen as investors turned cautious amid political worries in Europe as well as weaker stock and commodity markets after a long US holiday weekend. Worries that US political stalemate due to investigations into President Donald Trump's ties with Russia could hamper progress on tax cuts and other stimulus measures from Washington has been undermining the dollar. The dollar fell to near two-week low of 110.665 yen and last traded at 110.85 yen, while the Aussie lifted to US74.61¢. The US dollar index dipped to 97.396, around the levels it was trading at before Trump was elected in November. The trend is Labour's friend. Photo: HuffPo Back to top Search pagination Current page Live Article Posts1 Next Live Article Posts2 Share via Email Post on facebook wall Share on Google Plus Share on twitter Post to Linkedin Share on Reddit 1 new post(s) available.

Below is a preview: The GLORIOUS @WWENXT Champion @REALBobbyRoode returns to @FullSail on an ALL-NEW #WWENXT at 8/7c on @WWENetwork! #RAW pic.twitter.com/Y9OTIWNSxz — WWE (@WWE) May 30, 2017 As noted, John Cena revealed earlier today that Tapout has new men’s body spray at Walmart stores. Below is the full announcement: WWE® Superstar John Cena Introduces New Tapout Men’s Body Sprays High-Performance Body Sprays to Bring Out the Unstoppable You NEW YORK, May 30, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — Tapout Body Sprays, a new line of six high-performance scents, is the latest launch for the premier fitness brand Tapout®. The Tapout Body Sprays Collection are now available at Walmart stores and inspires every individual to push the boundaries and ignite the strength needed to break through barriers. As a brand ambassador for Tapout Body Sprays, WWE Superstar John Cena will appear in an action-packed ad campaign and bring to life what the brand represents – discipline, determination and motivation – through exclusive digital content on WWE and Tapout channels, event sponsorships, as well as TV and in-store advertisements. The six performance body sprays come in a diverse range of scents from refreshing and crisp to spicy and musk – including Defy, Victory, Fuel, Focus, Core, and Control. Easy-to-use and high-quality, they are suitable for any occasion for men of all ages. “Motivation, discipline and determination are three values at the core of everything I do on both a personal and professional level,” said Cena. “Whether it’s after a workout, or before an event, Tapout Body Sprays are a great addition to my every day routine.” Cena is an actor, producer, host, entrepreneur and WWE Superstar. In addition to his work in the community, he is a powerhouse on social media with more than 43 million Facebook fans, making him the most popular active U.S. athlete on Facebook. He is also one of the most followed athletes on Twitter and Instagram with 9 and 6 million followers respectively. Cena devotes much of his time working on behalf of numerous charitable causes. He is Make-A-Wish’s most requested wish granter of all time and the only celebrity to grant 500 wishes. He is also committed to Susan G. Komen and has helped raise more than $2 million for breast cancer research and awareness. Cena is a longtime supporter of the U.S. military, recently recognized by USO Metro as the recipient of their 2016 Legacy of Achievement Award. He also starred in Ad Council’s 2016 Love Has No Labels campaign, ‘We Are America’ to further the message of acceptance and love for all communities across the United States. “Tapout Body Sprays put you directly in the moment of action, drive you to defy the odds and step up your game,” said Nelson Miranda, Vice President of Marketing, Global Fragrance at Elizabeth Arden. “As a man who exemplifies passion, confidence and motivation, John Cena is the ideal partner for Tapout Body Sprays. He knows what it takes to keep pushing forward no matter the obstacle.” “We are excited to launch Tapout into the personal care space,” notes Natasha Fishman, EVP of Marketing at Authentic Brands Group, who, in partnership with WWE, owns the Tapout brand. “Extending the brand into body sprays is a great next step for Tapout as it directly correlates to its brand essence which is to inspire the athlete in every individual.” Tapout Body Sprays are launching at WalMart stores and www.walmart.com in late May 2017 ($7.98).

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on: Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink: Purchase: Order Reprint HOBOKEN, N.J. – Even after an online spending spree, it might be hard for Wal-Mart to escape the Amazon in the room. Wal-Mart's acquisition of Jet.com and brands that appeal to younger shoppers gave it an e-commerce boost as it works to close the gap between itself and the online leader. The world's largest retailer is betting on essentials like fresh produce, and has adjusted its shipping strategy to better compete with Amazon's Prime program. But Amazon keeps innovating too, implementing new technology and trying to make shopping more convenient. Marc Lore, a co-founder of Jet.com who is now head of Wal-Mart's U.S. online operations, said he's confident about the company's momentum and there's plenty of room for it to thrive. "I can tell you we are happy with the moves we are making, and we are happy with the results," Lore said. "It's about moving fast. It's about innovating. And it's a very big market." He noted that e-commerce sales industrywide are still growing at 15 percent per year. Lore has led Wal-Mart's acquisitions of specialty online retailers like ModCloth, Moosejaw and ShoeBuy.com, and said he's still looking at companies that have expertise in categories where Wal-Mart wants to grow faster. As Wal-Mart prepares to show off some of its innovations this week before its shareholder meeting, there are signs that things are starting to click.

Wal-Mart’s acquisition of Jet.com is accelerating its progress in e-commerce as it works to narrow the gap between itself and online leader Amazon.

(AP Photo/Elaine Thompson, File) Sales at Walmart.com rose 63 percent in the first quarter, up from 29 percent growth in the previous quarter and marking its fourth straight quarter of increases. Its 4,700 stores are a strength for Wal-Mart, as they buck the larger retail trend in seeing increases in shopper numbers and sales. Despite its acquisitions, Wal-Mart said a majority of the increase was through Walmart.com and was fueled by changes in its shipping strategy and a discount for shoppers who pick up their online orders. Walmart.com now offers 50 million products, up from 10 million a year ago. In comparison, Amazon has hundreds of millions of products. David Spitz, CEO of e-commerce technology company ChannelAdvisor, said for some shoppers it has become ingrained that they start and finish their shopping at Amazon, and the Prime program reinforces that. He said Wal-Mart wasn't putting a sufficient emphasis on keeping up. "If anything, the gap was widening," Spitz said. "Jet.com was intended to be a jolt. Wal-Mart is clearly being more aggressive. There is a sense of urgency, but whether that is enough is the multibillion-dollar question." Amazon accounted for 33 percent of U.S. online sales last year, said research firm Euromonitor. Wal-Mart moved into second place ahead of eBay, with 7.8 percent. Greg Melich, an analyst at research firm Evercore, estimates that Amazon customers spend an average of $800 annually on the site, and members of its $99-a-year Prime program spend on average 2.7 times more than others. If Amazon's relationship with Prime members continues to grow, Melich said, then Amazon's path toward Wal-Mart's 9 percent of the total U.S. retail market from its current 3 percent is "reasonable." If Lore is worried, he doesn't acknowledge it. "We don't think specifically about Prime at all," he said. "We think we got a customer base — those customers who want to be able to save money and they want to be able to shop in different ways, whether it be direct-to-home, grocery pickup or going to the physical store."

Wal-Mart's acquisition of Jet.com and brands that appeal to younger shoppers have given it an e-commerce boost as it works to close the gap between itself and the online leader.

David Spitz, CEO of e-commerce technology company ChannelAdvisor, says for some shoppers it has become ingrained that they start and finish their shopping at Amazon, and the Prime program reinforces that. He said Wal-Mart wasn't putting a sufficient emphasis on keeping up. "If anything, the gap was widening," Spitz said. "Jet.com was intended to be a jolt. Wal-Mart is clearly being more aggressive. There is a sense of urgency, but whether that is enough is the multibillion-dollar question." Amazon accounted for 33 percent of U.S. online sales last year, according to the research firm Euromonitor. Wal-Mart moved into second place ahead of eBay, with 7.8 percent. Greg Melich, an analyst at research firm Evercore, estimates that Amazon customers spend an average of $800 annually on the site, and members of its $99-a-year Prime program spend on average 2.7 times more than others. If Amazon's relationship with Prime members continues to grow, Melich said recently, then Amazon's path toward Wal-Mart's 9 percent of the total U.S. retail market from its current 3 percent is "reasonable." If Lore is worried, he doesn't acknowledge it. "We don't think specifically about Prime at all," he said. "We think we (have) got a customer base — those customers who want to be able to save money and they want to be able to shop in different ways, whether it be direct-to-home, grocery pickup or going to the physical store." Its 4,700 stores are a strength for Wal-Mart, as they buck the larger retail trend in seeing increases in shopper numbers and sales. The discount for store pickup is helping bring shoppers in. Wal-Mart says even the expansion of stores with curbside pickup for groceries is also helping, since people often realize they forgot an item or two and run into the store. And as rivals like Target struggle to get their grocery departments right, Wal-Mart is placing a priority on essentials like peanut butter, paper towels and fresh produce that shoppers buy often. Amazon's stores are mainly showcases for gadgets, or are textbook- and furniture-pickup locations aimed at college students. But it keeps innovating, and it's testing an Amazon Go convenience store, where sensors track items as shoppers go and there's no need to check out. Amazon just opened its first bookstore in Manhattan and seventh overall. Moreover, Amazon also launched two grocery pickup kiosks in Seattle that allow Prime customers to buy fresh items online and pick it up in as little as 15 minutes instead of having them delivered. The service is free, and there's no order minimum. Shipping remains intensely competitive. Amazon Prime members in more than 5,000 cities and towns can receive orders the same day or the next, depending on the item and location. Through Prime Now, members in more than 30 cities can get some items in an hour or two. "We've had competition every day of our existence at Amazon and it's never changed our approach," Amazon says. "We obsess over customers and the things we believe customers will always care about — low prices, vast selection, and fast delivery." Wal-Mart has revamped its shipping program and now offers free, two-day shipping for online orders of its most popular items with a minimum purchase order of $35. Lore says Wal-Mart customers are placing more orders and spending more than before. In April, Wal-Mart launched a service called Easy Reorder where the items shoppers buy with their credit card at a store will pop up on their online account for replenishment. As more integration happens behind the scenes of Walmart.com and Jet.com, Lore says that over time, Jet's "smart cart" technology will be integrated into the Wal-Mart site. Jet was built on a real-time pricing algorithm that determines which sellers are the most efficient in value and shipping. It adjusts prices and encourages shoppers to buy certain items for more savings. Wal-Mart says it's helping people to shop smarter by encouraging them to build an order of $35 and offering extra discounts for store pickups of online orders. And Lore says the plan is to get to several hundred million products on Wal-Mart's website over the next few years. "We want to sell them everything," Lore said. "The assortment is growing fast," he said. "But we know in certain categories, we need to make more progress." ___ Follow Anne D'Innocenzio: http://twitter.com/ADInnocenzio Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File) Single page Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (3) Hoboken, N.J. • Even after an online spending spree, it may be hard for Wal-Mart to escape the Amazon in the room. Wal-Mart's acquisition of Jet.com and brands that appeal to younger shoppers have given it an e-commerce boost as it works to close the gap between itself and the online leader. The world's largest retailer is betting on essentials like cereal and diapers, and has adjusted its shipping strategy to better compete with Amazon's Prime program. But Amazon keeps innovating too, implementing new technology and trying to make shopping more convenient. Marc Lore, a co-founder of Jet.com who is now head of Wal-Mart's U.S. online operations, says he's confident about the company's momentum and that there's plenty of room for it to thrive. VIDEOS TOP JOBS "I can tell you we are happy with the moves we are making, and we are happy with the results," Lore said at the Jet headquarters in Hoboken, New Jersey. "It's about moving fast. It's about innovating. And it's a very big market." He noted that e-commerce sales industrywide are still growing 15 percent per year. Lore led Wal-Mart's acquisitions of specialty online retailers like ModCloth, Moosejaw and ShoeBuy.com, and said he's still looking at companies that have expertise in categories where Wal-Mart wants to grow faster. As Wal-Mart prepares to show off some of its innovations this week before its shareholder meeting, there are signs that things are starting to click. Sales at Walmart.com rose 63 percent in the first quarter, up from 29 percent growth in the previous quarter and marking its fourth straight quarter of increases. Wal-Mart said most of the increase was not through acquisitions but was fueled by changes in its shipping strategy and a discount for shoppers who pick up their online orders. Walmart.com now offers 50 million products including those from third-party sellers, up from 10 million a year ago. In comparison, Amazon has hundreds of millions of products.

He said Wal-Mart wasn't putting a sufficient emphasis on keeping up. "If anything, the gap was widening," Spitz said. "Jet.com was intended to be a jolt. Wal-Mart is clearly being more aggressive. There is a sense of urgency, but whether that is enough is the multibillion-dollar question."

Walmart’s acquisition of Jet.com and brands that appeal to younger shoppers have given it an e-commerce boost as it works to close the gap between itself and the online leader. The world’s largest retailer is betting on essentials like cereal and diapers, and has adjusted its shipping strategy to better compete with Amazon’s Prime program. But Amazon keeps innovating too, implementing new technology and trying to make shopping more convenient. Marc Lore, a co-founder of Jet.com who is now head of Walmart’s U.S. online operations, says he’s confident about the company’s momentum and that there’s plenty of room for it to thrive. “I can tell you we are happy with the moves we are making, and we are happy with the results,” Lore said at the Jet headquarters in Hoboken, New Jersey. “It’s about moving fast. It’s about innovating. And it’s a very big market.” He noted that e-commerce sales industrywide are still growing 15 percent per year. Business Channel Lore led Walmart’s acquisitions of specialty online retailers like ModCloth, Moosejaw and ShoeBuy.com, and said he’s still looking at companies that have expertise in categories where Walmart wants to grow faster. As Walmart prepares to show off some of its innovations this week before its shareholder meeting, there are signs that things are starting to click. Sales at Walmart.com rose 63 percent in the first quarter, up from 29 percent growth in the previous quarter and marking its fourth straight quarter of increases. Walmart said most of the increase was not through acquisitions but was fueled by changes in its shipping strategy and a discount for shoppers who pick up their online orders. Walmart.com now offers 50 million products including those from third-party sellers, up from 10 million a year ago. In comparison, Amazon has hundreds of millions of products. David Spitz, CEO of e-commerce technology company ChannelAdvisor, says for some shoppers it has become ingrained that they start and finish their shopping at Amazon, and the Prime program reinforces that. He said Walmart wasn’t putting a sufficient emphasis on keeping up. “If anything, the gap was widening,” Spitz said. “Jet.com was intended to be a jolt. Walmart is clearly being more aggressive. There is a sense of urgency, but whether that is enough is the multibillion-dollar question.” Amazon accounted for 33 percent of U.S. online sales last year, according to the research firm Euromonitor. Walmart moved into second place ahead of eBay, with 7.8 percent. Greg Melich, an analyst at research firm Evercore, estimates that Amazon customers spend an average of $800 annually on the site, and members of its $99-a-year Prime program spend on average 2.7 times more than others. If Amazon’s relationship with Prime members continues to grow, Melich said recently, then Amazon’s path toward Walmart’s 9 percent of the total U.S. retail market from its current 3 percent is “reasonable.” If Lore is worried, he doesn’t acknowledge it. “We don’t think specifically about Prime at all,” he said. “We think we (have) got a customer base — those customers who want to be able to save money and they want to be able to shop in different ways, whether it be direct-to-home, grocery pickup or going to the physical store.” Its 4,700 stores are a strength for Walmart, as they buck the larger retail trend in seeing increases in shopper numbers and sales. The discount for store pickup is helping bring shoppers in. Walmart says even the expansion of stores with curbside pickup for groceries is also helping, since people often realize they forgot an item or two and run into the store. And as rivals like Target struggle to get their grocery departments right, Walmart is placing a priority on essentials like peanut butter, paper towels and fresh produce that shoppers buy often. Amazon’s stores are mainly showcases for gadgets, or are textbook- and furniture-pickup locations aimed at college students. But it keeps innovating, and it’s testing an Amazon Go convenience store, where sensors track items as shoppers go and there’s no need to check out. Amazon just opened its first bookstore in Manhattan and seventh overall. Moreover, Amazon also launched two grocery pickup kiosks in Seattle that allow Prime customers to buy fresh items online and pick it up in as little as 15 minutes instead of having them delivered. The service is free, and there’s no order minimum. Shipping remains intensely competitive. Amazon Prime members in more than 5,000 cities and towns can receive orders the same day or the next, depending on the item and location. Through Prime Now, members in more than 30 cities can get some items in an hour or two. “We’ve had competition every day of our existence at Amazon and it’s never changed our approach,” Amazon says. “We obsess over customers and the things we believe customers will always care about — low prices, vast selection, and fast delivery.” Walmart has revamped its shipping program and now offers free, two-day shipping for online orders of its most popular items with a minimum purchase order of $35. Lore says Walmart customers are placing more orders and spending more than before. In April, Walmart launched a service called Easy Reorder where the items shoppers buy with their credit card at a store will pop up on their online account for replenishment. As more integration happens behind the scenes of Walmart.com and Jet.com, Lore says that over time, Jet’s “smart cart” technology will be integrated into the Walmart site. Jet was built on a real-time pricing algorithm that determines which sellers are the most efficient in value and shipping. It adjusts prices and encourages shoppers to buy certain items for more savings. Walmart says it’s helping people to shop smarter by encouraging them to build an order of $35 and offering extra discounts for store pickups of online orders. And Lore says the plan is to get to several hundred million products on Walmart’s website over the next few years. “We want to sell them everything,” Lore said. “The assortment is growing fast,” he said. “But we know in certain categories, we need to make more progress.”    Catch every San Antonio area moment!

A pedestrian passes in front of the new Amazon Go grocery store in Seattle, Wash., on Tuesday, Dec. 6, 2016. Credit: David Ryder/Bloomberg Most Popular Amazon.com Inc.'s shares topped $1,000 for the first time this morning, marking a new milestone for a company wooing investors by dominating online commerce and cloud computing. Amazon shares hit $1,001.20 in New York Tuesday, up about 40% from a year ago and more than double the 15% gain of the S&P 500 Index in the same period. Investors are thinking about how much further Amazon can grow as it tries to replicate its U.S. success abroad. The shares will likely push even higher since Amazon is growing so quickly in massive global industries that show no signs of slowing, as shopping habits change and businesses rethink how they deploy technology, said John Blackledge, analyst at Cowen and Company LLC, who recently upped his Amazon price target to $1,125 a share. "There's a long runway there," he said. "The markets Amazon is playing in with global retail and cloud computing are just massive. Things continue to go well and investors are looking for more upside." The Seattle company's $478 billion market value is double that of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. even though the world's biggest retailer will have sales three times larger than Amazon's this year. Investors put more value in Amazon's web traffic and delivery network than they do in Wal-Mart's vast store presence because online spending will grow more than four times faster than overall retail spending this year as shoppers continue to shift from stores to websites, according to EMarketer Inc. The world's largest online retailer is dominating e-commerce with its $99-a-year Amazon Prime subscription, which includes delivery discounts, music and video streaming and photo storage that keep shoppers engaged with the website. Seattle-based Amazon had 80 million Prime subscribers in the U.S. as of March 31, an increase of 38% from a year earlier, according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. Prime memberships help lock in loyalty, which is critical as competitors such as Wal-Mart enhance their e-commerce offerings to slow Amazon's momentum. Amazon has been tackling retail one category at a time, disrupting bookstores and electronics stores first and more recently pushing into apparel and groceries. Its rise has coincided with the decline of prominent retail chains such as Macy's and Sears, which have shuttered stores and laid off workers in response to declining sales. Shopping malls have resorted to hosting concerts and carnivals in empty parking lots to keep customers coming. Another Amazon advantage is its profitable and fast-growing cloud-computing division Amazon Web Services, which maintains a global network of data centers and rents out storage space and computing functions to clients in a variety of industries, including Netflix Inc. and Airbnb Inc. as well as Capital One Financial Corp. and the federal government. Yelp runs many of its functions on AWS. This year, companies around the world will funnel $246.8 billion to Amazon and other cloud services providers, according to Gartner, up 18% from 2016. Amazon's rise has made its founding CEO Jeff Bezos the world's second wealthiest person, behind only Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. His ascendancy has won praise from fellow self-made billionaires Warren Buffett and Mark Cuban, owner of the Dallas Mavericks and judge on the television show "Shark Tank." "Amazon is worth far more than $1,000 a share," said Cuban, an Amazon investor. "Consumers always want things at lower prices delivered faster. Amazon uses data better than anyone to achieve those goals for everything it sells. They have a chance to be the most dominant company in the world." --Spencer Soper, Bloomberg News In this article: CMO Strategy Digital Retail Technology Become a Member Register Now Renew Membership Benefits Datacenter Advertising Age     Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Instagram YouTube Tumblr Copyright © 1994-2017 Crain Communications Privacy Statement Terms of Use About Us Advertise Reprints Contact Us AD AGE Creativity LookBook Datacenter Resources Events Careers On Campus Site by AREA 17

In April, Wal-Mart launched a service called Easy Reorder where the items shoppers buy with their credit card at a store will pop up on their online account for replenishment. As more integration happens behind the scenes of Walmart.com and Jet.com, Lore says that over time, Jet's "smart cart" technology will be integrated into the Wal-Mart site. Jet was built on a real-time pricing algorithm that determines which sellers are the most efficient in value and shipping. It adjusts prices and encourages shoppers to buy certain items for more savings. Wal-Mart says it's helping people to shop smarter by encouraging them to build an order of $35 and offering extra discounts for store pickups of online orders. And Lore says the plan is to get to several hundred million products on Wal-Mart's website over the next few years. "We want to sell them everything," Lore said. "The assortment is growing fast," he said. "But we know in certain categories, we need to make more progress."

Walmart’s acquisition of Jet.com and brands that appeal to younger shoppers have given it an e-commerce boost as it works to close the gap between itself and the online leader. The world’s largest retailer is betting on essentials like cereal and diapers, and has adjusted its shipping strategy to better compete with Amazon’s Prime program. But Amazon keeps innovating too, implementing new technology and trying to make shopping more convenient. Marc Lore, a co-founder of Jet.com who is now head of Walmart’s U.S. online operations, says he’s confident about the company’s momentum and that there’s plenty of room for it to thrive. “I can tell you we are happy with the moves we are making, and we are happy with the results,” Lore said at the Jet headquarters in Hoboken, New Jersey. “It’s about moving fast. It’s about innovating. And it’s a very big market.” He noted that e-commerce sales industrywide are still growing 15 per cent per year. Lore led Walmart’s acquisitions of specialty online retailers like ModCloth, Moosejaw and ShoeBuy.com, and said he’s still looking at companies that have expertise in categories where Walmart wants to grow faster. As Walmart prepares to show off some of its innovations this week before its shareholder meeting, there are signs that things are starting to click. Sales at Walmart.com rose 63 per cent in the first quarter, up from 29 per cent growth in the previous quarter and marking its fourth straight quarter of increases. Wal,art said most of the increase was not through acquisitions but was fueled by changes in its shipping strategy and a discount for shoppers who pick up their online orders. Walmart.com now offers 50 million products including those from third-party sellers, up from 10 million a year ago. In comparison, Amazon has hundreds of millions of products. David Spitz, CEO of e-commerce technology company ChannelAdvisor, says for some shoppers it has become ingrained that they start and finish their shopping at Amazon, and the Prime program reinforces that. He said Walmart wasn’t putting a sufficient emphasis on keeping up. “If anything, the gap was widening,” Spitz said. “Jet.com was intended to be a jolt. Walmart is clearly being more aggressive. There is a sense of urgency, but whether that is enough is the multibillion-dollar question.” Amazon accounted for 33 per cent of U.S. online sales last year, according to the research firm Euromonitor. Walmart moved into second place ahead of eBay, with 7.8 per cent. Greg Melich, an analyst at research firm Evercore, estimates that Amazon customers spend an average of $800 annually on the site, and members of its $99-a-year Prime program spend on average 2.7 times more than others. If Amazon’s relationship with Prime members continues to grow, Melich said recently, then Amazon’s path toward Walmart’s 9 per cent of the total U.S. retail market from its current 3 per cent is “reasonable.” If Lore is worried, he doesn’t acknowledge it. “We don’t think specifically about Prime at all,” he said. “We think we (have) got a customer base—those customers who want to be able to save money and they want to be able to shop in different ways, whether it be direct-to-home, grocery pickup or going to the physical store.” Its 4,700 stores are a strength for Walmart, as they buck the larger retail trend in seeing increases in shopper numbers and sales. The discount for store pickup is helping bring shoppers in. Walmart says even the expansion of stores with curbside pickup for groceries is also helping, since people often realize they forgot an item or two and run into the store. And as rivals like Target struggle to get their grocery departments right, Walmart is placing a priority on essentials like peanut butter, paper towels and fresh produce that shoppers buy often. Amazon’s stores are mainly showcases for gadgets, or are textbook- and furniture-pickup locations aimed at college students. But it keeps innovating, and it’s testing an Amazon Go convenience store, where sensors track items as shoppers go and there’s no need to check out. Amazon just opened its first bookstore in Manhattan and seventh overall. Moreover, Amazon also launched two grocery pickup kiosks in Seattle that allow Prime customers to buy fresh items online and pick it up in as little as 15 minutes instead of having them delivered. The service is free, and there’s no order minimum. Shipping remains intensely competitive. Amazon Prime members in more than 5,000 cities and towns can receive orders the same day or the next, depending on the item and location. Through Prime Now, members in more than 30 cities can get some items in an hour or two. “We’ve had competition every day of our existence at Amazon and it’s never changed our approach,” Amazon says. “We obsess over customers and the things we believe customers will always care about—low prices, vast selection, and fast delivery.” Walmart has revamped its shipping program and now offers free, two-day shipping for online orders of its most popular items with a minimum purchase order of $35. Lore says Walmart customers are placing more orders and spending more than before. In April, Walmart launched a service called Easy Reorder where the items shoppers buy with their credit card at a store will pop up on their online account for replenishment.

By Kelly McSweeney for Robotics | May 30, 2017 -- 17:47 GMT (10:47 PDT) | Topic: Innovation (Image: US Patent & Trade Office) Walmart has submitted a patent application for a drone delivery system that focuses on how packages will be received. Instead of just delivering goods to your doorstep, drones would drop packages into secure boxes (lockers) that communicate with the drone. The application describes a smorgasbord of technology that could be used to ensure secure drop-off, including geofencing and a blockchain for package tracking and identification. Just like most patent applications, Walmart's "Unmanned Aerial Delivery to Secure Location" is jam-packed with redundant language, ambiguous line drawings, buzz words, and ample legal jargon. Still, the basic premise is clear: a delivery system that includes a robotic vehicle that communicates with a secure locker. While many retailers and logistics providers are scrambling to patent drone delivery systems, bitcoin news site Coindesk points out that this plan stands out because it uses blockchain technology. special report Download the Blockchain Guide You can this executive guide as a PDF (free registration required). Read More We keep hearing how a blockchain -- the secure digital ledger that underpins bitcoin -- will disrupt office work and eliminate the middle man in many industries by shifting the trust from an entity to software. (See: Blockchain explained in plain English for more). In this case, Walmart proposes using blockchains to streamline operations by tracking physical items. Drones would carry packages, and once they come close enough to the delivery box (as defined by geofencing or wireless communication), the box would automatically unlock itself and open robotically. For an added level of security and more precise tracking, blockchain technology could also be included. This could be especially helpful for sensitive or fragile shipments such as food, flowers, and medical samples. According to the patent application: Package tracking by blockchain may include elements including but not limited to location, supply chain transition, authentication of the courier and customer, ambient temperature of the container, temperature of the product if available, acceptable thresholds for ambient temperature of the product, package contents placed in the container system (products & goods), or a combination thereof. This is just one small example of how blockchains could be used for logistics. While the patent application's title and abstract describe a broader drone delivery system, blockchain technology is mentioned 21 times throughout the document.

For swimming, for example, Walmart just named Nathan Adrian, an American who won gold in the 2012 Olympic Games and bronze last year, to offer advice on everything from swim caps to goggles.   Adrian comes aboard at a time when Walmart has been aggressively buying up niche websites that specialize in shoes, outdoor gear, and other products to corner the market on specific segments of the online shopping public. “We want to be that place where the shopper can find anything that they need,’’ says Scott Hilton, chief revenue officer for Walmart U.S. eCommerce, “and that means we need to have specialty experience in every single shopping category.’’ Several retailers have taken steps to boost their expertise at a time when many store chains are struggling to woo shoppers amid increased competition from Amazon and other online sellers: •Target. The mass merchandiser found its own group of experts -- children between the ages of 7 and 14 -- to help shape its Art Class clothing collection, which debuted in January and was tailored to the 86 million teens and 'tweens who comprise Generation Z. •Toys R Us. The toy-selling giant, in revamping its website, will soon feature pages that not only sell car seats and strollers, but will educate new parents about which model or style best fits their needs. •Lowe’s. The nation's second-largest home improvement chain purchased online furniture and knick-knack seller ATG Stores in 2011. Load Error Walmart says that it will be hiring hundreds of specialists over the next two months in categories ranging from fishing gear to shoes. They will not only help select items, but have a say in the way that they are priced and displayed online. “The first step is all about the basics,’’ Adrian said in a statement. “I plan to review and expand the products we offer to make sure we have the right items for every type of swimmer, from the toddler learning how to swim . .. to the high school competitive swimmer needing a suit and equipment for training and meets.” To a big-box store chain like Walmart, which sells millions of products ranging from pants to peanut butter, depth of expertise is critical to make the best choices about what to offer in more specialized categories, Hilton says. The company has been on its own buying spree in recent months, starting with the purchase of online marketplace Jet, for $3 billion in August, which, in turn, bought footwear site ShoeBuy. Two months later, Walmart purchased Moosejaw, an online outdoor gear and clothing retailer. And in March, Walmart bought ModCloth, an online seller of women’s clothing and accessories that targets customers looking for full sizes. The sites maintained their same management teams, who were also put in charge of their particular product for Walmart's entire e-commerce network. Mike Sorabella, for instance, ShoeBuy's CEO, oversees footwear for all Walmart-owned sites. "They’re the experts,'' Hilton says. "They have all the brand relationships, so they’re managing footwear across the enterprise . . . This is the way we’re really accelerating that deeper knowledge in those specialty categories.''   Bringing in outsiders who understand a market niche could be a smart move, says Neil Saunders, managing director of retail analysis firm, Global Data. "People brought in often have a good external perspective which helps them to identify opportunities that those more involved in the business may not be able to do,'' he says. "Market and customer knowledge are often better which helps decision making around issues like styling and marketing.'' Farla Efros, president of the retail strategic firm HRC Retail Advisory, says that purchasing other sites is a strategic way for a traditional retailer like Walmart to strengthen its online operations. But a chain can specialize in only so many categories.  "Retailers need to differentiate and pick their spots . .  . given the picky consumer,'' Efros says, "but you cannot be experts in everything and they need to pick spots and do so with strong conviction.'' .   Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

Ryan Matthew Parsons, 30, was arrested Sunday afternoon near the east-side Walmart on charges of interference, trespass after warning, and shoplifting in an amount over $20. Two police officers went to the Walmart on Second Street after Parsons, referred to in court documents as a "known shoplifting suspect," left the store on foot. Parsons saw an officer approach and took off, running toward the rear of Walmart. The two Casper Police officers went after Parsons. Meanwhile, an Evansville officer radioed the officers and said Parsons was known to carry knives. Parsons reportedly reached into his pockets several times as he fled, and a Casper officer used his taser to gain control of Parsons before he could jump the fence to Interstate 25. A search of Parsons turned up a set of headphones, an audio cable, a USB charging cable, black carry bag and associated paperwork. Police also found an opened bag of peanut butter cups in Parsons' jacket pocket, and discovered he was wearing three pairs of jogging shorts. Parsons also had an orange Gerber knife in one pocket. Walmart staff knew Parsons to be a shoplifter. He was banned from the store for life in 2010. An employee watched Parsons as he allegedly stole items from the store. Parsons reportedly admitted to stealing from Walmart because he needed money for his niece's birthday present. He was not very coherent, police say, and told officers they were not going to take him to jail. As police drove Parsons to jail, he reportedly said he was trying to get one officer to shoot him by taking his knife out of his shorts. Parsons said he was unable to reach the knife.

(AP) - Even after an online spending spree, it may be hard for Wal-Mart to escape the Amazon in the room. Wal-Mart's acquisition of Jet.com and brands that appeal to younger shoppers have given it an e-commerce boost as it works to close the gap between itself and the online leader. The world's largest retailer is betting on essentials like cereal and diapers, and has adjusted its shipping strategy to better compete with Amazon's Prime program. But Amazon keeps innovating too, implementing new technology and trying to make shopping more convenient. FILE - In this Wednesday, Sept. 18, 2013, file photo, two Wal-Mart employees walk past a sign in the lobby at the Walmart.com office in San Bruno, Calif. Wal-Mart's acquisition of Jet.com is accelerating its progress in e-commerce as it works to narrow the gap between itself and online leader Amazon. Wal-Mart is betting its online future on essentials like produce and groceries and has adjusted its shipping strategy. But Amazon keeps innovating too. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File) Marc Lore, a co-founder of Jet.com who is now head of Wal-Mart's U.S. online operations, says he's confident about the company's momentum and that there's plenty of room for it to thrive. "I can tell you we are happy with the moves we are making, and we are happy with the results," Lore said at the Jet headquarters in Hoboken, New Jersey. "It's about moving fast. It's about innovating. And it's a very big market." He noted that e-commerce sales industrywide are still growing 15 percent per year. Lore led Wal-Mart's acquisitions of specialty online retailers like ModCloth, Moosejaw and ShoeBuy.com, and said he's still looking at companies that have expertise in categories where Wal-Mart wants to grow faster. As Wal-Mart prepares to show off some of its innovations this week before its shareholder meeting, there are signs that things are starting to click. Sales at Walmart.com rose 63 percent in the first quarter, up from 29 percent growth in the previous quarter and marking its fourth straight quarter of increases. Wal-Mart said most of the increase was not through acquisitions but was fueled by changes in its shipping strategy and a discount for shoppers who pick up their online orders. Walmart.com now offers 50 million products including those from third-party sellers, up from 10 million a year ago. In comparison, Amazon has hundreds of millions of products. David Spitz, CEO of e-commerce technology company ChannelAdvisor, says for some shoppers it has become ingrained that they start and finish their shopping at Amazon, and the Prime program reinforces that. He said Wal-Mart wasn't putting a sufficient emphasis on keeping up. "If anything, the gap was widening," Spitz said. "Jet.com was intended to be a jolt. Wal-Mart is clearly being more aggressive. There is a sense of urgency, but whether that is enough is the multibillion-dollar question." Amazon accounted for 33 percent of U.S. online sales last year, according to the research firm Euromonitor. Wal-Mart moved into second place ahead of eBay, with 7.8 percent. Greg Melich, an analyst at research firm Evercore, estimates that Amazon customers spend an average of $800 annually on the site, and members of its $99-a-year Prime program spend on average 2.7 times more than others. If Amazon's relationship with Prime members continues to grow, Melich said recently, then Amazon's path toward Wal-Mart's 9 percent of the total U.S. retail market from its current 3 percent is "reasonable." If Lore is worried, he doesn't acknowledge it. "We don't think specifically about Prime at all," he said. "We think we (have) got a customer base - those customers who want to be able to save money and they want to be able to shop in different ways, whether it be direct-to-home, grocery pickup or going to the physical store." Its 4,700 stores are a strength for Wal-Mart, as they buck the larger retail trend in seeing increases in shopper numbers and sales. The discount for store pickup is helping bring shoppers in. Wal-Mart says even the expansion of stores with curbside pickup for groceries is also helping, since people often realize they forgot an item or two and run into the store. And as rivals like Target struggle to get their grocery departments right, Wal-Mart is placing a priority on essentials like peanut butter, paper towels and fresh produce that shoppers buy often. Amazon's stores are mainly showcases for gadgets, or are textbook- and furniture-pickup locations aimed at college students. But it keeps innovating, and it's testing an Amazon Go convenience store, where sensors track items as shoppers go and there's no need to check out. Amazon just opened its first bookstore in Manhattan and seventh overall. Moreover, Amazon also launched two grocery pickup kiosks in Seattle that allow Prime customers to buy fresh items online and pick it up in as little as 15 minutes instead of having them delivered. The service is free, and there's no order minimum. Shipping remains intensely competitive. Amazon Prime members in more than 5,000 cities and towns can receive orders the same day or the next, depending on the item and location. Through Prime Now, members in more than 30 cities can get some items in an hour or two. "We've had competition every day of our existence at Amazon and it's never changed our approach," Amazon says. "We obsess over customers and the things we believe customers will always care about - low prices, vast selection, and fast delivery." Wal-Mart has revamped its shipping program and now offers free, two-day shipping for online orders of its most popular items with a minimum purchase order of $35. Lore says Wal-Mart customers are placing more orders and spending more than before. In April, Wal-Mart launched a service called Easy Reorder where the items shoppers buy with their credit card at a store will pop up on their online account for replenishment. As more integration happens behind the scenes of Walmart.com and Jet.com, Lore says that over time, Jet's "smart cart" technology will be integrated into the Wal-Mart site. Jet was built on a real-time pricing algorithm that determines which sellers are the most efficient in value and shipping. It adjusts prices and encourages shoppers to buy certain items for more savings. Wal-Mart says it's helping people to shop smarter by encouraging them to build an order of $35 and offering extra discounts for store pickups of online orders. And Lore says the plan is to get to several hundred million products on Wal-Mart's website over the next few years. "We want to sell them everything," Lore said. "The assortment is growing fast," he said. "But we know in certain categories, we need to make more progress." ___ Follow Anne D'Innocenzio: http://twitter.com/ADInnocenzio FILE - In this Monday, May 2, 2016, file photo, Jet.com CEO Marc Lore speaks during an interview in Hoboken, N.J.

Making Change at Walmart said Walmart is not paying employees a living wage, which results in the company's employees needing to rely on government assistance programs to survive. The group said the focus is on low wages, high turnover, and taxpayer waste. A single, full-time Walmart employee working 34 hours a week with 2 kids, still qualifies for Medicaid and food stamps even if they make Walmart's average hourly wage claim of $13.75, according to Making Change at Walmart. The group said it chose to hold the demonstration outside the National Civil Rights Museum because Martin Luther King Jr. worked "50 years ago for the sanitation workers' rights and 50 years later we're taking workers' rights away." "It's costing us $6.2 billion as taxpayers to support a full-time worker at Walmart," one protester said. The group said salary employees at Walmart get 12 weeks of maternity leave and hourly employees do not receive any maternity leave.  "This is exactly what Dr. King would want us to do," one protester said. The group called Walmart "un-American" because of the low wages and benefits. I'm proud to be with folks that want to encourage living wages for our folks out there," State Representative Dwayne Johnson (D-96). "I'm in the state legislature in Nashville, and I go there and say we need to raise the minimum wage and we need to give companies incentives for them to raise the wages." Johnson said when he speaks with businesses about raising the wages, they tell him they can't afford that and it would bankrupt their company.  "I'm proud of this group here and I hope people who hear about this and know about this will be encouraged to contact their elected officials, local, their state officials, and their federal officials, and put pressure on them to do the right thing for our working people out there," Johnson said.  The movement has stopped in 31 cities so far and they said their next stop is Arkansas. The group said it is headed to the shareholders meeting to let Walmart know that workers are not being paid livable wages or working in favorable conditions. "Really contribute more to the economy. With better wages we have a stronger Memphis, stronger Memphis metro area," Thompson said. Copyright 2017 WMC Action News 5. All rights reserved.

Fox News Fox Business Fox News Go Fox News Radio Fox Nation Fox News Insider   Welcome, {username} Profile | Login Fox News U.S. Expand/Collapse Search Home Video Politics U.S. Opinion Business Entertainment Tech Science Health Travel Lifestyle World On Air ECONOMY Wal-Mart works to close gap between itself and Amazon By ANNE D'INNOCENZIO Published May 30, 2017 Associated Press Facebook Twitter Email Print HOBOKEN, N.J. –  Even after an online spending spree, it may be hard for Wal-Mart to escape the Amazon in the room. Wal-Mart's acquisition of Jet.com and brands that appeal to younger shoppers have given it an e-commerce boost as it works to close the gap between itself and the online leader. The world's largest retailer is betting on essentials like cereal and diapers, and has adjusted its shipping strategy to better compete with Amazon's Prime program. But Amazon keeps innovating too, implementing new technology and trying to make shopping more convenient. Marc Lore, a co-founder of Jet.com who is now head of Wal-Mart's U.S. online operations, says he's confident about the company's momentum and that there's plenty of room for it to thrive. "I can tell you we are happy with the moves we are making, and we are happy with the results," Lore said at the Jet headquarters in Hoboken, New Jersey. "It's about moving fast. It's about innovating. And it's a very big market." He noted that e-commerce sales industrywide are still growing 15 percent per year. Lore led Wal-Mart's acquisitions of specialty online retailers like ModCloth, Moosejaw and ShoeBuy.com, and said he's still looking at companies that have expertise in categories where Wal-Mart wants to grow faster. As Wal-Mart prepares to show off some of its innovations this week before its shareholder meeting, there are signs that things are starting to click. Sales at Walmart.com rose 63 percent in the first quarter, up from 29 percent growth in the previous quarter and marking its fourth straight quarter of increases. Wal-Mart said most of the increase was not through acquisitions but was fueled by changes in its shipping strategy and a discount for shoppers who pick up their online orders. Walmart.com now offers 50 million products including those from third-party sellers, up from 10 million a year ago. In comparison, Amazon has hundreds of millions of products. David Spitz, CEO of e-commerce technology company ChannelAdvisor, says for some shoppers it has become ingrained that they start and finish their shopping at Amazon, and the Prime program reinforces that. He said Wal-Mart wasn't putting a sufficient emphasis on keeping up. "If anything, the gap was widening," Spitz said. "Jet.com was intended to be a jolt. Wal-Mart is clearly being more aggressive. There is a sense of urgency, but whether that is enough is the multibillion-dollar question." Amazon accounted for 33 percent of U.S. online sales last year, according to the research firm Euromonitor. Wal-Mart moved into second place ahead of eBay, with 7.8 percent. Greg Melich, an analyst at research firm Evercore, estimates that Amazon customers spend an average of $800 annually on the site, and members of its $99-a-year Prime program spend on average 2.7 times more than others. If Amazon's relationship with Prime members continues to grow, Melich said recently, then Amazon's path toward Wal-Mart's 9 percent of the total U.S. retail market from its current 3 percent is "reasonable." If Lore is worried, he doesn't acknowledge it. "We don't think specifically about Prime at all," he said. "We think we (have) got a customer base — those customers who want to be able to save money and they want to be able to shop in different ways, whether it be direct-to-home, grocery pickup or going to the physical store." Its 4,700 stores are a strength for Wal-Mart, as they buck the larger retail trend in seeing increases in shopper numbers and sales. The discount for store pickup is helping bring shoppers in. Wal-Mart says even the expansion of stores with curbside pickup for groceries is also helping, since people often realize they forgot an item or two and run into the store. And as rivals like Target struggle to get their grocery departments right, Wal-Mart is placing a priority on essentials like peanut butter, paper towels and fresh produce that shoppers buy often. Amazon's stores are mainly showcases for gadgets, or are textbook- and furniture-pickup locations aimed at college students. But it keeps innovating, and it's testing an Amazon Go convenience store, where sensors track items as shoppers go and there's no need to check out. Amazon just opened its first bookstore in Manhattan and seventh overall. Moreover, Amazon also launched two grocery pickup kiosks in Seattle that allow Prime customers to buy fresh items online and pick it up in as little as 15 minutes instead of having them delivered. The service is free, and there's no order minimum. Shipping remains intensely competitive. Amazon Prime members in more than 5,000 cities and towns can receive orders the same day or the next, depending on the item and location. Through Prime Now, members in more than 30 cities can get some items in an hour or two. "We've had competition every day of our existence at Amazon and it's never changed our approach," Amazon says. "We obsess over customers and the things we believe customers will always care about — low prices, vast selection, and fast delivery." Wal-Mart has revamped its shipping program and now offers free, two-day shipping for online orders of its most popular items with a minimum purchase order of $35. Lore says Wal-Mart customers are placing more orders and spending more than before. In April, Wal-Mart launched a service called Easy Reorder where the items shoppers buy with their credit card at a store will pop up on their online account for replenishment. As more integration happens behind the scenes of Walmart.com and Jet.com, Lore says that over time, Jet's "smart cart" technology will be integrated into the Wal-Mart site. Jet was built on a real-time pricing algorithm that determines which sellers are the most efficient in value and shipping. It adjusts prices and encourages shoppers to buy certain items for more savings. Wal-Mart says it's helping people to shop smarter by encouraging them to build an order of $35 and offering extra discounts for store pickups of online orders. And Lore says the plan is to get to several hundred million products on Wal-Mart's website over the next few years. "We want to sell them everything," Lore said. "The assortment is growing fast," he said. "But we know in certain categories, we need to make more progress." ___ Follow Anne D'Innocenzio: http://twitter.com/ADInnocenzio Advertisement Trending in US Mary Kay Letourneau's husband and former student reportedly files for separation US conducts successful missile intercept test, Pentagon says Christian geologist sues Grand Canyon for religious discrimination Mother, Good Samaritan die trying to save girl from raging river in Utah Illinois soldier gets airline ticket home, thanks to a stranger Site Index Sections Home Video Politics U.S. Opinion Entertainment Tech Science Health Travel Lifestyle World Sports Weather On Air Tools Live Video Newsletters Alerts Podcasts Radio Apps & Products About Careers College Students Fox Around the World Advertise With Us New Terms of Use (What's New) New Privacy Policy Ad Choices Help Email Newsroom Media Relations Closed Captioning Policy Follow Facebook Twitter Google+ Instagram RSS Newsletters Fox News Back to Top This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. 2017 FOX News Network, LLC.

(AP) — Even after an online spending spree, it may be hard for Wal-Mart to escape the Amazon in the room. Wal-Mart's acquisition of Jet.com and brands that appeal to younger shoppers have given it an e-commerce boost as it works to close the gap between itself and the online leader. The world's largest retailer is betting on essentials like cereal and diapers, and has adjusted its shipping strategy to better compete with Amazon's Prime program. But Amazon keeps innovating too, implementing new technology and trying to make shopping more convenient. Marc Lore, a co-founder of Jet.com who is now head of Wal-Mart's U.S. online operations, says he's confident about the company's momentum and that there's plenty of room for it to thrive. "I can tell you we are happy with the moves we are making, and we are happy with the results," Lore said at the Jet headquarters in Hoboken, New Jersey. "It's about moving fast. It's about innovating. And it's a very big market." He noted that e-commerce sales industrywide are still growing 15 percent per year. Lore led Wal-Mart's acquisitions of specialty online retailers like ModCloth, Moosejaw and ShoeBuy.com, and said he's still looking at companies that have expertise in categories where Wal-Mart wants to grow faster. As Wal-Mart prepares to show off some of its innovations this week before its shareholder meeting, there are signs that things are starting to click. Sales at Walmart.com rose 63 percent in the first quarter, up from 29 percent growth in the previous quarter and marking its fourth straight quarter of increases. Wal-Mart said most of the increase was not through acquisitions but was fueled by changes in its shipping strategy and a discount for shoppers who pick up their online orders. Walmart.com now offers 50 million products including those from third-party sellers, up from 10 million a year ago. In comparison, Amazon has hundreds of millions of products. David Spitz, CEO of e-commerce technology company ChannelAdvisor, says for some shoppers it has become ingrained that they start and finish their shopping at Amazon, and the Prime program reinforces that. He said Wal-Mart wasn't putting a sufficient emphasis on keeping up. "If anything, the gap was widening," Spitz said. "Jet.com was intended to be a jolt. Wal-Mart is clearly being more aggressive. There is a sense of urgency, but whether that is enough is the multibillion-dollar question." Amazon accounted for 33 percent of U.S. online sales last year, according to the research firm Euromonitor. Wal-Mart moved into second place ahead of eBay, with 7.8 percent. Greg Melich, an analyst at research firm Evercore, estimates that Amazon customers spend an average of $800 annually on the site, and members of its $99-a-year Prime program spend on average 2.7 times more than others. If Amazon's relationship with Prime members continues to grow, Melich said recently, then Amazon's path toward Wal-Mart's 9 percent of the total U.S. retail market from its current 3 percent is "reasonable." If Lore is worried, he doesn't acknowledge it. "We don't think specifically about Prime at all," he said. "We think we (have) got a customer base — those customers who want to be able to save money and they want to be able to shop in different ways, whether it be direct-to-home, grocery pickup or going to the physical store." Its 4,700 stores are a strength for Wal-Mart, as they buck the larger retail trend in seeing increases in shopper numbers and sales. The discount for store pickup is helping bring shoppers in. Wal-Mart says even the expansion of stores with curbside pickup for groceries is also helping, since people often realize they forgot an item or two and run into the store. And as rivals like Target struggle to get their grocery departments right, Wal-Mart is placing a priority on essentials like peanut butter, paper towels and fresh produce that shoppers buy often. Amazon's stores are mainly showcases for gadgets, or are textbook- and furniture-pickup locations aimed at college students. But it keeps innovating, and it's testing an Amazon Go convenience store, where sensors track items as shoppers go and there's no need to check out. Amazon just opened its first bookstore in Manhattan and seventh overall. Moreover, Amazon also launched two grocery pickup kiosks in Seattle that allow Prime customers to buy fresh items online and pick it up in as little as 15 minutes instead of having them delivered. The service is free, and there's no order minimum. Get breaking news sent instantly to your inbox Sign Up!

Amazon Prime members in more than 5,000 cities and towns can receive orders the same day or the next, depending on the item and location. Through Prime Now, members in more than 30 cities can get some items in an hour or two. "We've had competition every day of our existence at Amazon and it's never changed our approach," Amazon says. "We obsess over customers and the things we believe customers will always care about — low prices, vast selection, and fast delivery." Wal-Mart has revamped its shipping program and now offers free, two-day shipping for online orders of its most popular items with a minimum purchase order of $35. Lore says Wal-Mart customers are placing more orders and spending more than before. In April, Wal-Mart launched a service called Easy Reorder where the items shoppers buy with their credit card at a store will pop up on their online account for replenishment. As more integration happens behind the scenes of Walmart.com and Jet.com, Lore says that over time, Jet's "smart cart" technology will be integrated into the Wal-Mart site. Jet was built on a real-time pricing algorithm that determines which sellers are the most efficient in value and shipping. It adjusts prices and encourages shoppers to buy certain items for more savings. Wal-Mart says it's helping people to shop smarter by encouraging them to build an order of $35 and offering extra discounts for store pickups of online orders. And Lore says the plan is to get to several hundred million products on Wal-Mart's website over the next few years. "We want to sell them everything," Lore said. "The assortment is growing fast," he said. "But we know in certain categories, we need to make more progress." ___ Follow Anne D'Innocenzio: http://twitter.com/ADInnocenzio Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(Via OlyDrop) (Photo: Rob Schumacher/azcentral sports) 6 CONNECTTWEET 52 LINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE Walmart and other retailers are going for the gold against online giant Amazon by tapping experts to make sure they are stocking the best merchandise. The world's largest retailer is only the latest to drill down into categories by hiring hundreds of "category specialists" to sort through its offerings. For swimming, for example, Walmart just named Nathan Adrian, an American who won gold in the 2012 Olympic Games and bronze last year, to offer advice on everything from swim caps to goggles. Adrian comes aboard at a time when Walmart has been aggressively buying up niche websites that specialize in shoes, outdoor gear, and other products to corner the market on specific segments of the online shopping public. “We want to be that place where the shopper can find anything that they need,’’ says Scott Hilton, chief revenue officer for Walmart U.S. eCommerce, “and that means we need to have specialty experience in every single shopping category.’’ Several retailers have taken steps to boost their expertise at a time when many store chains are struggling to woo shoppers amid increased competition from Amazon and other online sellers: •Target. The mass merchandiser found its own group of experts -- children between the ages of 7 and 14 -- to help shape its Art Class clothing collection, which debuted in January and was tailored to the 86 million teens and 'tweens who comprise Generation Z. •Toys R Us. The toy-selling giant, in revamping its website, will soon feature pages that not only sell car seats and strollers, but will educate new parents about which model or style best fits their needs. •Lowe’s. The nation's second-largest home improvement chain purchased online furniture and knick-knack seller ATG Stores in 2011. Walmart says that it will be hiring hundreds of specialists over the next two months in categories ranging from fishing gear to shoes. They will not only help select items, but have a say in the way that they are priced and displayed online. “The first step is all about the basics,’’ Adrian said in a statement. “I plan to review and expand the products we offer to make sure we have the right items for every type of swimmer, from the toddler learning how to swim . .. to the high school competitive swimmer needing a suit and equipment for training and meets.” To a big-box store chain like Walmart, which sells millions of products ranging from pants to peanut butter, depth of expertise is critical to make the best choices about what to offer in more specialized categories, Hilton says. The company has been on its own buying spree in recent months, starting with the purchase of online marketplace Jet, for $3 billion in August, which, in turn, bought footwear site ShoeBuy. Two months later, Walmart purchased Moosejaw, an online outdoor gear and clothing retailer. And in March, Walmart bought ModCloth, an online seller of women’s clothing and accessories that targets customers looking for full sizes. The sites maintained their same management teams, who were also put in charge of their particular product for Walmart's entire e-commerce network. Mike Sorabella, for instance, ShoeBuy's CEO, oversees footwear for all Walmart-owned sites. "They’re the experts,'' Hilton says. "They have all the brand relationships, so they’re managing footwear across the enterprise . . . This is the way we’re really accelerating that deeper knowledge in those specialty categories.'' Bringing in outsiders who understand a market niche could be a smart move, says Neil Saunders, managing director of retail analysis firm, Global Data. "People brought in often have a good external perspective which helps them to identify opportunities that those more involved in the business may not be able to do,'' he says. "Market and customer knowledge are often better which helps decision making around issues like styling and marketing.'' Farla Efros, president of the retail strategic firm HRC Retail Advisory, says that purchasing other sites is a strategic way for a traditional retailer like Walmart to strengthen its online operations. But a chain can specialize in only so many categories. "Retailers need to differentiate and pick their spots . .  . given the picky consumer,'' Efros says, "but you cannot be experts in everything and they need to pick spots and do so with strong conviction.'' . 6 CONNECTTWEET 52 LINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2siz2X7

Consumers always want things at lower prices delivered faster. Amazon uses data better than anyone to achieve those goals for everything it sells. They have a chance to be the most dominant company in the world.” By various measures, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos is the second- or third-richest person in the world. Not bad for a tech guy who wanted to sell textbooks online. Alex Wong, Getty Images Advertisement Amazon.com Inc.’s shares topped $1,000 for the first time Tuesday, marking a new milestone for a company wooing investors by dominating online commerce and cloud computing. Amazon shares hit $1,001.20 in New York this morning, up about 40% from a year ago and more than double the 15% gain of the S&P 500 Index in the same period. Investors are thinking about how much further Amazon can grow as it tries to replicate its U.S. success abroad. The shares will likely push even higher since Amazon is growing so quickly in massive global industries that show no signs of slowing, as shopping habits change and businesses rethink how they deploy technology, said John Blackledge, analyst at Cowen and Company LLC, who recently upped his Amazon price target to $1,125 a share. “There’s a long runway there,” he said. “The markets Amazon is playing in with global retail and cloud computing are just massive. Things continue to go well and investors are looking for more upside.” Popular Now How to Set Up a Lean Factory That Works, Part 1 What Could be Done about China's Theft of Intellectual Property? How to Reduce Costs through Supply Chain Network Optimization The Seattle company’s $478 billion market value is double that of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. even though the world’s biggest retailer will have sales three times larger than Amazon’s this year. Investors put more value in Amazon’s web traffic and delivery network than they do in Wal-Mart’s vast store presence because online spending will grow more than four times faster than overall retail spending this year as shoppers continue to shift from stores to websites, according to EMarketer Inc. The world’s largest online retailer is dominating e-commerce with its $99 Amazon Prime annual subscription, which includes delivery discounts, music and video streaming and photo storage that keep shoppers engaged with the website. Amazon had 80 million Prime subscribers in the U.S. as of March 31, an increase of 38% from a year earlier, according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. Prime memberships help lock in loyalty, which is critical as competitors such as Wal-Mart enhance their e-commerce offerings to slow Amazon’s momentum. Amazon has been tackling retail one category at a time, disrupting bookstores and electronics stores first and more recently pushing into apparel and groceries. Its rise has coincided with the decline of prominent retail chains such as Macy’s Inc. and Sears Holdings Corp., which have shuttered stores and laid off workers in response to declining sales. Shopping malls have resorted to hosting concerts and carnivals in empty parking lots to keep customers coming. Another Amazon advantage is its profitable and fast-growing cloud-computing division Amazon Web Services, which maintains a global network of data centers and rents out storage space and computing functions to clients in a variety of industries, including Netflix Inc. and Airbnb Inc. as well as Capital One Financial Corp. and the federal government. Yelp runs many of its functions on AWS. This year, companies around the world will funnel $246.8 billion to Amazon and other cloud services providers, according to Gartner, up 18% from 2016.

Keep up with the manufacturing technology world with the M&T Newsletter, in your inbox every Friday morning Amazon’s rise has made its founding CEO Jeff Bezos the world’s second wealthiest person, behind only Microsoft Corp. co-founder Bill Gates, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. His ascendancy has won praise from fellow self-made billionaires Warren Buffett and Mark Cuban, owner of the Dallas Mavericks and a judge on the television show “Shark Tank.” “Amazon is worth far more than $1,000 a share,” said Cuban, an Amazon investor. “Consumers always want things at lower prices delivered faster. Amazon uses data better than anyone to achieve those goals for everything it sells. They have a chance to be the most dominant company in the world.” By Spencer Soper Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Please Log In or Register to post comments.

(AP) — Even after an online spending spree, it may be hard for Wal-Mart to escape the Amazon in the room. Wal-Mart's acquisition of Jet.com and brands that appeal to younger shoppers have given it an e-commerce boost as it works to close the gap between itself and the online leader. The world's largest retailer is betting on essentials like cereal and diapers, and has adjusted its shipping strategy to better compete with Amazon's Prime program. But Amazon keeps innovating too, implementing new technology and trying to make shopping more convenient. Marc Lore, a co-founder of Jet.com who is now head of Wal-Mart's U.S. online operations, says he's confident about the company's momentum and that there's plenty of room for it to thrive. "I can tell you we are happy with the moves we are making, and we are happy with the results," Lore said at the Jet headquarters in Hoboken, New Jersey. "It's about moving fast. It's about innovating. And it's a very big market." He noted that e-commerce sales industrywide are still growing 15 percent per year. Lore led Wal-Mart's acquisitions of specialty online retailers like ModCloth, Moosejaw and ShoeBuy.com, and said he's still looking at companies that have expertise in categories where Wal-Mart wants to grow faster. As Wal-Mart prepares to show off some of its innovations this week before its shareholder meeting, there are signs that things are starting to click. Sales at Walmart.com rose 63 percent in the first quarter, up from 29 percent growth in the previous quarter and marking its fourth straight quarter of increases. Wal-Mart said most of the increase was not through acquisitions but was fueled by changes in its shipping strategy and a discount for shoppers who pick up their online orders. Walmart.com now offers 50 million products including those from third-party sellers, up from 10 million a year ago. In comparison, Amazon has hundreds of millions of products. David Spitz, CEO of e-commerce technology company ChannelAdvisor, says for some shoppers it has become ingrained that they start and finish their shopping at Amazon, and the Prime program reinforces that. He said Wal-Mart wasn't putting a sufficient emphasis on keeping up. "If anything, the gap was widening," Spitz said. "Jet.com was intended to be a jolt. Wal-Mart is clearly being more aggressive. There is a sense of urgency, but whether that is enough is the multibillion-dollar question." Amazon accounted for 33 percent of U.S. online sales last year, according to the research firm Euromonitor. Wal-Mart moved into second place ahead of eBay, with 7.8 percent. Greg Melich, an analyst at research firm Evercore, estimates that Amazon customers spend an average of $800 annually on the site, and members of its $99-a-year Prime program spend on average 2.7 times more than others. If Amazon's relationship with Prime members continues to grow, Melich said recently, then Amazon's path toward Wal-Mart's 9 percent of the total U.S. retail market from its current 3 percent is "reasonable." If Lore is worried, he doesn't acknowledge it. "We don't think specifically about Prime at all," he said. "We think we (have) got a customer base — those customers who want to be able to save money and they want to be able to shop in different ways, whether it be direct-to-home, grocery pickup or going to the physical store." Its 4,700 stores are a strength for Wal-Mart, as they buck the larger retail trend in seeing increases in shopper numbers and sales. The discount for store pickup is helping bring shoppers in. Wal-Mart says even the expansion of stores with curbside pickup for groceries is also helping, since people often realize they forgot an item or two and run into the store. And as rivals like Target struggle to get their grocery departments right, Wal-Mart is placing a priority on essentials like peanut butter, paper towels and fresh produce that shoppers buy often. Amazon's stores are mainly showcases for gadgets, or are textbook- and furniture-pickup locations aimed at college students. But it keeps innovating, and it's testing an Amazon Go convenience store, where sensors track items as shoppers go and there's no need to check out. Amazon just opened its first bookstore in Manhattan and seventh overall. Moreover, Amazon also launched two grocery pickup kiosks in Seattle that allow Prime customers to buy fresh items online and pick it up in as little as 15 minutes instead of having them delivered. The service is free, and there's no order minimum. Shipping remains intensely competitive. Amazon Prime members in more than 5,000 cities and towns can receive orders the same day or the next, depending on the item and location. Through Prime Now, members in more than 30 cities can get some items in an hour or two. "We've had competition every day of our existence at Amazon and it's never changed our approach," Amazon says. "We obsess over customers and the things we believe customers will always care about — low prices, vast selection, and fast delivery." Wal-Mart has revamped its shipping program and now offers free, two-day shipping for online orders of its most popular items with a minimum purchase order of $35. Lore says Wal-Mart customers are placing more orders and spending more than before. In April, Wal-Mart launched a service called Easy Reorder where the items shoppers buy with their credit card at a store will pop up on their online account for replenishment. As more integration happens behind the scenes of Walmart.com and Jet.com, Lore says that over time, Jet's "smart cart" technology will be integrated into the Wal-Mart site. Jet was built on a real-time pricing algorithm that determines which sellers are the most efficient in value and shipping. It adjusts prices and encourages shoppers to buy certain items for more savings. Wal-Mart says it's helping people to shop smarter by encouraging them to build an order of $35 and offering extra discounts for store pickups of online orders. And Lore says the plan is to get to several hundred million products on Wal-Mart's website over the next few years. "We want to sell them everything," Lore said. "The assortment is growing fast," he said. "But we know in certain categories, we need to make more progress." ___ Follow Anne D'Innocenzio: http://twitter.com/ADInnocenzio Get news headlines sent daily to your inbox Sign Up!

More Comments Tumblr Pinterest Reddit Digg FarkIt StumbleUpon Amazon.com Inc.’s shares topped US$1,000 for the first time, marking a new milestone for a company wooing investors by dominating online commerce and cloud computing, two industries expected to keep growing as shopping habits change and businesses rethink how they deploy technology. Amazon shares hit US$1,001.20 in New York Tuesday, up about 40 per cent from a year ago and more than double the 15 per cent gain of the S&P 500 Index in the same period. Investors are thinking about how much further Amazon can grow as it tries to replicate its U.S. success abroad. The shares will likely push even higher since Amazon is growing so quickly in massive global industries that show no signs of slowing, said John Blackledge, analyst at Cowen and Company LLC, who recently upped his Amazon price target to US$1,125 a share. Related As Amazon .com Inc continues its Canadian push, retailers are being forced to step up their e-commerce game Amazon is dominating Google in the U.S. voice-activated speaker race with 71% of the market: report “There’s a long runway there,” he said. “The markets Amazon is playing in with global retail and cloud computing are just massive.

Wal-Mart's acquisition of Jet.com is accelerating its progress in e-commerce as it works to narrow the gap between itself and online leader Amazon. Wal-Mart is betting its online future on essentials like produce and groceries and has adjusted its shipping strategy. But Amazon keeps innovating too. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File) .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... DEVELOPING STORY — This story will be updated as new information becomes available. HOBOKEN, N.J. — Even after an online spending spree, it may be hard for Wal-Mart to escape the Amazon in the room. Wal-Mart’s acquisition of Jet.com and brands that appeal to younger shoppers have given it an e-commerce boost as it works to close the gap between itself and the online leader. The world’s largest retailer is betting on essentials like cereal and diapers, and has adjusted its shipping strategy to better compete with Amazon’s Prime program. But Amazon keeps innovating too, implementing new technology and trying to make shopping more convenient. Advertisement Continue reading Marc Lore, a co-founder of Jet.com who is now head of Wal-Mart’s U.S. online operations, says he’s confident about the company’s momentum and that there’s plenty of room for it to thrive. “I can tell you we are happy with the moves we are making, and we are happy with the results,” Lore said at the Jet headquarters in Hoboken, New Jersey. “It’s about moving fast. It’s about innovating. And it’s a very big market.” He noted that e-commerce sales industrywide are still growing 15 percent per year. Lore led Wal-Mart’s acquisitions of specialty online retailers like ModCloth, Moosejaw and ShoeBuy.com, and said he’s still looking at companies that have expertise in categories where Wal-Mart wants to grow faster. As Wal-Mart prepares to show off some of its innovations this week before its shareholder meeting, there are signs that things are starting to click. Sales at Walmart.com rose 63 percent in the first quarter, up from 29 percent growth in the previous quarter and marking its fourth straight quarter of increases. Wal-Mart said most of the increase was not through acquisitions but was fueled by changes in its shipping strategy and a discount for shoppers who pick up their online orders. Walmart.com now offers 50 million products including those from third-party sellers, up from 10 million a year ago. In comparison, Amazon has hundreds of millions of products. David Spitz, CEO of e-commerce technology company ChannelAdvisor, says for some shoppers it has become ingrained that they start and finish their shopping at Amazon, and the Prime program reinforces that. He said Wal-Mart wasn’t putting a sufficient emphasis on keeping up. “If anything, the gap was widening,” Spitz said. “Jet.com was intended to be a jolt. Wal-Mart is clearly being more aggressive. There is a sense of urgency, but whether that is enough is the multibillion-dollar question.” Amazon accounted for 33 percent of U.S. online sales last year, according to the research firm Euromonitor. Wal-Mart moved into second place ahead of eBay, with 7.8 percent. Greg Melich, an analyst at research firm Evercore, estimates that Amazon customers spend an average of $800 annually on the site, and members of its $99-a-year Prime program spend on average 2.7 times more than others. Advertisement Continue reading If Amazon’s relationship with Prime members continues to grow, Melich said recently, then Amazon’s path toward Wal-Mart’s 9 percent of the total U.S. retail market from its current 3 percent is “reasonable.” If Lore is worried, he doesn’t acknowledge it. “We don’t think specifically about Prime at all,” he said. “We think we (have) got a customer base — those customers who want to be able to save money and they want to be able to shop in different ways, whether it be direct-to-home, grocery pickup or going to the physical store.” Its 4,700 stores are a strength for Wal-Mart, as they buck the larger retail trend in seeing increases in shopper numbers and sales. The discount for store pickup is helping bring shoppers in. Wal-Mart says even the expansion of stores with curbside pickup for groceries is also helping, since people often realize they forgot an item or two and run into the store. And as rivals like Target struggle to get their grocery departments right, Wal-Mart is placing a priority on essentials like peanut butter, paper towels and fresh produce that shoppers buy often. Amazon’s stores are mainly showcases for gadgets, or are textbook- and furniture-pickup locations aimed at college students. But it keeps innovating, and it’s testing an Amazon Go convenience store, where sensors track items as shoppers go and there’s no need to check out. Amazon just opened its first bookstore in Manhattan and seventh overall. Moreover, Amazon also launched two grocery pickup kiosks in Seattle that allow Prime customers to buy fresh items online and pick it up in as little as 15 minutes instead of having them delivered. The service is free, and there’s no order minimum. Shipping remains intensely competitive. Amazon Prime members in more than 5,000 cities and towns can receive orders the same day or the next, depending on the item and location. Through Prime Now, members in more than 30 cities can get some items in an hour or two. “We’ve had competition every day of our existence at Amazon and it’s never changed our approach,” Amazon says. “We obsess over customers and the things we believe customers will always care about — low prices, vast selection, and fast delivery.” Wal-Mart has revamped its shipping program and now offers free, two-day shipping for online orders of its most popular items with a minimum purchase order of $35. Lore says Wal-Mart customers are placing more orders and spending more than before. In April, Wal-Mart launched a service called Easy Reorder where the items shoppers buy with their credit card at a store will pop up on their online account for replenishment. As more integration happens behind the scenes of Walmart.com and Jet.com, Lore says that over time, Jet’s “smart cart” technology will be integrated into the Wal-Mart site. Jet was built on a real-time pricing algorithm that determines which sellers are the most efficient in value and shipping. It adjusts prices and encourages shoppers to buy certain items for more savings. Wal-Mart says it’s helping people to shop smarter by encouraging them to build an order of $35 and offering extra discounts for store pickups of online orders. And Lore says the plan is to get to several hundred million products on Wal-Mart’s website over the next few years. “We want to sell them everything,” Lore said. “The assortment is growing fast,” he said. “But we know in certain categories, we need to make more progress.” ___ Follow Anne D’Innocenzio: http://twitter.com/ADInnocenzio Share Tweet LinkedIn Email Print Subscribe Most Recent Biz News Retail Suggested Stories: Wal-Mart completes $3 billion-plus purchase of Jet.com – Sep 19, 2016 Wal-Mart dumps its version of Amazon Prime for new path – Jan 31, 2017 Wal-Mart keeps working to make inroads against Amazon – Feb 21, 2017 Wal-Mart sees online sales surge, more shoppers at stores – May 18, 2017 Advertisement Load comments Comments Subscribe to the Journal for only $12.

Online retail giant Amazon.com traded above $1,000 a share for the first time. Photo: Richard Drew /Associated Press Amazon shares hit $1,000, showing dominance of e-commerce 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Amazon.com Inc.’s shares topped $1,000 for the first time, marking a new milestone for a company wooing investors by dominating online commerce and cloud computing, two industries expected to keep growing as shopping habits change and businesses rethink how they deploy technology. Amazon shares hit $1,001.20 in New York Tuesday, up about 40 percent from a year ago and more than double the 15 percent gain of the S&P 500 Index in the same period. Investors are thinking about how much further Amazon can grow as it tries to replicate its U.S. success abroad. The shares will likely push even higher since Amazon is growing so quickly in massive global industries that show no signs of slowing, said John Blackledge, analyst at Cowen and Company LLC, who recently upped his Amazon price target to $1,125 a share. “There’s a long runway there,” he said. “The markets Amazon is playing in with global retail and cloud computing are just massive. Things continue to go well and investors are looking for more upside.” The Seattle company’s $478 billion market value is double that of Walmart Stores Inc. even though the world’s biggest retailer will have sales three times larger than Amazon’s this year. Investors put more value in Amazon’s web traffic and delivery network than they do in Wal-Mart’s vast store presence because online spending will grow more than four times faster than overall retail spending this year as shoppers continue to shift from stores to websites, according to EMarketer Inc. The world’s largest online retailer is dominating e-commerce with its $99-a-year Amazon Prime subscription, which includes delivery discounts, music and video streaming and photo storage that keep shoppers engaged with the website. Seattle-based Amazon had 80 million Prime subscribers in the U.S. as of March 31, an increase of 38 percent from a year earlier, according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. Prime memberships help lock in loyalty, which is critical as competitors such as Walmart enhance their e-commerce offerings to slow Amazon’s momentum. Business Channel Amazon has been tackling retail one category at a time, disrupting bookstores and electronics stores first and more recently pushing into apparel and groceries. Its rise has coincided with the decline of prominent retail chains such as Macy’s Inc. and Sears Holdings Corp., which have shuttered stores and laid off workers in response to declining sales. Shopping malls have resorted to hosting concerts and carnivals in empty parking lots to keep customers coming. Another Amazon advantage is its profitable and fast-growing cloud-computing division Amazon Web Services, which maintains a global network of data centers and rents out storage space and computing functions to clients in a variety of industries, including Netflix Inc. and Airbnb Inc. as well as Capital One Financial Corp. and the federal government. Yelp runs many of its functions on AWS. This year, companies around the world will funnel $246.8 billion to Amazon and other cloud services providers, according to Gartner, up 18 percent from 2016. Amazon’s rise has made its founding Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos the world’s second wealthiest person, behind only Microsoft Corp. co-founder Bill Gates, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. His ascendancy has won praise from fellow self-made billionaires Warren Buffett and Mark Cuban, owner of the Dallas Mavericks and judge on the television show “Shark Tank.” “Amazon is worth far more than $1,000 a share,” said Cuban, an Amazon investor. “Consumers always want things at lower prices delivered faster. Amazon uses data better than anyone to achieve those goals for everything it sells. They have a chance to be the most dominant company in the world.”    Catch every San Antonio area moment!

Wal-Mart‚Äôs acquisition of Jet.com is accelerating its progress in e-commerce as it works to narrow the gap between itself and online leader Amazon. Wal-Mart is betting its online future on essentials like produce and groceries and has adjusted its shipping strategy. But Amazon keeps innovating too. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File) By: Anne D'Innocenzio The Associated Press Published on HOBOKEN, N.J. — Even after an online spending spree, it may be hard for Wal-Mart to escape the Amazon in the room. Wal-Mart's acquisition of Jet.com and brands that appeal to younger shoppers have given it an e-commerce boost as it works to close the gap between itself and the online leader. The world's largest retailer is betting on essentials like cereal and diapers, and has adjusted its shipping strategy to better compete with Amazon's Prime program. But Amazon keeps innovating too, implementing new technology and trying to make shopping more convenient. Marc Lore, a co-founder of Jet.com who is now head of Wal-Mart's U.S. online operations, says he's confident about the company's momentum and that there's plenty of room for it to thrive. "I can tell you we are happy with the moves we are making, and we are happy with the results," Lore said at the Jet headquarters in Hoboken, New Jersey. "It's about moving fast. It's about innovating. And it's a very big market." He noted that e-commerce sales industrywide are still growing 15 per cent per year. Lore led Wal-Mart's acquisitions of specialty online retailers like ModCloth, Moosejaw and ShoeBuy.com, and said he's still looking at companies that have expertise in categories where Wal-Mart wants to grow faster. As Wal-Mart prepares to show off some of its innovations this week before its shareholder meeting, there are signs that things are starting to click. Sales at Walmart.com rose 63 per cent in the first quarter, up from 29 per cent growth in the previous quarter and marking its fourth straight quarter of increases. Wal-Mart said most of the increase was not through acquisitions but was fueled by changes in its shipping strategy and a discount for shoppers who pick up their online orders. Walmart.com now offers 50 million products including those from third-party sellers, up from 10 million a year ago. In comparison, Amazon has hundreds of millions of products. David Spitz, CEO of e-commerce technology company ChannelAdvisor, says for some shoppers it has become ingrained that they start and finish their shopping at Amazon, and the Prime program reinforces that. He said Wal-Mart wasn't putting a sufficient emphasis on keeping up. "If anything, the gap was widening," Spitz said. "Jet.com was intended to be a jolt. Wal-Mart is clearly being more aggressive. There is a sense of urgency, but whether that is enough is the multibillion-dollar question." Amazon accounted for 33 per cent of U.S. online sales last year, according to the research firm Euromonitor. Wal-Mart moved into second place ahead of eBay, with 7.8 per cent . Greg Melich, an analyst at research firm Evercore, estimates that Amazon customers spend an average of $800 annually on the site, and members of its $99-a-year Prime program spend on average 2.7 times more than others. If Amazon's relationship with Prime members continues to grow, Melich said recently, then Amazon's path toward Wal-Mart's 9 per cent of the total U.S. retail market from its current 3 per cent is "reasonable." If Lore is worried, he doesn't acknowledge it. "We don't think specifically about Prime at all," he said. "We think we (have) got a customer base — those customers who want to be able to save money and they want to be able to shop in different ways, whether it be direct-to-home, grocery pickup or going to the physical store." Its 4,700 stores are a strength for Wal-Mart, as they buck the larger retail trend in seeing increases in shopper numbers and sales. The discount for store pickup is helping bring shoppers in. Wal-Mart says even the expansion of stores with curbside pickup for groceries is also helping, since people often realize they forgot an item or two and run into the store. And as rivals like Target struggle to get their grocery departments right, Wal-Mart is placing a priority on essentials like peanut butter, paper towels and fresh produce that shoppers buy often. Amazon's stores are mainly showcases for gadgets, or are textbook- and furniture-pickup locations aimed at college students. But it keeps innovating, and it's testing an Amazon Go convenience store, where sensors track items as shoppers go and there's no need to check out. Amazon just opened its first bookstore in Manhattan and seventh overall. Moreover, Amazon also launched two grocery pickup kiosks in Seattle that allow Prime customers to buy fresh items online and pick it up in as little as 15 minutes instead of having them delivered. The service is free, and there's no order minimum. Shipping remains intensely competitive. Amazon Prime members in more than 5,000 cities and towns can receive orders the same day or the next, depending on the item and location. Through Prime Now, members in more than 30 cities can get some items in an hour or two. "We've had competition every day of our existence at Amazon and it's never changed our approach," Amazon says. "We obsess over customers and the things we believe customers will always care about — low prices, vast selection, and fast delivery." Wal-Mart has revamped its shipping program and now offers free, two-day shipping for online orders of its most popular items with a minimum purchase order of $35. Lore says Wal-Mart customers are placing more orders and spending more than before. In April, Wal-Mart launched a service called Easy Reorder where the items shoppers buy with their credit card at a store will pop up on their online account for replenishment. As more integration happens behind the scenes of Walmart.com and Jet.com, Lore says that over time, Jet's "smart cart" technology will be integrated into the Wal-Mart site. Jet was built on a real-time pricing algorithm that determines which sellers are the most efficient in value and shipping. It adjusts prices and encourages shoppers to buy certain items for more savings. Wal-Mart says it's helping people to shop smarter by encouraging them to build an order of $35 and offering extra discounts for store pickups of online orders. And Lore says the plan is to get to several hundred million products on Wal-Mart's website over the next few years. "We want to sell them everything," Lore said. "The assortment is growing fast," he said. "But we know in certain categories, we need to make more progress." ___ Follow Anne D'Innocenzio: http://twitter.com/ADInnocenzio Editors' Picks Pulling trucks and lifting boulders: Calgary women train for Strongman competition Wonder Woman: The film and its star live up to a lofty name Meet the new King of the Island, the peacock named Eyeball 'You are Beautiful': Bedford girl pens poem to tackle bullying and body shaming More on Metronews.ca Most Popular Backlash after shutdown of CBE trustee candidate’s Twitter account Calgary teacher arrested for alleged sexual contact with a student Unofficial Nova Scotia election results in HRM districts WWII grenades bought at German flea market explode in summer heat Back to Mobile About About Us Contact Careers RSS Feeds Terms Advertising Terms Terms and Conditions Privacy Code Metronews.ca My Metro Store Contests Metro Panel Special Features FAQ © Copyright Free Daily News Group Inc. 2001-2017 Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy

As more integration happens behind the scenes of Walmart.com and Jet.com, Lore says that over time, Jet’s “smart cart” technology will be integrated into the Wal-Mart site. Jet was built on a real-time pricing algorithm that determines which sellers are the most efficient in value and shipping. It adjusts prices and encourages shoppers to buy certain items for more savings. Wal-Mart says it’s helping people to shop smarter by encouraging them to build an order of $35 and offering extra discounts for store pickups of online orders. And Lore says the plan is to get to several hundred million products on Wal-Mart’s website over the next few years. “We want to sell them everything,” Lore said. “The assortment is growing fast,” he said. “But we know in certain categories, we need to make more progress.” ___ Follow Anne D’Innocenzio: http://twitter.com/ADInnocenzio Related Topics Business News U.S. News Leave A Comment Home » The Associated Press » Business News » Wal-Mart works to close… Partners FEDERAL INSIGHTS The Associated Press Government News U.S. News Business News World News Technology News Entertainment News Sports News Top Stories Senior OSC employee blows the whistle on whistleblower protection agency Top Story 12 key takeaways from the 2018 budget that could affect you Budget Cuts to EPA’s workforce harm the agency’s mission — or do they?

(AP) - Even after an online spending spree, it may be hard for Wal-Mart to escape the Amazon in the room. Wal-Mart's acquisition of Jet.com and brands that appeal to younger shoppers gave it an e-commerce boost as it works to close the gap with the online leader. The world's largest retailer is betting on essentials like fresh produce and groceries, and has adjusted its shipping strategy to better compete with Amazon's juggernaut Prime program. But Amazon keeps innovating too, implementing new technology and trying to make shopping more convenient. Marc Lore, a co-founder of Jet.com who is now head of Wal-Mart's U.S. online operations, says he's confident about the company's momentum, which comes as Wal-Mart prepares to show off some of its innovations at the company's shareholder meeting this week.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    Amazon.com Inc., the e-commerce giant that has changed how much of the world shops for books, toilet paper and TVs, has hit yet another milestone. Amazon stock hit $1,001.20 shortly after Tuesday's opening bell, up about 40 percent from a year ago and more than double the 15 percent gain of the S&P 500 Index in the same period. Investors are thinking about how much further Amazon can grow as it tries to replicate its U.S. success abroad, Bloomberg reported. The $1,000 share price also puts Amazon's market value at about $478 billion, double that of rival Wal-Mart and more than 15 times the size of Target, the Associated Press reported. The shares will likely push even higher since Amazon is growing so quickly in massive global industries that show no signs of slowing, as shopping habits change and businesses rethink how they deploy technology, said John Blackledge, analyst at Cowen and Company LLC, who recently upped his Amazon price target to $1,125 a share. "There’s a long runway there," he told Bloomberg. "The markets Amazon is playing in with global retail and cloud computing are just massive. Things continue to go well and investors are looking for more upside." Meanwhile, only 14 other U.S. stocks trade above $1,000 per share, FactSet reported, and the only other tech company in the club is Priceline Group, currently trading around $1,865. Amazon also is more than four times more valuable than those other 14 companies combined, CNBC.com explained. Meanwhile, Alphabet’s Class A shares are currently trading above $990. Amazon has come a long way since its start in 1995, when it mostly sold books. The Seattle company now sells just about anything, from groceries to small appliances, and has been blamed for taking business away from department stores, supermarkets and clothing retailers. “Amazon has split three times since its IPO in 1997. In 1998, it issued a two-for-one stock split. In January 1999, it issued a three-for-one stock split and, in September 1999, it issued a two-for-one split. When Amazon hit $1,000, it's technically the equivalent of a $12,000 share price in today's terms,” CNBC reported. For its part, Amazon's ventures far beyond online retail, from cloud computing to movie making, are raising questions among corporate strategy experts about its focus, Reuters reported. The Seattle-based company wowed Wall Street recently with a 23 percent jump in sales, pushing its shares to an all-time high. But there are concerns that if blockbuster growth stops, investors may come to regard the company more like a conglomerate stock - worth less than the sum of its pieces, Reuters reported. "High growth covers a lot of sins," said Harry Kraemer, a partner at private equity firm Madison Dearborn Partners and a professor at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management. Investors also put more value in Amazon’s web traffic and delivery network than they do in Wal-Mart’s vast store presence because online spending will grow more than four times faster than overall retail spending this year as shoppers continue to shift from stores to websites, Bloomberg reported, citing EMarketer Inc. The world’s largest online retailer is dominating e-commerce with its $99-a-year Amazon Prime subscription, which includes delivery discounts, music and video streaming and photo storage that keep shoppers engaged with the website. Amazon had 80 million Prime subscribers in the U.S. as of March 31, an increase of 38 percent from a year earlier, according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. Prime memberships help lock in loyalty, which is critical as competitors such as Wal-Mart enhance their e-commerce offerings to slow Amazon’s momentum, Bloomberg reported. Amazon has been tackling retail one category at a time, disrupting bookstores and electronics stores first and more recently pushing into apparel and groceries. Its rise has coincided with the decline of prominent retail chains such as Macy’s Inc. and Sears Holdings Corp., which have shuttered stores and laid off workers in response to declining sales. Shopping malls have resorted to hosting concerts and carnivals in empty parking lots to keep customers coming. Amazon’s rise has made its founding Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos the world’s second wealthiest person, behind only Microsoft Corp. co-founder Bill Gates, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. His ascendancy has won praise from fellow self-made billionaires Warren Buffett and Mark Cuban, owner of the Dallas Mavericks and judge on the television show "Shark Tank." “Amazon is worth far more than $1,000 a share,” said Cuban, an Amazon investor. “Consumers always want things at lower prices delivered faster. Amazon uses data better than anyone to achieve those goals for everything it sells. They have a chance to be the most dominant company in the world.” (Newsmax wire services, the Associated Press, Reuters and Bloomberg contributed to this report).

The milestone for the company, which dominates in online commerce and cloud computing, comes as its share price has climbed 40 percent from one year ago. Amazon shares hit $1,001.20 on Tuesday morning before falling below the threshold; its 52-week low was $682.12. Investors are pondering how high the stock can climb as the company concentrates on replicating its U.S. success in other markets, Bloomberg News reported. Amazon, headquartered in Seattle, has a $478 billion market value, double that of Walmart Stores Inc., although Walmart sales are expected to have three times Amazon's sales in 2017. Investors value Amazon's web traffic and delivery network over Walmart's retail presence in stores across the country because online spending is expected to grow four times faster than overall retail spending, Bloomberg said. Amazon improved on expectations in April when it posted revenue of $35.7 billion, starting the upward climb of the stock price. Sales increased 23 percent and business sales by amazon Web Services, its cloud computing division, increased 42 percent in the first quarter of 2017. With its market value, Amazon is larger company than the other 14 U.S. stocks currently trading above $1,000 per share, combined. The only other tech company on the list is Priceline Group.

Saved under World Tags: Amazon Web Services, Amazon.com, AWS, Jeff Bezos Tweet Jeff Bezos Amazon.com’s shares topped US$1 000 for the first time on Tuesday, marking a new milestone for a company wooing investors by dominating online commerce and cloud computing. Amazon shares hit $1 001,20 in New York, up about 40% from a year ago and more than double the 15% gain of the S&P 500 Index in the same period.

Another Amazon advantage is its profitable and fast-growing cloud-computing division Amazon Web Services, which maintains a global network of data centres and rents out storage space and computing functions to clients in a variety of industries, including Netflix and Airbnb as well as Capital One Financial and the US federal government. Yelp runs many of its functions on AWS. This year, companies around the world will funnel $246,8bn to Amazon and other cloud services providers, according to Gartner, up 18% from 2016.

Sign Up Another Amazon advantage is its profitable and fast-growing cloud-computing division Amazon Web Services, which maintains a global network of data centers and rents out storage space and computing functions to clients in a variety of industries, including Netflix Inc. and Airbnb Inc. as well as Capital One Financial Corp. and the federal government. Yelp runs many of its functions on AWS. This year, companies around the world will funnel $246.8 billion to Amazon and other cloud services providers, according to Gartner, up 18 percent from 2016. Amazon’s rise has made its founding Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos the world’s second wealthiest person, behind only Microsoft Corp. co-founder Bill Gates, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. His ascendancy has won praise from fellow self-made billionaires Warren Buffett and Mark Cuban, owner of the Dallas Mavericks and judge on the television show "Shark Tank." “Amazon is worth far more than $1,000 a share,” said Cuban, an Amazon investor. “Consumers always want things at lower prices delivered faster. Amazon uses data better than anyone to achieve those goals for everything it sells. They have a chance to be the most dominant company in the world.” For more on Amazon, check out the Decrypted podcast: Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Shares of Amazon surged above $1,000 for the first time Tuesday, marking another milestone in the rise of the American online retail giant. Near 14:10 GMT, the company's shares were selling at $997.97, up 0.2 percent after earlier getting as high as $1,001.20. Amazon's market capitalization stood at about $478 billion, more than twice that of Wal-Mart Stores. After going in public in May 1997 at $18 a share, Amazon has benefited from tectonic shifts in US technology and consumer shopping habits that are expected to continue to remake the retail industry. The company has evolved from its origins as an online bookseller into a broad-based retailer of apparel and household staples, from electronics to sausage casing. And with its "Prime" subscription service, it also has become a creative force in Hollywood and beyond. Amazon shares have appreciated especially rapidly over the last three years in anticipation that e-commerce will become a much bigger force in the retail sector. Online sales currently comprise about eight percent of the US retail market. Amazon alone accounts for about 43 percent of US online sales, according to consultancy Slice Intelligence. E-commerce is expected to grow between eight and 12 percent this year, according to the National Retail Federation, about three times as much as the rest of the industry, which has faced massive store and mall closures. Amazon, whose revenues grew to $35.7 billion in the first quarter, also has impressed Wall Street by laying out a plan to achieve greater profitability. It is in the process of investing $1.5 billion to establish its own delivery network and lessen its dependence on shipping giants FedEx and UPS. That will help contain delivery costs, which grew 30 percent to $1.9 billion in the first quarter. The surge above $1,000 a share also raises questions about whether Amazon intends to pursue a stock split. At Amazon's annual meeting a week ago, chief executive Jeff Bezos said the matter was under consideration. The company had three previous stock splits, in June 1998 and in January and August 1999. Amazon currently is the fourth biggest company by market capitalization after Apple, Google parent Alphabet and Microsoft.

A new report from Bentonville-based Harvest Revenue Group outlines several risks for suppliers now that Wal-Mart knows the price Jet paid suppliers for like products. Harvest Revenue President Boyd Evert, told Talk Business & Politics the suppliers facing the biggest audit risks could be those companies that have used distributors to unload remnant products at closeout prices. “Say a company has undergone a new packaging change at Wal-Mart’s asking and there are remnant products in the old packaging that the supplier uses a distributor to sell as close outs. If Jet purchased those items at closeout prices and that was better than the price Wal-Mart got, the third party auditors could see that as a violation of the supplier agreement and trigger an margin audit,” Evert said. He said anytime Jet got a better price for an item than Wal-Mart, an auditor will be likely to write a claim for the difference. Given the number of stores Wal-Mart has and the amount of volume it sells that could be a huge dent to suppliers’ accounts in the form of chargebacks. Just 50-cents difference in Jet’s favor for something like laundry detergent could be multiplied by thousands given the product volume Wal-Mart does each week. Wal-Mart’s 2015 policy changes that imposed a 1% surcharge on any merchandise moving through a distribution center, a 10% surcharge on all merchandise shipped to a new, expanded or newly remodeled store, and the 90-day payment option Wal-Mart has on invoices to still get a cash discount, are proof the retailer is being more adversarial when it comes to costs. The report estimates Tyson Foods, who does roughly $6.95 billion of business with Wal-Mart and Sam’s Club, is paying as much as $35 million in added costs to do business with Wal-Mart since the 2015 surcharges began. The report also states that Wal-Mart continues to push suppliers to help underwrite its most recent price perception efforts with lower up front prices. At the supplier summit held in Bentonville earlier this year suppliers were reportedly told Wal-Mart expects them to help it beat competitors in head-to-head pricing 80% of the time. Evert said the dynamic pricing strategy and Wal-Mart eagerness to be the low cost leader in retail has subjected more suppliers to margin audits since 2015. He said some suppliers have been told to pay the claims or risk losing shelf space. He also said it’s the retailer that has sole responsibility for setting the selling price of items. Jet’s smart cart pricing formula essentially can take the final sales price lower than Wal-Mart and thus trigger an audit, according to the report. Evert said it’s unlikely Wal-Mart’s internal auditors would choose to pursue a cross-channel claim. However, he said, third party auditors are more “aggressive and “creative” in filing claims based on assumptions. He said when these claims are filed it’s up to the supplier to disprove. “In the Wal-Mart environment, the company can automatically deduct the amount in question, up to $100,000, until the supplier is able to prove its case,” Evert said. He said there is no foolproof way for suppliers to Wal-Mart and Jet to inoculate their company from an audit by adopting a defensive game plan. He said retailers and third parties can initiate those as they so chose, but he outlined steps suppliers can take to be in a better positions to defend their bottom lines. Following are some of the tips recommended by Harvest Revenue. • Research your company’s relationship with Jet.com prior to the acquisition by Wal-Mart. If you (supplier) had a contract with Jet, expect the terms most favorable to Wal-Mart to applied to all of your transactions of related merchandise. • Understand the combined buying function implemented across the online and brick and mortar channel. Seek out specifics from your buyer about how your product line is affected and what to expect going forward. • Redefine or negotiate the terms and conditions of your supplier contract. Carve out exclusions affecting sales via an online channel. • Be very specific when writing sales orders. Make sure that any pricing or profit guarantees are narrowly worded to reduce the likelihood of a creative interpretation. • Define all the variables in writing. Suppliers’ relationships with their buyers have changed with decisions increasingly being pushed to the Shared Service function when it comes to payment and pricing disputes. • Align with organizations that allow you to benchmark with other suppliers. Given Wal-Mart’s size it is easy for them to lean on an individual supplier but, with shared knowledge, suppliers can resist a heavy hand. • Require transparency. Hold Wal-Mart to the same standards to which it holds your company, requiring complete supporting documentation to decide if a claim is valid or invalid. • Revisit Form 100. Many suppliers filled out this request for information without recognizing the implied commitments contained within it. (In Form 100 suppliers were instructed to provide not only the cost and available discount information, but also divulge its funding allocations for co-ops, trade spending, supply chain reliability and post audit claims – any of which could used to formulate claims or demands seeking additional revenue from the supplier.) • Establish consensus between your sales and finance teams. Observe and define the balance between protecting what’s rightfully yours and enhancing your business with an important customer. • Consider seeking out professional deduction management expertise. –––––––––––––––––––––– Editor’s note: The Supply Side section of Talk Business & Politics focuses on the companies, organizations, issues and individuals engaged in providing products and services to retailers.

But there are two other revenue sources that could substitute as well — capital gains and dividend taxes. The goal of tax reform should be to increase business investment, which the US needs more of. Economists often talk about capital gains taxes, dividend tax and corporate income tax as if they are essentially the same thing — taxes on capital. And for someone considering investing in stocks, they are indeed fairly similar. Suppose I have $1,000 that I’m contemplating investing in Wal-Mart stock. If I do, I’ll have a claim on Wal-Mart’s future earnings. Corporate income taxes take away some of those earnings and gives them to the government. If Wal-Mart tries to hand its earnings over to me by issuing a dividend, then dividend taxes take away some of that money. And if Wal-Mart tries to give me its earnings by buying back its stock and raising the share price, capital gains taxes confiscate some of that. (Stock buy-backs and dividends have a few differences, but both represent ways of returning money to shareholders.) So if I’m thinking ahead about my potential Wal-Mart stock purchase, these are just three ways that the government will take some of the value of my investment. Each of these taxes gives me an incentive to skip the stock purchase, and put my money in a bank account, or use it to consume more. If the taxes got too high, it could starve companies of the financial capital they need to expand and hire more workers, and the economy could suffer. What’s more, the taxes add to each other — corporate earnings are taxed once at the time they are earned, and a second time when they are handed out as capital gains from stock buy-backs or dividends. This is known as double taxation. For these reasons, some tax economists recommend reducing or even eliminating taxes on capital gains and dividends. But there’s a big, important difference between the types of capital taxes. Suppose that instead of a prospective Wal-Mart stock buyer, I’m someone who already owns the shares. Now, the taxes affect my calculus in different ways. If I use my voting power to encourage Wal-Mart to hand over its earnings in the form of dividends or buy-backs, I pay the dividend and capital gains tax immediately. But if I encourage Wal-Mart to re-invest its profits — building new stores, buying new equipment and hiring more workers — I pay the corporate tax when the income is earned, and the capital gains or dividend tax sometime in the future when the company decides to hand me back my money. In other words, for existing stockholders, the corporate income tax is an incentive to take money out of a business and spend it instead of reinvesting it, while capital gains and dividend taxes are a reason to delay taking money out. If the goal of tax policy is to make businesses invest more, then corporate taxes are definitely bad, but capital gains and dividend taxes are ambiguous. In the real world, dividend tax cuts haven’t done a very good job at prompting businesses to expand. In 2003 the US enacted a huge cut in dividend taxes, called the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003. The top dividend income tax rate went from 38.6 per cent to 15 per cent. Dividend issuance increased somewhat. But as a 2015 paper by economist Danny Yagan found, this gigantic tax cut did nothing to stimulate business investment. Another recent study in Sweden also found no effect. Contrast this with the evidence on corporate income taxes. A number of studies have found that cutting the corporate tax does boost business investment. This fits with intuition — corporate taxes clearly discourage business expansion, while the case for cutting capital gains and dividend taxes is unclear. This suggests that if the US wants to get businesses to expand more, instead of just disgorging their cash, it should consider shifting away from the corporate income tax to capital gains and dividend taxes. There might be another reason to raise the capital gains and dividend taxes: discouraging corporate short-termism. Many industry leaders worry that financial markets focus too much on annual stock performance, forcing public companies to spend too much energy on meeting quarter-to-quarter earnings forecasts. Capital gains taxes, by encouraging investors to keep their money in a company, could blunt short-termism and lead to more investment for the long term. This idea isn’t without risks. Locking in investments could discourage investors from moving their money from old, slow-growing companies to fast-growing young ones. But with corporate borrowing rates near 50-year lows, this doesn’t seem like that big of a danger right now. So the US should consider shifting the type of taxes it employs. Higher levies on capital gains and dividends, coupled with lower taxes on corporate earnings, could encourage the kind of future-oriented business expansion that the country needs.

Who’s Taking Responsibility for Your Supply Chain? May 29, 2017 Dave Blanchard EMAIL Tweet Comments 0 Manufacturers are being held to a higher standard of corporate social responsibility, and are developing new best practices to adapt their supply chain ecosystems accordingly. APP’s deforestation efforts begin at nurseries such as this one, where trees are grown from seedlings before being transplanted to the rainforest. APP Advertisement Economist Milton Friedman once said that “the social responsibility of business is to increase its profits,” but then again, Friedman spent his entire career in academia, not manufacturing. He never had to face down shareholders and customers demanding that his company establish sustainability goals and then regularly report on their progress toward reaching those goals. For manufacturers today, it definitely matters that companies include corporate social responsibility as part of their standard business practices. If a company appears to be lax on the CSR front, it can take a lot of time—and-money—to restore their reputation. Just ask Asia Pulp & Paper (APP), the third biggest paper manufacturer in the world. As a multi-national company whose products are agricultural-based, APP uses a lot of natural resources to create its paper-based products, including tissue and packaging materials. The paper production process involves the cutting down of a lot of trees, amounting to more than 20 million metric tons of pulp and paper per year. APP is headquartered in the island nation of Indonesia, which has the largest rainforest in Asia and the second largest in the world (after Brazil). There’s a fine line between the business of producing paper and reckless deforestation practices, and according to activist non-government organizations (NGOs) like Greenpeace and the World Wildlife Fund, APP crossed that line and then some, since the charges were leveled that the company was endangering both the flora as well as the fauna of the rainforest by stripping bare the habitats of tigers and orangutans, threatening the lifestyles of indigenous peoples living in the rainforest, and even contributing to climate change due to a large amount of greenhouse gas emissions. The seriousness of the charges against APP was sufficient to convince several major customers, such as Mattel, Office Depot, Staples and Walmart, to end their relationships with the paper company. That fall from grace, coupled with the loss of a lot of business, prompted APP to embrace CSR in a big way, which resulted in its Forest Conservation Policy. The central premise behind the FCP is APP’s intent to dramatically reverse the effects of deforestation by halting the harvesting of natural forest timber throughout its entire supply chain. Among other things, APP’s stated plan is to be completely reliant on plantation-sourced (as opposed to rainforest-sourced) pulpwood, and that carbon emissions will be reduced by 26% by 2020. To prove to the world that it meant what it said, APP also invited the Rainforest Alliance, a prominent NGO, to independently evaluate the company’s progress. Popular Now What Could be Done about China's Theft of Intellectual Property? How to Reduce Costs through Supply Chain Network Optimization How to Set Up a Lean Factory That Works, Part 1 Early reports are promising, though the Rainforest Alliance’s finding concludes that APP has gotten off to a good start but still needs to do a lot more. At a media event in Indonesia, Aida Greenbury, APP’s managing director of sustainability, acknowledged that more work does indeed need to be done, but as she told IndustryWeek, “We can’t do it alone. We’re addressing our legacy, but to achieve zero deforestation with our suppliers and other producers, we have to work together to find solutions.” Speaking by way of analogy, she explained, “We’ve started with the foundation, and have started building the house, but we’re not to the roof yet. We’ve got a good blueprint and a good foundation, but we’re still early in the process.” Merely promising to eliminate deforestation wasn’t going to win back any business for APP; the company had to actually demonstrate how that was going to happen. On the island of Sumatra, within APP’s R&D center, forests are actually being created, one tree at a time. APP’s scientists have created a new and hardier crop of acacia and eucalyptus trees (the types of trees the company harvests for paper), which can grow to their full height of 65 feet in about five years. These trees, developed as seedlings in a lab setting, offer visual proof that APP has figured out a way to replenish the natural resources it depends on, one seedling at a time. And APP’s public commitment to deforestation has won back several of the customers it had lost, including Staples and Walmart.   Will It Go Round in Circles? Buzzwords are as prevalent in sustainability discussions as any other area of manufacturing, and the term circular economy has emerged recently to describe companies’ efforts to reuse and recycle as much raw material as possible, with the idea of keeping products from ever ending up in a landfill. The circular economy aims to turn waste into wealth by keeping resources in productive use—in effect, becoming a kind of closed-loop supply chain. More than 90% of companies told consulting firm Accenture that they are implementing circular business models in their supply chains, particularly for material recovery and recycling. However, it turns out that many manufacturers are adopting circular economy strategies due to competitive pressure, and not with the intent of putting circularity at the front and center of their supply chain operations, notes Sudipta Ghosh and Harry Morrison, managing directors with Accenture. In a recent study of 500 companies with revenues over $1 billion, Accenture discovered that companies are more likely to be motivated by low-cost rivals or warranty issues, and not the social responsibility aspect. “Most efforts don’t decouple production from primary resource use,” Ghosh and Morrison note. “Not only is this leading to sizable losses in cost-savings and efficiencies, but it is also resulting in missed opportunities to unleash growth and profitability across the business.” It’s also just as likely that companies are going green because, well, they don’t have much choice, particularly if they’re consumer packaged goods (CPG) manufacturers who sell to big-box retail giant Walmart. In April 2017, Walmart launched Project Gigaton, which aims to reduce 1 billion tons of greenhouse gas emissions from its global supply chain by 2030. The retailer is expected to urge the new project on its suppliers by following the same basic supply chain modus operandi it used in years past when pushing for EDI, RFID and labeling standards: Do it if you want to continue doing business with us. As Laura Phillips, Walmart’s senior vice president of sustainability, told Bloomberg, most of the carbon reductions will come from key CPG suppliers, such as General Mills, Campbell Soup and Unilever. In launching Project Gigaton, Walmart collaborated with some key NGOs, such as the World Wildlife Fund and the Environmental Defense Fund, to develop an emissions reduction toolkit. As APP learned, having the NGO community supporting your efforts goes a long way in winning the all-important battle for good publicity.   Slaves to Their Jobs While environmental activists can often identify pollution by sight alone, as both water and air tend to take on unnatural hues when exposed to chemicals, it’s nowhere near as easy to spot the incidences of slavery and human trafficking in the workplace, despite the fact that slavery is a problem of global proportions, says consultant Robert Kuhn, chair of ISM’s Sustainability and Social Responsibility committee. Nearly 46 million people live subjected to some form of involuntary servitude, according to the Global Slavery Index, but rescuing those people will require the collective efforts of all manufacturers closely monitoring their own supply chains as well as the supply chains of their suppliers, both upstream (e.g., mining or agricultural workers) and downstream (e.g., apparel sweatshops). “Eradicating modern slavery is first and foremost a moral imperative, but it is also an issue of reputational risk and regulatory compliance,” Kuhn explains. In fact, the ISM’s guiding principles on human rights recommend, in part, that all supply chain professionals: • Communicate organizational human rights policies and expectations to suppliers and throughout the supply chain. • Be vigilant as to possible human rights violations in the supply chain. • Implement appropriate organizational policies and procedures upon learning of suspected abuse. Easier said than done, though. Although almost half of all slaves are in India, it’s a myth that modern slavery only occurs in Third World or emerging countries. For instance, more than 1.5 million people working in slavery-like conditions live in Europe, North America, Australia and Japan, points out Helen Carter, a consultant with Action Sustainability. Also, as the history of human misery has proven time and again, slavery is quite lucrative to the slaveholders. “Forced labor in the private economy generates $150 billion in illegal profits every year,” Carter notes. It’s also a myth, she adds, that sex trafficking represents the majority of all instances of modern slavery; in fact, sex trafficking makes up only about 20% of all cases. By far the majority occur in manufacturing, construction, agriculture, mining, textiles, utilities and domestic work. So how do you ensure that the raw materials your company sources or the piecework done to produce your final products weren’t the result of forced labor? For starters, it’s vital that a company spell out its specific policies toward slavery and forced labor standards, which should include a process for protecting whistleblowers and supporting victims of slavery practices, Carter says. It’s also important that the company’s leaders, extending to the very top of the corporate ladder, are in full support of your anti-slavery policies, and that all employees are trained on the company’s approach to thwarting labor exploitation. Then conduct a risk and opportunity assessment, she suggests, and determine the measures you’re going to use. She recommends that companies analyze their spend and map out their supply chain. You need to know where your biggest risk is for exploitation, and how to circumvent those risks. Ultimately, Kuhn admits, identifying and eliminating forced labor is a huge undertaking, as “bad actors have gotten quite good at hiding their subversive activities.” Nevertheless, through collaboration with supply chain partners and working with NGOs, substantial progress toward ending slavery can be made.   Plugging the Skills Gap While the incidence of forced labor can be undetectable, one labor practice that is most definitely front-and-center to manufacturing executives is the training and retention of skilled employees, particularly in an era that seems far more focused on furthering the advances of technology and automation than on the development of people to facilitate those advances. If a company’s first responsibility is to its own workforce, then it’s incumbent upon companies first and foremost to meet the needs of its employees. “U.S. manufacturing job openings are outpacing qualified candidates, resulting in a widening skills gap across the industry,” points out Philippe Cochet, chief productivity officer with global conglomerate General Electric. To plug that gap, GE has launched a program called Brilliant Learning that aims to train more than 150,000 global supply chain employees in the use of digital technologies and new manufacturing processes. “Brilliant Learning is our skills curriculum to train global supply chain employees for the new, highly valuable jobs that are needed in our evolving digital industrial workforce,” Cochet explains. “The initiative is based on GE’s Brilliant Factory strategy, which combines lean, advanced, additive and digital manufacturing to increase productivity.” While the program is initially being rolled out to the company’s supply chain employees, it will also be available to all employees, in multiple languages across all levels of manufacturing roles. “As a digital industrial company, we utilize digital technology across our businesses and work streams,” Cochet continues. “New technology is already augmenting the capabilities of our workers and elevating what it means to work in manufacturing. For example, we are leveraging Big Data to develop energy management insights through our Predix software platform, which is a huge productivity and resource efficiency opportunity. We are also paying close attention on how to best use these types of digital industrial applications in our sustainability program to lower energy costs and emissions.” On the environmental front, Cochet points out that sustainability isn’t considered an initiative at GE; rather, it is integrated into the company’s core business strategy. In energy management, for instance, GE has applied its own innovations in on-site solar and LED lighting at numerous facilities. Just as importantly, GE works very closely with its suppliers, with the emphasis on including them in sustainability efforts. “Our suppliers often come to us for best practice advice on how they can implement similar strategies,” Cochet observes. “We believe this is good business practice.”             Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Please Log In or Register to post comments.

Wal-Mart’s acquisition of Jet.com is accelerating its progress in e-commerce as it works to narrow the gap between itself and online leader Amazon. Signs point to progress. ASSOCIATED PRESS Lore ASSOCIATED PRESS Share Tweet Share Email Comments Print HOBOKEN, N.J. — Even after an online spending spree, it may be hard for Wal-Mart Stores to escape the Amazon in the room. Wal-Mart’s acquisition of Jet.com and brands that appeal to younger shoppers gave it an e-commerce boost as it works to close the gap between itself and the online leader. The world’s largest retailer is betting on essentials like fresh produce, and has adjusted its shipping strategy to better compete with Amazon’s Prime program. But Amazon keeps innovating too, implementing new technology and trying to make shopping more convenient. Marc Lore, a co-founder of Jet.com who is now head of Wal-Mart’s U.S. online operations, said he’s confident about the firm’s momentum, and it has a lot of room to thrive. “I can tell you we are happy with the moves we are making, and we are happy with the results,” Mr. Lore said at the Jet headquarters in Hoboken, N.J. He noted that e-commerce sales industrywide are still growing 15 percent per year. Mr. Lore has led Wal-Mart’s acquisitions of specialty online retailers like ModCloth, Moosejaw, and ShoeBuy.com, and said he’s still looking at firms with expertise in categories where Wal-Mart wants to grow faster. As Wal-Mart prepares to show off some innovations this week before its shareholder meeting, signs indicate that things are starting to click. Sales at Walmart.com rose 63 percent in the first quarter, up from 29 percent growth in the previous quarter and marking its fourth straight quarter of increases. Despite its acquisitions, Wal-Mart said a majority of the growth was through Walmart.com, fueled by changes in its shipping strategy and a discount for those who pick up their online orders. Walmart.com now offers 50 million products, including from third-party sellers, up from 10 million a year ago. Amazon has hundreds of millions of products. Amazon accounted for 33 percent of U.S. online sales last year, the research firm Euromonitor found. Wal-Mart is now in second ahead of eBay, with 7.8 percent. Greg Melich of research firm Evercore estimates that Amazon customers spend an average of $800 a year on the site, and members of its $99-a-year Prime program spend on average 2.7 times more than others.

The video has not been released pending the sheriff’s office investigation into the shooting of Donald Sneed III, 31, who died following a struggle with the deputy outside the front doors of the store at 10300 E. U.S. 350. The deputy was working off-duty security at the store and was trying to help store employees who had stopped Sneed for allegedly shoplifting when Sneed disarmed the deputy of her stun gun and shocked her in the neck with it, according to Sgt. John Payne, a spokesman for the sheriff’s office. The deputy shot Sneed to protect herself and others in the store, Payne said in a statement. Following the investigation, the case will be submitted to the Jackson County prosecutor’s office for a decision on whether charges should be filed. Sneed’s relatives have said they are eager for more information about the shooting, and about how the alleged theft turned into a deadly physical confrontation. The sheriff’s office has declined to say how many shots were fired, how many times Sneed was hit, what Sneed was accused of shoplifting or how long the deputy has been on the force. Sneed’s wife, Rachel Sneed, said she was shocked at Sneed’s death but also knew he had been in trouble recently. At the time of the shooting, Sneed was wanted for felony arrest warrants on charges of robbery and tampering with a motor vehicle. The couple had a 10-year-old daughter and had been separated for some time while Sneed struggled with substance abuse problems and spent time in Colorado and Florida. Sneed, a carpenter by trade, had also been a parent to Rachel Sneed’s three children from a previous relationship. “They are pretty shook up,” Rachel Sneed said of the children. “He was really good with kids,” she said. “He was actually a really good person once upon a time. He was very, very sweet. He loved to make people laugh. He would carry an older lady’s groceries to her car at the store. He just went down the wrong road.” Sneed had been an accomplished athlete and had earned a black belt in taekwondo, Rachel Sneed said. “He was trying to get his life back,” she said. “He was trying to put himself back together for his daughter, he really was.” According to the sheriff’s office, the incident at the Wal-Mart began shortly before 10 p.m. when the deputy recognized Sneed as being wanted on arrest warrants. She alerted store employees, who allegedly watched Sneed shoplift some merchandise. Two store employees contacted Sneed as he exited the store, and a struggle ensued. The deputy began to help the employees, and Sneed reportedly fought with the deputy. The deputy discharged her stun gun at Sneed, but to no effect. Then Sneed allegedly took the stun gun away from the deputy and used it on her. The deputy shot Sneed with her duty weapon. Emergency medical personnel arrived and rendered aid to both Sneed and the deputy. The deputy was treated at a hospital and released. The sheriff’s office has not described her injuries. The deputy will be on administrative leave while the shooting is under investigation by the sheriff’s office criminal investigations unit.

Last Memorial Day I became a little upset that Chipley did not display flags. I admired Wausau for their flags and stated that on my Facebook page. I was then challenged to do something about it and I took the challenge. By July 4th I had 100 flags, 75 sponsored in Honor of or in Memory of someone’s loved one. A blue ribbon, with the loved one’s name embroidered on it, was attached to each flag pole. Next was how to display them. One day it just came to me that we could use umbrella bases. After going to every Walmart and every Lowes, my family had 100 bases for the 100 flags. Now it came to what to put in the base to weight them down. For July 4th I used water but between leaks and the hot weather (evaporating) it just did not work as well as we wanted. Sand/dirt came next. The problem was that the bases had to have a flap cut into them so that the dirt could go in and this weakened the base. We used these for Veterans Day but the dirt clomped because moisture seeped into it. This made the flags tilt. After much thought, me and my husband came up with using mortar/cement with bases that are wider on the bottom and gradually become small to the top, pyramid shape. We labored to fill 62 bases and the results were great, no leakage, no clomping. This Memorial Day I had over 140 flags to display and the flags had to go out early because my husband was going to be out of town and it can not be done without him. Tuesday night I did not sleep, I had just seen on the news that we were going to have wind gust up to 25 miles and I was not sure the bases would hold. At 5am Wednesday we put the flags out and because there was little wind they looked great. As I finished and was heading home one of the flags fell over. I rushed to Walmart and bought 25 gallon jugs of water and added water to each of the bases to help weight them down. No luck. Between the wind gust and the tractor trailers rushing down 90, the bases could not hold the flags up. I don’t think I could have done anything to the bases to make them hold under the circumstances. I ended up meeting Chipley’s Chief of Police, who was nice enough to gather up the down flags and helped me load them into my van. I waited till that evening, when the winds died down, to set them back up. I am thankful to say the winds stayed under 10 MPH and the flags were fine. Yes, everyday a few flags had to be adjusted but not bad out of 142 flags. Now, I would do nothing to show disrespect to our flag and so I need to face two concerns. One concern was that the flags hang close to the ground.. Let me explain. I use 6 foot flag poles with 3ft by 5ft flags. The bases are 6 inches high and we use PVC pipe to fastened the pole into the base, which adds about an inch in height. Longer poles will make the flag too top heavy, which would make it easier to tip over. The flag does not touch the ground unless the pole becomes very tilted in the base. This can easily be fixed, just straighten it back up. Second concern is that the flags that get blown over and lay on the ground should be destroyed. I panicked on this one, Mother Nature has a mind of her own and the flags will tip over. I looked up flag etiquette and thankfully the flag can continue to be displayed and can even be washed. My family has put over 100 hours of love and labor into the flags and we are still learning. We will strengthen the bases once again before July 4 and will hopefully find an alternative by Veterans Day. We love Chipley, this country and the American flag and we humbly apologize to those that think we have been disrespectful in any way. The Veit Family Like this: Like Loading...

I get very emotional when I see all the flags displayed and am so thankful for all your time and effort! Thank you very much. Reply Dawn Veit says: May 30, 2017 at 1:32 pm Thank you Katherine. Your kind words are very much appreciated. Reply editor says: May 30, 2017 at 3:24 pm Dawn, Could you please provide some contact info for those wanting to sponsor a flag? Reply Dawn Veit says: May 30, 2017 at 5:14 pm To sponsor a flag just call or message me at 850-774-3564. You can sponsor a flag in Honor or in Memory of a love one, a family or a business. The cost is $75. I have 30 flags that need sponsors. Thank you! Reply Donna says: May 30, 2017 at 2:51 pm Thank you over and over again for the extreme effort in showing that Chipley, Florida is proud to be apart of the United States of America. Long has the respect been deteriorating across the country and we need to be careful to not lose the wonderful gift that so many lost their lives defending. Thank you and never apologize for your patriotic pride and love. Reply Dawn Veit says: May 30, 2017 at 5:22 pm Thank you Donna! If we all can work together we can once again bring back the respect for our beautiful flag and our wonderful country that has been, as you have said, deteriorating.

Tech Search Search BanksBank Customers Don’t Want Robo-Advisers Making Financial Decisions For Them BrazilBrazil Is Seeking to Join the OECD Despite Its Political Crisis IndiaIndia Is Still the World’s Fastest Growing Economy, Despite Last Year’s Shock Cash Crisis PointCloudWhy Steve Ballmer Loves Twitter A drone carrying a package Fabrice Coffrini—AFP via Getty Images Walmart Wal-Mart Explores Blockchain for Delivery Drones Robert Hackett May 30, 2017 Walmart has its eye on blockchain technology. The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) recently published a patent filed by the mega-retailer for a "delivery management system" that aims to improve upon last mile shipping—the final stretch extending to consumers' homes—by using robotics, sensors, and yes, blockchains, also often referred to as distributed ledgers. Blockchains are a kind of data structure that's dispersed across a network of computers in a way that proponents say is more secure than traditional means of record-keeping. Some companies, like the Danish shipping giant Maersk, are banking on the tech potentially reducing fraud and inaccuracies in their supply chains. The patent application, entitled "Unmanned aerial delivery to secure location," describes a process by which Wal-Mart (wmt) could automate the logistics of delivery drones. Coindesk, a Bitcoin and blockchain-tracking trade site, first spotted the filing on Tuesday. Although the patent application is vague on specifics, its authors lay out the general mechanics of a hypothetical delivery. Here's how it works: As a drone approaches a delivery box, it authenticates itself with a "blockchain identifier," a type of numeric or encrypted key. If the code is valid, then the box unlocks, opens, and accepts the package. When a package arrives at its destination, its receipt could trigger a notification to be sent to a consumers' mobile device. Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter. Wal-Mart can use a blockchain not only to authenticate identity, but to also track other useful information about a package as it moves through a supply chain, too. For instance, a blockchain-based database could log information such as time, location, handlers, delivery date, temperature, pickup protocols, and other data in a tamper-resistant format that's accessible to—and able to be trusted by—couriers, customers, and any other intermediaries along a package's route. Here's a diagram of the system. (You can read the details in the filing.) Wal-Mart has been exploring blockchain technology for some time. In October 2016, the company announced that it would partner with IBM (ibm) to digitally track shipments of pork in China using a blockchain. Wal-Mart filed a patent application for this delivery management system a year prior to the IBM announcement on November 25, 2015. (Wal-Mart did not immediately respond to Fortune's request for more information about the filing.) Wal-Mart's initiative represents just one potential application of the still nascent technology. Blockchains continue to be hyped for their potential to disrupt many areas of business, including financial services, supply chains, media, and governance.

NBC By Kate Beckman May 30, 2017 From customers dressed in bizarre costumes to incidents involving bodily functions, Walmart workers — like their counterparts at Target — have to deal with some pretty WTF moments. Here, employees shared some of their craziest stories on condition of anonymity. 1. There was a man using the hose we use to water our plants showering naked in the parking lot. He had put up a sheet to block one side, but people could still see everything. When the manager told him to leave, he acted like there was nothing weird about it. He was extremely nonchalant, like he did this all the time, and he just packed up his sheet, got in his car and left. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below 2. A lady came in with coupons that she clearly photocopied, and tried to use them to get majorly reduced prices on products like laundry detergent or paper towels. She got away with it because we had a new cashier, and with all of the coupons she used and the amount of money she saved on each item, the store ended up owing her money on what would have been a $600 purchase. 3. A customer was buying some iced tea and it rang up for $4.68. She started arguing with me, saying that it was $3.33. I went back to where the tea was to check the signs, and it clearly said $4.68. I came back to tell her it rang up at the correct price, and she goes to see for herself. Then she accused us of changing the prices while she was in line and started yelling about how we’re liars and stupid, and she’s going to call Walmart customer service to complain. The funny thing is, the price tags have the dates they were printed on them so she [should] have seen we were telling the truth. 4. There was a group of two guys and three girls. They were in the kid’s section, and the girls were throwing these big bouncy balls over the shelves to the other side trying to hit the boys, who were riding bikes down the aisle. Then they grabbed skateboards and were riding them around the store throwing random things into customers’ carts. They wouldn’t stop, so we had to call the cops to escort them out. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below 5. The maintenance guy was cleaning the bathroom near the back of the store, and a woman asked him to stop mopping so she could use the bathroom. He told her he couldn’t let her in because the floor was wet, but she could use the bathroom near the front of the store. She went to the infant’s clothing department and peed and pooped on the floor. She also managed to hide her face from the camera the entire time, so we couldn’t even identify her to press charges. 6. I was working register around 11:30 at night. I gave a lady her change and she threw it on the floor. I ask her why she threw it on the floor, and she told me she wanted any children in the store to pick it up. I told her that there are no children around because it’s so late, and that maintenance would clean it up anyways. She told me to leave it on the ground. 7. A woman came to guest services saying she wanted to return a basket because it was haunted. I asked her what she meant, and she said her boyfriend took a picture of it and there was electrical frequency surrounding it and she couldn’t keep it in her house. She had the receipt so she was able to return it, but I still don’t understand how a basket could be haunted. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below 8. I was working at the service desk and a woman rushes up and says she needs to talk to my manager. I sometimes can fix the problem, so I asked her what she needed help with. Then she started yelling at me at the top of her lungs saying that the bathroom was closed and she peed on herself because it was closed. I explained that there was another bathroom in a different part of the store that was open. In the middle of me explaining that, she runs out of the store before I could get my manager, and I never saw her again. 9. There’s a guy who comes into the store regularly and always has a beer can suctioned to his forehead. We found out it’s some kind of advertising for a company, but it’s still pretty weird to see him walking around the store like that. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below 10. A man came into the store wearing a clown outfit and gory clown makeup. It was around Halloween so he probably worked at a haunted house, but it was pretty scary. He was just walking around, shopping for his dinner. 11. When I first started as a cashier, I was always at the register near one of the bathrooms. People would always come to me and tell me that maintenance needed to go to the bathroom, because someone wrote on the wall in poop. It weirdly was a semi-regular occurrence. I’m not sure if it was one person coming back or multiple people, but it stopped after a few months. 12. I was working the checkout line, and I’m not sure if one woman cut another one in line or bumped her with her cart, but these two women start arguing. Both of them had their pre-teen children with them. It ended with one woman telling the other that she hoped she got in a car accident on her way home. 13. A guy came into the store in a full gorilla suit. He was just doing his shopping like normal. At some point, we asked him to take the mask off for security reasons. He did, and just continued his shopping. 14. I saw a grown man walking around the store one night wearing one-piece purple pajamas with cartoon characters on it. He was probably in his late 30s or early 40s. A group of teenagers was laughing at him as he walked around, but he seemed pretty unfazed. 15. Not many customers realize that Walmart does price matching. One customer totally went to the extreme and designed his own ads with extremely discounted prices on name brands. I would have totally bought it, but the prices were ridiculous. For example, Tide laundry detergent usually goes between $9-$12 and this person had it down to $3. I played it off like everything was cool and called my manager. Next thing you know, this person is calling me every name in the book, threatening to sue me, and he literally called the police on me. Once the police arrived, my manager and I explained the situation to them and ended up having the customer sign a 'No trespassing on premises' form to avoid any more scenes with him. He ended up getting escorted out of the building by the cops. Funny thing is, I saw him at another store doing the same exact thing but with coupons. Follow Kate on Twitter.

Witnesses spotted the black bear outside the Somerset store at around 1:30 a.m., and called police and Kentucky Fish and Wildlife officials to help remove it. "We seen it running down the sidewalk in front of the outdoor living center outside of Walmart, and me and six other cars tried to keep the bear from going towards the customer entrance," customer Malcolm Stephens told LEX 18. Avid hunters Tyler and Travis Smith captured footage of the bear while maintaining a safe distance, but said a large crowd eventually formed around the animal. "They realized what was going on, everyone walked over here and saw that there was a bear and it drew a huge crowd of people. I bet there [were]...70 or 80 people standing around with their phones out, cameras, pictures, videos, and the bear showed no fear whatsoever and laid there like a dog would," Tyler Smith said. Officials used their sirens to scare the bear into a safe area. They believe the animal eventually made its way back into the woods.

Amazon stock hit 1,001.20 shortly after Tuesday’s opening bell, up about 40% from a year ago and more than 2X the 15% gainer of the S&P 500 Index in the same frame. Investors are thinking about how much further Amazon can grow as it tries to replicate its US success abroad. The 1,000 share price also puts Amazon’s market value at about $478-B, 2X that of rival Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) and more than 15X the size of Target (NYSE:TGT). The shares will likely push even higher since Amazon is growing so quickly in massive global industries that show no signs of slowing, as shopping habits change and businesses rethink how they deploy technology, said an analyst at Cowen, who recently upped his Amazon price target to 1,125 a share. Amazon has come a long way since its start in Y 1995, when it mostly sold books. The Seattle company now sells just about anything, from groceries to small appliances, and has been blamed for taking business away from department stores, supermarkets and clothing retailers. Amazon’s ventures far beyond online retail, from cloud computing to movie making, are raising questions among corporate strategy experts about its focus. The company wowed Wall Street recently with a 23% jump in sales, pushing its shares to an all-time high. But there are concerns that if blockbuster growth stops, investors may come to regard the company more like a conglomerate stock, usually worth less than the sum of its pieces. Investors also put more value in Amazon’s web traffic and delivery network than they do in Wal-Mart’s vast store presence because online spending will grow more than 4X faster than overall retail spending this year as shoppers continue to shift from stores to websites. The world’s largest online retailer is dominating e-Commerce with its $99-a-year Amazon Prime subscription, which includes delivery discounts, music and video streaming and photo storage that keep shoppers engaged with the website. Amazon had 80-M Prime subscribers in the US as of 31 March, an increase of 38% from a year earlier, according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. Prime memberships help lock in loyalty, which is critical as competitors such as Wal-Mart enhance their e-Commerce offerings to slow Amazon’s momentum. Amazon has been tackling retail one category at a time, disrupting bookstores and electronics stores first and more recently pushing into apparel and groceries. Its rise has coincided with the decline of prominent retail chains such as Macy’s Inc. (NYSE:M) and Sears Holdings Corp., which have shuttered stores and laid off workers in response to declining sales. Amazon’s rise has made its founding CEO Jeff Bezos the world’s 2nd wealthiest person, behind only Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) co-Founder Bill Gates, according to the Billionaires Index. “Consumers always want things at lower prices delivered faster. Amazon uses data better than anyone to achieve those goals for everything it sells. They have a chance to be the most dominant company in the world,” said on shareholder.

Shoppers at a Wal-Mart in Riverdale, Utah, noticed that something was wrong with a car that was parked on the lot, and a few of them came closer to investigate the matter. It did not take long to realize that two kids were apparently locked in the trunk. If leaving pets or children in the backseat of an automobile during extreme temperatures is dangerous, placing any living being in the trunk is insane. The action would not even be fun as a prank between friends, as someone could suffer from a panic attack or just die because of heat stroke or freeze to death if locked in the luggage compartment. We did not even mention getting asphyxiated, which is also a possibility in extreme conditions. According to Deseret News, the woman went shopping at the store nearby and faced the officers waiting by the unspecified car after her daughter was instructed to pull the safety latch of the trunk. The police were called by a witness who remained nameless, and he or she claimed seeing the 39-year-old locking two kids in the trunk. It is unclear if the statement reflects reality, or if the children, aged two and five, managed to enter the luggage compartment after being left on the back seats. Most hatchbacks, sedans, and wagons have a mechanism that makes it easy to fold the backrests of the rear seats to access the trunk, and it would not be impossible for a curious five-year-old to open the said compartment. However, if there is a credible witness that claims that the mother did put her kids in the trunk, things are entirely different from a legal and moral standpoint. Even if her kids managed to enter the trunk themselves, the woman is still at blame, because it is not wise to lock living beings in a vehicle. heatstroke hot cars negligence USA Utah   An Ode to Embracing the Metric System DIY: How to Setup An Email Address In a BMW - An Easy Guide Five Heaviest Convertible Sports Cars Available In Europe in 2017 The End of Sedans is Nigh!

Amazon shares hit $1,001.20 in New York on May 30, up about 40% from a year ago and more than double the 15% gain of the S&P 500 Index in the same period. Investors are thinking about how much further Amazon can grow as it tries to replicate its U.S. success abroad. The shares will likely push even higher since Amazon is growing so quickly in massive global industries that show no signs of slowing, as shopping habits change and businesses rethink how they deploy technology, said John Blackledge, an analyst at Cowen and Co., who recently upped his Amazon price target to $1,125 a share. "There’s a long runway there," he said. "The markets Amazon is playing in with global retail and cloud computing are just massive. Things continue to go well and investors are looking for more upside." RELATED: Amazon's delivery-drone research focuses on avoiding birds The Seattle company’s $478 billion market value is double that of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. even though the world’s biggest retailer will have sales three times larger than Amazon’s this year. Investors put more value in Amazon’s web traffic and delivery network than they do in Wal-Mart’s vast store presence because online spending will grow more than four times faster than overall retail spending this year as shoppers continue to shift from stores to websites, according to eMarketer Inc. The world’s largest online retailer is dominating e-commerce with its $99-a-year Amazon Prime subscription, which includes delivery discounts, music and video streaming and photo storage that keep shoppers engaged with the website. RELATED: Amazon’s warehouse robot war is spreading Seattle-based Amazon had 80 million Prime subscribers in the United States as of March 31, an increase of 38% from a year earlier, according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. Prime memberships help lock in loyalty, which is critical as competitors such as Wal-Mart enhance their e-commerce offerings to slow Amazon’s momentum. Amazon has been tackling retail one category at a time, disrupting bookstores and electronics stores first and more recently pushing into apparel and groceries. Its rise has coincided with the decline of prominent retail chains such as Macy’s Inc. and Sears Holdings Corp., which have shuttered stores and laid off workers in response to declining sales. Shopping malls have resorted to hosting concerts and carnivals in empty parking lots to keep customers coming. RELATED: Analysis - will Amazon revolutionize shipping? Another Amazon advantage is its profitable and fast-growing cloud-computing division Amazon Web Services, which maintains a global network of data centers and rents out storage space and computing functions to clients in a variety of industries, including Netflix Inc. and Airbnb Inc. as well as Capital One Financial Corp. and the federal government. Yelp runs many of its functions on AWS. This year, companies around the world will funnel $246.8 billion into Amazon and other cloud services providers, according to Gartner, up 18% from 2016. Amazon’s rise has made its founding CEO Jeff Bezos the world’s second wealthiest person, behind only Microsoft Corp. co-founder Bill Gates, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. His ascendancy has won praise from fellow self-made billionaires Warren Buffett and Mark Cuban, owner of the Dallas Mavericks basketball team and judge on the television show "Shark Tank." “Amazon is worth far more than $1,000 a share,” said Cuban, an Amazon investor. “Consumers always want things at lower prices delivered faster. Amazon uses data better than anyone to achieve those goals for everything it sells. They have a chance to be the most dominant company in the world.” By Spencer Soper Bloomberg News Follow Transport Topics on RSS Twitter Facebook © 2017, Transport Topics, American Trucking Associations Inc.

Rachel Jacoby ZoldanMay 30, 2017 10:05AM EDT Facebook Twitter Pinterest Facebook Twitter Pinterest When it comes to the best drugstore foundations, Maybelline FIT Me foundation is both a winner in terms of its actual product payoff (not to mention staying power), but also for its wallet-friendly price tag of $5.94 per bottle. Now, Maybelline has expanded its shade range, adding 16 new hues to the line, all available online at any of the brand's retailers or in-store exclusively at Wal-Mart. While the news of the new shades of Maybelline Fit Me Foundation literally just dropped yesterday on Twitter and on Instagram, it looks like Wal-Mart's already sold out of many of the new colors online, particularly the shades for darker complexions. (Twitter users have also called out the shades not being available on Amazon yet, either.) But Maybelline promised that even if they've sold out of some of the range online at various e-tailers, they'll be hitting Wal-Mart stores in June (aka, later this week). Which led to a huge sigh of relief on the social network — after all, Fit Me is one of the all-time foundation greats for oily skin. Not only is it free of any oils itself, but it has that ~blurring~ effect that makes your skin look all velvety and smooth, even when you're sweaty. https://twitter.com/Maybelline/status/869218247677165568 What's more, Maybelline Fit Me was already known for its wide shade range, with a slew of different undertones offered — so its highly likely that the brand may have just won legions of new foundation fans. Take a look at a few of the best Twitter responses to Maybelline's swatch update below, then head over to walmart.com to see if your shade is in stock. https://twitter.com/antoniobtwo/status/869219984156889089 https://twitter.com/bedofroses2001/status/869221143349252096 https://twitter.com/Maybelline/status/869287595993202689 Related: These Are the Best Foundations for Oily Skin You might also like: follow us Facebook Twitter Pinterest Recommended for You Follow:FacebookTwitterInstagramPinterestWe Heart ItTumblrYouTubeGoogle Plustoggle social menu Condé Nast Condé Nast Websites Allure Ars Technica Backchannel Bon Appétit Brides Condé Nast Traveler Epicurious Glamour Golf Digest Golf World GQ GQ Style Pitchfork Self Style Teen Vogue The New Yorker The Scene Vanity Fair Vogue W Wired Site MapContact usNewsletter SignupSubscriptionsIn this issue CareersCondé Nast StoreReprints/PermissionsParsons x TeenVogue Accessibility Help Registration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy (Revised 1/2/2014).  Teen Vogue may earn a portion of sales from products that are purchased through our site as part of our Affiliate Partnerships with retailers.  Your California Privacy Rights.

The NRDC’s new report, entitled “Crying Fowl: Major Grocers Stumble in Promoting Antibiotic Stewardship in Retail Chicken,” was released yesterday and investigates if and how Costco, Albertson’s/Safeway, Publix, Walmart, and Kroger market and sell antibiotic-free chicken brands.   These five chains represent more than 50 percent of the market share in North America. Overall scores attributed to each of the retailers in the report were as follows: Costco (40%), Albertson’s/Safeway (39%), Publix (38%), Walmart (38%), and Kroger (33%). “The grades reflect the fact that none of the top five retailers have made a strong public commitment to addressing antibiotic overuse in the supply chains for chicken sold in their stores,” notes a news release for the Natural Resources Defense Council. “The top five grocery store chains in the country feed millions of Americans, so their actions have a big impact on public health — for better or worse,” said Carmen Cordova, staff scientist with the NRDC. “Supermarkets can either continue to ignore the spread of drug-resistant infections, or they can answer their customers’ call to be a part of the solution.” While this is certainly a hurdle to overcome, many retailers and restaurants in the United States have committed to addressing antibiotic overuse in livestock, particularly in recent months. Whole Foods, for example, has a storewide policy for antibiotic-free meat, and several fast food restaurants including KFC, McDonald’s, Burger King, Jack in the Box, and Subway have committed to move toward antibiotic-free chicken over the next few months or years. “In the absence of action at the federal level, consumers have been driving the move toward meat raised with responsible antibiotics use,” said Cordova. “The fast food industry has been leading the way—but people want to be able to eat better meat at home too. Our report shows that grocery stores have a lot of catching up to do.” More than 70 percent of medically important antibiotics sold in the United States are destined for livestock use. In an overwhelming majority of these cases, antibiotics are distributed in regular low doses to promote fast growth of animals and prevent, rather than cure, diseases brought about by unsanitary living conditions. This practice promotes the development of dangerous antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which can be extremely harmful to both humans and animals.

By Nicole Aschoff / The Guardian May 29, 2017 Print Comments Photo Credit: Wikimedia It’s hard to think of a better poster child for “conscious capitalism” than Whole Foods Market, the high-end grocery store that made a name for itself selling organic produce in feel-good, mood-lit stores. These days, the chain is floundering and a potential buyout is on the horizon. What does that say about the conscious capitalism it championed?  Same-store sales have declined for six straight quarters, and Barclay analyst Karen Short estimates that 14 million Whole Foods customers walked away during the same period. Last month activist hedge fund Jana Partners swooped in, buying up 8.3% of the company’s shares and demanding an overhaul. Whole Foods responded by reshuffling its board, bringing in a handful of big box retail stars and promoting Gabrielle Sulzberger, who hails from private equity, to chairwoman. A failing firm isn’t exactly news. In the dog-eat-dog world of global capitalism lots of companies have their moment in the sun only to crash and burn a few years later. But Whole Foods was supposed to be different.  John Mackey, the company’s chief executive, has long argued that Whole Foods is wired differently — that it runs on a “conscious capitalism” model that outsmarts the competitive pressures of our for-profit system through creativity and innovation.  In his book, Liberating the Heroic Spirit of Business: Conscious Capitalism, Mackey argues that his conscious capitalism model achieves success by honoring not just shareholders, but all stakeholders, including workers, communities, and the environment. The Whole Foods founder penned his treatise in response to the growing consensus that capitalism is doing irreparable harm to the planet and the people who live on it. Our for-profit system is increasingly viewed as a zero sum game in which ecological destruction, climate change, and rising inequality are firmly linked to the rapacious behavior of multi-national corporations. Mackey agrees that humans are harming the planet, but he doesn’t think the problem lies in capitalism. Free market capitalism, according to Mackey, is actually a “beautiful,” “heroic,” system that, properly harnessed, can operate “in harmony with the fundamentals of human nature” and the planet.  We don’t need to rein in corporations through onerous labor and environmental regulations, he writes, because the virtuous feedback loop of honoring stakeholders plus innovation will leave “unconscious” firms like Walmart in the dust. The conscious capitalism model is appealing. It’s simple, easy. We can avert looming environmental catastrophe by becoming conscious consumers who frequent conscious companies. After all, shopping at Whole Foods is a heck of a lot more fun than lobbying for regulations on corporations or convincing people to consume less. More Whole Foods, less Walmart. Problem solved. Mackey was right about one thing. People do love to shop at Whole Foods, or at least they used to. These days that demon called competition has caught up with the Austin-based company. Behemoths like Kroger, Safeway, Target, and even Walmart now offer a wide-range of organic produce for considerably less than “Whole Paycheck.” Mackey’s conscious company has gone from Wall Street darling to Wall Street basket case in the blink of an eye. The future of conscious capitalism appears equally bleak. To placate shareholders and mitigate declining same-store sales, last year the company jettisoned its unique purchasing model that wove together a network of autonomous regional production hubs of small farmers and mom-and-pop food startups.  It’s now prioritizing a centralized, bulk-buying strategy that looks a lot like, well, Walmart. It also initiated a $1.25bn share buyback program and has promised to cut costs by $300 million and raise same-store sales 2% by 2020. But according to its 13D filing, Jana Partners — whose founder and fund manager Barry Rosenstein recently bought the most expensive home in America — wants even more. Like Whole Foods, Jana is experiencing a slump, suffering negative returns in 12 of the last 19 months; it’s expecting to cash in on its investment in the organics chain. A potential forced sale, most likely to private equity investors known for slash and burn tactics, remains on the near-term horizon. The point of this dour appraisal is not to crow over Whole Foods’ misfortune. It’s to take a hard look at models that claim to solve the ills of capitalism without challenging the in-built drives of our for-profit system.  Mackey has loudly declared unions akin to herpes and state regulation little more than “crony capitalism” — that all we need to solve things like the climate crisis are better, smarter, “conscious” capitalists. The crisis of Whole Foods belies this notion. There’s no way to “fix” corporations’ compulsion to produce ever more, ever more cheaply. It’s written into the DNA of global capitalism. Attractive as the conscious capitalism model may be, we simply can’t rely on companies to deliver dignified workplaces, equitable models of food production or a better relationship between consumers and the planet.  All stakeholders are not equal in our global economy, and even the best-intentioned businesses run up against the implacable foes of profit and competition. Ultimately, the thorny problem of sustaining both decent livelihoods and a livable planet won’t be solved by buying better things. It’ll be solved through political struggle and demands that put people before profit.         Share on Facebook Share         Share on Twitter Tweet Report typos and corrections to [email protected] '.         Comments Sign Up!

The first-quarter earnings reporting season is all but over, and the president was abroad for his first international trip as sitting head of state. Still, Benzinga has featured a look at many investor favorite stocks in recent days. Here is a look at just a few of them, as Americans travel, gather and remember those who made the ultimate sacrifice. Somewhere To Go "Analysts Cautiously Optimistic On Ford CEO Shakeup" by Shanthi Rexaline takes a look at the surprising management changes at Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) announced last week. Is it a step in the right direction, and how effective will the new chief executive be? Are there spin-offs in the offing? In "Tesla's Safety Record Called Into Question, And The Market Couldn't Care Less," Shanthi Rexaline examines the effect that a recent report about safety issues at its flagship plant in California has had on Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) shares. The stock has pulled back from an all-time high earlier this month. Something To Eat Ezra Schwarzbaum's "Wal-Mart Puts Pressure On Grocers, But Kroger Could Resist" discusses why even though recent gains at Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE: WMT) may mean there is less for its supermarket competitors, Kroger Co (NYSE: KR) may be better positioned than other peers to suffer. Also check out "Nobody Told Costco About The Retail Slump." Years of interaction with Shake Shack Inc (NYSE: SHAK) have convinced one key analyst that it is a company that is "standing for something good," according to "Analyst Says Long-Term Investors In Shake Shack Should Continue Buying Shares" by Merrick Weingarten. Will profits really increase "at a double-digit pace"? Something To Watch In Elizabeth Balboa's "Which Media Firms Are Benefiting Most From President Trump?" see who the winners and losers are in the often combative relationship between the media and the current administration: from CBS Corporation (NYSE: CBS) to New York Times Co (NYSE: NYT) and from Fox News to Saturday Night Live. "Notable Netflix Analyst Says Stock Could See Another 67% Gain" by Jayson Derrick examines the question of whether Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX) stock has peeked after a 75 percent gain in the past year. See why one analyst believes that the shares still have plenty of room to run.

The suspect was identified as Donald Sneed, 31 years old, of the Kansas City area. Sneed had active felony warrants for robbery and tampering with a motor vehicle. Sgt. John Payne says the shooting happened about 9:30 p.m., Sunday. He says the off-duty deputy was working security at the Wal-Mart at 10300 E. Missouri 350 when she recognized a wanted man. She notified the store's loss prevention department, which then watched as the suspect shoplifted some merchandise. Two store employees contacted the man as he left the store, and a struggle began. Payne says that when the deputy began helping with apprehending the man, he started fighting with her. She stunned him with her Taser, but it apparently had no effect on him as he continued resisting. The deputy then applied the stun gun directly to his body but it still had no effect. As they struggled, the suspect got control of the Taser and stunned the deputy in the neck. At that point, she shot the suspect, fearing for her life and others' lives, Payne says. Payne says the suspect was taken to a hospital, where he later died. The deputy was treated for injuries and released.

Cummins, 50, has been charged with knowingly transporting a minor across state lines with the intent to engage in sexual activity and one charge of obstruction of justice. He faces from 10 years to a lifetime sentence in prison.    Cummins was arrested on April 21, five weeks after going on the run from Columbus, Tennessee, with 15-year-old Elizabeth Thomas, a student he had been grooming for years.  The pair sparked a nationwide manhunt and dyed their hair to evade capture.  Thirty-eight days after their disappearance, they were found hiding out in a rural cabin near Cecilville in northern California where a groundskeeper tipped off police. Cummins remains in custody in Tennessee. Since his arrest, investigators have revealed their belief that he bought a $1,500 kayak and planned to paddle his way from San Diego to Mexico with Elizabeth in tow. Cummins and Elizabeth were seen on surveillance footage in a Walmart days after they vanished. The 15-year-old girl had already dyed her hair from blonde to brunette  Cummins was seen buying hair dye in a different store the day before they vanished  The pair were found in a remote cabin, living off the grid in Cecilville, California - above, investigators sift through evidence Tad Cummins was holed up with student Elizabeth Thomas in this cabin above for five weeks Cummins vanished with the girl on March 13 from Columbus Tennessee. He had just been suspended from the school where he taught her after other students reported seeing them kiss in his classroom.  Local police had begun investigating the allegations when they disappeared.  It has since been revealed that Cummins, a father, grandfather and self-described 'Jesus freak', left a note to his wife before fleeing.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Tennessee teacher, 50, bought a $1,500 kayak so he could...

Share this article Share In it, he apologized and told her not to call police because it would imply he was guilty of the allegations police were investigating. He made no mention of Elizabeth, who he and his wife had taken to church, and said he was merely going away to clear his head.   But prosecutors say he went to great lengths to keep them off-scent. They say he disabled the GPS of his car, threw both of their cell phones in a river and adopted aliases while on the run.  The pair were eventually found in a cabin in northern California after 39 days on the run  Cummins left his wife Jill a note to say he was leaving to clear his head before he vanished with the girl  Within days of going off-grid, the pair were filmed on surveillance footage entering a Tennessee Walmart.  Cummins remains in custody and is awaiting his next court date  Elizabeth had already dyed her hair, allegedly with the product Cummins was seen buying in a different store days earlier. In the weeks leading up to their disappearance, the teenager changed her Instagram bio to add the title 'wife' and she included a ring emoji.  When the pair were found in April, Elizabeth was taken to a rehab facility to be looked after.  She is refusing to go back to her family and insists she is in love with Cummins with whom she says she went willingly. His lawyers have argued that at no time did Elizabeth say she was taken against her will.    Cummins remains in a Kentucky jail after being deemed a flight risk, reported CBS 12.  'Cummins held a position of trust and authority as a teacher. He has already demonstrated his lack of regard for that position. He has also demonstrated his willingness to evade authorities,' the judge wrote in her decision for Cummins to be held without bond, according to USA Today. He is set to be arraigned on Thursday. A trial date has not been set.   Read more: cbs12.com/news/n...

Its stock surpassed the $1,000 mark for the first time. That price put Amazon's market value at about $478 billion, double that of the world's biggest traditional retailer, Wal-Mart, and more than 15 times the size of Target. A $1,000 investment on Amazon's first day of trading in 1997 would be worth more than $500,000 today. Not only has Amazon changed the retail landscape since it became a public company 20 years ago, it's now part of a small cadre of high-flying stocks belonging to companies that have defied Wall Street and shunned stock splits. Those splits make the stock more affordable and generate brokerage fees. But companies like Amazon have chosen to reward its long-term investors. The last time Amazon has split its stock was nearly 18 years ago, according to financial research firm FactSet. Another company with a similar philosophy is Alphabet Inc., the parent company of Google. Amazon just beat Alphabet to the $1,000 level, with its Class A shares just $2 short of $1,000 Tuesday. Only four other U.S.-listed companies have shares trading above $1,000: online travel booking company Priceline Group Inc., homebuilder NVR Inc., pork producer and ocean transportation company Seaboard Corp. and the apostle of long-term investing, Warren Buffett, with his holding company Berkshire Hathaway Inc. But stock prices only tell a part of the story. The value of a company is determined by its stock price and the number of shares on the market. Amazon.com is well over four times the size of Priceline, NVR and Seaboard combined. It's 17 percent bigger than Berkshire Hathaway, a multinational conglomerate with ownership stakes in some of America's most well-known consumer brands like Coca-Cola, insurance companies and U.S. infrastructure. Since launching a website to sell mostly books in 1995, Amazon has transfigured retail, sent revenue numbers to stratospheric heights, and is among the biggest reasons longtime powerhouses like Macy's, Borders bookstores and even RadioShack have suffered. Those companies are closing locations and Amazon is filling the void, sometimes literally. Last week in a location once occupied by Borders, the bookstore chain that went out of business in 2011, Amazon opened its first bookstore in New York City. _____ Contact Joseph Pisani at http://twitter.com/josephpisani Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

(WLFI) — A Lafayette woman is accused of abandoning a 2-year-old at Wal-Mart. The incident happened Friday night at the store on Commerce Drive in Lafayette. Prosecutors said the loss prevention officer approached two women about shoplifting. The women took off but left behind a child in a stroller. Police said officers discovered a bag of spice inside a pocket on the stroller. They were also able to locate a receipt with the name of the child’s father on it. Julie Wright, 35, was later identified as one of the women. Authorities said she was babysitting the child at the time. Charges against Wright are on a 72-hour hold. Prosecutors have until Friday afternoon to charge Wright or she will be released from the Tippecanoe County Jail, where she’s currently being held.

Amazon opened the retail store Thursday. Amazon, the e-commerce giant that changed how people shop for books, toilet paper and TVs, hit a new milestone Tuesday, May 30: Its stock topped $1,000 for the first time. (AP Photo/Mary Altaffer) Mary Altaffer Share Tweet Share Email Comments NEW YORK — Amazon, the internet goliath that revolutionized the way much of the world buys books, toilet paper and TVs, hit a new milestone Tuesday. Its stock surpassed the $1,000 mark for the first time. That price put Amazon’s market value at about $478 billion, double that of the world’s biggest traditional retailer, Wal-Mart, and more than 15 times the size of Target. A $1,000 investment on Amazon’s first day of trading in 1997 would be worth more than $500,000 today. Not only has Amazon changed the retail landscape since it became a public company 20 years ago, it’s now part of a small cadre of high-flying stocks belonging to companies that have defied Wall Street and shunned stock splits. Those splits make the stock more affordable and generate brokerage fees. But companies like Amazon have chosen to reward its long-term investors. The last time Amazon has split its stock was nearly 18 years ago, according to financial research firm FactSet. Another company with a similar philosophy is Alphabet Inc., the parent company of Google. Amazon just beat Alphabet to the $1,000 level, with its Class A shares just $2 short of $1,000 Tuesday. Only four other U.S.-listed companies have shares trading above $1,000: online travel booking company Priceline Group Inc., homebuilder NVR Inc., pork producer and ocean transportation company Seaboard Corp. and the apostle of long-term investing, Warren Buffett, with his holding company Berkshire Hathaway Inc. But stock prices only tell a part of the story. The value of a company is determined by its stock price and the number of shares on the market. Amazon.com is well over four times the size of Priceline, NVR and Seaboard combined. It’s 17 percent bigger than Berkshire Hathaway, a multinational conglomerate with ownership stakes in some of America’s most well-known consumer brands like Coca-Cola, insurance companies and U.S. infrastructure. Since launching a website to sell mostly books in 1995, Amazon has transfigured retail, sent revenue numbers to stratospheric heights, and is among the biggest reasons longtime powerhouses like Macy’s, Borders bookstores and even RadioShack have suffered. Those companies are closing locations and Amazon is filling the void, sometimes literally. Last week in a location once occupied by Borders, the bookstore chain that went out of business in 2011, Amazon opened its first bookstore in New York City.

Shares of the online retail giant hit a new record high above $1,000 Tuesday. It's an impressive feat. Only one other stock in the S&P 500 -- Priceline -- has a stock price in the quadruple digits. Google parent Alphabet is also rapidly approaching this rarefied air. Its stock was trading at about $993. Amazon stock, which hit a new high of $1,001.20 before pulling back a bit, is now up nearly 35% this year. The company's market value is a staggering $478 billion, twice that of Walmart and trailing only Apple, Alphabet and Microsoft. And Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos is worth about $85 billion, according to Forbes and Bloomberg. That makes him richer than Warren Buffett and in a virtual tie with Spanish retail mogul Amancio Ortega in a tie for second richest person on the planet. Both Bezos and Ortega trail Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates by about $3 billion. Amazon's stock has soared thanks to strong results from its core retail business. It's even been opening physical stores, including a new one in Manhattan last week. The company also has a booming cloud computing business and has started to make bigger moves into media and advertising as well. As for Alphabet, its stock is up more than 25% this year. That's largely due to the continued dominance of its search engine -- and the ad dollars that come with that. But YouTube and Android are also generating more sales and profits for the company. Alphabet also has several so-called "other bets" -- companies like driverless car tech firm Waymo, Fiber and connected device maker Nest -- that are also starting to kick in more revenue. But how significant is it really that Amazon's stock is now above $1,000? It's really just a psychological milestone. Most professional investors don't look at just the stock price. They compare the price to the company's projected earnings. And on that basis, Amazon is pretty expensive. It's trading at about 90 times earnings estimates for next year, much higher than the overall market as well as other tech titans like Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft and Facebook. The main reason that Amazon's share price has gotten to this level is that the company has not done a stock split since 1999. When a company splits its stock, it issues more shares to existing investors. That lowers the price of each share but doesn't change the value of that person's investment -- or the entire company. For example, if you owned 100 shares of a stock trading at $100 and the company decided to split its stock 2 for 1, you'd wind up with 200 shares at a price of $50 each. But investors (and financial reporters) love to focus on big round numbers. They are a lot easier to comprehend. Still, Amazon's and Alphabet's stock prices are important for another reason. If either company ever hope to be added to the illustrious Dow Jones Industrial Average, they will need to split their stock first. That's because the Dow is a price-weighted average and not a market cap-weighted index like the S&P 500. Adding a stock with a price north of $1,000 would give that company an outsized influence on the Dow's daily moves. Investment bank Goldman Sachs has the highest stock price in the Dow right now. But it's only about $220. Thirteen other Dow stocks have a price above $100, including Apple -- which trades at about $154. But Apple wasn't added to the Dow until 2015, a few months after the company did a 7 for 1 stock split that lowered its price from near $650 to about $92.

Its stock topped $1,000 for the first time. That price puts Amazon's market value at about $478 billion, double that of rival Wal-Mart and more than 15 times the size of Target. And its four-digit stock price places it in rare company: Only four other US-listed companies have shares that trade above $1,000. Amazon.com Inc. has come a long way since its start in 1995, when it mostly sold books. The Seattle firm now sells just about anything, from groceries to small appliances, and has been blamed for taking business away from department stores, supermarkets and clothing retailers. - AP Share More > Vote MORE FROM Business Markets Amazon joins $1,000 club That price puts Amazon's market value at about $478 billion READ MORE Technology Annual cybercrime costs set to hit $6T by 2021 With the annual global cybercrime costs set to escalate to an...

Dear Lennard, Yesterday on a ride, a buddy broke a chain link. I had a KMC 10-speed quick link and a tool, we both ride 10 speed Shimano, so the problem was quickly solved. However, we got to wondering about compatibility between drivetrains (9-, 10- and 11-speed, and Shimano/Campy). In a pinch, can you use a 10-speed quick link on an 11-speed (or 9-speed) chain? And do the links work for both Campy and Shimano? — John More Technical FAQ Technical FAQ: More on pedal thread direction Technical FAQ: Pedal threads and frame geometry Technical FAQ: Using Di2 Synchro Shift Technical FAQ: Hydraulic brakes, Van Avermaet’s fork More Technical FAQ Technical FAQ: More on pedal thread direction Lennard Zinn tackles several follow-up questions and comments regarding his recent column on pedal thread direction. Dear John, You can use a 10-speed master link on an 11-speed chain, because the chain is narrower than the master link. But you cannot use a 10-speed master link on a 9-speed chain, because the chain’s inner links will be wider than the inner width of the master link. You might get lucky mating one brand of 10-speed master link that happens to be a bit wider than most with another brand of 9-speed chain that happens to be a bit narrower than most. But in general, I would not expect it to work. Yes, the links work for both Campy and Shimano chains. I raced cyclocross for many years on 10-speed Campy and Shimano chains with Wippermann 10-speed master links holding them together. Same goes for my travel bike, on which I would remove the chain every time I put it in the bike case in order to not have everything end up in a tangle. I did discover, by breaking a master link once, that it is not a good idea to keep using the same master link when you replace your worn-out chain. I hadn’t kept track, but I’m guessing I had replaced that chain at least three times and kept using the same master link over and over. It doesn’t seem like a smart move now, but it sure was easy; hindsight is always 20/20. If you use a master link to hold your chain together, replace it when you replace the chain. ― Lennard More on pedal thread direction Dear Lennard, I understand the mechanics behind the way pedals are threaded, but I can tell you also that I’ve personally helped two riders, with perfectly good pedals, re-attach them after they came off on steep climbs. Regardless of the intent behind the pedal threading, it seems even a good pedal can generate enough friction to slowly but surely unthread, if it’s only hand tightened to start. — Steve Dear Steve, I also have a buddy who came across a guy on a local trail on a brand new mountain bike from Walmart whose pedal had just fallen off. ― Lennard Dear Lennard, I enjoyed your ideas about pedal thread direction but I must disagree with part of your theory. It may be correct that if a bearing seized, and if the pedal weren’t tightened very well on its threads, the pedal would just unscrew rather than breaking the leg of the rider or causing a crash. However, in my long experience working on and riding bicycles, the pedal threads tend to get so tight that they are difficult to loosen even with a wrench. I propose that in 99.99% of cases, if the bearing were to seize (which is a very rare situation nowadays), the pedal would not un-thread. The rider would either have to coast or, if he happened to be on a fixie, would still be likely to crash. Pedals are so infrequently removed, and then they get tightened by the “precession” you mentioned, they are generally so tight that they could not be unscrewed by the rider’s pedaling action even if they bearing seized. —Mike Dear Mike, I used to think that, too, until I saw my daughter pedal off two seized Crank Brothers pedals in cyclocross races. She doesn’t live far from me, but once I help her set her bikes up for the season, she doesn’t tend to ask me to work on them, and we certainly put the pedals on tightly, and those incidents happened in two different seasons. So I’m betting that those pedals were on there very tightly until the bearings started to seize. The constant power washing of ’cross race bikes exposed the propensity of the needle bearings in that 2012ish-era Eggbeaters and Candys to seize up (current models have plastic Igus bushings, and Refresh Kits are available to replace the needle bearings with them). My theory is that the seizing of the pedal is a progressive thing, and as it happens over time, it is gradually unscrewing the pedals. Yes, a shoe attached to a cleat could not unscrew a tight pedal with a frozen bearing. But if the bearing freezes slowly over time, I am convinced that it can. I’ve seen it happen twice when I had firsthand knowledge of the circumstances. ― Lennard More on Di2 Bluetooth and ANT+ connectivity Dear Lennard, So to summarize, the three options are: SM-EWW01: ANT+ only. Will connect to a Garmin that has ANT+. Will not connect to an iPhone, iPad, or Android device for programming. May be obsolete? EW-WU101: ANT+ only. Will connect to a Garmin that has ANT+. Will not connect to an iPhone, iPad, or Android device for programming. EW-WU111: ANT+ and Bluetooth. Will connect to a Garmin that has ANT+. Will also connect to an iPhone, iPad, or Android device for programming via E-Tube. Is that correct? —Ken Dear Ken, You’re correct on the first and third items, but not on the second. Both the EW-WU101 and EW-WU111 are Bluetooth and ANT compatible. They work with the e-Tube app on a phone or tablet as well as with a Garmin. They are interchangeable other than a geometry difference; the EW-WU111 is inline with a port on each end, and the EW-WU101 has both ports on the same end. You can put a D-Fly unit anywhere in the system. The EW-WU111, with ports on either end, facilitates hiding it inside the frame (although the signal will probably be weaker). The simplest method, if it’s done as an afterthought, is to use the EW-WU101 on the lower seat stay. Just unplug the rear derailleur; you run the rear derailleur wire up from where it pops out of the end of the chain stay and plug it into one port on the EW-WU101. Then, run a short wire from the other port to the rear derailleur. The photo is of the EW-WU101 on my gravel road bike, mounted as I just described; I haven’t used the EW-WU111. As long as you’re not using the satellite (climbing) shifter, you can instead use the SC-M9051 or SC-MT800 Bluetooth/ANT+ digital display units for XTR Di2 and XT Di2, respectively, on a road bike. The digital display only has three ports, though. If you’re using a climbing shifter, you need the 5-port Junction A, which is not a transceiver. ― Lennard LATEST MOST READ GEAR RACE REPORTS Pro cycling fixture Sean Weide dies unexpectedly 4 hours ago NEWS Summerhill, UHC part ways following gun charge 8 hours ago NEWS Technical FAQ: Quick links and more pedal thread questions 11 hours ago TECHNICAL FAQ Giro Photo Essay: Fight for pink in fearsome final week 11 hours ago PHOTO ESSAY VIEW ALL NEWS Dumoulin apology doesn’t deter Nibali’s attacks 4 days ago GIRO D'ITALIA Quintana believes late sickness cost him the Giro 3 days ago NEWS Garbage Takes: Giro in the toilet; Tejay is back! 5 days ago COMMENTARY Dumoulin: ‘I made a rookie mistake’ 5 days ago GIRO D'ITALIA Technical FAQ: Quick links and more pedal thread questions 11 hours ago TECHNICAL FAQ Tech FAQ: More on pedal thread direction 1 week ago BIKES AND TECH Canyon sets new standard for women's bikes 2 weeks ago NEWS Week in Tech: Strava commutes, Steve McQueen helmets, new Zipps 2 weeks ago NEWS VIEW ALL GEAR Stage 21: Tom Dumoulin delivers in decisive TT 3 days ago GIRO D'ITALIA Stage 20: Quintana can't break Dumoulin; Pinot wins 4 days ago GIRO D'ITALIA Stage 19: Quintana seizes lead from Dumoulin 5 days ago GIRO D'ITALIA Stage 17: Rolland gives breakaway the slip 7 days ago GIRO D'ITALIA VIEW ALL RACE REPORTS Get VeloNews In Your Inbox Free!

(Published Tuesday, May 30, 2017) The passenger involved in a fiery car crash on Memorial Day in Reading, Massachusetts, is sharing her story for the first time. Seventeen-year-old Allison McCaffrey and her aunt, Laura McCaffrey, were on their way to Wal-Mart, when Laura started to have a seizure behind the wheel. "I kind of just, all of the sudden, heard her scream," recalled McCaffrey. "Then the car just went forward." The teen had little time to react but knew she had to get the car to stop. Reading Crash Survivor Speaks Out The passenger involved in a fiery car crash on Memorial Day in Reading, Massachusetts, is sharing her story for the first time.(Published Tuesday, May 30, 2017) "I didn't really know what to do, so I grabbed onto the wheel," said McCaffrey. "[I] started turning the car on my own, so we didn't crash into any other cars." McCaffrey not only grabbed the wheel, but tried to get her aunt's foot off the gas pedal as she tried to dodge other cars on the road. "I was grabbing on to Laura's leg, trying to move it off the gas, and that's when I noticed the road was taking a curve," said McCaffrey. "And there was a pole in front of me." Mass.

We've got your Memorial Day recovery guide! KPNX 2:17 PM. MST May 30, 2017 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST You partied like a rock star all Memorial Weekend long.  But now good old reality sets in: Your hair is fried, skin's looking lobster red and your energy level is on empty. And guess where you get to return to? Work! So we asked best beauty expert, Stacy Cox, how she would handle this "Code Red" (pun intended) situation?  MOBILIZE WITH THESE SOLUTIONS… 1. HAIR REPAIR… BRAND: got2b Volumaniac Bodify Hairspray SHOP: Walmart Here! PRICE:  $4.22 Does your hair have a case of the blahs today? No umph? No volume? Is it limp and lifeless from overdosing on sun, sweat and chlorine?  An easy way to instantly add a dose of insane volume back into tresses is with the got2b Volumaniac Bodify Hairspray. Not all hairsprays are created equal. Some hold better and smell better than others. Volumaniac is my go-to when I want to prevent a B.H.D. (Bad Hair Day) from raining on my parade. It immediately locks in volume with enough hold for that high, big Texas glamour many of us crave. It works root to tip for a crazy boost OR you target treat specific areas like the roots or your ends. The Secret To Using It: In order to hold crazy volume, position the bottle 8 to 10 inches from hair. Spray evenly over hair for an all over hold or spot spray and use hands to create extra volume. Re-spray after styling to hold dry finished style. For even more insane volume, use in combination with Volumaniac root lifting spray and bodifying mousse.  Bonus Tip: In the event the nozzle clogs, run it under hot water to remove the residue.   2. SKIN SALVATION… BRAND: IASO Extra Hydro Cream (pronounced Ee-ya-so)  SHOP: IASO Here PRICE: $ 48 The day after Memorial Day it's all about a big S.O.S. also known as "Save Our Skin!" I'm super excited to introduce Arizona Midday viewers to IASO. It's an award winning, Korean Skincare Brand that launched this year in the U.S. and you're the first TV viewers anywhere in the U.S. to hear about this Asian import! IASO Extra Hydro Cream works on all skin types: normal, combination and oily complexions and works amazingly in hot climates so it's a slam dunk for this whole town!  For such a reasonable price point, this luxurious cream-gel hydrator delivers on high quality ingredients!  It's infused with 3 of my faves:  aloe, green tea and black willow bark to impart a fresh, lifted look, firmer feeling & radiance to complexions. Big surprise and bonus is it's ability to control excessive sebum and treat pimples caused by oil increase in hot and humid weather. Yet another reason I think IASO made this with Phoenix in mind.  The first thing you notice about it as you apply it is how cool and calming it feels. It's hydrating without the sticky feeling which means men will gravitate to this as much as women. Extra Hydro Cream helps increase the skin's hydration and hold moisture into your skin for 24 hours, while the ingredients work fast to repair damage and restore elastin production to your face which is essential in combating the signs of aging (my arch enemy).   3. MIRACLE MAKEUP BRAND: Neutrogena Hydro Boost Hydrating Tints (10 shades)  PRICE: $14.99 SHOP: Available nationwide now or click here It your face got burned yesterday… and you're heading back to work today… how do you wear makeup over it? The answer is treating the sunburn with hyaluronic serum. It Infuses water and hydration back into your sensitive skin plus has the ability to calm irritation. Neutrogena Hydro Boost Hydrating Tints covers all this ground perfectly and more. These 10 shades of foundation contain the "Hydro Boost" ingredient a weightless, water-gel, oil-free, super fast absorbing hydrator that drenches your skin in hyaluronic serum and hydration for approximately 24 hours. Recently, I got to chat with Scandal star and Neutrogena’s Beauty Partner, Kerry Washington!  Kerry say the best part of Hydro Tints is they won’t cake into lines and make lines look more pronounced. The translation, as she explained it, is you require very few, if any, touchups. So it's one less thing to pay attention to throughout your day!  You have peace of mind knowing your makeup is working for your greatest good!   4.  GOT (ALMOND) MILK? BRAND: The Body Shop Almond Milk & Honey Soothing & Restoring Body Lotion PRICE: $13 SHOP: The Body Shop Stores around the U.S. or click here Make peace with sensitive skin!   The Body Shop's Almond Milk and Honey collection was created to target sensitive skin, enriched with almond milk from Spain and Community Trade honey from Ethiopia. This is perfect over these next few days to relieve any tightness or dry itchiness you might have from a long weekend spent in the sun. The Almond Milk is rich in Vitamin E, an antioxidant that protects cells from free radical damage. The honey is an anti-inflammatory and antibacterial compound that helps to increase healing and tissue regeneration. 2 things you want to target and be sure about before landing anything on sensitive skin is: Is this body care product dermatologically tested? And does it have a hypoallergenic fragrance? The Almond Milk & Honey Body Lotion check out here on both fronts.   © 2017 KPNX-TV CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST JOIN THE CONVERSATION To find out more about Facebook commenting please read the Conversation Guidelines and FAQs Leave a Comment TRENDING VIDEOS Photo leads to animal cruelty investigation Queen Creek 7th grader's slam poem goes viral Valley 7th grader's poem sends powerful message Verify: Dumpster diving for makeup at Ulta?

Mary Altaffer AP Photo National Business May 30, 2017 2:01 PM It's primetime at Amazon.com ... shares hit $1,000 By JOSEPH PISANI AP Business Writer LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story NEW YORK Amazon, the internet goliath that revolutionized the way much of the world buys books, toilet paper and TVs, hit a new milestone Tuesday. Its stock surpassed the $1,000 mark for the first time. That price put Amazon's market value at about $478 billion, double that of the world's biggest traditional retailer, Wal-Mart, and more than 15 times the size of Target. A $1,000 investment on Amazon's first day of trading in 1997 would be worth more than $500,000 today. Not only has Amazon changed the retail landscape since it became a public company 20 years ago, it's now part of a small cadre of high-flying stocks belonging to companies that have defied Wall Street and shunned stock splits. Those splits make the stock more affordable and generate brokerage fees. But companies like Amazon have chosen to reward its long-term investors. The last time Amazon has split its stock was nearly 18 years ago, according to financial research firm FactSet. Another company with a similar philosophy is Alphabet Inc., the parent company of Google. Amazon just beat Alphabet to the $1,000 level, with its Class A shares just $2 short of $1,000 Tuesday. Only four other U.S.-listed companies have shares trading above $1,000: online travel booking company Priceline Group Inc., homebuilder NVR Inc., pork producer and ocean transportation company Seaboard Corp. and the apostle of long-term investing, Warren Buffett, with his holding company Berkshire Hathaway Inc. But stock prices only tell a part of the story. The value of a company is determined by its stock price and the number of shares on the market. Amazon.com is well over four times the size of Priceline, NVR and Seaboard combined. It's 17 percent bigger than Berkshire Hathaway, a multinational conglomerate with ownership stakes in some of America's most well-known consumer brands like Coca-Cola, insurance companies and U.S. infrastructure. Since launching a website to sell mostly books in 1995, Amazon has transfigured retail, sent revenue numbers to stratospheric heights, and is among the biggest reasons longtime powerhouses like Macy's, Borders bookstores and even RadioShack have suffered. Those companies are closing locations and Amazon is filling the void, sometimes literally. Last week in a location once occupied by Borders, the bookstore chain that went out of business in 2011, Amazon opened its first bookstore in New York City.

New, 7 comments by Sean Rueter@s1rude May 30, 2017, 4:15pm EDT tweet share pin Rec Analysis of how WWE’s investment into the Tapout brand has worked for the company hasn’t been exceedingly favorable, but maybe this will be the thing to turn it around. You still can’t see him, but now you can smell like John Cena... Defy the skeptics. Be Unstoppable. @Tapout body spray is now available at @Walmart! pic.twitter.com/mZkXMOsIIB— John Cena (@JohnCena) May 30, 2017 WWE® Superstar John Cena Introduces New Tapout Men’s Body Sprays High-Performance Body Sprays to Bring Out the Unstoppable You NEW YORK, May 30, 2017 — Tapout Body Sprays, a new line of six high-performance scents, is the latest launch for the premier fitness brand Tapout®. The Tapout Body Sprays Collection are now available at Walmart stores and inspires every individual to push the boundaries and ignite the strength needed to break through barriers. As a brand ambassador for Tapout Body Sprays, WWE Superstar John Cena will appear in an action-packed ad campaign and bring to life what the brand represents – discipline, determination and motivation – through exclusive digital content on WWE and Tapout channels, event sponsorships, as well as TV and in-store advertisements. The six performance body sprays come in a diverse range of scents from refreshing and crisp to spicy and musk – including Defy, Victory, Fuel, Focus, Core, and Control. Easy-to-use and high-quality, they are suitable for any occasion for men of all ages. “Motivation, discipline and determination are three values at the core of everything I do on both a personal and professional level,” said Cena. “Whether it’s after a workout, or before an event, Tapout Body Sprays are a great addition to my every day routine.” Cena is an actor, producer, host, entrepreneur and WWE Superstar. In addition to his work in the community, he is a powerhouse on social media with more than 43 million Facebook fans, making him the most popular active U.S. athlete on Facebook. He is also one of the most followed athletes on Twitter and Instagram with 9 and 6 million followers respectively. Cena devotes much of his time working on behalf of numerous charitable causes. He is Make-A-Wish’s most requested wish granter of all time and the only celebrity to grant 500 wishes. He is also committed to Susan G. Komen and has helped raise more than $2 million for breast cancer research and awareness. Cena is a longtime supporter of the U.S. military, recently recognized by USO Metro as the recipient of their 2016 Legacy of Achievement Award. He also starred in Ad Council’s 2016 Love Has No Labels campaign, ‘We Are America’ to further the message of acceptance and love for all communities across the United States. “Tapout Body Sprays put you directly in the moment of action, drive you to defy the odds and step up your game,” said Nelson Miranda, Vice President of Marketing, Global Fragrance at Elizabeth Arden. “As a man who exemplifies passion, confidence and motivation, John Cena is the ideal partner for Tapout Body Sprays. He knows what it takes to keep pushing forward no matter the obstacle.” “We are excited to launch Tapout into the personal care space,” notes Natasha Fishman, EVP of Marketing at Authentic Brands Group, who, in partnership with WWE, owns the Tapout brand. “Extending the brand into body sprays is a great next step for Tapout as it directly correlates to its brand essence which is to inspire the athlete in every individual.” Tapout Body Sprays are launching at WalMart stores and walmart.com in late May 2017 ($7.98). Tapout and the Tapout Logo are trademarks of Tapout, LLC and used under license. Probably should have included some quotes from the future Mrs. Cena, or maybe explained how this assists with “motivation, discipline and determination” (or hustle, loyalty and respect), but otherwise, seems like a solid product launch.

Amazon shares rise above $1,000 for the first time Money Tuesday 30 May 2017 - 5:26pm File: Shares of Amazon breached $1,000 on Tuesday. When the online retailer was first listed 20 years ago they were $18 a share. Photo: AFP PHOTO / Emmanuel Dunand NEW YORK - Shares of Amazon surged above $1,000 for the first time on Tuesday, marking another milestone in the rise of the American online retail giant. At about 14.10 GMT, the company's shares were selling at $997.97, up 0.2 percent after earlier getting as high as $1,001.20. Amazon's market capitalisation stood at about $478-billion, more than twice that of Wal-Mart Stores. After going in public in May 1997 at $18 a share, Amazon has benefited from tectonic shifts in US technology and consumer shopping habits that are expected to continue to remake the retail industry. READ: Amazon expands global reach with Souq.com buy The company has evolved from its origins as an online bookseller into a broad-based retailer of apparel and household staples, from electronics to sausage casing. And with its "Prime" subscription service, it also has become a creative force in Hollywood and beyond. Amazon shares have appreciated especially rapidly over the last three years in anticipation that e-commerce will become a much bigger force in the retail sector. Online sales currently comprise about eight percent of the US retail market. Amazon alone accounts for about 43 percent of US online sales, according to consultancy Slice Intelligence. E-commerce is expected to grow between eight and 12 percent this year, according to the National Retail Federation, about three times as much as the rest of the industry, which has faced massive store and mall closures. Amazon, whose revenues grew to $35.7-billion in the first quarter, has impressed Wall Street by also laying out a plan to achieve greater profitability. It is in the process of investing $1.5-billion to establish its own delivery network and lessen its dependence on shipping giants FedEx and UPS. That will help contain delivery costs, which grew 30 percent to $1.9-billion in the first quarter. The surge above $1,000 a share also raises questions about whether Amazon intends to pursue a stock split. At Amazon's annual meeting a week ago, chief executive Jeff Bezos said the matter was under consideration. The company had three previous stock splits, in June 1998 and in January and August 1999.     AFP Comment Now! Discussion Policy Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

Tech Apple Science Cars Samsung Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 E3 Memorial Day Deals     Nintendo Switch Stock Tracking Report For May 30 Posted: May 31 2017, 1:49am CDT | by Luigi Lugmayr, in News | Technology News     The latest Nintendo Switch stock tracking report for online and in store availability for Tuesday, May 30. On Tuesday, May 30, the Nintendo Switch is not available online. The Switch bundles sold at online at gamestop.com sold out on Memorial Day. The video game retailer offered two new Nintendo Switch bundles priced for under $400.  Don't Miss: Find Rare Products in Stock Online with The Tracker The Nintendo Switch availability hit a low again also at retail locations. As reported earlier, the reason for the low supply is the upcoming E3 2017 video game conference and the release of Arms on June 16. Nintendo will want to have the Switch in stock for the video game show when the buzz hits a new high. The only way to get a Nintendo Switch online now is at reseller market places like Amazon. The Nintendo Switch reseller markups keep steady and range today between $88 to $110 for the Nintendo Switch with Gray Joy-Con and $95 to $130 for the Nintendo Switch with Neon Joy-Con on amazon.com. The Nintendo Switch with Neon Joy-Con is more rare than the console with Gray controllers, resulting in considerable higher market value. Overall the Nintendo Switch market prices have staid flat. Read the reseller offers carefully and check the feedback. Some low priced offers have shipping dates in July. Walmart for the first time in the past two months has not sold the Nintendo Switch online in a bundle on Friday at 5pm ET. The retailer finally reacts to the over selling problem. Our Nintendo Switch order from last Friday got put on backorder days after the order was placed. Update: Walmart has shipped our Nintendo Switch console we ordered as part of a bundle. It will arrive on June 1. Our Nintendo Switch Giveaway will launch soon after we received the Switch in the office. This could mean that Walmart is able to offer limited Nintendo Switch inventory again on walmart.com this Friday at 5pm ET. To find Nintendo Switch in stock online, shoppers can use our new The Tracker app, available as free download for iOS and Android. Further below this report features the latest on the in-store availability of the Nintendo Switch.  Nintendo believes the Nintendo Switch will be as big as the extremely successful Nintendo Wii. Looking at the current shortage, the Japanese video game maker has a long road ahead of them to ship 101 million Nintendo Switch consoles. The positive reception and praise of the Nintendo Switch fuel the demand for the mobile and home console hybrid. Nintendo is also busy marketing the Nintendo Switch with hands-on events and at the E3 2017. Find below the latest Nintendo Switch online availability updates and stock tracking updates for stores. Nintendo Switch Stock at Online Stores There are no options to buy the Nintendo Switch online today. GameStop runs a big video game accessories sale, including discounts of 20% on select Switch accessories. Amazon restocked the Nintendo Switch the last time two weeks ago. Only Prime members got access to the Nintendo Switch stock. When the next Switch sale on Amazon takes place is not known. Use our new Tracker app to get notified when the Switch is in stock at Amazon or other major online retailer. The app is set and forget. When there is a Switch in stock you will receive a notification in real-time on your iPhone or Android phone. The Nintendo Switch will continue to be hard to find for the foreseeable future. Nintendo plans to ship 10 million consoles world-wide in the time from April 2017 to April 2018. From the launch on Mach 3 to April 27, the Mario company sold 2.74 million Switch consoles. The Nintendo Switch reseller markups keep steady and range today between $88 to $110 for the Nintendo Switch with Gray Joy-Con and $95 to $130 for the Nintendo Switch with Neon Joy-Con on amazon.com. The Nintendo Switch with Neon Joy-Con is more rare than the console with Gray controllers, resulting in considerable higher market value. Overall the Nintendo Switch market prices have risen slightly. To find Nintendo Switch in stock online, shoppers can use our new The Tracker app, available as free download for iOS and Android.  There are also several new accessories coming on the market from Nintendo in the next weeks. See the full list of new Nintendo Switch accessories. When is Nintendo Switch in stock online again? Nintendo is ramping up the production for the Nintendo Switch, but has not disclosed what the current production capacity per month is. The demand for the Nintendo Switch will spike during the Holiday Shopping season 2017. Nintendo will set aside a large part of the Switch production during the next months for November and December. This stock piling will keep the Nintendo Switch in short supply during the next 5 months. As Nintendo coordinated new Switch console shipment with the launch of Mario Kart 8, we expect the company to do the same for the next major Switch game launches. This means the next big wave of new Switch consoles comes in mid-June for the release of ARMS. The Nintendo Switch will likely be offered in special bundles in time for the Holidays. A Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Switch bundle has already surfaced in Russia. Because of the incredible demand for the Switch console, the monetary savings on these bundles will be limited. Usually bundles offer a way for consumers to get a free game. Nintendo can afford to just offer some savings, unless the demand is slowing down. Read the latest Nintendo Switch news. How to find a Nintendo Switch in Stock Online We developed the The Tracker app to make finding stock of rare products online as easy and stress free as possible. Download the free app for Apple iPhone or Android phones. From the list products you select to be notified for the Switch with Grey Joy-Con and/or Neon Joy-Con. That is it. It is set and forget. At the moment we detect the Nintendo Switch console in stock at major online retailers, you receive a notification on your smartphone. Now you are just a tap away from buying a Nintendo Switch. You can also see the current availability of the Nintendo Switch consoles in the web version of The Tracker: Nintendo Switch with Gray Joy-Con, Nintendo Switch with Neon Joy-Con. Nintendo Switch in Stock at Stores Best Buy stores had the Nintendo Switch in stock this morning. We prepared our readers for this Switch event before it was official. The Nintendo Switch is also available in 820 Walmart stores, 100 Target stores, 29 GameStop locations according to the Nintendo Switch inventory tracker iStockNow (2:45pm ET).  About 200 more Walmart stores are flagged to have the Nintendo Switch in stock today. The Nintendo flagship store in New York said on April 28 in a tweet to have the Nintendo Switch in stock each morning. People in New York or visitors can give this purchase option a try. Social media posts from people who visited the flagship store confirm the availability of the Switch at the Nintendo store in New York. Some even report that they saw the Switch still on the shelves late afternoon.  This week two new Switch games are released. The big upcoming Switch games are Arms on June 16 and Splatoon 2 on July 21. Amazon offers pre-order discounts on both of the titles for Prime members to the tune of 20%.

Photo Credit: AP advertisement | advertise on newsday Amazon, the internet goliath that revolutionized the way much of the world buys books, toilet paper and TVs, hit a new milestone Tuesday. Its stock surpassed the $1,000 mark for the first time. That price put Amazon's market value at about $478 billion, double that of the world's biggest traditional retailer, Wal-Mart, and more than 15 times the size of Target. A $1,000 investment on Amazon's first day of trading in 1997 would be worth more than $500,000 today. Most Popular LI firm owner seeks younger version of himself LI publishing plant employing 51 to shut down 22 LI Chipotle locations among 2,250 hacked IDA awards $50G for worker-owned businesses LI company considers financial ‘alternatives’ Not only has Amazon changed the retail landscape since it became a public company 20 years ago, it's now part of a small cadre of high-flying stocks belonging to companies that have defied Wall Street and shunned stock splits. Those splits make the stock more affordable and generate brokerage fees. But companies like Amazon have chosen to reward its long-term investors. The last time Amazon has split its stock was nearly 18 years ago, according to financial research firm FactSet. Another company with a similar philosophy is Alphabet Inc., the parent company of Google. Amazon just beat Alphabet to the $1,000 level, with its Class A shares just $2 short of $1,000 Tuesday. advertisement | advertise on newsday Only four other U.S.-listed companies have shares trading above $1,000: online travel booking company Priceline Group Inc., homebuilder NVR Inc., pork producer and ocean transportation company Seaboard Corp. and the apostle of long-term investing, Warren Buffett, with his holding company Berkshire Hathaway Inc. But stock prices only tell a part of the story. The value of a company is determined by its stock price and the number of shares on the market. Amazon.com is well over four times the size of Priceline, NVR and Seaboard combined. It's 17 percent bigger than Berkshire Hathaway, a multinational conglomerate with ownership stakes in some of America's most well-known consumer brands like Coca-Cola, insurance companies and U.S. infrastructure. Since launching a website to sell mostly books in 1995, Amazon has transfigured retail, sent revenue numbers to stratospheric heights, and is among the biggest reasons longtime powerhouses like Macy's, Borders bookstores and even RadioShack have suffered. Those companies are closing locations and Amazon is filling the void, sometimes literally. Last week in a location once occupied by Borders, the bookstore chain that went out of business in 2011, Amazon opened its first bookstore in New York City. Get the Biz Briefing newsletter!

The losses threaten a seven-day winning streak for major stock indexes. Advertisement Technology companies and consumer-focused companies continue to climb. Amazon.com is among them. It briefly surpassed $1,000 a share for the first time. Security software maker Symantec, chipmaker Nvidia and 3 percent and Micron Technology are also gaining. International airlines slumped as the government considered expanding a ban on laptops from the passenger cabins of flights to the United States. CONSUMER CONFIDENCE Consumer confidence slips in May but still at high levels WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. consumers were slightly less confident in May for the second straight month, but they remain bullish overall. The Conference Board says its consumer confidence index fell to 117.9 from 120.3 in April. The index hit 124.9 in March, its highest mark in 16 years. The index that measures consumers’ feelings about the current economic situation increased slightly, while the index measuring consumers’ sentiment about the future was down slightly. Consumers’ outlook for the job market was also mixed. Economists closely monitor the mood of consumers because their spending makes up about 70 percent of U.S. economic activity. CONSUMER SPENDING US consumer spending, incomes grew solidly in April WASHINGTON (AP) — Americans increased their spending in April at the fastest pace in four months, bolstered by a solid gain in incomes. The strong results underscored expectations that the economy is poised to rebound after a lackluster start to the year. The Commerce Department says consumer spending rose 0.4 percent in April after a 0.3 percent rise in March. It was the best showing since December. Incomes rose 0.4 percent. Consumer spending, which accounts for 70 percent of economic activity, grew at the slowest pace in seven years in the first quarter. That was a key reason the economy expanded by just 1.2 percent at the start of the year. Economists are hopeful growth will rebound to around 3 percent in the current April-June quarter. HOME PRICES US home prices rising 2 times faster than wages WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. home prices climbed in March at the strongest rate in nearly three year as a dwindling supply of houses for sale is causing prices to significantly outpace income growth. The Standard & Poor’s CoreLogic Case-Shiller 20-city home price index rose 5.9 percent over the past 12 months ended in March, the most since July 2014. Home values are increasing at more than double the pace of average hourly earnings, making it more difficult for many people to afford to buy a home. A steady job market has bulked up demand among many would-be buyers, but there are fewer properties on the market. Sales listings have plummeted 9 percent over the past year to 1.93 million, according to the National Association of Realtors. AMAZON-1K STOCK Amazon’s stock tops $1,000 for the first time UNDATED (AP) — Amazon stock reached a milestone today, topping at $1,000 for the first time. That puts the e-commerce giant’s market value at $478 billion, double that of rival Wal-Mart and more than 15 times the size of Target. And its four-digit stock price places it in rare company: Only four other U.S.-listed companies have shares that trade above $1,000. Amazon.com Inc. has come a long way since its start in 1995, when it mostly sold books. The Seattle company now sells just about anything, from groceries to small appliances, and has been blamed for taking business away from department stores, supermarkets and clothing retailers. GENERAL MOTORS STOCK Proxy fight over GM stock heats up ahead of annual meeting DETROIT (AP) — Shares of General Motors are rising as a proxy fight escalates between the company and an activist shareholder who wants to split its shares into two classes. David Einhorn’s Greenlight Capital says it’s sending a letter to shareholders emphasizing that the stock price has barely grown since GM’s initial public offering at $33 seven years ago. GM pointed out last week that two independent, corporate evaluation firms, ISS and Glass Lewis, recommended against the proposal. Shares of GM rose 1 percent to $33.40 shortly after the opening bell. Greenlight’s plan would create one dividend-paying stock and one “capital allocation” stock designed for growth. GM says the stock split is too risky. A vote will take place in one week at the annual shareholders meeting on June 6. WESSON OIL SOLD Conagra Brands sells Wesson brand for $285M to Smucker OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — Conagra Brands is selling Wesson oil for $285 million to the J.M. Smucker Company as it continues to reshape the company to focus on its strongest consumer brands. Conagra CEO Sean Connolly says the Wesson sale is part of the reorganization that he has overseen since taking over in 2015. Conagra moved its headquarters to Chicago from Omaha, Nebraska, and unloaded its store brand and frozen potato businesses. Smucker says Wesson is expected to add $230 million in sales and roughly $30 million in pretax earnings. CEO Mark Smucker says Wesson will complement its Crisco brand nicely. Conagra will initially continue producing Wesson after the sale until the work moves to Smucker’s existing oil manufacturing plant in Cincinnati, Ohio. CHINA-TRUMP TRADEMARKS Senate Democrats ask Trump for answers on China trademarks SHANGHAI (AP) — Senate Democrats have sent a letter to U.S. President Donald Trump requesting information about a raft of trademark approvals from China this year that they say may violate the U.S. Constitution’s ban on gifts from foreign governments. The eight senators say in the letter today that China’s rapid approval of the trademarks after years of court battles raised questions about whether they would prevent Trump from standing up to China on behalf of American workers and their businesses. China has granted or provisionally granted 40 trademarks to the president and a related company, DTTM Operations LLC, since his inauguration. If there are no objections, provisional approvals are formally registered after 90 days. China has also rejected or partially rejected nine Trump trademarks since the inauguration. BRITAIN-BRITISH AIRWAYS Shares in British Airways’ parent company tumble LONDON (AP) — Shares in British Airways’ parent company tumbled today after a catastrophic IT failure stranded thousands of passengers during a long holiday weekend. Shares in the International Airlines Group dropped about 3 percent in the first day of trading after a weekend that saw hundreds of flights canceled after a power surge led to an IT meltdown. Although the airline is running a full schedule of flights today, it acknowledges that passengers are still facing baggage delays. The company has apologized, but shareholders have not been forgiving. Kathleen Brooks, the research director at City Index, says investors are concerned the troubles suggested that cost-cutting at IAG have gone too far. THREE MILE ISLAND Owner says Three Mile Island plant to shut down in 2019 HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — The owner of Three Mile Island, site of the United States’ worst commercial nuclear power accident, says it will shut down the plant in 2019 without a financial rescue from Pennsylvania. Exelon Corp. says Monday’s announcement comes after five years of losses on the power plant and its recent failure in an auction to sell Three Mile Island’s power into the regional grid. The Chicago-based energy company wants Pennsylvania to give nuclear power megawatts the kind of preferential treatment and premium payments that are given to renewable energies, such as wind and solar. Nuclear power plants have been hammered by the natural gas boom that has slashed electricity prices in competitive markets. Equipment failure and operator errors at Three Mile Island in 1979 led to partial core meltdown of a reactor. The plant’s other reactor is still in use. COAL POWER PLANTS CLOSING PSEG closing its 2 final New Jersey coal-fired power plants HAMILTON TOWNSHIP, N.J. (AP) — The largest energy provider in New Jersey is set to close its final coal-fired power plants. Public Service Enterprise Group will close the Mercer and Hudson generation stations on Thursday as inexpensive natural gas has made it no longer profitable to run the coal plants. Ralph Izzo, chief executive of PSEG Power, tells the Philadelphia Inquirer that the company made a bad bet on high gas prices. The company took a $555 million loss on the plant closures last year and expects to write off up to $960 million this year. MIAMI MEGAMALL Retail-tainment: Don’t call biggest US mall in Miami a mall MIAMI (AP) — Call it retail-tainment. Just don’t call American Dream Miami a mall. Developers are proposing a massive 6 million-square-foot (557,000 square-meter) project on the edge of the Everglades in bustling South Florida that would dwarf any other shopping mecca in North America, including Minnesota’s Mall of America. Miami-Dade County officials could approve it this fall, despite criticism that it will worsen the region’s already choking traffic problem and produce mostly low-paying jobs. And malls have been in decline as shoppers flock to the internet. Developer Triple Five Worldwide Group of Edmonton, Canada, says this will be different, combining retail space with an indoor ski slope, a water park, a submarine ride attraction, a skating rink, 2,000 hotel rooms, theaters, a performing arts center, and places to eat and drink. FEARLESS GIRL-DOG Urinating dog statue briefly placed near ‘Fearless Girl’ art NEW YORK (AP) — A New York City artist says he was expressing himself by placing the statue of a dog relieving itself near Wall Street’s “Fearless Girl” sculpture. Artist Alex Gardega tells The New York Post that he thinks “Fearless Girl” is a disrespectful publicity stunt and “has nothing to do with feminism.” He says the urinating dog id a form of counter protest. A financial firm installed “Fearless Girl” in March as a statement about the lack of women on the boards of big U.S. corporations. It faces the famous “Charging Bull” statue.

Its stock surpassed the $1,000 mark for the first time. That price put Amazon's market value at about $478 billion, double that of the world's biggest traditional retailer, Wal-Mart, and more than 15 times the size of Target. A $1,000 investment on Amazon's first day of trading in 1997 would be worth more than $500,000 today. Not only has Amazon changed the retail landscape since it became a public company 20 years ago, it's now part of a small cadre of high-flying stocks belonging to companies that have defied Wall Street and shunned stock splits. Those splits make the stock more affordable and generate brokerage fees. But companies like Amazon have chosen to reward its long-term investors. The last time Amazon has split its stock was nearly 18 years ago, according to financial research firm FactSet. Another company with a similar philosophy is Alphabet Inc., the parent company of Google. Amazon just beat Alphabet to the $1,000 level, with its Class A shares just $2 short of $1,000 Tuesday. Only four other U.S.-listed companies have shares trading above $1,000: online travel booking company Priceline Group Inc., homebuilder NVR Inc., pork producer and ocean transportation company Seaboard Corp. and the apostle of long-term investing, Warren Buffett, with his holding company Berkshire Hathaway Inc. But stock prices only tell a part of the story. The value of a company is determined by its stock price and the number of shares on the market. Amazon.com is well over four times the size of Priceline, NVR and Seaboard combined. It's 17 percent bigger than Berkshire Hathaway, a multinational conglomerate with ownership stakes in some of America's most well-known consumer brands like Coca-Cola, insurance companies and U.S. infrastructure. Since launching a website to sell mostly books in 1995, Amazon has transfigured retail, sent revenue numbers to stratospheric heights, and is among the biggest reasons longtime powerhouses like Macy's, Borders bookstores and even RadioShack have suffered. Those companies are closing locations and Amazon is filling the void, sometimes literally. Last week in a location once occupied by Borders, the bookstore chain that went out of business in 2011, Amazon opened its first bookstore in New York City. _____ Contact Joseph Pisani at http://twitter.com/josephpisani Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Hicks, who is Mexican-American and has lived in the U.S. for the past 28 years, posted the racially charged video to Facebook, receiving 26 million views in just a week. 0:59 Hot air balloon crash can't stop these lovebirds Stephen Martin thought that proposing to his girlfriend, Christine Peters, would result in a romantic and picturesque ride across the Canadian countryside. Instead, the balloon crashed into a tree during a botched landing attempt, sending the craft and the couple's romantic story spiraling out of control. Luckily, no one was injured and Peters said yes. 0:47 After 17 years of trying to conceive, woman gives birth to sextuplets Jibola Taiwo gave birth to sextuplets via C-section after 17 years of trying to conceive a child. It took a team of 40 to perform the operation at VCU Medical Center in Richmond, Virginia. The largest of the newborns is just 2 pounds, 15 ounces, and the smallest weighs only a pound. Taiwo's baby story is extremely rare. In 2015, only 24 of the 4 million live births in the US were quintuplets, sextuplets or higher. 1:37 This overbred French bulldog has no eyes Milly is a dog with no eyes but a lot of heart. Due to overbreeding, the French bulldog was born with bulging eyeballs that were prone to infection. A vet tech from Israel named Christin came to the rescue, paying for the surgery to have Milly's eyes removed. Now the 2-year-old pup is playful and pain-free, enjoying life with her brothers Thai, Shon, and Punch, who help the blind pooch get around. 0:33 Ape hurls huge rock at Florida zoo visitors A bonobo at a Florida zoo shocked people visiting the exhibit when it hurled a large chunk of concrete at the crowd. Fortunately, nobody was injured, and zoo officials believe that the ape was just being playful and was likely unaware of the dangers of its actions. 1:15 This woman is one unlikely Mormon Allegra Cole grew up in the Mormon faith, but now the 47-year-old beauty has a new passion: showing the world her gargantuan breasts. The glamour model earns up to $100,000 a year, and has undergone three boob jobs, a tummy tuck and a butt lift to get her desired physique. "I want to be the 21st-century poster woman for carrying big breasts," she said. 1:41 This woman married a train station She choo-choo-chose a train station to be her life partner. Carol Santa Fe, a self-identified objectum sexual, says she’s been in love with San Diego’s historic Santa Fe train depot since the age of 9. “We first consummated our love a few years ago when I felt the wall behind me, and I felt this energy,” she says, claiming she and “Daidra” have been romantic since 2011. “I came close to an orgasm and I was scared I’d get caught by the station staff.” Carol joins the list of people attracted to famous structures, including Erika Eiffel and Eklöf Berliner-Mauer, who “married” the Berlin Wall in 1979. 1:14 Cocky skier survives 60-foot drop into a crevasse A skier in Switzerland named Jamie Mullner tumbled 60 feet into a crevasse, despite being warned about the deep hole. Fortunately for him, his friends witnessed the fall, and the unscathed 26-year-old was able to radio for help from underground. "I was pretty sure I was going to die or get horrifically injured," Mullner said. “It only takes a few seconds to get a little carried away and often you don't get a second chance like I did.” 0:46 'Robocop' searches for wanted criminals and pretty faces in Dubai mall The first robotic police officer debuted at a mall in Dubai, and it's putting a friendly face on the future of robotics. The cop was shown communicating with shoppers, and even "flirted" with at least one woman. 0:59 Man brought to tears seeing colors for the first time Enchroma glasses allow people with color blindness to experience a wider spectrum of colors.

Credit: ayo888/iStock As more consumers participate in brand loyalty programs, more of those loyalty points are going unclaimed -- to the tune of $100 billion, according to marketing firm Bond Brand Loyalty. The problem for marketers is that if consumers aren't taking advantage of the points they're accumulating by cashing them in, they may not have a positive view of the program. (Worse, unclaimed rewards create a financial liability for brands.) There are number of reasons why such bounty is left sitting in wallets. It is in part a question of educating consumers: Some brand loyalty marketers are failing to communicate reminders about redeemable points to program members. "Some people don't redeem because they are disengaged with the program, even to the extent that they don't know their current points balance or what redemption options are available to them," said Sean Claessen, executive VP of strategy and innovation at Bond Brant Loyalty. Source: Bond Brand Loyalty's 2017 Loyalty Report A recent study by Accenture found that 77% of consumers participate in some kind of a retail loyalty program, 46% have joined a hotel program, and 40% are part of an airline program–up from 72%, 36%, and 31% over the last year, respectively. Brand loyalty programs that rate highest when it comes to ease of points tracking and account activity were Papa John's Papa Rewards, Domino's Pizza Pizza Profile, MyMK from Mary Kay Cosmetics, Walmart Savings Catcher and H-E-B Points Club Rewards, from the Texas-based grocery chain. However, not all loyalty customers are in it just for the immediate reward of cheaper gas or cash back on purchases. According to Claessen, some loyalty members have a method to what seems like the madness of not redeeming. Some points hoarders, for instance, prefer to maintain a minimum balance of grocery loyalty points just in case they forget their wallet while picking up last-minute ingredients for dinner. And others are aspirational -- building up points to score flights or hotel reservations for that once-in-a-lifetime vacation. In other words, Claessen said, unredeemed points aren't always a signal that marketers are doing something wrong. However, he added, there probably is room for improvement in many cases. "To improve member engagement and drive redemption behavior, you should encourage goal setting, foster better awareness of accumulation status and communicate progress on a regular basis." To arrive at its $100 billion tally, the company surveyed more than 28,000 consumers in the US and Canada in relation to more than 400 different loyalty programs from credit card and airline loyalty to casual dining and retail. It calculated the value of the average balance of unredeemed points in each loyalty sector evaluated, factoring in the number of consumers in those programs and their activity rates. For consumers, the promise of loyalty programs are the rewards. So, it stands to reason that if they aren't redeeming points, they may not feel as though that promise is fulfilled. It turns out, according to the Bond report, redeemers are twice as likely to be highly satisfied with their programs than non-redeemers, and only a quarter of loyalty members are very satisfied with the level of effort required to earn a reward or benefit. Plus, a lot of people have no idea what benefits they qualify for because they don't know their points levels. According to the report, 57% of members don't know their points balance, and 38% are unaware of their points value.

That price put Amazon's market value at about $478 billion, double that of the world's biggest traditional retailer, Wal-Mart, and more than 15 times the size of Target. A $1,000 investment on Amazon's first day of trading in 1997 would be worth more than $500,000 today. Not only has Amazon changed the retail landscape since it became a public company 20 years ago, it's now part of a small cadre of high-flying stocks belonging to companies that have defied Wall Street and shunned stock splits. Those splits make the stock more affordable and generate brokerage fees. But companies like Amazon have chosen to reward its long-term investors. The last time Amazon has split its stock was nearly 18 years ago, according to financial research firm FactSet. Another company with a similar philosophy is Alphabet Inc., the parent company of Google. Amazon just beat Alphabet to the $1,000 level, with its Class A shares just $2 short of $1,000 Tuesday. Only four other U.S.-listed companies have shares trading above $1,000: online travel booking company Priceline Group Inc., homebuilder NVR Inc., pork producer and ocean transportation company Seaboard Corp. and the apostle of long-term investing, Warren Buffett, with his holding company Berkshire Hathaway Inc. But stock prices only tell a part of the story. The value of a company is determined by its stock price and the number of shares on the market. Amazon.com is well over four times the size of Priceline, NVR and Seaboard combined. It's 17 percent bigger than Berkshire Hathaway, a multinational conglomerate with ownership stakes in some of America's most well-known consumer brands like Coca-Cola, insurance companies and U.S. infrastructure. Since launching a website to sell mostly books in 1995, Amazon has transfigured retail, sent revenue numbers to stratospheric heights, and is among the biggest reasons longtime powerhouses like Macy's, Borders bookstores and even RadioShack have suffered. Those companies are closing locations and Amazon is filling the void, sometimes literally. Last week in a location once occupied by Borders, the bookstore chain that went out of business in 2011, Amazon opened its first bookstore in New York City. _____ Contact Joseph Pisani at http://twitter.com/josephpisani Get news headlines sent daily to your inbox Sign Up!

MTV By Mark Shrayber May 30, 2017 I have seen paradise and this is what it looks like: Three teen moms, one Puerto Rican vacation, and an unlimited supply of tears. In paradise, there are paddle boats and kayaks. Amber frowns on the beach instead of indoors. Matt is downed over and over by waves that know exactly what he is. Catelynn swims in a pool on her balcony, whooping over and over and for no reason. And Maci convinces her castmate that the only appropriate place to hide birthday decorations are high between one’s legs and inside a well-filled bra. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below In paradise, the men of Teen Mom OG enjoy cocktails that are meant to simulate “coochie cream.” In paradise, Catelynn sees a rooster and does not immediately demand one for her own. In paradise, there is no Farrah Abraham, but she is constantly being talked about, as if she may jump from behind any corner in FroCo sunglasses and “public speak” about her business ventures, which she dove into after having a child and realizing that no one could fill the frozen yogurt and “reasonably priced furniture sold by bored teens who want to be on TV” niche as well as she, a mom, could. Close your eyes and picture paradise with me, friend. Do you see an endless high-speed montage of store and restaurant names which provided promotional consideration for Catelynn’s tropical vacation? Can you hear the happy laughter of three women who don’t know that Puerto Rico isn’t Mexico or Spain? Open your eyes: you’re there. Catelynn, Maci, and Amber Your grandparents may have listened to songs that extolled the pleasures of a heaven meant for two, but if there’s one thing we all learned this week, it’s that paradise isn’t paradise unless it involves five people and a sentient pile of hot garbage talking shit about a seventh person who wasn’t invited. And because all three stars of this show — Farrah isn’t really a person of import, the other women agreed, while having another conversation about her — converged upon one resort for a week of more tears than laughter, I’m lumping all of them into one glorious section, a “smorgashorgasbjrhfbfhhifbhfurd” (to quote Catelynn) of earthly delights. It begins with invitations: Catelynn wants to do something special for her birthday so she asks Amber and Maci (and their partners, Phil Robertson and a bin of trash left outside too long on a hot day) to hop a plane and get their butts to Puerto Rico for some fun in the sun (“overcast but very warm” just doesn’t have the same ring to it.) Both enthusiastically agree, although Matt and Amber are still fighting about everything and Maci’s worried about Ryan (on drugs) and Bentley (needs a ride to soccer practice). Advertisement - Continue Reading Below In Puerto Rico, Catelynn tells Tyler that she’s really excited to eat some “really good Spanish food” and then waxes poetic about how she should have been born Spanish instead of a white girl in Michigan. She lists the criteria for why she’d make an excellent spaniard: Catelynn loves the men, the culture, the black beans. There’s probably a whole lot more that she said — certainly Catelynn wouldn’t reduce an entire people to “hot guys” and “frijoles” — but we don’t see any of that because it is at this moment that Amber and the piece of trash she totes around on a string join the couple for lunch. Amber, who was not destined to be born Spanish like Catelynn, suggests that they have sandwiches for lunch. But like really good sandwiches. The ladies leave the hotel to buy food and find themselves in a supermarket where they decide that they want to surprise Catelynn with whatever decorations are on hand in aisle nine. Amber and Maci discuss how to hide the decorations so that they may remain a surprise and try “between Amber’s legs” and “all up in Amber’s bra” before settling on “let’s get Catelynn outside while the guys check out so she can’t see what we’re getting.” Not that it matters, though. The guys are pushing so many pallets of alcohol to the counter that no one would ever notice a “Happy Birthday” banner and a couple of balloons among the many bottles of Bud Light and tequila they’re about to get turnt on. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below But then it gets serious: Because no trip would be complete without tears and Amber once again storming off for seemingly no reason (to be explained in great detail to producers later), the ladies begin a series of heart-to-hearts about what it’s like to be a Teen Mom, how difficult marriage is, and how much they’ve all learned. MTV First up in the hot seat is Catelynn, who has to leave the group during a discussion of postpartum depression. Maci says that she suffered from it after giving birth to Jayde, which leads to a conversation about whether moms suffer postpartum with every kid, which eventually leads to a conversation about Carlie (the daughter Catelynn and Tyler gave up for adoption). Catelynn wanders off to be by herself for a while because it’s just too intense to talk about her first child on vacation and Tyler tells the others that Catelynn feels really guilty about giving her first child up for adoption and that she may think that she messed up, which is totally understandable. It was a hard decision for the couple then, and it must be even harder in hindsight because of all of the success that Catelynn and Tyler have had since the show first aired. It must feel really unfair to Catelynn that she is able to give Nova so much when she was able to give Carlie so little (although, to be fair, Carlie’s parents seem like they’re doing a really great job; they’re just not Catelynn.) Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Amber reveals that she plans to tie the knot with the trash can within which Oscar The Grouch resides (Matt) sometime this year but that she can’t do it without perfect trust (what is this, The Craft?) because of all the lying Matt has done (really wish Farrah was here so we could have a convo about Matt hitting on her). She’s learning that she doesn’t know Matt as well as she thought and says that the same thing happened with Gary, who she thought she knew completely but it turned out he was an enigma wrapped inside of a riddle. Fair enough, I guess, but I’d argue that it’s Amber’s lack of observational skills and not people changing that’s the problem. After all, Gary Shirley is exactly the same person he was when he bought himself a Playstation at Walmart and then purchased Amber an engagement ring as an afterthought. Catelynn says that there will always be bumps, but I’m pretty sure she’d have a different opinion after watching last week’s episode. Bumps are one thing — my husband and I argue regularly over the fact that “earning Visa Rewards points” isn’t a viable hobby — but straight-up calling your mentally ill partner a “psycho” on television? That’s more like a pot hole that will never be filled in to anyone’s satisfaction, leading the residents of the street that live around it to make viral Facebook memes begging the government to do something about the poor conditions of heavily-trafficked roads. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Suddenly, the conversation — these are all separate conversations but they’re all cut in such a way that it seems like the ladies are having one long reunion — turns to alcoholism. Amber says that her father was an alcoholic and then quickly asks to change the subject, which Matt says he’s happy to do while continuing to talk about it. No one else is stopping him, so Amber walks away crying. When producers catch up to her, she tells them that her dad was very sick and stayed alive to watch her get married, but that it didn’t happen. He knew that she was engaged — although he didn’t know Matt — but he didn’t get to walk Amber down the aisle which is something that eats at her to this day. Maybe that’s why she can’t just break up with Matt? I know that TV only shows us a small part of their relationship, but wouldn’t it make some sense if one of Amber’s concerns was that she promised her dad she was marrying Matt and that breaking up with him would be an unspoken betrayal of her father’s final wishes? This is a question we don’t get an answer to because it’s Maci’s turn to spill her guts about what’s going on in her life. She reveals that, yes, Ryan is on drugs and that no one around him — except her, but she shouldn't be the one to walk him through this — is doing anything about it. Amber agrees that Ryan is in a bad way and Maci breaks down about how unfair all of it is. And she’s right: She’s constantly being painted as a villain, her ex’s snake of a fiancé is trying to convince Ryan to sue Maci for custody instead of getting himself right, and Jen and Larry are now so used to dealing with Ryan’s bullshit that they’ve convinced themselves he’s doing just fine even though even the casual observer can see that he’s completely checked out 98 percent of the time. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below But it gets worse: It turns out that Ryan is in such bad shape that Maci stays up at night weeping that she may wake up to news that he’s died. Amber suggests that Ryan needs to find his rock bottom, and she’s not wrong, but I can’t help but think that having your ex weep for you on a nightly basis because she thinks you’re going to overdose in a ditch somewhere, leaving your son without his biological father, should be enough of a wake-up call. Why won’t the other people in Ryan’s life speak out the same way Maci’s doing? It’s not all tears, though. The trip ends with the gang throwing Catelynn an excellent birthday dinner and everyone lives and laughs and loves and learns and vows to stay friends forever and have each other’s back but also never to let Farrah come on a trip because she is not important and a terrible human being who has accomplished nothing in her life and only sullies the whole concept of teen moms with her existence. Meanwhile… Farrah Ms. Abraham (if you’re nasty) is doing great after her hypnotherapy session and thinks that being put under has been the breakthrough that she needed. I immediately start worrying this means that Farrah will either a) go to school to become a hypnotherapist or b) decide to open a hypnotherapy center between FroCo and Furnished By Farrah (the hypnotist will wear a FroCo costume to create synergy), but she’s much more focused on being single (hard when Simon is calling her all the time and she won’t tell him to stop) and establishing her career as a business expert. In fact, she’s been invited to speak at a SWXW house party/branding summit, which is both very exciting and a disaster waiting to happen. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below To showcase her business acumen, Farrah stops by her yogurt shop, where the only employee left standing in the horrifying space uniform Farrah insists on is Michael (her dad), and even that’s not for sure. First, Farrah informs Michael that he hung up the “open” sign too early, which is unprofessional (not really, the place isn’t hopping or anything) and then, when he tries to explain that he had a huge mess the day before which he cleans up, she tells him that she doesn’t need to hear about it because of bad vibes and negativity. “There. is. no. mess.” she says in the tone I imagine the interrogator in 1984 used when getting ready to torture the protagonist. If Farrah doesn’t believe there’s a mess then no mess ever existed, and besides, she has to go “public speak,” and no one should be bothering her with business concerns only hours before she appears at a “summit” to discuss her businesses. That’s tip #1, aspiring entrepreneurs: Make your own reality and then punish anyone that doesn’t agree with it. Michael says he wishes he could go see Farrah speak, but she says she prefers him to stay in the yogurt shop (which is a sound business decision as he is her only employee). It turns out that he’s not just a simple yogurt dispenser and cashier, though. Michael is also Farrah’s consultant (she asks him whether she should wear novelty glasses that advertise her business throughout her entire speech) as well as her personal assistant (she has him answer her phone and talk to Simon while she listens in, pretending that she is tied up with important business things and cannot speak to him). Farrah’s dad is basically Cinderella, except he doesn’t have a fairy godmother who will take over his job and let him see Farrah talk about being a titan of industry. (In this situation, the fairy godmother would be Debra, dressed in her DEBZ OG music video outfit. She wouldn’t actually grant wishes, but she’d appear in a puff of cigarette smoke and rap her song until the police were called.) (Actually, that just sounds like Debra on a Tuesday.) Advertisement - Continue Reading Below At the summit, Farrah is in full “business” mode. In response to a simple “hello” she says she’s delighted to see so many entrepreneurs in the audience. When asked about her passions, she says that she loves food, fashion, and furnishings, which are all different in their own way. She explains that, as a mom (and a woman who went to school for restaurants), she knew she had to get into the frozen yogurt business because she could do it better than anyone else and she tells the assembled audience that she’s opened three businesses in the past six months, which sounds like the worst kind of business advice (the poor moderator is white-knuckling this thing) and that everyone with the right spirit could do the same. Well, as long as they were on Teen Mom and then also had a book written for them and also got paid for a sex tape or something. Just, you know, follow your heart. Farrah says she’s open to answer questions after she’s done speaking, but the only person who seems to be interested in her business is a blogger from Elite Daily with whom Farrah connects over the fact that the blogger is Egyptian (just like Simon!). Where is Farrah going next? Probably to Los Angeles. San Diego is all well and good, she says, but LA is where she can really get some work done. Question one: What kind of work? Is Farrah planning on opening another furniture store or a frozen yogurt location in a city that’s choked with them? Question two: Wouldn’t it make more sense, as a businesswoman who has just opened three businesses in six months, to stay close by and monitor how they’re doing before expanding? It seems impossible that her ventures in an already crowded market have shown profits in such a short time and it seems like a good idea to be focusing on what she already has instead of throwing her money into more businesses. But don’t take my word for it. I’m just some dude with conservative ideas. Farrah’s the one who was invited to be an expert on a panel for businesspeople. And you don’t get rich by not taking giant risks that make no logical sense. (Oh, what? You do? Who’s going to tell Farrah?) Follow Mark on Twitter and Cosmo Celeb on Facebook.

Easy-to-use and high-quality, they are suitable for any occasion for men of all ages.

He is also one of the most followed athletes on Twitter and Instagram with 9 and 6 million followers respectively. Cena devotes much of his time working on behalf of numerous charitable causes. He is Make-A-Wish’s most requested wish granter of all time and the only celebrity to grant 500 wishes. He is also committed to Susan G. Komen and has helped raise more than $2 million for breast cancer research and awareness. Cena is a longtime supporter of the U.S. military, recently recognized by USO Metro as the recipient of their 2016 Legacy of Achievement Award. He also starred in Ad Council’s 2016 Love Has No Labels campaign, ‚We Are America’ to further the message of acceptance and love for all communities across the United States. „Tapout Body Sprays put you directly in the moment of action, drive you to defy the odds and step up your game,” said Nelson Miranda, Vice President of Marketing, Global Fragrance at Elizabeth Arden. „As a man who exemplifies passion, confidence and motivation, John Cena is the ideal partner for Tapout Body Sprays. He knows what it takes to keep pushing forward no matter the obstacle.” „We are excited to launch Tapout into the personal care space,” notes Natasha Fishman, EVP of Marketing at Authentic Brands Group, who, in partnership with WWE, owns the Tapout brand. „Extending the brand into body sprays is a great next step for Tapout as it directly correlates to its brand essence which is to inspire the athlete in every individual.” Tapout Body Sprays are launching at WalMart stores and www.walmart.com in late May 2017 ($7.98).

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 30 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman 4 High-Yield Stocks to Sell Before Summer Starts Shutterstock photo By Brett Owens Sometimes it’s best to sell in May and just stay away . Especially when a firm’s dividend stream is being eaten alive by Amazon & Co. The Wall Street Journal’s Mark Hulbert studied the „summer rally myth” last year – and concluded it is indeed a good time to sell: „Over the past 60 years, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has produced an average monthly return of just 0.1% during these three summer months, compared with a 0.7% average for all other months.” Worse, even skilled market timers don’t have much to work with. Hulbert found that over the past 60 years, rallies from June’s lows into highs over the next two months averaged 6.9% – the third-lowest such rally potential, behind (you guessed it) July and August. So should we buy these names back in September? For this disastrous four, just sell and stay away. Target ( TGT ) Dividend Yield: 4.3% Big-box retailer Target ( TGT ) has lost roughly a third of its value since 2016, and unfortunately, there’s no single thing to pin it on – and thus no single quick fix. The company is throwing things against the wall to see what will stick, introducing new brands and expanding its small-format stores while trying to squeeze more sales out of its website. But Target still is struggling to get customers through the door – something GlobalData Managing Director Neil Saunders says „is getting worse over time, especially among younger millennial consumers.” Whether Target can do it remains to be seen, but it’s swimming upstream against Amazon.com ( AMZN ) and the growing sprawl of e-commerce, including an increasingly feisty Walmart ( WMT ) . And your reward for holding on while Target tries to successfully execute a turnaround strategy? A risky 4.3%. You can find surer retailers and higher dividend payers. Don’t wait up for Target. Has Target ( TGT ) Peaked? FirstEnergy ( FE ) Dividend Yield: 5.1% When you think utilities, a few words come to mind: „Stability.” „Dividends.” „Bankruptcy” shouldn’t be one of them. That’s a word increasingly being floated about concerning Ohio-based utility FirstEnergy ( FE ) , however, which is among the riskiest plays in the sector right now. Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis report author Cathy Kunkel says that six of FirstEnergy’s coal and nuclear plants are at risk . „In the fourth quarter of 2016, FES took an $8 billion loss to write down the value of its remaining coal and nuclear units — an acknowledgment that FES’s coal and nuclear plants have lost 88 percent and 90 percent of their value, respectively,” she said. Worse: FirstEnergy seems to agree with much of the IEEFA’s analysis of the company’s difficulties. The analyst community is becoming bearish, too, with Christopher Turnure recently dropping FE’s price target and downgrading the stock to „Neutral” over its exit of the merchant business. Utility stocks are supposed to generate income, not headlines. Don’t risk FirstEnergy going nuclear – get out. FirstEnergy ( FE ) Is an Absolute Dog Macy’s ( M ) Dividend Yield: 6.6% The situation at Macy’s ( M ) is bad. Macy’s shares are off by roughly two-thirds since 2015, because Macy’s operations are in terminal decline. Revenues have dropped for two straight years, income is off roughly 25% since 2013 alone and Macy’s is, ahem, „streamlining” its store portfolio by 100 locations. In other words, these Macy’s locations are performing so poorly, it’s not worth it to keep the lights on anymore. We’re now getting to the point where Macy’s is being pressured to spin off its real estate as a REIT, and buyout rumors are starting to pop up, like the Hudson’s Bay talks that quickly unraveled. That’s great if it happens, but for now, Macy’s has to survive on the merit of its own business, and that business is deteriorating, as Q1’s big earnings and sales misses verified. The clincher? Macy’s, which regularly sends out a press release dedicated to its quarterly dividend – whether it’s ” Macy’s, Inc. Board Declares Quarterly Dividend ” or „Macy’s, Inc. Increases Share Repurchase Authorization by $1.5 Billion, Declares Regular April Dividend and Announces Intent to Increase July Dividend” – did no such thing this quarter. Instead, its dividend declaration was slipped quietly into its first-quarter earnings release. Why? Because Macy’s didn’t want to draw attention to the fact that instead of boosting its dividend like it usually does this time each year, it kept the payout flat at 37.75 cents per share. Dividend growth has stopped. Let’s stop pretending Macy’s is going to turn this around anytime soon. If You’re Not Growing, You’re Dying, And Macy’s ( M ) … Well … Annaly Capital Management (NLY) Dividend Yield: 10.3% What’s not to like about Annaly Capital Management (NLY) ? The mortgage real estate investment trust (mREIT) sports a yield in the double digits, and it’s actually beating the market so far this year with a robust 17% charge higher, putting it at levels last seen in 2014. Well … Annaly’s run now has it trading at a premium to book value, so at the very least, it doesn’t make sense to buy here if you’re a bargain hunter. In fact, its P/B now sits at multiyear highs. But also troubling were recent first-quarter earnings, which weren’t enough to cover its dividend of 30 cents per share. More worrisome is the company’s switch to core EPS, which will provide a more accurate look at how NLY is performing, but also could be more volatile amid interest-rate changes. While last year’s Q4 saw a nice one-time bump, core earnings for Q1 of this year dropped to 29 cents per share – not even enough to cover the 30-cent dividend. Annaly’s fundamental weakness and big year-to-date run are the perfect setup for a summer slump should the market throw a fit. This 10% yielder is a trouble just waiting to happen. Annaly (NLY) Is Hot, But Don’t Get Burned! The Retirement Portfolio You NEVER Have to Touch! What good is a 4%, 7% or even 10% annual dividend yield if you’re racking up similar losses or worse? You need to be averaging roughly 8% in overall annual returns, which means any investments that are treading water or losing ground are literally setting back your retirement timetable, sometimes by entire years! If you want to retire comfortably, you need a multi-tooled portfolio that not only offers big headline yield, but also dividend growth and the potential for capital gains, too! And you can find these kinds of „triple threat” stocks in my „No Withdrawal” retirement portfolio . I’ve spent months researching high-yield stocks looking for the ultimate dividend plays that deliver everything we need to build a successful retirement portfolio. I had to weed out numerous yield traps like some of the losers we mentioned above, but it was worth it, because it resulted in this can’t-miss portfolio featuring: No-doubt 6%, 7% even 8% yields – and in a couple of cases, double-digit dividends! The potential for 7% to 15% in annual capital gains Robust dividend growth that will keep up with (and beat) inflation These are the three most critical elements for any retirement portfolio, because achieving all three allows you to live off income alone while actually growing your nest egg . I shudder when I think of some of the mediocre stocks festering in most retirement portfolios. Yes, no-growth blue chips that yield 3%, maybe 4%, might keep you from losing money, but they’ll also keep your retirement stuck in neutral! Think about it: Even if you’ve saved up $500,000 for retirement, 4% annually is just $20,000 a year. You and I both know that even with Social Security tucked in there, that’s a skimpy retirement. My „No Withdrawal” portfolio averages 8% across the board right now, and offers dividend growth that will result in double-digit „yields on cost” over time. That will ensure you have every cent of income so you can pay the bills and have plenty left over to actually enjoy your retirement years. Meanwhile, the growth potential of these picks will help grow your nest egg, which is essential should you ever need to pay for a big one-time expense, whether it’s an emergency or just buying a vacation home. This all-star portfolio features the absolute best of several high-income assets, from preferred stocks to REITs to closed-end funds and more. That means diversification and continued payouts regardless of how volatile or bearish the stock market becomes. Don’t let mediocre yields from uninspired, lazy stock picks ruin the retirement you’ve worked so hard to build. You deserve substantial, regular dividend checks that will let you see the world and live in comfort for the rest of your post-career life. Let me show you the path to a no-worry retirement. Click here and I’ll provide you with THREE special reports that show you the path to building a „No Withdrawal” portfolio. You’ll get the names, tickers, buy prices and full analysis of their wealth-building potential!

Life Buy/Sell Business Close The Associated Press This Sept. 6, 2012, file photo shows the Amazon logo in Santa Monica, Calif.   (AP Photo/Reed Saxon, File) Amazon’s stock crosses $1,000 mark amid Wall Street love fes Seattle Times 12 hrs ago (…) The Associated Press This Sept. 6, 2012, file photo shows the Amazon logo in Santa Monica, Calif.   (AP Photo/Reed Saxon, File) Updated at 5:30 p.m. SEATTLE • Amazon shares hit $1,000 in early Tuesday trading, reaching a numeric milestone reflecting Wall Street’s strong embrace of the e-commerce giant, something that not long ago, would have been hard to fathom. The ascension to four figures caps a somewhat jittery but ultimately triumphant two-decade run-up that started when the company went public 20 years ago. When accounting for past splits, it marks a staggering 66,567 percent rise in the value of an Amazon share since the 1997 initial public offering — and a 40 percent surge from last year. Amazon’s stock price surged to $1,000.68 in the first-half hour of trading Tuesday. It slipped quickly from that milestone, and though it bounced back near $1,000 at midday, the stock closed the session at $996.70. To be sure, there’s nothing intrinsically magical about a $1,000 share price, even though it’s rare. (According to The Associated Press, only four other U.S.-listed companies have traded above that mark.) It’s due, in part, to Amazon’s reluctance to split its stock in recent years. But the number has other connotations. “Technically, it’s just four digits instead of three,” said Colin Sebastian, an analyst with R.W. Baird. “Symbolically, $1,000 is a demonstration of what Amazon has achieved over the last decade.” That’s especially true for a company that some industry watchers doubted would make it into the mid-2000s. As recently as 2014, Amazon shares were in a relative lull, held back by widespread doubts about the company’s ability to turn a buck as it focused on growing sales.

Compare pay of top St. Louis executives “And here we are, as perhaps one of the most dominant retail and tech companies on the planet,” Sebastian said. Many investors had been frustrated at times by Amazon’s tendency to reinvest its cash into more employees, more warehouses and more experimental businesses. The unpredictability of the company’s quarterly earnings reports (a result, in part, of the vague guidance it gave beforehand) also yielded significant volatility to the stock price. A big shift in investors’ perception of Amazon took place in April 2015, when the company for the first time broke out the financial results of its cloud computing business. Those showed that Amazon Web Services, as the unit is called, had brought home an unexpectedly large $4.6 billion in revenue the previous year, at a profit rate that was much higher than the retail side. Another big shift took place a year ago, when analysts with Bernstein put a $1,000 price target on Amazon shares, which at the time were trading around $680. That was far higher than the street consensus of what Amazon was worth, but the analysts argued that Amazon’s various businesses were so large that it would be hard for the company to keep throwing most of its profits back into investments. Even a $1,000 stock price wouldn’t account in the long term for the value being generated by the giant Seattle company, the analysts concluded.

This is the second refund mailing related to this FTC case. In June 2016, the FTC used the defendants’ sales records to mail full refunds to nearly 200,000 people who bought the products online. When the first checks were mailed, the FTC announced a claims process for people who bought the supplements in retail stores. People who submitted valid claims before the deadline are now receiving full refunds, averaging $49.66 each. Recipients should deposit or cash their checks within 60 days. The FTC’s January 2015 complaint charged Pure Health LLC, Genesis Today, Inc., and their principal, Lindsey Duncan, with deceptively claiming that the supplement would cause people to lose 17 pounds and 16 percent of their body fat in just 12 weeks without diet or exercise, and that the claim was backed up by a clinical study. The FTC’s settlement barred the defendants from making deceptive weight-loss claims about any food or dietary supplement, and required them to pay money for the refund program. Analytics, the refund administrator for this matter, will begin mailing refund checks today. If you have questions, please call 1-844-449-3586.

Especially when a firm’s dividend stream is being eaten alive by Amazon & Co. The Wall Street Journal’s Mark Hulbert studied the „summer rally myth” last year – and concluded it is indeed a good time to sell: „Over the past 60 years, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has produced an average monthly return of just 0.1% during these three summer months, compared with a 0.7% average for all other months.” Worse, even skilled market timers don’t have much to work with. Hulbert found that over the past 60 years, rallies from June’s lows into highs over the next two months averaged 6.9% – the third-lowest such rally potential, behind (you guessed it) July and August. So should we buy these names back in September? For this disastrous four, just sell and stay away. Target ( TGT ) Dividend Yield: 4.3% Big-box retailer Target ( TGT ) has lost roughly a third of its value since 2016, and unfortunately, there’s no single thing to pin it on – and thus no single quick fix. The company is throwing things against the wall to see what will stick, introducing new brands and expanding its small-format stores while trying to squeeze more sales out of its website. But Target still is struggling to get customers through the door – something GlobalData Managing Director Neil Saunders says „is getting worse over time, especially among younger millennial consumers.” Whether Target can do it remains to be seen, but it’s swimming upstream against Amazon.com ( AMZN ) and the growing sprawl of e-commerce, including an increasingly feisty Walmart ( WMT ) . And your reward for holding on while Target tries to successfully execute a turnaround strategy? A risky 4.3%. You can find surer retailers and higher dividend payers. Don’t wait up for Target. Has Target ( TGT ) Peaked? FirstEnergy ( FE ) Dividend Yield: 5.1% When you think utilities, a few words come to mind: „Stability.” „Dividends.” „Bankruptcy” shouldn’t be one of them. That’s a word increasingly being floated about concerning Ohio-based utility FirstEnergy ( FE ) , however, which is among the riskiest plays in the sector right now. Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis report author Cathy Kunkel says that six of FirstEnergy’s coal and nuclear plants are at risk . „In the fourth quarter of 2016, FES took an $8 billion loss to write down the value of its remaining coal and nuclear units — an acknowledgment that FES’s coal and nuclear plants have lost 88 percent and 90 percent of their value, respectively,” she said. Worse: FirstEnergy seems to agree with much of the IEEFA’s analysis of the company’s difficulties. The analyst community is becoming bearish, too, with Christopher Turnure recently dropping FE’s price target and downgrading the stock to „Neutral” over its exit of the merchant business. Utility stocks are supposed to generate income, not headlines. Don’t risk FirstEnergy going nuclear – get out. FirstEnergy ( FE ) Is an Absolute Dog Macy’s ( M ) Dividend Yield: 6.6% The situation at Macy’s ( M ) is bad. Macy’s shares are off by roughly two-thirds since 2015, because Macy’s operations are in terminal decline. Revenues have dropped for two straight years, income is off roughly 25% since 2013 alone and Macy’s is, ahem, „streamlining” its store portfolio by 100 locations. In other words, these Macy’s locations are performing so poorly, it’s not worth it to keep the lights on anymore. We’re now getting to the point where Macy’s is being pressured to spin off its real estate as a REIT, and buyout rumors are starting to pop up, like the Hudson’s Bay talks that quickly unraveled. That’s great if it happens, but for now, Macy’s has to survive on the merit of its own business, and that business is deteriorating, as Q1’s big earnings and sales misses verified. The clincher? Macy’s, which regularly sends out a press release dedicated to its quarterly dividend – whether it’s ” Macy’s, Inc. Board Declares Quarterly Dividend ” or „Macy’s, Inc. Increases Share Repurchase Authorization by $1.5 Billion, Declares Regular April Dividend and Announces Intent to Increase July Dividend” – did no such thing this quarter. Instead, its dividend declaration was slipped quietly into its first-quarter earnings release. Why? Because Macy’s didn’t want to draw attention to the fact that instead of boosting its dividend like it usually does this time each year, it kept the payout flat at 37.75 cents per share. Dividend growth has stopped. Let’s stop pretending Macy’s is going to turn this around anytime soon. If You’re Not Growing, You’re Dying, And Macy’s ( M ) … Well … Annaly Capital Management (NLY) Dividend Yield: 10.3% What’s not to like about Annaly Capital Management (NLY) ? The mortgage real estate investment trust (mREIT) sports a yield in the double digits, and it’s actually beating the market so far this year with a robust 17% charge higher, putting it at levels last seen in 2014. Well … Annaly’s run now has it trading at a premium to book value, so at the very least, it doesn’t make sense to buy here if you’re a bargain hunter. In fact, its P/B now sits at multiyear highs. But also troubling were recent first-quarter earnings, which weren’t enough to cover its dividend of 30 cents per share. More worrisome is the company’s switch to core EPS, which will provide a more accurate look at how NLY is performing, but also could be more volatile amid interest-rate changes. While last year’s Q4 saw a nice one-time bump, core earnings for Q1 of this year dropped to 29 cents per share – not even enough to cover the 30-cent dividend. Annaly’s fundamental weakness and big year-to-date run are the perfect setup for a summer slump should the market throw a fit. This 10% yielder is a trouble just waiting to happen. Annaly (NLY) Is Hot, But Don’t Get Burned! The Retirement Portfolio You NEVER Have to Touch! What good is a 4%, 7% or even 10% annual dividend yield if you’re racking up similar losses or worse? You need to be averaging roughly 8% in overall annual returns, which means any investments that are treading water or losing ground are literally setting back your retirement timetable, sometimes by entire years! If you want to retire comfortably, you need a multi-tooled portfolio that not only offers big headline yield, but also dividend growth and the potential for capital gains, too! And you can find these kinds of „triple threat” stocks in my „No Withdrawal” retirement portfolio . I’ve spent months researching high-yield stocks looking for the ultimate dividend plays that deliver everything we need to build a successful retirement portfolio. I had to weed out numerous yield traps like some of the losers we mentioned above, but it was worth it, because it resulted in this can’t-miss portfolio featuring: No-doubt 6%, 7% even 8% yields – and in a couple of cases, double-digit dividends! The potential for 7% to 15% in annual capital gains Robust dividend growth that will keep up with (and beat) inflation These are the three most critical elements for any retirement portfolio, because achieving all three allows you to live off income alone while actually growing your nest egg . I shudder when I think of some of the mediocre stocks festering in most retirement portfolios. Yes, no-growth blue chips that yield 3%, maybe 4%, might keep you from losing money, but they’ll also keep your retirement stuck in neutral! Think about it: Even if you’ve saved up $500,000 for retirement, 4% annually is just $20,000 a year. You and I both know that even with Social Security tucked in there, that’s a skimpy retirement. My „No Withdrawal” portfolio averages 8% across the board right now, and offers dividend growth that will result in double-digit „yields on cost” over time. That will ensure you have every cent of income so you can pay the bills and have plenty left over to actually enjoy your retirement years. Meanwhile, the growth potential of these picks will help grow your nest egg, which is essential should you ever need to pay for a big one-time expense, whether it’s an emergency or just buying a vacation home. This all-star portfolio features the absolute best of several high-income assets, from preferred stocks to REITs to closed-end funds and more. That means diversification and continued payouts regardless of how volatile or bearish the stock market becomes. Don’t let mediocre yields from uninspired, lazy stock picks ruin the retirement you’ve worked so hard to build. You deserve substantial, regular dividend checks that will let you see the world and live in comfort for the rest of your post-career life. Let me show you the path to a no-worry retirement. Click here and I’ll provide you with THREE special reports that show you the path to building a „No Withdrawal” portfolio. You’ll get the names, tickers, buy prices and full analysis of their wealth-building potential!

(NYSE: BRK.A) doesn't pay a dividend, but the company and the stock both benefit greatly from owning shares of some of the best dividend aristocrats on the market. CEO Warren Buffett has told investors about the power of compounding interest for decades and referenced it in a 1964 letter to his partners. At the time, he said an investment may start off paying just a few percentage points. For example, PepsiCo Inc. (NYSE: PEP) pays a dividend of $0.81 per share, which is a yield of 2.81%. If you bought $10,000 shares of PEP on May 1, 2016, and reinvested the dividends through a dividend reinvestment program (DRIP), your shares would have been worth $11,172 on May 1, 2017. What Is a Dividend Aristocrat? Dividend aristocrats are companies that have increased their dividend payments for 25 consecutive years. Some of the most well-known dividend aristocrats include: Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE: XOM) pays a dividend of $0.77, which is a yield of 3.75%. Aflac Inc. (NYSE: AFL) pays a dividend of $0.43, which is a yield of 2.32%. AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T) pays a dividend of $0.49, which is a yield of 5.12%. T-Rowe Price Group Inc. (Nasdaq: TROW) pays a dividend of $0.57, which is a yield of 3.27%. Clorox Co. (NYSE: CLX) pays a dividend of $0.84, which is a yield of 2.50%. If you just kept the dividends, your investment would be worth $11,147. That's a difference of only $25. So it may not seem like a big deal at first glance. However, Buffett said in that 1964 letter that the power of compounding interest "mushrooms" over time. According to its website, Pepsi first paid a dividend on Feb. 1, 2001. If you invested $10,000 and reinvested the dividends since then, your shares would have been worth $34,390 on Feb. 1, 2017, according to DividendChannel.com. That's an annual average return of 8.02%. In comparison, an index fund that tracked the S&P 500 would have made just $22,007, for an average annual return of just 5.05%. So you'd have an extra $12,383 in your pocket just from sitting by and having your dividends automatically reinvested for you. Trending Story: The 7 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy in 2017 Best of all, this is a passive investment strategy that doesn't involve timing the market or making risky decisions. And because compounding interest is so powerful, I wanted to dig through Buffett's portfolio of dividend stocks, especially the dividend aristocrats. I wanted Money Morning readers to know exactly what's in Buffett's portfolio. Buffett currently has four dividend aristocrats in his portfolio, and one stands out above the rest. Here are the four dividend aristocrats in Buffet's portfolio, including the best of the bunch… Dividend Aristocrat No. 4: The Coca-Cola Co. According to Fortune, Buffett drinks five 12-ounce cans of Coke a day. He likes the company so much that The Coca-Cola Co. (NYSE: KO) is Berkshire's 12th-largest holding. According to its website, Coke has paid a quarterly dividend since 1920 and has increased dividend payments in each of the last 55 years. Today, KO pays shareholders a dividend of $0.37, for a yield of 3.29%. The billionaire zeroed in on KO stock because of its strong business and because of the 1987 stock market crash. Coca-Cola is and was the most well-known soda maker, and Buffett believed the stock was being undervalued at the time. According to Investopedia.com, Buffett purchased more than $1 billion of Coca-Cola stock in 1988, which made him a 6.2% owner of the company. In the beginning of that year, KO shares opened at $2.39 on Jan. 4, 1998. Video U.S. Becoming Warren Buffett On May 24, 2017, shares of KO opened at $44.51. That's an increase of 1,762% in 29 years. Now, Buffett has a 9.32% stake in the company, and his shares of KO are worth $2.2 billion. Dividend Aristocrat No. 3: Procter & Gamble Co. Buffett owned roughly $4 billion in Procter & Gamble Co. (NYSE: PG) in May 2016, although his stake in the company was not through direct stock purchases. In 1989, Buffett invested $600 million in razor-blade giant Gillette, which gave Berkshire an 11% stake in the company. Like Coca-Cola, razor blades are a product consumers buy no matter what is happening with the company or the market. Sales will always be steady, and this fits Buffett's strategy of investing in what he understands. However, this was an even more profitable investment than Buffett could have originally imagined. Procter & Gamble announced in January 2005 that it would acquire Gillette, which valued Buffett's shares at roughly $5 billion. At the time, the PG stock price was trading at $54.50 per share. On May 24, 2017, the PG stock price opened at $86.45. In 12 years, that's a small increase of 58.62%. However, the dividend has drastically increased since Procter first paid shareholders $0.05 per share in 1990. Today, PG pays a dividend of $0.69, which is a yield of 3.19%. That's an increase of 1,280% over 27 years. He then exchanged most of his PG shares in 2014 when it was trading for roughly $90 per share for ownership of Procter's Duracell battery division. As of Q1 2017, Berkshire has $27.1 million worth of PG stock in its portfolio. Dividend Aristocrat No. 2: Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Buffett first bought shares of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE: WMT) in 2005. WMT shares traded at roughly $50 per share at the time. Today, Wal-Mart stock trades for $78.56 per share, which is a small increase of 57.12%. But the real wealth builder from WMT stock has been the annual increase in its dividend payout. If you purchased $10,000 worth of WMT stock in 1995, reinvested the dividend, and sold it 20 years later, your WMT shares would be worth $86,437. In comparison, an investment in a fund that tracks the S&P 500 would be worth $50,395, according to DividendChannel.com. Again, that's an extra $36,042 in your pocket with almost no upfront work at all. The WMT dividend payout has increased annually every year since it first paid $0.05 per share in March 1974. Today, the retailer pays $0.51 per share, which is a yield of 2.61%. That's a 920% increase over 43 years. But the dividend payout wasn't good enough to keep Buffett around… According to Fortune, Buffett's shares of WMT were worth $3 billion in the summer of 2016, and Berkshire sold most of its shares in Q4 2016. The company unloaded almost $900 million worth of WMT and now holds just $109.5 million. The reason? Buffett saw the shift in how consumers buy products, using online platforms instead of shopping in stores. At Berkshire's annual meeting in 2016, he reportedly said Amazon.com Inc. (Nasdaq: AMZN) is a "big force" and that other companies have not figured out how to counter or effectively participate in online selling. Buffett's sell-off of WMT shows even if a company pays a dividend, the stock isn't always worth owning. However, we do have a new profit opportunity from one dividend aristocrat in Buffett's portfolio. And according Money Morning Director of Tech & Venture Capital Research Michael A. Robinson, this dividend-paying stock should be a foundational holding for our readers… Join the conversation.

Brian McGairty, on May 30 at approximately 4:30 a.m., four men entered Walmart in Pearl and went to the electronics department. They went behind the glass container that holds electronics like tablets and cellphones. An employee saw them behind the counter and asked what they were doing. The men displayed hammers and threatened the employee that they would hit her if she came closer. The men broke the glass container with their hammers and stole cell phones and tablets before running out the back of the building.  The four were seen leaving the scene in a silver Chrysler 300 with no tag.  The case is being investigated as an armed robbery.  Additional information will be made available as the case unfolds. Hopefully surveillance and images will be out later today.  Copyright 2017 MSNewsNow. All rights reserved.

Amazon's market capitalisation stood at about $478 billion, more than twice that of Wal-Mart Stores. After going in public in May 1997 at $18 a share, Amazon has benefited from tectonic shifts in US technology and consumer shopping habits that are expected to continue to remake the retail industry.  The company has evolved from its origins as an online bookseller into a broad-based retailer of apparel and household staples, from electronics to sausage casing.  With its "Prime" subscription service, it also has become a creative force in Hollywood and beyond.  Amazon shares have appreciated especially rapidly over the last three years in anticipation that e-commerce will become a much bigger force in the retail sector.   Online sales currently comprise about 8% of the US retail market. Amazon alone accounts for about 43% of US online sales, according to consultancy Slice Intelligence.  E-commerce is expected to grow between 8-12% this year, according to the National Retail Federation, about three times as much as the rest of the industry, which has faced massive store and mall closures.  Amazon, whose revenues grew to $35.7 billion in the first quarter, also has impressed Wall Street by laying out a plan to achieve greater profitability.  It is in the process of investing $1.5 billion to establish its own delivery network and lessen its dependence on shipping giants FedEx and UPS.  That will help contain delivery costs, which grew 30% to $1.9 billion in the first quarter. The surge above $1,000 a share also raises questions about whether Amazon intends to pursue a stock split.  At Amazon's annual meeting a week ago, chief executive Jeff Bezos said the matter was under consideration. The company had three previous stock splits, in June 1998 and in January and August 1999. Amazon currently is the fourth biggest company by market capitalisation after Apple, Google's parent Alphabet and Microsoft.   More on News Business Business Technology Science and Technology amazon shares Most Read 1Govt to sell 25% of AIB shares, Noonan confirms23:48 2Ireland can expect 'meaningful share' of Brexit moves18:35 3British Airways left to count cost of IT meltdown18:21 4Unemployment rate steady at 6.4%12:59 5Ryanair warns of Brexit risk despite 6% profit growth18:12 More for you.

Amazon, the e-commerce giant that changed how people shop for books, toilet paper and TVs, hit a new milestone Tuesday, May 30: Its stock topped $1,000 for the first time. (AP Photo/Mary Altaffer) NEW YORK (AP) — Amazon, the internet goliath that revolutionized the way much of the world buys books, toilet paper and TVs, hit a new milestone Tuesday. Its stock surpassed the $1,000 mark for the first time. That price put Amazon's market value at about $478 billion, double that of the world's biggest traditional retailer, Wal-Mart, and more than 15 times the size of Target. A $1,000 investment on Amazon's first day of trading in 1997 would be worth more than $500,000 today. Not only has Amazon changed the retail landscape since it became a public company 20 years ago, it's now part of a small cadre of high-flying stocks belonging to companies that have defied Wall Street and shunned stock splits. Those splits make the stock more affordable and generate brokerage fees. But companies like Amazon have chosen to reward its long-term investors. The last time Amazon has split its stock was nearly 18 years ago, according to financial research firm FactSet. Another company with a similar philosophy is Alphabet Inc., the parent company of Google. Amazon just beat Alphabet to the $1,000 level, with its Class A shares just $2 short of $1,000 Tuesday. Only four other U.S.-listed companies have shares trading above $1,000: online travel booking company Priceline Group Inc., homebuilder NVR Inc., pork producer and ocean transportation company Seaboard Corp. and the apostle of long-term investing, Warren Buffett, with his holding company Berkshire Hathaway Inc. But stock prices only tell a part of the story. The value of a company is determined by its stock price and the number of shares on the market. Amazon.com is well over four times the size of Priceline, NVR and Seaboard combined. It's 17 percent bigger than Berkshire Hathaway, a multinational conglomerate with ownership stakes in some of America's most well-known consumer brands like Coca-Cola, insurance companies and U.S. infrastructure. Since launching a website to sell mostly books in 1995, Amazon has transfigured retail, sent revenue numbers to stratospheric heights, and is among the biggest reasons longtime powerhouses like Macy's, Borders bookstores and even RadioShack have suffered.

By Jeffrey Gracer, opinion contributor - 05/30/17 11:00 AM EDT 9   © Thinkstock As a revanchist attack against environmental regulation unfolds in Washington cloaked in pro-business rhetoric, a pragmatic forward-looking revolution is taking place in financial centers and corporate boardrooms around the country, supported by leadership from state and local governments. These businesses and governments know that a dystopian future driven by unchecked greenhouse gas emissions will not be good for anyone — including business. They also know that deep decarbonization is not only possible but economically beneficial. Jobs are being created and profits are being made driving innovation toward a more sustainable future. ADVERTISEMENT As former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg writes in “Climate of Hope,” the evidence that this can be done is all around us and is continuing to multiply. Now more than ever, many in the private sector are defending these principles and driving them forward with a new sense of urgency.   Just as corporations learned decades ago that they could increase profits by reverse engineering their operations to minimize discharges of conventional pollution, businesses today are learning they can operate more profitably by reducing their carbon footprints. Companies like Anheiser Bush InBev and General Motors are saving tens of millions of dollars participating in the renewable energy (RE100) program established by The Climate Group and CDP. Walmart has proved that rooftop solar projects can be installed at scale, reducing energy costs and providing a healthy return on investment. Google is creating demand for wind and other sustainable energy projects to power their business operations and reduce costs. GE is replacing certain conventional vehicles with electric vehicles, demonstrating that lower maintenance requirements and fuel savings make these fleets highly cost-effective. Unilever is working with suppliers to source sustainably harvested products. States like California, Massachusetts and New York, and cities like San Francisco, Chicago and New York, are partnering with businesses to create new low carbon opportunities. These combined efforts are creating hundreds of thousands of high-paying jobs in agriculture, wind and solar, energy efficiency and other sectors. Many of these transformations are being fueled by a generational shift that began in the 1970s and is now in full expression. Baby boomers who grew up during an era of increased environmental awareness are today’s CEOs, CFOs and board members. The younger generations that came after them are taking environmental awareness to a new level, creating a broad and deep movement of newly-minted socially conscious innovators within the corporate world. The best and brightest graduates want to use their talents to create more responsible business practices and drive sustainable profits. They are bringing an impressive array of financial, technical and organizational skill to the table. This shift in the corporate world was visible in the climate change negotiations that culminated in the Paris Agreement. Many corporations played a constructive and critical role in support of that effort. And after the election, those same entities have been outspoken in their support of the agreement. In a time where so much seems uncertain, one can find reason for hope in these developments. With or without Washington, the work being undertaken by many members of the private sector and state and local governments will continue. Indeed, that work is likely to intensify as companies and state and local governments resist policies and regulations that would undermine their efforts. Many understandably lament the death of bipartisan support in Washington for sensible environmental regulation, including the abandonment of support for market-based mechanisms to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. But it would be wise for politicians in Washington to take note of what is happening outside of the District, where there is much greater consensus. An increasingly vocal majority of Americans of both political parties want environmental protections to endure, including many within the business community. There is surprisingly broad and deep bipartisan support for these principles. Many are prepared to defend a future for all Americans that includes protection of human health and the environment. Companies are prepared to make the case that a decarbonized economy makes good business sense. Concerned Americans are committed to doing the work necessary to achieve the transformation that will be required to get there. As the Financial Times recently reported, this “Big Green Bang” is proving so profitable that it is unstoppable. There is reason to be hopeful that broad support for a decarbonized future will continue to grow as evidence pours in showing that companies can profit while reducing pollution. But we are running out of time. Now is the moment for cost-effective solutions to be scaled up and for increased engagement by the business community, in partnership with state and local governments. The question for Washington is why it would not also support this pro-business agenda.

The shares touched $1,001.2 at one point on Tuesday before slipping back to $996.7. It originally listed its shares in May 1997 for just $18 each. Amazon now has a market capitalisation of about $478bn, which is more than twice that of Wal-Mart. After starting as a bookseller, it has steadily expanded to become much broader-based retailer. According to consultancy Slice Intelligence, Amazon now accounts for about 43% of all online sales in the US. Amazon is now the fourth-largest US company by market capitalisation, behind Apple, Google owner Alphabet, and Microsoft. Alphabet's class A shares were also close to hitting four figures on Tuesday, trading at $996, meaning the company is worth around $681bn. Despite the rise in Amazon's share price, the Nasdaq index - of which Amazon is a member - closed down 7 points or 0.11% at 6,203.19. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 50.81 points to 21,029.47 while the wider S&P 500 index slid 2.91 points to 2,412.91 as investors picked their way through a raft of US economic data. Figures from the Commerce Department showed that consumer spending posted its biggest rise for four months in April, climbing 0.4%. That followed an upwardly revised 0.3% increase in March. Separate data showed the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose by 0.2% in April, following a 0.2% fall in March. Prices in April were up 1.7% from a year earlier, although that was down from March's figure of 1.9%. The so-called core PCE price index - which strips out food and energy prices, and is the Federal Reserve's favoured inflation measure - showed a 1.5% annual rise, compared with a 1.6% increase in March. The Fed targets a rate of 2% for the core PCE index. Many analysts expect that the US central bank will raise interest rates when it meets next month.

Only one other stock in the S&P 500 — Priceline — has a stock price in the quadruple digits. Google parent Alphabet is also rapidly approaching this rarefied air. Its stock was trading at about $993. Amazon stock, which hit a new high of $1,001.20 before pulling back a bit, is now up nearly 35% this year. The company’s market value is a staggering $478 billion, twice that of Walmart and trailing only Apple, Alphabet and Microsoft. Amazon to build homeless shelter in new Seattle HQ And Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos is worth about $85 billion, according to Forbes and Bloomberg. That makes him richer than Warren Buffett and in a virtual tie with Spanish retail mogul Amancio Ortega in a tie for second richest person on the planet. Both Bezos and Ortega trail Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates by about $3 billion. Amazon’s stock has soared thanks to strong results from its core retail business. It’s even been opening physical stores, including a new one in Manhattan last week. Advertisement The company also has a booming cloud computing business and has started to make bigger moves into media and advertising as well. As for Alphabet, its stock is up more than 25% this year. That’s largely due to the continued dominance of its search engine — and the ad dollars that come with that. But YouTube and Android are also generating more sales and profits for the company. Alphabet also has several so-called “other bets” — companies like driverless car tech firm Waymo, Fiber and connected device maker Nest — that are also starting to kick in more revenue. Advertisement But how significant is it really that Amazon’s stock is now above $1,000? It’s really just a psychological milestone. Most professional investors don’t look at just the stock price. They compare the price to the company’s projected earnings. And on that basis, Amazon is pretty expensive. It’s trading at about 90 times earnings estimates for next year, much higher than the overall market as well as other tech titans like Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft and Facebook. The main reason that Amazon’s share price has gotten to this level is that the company has not done a stock split since 1999. When a company splits its stock, it issues more shares to existing investors. That lowers the price of each share but doesn’t change the value of that person’s investment — or the entire company. For example, if you owned 100 shares of a stock trading at $100 and the company decided to split its stock 2 for 1, you’d wind up with 200 shares at a price of $50 each. Advertisement But investors (and financial reporters) love to focus on big round numbers. They are a lot easier to comprehend. Still, Amazon’s and Alphabet’s stock prices are important for another reason. If either company ever hope to be added to the illustrious Dow Jones Industrial Average, they will need to split their stock first. That’s because the Dow is a price-weighted average and not a market cap-weighted index like the S&P 500. Adding a stock with a price north of $1,000 would give that company an outsized influence on the Dow’s daily moves. Investment bank Goldman Sachs has the highest stock price in the Dow right now. But it’s only about $220. Thirteen other Dow stocks have a price above $100, including Apple — which trades at about $154. But Apple wasn’t added to the Dow until 2015, a few months after the company did a 7 for 1 stock split that lowered its price from near $650 to about $92. 40.712784 -74.005941 Related Stories Facebook misled European officials over WhatsApp deal Net neutrality protesters ‘rickroll’ Trump’s FCC chairman Authors: CNN Wire Filed in: National/World News Topics: $1000, Alphabet, Amazon, Google, Stock, Stock Market, Valuation 590 Suggest a correction × Suggest A Correction Your name Your email Report a typo or grammatical error Cancel More in National/World News World War II vet gets high school diploma after 71 years More from WGNO Mobile Apps Android App iPhone & iPad App facebook twitter instagram pinterest Email Alerts About & Contact Screenertv Screener Untitled-2Covers Online Public File • EEO Report • Terms of Service • Privacy Policy • 1 Galleria Blvd., Suite 850 Metairie, LA 70001 • Copyright © 2017, WGNO • A Tribune Broadcasting Station • Powered by WordPress.com VIP × Email Alerts Send to Email Address Your Name Your Email Address Cancel Post was not sent - check your email addresses!

By Ron Dicker 340 A woman was charged with child abuse after she allegedly shut her kids in the trunk of her car Thursday while she shopped at a Walmart in Riverdale, Utah, the Deseret News reported. Tori Castillo, 39, faces four counts of child abuse, according to a Weber County Sheriff’s inmate roster. She was still in jail Tuesday morning and is to be arraigned today, a spokeswoman for the sheriff’s office told HuffPost. The children, ages 2 and 5, are safe, thanks to alert passersby. As the children screamed and shook the car from the inside, one witness called police while others responded as well. “Several good Samaritans observed this and came to the aid of the children,” Riverdale police Lt. Casey Warren told the newspaper. One of the witnesses, identified only as Heidi, told Salt Lake City’s Fox 13 she could hear a little girl yelling for her mother to let her out. She said she instructed the child to open the emergency latch and out popped two kids like they were “spring-loaded,” she told the television station. While Heidi and a friend waited for police to arrive, the mother appeared. “The only explanation she had was, ‘My babysitter didn’t show up,’” Heidi said. The children were released to their father, the local ABC affiliate, Good4Utah, reported. The Department of Child and Family Services is investigating, along with police.   ALSO ON HUFFPOST 10 Major Crimes That Shocked the Nation (SLIDESHOW) 10 Major Crimes That Shocked the Nation (SLIDESHOW) 10 Major Crimes That Shocked the Nation (SLIDESHOW) 1 of 10 "Young L.A.

What made this discovery the stuff of tabloid sensation, however, was the Glasgow smile left on the aspiring actress' face--made with 3-inch slashes on each side. This, coupled with Short's dark hair, fair complexion and reputation for sporting a dahlia in her hair, dubbed her "The Black Dahlia" in headlines. What followed was a media circus filled with rumors and speculation about the promiscuous 22-year-old's checkered past. What haunts theorists to this day, apart from the victim's uniquely nightmarish visage, is that the case remains unsolved after some 200 suspects were interviewed and ultimately released--making it one of Hollywood's most lurid legends.

The e-commerce giant, by selling almost anything possible, from books to electronics, has managed to make even established retailers like Walmart to adapt to the changing trends in how people prefer to shop today. By: FE Online | Updated: May 30, 2017 8:05 PM This price of $ 1,000 puts Amazon’s market value at $ 478 billion. It is twice that of Wal-Mart and over 15 times the size of another competitor, Target. (Reuters) Amazon the biggest online retailer hit the $1000 mark on Tuesday. The e-commerce giant, by selling almost anything possible, from books to electronics, has managed to make even established retailers like Walmart to adapt to the changing trends in how people prefer to shop today. With the new milestone, Amazon shares have risen by 40 percent in the past year. The e-tailing giant’s stock topped $1,000 for the first time ever. An Associated Press report says that this price puts Amazon’s market value at $478 billion. This number is twice that of Wal-Mart and over 15 times the size of another competitor, Target. The report added that its 4-digit stock price places the company in the rare company of just four other US-listed companies which trade above $1,000. Based on its cloud computing businesses called Amazon Web Services, Amazon has now turned a profit for 8 quarters consecutively. Amazon had topped the estimates in April. A report in Associated Press said that the company had posted revenue of $35.7 billion and earnings per share of $1.48. That is when the stock went on an upward trend. Amazon had said that sales rose a 23 percent during that quarter and that its Amazon Web Services business sales rose by a whopping 42 percent. Meanwhile, rival technology giant Alphabet is not too far behind. According to the company, shares of its Class A stock are trading above $990, as of now. Amazon.com, when it launched in 1995, used to mainly sell books. It has come a long way from there. The Seattle-based online giant now sells anything and everything under the sun. It has also been accused of taking away market shares from department stores, supermarkets and clothing retailers, and it is visible from where even a big firm like WalMart stands. Amazon’s shares had gone public in the year 1997. It was a time when there was no certainties profitability, and its rivals like Barnes & Noble, being more than a century old was threatening its businesses.

It's trading at about 90 times earnings estimates for next year, much higher than the overall market as well as other tech titans like Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft and Facebook. The main reason that Amazon's share price has gotten to this level is that the company has not done a stock split since 1999. When a company splits its stock, it issues more shares to existing investors. That lowers the price of each share but doesn't change the value of that person's investment -- or the entire company. For example, if you owned 100 shares of a stock trading at $100 and the company decided to split its stock 2 for 1, you'd wind up with 200 shares at a price of $50 each. But investors (and financial reporters) love to focus on big round numbers. They are a lot easier to comprehend. Still, Amazon's and Alphabet's stock prices are important for another reason. If either company ever hope to be added to the illustrious Dow Jones Industrial Average, they will need to split their stock first. That's because the Dow is a price-weighted average and not a market cap-weighted index like the S&P 500. Adding a stock with a price north of $1,000 would give that company an outsized influence on the Dow's daily moves. Investment bank Goldman Sachs has the highest stock price in the Dow right now. But it's only about $220. Thirteen other Dow stocks have a price above $100, including Apple -- which trades at about $154. But Apple wasn't added to the Dow until 2015, a few months after the company did a 7 for 1 stock split that lowered its price from near $650 to about $92.

Tori Castillo, 39, of Riverdale, Utah in the USA, allegedly put her two children, aged two and five, in the boot while she visited her local Wal-Mart. The Mirror reports that an eyewitness saw the vehicle "moving frantically, causing the vehicle to shake" before "several good Samaritans observed this and came to the aid of the children". Castillo was arrested upon her return to the vehicle and booked into Weber County Jail for investigation into child abuse. Riverdale City Police officer Casey Warren told KTVX: "It's never right to lock a child inside of a vehicle, let alone a trunk of a vehicle. Obviously there are a lot of things that could go wrong." Charity Maw, who witnessed the events unfolding and heard the children in the boot, spoke to CNN. She said: "I was shocked, I was shaken, and I was mad. "And there are two kids there, tears coming down their face. Bawling. They were scared."

Its stock topped $1,000 for the first time. (Photo: Loic Venance / Getty Images) 5 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE New York — Amazon, the internet goliath that revolutionized the way much of the world shops for books, toilet paper and TVs, hit a new milestone Tuesday. Its stock surpassed the $1,000 mark for the first time. That price put Amazon’s market value at about $478 billion, double that of the world’s biggest traditional retailer, Wal-Mart, and more than 15 times the size of Target. Not only has Amazon changed the retail landscape since it became a public company 20 years ago, it’s now part of a small cadre of high-flying stocks belonging to companies that have defied Wall Street and shunned stock splits. Those splits make the stock more affordable and generate brokerage fees. But companies like Amazon have chosen to reward its long-term investors. The last time Amazon has split its stock was nearly 18 years ago, according to financial research firm FactSet. Another company with a similar philosophy is Alphabet Inc., the parent company of Google. Amazon just beat Alphabet to the $1,000 level, with its Class A shares just $2 short of $1,000 Tuesday. Four other U.S.-listed companies have shares trading at similar levels: online travel booking company Priceline Group Inc., homebuilder NVR Inc., pork producer and ocean transportation company Seaboard Corp. and the apostle of long-term investing, Warren Buffett, with his holding company Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Since launching a website to sell mostly books in 1995, Amazon has transfigured retail, sent revenue numbers to stratospheric heights, and is among the biggest reasons longtime powerhouses like Macy’s, Borders bookstores and even RadioShack have suffered. Those companies are closing locations and Amazon is filling the void, sometimes literally. Last week in a location once occupied by Borders, which went out of business in 2011, Amazon opened its first store in New York City. 5 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Shares of the online retail giant hit a new record high above $1,000 Tuesday. It's an impressive feat. Only one other stock in the S&P 500 -- Priceline -- has a stock price in the quadruple digits. Google parent Alphabet is also rapidly approaching this rarefied air. Its stock was trading at about $993. Amazon stock, which hit a new high of $1,001.20 before pulling back a bit, is now up nearly 35% this year. The company's market value is a staggering $478 billion, twice that of Walmart and trailing only Apple, Alphabet and Microsoft. And Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos is worth about $85 billion, according to Forbes and Bloomberg. That makes him richer than Warren Buffett and in a virtual tie with Spanish retail mogul Amancio Ortega in a tie for second richest person on the planet. Both Bezos and Ortega trail Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates by about $3 billion. Amazon's stock has soared thanks to strong results from its core retail business. It's even been opening physical stores, including a new one in Manhattan last week. The company also has a booming cloud computing business and has started to make bigger moves into media and advertising as well. As for Alphabet, its stock is up more than 25% this year. That's largely due to the continued dominance of its search engine -- and the ad dollars that come with that. But YouTube and Android are also generating more sales and profits for the company. Alphabet also has several so-called "other bets" -- companies like driverless car tech firm Waymo, Fiber and connected device maker Nest -- that are also starting to kick in more revenue. But how significant is it really that Amazon's stock is now above $1,000? It's really just a psychological milestone. Most professional investors don't look at just the stock price. They compare the price to the company's projected earnings. And on that basis, Amazon is pretty expensive. It's trading at about 90 times earnings estimates for next year, much higher than the overall market as well as other tech titans like Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft and Facebook. The main reason that Amazon's share price has gotten to this level is that the company has not done a stock split since 1999. When a company splits its stock, it issues more shares to existing investors. That lowers the price of each share but doesn't change the value of that person's investment -- or the entire company. For example, if you owned 100 shares of a stock trading at $100 and the company decided to split its stock 2 for 1, you'd wind up with 200 shares at a price of $50 each. But investors (and financial reporters) love to focus on big round numbers. They are a lot easier to comprehend. Still, Amazon's and Alphabet's stock prices are important for another reason. If either company ever hope to be added to the illustrious Dow Jones Industrial Average, they will need to split their stock first. That's because the Dow is a price-weighted average and not a market cap-weighted index like the S&P 500. Adding a stock with a price north of $1,000 would give that company an outsized influence on the Dow's daily moves. Investment bank Goldman Sachs has the highest stock price in the Dow right now. But it's only about $220. Thirteen other Dow stocks have a price above $100, including Apple -- which trades at about $154. But Apple wasn't added to the Dow until 2015, a few months after the company did a 7 for 1 stock split that lowered its price from near $650 to about $92.   Copyright 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Its stock surpassed the $1,000 mark for the first time. That price put Amazon's market value at about $478 billion, double that of the world's biggest traditional retailer, Wal-Mart, and more than 15 times the size of Target. A $1,000 investment on Amazon's first day of trading in 1997 would be worth more than $500,000 today. Not only has Amazon changed the retail landscape since it became a public company 20 years ago, it's now part of a small cadre of high-flying stocks belonging to companies that have defied Wall Street and shunned stock splits. Those splits make the stock more affordable and generate brokerage fees. But companies like Amazon have chosen to reward its long-term investors. The last time Amazon has split its stock was nearly 18 years ago, according to financial research firm FactSet. Another company with a similar philosophy is Alphabet Inc., the parent company of Google. Amazon just beat Alphabet to the $1,000 level, with its Class A shares just $2 short of $1,000 Tuesday. Only four other U.S.-listed companies have shares trading above $1,000: online travel booking company Priceline Group Inc., homebuilder NVR Inc., pork producer and ocean transportation company Seaboard Corp. and the apostle of long-term investing, Warren Buffett, with his holding company Berkshire Hathaway Inc. But stock prices only tell a part of the story. The value of a company is determined by its stock price and the number of shares on the market. Amazon.com is well over four times the size of Priceline, NVR and Seaboard combined. It's 17 percent bigger than Berkshire Hathaway, a multinational conglomerate with ownership stakes in some of America's most well-known consumer brands like Coca-Cola, insurance companies and U.S. infrastructure. Since launching a website to sell mostly books in 1995, Amazon has transfigured retail, sent revenue numbers to stratospheric heights, and is among the biggest reasons longtime powerhouses like Macy's, Borders bookstores and even RadioShack have suffered. Those companies are closing locations and Amazon is filling the void, sometimes literally. Last week in a location once occupied by Borders, the bookstore chain that went out of business in 2011, Amazon opened its first bookstore in New York City. _____ Contact Joseph Pisani at http://twitter.com/josephpisani Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Shares of the online retail giant hit a new record high above $1,000 Tuesday. It’s an impressive feat. Only one other stock in the S&P 500 — Priceline — has a stock price in the quadruple digits. Google parent Alphabet is also rapidly approaching this rarefied air. Its stock was trading at about $993. Amazon stock, which hit a new high of $1,001.20 before pulling back a bit, is now up nearly 35% this year. The company’s market value is a staggering $478 billion, twice that of Walmart and trailing only Apple, Alphabet and Microsoft. And Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos is worth about $85 billion, according to Forbes and Bloomberg. That makes him richer than Warren Buffett and in a virtual tie with Spanish retail mogul Amancio Ortega in a tie for second richest person on the planet. Both Bezos and Ortega trail Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates by about $3 billion. Amazon’s stock has soared thanks to strong results from its core retail business. It’s even been opening physical stores, including a new one in Manhattan last week. The company also has a booming cloud computing business and has started to make bigger moves into media and advertising as well. As for Alphabet, its stock is up more than 25% this year. That’s largely due to the continued dominance of its search engine — and the ad dollars that come with that. But YouTube and Android are also generating more sales and profits for the company. Alphabet also has several so-called “other bets” — companies like driverless car tech firm Waymo, Fiber and connected device maker Nest — that are also starting to kick in more revenue. But how significant is it really that Amazon’s stock is now above $1,000? It’s really just a psychological milestone. Most professional investors don’t look at just the stock price.

Leaders representing a corporate purchaser, deregulated utility, a public utility commissioner, and a wind developer, discussed a few of those trends - demand from diverse customers, transmission expansion, falling costs, and storytelling - on the closing General Session panel as the WINDPOWER 2017 Conference wrapped up this week in Anaheim. There are many customers for wind energy, including utilities, Fortune 500 brands, cities, and universities. Demand is strong because low, stable prices for wind help these companies and organizations improve their bottom line while also helping them reach sustainability targets. "If you look at our panel, you have a developer, a utility, a regulator, and a corporate purchaser," said Rob Threlkeld, Global Manager, Renewable Energy, for General Motors. "There's your message. We're at the point where wind and solar have become mainstream technology." General Motors has signed several long term contracts for wind energy, including to supply an assembly plant in Arlington, Texas, that makes 1,000 SUVs a day. The company has also committed to RE100, to source all of their global electric power from renewable sources by 2050. GM isn't alone, other Fortune 500 brands including Amazon, Microsoft, and Walmart have all purchased wind energy. Threlkeld added, "Look at GM's supply chain. How many thousands of suppliers we have that are interested in renewable energy as well." "By continuing to get cost competitive, continuing to improve the wind energy product - it's already great - you'll capture a lot of potential customers out there, not only public utilities and corporate purchasers, but municipal utilities, rural co-ops, and other entities," said Buzz Miller, President and CEO, Southern Power, a deregulated utility and power producer. Miller added, "Whether it's electric vehicles or renewables, what customers want will ultimately drive it." Expanding and upgrading our nation's vital electric transmission infrastructure can help connect world-class U.S. wind resources to load centers like cities and factories. That will help save consumers money and boost the reliability and resiliency of the U.S. electricity supply. "Wind can stay attractive. You fix some of the transmission issues around, keep vibrant, and we can get through that [the PTC phase out]," said Miller. Wind power has grown rapidly over the last few years. Rapidly changing technology and falling costs have resulted in wind supplying over 5 percent of U.S. electricity, and more than 20 percent of electricity in five states. Wind power also supports over 100,000 American jobs. Telling the story - how wind works for America - is more important than ever. "We have massive room to grow in telling the story of wind power," said Miller. "One of the greatest infrastructure successes is tied to the wind energy PTC, thousands of megawatts, billions of dollars of investment, and the jobs that go with it." AWEA CEO Tom Kiernan in his remarks and columns this week in trade media described 16 trends that will continue to buoy the industry beyond 2020, once the wind energy Production Tax Credit (PTC) completes its current phase out. They include the falling cost of wind energy, expanding state policies like California's, and upgrades to the nation's power grid and transmission infrastructure. WINDPOWER 2018 heads to Chicago As thousands of attendees head home from Anaheim, show organizers reflected on success this year while looking ahead to WINDPOWER 2018, May 7-10 in Chicago. "WINDPOWER in Anaheim brought more action than ever to the show floor," said Jana Adams, AWEA Senior Vice President of Membership Value and Experience. "From the design of our exhibit space, to the broadcasting of our general sessions, and spotlight on new exhibitors, we're maximizing opportunities to make connections and ink new deals." Attendee Neal Gyngard agreed, "The biggest thing out of this, is to finally get to meet some of these people I've emailed with for years. You're chatting with someone at WINDPOWER and you realize they helped you get a torque wrench three years ago. And the reception at Angel Stadium, that was an awesome way to kick it off, so much fun." Gyngard organizes a network of wind turbine technicians, the "Tower Climbing Grease Monkeys". Adams added, "We've already sold over 90 percent of the exhibit space for next year's conference. We think you'll be blown away when WINDPOWER 2018 arrives in the Windy City." AWEA is the national trade association of the U.S. wind energy industry. We represent 1,000 member companies and over 100,000 jobs in the U.S. economy, serving as a powerful voice for how wind works for America. Members include global leaders in wind power and energy development, turbine manufacturing, and component and service suppliers. They gather each year at the Western Hemisphere's largest wind power trade show, the AWEA WINDPOWER Conference & Exhibition, next in Anaheim, California, May 22-26, 2017.

But, all of those who knowingly make money off other people’s demise should be shut down and fined, and maybe even jailed. That rule of thumb should go for companies, organizations and corporations too, not to mention regulatory agencies, but that’s more of a utopian world, that doesn’t exist, and from the looks of things, probably never will.   Since the beginning of time, indigenous peoples have found natural foods, herbs, tinctures, berries, mushrooms and minerals that prevent and cure all types of infectious diseases, but in America, only a small portion of the population know about them, and some of those folks don’t even believe in them anymore. What’s the reason for that? Fear. Immense fear has been instilled in citizens by their government, that takes a few of the worst-case-scenarios for each infectious disease, and promotes propaganda to literally scare people to death (a slow death via toxic medicines). There are pictures of children who got polio and lost the use of their limbs! There are pictures of babies covered from head to toe with smallpox and measles and chicken pox … OMG! There are nine-year-old girls being injected with a toxic jab for a benign sexually transmitted disease that’s a form of contagious cancer! Just how many nine-year-olds are engaged in sexual activity? One thing is for sure: many of those girls are going into anaphylactic shock and comas shortly after the HPV vaccine, and it’s not because they are promiscuous. Then there are the fake diseases conjured up by the nefarious multi-billion-dollar vaccine industry, and propagated by the CDC, and hyped to the fullest extent by the mass media, with lies about breakouts and pandemics, so that everyone will rush to the nearest doctor, pharmacy or Walmart and get stuck with a needle full of MSG, mercury, formaldehyde and aluminum, not to mention combinations of genetically engineered organisms, bacteria and live viruses there really may not be a cure for. Who wants some of that? The fact is, people don’t want to “take a chance,” because they’ve been brainwashed into believing that the only medicine that works for sickness and disease is chemical medicine made in a laboratory and “approved” by the FDA and CDC. Big mistake. Huge mistake. These are the same people who will have compromised immune systems, unpredictable pathogens in their blood, and actually become more susceptible to the very infectious diseases they’re paranoid about catching. How ironic. That’s capitalism for you. So shut up and go get stuck with poisons, or do a little homework and find out that the real conspiracy is Western medicine trying to make a fortune off the ill health they create and then treat with more damaging “medicine.” The 9 vaccines you NEVER need, that won’t protect you from anything, especially the diseases they’re labeled to prevent Chicken pox vaccine (Varicella) Measles vaccine (or MMR: measles, mumps, rubella) Zika virus vaccine Influenza vaccine (flu shot) Swine flu vaccine (H1N1) Bird Flu vaccine (H5N1–Avian) Polio vaccine HPV (human papillomavirus) Anthrax vaccine What the medical industrial complex doesn’t want anyone to know The real reason many children and babies have weaker immune systems than adults is because they receive over 50 toxic vaccines before age 7, as recommended by the CDC and the state department – and enforced at gunpoint in certain states, like California. Chicken pox is a common childhood disease caused by a virus that lasts two to four days, and then most children are immune to it for life. Measles is like a cold that can include a cough, fever and a blotchy rash that fades after a few days and peels. Mumps is an acute viral infection usually accompanied by a mild fever lasting a couple of days, with a sore throat and swollen glands. What the medical industrial complex doesn’t want anyone to know is that the normal human body that’s not beaten down and infected by vaccine toxins and food toxins beats these infections easily. Same goes for the Zika virus, which does not cause deformations in babies; that’s all a huge lie and scare tactic. The swine flu was a hoax, as was the vaccine, and those vaccine manufacturers have paid out millions in damages due directly to that toxic jab. Then there’s the MMR vaccine that causes autism, as confessed by the head CDC scientist, Dr. William Thompson. The anthrax vaccine is highly experimental and dangerous, and the polio vaccine, given by injection or through oral or nasal application, actually spreads the disease, with those children themselves becoming carriers, infecting other children and family members. It’s criminal and the vaccine industry knows it, but the profits from selling the vaccine to all the paranoid parents and brainwashed, uneducated folks through fear-mongering far outweigh the damages paid out in settlements for health detriment. It’s a simple formula for evil capitalistic success: sell millions of toxic vaccines and create a slush fund from about 1 percent of those profits to shut parents up who try to sue the industry when their kids and babies become crippled and maimed. The only thing parents should be scared of is the vaccine industry. Take measures to build immunity with organic food and holistic medicine, and don’t fall for all the propaganda and fear-mongering spread by the CDC in America. End of story.

Analysts and journalists sifted, categorized, and created slick infographics coded in blue and red. A trend emerged: the polarization of urban and rural America. The Washington Post reported that “[t]he majority of counties with populations greater than 500,000 — where roughly half of Americans live — swung further to the left.” (Even in stalwart red states like Texas and Georgia.) Small and midsized counties, on the other hand, shifted right. Yes, despite our digital interconnectedness and the seeming ubiquity of globalized commercial culture — a.k.a. a Starbucks on every corner — the city and the country are still divided, splintering the American Dream. It is into this divide that Keith Krumwiede forges with his Atlas of Another America (Park Books, 2016). An architectural proposition in the form of a historical treatise, Krumwiede’s Atlas presents an agrarian-minded “Twenty-first century settlement scheme for the American Nation.” His is a vision of a vast suburban landscape that substitutes pastoral for rural and collective for urban. Gone are the Walmarts and Monsanto acreage. Gone are brownstones, bodegas, and third-wave coffee baristas. Or, in the words of David Byrne: “This was a Pizza Hut / Now it’s all covered with daisies.” Across 270 pages of text, illustrated with 150 images, Krumwiede lays out a fantasy for another way of American life, built from the failures of the recent past and probable near future. It is a non-place, a utopia called Freedomland. At the core of the Freedomland fiction is a riff on Thomas Jefferson’s grid system. The Virginian imagined a democratic landscape populated by yeoman citizens. His vision was, in duly democratic fashion, both expansive and scalar, national and individual. The heartland would be divided up into 24-by-24-mile quadrangles, which would then be split into six-by-six-mile townships, and one-by-one-mile sections — that telltale patchwork produced by the Land Ordinance of 1785 and Public Land Survey System. Lastly, the sections are divvied up into 40-acre homesteads, each the domain of a family farm and the prototype for the single-family home. Freedomland follows the Jeffersonian model at the start, but differs at the scale of the township. Subdivided into quarters, each township holds two towns and two natural preserves. The result, writes Krumwiede, is “an alternating arrangement of town and country” — a checkerboard covering the flyover states. Within Freedomland’s grid a secondary pattern emerges: a new infrastructure for this reconceived pastoral. At the center of each town is a four-part civic core that includes a circular reservoir, a half-mile square array of solar panels, a market square (part public forum, part big box store), and “an ever-growing, manicured pyramid of refuse.” Krumwiede skirts details on local politics (and the identity politics embedded within) by suggesting that each town is an “independent self-governed community.” Architecturally, he’s reduced civic life to its most elemental: water, power, talk, and trash. His quaint, simple arrangements reflect local prescriptions for global ailments of the Anthropocene: shared water resources in the face of drought, solar panels instead of oil pipelines, a town square rather than fake news, and sculptural landfill instead of floating islands of plastic debris. The omniscient logic of the grid and the elemental drawings of the infrastructure — pyramid, circle, array, and cross — imply that order itself could be a sustainable solution to larger crises. It’s an architectural conceit, which Krumwiede enters into knowingly. Architects have long fetishized grids of all kinds. Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas (who, along with Jefferson, is a chief protagonist in Krumwiede’s tale) wrote of the Manhattan grid in his early theoretical opus Delirious New York (1978): “it claims the superiority of mental construction over reality.” And then there is Superstudio’s The Continuous Monument of 1969. Krumwiede never mentions the Italian radicals’ endless black-and-white grid, but it is an implicit critical counterpoint as much as bedfellow. The Continuous Monument’s grid is urban, the product of an architecture of reason. Freedomland’s grid is suburban. Nevertheless, both share an understanding of architecture as responsive to societal, political, and economic conditions. In Domus, the Superstudio described the role of an architecture of reason: “To bear witness becomes working in history, with history and for history.” Atlas of Another America pegs to the late 2000s and the economic downturn triggered by runaway real estate speculation. Krumwiede began his project amid the recession. Embedded in his fiction is a key lesson from the subprime mortgage crisis, which laid waste to large swaths of the suburban nation. Namely, as Krumwiede writes, the single-family house is not only “the preeminent representation of its owner’s aspirations,” it is also a disposable commodity. (This lesson also lies at the heart of the Make America Great Again narrative.) The pre-crash housing boom ushered in a plethora of model home types — catalogs of construction that catered to a mass-customization market and could be tailored to a buyer’s identity and bank account. While the real results proved economically, environmentally, and socially unsustainable (cue the ruin porn footage of abandoned Sunbelt subdivisions) the decayed conditions spur the imagination — especially the imaginations of those in metropolitan areas who weren’t directly impacted by the trauma. The debris of the bust became an evergreen story during the downturn, with writer after writer calling for reassessments of the suburban frontier. Krumwiede builds the housing in his neighborhood estates not from stacks of two-by-fours and drywall, but from the bounty of model homes types — an intellectual resource long overlooked by critics and practitioners alike. In Freedomland, the home designs are drawn from catalogs of the nation’s most popular model home builders and collaged into lumpy aggregations of pitched roofs and family rooms — communities of shoulder-to-shoulder McMansions. For example, the Walden eight neighborhood farm estate in Section 14 comprises 16 houses assembled in two closed loops; at the center of each loop is a shared green space and water feature. For this, Krumwiede appropriated the 4,625-square-foot Shea Homes, Plan 2, at Maravilla (a luxury planned community in Chula Vista, California). The premise is as perverse as it is postmodern: the object of singularity, the single family home, is packed tight into figural villages. In certain cases, Krumwiede doubles down on his postmodernism, producing seamless Photoshop illustrations that sneak his mashed-up McMansions into the backgrounds of paintings of idyllic country life. Thus the Russian realist Grigoriy Myasoyedov’s The Mowers (1887) becomes The Mowers at A Chateau. In the foreground, bearded and babushka’d peasants harvest waist-high wheat, while A Chateau — a portmanteau estate composed of eight 4,217-square-foot Meritage Homes — looms in the background. Others depict more gentry scenes: a hunting party (after Swiss landscape painter Jacques-Laurent Agasse’s work from 1818) or a Sunday stroll (after an 1841 canvas by German romanticist Carl Spitzweg). The township drawings pay homage to the concept of the phalanstery, a self-supporting utopian enclave first conceived by French philosopher Charles Fourier in the early 19th century. As a building compound, the phalanstery is meant to combine aspects of both urban and rural life, with different areas for labor, leisure, and living set within a greater landscape. The Freedomland plans, based on homebuilder “found materials,” are not as prescribed as Fourier’s, but they are still willfully utopian. In the stylized images, however, Krumwiede’s intentions are less clear, especially when it comes to class and labor. While texts in the Atlas suggest a communal society, the images depict a social stratification left over from another time: farmworkers and gentlepeople, with little in between. This hollow center devoid of artisans and merchants (and those other occupations that span between the two) could be Krumwiede’s commentary on the blitzed-out middle class — the stratum of society most attached to the American Dream. But that narrative runs counter to Krumwiede’s sustainable, holistic fiction. He never answers what work looks like in this other America? How do his Americans support themselves at the intersection of urban and rural life? Two of Krumwiede’s touchstones — 18th-century French architect Claude Nicolas Ledoux and Koolhaas — offer competing ideas. Late in life, Ledoux produced a series of visionary sketches illustrating the concept of architecture parlante. His designs argue for an architecture that represents the vocation of its subject — such as a barrel-shaped house for a cooper, or a house for a woodcutter that’s shaped like a pyramidal stack of logs and bears a graphical resemblance to the Freedomland waste pyramid. There’s a direct correlation between architecture, labor, and identity. Koolhaas suggests the opposite. In September 2014, British design magazine Icon published his article on European “countryside architecture,” in which he discusses his firm OMA’s research in rural villages in Holland, Switzerland, and Italy. “What we found,” Koolhaas writes, “was a thriving prototype of the non-agricultural countryside — a new genre of land use called ‘the intermediate’ — a well-manicured place where surface appearances bear almost no relation to what is actually happening on the land and in the buildings.” OMA’s investigation uncovered Southeast Asian and Indian populations tending the land, automated farms, and digital husbandry. These regions have been reshaped by the same changes (immigration, mechanization) that have affected the United States, inspiring anti-immigrant sentiment and conditioning the appeal of #MAGA. In truth, Krumwiede does hint at a form of work — or, at least, a unifying activity for the citizens of Freedomland: demolition and construction. Toward the end of his opening text, he sketches out a process akin to crop rotation for the buildings he proposes. “[T]he entire estate, including the dwellings, which are dismantled and rebuilt, rotates counterclockwise every twenty years, completing a full rotation after eighty years,” he writes, noting that “advances in home building technology” would eventually lead to less material waste and more efficient methods. Perhaps then, images of Freedomland should depict the settlement in continual rise and fall — its populace not mounted on steeds or wielding a sickle, but instead wearing hard hats and toting crowbars. The story of reconstruction, repurposing, and recycling permeates the Atlas, both in the collaged images and in the texts themselves. For example, Notes on Freedomland, a numbered list of 40 remarks, is essentially a mixtape of 18th- and 19th-century commentary on housing and residential architecture, with a few more contemporary bits thrown in. It is akin to “The Ecstasy of Influence,” Jonathan Lethem’s 2007 essay for Harper’s in which the author lifts texts from other sources and self-consciously plagiarizes them into a single voice — though Krumwiede is careful to footnote. Point 23 begins, “It is not good for either town or country to live alone,” and is pinched from William Arthur’s self-published volume Our Home City (1911). “Atypical Plans,” is another postmodern textual exercise. Using Koolhaas’s essay “Typical Plan” as a starting point, Krumwiede redacts letters, words, sentences, and inserts his own language. [A]Typical Plan[s] is are minimalism maximalism for the masses; already latent in the first brutally exuberantly non-utilitarian explorations, by the end of the era of [A]Typical Plan[s], i.e., the sixties NOW, the non-utilitarian is refined as a sensuous science of coordination—oversized columns grids, massive multi-layered facades modules, coffered ceilings, marble tiles, accent lighting, luxurious bathroom fixtures, partitions, abundant electrical outlets, hardwood flooring, artfully staged furniture, tasteful color schemes, central air-conditioning grills—that transcends the practical to emerge in a rarified existential domain of pure guilt-free objectivity subjectivity. The result remakes a mediation on the American office building into a reflection on residential architecture in the 21st century, a bruised and battered topic in design circles. Indeed, for all the talk of local agriculture and yeomen farmers, the real agenda of the Atlas might be to foreground the act of repurposing itself. Architecture is a field obsessed with the “new” and “now,” a solutionist discipline carried by belief in itself. On occasions when architects do look back, they cherry-pick the best, highest-minded examples of their profession to use as precedent. Repurposing, then, becomes a self-reinforcing enterprise, one that preserves the myths of singular genius and creative authorship. Krumwiede asks architects to mine what they would have considered waste — the aspirational writings of previous generations and dreamy model home plans. In assembling this refuse into a possible utopia, Krumwiede offers a fertile methodology to a discipline glutted by its own speculative production. ¤ Mimi Zeiger is a Los Angeles-based critic, editor, and curator.

If you missed it, here’s last week’s recap of episode 1. Welcome back, Sports Bachelor Nation. It’s Monday night of Memorial Day, so if you’re sitting on your couch sunburned and very full, please know you’re not alone. Luckily, we’ve got Rachel Lindsay’s search for happily ever after to distract us from the fact that we ate our weight in grilled meats (or vegetables, if you’re into that sort of thing) and drank a few too many beers over the past few days. Speaking of beers, let’s watch some dudes get drunk and embarrass themselves on television as they try to make Rachel fall head over heels in love with them. RACHEL’S DOG IS BACK! We’re at Rachel’s temporary Bachelorette pad, where she’s talking about Her Journey so far. As she says that she’s getting good at being vulnerable, we zoom in on a shot of her dog with a cast on its leg. This seems like a metaphor, but I can’t be sure. I have a message to the producers: HELLO PRODUCERS PLEASE TELL US MORE ABOUT RACHEL’S DOG AND EXPLAIN WHY ITS LEG IS IN A CAST THANK YOU. GROUP DATE ANNOUNCEMENT In the mansion, the men are wearing henleys — official shirt of the Bachelor franchise. These men all look like the guy on the front of pack of Hanes shirts that you can buy in bulk at Walmart. I can only imagine that house smells like the men’s locker room before a middle school dance, and I sincerely hope Rachel isn’t asthmatic. Chris “My Personal Trainer Says I’m Very Strong for a Man My Age” Harrison tells the men that A) there will be two group dates and one one-on-one this week and B) that he hopes the men are present for The Right Reasons. HUSBAND HUNTING The group date begins and we’re in a field. Rachel is grilling some burgers and shrimp. She throws a football because The Bachelorette is sports, and her spiral is better than many of the dudes’. The arm of an angel! #TheBachelorette pic.twitter.com/KhCJWCrLUD— The Bachelorette (@BacheloretteABC) May 30, 2017 In an aside to the camera, Blake — the aspiring drummer with a mushroom cut from my fourth grade class in the ’90s — says that Lucas (Whaaabooooom Guy) is a garbage person who is NOT there for The Right Reasons. I can already tell that Blake’s made himself the Guy Who Hates Whaaabooooom Guy. Blake will undoubtedly spend most of his one-on-one time with Rachel trashing Lucas and then both Blake and Lucas will go home fairly soon after. Rachel says that her friends are coming over. Her friends turn out to be Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis. It turns out that Ashton and Mila are huge Bachelor fans and called the producers to let them be on the show. I’m not sure if this is true, or if one of them has a contract with ABC and had to appear on this as part of a deal. Ashton and Mila are funny. Mila is like, “Who here has health insurance?” Health insurance and kind eyes are really all I’m looking for in a man, so I appreciate this. THE ULTIMATE HUSBAND OBSTACLE COURSE FOR VERY STRONG BOYS Everyone knows the first thing a man must do when he’s trying to woo a woman is run an obstacle course that includes changing the diaper on a fake baby, running around with a vacuum, unclogging a drain that’s inexplicably clogged in the middle of a field, and buying her flowers. The men do this. Kenny says he has an advantage because he’s super dad to his 10-year-old daughter, but Whaaabooom Guy wins thanks to what I think was an illegal stiff-arm. Mila calls him “Wazoozoo Guy.” “I don’t think Rachel’s guy is in this group,” Ashton says, and I agree. NIGHT DATE AT WHAT LOOKS LIKE A USED FURNITURE STORE Rachel and her big strong boys go to an arcade bar or a used furniture warehouse (I can’t tell, which doesn’t bode well for the future of the establishment) for the evening portion of their date. Blake is on a tear, because it turns out he knows Lucas (Wazoozoo Guy) from before the show, because Lucas used to date Blake’s roommate. Lucas reads Rachel a poem and Rachel is kind, so she smiles, but the poem is terrible. Blake is in full-on self-destruction mode. He does, indeed, spend his one-on-one time trashing Lucas to Rachel, but it turns out there’s some back story here: Blake says he lives with Lucas’ ex-girlfriend, that Lucas is a “clown for TV exposure,” and that Lucas wears makeup so he’ll look good on TV. (PLOT TWIST: The Hollywood Reporter did some digging and found that the two were on a previous reality show together.) Blake leaves his time with Rachel having only spoken about Lucas. Lucas and Blake then trade dumb insults for a while until Lucas, who is slurring his speech because he’s so drunk, says Blake “is dismissed.” The producers zoom in on a creepy clown face, which feels like another metaphor. DEAN’S SURPRISING COME-FROM-BEHIND Dean shocks the world by making Rachel laugh a lot and stirring up what seem like romantic feelings. Rachel tells Dean she truly did like it when he said, “I’m ready to go black and I’m not going back,” but that she wanted to say it first, and he stole her line. Dean, who is 25 and slightly awkward, looks extremely relieved. His hand is on her leg. Kenny and Rachel have a nice moment where Kenny tells her about his daughter. Kenny is earnest, sweet, and kind. I think I love Kenny. Rachel gives Dean — whose name might as well be Blake, he totally looks like a Blake — the First Impression rose and he then makes out with her. Looks like a decent kiss. Better than Bryan’s from last episode at least. Rachel seems pleased. QUICK ASIDE ABOUT LEE We cut to Lee, the singer-songwriter du jour, for a moment during the group date. He’s at the mansion, talking shit about the other dudes, and you can tell the producers are setting him up to be The Real Villain (Lucas is The Clown-y Villain). These wily puppeteers producers are brilliant. PETER’S MAGICAL DOG DATE FROM HEAVEN Peter gets the one-on-one date. This isn’t shocking, because Rachel seemed so drawn to him last episode. He’s very handsome and knows how to drive, which is always a plus in a partner. He proves he can drive by driving Rachel in a Tesla to a private plane. Tesla must’ve paid out the ass for sponsorship this season because they’ve featured very prominently so far. On the tarmac, Rachel throws a serious curveball when she says that this date will actually be a two-on-one, because her injured best friend is coming along. I’m like, man, is this going to be another famous person, like Kawhi Leonard? AND THEN IT’S HER DOG!!! It’s Rachel’s adorable, hurt, beautiful dog, Copper. The producers must’ve heard me (and the rest of America) as we clamored for more information about this adorable pooch, because here he is. I am tearing up. THERE ARE SOOOO MANY GOOD DOGS ON THIS DATE OH MY GOD Rachel, Peter, and Copper get on a private plane and fly to a dog party at a dog hotel. This date isn’t fair to the other contestants, because who wouldn’t immediately fall in love with a handsome man who took them to a dog hotel? We still don’t know how Copper was injured, but we do know that Peter would move to Dallas for Rachel, and that the sparks, they are a flyin’. Peter dances with Copper in a sea of other humans who are also dancing with their dogs. Both Peter and Rachel have personalities, which is something new and different for this show. My key takeaway so far is that we all need dogs, and then we need handsome men, and then we need those man to bring all of us to dog parties at dog hotels. TOOTH DATE Rachel and Peter go on a delightful evening date where they talk about their matching tooth gaps (never thought I’d find a conversation on dentistry so fascinating, but here we are). Copper gets his own seat. And then something wonderful happens: Both Rachel and Peter talk about how they went to see therapists after their last relationships fell apart. As an anxious person who believes strongly in therapy, I am highly, highly, highly in favor of getting rid of the stigma that goes along with taking care of mental health issues. Talking about it openly on national television is important, unexpected, and I’m here for it. Appropriate fireworks for a smitten kitten! #TheBachelorette pic.twitter.com/eNRSt1PcIK— The Bachelorette (@BacheloretteABC) May 30, 2017 Rachel is the best lead in this history of reality TV. Peter is the clear front-runner right now. BASKETBALL DATE Rachel and another group of merry men go to play basketball at a school gym. I can’t help but feel like maybe ABC is playing into how many sportswriters watch this show, because there are so many sports this season. There are also good dogs, which are definitely sports. And then Kareem Abdul-Jabbar shows up to coach basketball. This is very much sports, too, but it’s also somewhat surprising, because Kareem wrote a nuanced and spot-on op-ed in February about how The Bachelor and Bachelorette have had an abysmal amount of diversity and a serious lack of any real conversation: “The real crime is the lack of intellectual and appearance diversity, which leaves the contestants as interchangeable as the Mr. Potato Head parts. The lack of racial diversity has already been commented on. If you’re black on The Bachelor or The Bachelorette, you’re usually kept around as a courtesy for a few weeks before being ejected. Those outside the ideal body fat percentage index need not apply. With all eyes firmly fixed on firm buttocks, the criteria for finding love becomes how high a quarter will bounce off rock-hard abs. Will we ever witness a conversation that isn’t so bland and vacuous that words seem to evaporate as soon as they are spoken?” Maybe ABC listened? At any rate, the network has finally (however horribly and belatedly) made a black woman The Bachelorette. Perhaps Kareem decided he’d give the show a shot at redeeming itself and have some fun with Rachel in the meantime. Update: Kareem wrote another great op-ed explaining why he appeared on The Bachelorette. "I found it very interesting that he dunked on me today." - Rachel to Kareem. @TheRachLindsay @kaj33 #TheBachelorette pic.twitter.com/5RqqgSSg1p— The Bachelorette (@BacheloretteABC) May 30, 2017 Kareem will not give these guys a chance to redeem themselves at basketball, though, because they don’t deserve one. Lee is terrible. Kareem laughs a lot. Like, at Lee. Not with him. I love this. EVERYTHING IS FINE Everything is going great — the guys play a basketball game in front of a packed crowd, which includes the human version of one of those blow-up guys in front of car dealerships. That kid rules. Rachel and DeMario (who by now has compared himself to Michael Jordan, Tom Brady, LeBron James, and Kobe Bryant) have been seriously vibing on this date, and it’s looking like she’s going to give him the Immunity Rose, a.k.a. The Bachelorette’s version of an Epi Pen. AND THEN NOTHING IS FINE Uh oh. This woman named Lexi shows up and claims that DeMario is her boyfriend (actually she says, “Karma’s a bitch, isn’t it DeMario?”). Lexi says she saw DeMario on After the Final Rose at the end of Nick’s season, when DeMario was one of the guys who showed up to meet Rachel before her season started. DeMario pretends not to know Lexi at first, which is a mistake, because Lexi has text messages between the two of them in which DeMario says, “goodnight, babe.” Nominate this for Act Break of the Year #TheBachelorette pic.twitter.com/7xHtRTNo1V— Mark (@tole_cover) May 30, 2017 Lexi says the texts prove DeMario never ended their relationship before he went on the show, but DeMario says he ended it in person, so there wouldn’t be any texts. Rachel gives DeMario a chance to explain what happened, but he kind of fumbles through it, saying that Lexi is nuts. Lexi swears on her father’s grave and on her two kittens that DeMario is lying. She also calls him a piece of trash. DeMario is like, “I don’t have keys to your apartment!” And then he’s like “Oh, those keys. Yeah, I mailed them back.” Both of these people are ... maybe not the best. Rachel lays down the law: “I don’t want to be played, I don’t want to be made a joke of, so I’m really going to need you to get the f[bleep] out. I don’t like being f[bleeping] embarrassed.” "I’m really going to need you to get the f*@% out!” -Rachel#TheBachelorette pic.twitter.com/dbXKvlfbQa— The Bachelorette (@BacheloretteABC) May 30, 2017 She sends DeMario home. Lexi also leaves. RACHEL LAYS DOWN THE LAW SOME MORE Rachel goes into the locker room and she’s like DON’T FUCK WITH ME, YOU ASSHOLES. And by that I mean she graciously and kindly says: “I pride myself in being real. If any of you have a girlfriend, please just tell me now, because it makes me sick that I sent people home. So with that being said, I’ll see you tonight.” The guys are like WHAAAAAAT and pretend they can’t believe anyone would ever cheat or do anything bad. One guy, maybe Lee (or another Blake, or another Dean, I don’t know, there are too many) says, “That’s insane to me, how can you be so duplicitous?” And I’m like, oh yeah, because I’m sure all of you are a bunch of goddamn saints. NIGHT DATE AFTER THE DEMARIO DISASTER Rachel tells the camera that “DeMario is a dirty, dirty dog” and that it’s making her “question the other men’s real intentions. I need to look past charm and see them for who they are and recognize their true character.” "I need to look past the charm and see them for who they are and recognize their true character." -Rachel#TheBachelorette pic.twitter.com/F5tVAYpfut— The Bachelorette (@BacheloretteABC) May 30, 2017 That seems maybe not possible after two weeks of knowing someone, but if anyone can do it, I believe it’s Rachel Lindsay. The other guys, meanwhile, are still milking the DeMario thing for all it’s worth. They’re all like I WOULD NEVER HURT YOU OR ANY WOMAN LIKE THAT! Right. And my uncle’s the Easter Bunny. Josiah swoops in and acts all protective, which could seem bad, but seems maybe good? I don’t even know anymore. But he’s wearing a great outfit, he’s quite attractive, and he’s very smooth, so I am somewhat taken with him. Rachel seems to be, too, because she gives him the Immunity Rose. A FEW RANDOM THOUGHTS Diggy wears Von Miller glasses. I like Diggy, I think. We have a Diggy and an Iggy, which is an -iggy record for The Bachelorette. Alex sings to Rachel in Russian. Rachel tells Eric that quality time and physical touch are the things that make her feel loved. I love how sex positive she is. Go Rachel. All women should have good sex. We haven’t seen enough of Anthony!!!!! I want more of Anthony!! Kisses on live mics are disgusting. We’re only two episodes in and this entire episode is better than Nick’s whole dumb season. DEMARIO COMES BACK?! So Bryan, the one who kissed Rachel first, is a chiropractor. He sets up a massage table at the cocktail party and gives her a massage. Bryan creeps me out, but massages are good, and Rachel seems into him. Rachel and Iggy are playing a thumb war (sexy!) when DeMario comes back to try to explain himself. The security guy goes to get Chris Harrison, who is probably asleep at his house in L.A. But Chris eventually shows up, and he’s like ... OK, DeMario, I’ll tell Rachel you’re here, but it’s up to her if she wants to talk to you. Chris is doing more this season than he did for all of the past three combined. Rachel is curious. She goes to talk to DeMario. Meanwhile, the dudes are like, “Wait, is that Chris? He’s not supposed to be here!” And then they realize DeMario is back, and they charge out like an angry mob to go get rid of him. AND THEN THE EPISODE JUST ENDS This is the best season of this show I’ve ever seen, and Episode 2 was the best episode. We had drama up the wazoo, promising suitors, and Rachel, who’s smart, funny, and sincere in a not-corny way that makes you actually believe such things as The Right Reasons (or something close to them) exist. I hope she gets her own talk show after this so we can keep watching her conduct the people around her like a symphony. Actually, no, I hope she does whatever the hell she wants to do with the love of her life. I hated this show after Nick, but now I can’t wait for next week. HOWEVER: If the producers keep doing this stupid cliff-hanger shit, I will call Copper The Adorable Injured Dog and demand he pull rank to make them stop. VERY IMPORTANT CORRECTION: A previous version of this very important recap stated, repeatedly, that Rachel’s dog is named Cooper. He is not. He is named Copper. However, the author of this article also spelled “Bachelorette” wrong in all of her tweets last night, so the error should come as a surprise to no one.

Sivan 6, 5777, 5/31/2017   MainOpEdsWhat did you buy on Memorial Day? What did you buy on Memorial Day? Isn't it - wasn't it once - a somber day of mourning and tribute for those who fell for freedom? Contact Editor Shmuel Sackett, 29/05/17 14:38 Flags planted by Jewish War Veterans of the United States Cleveland Post 14 Jewish War Veterans of the United States, via Facebook Shmuel SackettShmuel Sackett is co-founder of Manhigut Yehudit (The Jewish Leadership Movement). He currently serves as Manhigut´s International Director, lecturing frequently to Jews throughout the world. Shmuel made aliya from New York and lives in Karnei Shomron with his family. More from the author ► I can live to be 1,000 and I will never get used to the fact that Memorial Day in America is a fun, action-packed day for shoppers, beach goers and roller-coaster riders. As you know, this past Monday was the opening of the summer season, even though summer doesn’t actually hit for another few weeks. Memorial Day is like some kind of “Grand Opening party” which everyone loves to take part in. I did some internet surfing and found some great Memorial Day sales in Sears, JC Penney, Kohls, Bloomingdales, Macy’s, Banana Republic, Nordstrom, Gap, Old Navy and Walmart. The JC Penney website actually said the following; “Enjoy our Memorial Day sales”. It even suggested that one should “Extend the fun to the whole family”... Do you think you should “enjoy” sales on this day or that it should be a day of “fun” for the whole family? Let me ask you a question. Isn’t Memorial Day supposed to be somber? A day of remembrance, mourning and reflection? A day to pay tribute to the hundreds of thousands of brave men and women who lost their lives fighting for the USA? Do you have any idea how many heroes we are talking about? I did some research and found that from the American Revolutionary War until today – are you ready for this? – a total of 666,441 American soldiers have lost their lives in battle. If it’s hard for you to think about war from 1776, let me break down that number in more modern times. In WWII – 291,557 soldiers were killed and in Vietnam the number was 47,424. After 9/11, American forces went to war in Afghanistan and lost 1,954 soldiers while a whopping 3,836 have been killed in Iraq. After all this bloodshed, do you really think you should spend Memorial Day - the one day a year dedicated to the memory of these men and women - by shopping for a microwave or jeans? Do you think you should “enjoy” sales on this day or that it should be a day of “fun” for the whole family? One of the websites I looked at (a store called “Junees”) had an additional sale for people shopping on line. In order to qualify for the sale you needed to use a special coupon code during checkout. Any idea what the coupon code was? The word: “Memorial”. How touching… The website DealNews.com was pushing online sales very hard and stated that by shopping online, there will be plenty of time on Memorial Day for other things. They suggested the following; “Break out your summer whites and fire up the grill”. I guess going to a military cemetery was out of the question… The Disney World website homepage was full of wonderful suggestions on how to enjoy the park on Memorial Day even though large crowds were expected. “Start from the back” they suggested and “stay late” since most people don’t know the park is open late for your “Memorial Day enjoyment”. There’s simply nothing like bonding with Mickey Mouse on such a somber day… DelGrosso’s Amusement Park (in Tipton, PA) had a great website that advertised their “Memorial Day Weekend Celebration” and even offered a coupon called the “Memorial Day Fun Pass” but stated that the discount was “valid on Memorial Day only”. I guess they don’t want you to have fun all year round, just Memorial Day… And finally, I saw a few amusement park sites that offered “free admission to servicemen and women in uniform on Memorial Day”. Hey buddy, how come you are all by yourself? Oh, your 3 friends were killed in battle in Iraq? That’s too bad… well, at least you’re here – in uniform - so come for free and have a great time! Just one request, can you please wipe the blood off your uniform, it’s bothering some of our guests… Let me say this loud and clear; A society that celebrates Memorial Day with sales, picnics and amusement park fun is a society in trouble. Actually, it’s worse than that. It’s downright sick. 666,441 soldiers gave their life for America and the country can’t take one day off to honor them?? Let’s pause for a moment and review how Memorial Day is commemorated (not “celebrated”) in Israel. All stores, except gas stations, are closed. Amusement parks are closed. Beaches are empty. Israeli Mickey Mouses (or is it Mickey Mice…) are home from work. Nobody is grilling and nobody is enjoying. Following Jewish tradition, the day begins the night before with a siren at 8pm and the entire country stands for a moment of silence. Some stand with heads down, others say Tehillim to themselves but everyone is quiet and respectful. About 30% of the country attend some sort of “Yom Ha’Zikaron” (that’s “Memorial Day” in Hebrew) commemoration in cities around Israel, while the rest of the country watches it on TV. There is an eerie silence in the air and most of the people shed tears for soldiers they never even knew. The next morning, there is a siren at 11am and military cemeteries from Eilat to Kiryat Shemonah are packed with people crying, hugging, praying and reflecting. While “The Gap” in New York is open on Memorial Day, the ones in Israel are closed. People have told me that the reason for all this is simple. In Israel everyone knows someone who has lost a loved one in a war. In my shul alone, there are 2 regular attendees who each lost a brother; one in the ’56 war and one in the ’67 war. Add to that the people in my shul who lost friends and comrades and the number easily rises to over 50. Compare that to America. Who in your shul has a relative, friend or even a distant acquaintance who was killed in battle while fighting for the USA? Probably nobody. Yet, I am sorry to say,  I do not accept that answer. Not having a personal connection to one of the 666,441 US soldiers is not an excuse to “enjoy” the day off nor use the word “Memorial” while shopping online at Junees. If you live in a free country, you need to realize and appreciate that the freedom you enjoy came at a price. Yes, you may not personally know the heroes who sacrificed their lives so you can enjoy baseball and apple-pie but they were definitely there. They fought and died so that you can live in a beautiful home, have that good job and send your children to the yeshiva of your choice. The very fact that you can walk freely to shul, dunk in a mikveh and carry on Shabbat within your community eruv is because of these 666,441 men and women. I firmly believe that every Jew must come home as soon as possible to Israel but until that day arrives, we owe a debt of gratitude to the land of the free and the home of the brave. Torah institutions have flourished in America and I am religious today because of the wonderful education I received in various NY yeshivas and shuls. To me, it’s not about knowing the fallen soldiers personally. Rather, it’s about acknowledging their commitment, their selflessness and their ultimate sacrifice. I thank Hashem every day for bringing my grandparents to America in the early 1900’s. Where would I be today if they had stayed in Europe? Would I even be alive? And if I was alive, would I still be Jewish? 3 of my 4 grandparents emigrated from what is today Ukraine and the fourth was from Lithuania. When they came to America, they were allowed to practice Yiddishkeit without oppression. My parents of blessed memory, were both born in America, lived a Jewish life and sent my siblings and me to yeshiva day schools. My father fought in WWII and so did his brother, who was awarded 2 purple hearts. My mother’s 2 brothers also fought in WWII and we were raised on giving thanks and appreciating what others had done. Today’s youth are far from appreciating anything. They focus, almost exclusively, on smartphones, selfies and Snapchat. I fear for their future but point the finger – not at them – but at a society that takes one of the few meaningful days a year and turns it into fun and games. We have a year to change that until next Memorial Day. Let’s make it happen.

It’s a turnaround story that grabs attention. Anubhav Sahu Moneycontrol Research The FMCG space has been seized by turbulence due to the disruptive Patanjali entering the fray. But one can’t deny the secular growth prospects of the sector. In trying to make the most of these two conflicting realities, we came across a company that benefits from both the growth of the new challenger and the secular rise in consumption. The relatively unheard of player is JHS Svendgaard, a contract manufacturer for oral care products catering to companies like Patanjali and Dabur that is on an expansion spree. It’s a turnaround story that grabs attention because it is a surrogate play on the disruptor’s aggression, offers an opportunity to participate in the growing oral care market, and now boasts of a clean and strong balance sheet. Biggest oral care contract manufacturer JHS is one of the biggest oral care contract manufacturers and currently produces oral care products like toothbrushes and tooth paste (50 percent of revenue each). The company currently caters to major FMCG manufacturers which are expected to constitute 70-75 percent of FY 2017-18 revenue. In addition, JHS is also focusing on its own brand (10-12 percent of revenue). The company’s major clients include Dabur, Patanjali, Amway, Vanessa, Marya Day, Walmart and Emami. Oral care: Secular growth  India’s per capita toothpaste consumption of 147 g (vs China 277 g) is amongst the lowest in the world. Growing awareness about oral healthcare underlines the secular growth potential for this sector. Colgate, the dominant player in the toothpaste category has lost market share (57.4 percent to 55.1 percent) in last two years to Dabur and Patanjali, both JHS clients, suggesting a healthy orderbook growth will continue. Source: Moneycontrol Research Turnaround story – zero debt company JHS had posted a loss during 2013-2016 on account of the failed arrangement with its then key client, a major FMCG player, that led to litigation. Recently, the company reached an out-of-court settlement, helping it to clear a contingent liability of Rs 206 crore. Over the years, the company has worked on reducing debt and at present has near-zero debt on its balance sheet. Learning its lesson from the above episode, JHS is working on the diversification of its client base and limiting exposure to any single entity. For 2020, JHS is targeting 50 percent revenue share from its own brand and limiting single client exposure to about 15 percent. However, depending on the robust contract manufacturing opportunity, the ambition to establish its own brand might undergo changes. In the FY 2016-17, the company posted a profit of Rs 21.98 crore (vs loss of Rs 21.63 crore in FY 2015-16), partially aided by topline growth of 5.4 percent. Earnings Snapshot (Rs crore) Source: Moneycontrol Research Capacity ramp-up and the client consolidation Our conversation with the vice-president (finance) of JHS Svendgaard, Ashish Goel, gave us interesting insights into the company’s capacity expansion plans and success in client consolidation. In the FY17, capacity utilisation improved to 80 percent from the level of 60 percent a year before.  The new capacity expansion, to be commissioned in early 2017-18 at Kala Amb, Himachal Pradesh, would increase capacity by about 80 percent (100 percent in toothpaste and 70 percent in toothbrush category). The company is targeting volume growth to the tune of 45-50 percent in 2017-18 as about 50 percent of the capacity expansion is already backed up by client commitments. Client consolidation is another area where the outlook appears to be promising. In Q4 2017, company started tooth paste manufacturing for Patanjali along with the existing tooth brush manufacturing. Thus, making Patanjali its biggest client. Dabur is the second biggest-client, for which JHS had already been manufacturing both product categories. Thus, after Colgate, the two biggest FMCG players in the oral care products, are sourcing from JHS.  Interestingly, their market share is increasing in this niche segment. Thus, in a way, JHS is a proxy for the entire segment of dental care growth in India. Reduced margins may be new normal for FMCG sector EBITDA margins were at 11 percent for FY 2016-17 and expected to be in the range of 13-15 percent in the medium-term through improvement in product mix and scale. Given the nature of business and the current competitive pressure, we don’t expect margins to go back to 2008-10 levels when it reported 23-25 percent. Valuation not a hindrance given earnings growth Based on reported numbers, JHS is trading at FY 2017 P/E of 10x. However, if we take the tax benefit accrued in Q4 2017 into account, adjusted P/E multiple is about 43x vs FMCG average of ~ 52x. We expect the margin trajectory to improve as the company ramps up production. The company is expected to report 111 percent earnings CAGR in FY17-19E. So on PEG basis, stock is trading at 0.4, which is attractive in our view. In sum, we think that JHS Svendgaard is an indirect play on Patanjali’s volume growth in select high-growing segments and also a proxy for Indian dental care consumption growth. We advise clients to accumulate this stock for the medium term.Follow @anubhavsays tags #Baba Ramdev Patanjali Ayurved #BSE FMCG #Business #Dabur #JHS Svendgaard Laboratories #Stocks Views Related news Business Nokia 3, 5 and 6 android smartphones to be available starting June 15: Report May 31, 2017 11:58 AM Business Should Air India be sold?

Through combination of visual recognition engines, sensors, and artificial intelligence, retailers will be better able to detect criminal behaviour and take remedial action Nick Ismail Remember the Café 80s scene from Back to the Future Part 2, where Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) tells an image of Ronald Reagan on a TV screen that he just wants a Pepsi, and a bottle of Pepsi Perfect mysteriously appears from inside the table in front of him. Today’s retail may not be that automated yet, but is rapidly evolving to a cashier-less environment – especially by leveraging the power of mobile connectivity. Tap a button on the Uber app and a car shows up ready to take you to your destination. With a few clicks on your phone, order your favourite caffeinated concoction, and it will be ready at your nearest Starbucks by the time you walk in. Technology pundits had predicted that mobile payments would be the wave of the future, and will change commercial interactions forever. In reality, mobile payments have struggled to gain ground in the developed world, because it’s just as easy to pay with a card as it is to pay with a phone. (The story, of course is very different in places like China and Kenya, where using the mobile phone to pay has become ubiquitous, since alternative digital payment methods were non-existent). >See also: The future of retail: just technology It required re-thinking the merchant-customer relationship in the developed world, and removing the focus away from purely payments, and more to the other aspects of customer brand affinity and experience. Starbucks broke new ground by bundling in-app payment together with loyalty (i.e. free drinks), which led to 15% of U.S. Starbucks sales coming in via mobile. Then in 2015, Starbucks launched the Order & Pay feature which allowed customers to place and pay for orders from their mobile devices, skipping the line when they pick up their beverages in-store. Before long, the percentage of app sales rose to 26% and the Starbucks app now processes more than 10 million transactions a month. On March 31, Starbucks made it clear that it was not done innovating on the checkout process. Order & Pay became so popular that the lines at the pickup counters became longer than the lines at the cashier’s. In response to the congestion problem, Starbucks recently debuted a test store in Seattle that eliminates the cashier counter and seating. It will only accept orders placed via Order & Pay, and if successful, could serve as a blueprint for locations around the country. Amazon also saw an opportunity to redefine the merchant-customer shopping experience, using technology and AI smarts, as they made their foray into physical commerce. Amazon Go is testing a concept using mobile check-in, image processing and AI-based decision making. This allowed shoppers to walk into a store, check in with their phone, pick the items they want to buy, and walk out of the store. There are no lines and all payment happens in the cloud. >See also: Is the mobile the future of payments? Walmart, Sam’s Club, and Kroger’s also offer various “Bag & Go” capabilities, allowing shoppers to scan items with their mobile phones and then walk to a dedicated aisle to complete their purchase and checkout. The line in this aisle is likely to be shorter, as the time to scan items at exit is eliminated. No cashier: an evolution The no-cashier approach has evolved over the past decade and there are multiple variations on the theme. Self checkout has been a staple of grocery stores and drug stores for a while. Customers line up, scan and bag their own items, and pay at the register. An associate mans the aisles from a central terminal and assists if something goes wrong. Then there is the portable scanner model. Scanner devices in the store are connected with a shopper’s account. Customers use these devices to scan items as they put them in their cart and pay for items as they exit. Apple stores use a variation on this approach, with retail associates carrying scanners that enable them to check people out from anywhere in the store. More recently, mobile self-checkout has emerged. Shoppers can use merchant apps on their own mobile devices to scan items and then pay using their device or a credit card at a dedicated aisle near the exit. Order ahead or its variant BOPIS (buy online pick up in store) are becoming increasingly popular among consumers pressed for time and not wanting to spend time looking for items in a physical store and then waiting in a line to checkout. Shoppers buy and pay online and go to the store to collect the items, which have already been bagged by associates. >See also: Technology will revolutionise the retail experience Finally, intelligent self-checkout is the most cutting edge iteration of the cashier-less future. Shoppers check in at the entrance to the store using their mobile device, pick up the items they need, and walk out of the store. Checkout happens automatically, with payments, offers, discounts and coupons applied through a cloud based system directly connected to the shopper’s mobile device. Better for customers, better for stores Cashier-less stores are important for a number of reasons. Perhaps the main one is that it reduces operating costs. There is no need for people to man cash registers. Store associates can instead be deployed within the store, assisting Shoppers with finding items and recommending merchandise. In Starbucks’ case, employees can instead be deployed to make more beverages, thereby increasing the store throughput. In some other cases, the associates can be eliminated completely, though most shoppers visiting a brick and mortar store, still crave human interaction as part of their shopping journey. Smart inventory and dynamic pricing is another benefit. Real time information on the items that are bought or in demand can be combined with predictive algorithms to not only replenish items throughout the day, but also change pricing multiple times a day as a factor of conditions localised to a store level. >See also: The rise, or fall of the retail app? Furthermore, having no cashiers creates smart opportunities to provide customers with information and up-sell. Using self-scanning/checkout apps, shoppers are given information about the products they scan, as well as options around bundles or related items. An often overlooked benefit of cashier-less stores is that they enable retailers to reduce their store footprint. Retailers can house certain popular items in the physical store, but carry a much larger inventory online, which can be delivered to a shoppers home from a nearby warehouse. An omni-channel cart powered by a mobile interface allows the combination of physical, online and virtual goods purchases into a single seamless transaction, ensuring the shopper retains loyalty to the merchant while not worrying about which channel they are getting their goods from. Self-checkout also eliminates the real estate needed for large checkout areas and removes the need for costly cash register hardware and maintenance. While a lot of progress has been made, there is a lot of room to grow. The checkout experience will continue to evolve over time. In quick service restaurants (QSR), order ahead is becoming more common and most large brands are already investing in technologies that can make it smoother. One of the key areas to disrupt is drive-thru – and there are several car based checkout technologies being proposed for it. Pretty soon, you could be pumping gas, and also buying your burger from the fast food store attached to the gas station, while also scheduling your tire rotation at the service centre next door, all by just a couple of clicks on your phone or the display in your car. >See also: Driving retail possibilities and e-commerce with data In addition, checkout will evolve with behavioural and visual intelligence. Through combination of visual recognition engines, sensors, and artificial intelligence, retailers will be better able to detect criminal behaviour and take remedial action. Not only will they just detect, but also predict before a criminal activity could occur. The same systems will be able to track your in-store journey and create contextual alerts that are highly personalised to each Shopper, with a goal to maximise their cart. So maybe that Café 80s scene from Back to the Future was pretty accurate in depicting what we are experiencing today. Fortunately, instead of staring at an old TV screen with a flaky interface, businesses are instead able to use the raw power of mobile computing in our hands, and the sensory feedback of attractive user interfaces within apps. The cashier-less future isn’t just about avoiding long lines—it’s about creating a far more dynamic, convenient, and compelling shopping experience, whether someone is buying toothpaste, a dress, a car, or that hard to find “Pepsi Perfect.”   Sourced by Ashok Narasimhan, CEO of Omnyway   The UK’s largest conference for tech leadership, Tech Leaders Summit, returns on 14 September with 40+ top execs signed up to speak about the challenges and opportunities surrounding the most disruptive innovations facing the enterprise today. Secure your place at this prestigious summit by registering here Related Topics Disruption Omnichannel Retail App Comments (0) Leave a Reply Cancel replyLogin to comment Prev Next Keep Informed by email Subscribe I am happy to receive updates and offers from Information AgeI am happy to receive updates and offers from carefully selected 3rd parties We do not sell or distribute our subscriber details with other companies or individuals for any reason.

This truth is more important to understand than ever since some of us are living in a time when reality is skewed by perceptions shaped by falsehoods from people in power. Donald Trump rode into the White House by pushing the idea that Muslims have a propensity toward terrorism, that African-Americans live in crumbling ghetto war zones, and that Latinos are illegal immigrants who bring crime to communities. If you happen to fall into any of those groups, this stuff gets into your head, even when you try hard to shut it out. Not long ago I was walking out of Walmart with a cart full of goods and the greeter, an elderly white gentleman, stopped me to check my receipt and inspect my cart. "Why me? Why not the white guy behind me or the little old white lady who cruised out in front of me?" I thought to myself. "Is it because of my brown skin and brown hair? Do I just look like someone who would try to sneak a few items through?" Something similar happened at a different store last month. I was rolling my cart down the aisle and an older white lady was, seemingly out of nowhere, super rude and condescending to me. Maybe she was just a jerk. Maybe she was just having a bad day. But I had to wonder if she felt like she could bully me because she was white and I'm not. When you have experiences like these there are two options: (1) Feel bad about others for, potentially, having discriminated against you or (2) Feel bad about yourself for thinking discrimination was involved. (Was I, myself, racially profiling these people by attributing their behaviors to their race or ethnicity?) Either way, you feel bad. These everyday experiences take a toll — sometimes in ways that are completely unexpected. For instance, a recent study published online in the journal Ethnic and Racial Studies found that middle school Latino boys with higher awareness of the Arizona SB1070 "show me your papers" law — had a harder time controlling their classroom behavior than girls with similar knowledge of the law, and boys with less knowledge of the law. There are a few factors at work here. For one, boys are well documented to be less able to control their impulses and behaviors in a classroom setting than are girls. And the authors, researchers at Arizona State University at Tempe, note, "There is a growing psychological literature suggesting that males are more likely to perceive discrimination than females." In general, Latino boys and young men are at higher risk than their white peers and their female peers to fall behind in reading and math. Latino boys, according to the authors, "may already face social pressures that discourage self-regulatory behaviors in academic settings (e.g. peer pressure to appear to not care about school)." Throw onto that pile the specter of upheaval due to possible effects of SB1070 on fragile family structures — i.e. knowing a family member who is living in the country without permission or having a close relative at risk for removal — and the boys themselves reported lower levels of classroom behaviors like being able to follow teacher instructions or stay quiet while others are talking. That fears about deportations breaking up families might have an adverse effect on Latino students isn't shocking. But it is sobering that mere awareness has such an outsize effect. Considering that research from across the country has documented post-election instances of immigration-related bullying and racism in schools, one thing is clear: No border wall has been funded or built, yet Trump's commitment to it will have a lasting negative impact on a growing portion of the country's public school students. — Esther Cepeda's email address is estherjcepeda@washpost.com.   About Us Sign up for daily e-mail Subscribe Reader Services My Profile Reader Services Subscriptions Subscriber controls Contact us Submissions Photos Events Letters to the editor Corrections Announcements Obituaries Story ideas Since you asked Alerts Email Alerts RSS Feeds Text Alerts Advertise Media Kit Home Products and services Ad rates Advertising contacts Mail Tribune Daily Tidings The Nickel Shop Our Valley Blogs Propel Marketing © Copyright 2006-2017 GateHouse Media, LLC.

"[This] suggests that Latino males, many of whom belong to immigrant families themselves or coexist with immigrants in their communities and schools, may be at risk for academic adjustment problems resulting from the enforcement of strict immigration laws," wrote the authors. "Latino males have the highest school dropout [rate] compared to any other group in the U.S.A. (U.S. Department of Education 2014), and thus it is critical that we identify factors that hinder and promote the educational prospects of these youths."

Diedra Laird dlaird@charlotteobserver.com Latest News May 29, 2017 3:57 PM NC’s biggest charity Christmas program is homeless, due to land sale By Mark Price msprice@charlotteobserver.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story One of the largest charity Christmas programs in the Southeast is in jeopardy after losing its home due to Charlotte’s booming real estate market. The Salvation Army has operated its Christmas Center for more than a decade out of a vacant department store owned by Victory Christian Center, which offered the space for free. But not any more. The former Walmart has been sold by its owner, Victory Christian Center, leaving no room for the massive toy distribution program that has served as a model for other charities around the country. Salvation Army officials are now scrambling for a temporary replacement site this Christmas, while a more permanent location is found for 2018. Time is short, too. Major Larry Broome, head of Charlotte’s Salvation Army, says his agency would like to confirm a site this summer, because the process of ordering and storing toys begins months in advance. Registration follows in October, and not long after that, a crew will begin building thousands of bicycles. The building is also home to the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department’s Christmas program, which is hoping to again share whatever site the Salvation Army finds. “My fear is that whatever we find might be smaller, which would mean less people would be helped,” says Broome. “This is a massive program and the space you need for it is not readily available.” There will be a Christmas program no matter what, The Salvation Army promises. But Broome does not have many answers beyond that. Last year, his agency distributed bags of toys to 10,455 children, as well as gifts for low-income seniors. It is considered a national model both for its size and for the fact that it uses volunteer labor and donated toys to keep costs to a minimum. The Charlotte Mecklenburg Police Department’s Christmas program, done in partnership with Explorer Scouts, provided gifts for another 1,700 children out of the building last year. Officer Ryan Botzenmayer of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department says the CMPD Explorers Christmas Project found stability when it partnered with the Salvation Army four years ago, not to mention a reduction in operations costs. “Yes, I’m concerned,” Botzenmayer said. “We’re into May and have no place. There is a lot that goes into these programs and we’re nearly six months into the year...This program affects a lot of people. It would be heartbreaking to lose it.” Salvation Army officials give Victory Christian Center credit for the program’s success in recent years, because it lent the space at no charge. It’s estimated that amounted to $1 million donated to the program in the past decade, Broome said. The building, located near Arrowood and South Boulevard, has reportedly been on the market for a few years. That the property finally sold shows how robust Charlotte’s real estate market is becoming, particularly along the Lynx Light Rail. The tracks are just across the street from the building. A new use for the site has not been disclosed, but it is believed to be destined for offices. Among those advising the Salvation Army are experts in Charlotte’s real estate market. The need, they say, is a site akin to a warehouse, former school or vacant store. It must be 75,000 to 100,000-square-feet, with plenty of parking, public restrooms and access to public transportation. The agency needs it for at least four months. The Salvation Army would prefer to have the space donated. Otherwise, Broome believes the agency will have to raise donated money to pay the rent. Bank of America executive Bill Lorenz is among those in the community helping the Salvation Army in its search. “For me, this is about the magic of Christmas and making sure that over 6,000 families have a chance to celebrate the holidays in a way they could not do themselves,” said Lorenz, who is on the Salvation Army’s advisory board. “I’m hoping someone in the community will step up and help the same way Victory Christian has for a number of years. The one thing we don’t want is to be put in a position of having to downsize the program, and not serve as many families. That is a possibility and it’s a tough spot to be in.” Mark Price: 704-358-5245, @markprice_obs How to help To reach Major Larry Broome with suggestions or offers of help, call 704-334-4731 or email salvationarmycharlotte@uss.salvationarmy.org.

Online shopping an echo of the era of sales via catalogs The Bebe chain of women’s clothing stores is among the latest victims of changing buyer habits. Dreamstime By Suzette Parmley, The Philadelphia Inquirer Published: May 29, 2017, 4:43 PM A   A PHILADELPHIA — In late April, struggling women’s apparel chain Bebe said it was closing all 180 stores — the latest casualty amid a steady stream of defaults, bankruptcies and closures over the last year. While experts say more closures are coming, something else is occurring: The losses of traditional retail jobs are being absorbed by the likes of Amazon, with its new fulfillment centers and warehouses. But shopping is taking a new form, experts say, thanks to the internet. Michael Niemira, principal of the Retail Economist LLC, likened online shopping to the catalog sales of the early 20th century that supplied goods to consumers in areas where stores did not exist. “Today, some communities are losing stores that are not profitable, and the online distribution is filling the gap as catalog sales once did,” he said. The survivors will “stay alert to demographic and shopping trends” with fewer stores. It’s why Target Corp. is going with smaller format stores while investing $7 billion in new IT over the next three years. And it’s why megastore Wal-Mart went on a shopping spree, starting last year, to buy online firms, such as jet.com, to offset its weaknesses. Its latest target, reports suggest, is online men’s fashion retailer Bonobos. Digitally native brands, such as Away, Bonobos and Warby Parker, are creating a new kind of retail store, suggested David Bell, a marketing professor at the Wharton School. It’s a “zero inventory, high-experience store” in which customers enter an amazing space, get a brand experience and buy items that are shipped to them. Information gathering and fulfillment used to occur under one roof, creating the need for large stores to hold all that inventory, Bell said. But that model is fading. “Retail of the future will look more like a Tesla showroom than an old-school dealer lot, with 1,000 cars — except the one that you want — sitting out in the rain,” Bell said. The Philadelphia region’s powerhouse King of Prussia Mall is expected to fare much better in the new world than its competitors on the lower end. Still, David Simon, CEO of the mall’s owner, Simon Property Group, stressed the need for change. “I’m hopeful that retailers will focus on improving their in-store experience, and that could be a lot of different ways,” Simon told analysts earlier this year. “That could be through technology, that could be through a better look and feel.” Richard Hayne, CEO of Urban Outfitters Inc., said the U.S. overbuilt retail space in much the way it did in housing. Retail added too much space in the 1990s and early 2000s, creating “a bubble, and like housing, that bubble has now burst,” he said in a March 2017 earnings call. “We are seeing the results; doors are shuttering and rents retreating.” Retail bankruptcies over the last 12 months are near recession levels, said RBC Capital Markets retail analyst Brian Tunick. These include BCBG, Payless, PacSun and department store closures (45 Macy’s, 140 JC Penneys and 150 Kmart/Sears stores in fiscal 2017). Yet there are hopeful pockets. Growing are value-oriented chains such as Dollar Tree, Dollar General, Ross, and TJX, owner of TJ Maxx and Marshalls, as well as beauty retailer Ulta. Non-store retailers, such as Amazon, run establishments classified as distribution centers, and can augment their workforce with employees from temporary help agencies. Amid the retail carnage, trendy eyewear company Warby Parker, which began online, has been adding stores aggressively. It now has 50 stores. The company said it will open 25 stores this year. Mark Petrie, 50, of Lake George, N.Y., is a longtime Warby customer who knew what he wanted when he stepped into the downtown Philadelphia store on a recent Thursday: big, chunky glasses with black frames. He said he had “been online a million times but it’s hard to try glasses on online.” “That’s why having this store is so great,” said Petrie, a real estate agent. “We don’t have one in Lake George.” “I like instant, total gratification,” he said. And he got it. A pair of $95 Nash glasses with dark, tortoiseshell frames. Then there’s Rosemarie Monzo Mazzeo, a 46-year-old physician. She has bought more items online with Lilly Pulitzer over the last five years, especially on clothes she thinks will sell out. For other stuff, she visits the retailer at King of Prussia Mall. The high-end women’s clothier is adding four to six stores a year and is investing heavily on its website. Fourth quarter sales — which included a significant increase in online sales — went up 26 percent in fiscal year 2016 over the previous year. “It’s like being in an adult candy store with all the beautiful colors and textures,” Mazzeo said of each visit. “It’s a fun experience and it’s become a bonding experience between me and my daughter.” Please take a second to review our community guidelinesCommunity guidelines Blogs Staff Blogs Home All Politics is Local Blazer Banter Brews in Clark Cannabis Chronicles Clark County Faces Digital Desk Family Room Ghost Stories High School Sports HealthBeat History Political Beat Tailgate Talk Community It's the Fair!

She’s been a regular visitor to the Mountainfilm festival here in Telluride, a former mining town that went through hipster rediscovery and has retained something of that spirit in its current upscale incarnation. Hesch approached me in distress. She’s frustrated that she can’t even get to a point of departure for a reasoned discussion with her dad, a strong supporter of President Donald Trump. “What can I do? We can’t even agree on a reality to discuss or a source we both accept,” she said. Like many Trump voters, her father is convinced there’s a liberal plot to sabotage the president. Hesch’s experience is normal. Tens of millions of Trump opponents cannot communicate with tens of millions of his supporters. There is no viable vocabulary. There is no shared reality. This is the chasm to which Fox News, Republican debunking of reason and science, herd-reinforcing social media algorithms, liberal arrogance, rightist bigotry, and an economy of growing inequality have ushered us. It’s perhaps the most important problem confronting the United States, because the end point of hardening fracture and mutual incomprehension is violence — like last week’s fatal stabbing of two men by a Muslim-insulting white supremacist on a Portland, Oregon, commuter train. In New York you never need encounter a Trump supporter. But in Colorado, neither red nor blue but purple, it’s impossible to evade difficult conversations that cut across political lines. The state voted for Hillary Clinton in November with a nearly 5 percent margin over Trump, but he is convinced he could have won; 2020 Trump ads have already appeared. Colorado is in play. Echoes from Trump supporters coalesce in my mind: God put us on this land and now we’re not allowed to make a profit as a result of all the environmental regulations and I have to subdivide and sell out while the welfare queens collect handouts because they’re too lazy to work. Or this: People have to choose between heating their homes, buying food or buying health care and you want them to worry about the survival of the planet or transgender stuff? I respect business and I distrust government. That’s the American way. I don’t want illegal immigrants taking our jobs. I don’t like liberals who shop at Whole Foods talking down their noses at me because I shop at Wal-Mart. White lives matter, too, you know. That woman forgot that — and lost. We lost our discipline and our moral code in this country. So we need honest Trump to shake things up. And this: We need God back in our schools. We can’t just condone anything our kids do. Nobody’s gonna run God or guns out of our country. I don’t want anybody telling me I can’t defend myself. I don’t want to take a knife to a gunfight. Don’t tell me I can’t have a gun if the crooks have one. It’s a matter of taking care of myself. If this country ever told me I couldn’t have a gun, I’d be out in the streets. These are composites from Trump World. It’s important to hear people out. That’s democracy: listening to what people say. There are hateful racists among Trump supporters; there are also many decent, thoughtful, anxious, patriotic Americans who felt they were losing some part of their country’s essence. The liberal complacency that holds that these people simply need to be “educated” is self-defeating. If that’s what the Democratic Party exudes — coastal complacency — it will lose, just like Clinton did last year. As Abe Streep, a journalist and writer based in Montana, put it to me: “Nobody’s ever been convinced by being made to feel stupid.” I spoke to Alexandra Arboleda, a lawyer in Phoenix, who was elected last year to the board of the Central Arizona Water Conservation District. She’s a Democrat in a Republican county and a woman who feels strongly about climate change in an area where such convictions encounter hostility. “You have to be more receptive and see where people who don’t think like you come from,” she said. “Most people are concerned about climate change. But where in Telluride that might be priority number one, with Republicans it’s down the list. So you have to adjust. Instead of talking about sustainability and climate change — words that set them off — talk pragmatically about drought conservation plans. Persuade them that increasing irrigation efficiency at a time of the longest drought in recorded history on the Colorado River System benefits everyone from farms to downstream city users. It’s doable. But you have to curb the liberal arrogance that’s out there.” America needs the conversations it’s not having. They start, for both sides, with listening. The alternative is bloody confrontation.
