College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Wal-Mart Tries Its Hand at Stunt Food With the Crotilla It's exactly what you think it is (croissant plus tortilla), and the company hopes you will be intrigued. Daniel B. Kline (TMFDankline) Apr 27, 2017 at 9:40AM There was a time when during "sweeps" rating periods -- a time once crucial to setting ad rates -- television shows would "stunt cast" just to get attention. That might mean the regular cast inexplicably bumping into one of the stars of the day (hey, it's Mr. T!). or even whole stunt episodes built around the surviving Gilligan's Island cast, or some of the The Brady Bunch showing up. In general, catchphrases would be said, laugh tracks were turned up to 11, and viewers would be happily duped into watching. The restaurant world has borrowed that phenomenon for stunt food. Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX) recently did it with the Unicorn Frappuccino, and chains like Burger King and Taco Bell have made events out of mashing up their menu staples with various snack chips. Stunt food, however, has become common enough that just because a chain tries something wacky does not mean the American public will care. For every Unicorn Frappuccino-level hit, there are at least a handful of Jack in the Box Brunchfasts or Burger King Satisfries that simply do not work. Even Starbucks struggled to establish a viral sensation with a stunt food offer. The chain tried numerous times before its Unicorn Frappuccino became a hit with equally ridiculous frozen drinks offered for a short time that simply did not connect with customers. Now, Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), a company that's hardly at the cutting edge of hip, has decided to take its own try at stunt food, launching what it calls the "Crotilla," which blends a croissant with a tortilla. The Crotilla is a cross between a croissant and a tortilla. Image source: Wal-Mart. What is Wal-Mart doing? The retailer is clearly trying to get attention with its new croissant/tortilla hybrid as it launched the product with a blog post headlined "Best Flatbread 4Evr: Meet the Crotilla, Your Bakery BFF." In the post, written by Wal-Mart Communications staff member Elizabeth Walker, the company says the bakery item "can be used for everything from breakfast sandwiches to Indian food." Wal-Mart clearly wants to push boundaries while staying familiar, which is not unlike what various Yum! Brands (NYSE: YUM) chains have done with their stunt food. When Taco Bell makes a taco out of Doritos or Pizza Hut stuffs hot dogs in its crust, it's different and people take notice, but it's also easy-to-understand for consumers. "We wanted to invent something innovative and exclusive to Wal-Mart. We worked with our supplier, Aryzta, to create a mash-up of two products the customer already understands, the croissant and the tortilla, similar to the Cronut sensation a few years back," Wal-Mart senior buyer Bradlee Underwood told Walker. Crotillas will be baked in Wal-Mart's bakeries each day. Underwood made it very clear what the business goal of the product is. "We know customers, especially millennial customers, are hungry for new food trends and cool ways to experience food, and we want to be a destination for that," he said. Will this work? Wal-Mart is jumping on a trend and loudly announcing that that's what it's doing. If the Crotilla tastes good, people may buy it. It's possible that existing Wal-Mart customers will be intrigued by the mash-up bakery item, but it's unlikely this will become a sensation that lures in new shoppers. Still, this is not a bad idea for Wal-Mart, though it's a sort of clumsy execution. It's not particularly hip to have a marketing team brazenly try to attach your brand to whatever the young kids like now. But sometimes it takes a lot of swings to hit a home run. If Wal-Mart builds a reputation for coming up with fun, new stuff, perhaps eventually the elusive millennial audience will come try it.

Tech Apple Science Cars Samsung Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 Nintendo NES     NES Classic Stock Arrived At Target And Walmart Stores Saturday Posted: Apr 29 2017, 9:00am CDT | by Luigi Lugmayr, in News | Technology News     Buy This Now On Amazon Saturday morning Walmart and Target stores are flagged to have the NES Classic in stock. Updated. The discontinued NES Classic Edition is in stock at over 180 Walmart stores and over 250 Targets stores on Saturday. There are many new stores flagged to have the NES Classic in stock this morning that have not shown NES stock yesterday. Especially a lot more Target stores have been flagged to have the NES Classic in stock today.  Don't Miss: Find a Nintendo NES Classic in stock iStockNow issued in stock alerts for Walmart and Target stores across the Nation. We have cross referenced the iStockNow alerts with the BrickSeek. On BrickSeek stores are also showing the NES Classic units in stock at select stores. We also checked the flagged stores on walmart.com, but Walmart's inventory search does not show the NES inventory. Target and Walmart have been restocking the NES Classic since mid-week. New NES Classic stock is keeps arriving on the weekend. It all is likely over by Monday, May 1. Although we heard whispers that GameStop stores still expect NES Classic consoles to arrive next week. Reseller prices for the NES Classic keep dropping again due to the arrival of new NES Classic stock. The lowest priced Nintendo NES Classic console sells for $259.99 plus shipping on amazon.com. A trip to your local Walmart store can mean a $200 saving or profit, depending on which side you are in the NES hunting game.  The reseller prices have been over $300 a week ago, right after the announcement that Nintendo stops making the NES Classic. Now prices came down quite a bit amidst the new NES Classic Edition stock. This will change as soon as all stores run dry of the Nintendo NES Classic. Nintendo said that there are still new NES Classic consoles coming in April to retailers. Best Buy had a big NES Classic sale on Monday. The only other stores that offer the NES Classic this week are Amazon Prime Now and the Nintendo Flagship store in New York. Today could be the last day the Nintendo store is offering the NES Classic.  The $59.99 Nintendo NES Classic Edition console launched on November 11 in stores and online. The supply was extremely constraint in stores and especially online. On April 13, Nintendo announced to stop production of the NES Classic Edition. The last shipments of the NES Classic arrive through April. The palm-sized NES console, retailing for $59.99 list price, features the classic Nintendo NES controller many geeks have grown up with. The retro console comes pre-installed with 30 classic NES games including Super Mario Bros., Pac-Man, Metroid, Donkey Kong, The Legend of Zelda and Kirby's Adventures. The NES Classic Edition system is a miniaturized version of the groundbreaking NES, originally released in 1985. The ability to mod the NES Classic and install an unlimited number of games has renewed the hype around the retro console. The latest hack enables the NES Classic to store 2,500 games. The 80s retro console launched on November 11, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, Nintendo has sold 1.5 million NES Classic Edition. Nintendo ha not announced NES Classic sales numbers in the company's April 27 earnings call. Read the latest Nintendo NES Classic updates. This story may contain affiliate links.

Yunus Lasania File photo. Wal-Mart ,which currently has 21 operational stores in India, will also open another 50 stores during the same period. Photo: Bloomberg Hyderabad: Retail giant Wal-Mart India Pvt. Ltd, a subsidiary of Wal-Mart Stores Inc., signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the government of Telangana on Saturday to set up 10 cash-and-carry stores across the state in the next five years. The company, which currently has 21 operational stores in India, will also open another 50 stores during the same period, said company executives. “Ten stores is a big commitment. Four of them will be set-up in Hyderabad, while the others will come up in districts of Karimnagar, Nizamabad and other places,” said Krish Iyer, president and CEO, Wal-Mart India. The company will invest between $10 to 12 million per store. Dirk Van den Berghe, executive vice-president and president and CEO, Wal-Mart-Canada and Asia, who was also present at the event, said that the retail giant wants to invest more in local communities and it has a presence in 28 countries across the world. “The state under the leadership of the Chief Minister will also bring out a new retail policy soon to do business easily. It will have a heavy focus on better facilitation and speedy clearances,” said Telangana information technology (IT) minister K.T. Rama Rao. He added that Wal-Mart’s forte is to start new stores in Tier-2 and 3 cities or small places. Rao also mentioned that the state government will soon establish farmer organisations, and hoped that Wal-Mart India can also help small marginal farmers across Telangana. “We see double-digit growth in India in the coming days. The retail sector is a $600 billion sector of which 8% organised trade and 92% traditional trade,” Rajneesh Kumar, senior vice-president and head, corporate affairs, Wal-Mart India. Around 92 % of the retail industry comprises ‘Kirana’ stores, which Wal-Mart India with its cash and carry model is looking to serve them, said Kumar. “There are a lot of approvals to set-up new stores. Ideally it takes us 2 to 3 years to start a new one. If there is a good retail policy, then the time can be crunched,” he added. The first and only Wal-Mart cash and carry store was opened in Hyderabad in 2012. Metro Cash and Carry India Pvt. Ltd, the local arm of the German retailer, has 23 stores in India and plans to open 50 stores by 2020, increasing its share of the $2-billion organized wholesale cash and carry market, its CEO Arvind Mediratta told Mint in an interview in March.

Tech Apple Science Cars Samsung Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 Nintendo NES     NES Classic In Stock The Last Day Posted: Apr 30 2017, 2:12am CDT | by Luigi Lugmayr, in News | Technology News     The last day of the Nintendo NES Classic Edition arrived. Here is where the Nintendo NES Classic Edition is in stock. Nintendo sold 2.3 million NES Classic Editions, before calling it quits. This number was not high enough by far and there are still lots of consumers who would like to buy a NES Classic, but can't. Don't Miss: This is How to Find a Nintendo Switch in Stock Nintendo said when the company announced to discontinue the NES Classic that the last shipments arrive at retailer through April. April ends today. Sunday is the official last day to find a NES Classic in stock for regular $59.99.  People who still seek a NES Classic can be still hopeful to find a NES Classic in a store. New NES Classic inventory has been rolling into Target and Walmart stores across the Nation on Saturday. As of 3am ET the situation does not look that bright yet, but this can still change in the next hours. Shoppers need to keep their eyes focused on NES Classic inventory trackers. iStockNow tracks over 60 Target stores and 160 Walmart stores that have the NES Classic in stock. This is much lower than on Saturday, but as said this can still change. It is recommended to cross check the iStockNow alerts with BrickSeek (Walmart), BrickSeek (Target) to increase the likelihood that the information is correct. Checking a flagged store on walmart.com would make sense too, but for some reason Walmart's inventory search does not show the NES inventory. The demand for the NES Classic is extremely high, topping that for the Nintendo Switch. The competition to line up first at a store and get hands on the few NES Classic in stock is fierce. The influx of new NES Classic inventory has even pushed down the reseller prices well under $300. Legit reseller offers can be found on amazon.com for around $270. Prices have been already above $300 right after the controversial announcement of discontinuing the NES Classic. The NES Classic Edition has not been on sale online since weeks. Only Amazon Prime Now offered the NES Classic regularly, but that is coming also to a halt. Yesterday only San Diego had a very brief availability. Some people reported on social media that they found a NES Classic in stock at GameStop. We recommend to also visit GameStop locations to check if the store has received new NES Classic inventory. The NES Classic has surfaced at Amazon stores in Europe briefly on Friday. The NES Classic appeared on Amazon France and Amazon Italy. NES hunters should keep their eyes peeled at all options including import opportunities from retailers in Europe or Asia. The $59.99 Nintendo NES Classic Edition console launched on November 11 in stores and online. The supply was extremely constraint in stores and especially online. On April 13, Nintendo announced to stop production of the NES Classic Edition. The last shipments of the NES Classic arrive through April. The palm-sized NES console, retailing for $59.99 list price, features the classic Nintendo NES controller many geeks have grown up with. The retro console comes pre-installed with 30 classic NES games including Super Mario Bros., Pac-Man, Metroid, Donkey Kong, The Legend of Zelda and Kirby's Adventures. The NES Classic Edition system is a miniaturized version of the groundbreaking NES, originally released in 1985. The ability to mod the NES Classic and install an unlimited number of games has renewed the hype around the retro console. The latest hack enables the NES Classic to store 2,500 games. The 80s retro console launched on November 11, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, Nintendo has sold 1.5 million NES Classic Edition. Nintendo ha not announced NES Classic sales numbers in the company's April 27 earnings call. Read the latest Nintendo NES Classic updates. This story may contain affiliate links.

(WATE) – The wife and family of a 23-year-old man shot and killed at a Walmart in Clinton, Tennessee, on Friday spoke out for the first time. Marshal Pinsly’s wife Crystal says her husband was a great father and loved spending time with his children. “He was everything to me… to us,” said Crystal. Marshal has a 10-month-old daughter with Crystal. He also has a 4-year-old daughter and three step-children, who Crystal says he raised as his own. RELATED: Tennessee man accused of killing ex-wife’s new husband at Walmart “He was a great father. He was a wonderful husband. All he did was make everyone laugh. It was hard to be upset with him.” Crystal says she knew when she met Marshal they were meant to be. She remembers his smile most of all. Marshal’s aunt, Pam Covey, said her nephew was a great man. “Marshal was the kind of guy who loved cars, loved his kids, loved his wife,” she said. Marshal’s family and friends gathered Saturday night to memorialize him. They left photos, released balloons, and shared a moment of silence in his honor in the parking lot of the Walmart in Clinton. “We just loved him so much. To even think that that was self defense. There are several other ways that could’ve been taken care of besides killing my husband,” said Crystal. The family is asking for donations to offset funeral costs through a GoFundMe campaign. The investigation is ongoing, according to Clinton police.

There's another option now. At the Wal-Mart in Beaumont, and soon H-E-B and Kroger as well, you can place your order online, drive to the store and have your purchases out front waiting to be loaded. These companies aren't doing this because they want to. They're doing it because they have to. Online shopping at Amazon.com and other web sites is taking a larger share of retail commerce every year. It's getting to the point that many stores are struggling to survive, from mom-and-pop shops to national chains. The companies mentioned in the first paragraph have decided to fight back instead of passively watching their sales dwindle. Many other businesses in Southeast Texas need to do the same. They should be guided by three key points: This is real. It's not going away, and the internet may be your biggest competitor. Most business owners and managers realize this, but a surprising number do not. They think they can get by with business as usual - or cut their way to profitability by reducing hours or staff. They are wrong, and some of them will not survive. Invest now in better technology and ways to interact with your customers. If you don't have a web presence or social media accounts, get them. Whether those links make the sale or get customers to your store, they can help significantly. You can't rely on technology exclusively, but you can't ignore it either. Be more aggressive in growing our community and marketing to local residents. When you sponsor a Little League team or allow a bake sale in front of your store, you're helping the region and yourself. And this may sound self-serving, but you have to advertise more on traditional media like local radio, television and newspapers, both print and digital. This is one irreplaceable way you can reach potential customers, and it's something that nationwide websites don't do. Tell more about what you offer. A lot of people don't know and would buy from you if they did. Unlike Amazon, local businesses provide jobs and sales taxes that help people right here. If these companies go away, this region won't be the same, or as livable. ----------------------------------- This is our opinion; what is your's?

STR/AFP/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption STR/AFP/Getty Images Bangladeshi activists mark the fourth anniversary of the Rana Plaza building collapse at the site where the building once stood in Savar, on the outskirts of Dhaka, on April 24. STR/AFP/Getty Images On April 24, 2013, the eight-story Rana Plaza building outside Dhaka, Bangladesh, collapsed, killing more than 1,100 people and injuring thousands of others. At the time, the building housed five garment factories that manufactured goods for major retail companies in Europe and North America. It is considered the deadliest disaster in the garment industry. The causes included shoddy construction, a building with too many floors and too much heavy equipment for the structure to withstand. The incident shook Bangladesh's $28 billion garment industry, the second largest in the world behind China. It drew attention to horrific conditions for factory employees, and raised questions about transparency in the global garment industry in which they work. Planet Money The Tragic Number That Got Us All Talking About Our Clothing But four years later, a report on supply chain transparency released by Human Rights Watch finds only 17 of 72 apparel and footwear companies contacted by a coalition of labor and human rights groups and global unions have agreed to implement a transparency pledge by the end of this year. The Apparel and Footwear Supply Chain Transparency Pledge sets a minimum industry-wide standard for supply chain disclosure, says Aruna Kashyap, senior counsel in the Women's Rights Division of Human Rights Watch and co-author of the report. The pledge was drafted and endorsed last year by a nine-member coalition, which includes Human Rights Watch, the International Labor Rights Forum and International Trade Union Confederation, and requires companies to disclose twice a year all the sites that manufacture their products, including details such as addresses, types of products made and number of workers at each site. Limited progress In the aftermath of the Rana Plaza tragedy, the Bangladeshi government rushed to improve safety measures, and human rights and labor advocates called for greater accountability and transparency in the industry. Last year, 38 people were charged with murder in the building collapse. Government labor reforms regarding workers' rights and pay and factory compliance have been put in place. But "in terms of effectiveness, there remains a gap," Khondaker Golam Moazzem, research director with the Centre for Policy Dialogue in Dhaka, recently told The Daily Star, a Dhaka-based newspaper.

Munir Uz Zaman/AFP/Getty Images Two major agreements between global retailers and brands and trade unions – the Accord on Fire and Building Safety in Bangladesh and the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety – were also signed after the tragedy. The organizations in charge of these initiatives released statements this month indicating they had made progress, but there was still more work to be done. Kashyap says that even though global apparel companies don't directly employ workers in Bangladesh, they do own and sell brands that have business relationships with the factories that employ those workers. And it's transparency about those relationships — knowing which factories are producing for which brands being sold by which parent company — that is important, she says. Goats and Soda Study: Child Laborers In Bangladesh Are Working 64 Hours A Week Companies such as Nike, Patagonia and H&M Group are among the 17 committing to adhere to the transparency pledge by the end of 2017. Others, such as Columbia Sportswear and the Walt Disney Co., which publish names and addresses of supplier factories, are acknowledged in the report as moving "in the right direction." Companies listed in the "No Commitment to Publish Supplier Factory Information" category include Hugo Boss, Mango and Walmart. "The labor movement, over decades, has been demanding that parent companies have to publish their supplier information," says Kashyap. While many international retailers have been reporting that information in some capacity over the years, she says, it's been inconsistent. Kashyap says the Rana Plaza tragedy was a wake-up call because no one knew immediately which companies were sourcing clothing from the building at the time of its collapse. "And so [investigators] had to actually go through the ruins to collect labels or interview surviving workers ... to hold these brands accountable," says Kashyap. In the end, major apparel companies from the U.S. and Europe, including Children's Place, Mango and Premier Clothing, were found to have had recent orders in factories at Rana Plaza. 'It does matter to consumers' The Two-Way Factory Fire In Bangladesh Kills At Least 21 After Rana Plaza, which came on the heels of two other deadly factory fires — one in Pakistan and the other also in Bangladesh — Kashyap says no parent company in the garment industry should still be resisting transparency, but many are. There are many reasons a company might not want to sign the transparency pledge, Kashyap says, including fears of competitive disadvantage and anti-competition concerns. Some companies, such as Walmart, won't sign the transparency pledge because they already have their own transparency mechanisms in place. "Walmart is working to improve transparency around our supply chain through a number of initiatives," Marilee McInnis, a spokeswoman for Walmart, told NPR via email. But Kashyap says even when companies implement their own measures, it may not be enough. "We're not saying that those systems should not be in place," says Kashyap. "What we're saying is that there are clear limitations to those systems and what transparency does complements everything else you have." Another reason that so few companies have signed the pledge so far could be because, historically, factory lists have been viewed as proprietary information, says Sharon Waxman, president of the Fair Labor Association, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit that brings together brand suppliers and labor rights groups with the goal of improving workers' rights. But agreements like the transparency pledge are still very important and they matter to consumers, says Waxman. She notes that many of the companies that have signed the pledge are members of her organization. "I think consumers, if they have a choice to buy from a brand or supplier that has a very high level of labor standard compared to another one, the price being the same — I think it does matter to consumers," she says. "And if you step back and look at the spread of laws and regulations that are demanding and requiring more transparency in supply chains. I think that really speaks to the level of interest of consumers." While the transparency pledge has no real enforcement mechanism, Waxman says once a company is on the record saying it's going to disclose more information about its supply chain, this will lead to greater accountability. 'They didn't know who to reach out to' The Two-Way 3 Years Later, Bangladeshi Survivors Remember The Collapse Of Rana Plaza More transparency would also send a strong message to workers in the industry, says Kashyap of Human Rights Watch. Bangladesh's garment industry is huge: According to the Clean Clothes Campaign, an alliance of non-governmental organizations and trade unions in the garment industry, it employs between 3.5 million to 4 million people and accounts for about 12 percent of Bangladesh's GDP. Since the Rana Plaza collapse, Bangladeshis have become increasingly vocal in demanding better wages and working conditions. The country's minimum wage is just 32 cents an hour. When tens of thousands of workers walked off the job to protest low wages at the end of last year, it resulted in a week-long shutdown of more than 50 factories outside Dhaka. But after Rana Plaza, some refused to go back to work in the industry. Kashyap has been in touch with some of them, and wrote this month about one Rana Plaza survivor's ongoing struggle with depression and trauma. "One of the things that she said was that she didn't know — a lot of workers didn't know — who they were producing for," Kashyap says.

The two-day Cannabis Canada Forum was organized by licensed marijuana producers and was intended to educate the public about products and business opportunities in the soon-to-be-legal marijuana market. Executives from Hydropothecary, a licensed medical marijuana producer located half an hour from Ottawa in Masson-Angers, Que., were among the keynote speakers during the weekend forum. Shane Morris, one of the company's vice-presidents, said Hydropothecary expects Canada's recreational market will be worth between $5 and 8 billion when marijuana is legalized. "Where we're seeing [regarding] our own potential here in the Gatineau-Ottawa region is we'll be in a position to grow and meet that need, take a portion of that market, and be able to reinvest into jobs, growth and development here in our facility," Morris said. He said Hydropothecary's experience under the stringent medical marijuana licensing system will allow them to handle whatever regulatory burdens come with legalization. The federal government will regulate producers, while the provinces will set out the rules around distribution and sales. The company is focused on its innovations in dry marijuana products and building an up-market clientele. "From an Ottawa perspective, we're more of a Farm Boy, rather than some of the bigger producers, who are more of a Walmart," Morris said. The 'build-out' is happening now The conference also featured businesses other than producers, including information centres, security firms and construction companies. Brent Glesby, a manager at Edmonton-based Thermo Design Insulation, came to the conference because his company — which engineers and builds walls that allow for climate control that conforms with food safety standards — is expanding into the marijuana market. "There's a lot of construction projects going on. The build-out of this industry is happening right now," Glesby said. "There seems to be a lot of money and finance coming into the indsutry."  His company has already done work with four licensed producers in British Columbia, New Brunswick and Toronto, he said. Drew Emmer, from Minnesota's Boveda, said he expects the cannabis market to dwarf his company's current business in cigar humidors and humidity-control systems for musical instruments. "The opportunity worldwide in the cannabis business is just remarkable," he said. "There's plenty of room for everyone to get involved." Boveda sells packages that keep cannabis flowers from losing humidity during transportation or storage. Emmer said licensed producers began approaching the company, saying they used their product — which inspired them to create a custom container. 'Let's not blow it' Saturday's conference also included a focus on social responsibility and the legal issues around marijuana use. Ottawa Police Service Supt. Paul Johnston gave a keynote speech outlining some of the concerns from the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police. Johnston said police are worried about the section of the bill that would permit households to grow up to four cannabis plants, as well as the possibility that legalization could cause an increase in drug-impaired driving. However, he noted that commercial production could have some positive effects. "If it's commercialized properly, it will help eliminate or reduce the black market. And that's one of the good things," Johnston told CBC News. He said police want to emphasize the importance of responsible production, distribution and sale of marijuana. "The Government of Canada has ... given everybody here an opportunity with cannabis,"Johnston said. "Let's not blow it."

Aloha Mayor, Q: I am extremely worried about the future of Maui with a huge influx of illegal Mexican immigrants and the homeless population from the mainland (given one-way tickets from the city that is ridding itself of them). My husband and children are of Hawaiian/Japanese blood. I worked in migrant farm education while finishing my master’s degree—the drugs, gang violence and abuse of the welfare system are outrageous. We have a huge local population that could be assisted with these funds—I am scared for our future on Maui. At least 20% of the population in Target, Ross and Walmart are from Mexico. I am by no means prejudiced—I am just worried about the impact this group will have on the job market, taking away jobs from our local population because they don’t pay taxes and can undercut them. ADVERTISEMENT Please address these issues—please. With aloha… A: You raise several broad-ranging questions that span a variety of jurisdictions, agencies and oversight. I have not heard of a “huge influx” of illegal immigrants from Mexico or elsewhere, but if that were the case, we would rely on federal immigration officials to monitor and enforce existing laws. It should be noted that over several generations, Hawai‘i has seen waves of migrants from around the world who came here to work, such as on the sugar cane plantations—which may be the reason your husband’s Japanese family members came here. My own great-grandparents came here from Okinawa to farm. In today’s economy, even with our current low unemployment rate we sometimes rely on legal immigrants who are willing to take service jobs that others may not want to apply for. And when it comes to families living on the beach with children, we do not discriminate in our offer to help them find shelter and services. My own great-grandparents came here from Okinawa to farm.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Why It's Better to Stay Invested, Even When the Market Is Unpredictable The market is full of volatility, and huge drops are known to happen, but it’s still best for investors to buy and hold through it all. Motley Fool Staff Apr 30, 2017 at 5:30PM It can be tempting to try to time the market, and get out before the crashes and recessions, but there's a mountain of research that suggests it's much better for investors to fight that urge and stay invested. In this clip from Industry Focus: Tech, Motley Fool analysts Dylan Lewis and David Kretzmann go over some of that research and explain why it's so important to stay invested for years at a time, and not try to miss bad days or months. Also, they talk about the best thing an investor can do for their returns, and how investors should feel about buying into a bull market like this, where so many companies look a bit overvalued compared to their average prices. A full transcript follows the video. This video was recorded on April 21, 2017. Dylan Lewis: I think a couple things that underpin why it's better to stay invested, even with the unpredictability of the market. There's a ton of volatility out there. Since 1928 -- this is a stat that I love -- the S&P 500 has lost 20% or more in six years -- 1930, 1931, 1937, 1974, 2002, and 2008. Aside from Great Depression years, in the following year of each 20% drop, the market has roared back with 25% or more return. So, the good and bad tend to follow each other very closely.  If you look at things on an individual basis, as well, JPMorgan puts out this guide to retirement every year, it's kind of an overview of asset allocation, different strategies, and they also looked at the impact of staying fully invested versus missing certain days in the market. Over 1996 to 2015, missing the 40 best days in the market takes your returns negative if you had been invested in the S&P 500, and six of the ten best days for the market during that period were within two weeks of the ten worst days. So, individually picking and looking at these individual indicators can be really difficult, and oftentimes the market tends to flip very quickly. Again, getting to timing, it's really difficult to nail that down. David Kretzmann: Yeah. If you're hesitant to buy today, you have to figure out, what would make you a buyer of stocks? Would it be after a 10% drop? A 15% drop? A 30% drop? What are you waiting for to be a net buyer of stocks? And making that kind of timing decision is incredibly difficult. That's why you have great investors like Warren Buffett and Peter Lynch who say, "Do not do market timing, it's probably the worst thing you can do for your future returns as an investor." Often, psychologically, when the market is down 8%, you might think, "Oh, I'm just going to wait until it's down a little bit more, I'm going to wait for it to recover a little bit," and you get into these mind games where you're hurting your future returns, because making that timing decision of both when to buy and when to sell, it just raises the probability that you're going to mess up somewhere along the line. As you've outlined in a nice way, Dylan, the key is to be invested through the good and the bad times. I know later in the show, we'll talk about some different ways that you can invest in a way that you're still comfortable and you're sleeping well at night, which is what you should do.  But the best thing you can do as an investor, the main advantages you have, here at the Fool, we believe, first, in, investing in individual companies. So, you have to factor that in. You're not necessarily buying an index fund, or buying a whole collection of companies. You're focusing on individual businesses. As an individual investor, your main advantages are, you can try to find and invest in and hold the greatest businesses out there -- the Apples, the Alphabets, the Facebooks, the Amazons, those kinds of companies -- and then you can also hold for a really long time. On Wall Street, the average holding period for a stock is now less than six months. Back in 1960, it was over eight years. The average holding period for a stock today is weeks or months. But, as an individual investor, you can say, "I'm just going to tune out that short-term noise. I want to invest in great businesses. I don't care about what's going to happen over the next year or two, I'm more interested in, what is Amazon or Facebook or Apple going to look like in 10 or 15 years, not what they're going to look like in the next year." So, as an investor, the best thing you can do is lengthen your holding period, or your time horizon. Our former Fool colleague Morgan Housel has done some incredible research on this, looking back at historical S&P 500 data going back to 1870. He found, if you had held a stock for one year, basically looking at every incremental one-year period going back to 1871, if you just held for one year, it's basically like flipping a coin. One year you will be up, one year you'll be down. It's flipping a coin, basically gambling, if you're just trying to predict where things are going to go where things are going to go over the next year. But if you lengthen that out to five years, 10 years, 20 years, the odds of you making money at the end of those longer holding periods increases each time. There's actually been no 20 year period that if you had bought and held the S&P 500 over 20 years where you lost money. That's after inflation. That includes the Great Depression, it includes the Great Recession. Really, the message there is, the No. 1 best thing you can do as an investor to guarantee higher returns is to lengthen your time horizon.  Lewis: You talked about investing in individual companies. I think that's something that can get lost in the huge macro stories we see. Very often, will something that is a sweeping macro issue really impact a company like Facebook? The fundamentals that underlie the businesses that you're investing in probably aren't touched all that much by something like rising interest rates. Yes, it will at least be something that impacts of broad market, but they still have the user growth they have, they still have the base of advertisers that are happy to put stuff on their platform. So, you have to remember that you're investing in the individual business, and while it's scary that there might be some rumors circulating about cataclysmic stuff going on in the market, the fundamentals of that business are really what's underpinning your investment. Kretzmann: Definitely. Within the Odyssey II portfolio in Supernova that I head up with a team of a few other Fools, I will admit that we are having a harder time finding glaring bargains with individual companies right now. Stocks are, for the most part, more expensive than they typically are. You get outside of your comfort level a little bit. But we're tasked every month with managing this real money portfolio, and we have to make a purchase every month. The approach we take there is just focusing on the individual businesses. We'll build up positions in companies over time. I think at a time like this, you want to build positions in companies that you'll be comfortable adding to if they go on sale 20%, if they go down 20% to 40%. So, maybe that's Amazon, maybe it's Alphabet. Whatever it is, companies that you feel pretty confident will be around over the next 10-15 years, companies that are generating strong cash flow, maybe they pay a dividend, maybe you start with a small position and then say, "You know what? I would actually really be happy if I could buy this company for a 30% discount, because I don't care where it'll be in a year or two. I'm more interested in the next five to 10 years or more." Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

It's not yet clear whether a recent ad boycott of YouTube will be short-lived or the start of a long-term shift away from the video service - one that could undercut Google's growth and that of its corporate parent, Alphabet Inc. Alphabet's first-quarter results, released Thursday, provided few clues.  YouTube's inability to keep big-brand ads off unsavory videos is threatening to transform a rising star in Google's digital family into a problem child, although it's not yet clear whether a recent ad boycott of YouTube will be short-lived or the start of a long-term shift away from the video service THE AD BOYCOTT  Advertisers began to flee YouTube last month, after The Times in London and other media outlets turned up evidence that their brands were appearing alongside clips promoting terrorism and racism. The findings alerted advertisers that YouTube didn't have adequate technology or staffing to shield brands from some of the appalling material that gets posted on a site that receives 400 hours of video per minute. At one point, about 250 advertisers were boycotting YouTube. (Some also stepped back from a related system that Google operates to place commercials next to videos on outside websites.) The list included big-spending marketers such as PepsiCo, Wal-Mart Stores, Starbucks, AT&T, Verizon, Johnson & Johnson, and Volkswagen.    Major advertisers didn't start pulling their money from YouTube until the three-month period was nearly over. However, it was good news for Alphabet Inc's non-advertising business, which houses its cloud unit, Pixel smartphones and the Play store. It has long been sandwiched between Google's advertising juggernaut and its moonshot ventures that have captured popular imagination. Not any more. The business, categorized as 'Other Revenue' in its earnings report, posted a 49.4 percent jump in revenue to $3.10 billion on Thursday - a sum already bigger than Twitter Inc's annual revenue. The business now represents about 13 percent of Alphabet's total revenue, compared with 10 percent a year earlier. That may not be a big jump but definitely shines a light on Google's efforts to cut down its dependence on revenue from advertising, where it competes with Facebook Inc. The company's earnings rose 29 percent to $5.4 billion while revenue climbed 22 percent to $24.8 billion.  Shares surged nearly 5 percent, to $933, in Thursday's extended trading. 'In Q1, our largest growth in headcount and capital expenditure was in cloud,' Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai said on a call with analysts on Thursday. Amazon's cloud business grew 43 percent to $3.66 billion in the first quarter. Microsoft's cloud unit grew 93 percent. 'We believe Google will continue to gain traction in the cloud market, and when combined with Google Play and sales of Google's hardware products, we see Google's 'other' revenue growing 38 percent to nearly $14 billion in 2017,' Morningstar analyst Ali Mogharabi wrote in a client note.

Share this article Share However, it was good news for Alphabet Inc's non-advertising business, which houses its cloud unit, Pixel smartphones and the Play store. The company's hardware business also started gaining traction after Google released a pair of high-profile hardware products last year - the Pixel phone and the Google Home, a smart speaker like Amazon's Echo. But the fallout from the YouTube boycott is likely to be felt through the rest of this year.  Skittish advertisers have curtailed their spending until they are convinced Google can prevent their brands from appearing next to extremist clips promoting hate and violence. 'There is no entity in the world that is more risk averse than a senior marketing person,' says Larry Chiagouris, a marketing professor at Pace University in New York. Google CEO Sundar Pichai told analysts during a Thursday review of the first quarter that the company has had 'thousands and thousands' of conversations with advertisers as YouTube takes steps to protect their brands. 'They don't want to go with a media choice that presents problems for a brand, and they don't have to because they have many other choices.' Google CEO Sundar Pichai told analysts during a Thursday review of the first quarter that the company has had 'thousands and thousands' of conversations with advertisers as YouTube takes steps to protect their brands.  'We are evolving overall to a better place,' Pichai said. At another point, he assured analysts that YouTube is still experiencing 'extraordinary' growth without providing specifics. Even if YouTube continues to lose advertisers, it won't leave a huge dent in Alphabet's earnings.  That's because marketers are expected to keep feeding the company's golden goose - Google's dominant search engine.  Ads appearing alongside the billions of search results Google churns out each day still generate most of Alphabet's revenue even as it expands into other fields. Experts say the results show Google's efforts to cut down its dependence on revenue from advertising, where it competes with Facebook Inc, are working But ad spending has been accelerating at a rapid pace on YouTube over the past two years as brands sought to connect with its audience of more than 1 billion people. Now it looks like things might taper off. Before the boycott began, YouTube's ad revenue after subtracting commissions was expected to rise 26 percent this year to $7 billion, based on estimates from the research firm eMarketer. Alphabet doesn't disclose YouTube's finances. Advertisers began to flee YouTube last month, after The Times in London and other media outlets turned up evidence that their brands were appearing alongside clips promoting terrorism and racism. The findings alerted advertisers that YouTube didn't have adequate technology or staffing to shield brands from some of the appalling material that gets posted on a site that receives 400 hours of video per minute. 'This is an ostrich situation where the ostrich just pulled its head out of the sand,' says Harry Kargman, CEO of Kargo, which helps manage ad campaigns on mobile devices. At one point, about 250 advertisers were boycotting YouTube. (Some also stepped back from a related system that Google operates to place commercials next to videos on outside websites.)  The list included big-spending marketers such as PepsiCo, Wal-Mart Stores, Starbucks, AT&T, Verizon, Johnson & Johnson, and Volkswagen. It's unclear how many, if any, of those have returned to YouTube since Google promised to hire more human reviewers and upgrade its technology to keep ads away from repugnant videos. Both Verizon and AT&T, two companies that are trying to expand their own digital ad networks to compete with Google, told The Associated Press that they are still boycotting YouTube.  FX Networks confirmed that it isn't advertising on YouTube either. Several other boycotting marketers contacted by AP didn't respond. This Wednesday, April 26, 2017, photo shows the Google mobile phone icon, in Philadelphia. Alphabet Inc., parent company of Google, reports financial results, Thursday, April 27, 2017. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke) Even if advertisers return, Kargman predicted they are unlikely to spend as much as they once did. 'It's going to be a slow burn as brands quietly shift their spending away,' he said. 'There are now questions about the quality of video on YouTube in the long term.' Investors, however, apparently aren't too worried so far. YouTube's financial contributions remain a fairly small part of a company expected to generate $87 billion in revenue this year, after subtracting ad commissions. RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney estimates the reduced spending on YouTube and Google's ad network for video on third-party sites could reduce Alphabet's net revenue by $300 million, to $1.5 billion, this year. Some of that spending could shift to Facebook, Mahaney said, although the social network is facing its own challenges trying to block live videos of violence that appall viewers and advertisers alike.

The major lenders are expected to unveil more that $15b in profits in the coming days More evidence house price growth in Sydney and Melbourne slowed over April Footwear retailer RCG Corp plunges on an earnings downgrade Investors are similarly unimpressed with a sales downgrade from Mayne Pharma Sort posts by Newest Oldest 4:43pm That's it for Markets Live today. Thanks for reading and your comments.        See you all again tomorrow morning from 9. 4:43pm If the Reserve Bank was still retaining its narrow focus on keeping inflation between 2 and 3 per cent per annum, it would be cutting interest rates at its May meeting on Tuesday. Futures traders and economists are almost certain it won't, and will, instead, keep rates steady for the ninth straight month when it meets tomorrow. Market economists are glad for the RBA's ability to look beyond inflation rates when setting the interest rate – though opinions differ on what exactly it should be focusing on. The domestic economic is growing, but still weak. And the currency is still high – factors that some say should lead the RBA to cut rates. But record-low interest rates, others argue, have added oomph to booming housing markets in Sydney and Melbourne, leading them to conclude raising interest rates would be the most effective way to address this. "I think they should be cutting," said Market Economics' Stephen Koukoulas, an economic adviser to former prime minister Julia Gillard. "We had confirmation last week that underlying inflation has been stuck below the bottom of the target band for what, 18 months, and shows few signs of picking up. "We've got no prospect of underlying inflation moving into the target. "Add to that unemployment edging up, underemployment high, retail sales weak ... to me those criteria would suggest that we need lower rates." If the RBA were solely concerned with inflation-targeting, it would be cutting to 1 per cent, said Capital Economics' chief Australia/New Zealand economist Paul Dales. The Australian economy, he said, would benefit from a lower currency.  "One thing [RBA] governor [Philip] Lowe has communicated effectively is his growing concerns about financial stability. That's why economists are thinking on these lines – governor Lowe himself said he's concerned about dealing with a mess in five years' time when the housing market pops. "I think interest rates should be around where they are – and should stay there for a long time. It's not an ideal situation ... but now is not the right time to keep going [at inflation]."

OK, that's a long lede, but stay with us. The ASX 200 added 32 points or 0.5 per cent to 5956, preparing for another assault on the 6000-mark - a threshold it tried and failed to overcome on four different occasions some 2 years ago. Its looking increasingly likely the banks will push us over the brink thanks to what are expected to be strong earnings numbers in the coming days. They moved in and out of favour this morning before ultimately pushing higher: Westpac added 0.7 per cent, ANZ 0.6 per cent, NAB 0.3 per cent and CBA 0.1 per cent. Macquarie added 1.2 per cent. Only one in four of the top 200 names were lower, reflecting the day's gains was more than a financial sector story. Telstra's 0.9 per cent gain was a help, as was a 1.4 per cent jump in Wesfarmers and a more modest 0.6 per cent gain. BHP added 0.7 per cent, but Rio and Fortescue lost 1 per cent. South32 fell 2.2 per cent. Mayne Pharma was the worst performer in the top 200 after announcing lower than expected sales from its generic drugs portfolio. Outside the bigger names, footwear retailer RCG Corp plunged 27 per cent on an earnings downgrade. Winners and losers today in the top 200. Photo: Bloomberg 4:18pm In our latest instalment of "healthcare stocks behaving badly" (allegedly): Australia's largest private hospital operator Ramsay Health Care is being accused of threatening to reduce surgeons' access to operating theatres in Coffs Harbour if they became involved with a competitor. Competition regulator ACCC brought a Federal Court claim against Ramsay on Monday, alleging misuse of market power and exclusive dealing. ACCC alleges when Ramsay became aware that a group of Coffs Harbour surgeons were planning to establish a competing private day surgery facility in Coffs Harbour, senior Ramsay executives told these surgeons if they became involved with the competitor Ramsay would substantially reduce or withdraw their access to operating theatre time at Baringa Hospital. It is alleged the surgeons suspended their plans to establish a competing day surgery as a result of Ramsay executives' threats. Ramsay operates Baringa Private Hospital and the Coffs Harbour Day Surgery, the only private hospital and private day surgery facilities in the Coffs Harbour region. "New independent day surgeries in other areas have increased competition, reduced waiting lists and costs, delivered greater choice, and improved access to surgical procedures. It is vital to ensure such competition is not stamped out by established operators," ACCC chairman Rod Sims said. "Misuse of market power and other anti-competitive practices can cause significant harm to consumers, other businesses, and the competitive process more generally, which is why we believe this is an important case for us to take," he said. ACCC is seeking pecuniary penalties, declarations, compliance program orders and legal costs against Ramsay. Ramsay said in an ASX statement it intends to vigorously defend the matter. "As the matter is now before the court, Ramsay will not be making any further comment ont he allegations other than as required to keep the market informed in accordance with its continuous disclosure obligations." Ramsay shares fell 1.4 per cent today to $70.70. 3:37pm Mayne Pharma buried its bad news a long way back in its presentation to investors today but when shareholders caught on their reaction was sharp. The company's shares plunged more than 10 per cent after it revealed sales for a flagship suite of US generic drugs would not meet guidance. The news was buried on on page 107 of a 110-page oupdate released to coincide with an investor day the company was holding today. The company said in the investor update that tougher generic drug pricing was behind the revised guidance for the suite of drugs called the Teva portfolio. Mayne bought the portfolio of drugs from pharmaceutical giant Teva Pharmaceuticals last year for $845 million. The aquisition saw Mayne's first-half profit soar 278 per cent to $72.7 million in February. Mayne, which is worth more than $1.8 billion, re-affirmed its full-year profit guidance only a few weeks ago during its first half results in February. Chief executive Scott Richards said at the time that the outlook for the group "continues to be positive with significant growth opportunities from recent acquisitions, new product launches, further business development activities and transaction-related revenue and cost synergies." He said the generic product division would benefit in the second half from a full six-months' contribution from the Teva product acquisition. Mayne shares also dived in December on the back of a US price fixing lawsuit. The civil complaint filed by 20 US states accuses six companies – including Teva and Mayne – of conspiring to artificially inflate prices on an antibiotic and a diabetes drug.

The company's bad news was buried at the end of a 110-page update. Photo: Josh Robenstone Back to top 3:10pm US House and Senate negotiators reached a tentative bipartisan deal on Sunday night (Monday AEDT) on a $US1.1 trillion bill to keep the government open until the end of September, according to Republican and Democratic aides. GOP leaders eager to focus on health care and tax overhauls bowed to Democratic demands to eliminate hundreds of policy restrictions aimed at curbing regulations from the bill, leaving the Trump administration with few victories. The White House sought funding to begin building the border wall, a well as $18 billion in cuts to domestic agencies, and both demands were rebuffed. The spending deal includes money for Planned Parenthood, despite Republican demands to defund the group over its provision of abortions. The deal's provisions were described by aides on condition of anonymity ahead of a formal announcement. President Donald Trump will be able to point to a $15 billion boost for the Pentagon, although $2.5 billion of that money is contingent on the administration delivering a new plan to fight Islamic State. Trump also will get a $1.5 billion for border security, but it can't be used for the border wall or additional Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, according to a congressional aide. There are also no new restrictions on money going to so-called sanctuary cities that don't fully enforce federal immigration laws. "This agreement is a good agreement for the American people, and takes the threat of a government shutdown off the table," Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said on Sunday night in a statement. "The bill ensures taxpayer dollars aren't used to fund an ineffective border wall, excludes poison pill riders, and increases investments in programs that the middle-class relies on, like medical research, education, and infrastructure." Donald Trump will be able to point to a $15 billion boost for the Pentagon. Photo: AP 2:33pm The backer of a Chinese joint-venture in advanced talks with Quintis to become its new preferred buyer in China is a former director of the Australian sandalwood grower. Graeme Scott has held board seats on Quintis' finance arm Arwon Finance, Quintis Forestry, Quintis Leasing and the parent Quintis, which was known as TFS at the time. Those directorships concluded in 2005 and 2006 and he remains a shareholder of the Perth-based group. Mr Scott is one of the parties behind a joint venture in China that is in negotiations with Quintis to become potentially its biggest buyer in China, following a disclosure in March that Quintis' largest buyer had yet to place an order this year amid a crackdown on duty avoidance by mainland importers. In an update on Monday, Quintis told shareholders that it struck an agreement with a mystery plantation investor at the eleventh hour to extend the life of a put option worth more than $30 million. The put, which if exercised forces Quintis to buy back immature sandalwood trees off the investor at a fixed price of previously $33.9 million, was due to expire on April 30. It is the second time it has been rolled over. Under the new terms, and "in light of the current corporate activity", it can be exercised between either July 10 to 14, or December 11 to 15 this year. If the investor exercises their option in the July window, the value of the contract is unchanged. If the investor elects to exercise in December, the value of the put increases by 6.25 per cent, a sweetener of 15 per cent on the equivalent annual rate. Quintis became a target of intense short selling when a contested research report published by US hedge fund Glaucus argued that Quintis shares were worth zero and likened the business to a Ponzi scheme, claims that the company consistently disputes. The subsequent fall in its share price was followed by the exit of its founder and chief executive Frank Wilson, who declared a plan to partner with a backer and take back the company. 1:57pm In an up-and-down day the ASX is once again pushing higher, with fluctuating interest in the major lenders accounting for much of the action. The ASX 200 is up 17 points, or by 0.3 per cent, to 5941. As mentioned, the big four banks are the swing factor. After starting all higher, they copped some selling later in the morning but are now mixed.  Westpac and ANZ are up a touch, NAB is flat, while CBA is off 0.3 per cent. Rio and Fortescue are down, but BHP has climbed. South32 is down 2 per cent, Wesfarmers is recovering from its trading update last week, up 1.7 per cent, while Woolies is 0.3 per cent ahead. One of the worst performers is Mayne Pharma, down 10 per cent as it lowered it sales guidance in its Teva generic drugs business. 1:50pm The flood of Israeli-based start-ups listing on the ASX is showing no signs of abating, with secure communications technology company Elsight the latest planning to go public on the exchange. The company is raising $6.5 million at 20¢ a share and a valuation of $18.17 million. It has met with a range of institutional investors and family offices on a roadshow in Australia this month. It joins the likes of Israeli firms Votiro Cybersec and CyberGym which are also listing on the ASX this year. Chief executive and co-founder Nir Gabay said the stock market in Israel was "weak", so firms had started looking for other options. "The next option was the NASDAQ, but you need to be a $1 billion company to list there, then you look at Hong Kong, but even then you need to be a $150 million company," he said. "But there is a good relationship between the ASX and Israel, so that was the best option for us." As part of the listing, Elsight has created a new Elsight Limited Australia company which will acquire the assets of Elsight Israel. The Israeli company is already profitable, having made a net profit of $US98,000 ($131,000) for the full year to December 31 and $US932,000 in revenue. Elsight's technology is designed for in-the-field communications and allows video and other data streams to be sent securely over multiple networks simultaneously, increasing bandwidth and allowing video to be streamed from the other side of the world in almost real time. It works by splitting the data into packages, encrypting these and then transmitting them via multiple sim cards, WiFi, LAN or radio networks and then reassembling it at the other end. The company was founded in 2009 by Mr Gabay and Roee Kashi, with the men having come from the Israeli special forces and military intelligence. Until recently Elsight had been prevented from selling internationally by the Israeli government. Elsight currently has customers in Israel, South Africa, Singapore, Vietnam and Malaysia. The capital raised through the listing will go towards research and development, as well as marketing, as it expands into other industries such as logistics, transport and media. Elsight co-founders Roee Kashi and Nir Gabay are taking the company public on the ASX. Photo: Paul Jeffers 1:17pm "It always feels odd talking in 't's and 'trillions' not 'b's and 'billions'," Duncan Burns says. "But we never lose sight of the fact that its our clients' money and they have entrusted us to manage it."   The former Wall Street investment banker and hedge fund trader probably oversees more money than just about any portfolio manager in Australia, but he's an unlikely subject for a profile. If Burns has any views on the market, compelling stock tips or diatribes about the stupidity of central bankers and politicians, he's not willing to share them. Instead, Vanguard's head trader wants to talk about how he and his team invest and trade hundreds of billions of dollars trying to track the region's stock market indices at the lowest cost. Last year he said, his team traded $100 billion of stocks in the region. "If we can save one basis point through more efficient trading on that $100 billion, that's $10 million saved in investors' accounts, right where it belongs." The one dominant trend in funds management is how every day, billions of dollars are given up on trying to beat the market, and moving from active funds to lower-cost passive funds. Vanguard, by virtue of its ultra low costs, has captured much of this flow and has swelled its assets under management to $5.4 trillion, of which $2.9 trillion are tracking equity indices around the world. The portfolio managers and traders based in Melbourne are responsible for $93 billion of funds across the Asia-Pacific region. As Burns explains, they're some of the toughest and highest cost equity markets in the world and when the objective is to track the stock market at the lowest possible cost. It's a daily challenge. "Indexing is really simple to understand and implement. However, it requires a lot of behind-the-scenes work to execute well. "The benchmark indices are calculated without the frictional cost of transacting in the real world – so right out of the gate we are behind as an indexing community." Read more at the AFR. Vanguard portfolio manager Duncan Burns doesn't give stock tips. Photo: Pat Scala Back to top 12:44pm Footwear retailer RCG Corp has slashed full-year profit guidance by 11 per cent – the second downgrade in three months – after sales of brands such as Skechers, Vans and Doc Martens remained weak in March and April. RCG, which owns Hype DC, The Accent Group and The Athletes Foot, now expects underlying EBITDA for the year ending June to come in between $74 million and $80 million, compared with $60 million in 2016. RCG shares have plunged 19 per cent to 67¢ in early trade on Monday, taking losses since February to 50 per cent. RCG cut its guidance in February from $90 million to between $85 million and $88 million after like-for-like sales at Hype went backwards in the eight weeks after Christmas and sales growth slowed in the Accent division.  RCG's co-chief executive Hilton Brett said trading conditions had been challenging in the last two months, confirming anecdotal reports that discretionary spending had remained lacklustre since consumers snapped their handbags closed after Christmas. Mr Brett said like-for-like sales in the Accent Retail and Hype business in March and April were flat. Whilst this was an improvement on trading between Boxing Day and mid-February, when Hype like-for-like sales fell 2.8 per cent, sales had not met management's expectations. The Athlete's Foot failed to grow sales, despite gains at rival chains such as Super Retail Group's Rebel Sport, while same-store sales at RCG's vertical retail business had fallen 5 per cent since mid-February and wholesale sales were below expectations. The latest downgrade is likely to fuel fears that the athleisure trend has peaked after five years of strong growth. "The slowing sales that RCG is experiencing are in line with our view that the growth rates experienced by athleisure footwear will moderate as the cycle matures," Citigroup's small cap consumer analyst Sam Teeger said in a recent report. The struggles at RCG Group may have to do with the waning of the athleisure trend more broadly. Photo: BrettHemmings.com 12:37pm Chinese gas distributor ENN and private equity firm Hony Capital now jointly hold a 12.81 per cent of embattled oil and gas group Santos after ENN revealedtoday that it was "acting in concert" with Hony. The move comes just days before the Santos annual general meeting scheduled to be held on Thursday. ENN, which is itself controlled by Chinese billionaire Wang Yusuo, became a big shareholder in Santos in March 2016 when it bought an 11.7 per cent stake, which had previously been held by Hony Capital. Hony bought up extra shares of its own accord in late 2016 and there has been much speculation in the market that the two had been working in unison. That has now been formalised by the Chinese duo, with the signing of an "Acting in Concert" agreement, which stretches for the next 24 months. There has been speculation from time to time about whether the Chinese firms may eventually seek more control of Santos. Hony originally became a shareholder in late 2015 when it took up a large chunk of shares in Santos as part of a share placement and equity raising. That capital raising and placement followed the rejection by the Santos board of a separate $7 billion takeover bid by an entity called Scepter Partners which was backed by the royal families of Brunei and the United Arab Emirates. ENN in late 2016 sent a letter to Santos chairman Peter Coates expressing annoyance at being denied a seat on the board after it pushed for a directorships because of its large holding. A substantial shareholder notice lodged with the ASX on Monday showed that ENN's stake in Santos was now 12.81 per cent, up from 11.82 per cent in the previous notice given by ENN to the ASX on May 2, 2016. Santos has been under the pump in the past week because Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull is putting in place by July 1 a mechanism which will allow for the imposition of export controls to be placed on selected gas companies when there there is a shortfall of gas supply in the domestic market. Santos shares are 0.7 per cent lower at $3.46, and have plunged by more than a quarter of the past 12 months. Chinese gas distributor ENN now holds 12.81 per cent of Santos. Photo: Supplied 11:51am Prices in Sydney and Melbourne slowed in April mainly due to falls in apartment prices, but more data is needed before a cooling is confirmed, CoreLogic said in its April Hedonic Home Value Index. There was no increase in Sydney's overall house price in April while Melbourne's house price rose a small 0.5 per cent. Canberra posted the largest fall in prices among the capital cities of 2.8 per cent.  "The two hottest housing markets in the nation have shown signs of slowing down in April, with the CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index recording a rise of just 0.1 per cent over April, the lowest month-on-month rise in capital city dwelling values since December 2015," head of research Tim Lawless said. "The moderation in growth was due largely to a slightly negative April result in Australia's largest capital city housing market, Sydney, where dwelling values were broadly flat over the month." "The market is slowing down but we need to see a few more months before we make a a conclusion that the market has peaked. It's [still] coming down from such a high base." "We need to be cautious in calling a peak in the market after only one month of soft results. April, in particular, coincides with seasonal factors including Easter, school holidays and ANZAC day long weekend." Mr Lawless classified the fall in prices in Canberra and even a rise in prices in Darwin as "noise". But the impact of APRA's tightening on investor loans should not be disregarded although property agents said the impact of cooling measures would take time and over several months. "The softer results should also be viewed against a backdrop of an ever evolving regulatory landscape s which is firmly aimed at slowing investment and interest-only mortgage lending," Mr Lawless added. "Testament to this is mortgage rates which have been edging higher, particularly for investors and interest-only loans, as well as rental yields which have been hovering around record lows. The higher cost of debt, as well as stricter lending and servicing criteria, has likely dented investment demand over recent months." Sydney house prices have risen more than 70 per cent since 2012, but there has been a slowdown in April.  Photo: Wolter Peeters 11:30am Photo: The Wall Street Journal A year ago, many investors had given up on Apple, whose stock price had fallen more than 30 per cent from its 2015 peak. Apple's once-unstoppable growth had come to a crashing halt: the number of iPhones sold was down 13 per cent, and the company posted its first revenue decline in 13 years. Today, Apple's business remains sluggish, but that hasn't stopped investors, including the famously tech-averse Warren Buffett, from falling in love with it again. Shares of the tech giant - the most valuable company in the United States by market value - have repeatedly hit new highs this year. On Friday, they closed at $US143.65, up nearly 60 per cent from last May's trough. What's driving the stock, say sceptics and fans alike, is hope - hope that the new iPhones due in September, after the 10th anniversary of the original iPhone's introduction, will be dazzling enough to inspire existing iPhone users to upgrade and prompt others to switch from Android phones made by Samsung, Huawei and other manufacturers. "Everyone expects Apple to cure cancer with their next product launch," said Kevin Landis, chief executive of Firsthand Funds, who has managed tech-focused mutual funds through many ups and downs. Investors will get more data about Apple's performance, and perhaps some clues about its future, on Tuesday (US time), when the company reports its results for the financial quarter that ended in March. Analysts expect the company to report a slight increase in iPhone sales and overall revenue. Meanwhile, The Wall Street Journal says Apple is expected to report that its stockpile of cash has topped a quarter of a trillion [US] dollars, an unrivaled corporate hoard that is greater than the market value of both Wal-Mart and Procter & Gamble and exceeds the combined foreign-currency reserves held by the UK and Canada combined. Apple is expected to make more updates in its next high-end iPhone, including a high-resolution screen that covers the phone's entire face. But the company has also suggested that much of its future growth will come from services like Apple Music, Apple Pay and the cut that Apple takes from application sales and subscriptions in the app store.

Despite uncertainly around foreign investment rules, Chinese companies pumped $15.4 billion into Australian deals last year with commercial property, infrastructure and agriculture the most popular. Now in its sixth year the report, Demystifying Chinese Investment in Australia, found that mining, once the backbone of the investment relationship, had dropped to sixth place with deals worth $839 million last year, down 35 per cent from 2015.  Co-author of the report, Doug Ferguson from KPMG, said Australia's investment relationship with China continued to diversity with a record number of deals in 2016, while more of these than ever before were done by private companies. Just under half the value of Chinese investment in Australia last year was conducted by private companies, although many of these would have received financing from state-owned banks and retained strong links to Beijing. "Despite the impact of uncertainties about Australia's foreign investment review regime, Chinese investment ... continued to diversity and records were smashed," said Mr Ferguson. He said Chinese investment in Australia was starting to "mature" and that parties from the mainland accepted they often needed to form local joint ventures and take minority stakes for high profile deals. This attitude saw property develop Shanghai CRED team-up with Gina Reinehart and accept a minority stake in the purchase of the Kidman cattle empire. But while Australia retains its second place behind the United States in the aggregate value of Chinese investment since 2007, another of the report's co-authors warns that others were catching up. While forecasting strong outbound investment over the longer term, the reported noted efforts by Beijing to moderate capital outflows to keep the yuan relatively strong may impact deals this year. "Real estate, hotels, films, entertainment and sports clubs are among the industries singled out as exhibiting a tendency for 'irrational' overseas investments," the report said. "This is expected to impact investment flows to these sectors in the future." Chinese investment in Australia is at its highest point since the 2008 global financial crisis, according to a new report. Photo: Rolex Dela Pena Back to top 10:33am Shares have shaken off a soft overseas lead to open firmly higher in early trade as investors bet on solid bank results amid a broad uplift. The ASX 200 is up 21 points or 0.3 per cent at 5945 points. Investors are still happy to push banks higher ahead of earnings numbers, Westpac up 0.4 per cent, while ANZ and CBA have added 0.3 per cent. NAB is only marginally higher, while Macquarie continues to push towards its pre-GFC highs, adding another 1.3 per cent. Gains in Woolies, Wesfarmers, Tesltra and CSL are all bolstering the index as it climbs towards 6000 points. Mining and energy stocks are the drags, with BHP off 0.2 per cent, Rio down 0.3 per cent and Rio 1.2 per cent despite Friday night's strong increase in spot iron ore prices. Yesterday's weaker than expected Chinese factory activity indicator may have had something to do with the weakness for the sector. South32 is down 0.5 per cent. In energy, Origin's 1 per cent drop, Santos's 0.7 per cent loss and Oil Search's 0.6 per cent is weighing against the morning's gains. Among the morning's biggest movers is Platinum Asset Mgt, which has dropped 4.4 per cent, while gold miners feature strongly in the best performers. Winners and losers in the ASX 200 this morning. Photo: Bloomberg 10:07am The combined profits of Australia's big four banks likely exceeded $15 billion in the first half, as lenders started to benefit from a round of late 2016 interest rate hikes and strong home loan growth. Big four investors have enjoyed share price gains of more than 6 per cent so far this year, and half-year results from three of the big four in the coming weeks are expected to show profits also ground higher across the industry. Even so, there remains a question mark about whether NAB and Westpac can sustain their dividends, as the industry prepares for looming rules that may force lenders to set aside billions more in capital. ANZ will kick off the half-year bank reporting season tomorrow, with analysts tipping a $3.5 billion cash profit in the six months to March, and a flat interim dividend of 80¢ a share. NAB on Thursday is tipped to deliver earnings of $3.25 billion and also keep its dividend flat. Macquarie Group, whose share price last week closed at $93, not far off its 2007 record high of $97.10, is tipped to deliver a full-year profit of more than $2.1 billion on Friday. That would exceed last year's record of $2.06 billion for the investment bank, which will be among the biggest local winners from promised company tax cuts in the United States. Next week, Westpac's profits are expected to exceed $4 billion and CBA, which reports on June financial year, will post a quarterly update, after it notched up half-year profits of $4.84 billion in February. Profits have likely grown across the industry on the back of housing credit growth of 6.5 per cent in the last six months, analysts believe, propelled by higher house prices in Melbourne and Sydney. There are few signs of distress in banks' loan books, and a round of interest rate hikes targeted at property investors in late 2016 may have also helped earnings. "We expect near-term earnings to be well supported by mortgage repricing benefits, investor-led credit growth, benign credit environment and solid trading income," said Macquarie analyst Victor German.

The market expects solid profit growth when half-year results from ANZ, NAB and Westpac are delivered in May. Photo: Paul Rovere 9:56am on 1 May 2017 Late last week the S&P 500 volatility index, or VIX, hit its lowest level since 2014, and its second lowest level this decade. "The Vix has plummeted below 11, just as we see the big drivers of the rally beginning to lose steam. Indeed, our derivatives strategy team recently noted that several asset classes were pricing a 'world almost free of risk'," a Bank of America Merrill Lynch strategist said in a note late last week. One of your Eds wrote on the topic over the weekend: After years of falling interest rates and central bank support investors have become comfortable buying high and selling higher. Perhaps it's a new bubble: in complacency. What will pop it is anyone's guess. Investors are quick to shrug off worries – France is so last week – and are prepared to buy high in order to sell higher. This is classic bullish behaviour. No surprise there; we are, after all, in a global bull market. Apparently there is no obvious reason for investors to make any dramatic portfolio decisions. Sure, equities are pricey, as are most assets after years of falling rates and central bank bond-buying. But the European Union is not about to break up now that we've decided Le Pen has no chance of winning the second round of French voting. And the global growth upswing is still looking solid. Meanwhile Reuters numbers tell us that listed US companies are having their best quarter of profits since 2011. A global fund manager recently told me that his biggest worry, at least over the short term, was the potential for a big policy mistake in China. The Chinese government has plenty of levers it can pull to maintain growth and stability. The real concern, this fundie said, is that it will pull the wrong ones, or perhaps the right one at the wrong time. That said, a slump on the Shanghai bourse in recent weeks has barely registered globally, despite the falls being driven by a regulatory crackdown on leverage in the Chinese sharemarket. Granted the losses in mainland Chinese shares are not too dramatic, but they have been out of step with the rest of the emerging world, as well as the pro-risk mood more broadly. It suggests investors are not as worried as they were in late 2015 and into 2016 when ham-handed policy interventions sparked a massive wave of anxiety across global markets. Read more at The Financial Review. Investors are apparently not worried about anything much, according to the VIX.  9:44am on 1 May 2017 SPONSORED POST There's something for everyone in markets this week, writes IG strategist Chris Weston: The ASX 200 financial sub-sector needs to hold and build on its break of 7000 and from here make an assault on the 2015 highs which is a mere 2.8% away. Interestingly, the all-time high for the sub-index (from 2007) sits 7.8% away, which seems far more attainable than the broader ASX 200, which needs to appreciate 15.6% to print a new all-time high. The idea of "sell in May and go away" is certainly being talked about, but let's not forget last May the ASX 200 gained 2.4% and despite the average loss over the past decade being 1.6%, most of that can be explained by poor monthly performances in the years between 2010 and 2013. June is actually a far worse month historically to be holding ASX 200 exposure, falling 2.2% on average. We have central bank meetings from the RBA, the Federal Reserve and for FX traders one can also look at the Norges Bank. We have the Fed funds futures pricing at 64% chance of a June hike (from the Federal Reserve), but that pricing mechanism could also easily change given we have pretty much key piece of US economic data being released. Here we see ISM manufacturing (tonight at midnight), core PCE, vehicle sales, services ISM and non-farm payrolls on Friday (consensus 190,000 jobs). We also have the small affair of the French presidential elections on Sunday, and while many see this as a fait accompli, some are showing concern that Nicolas Dupont-Aignan, a first round candidate, has formally endorsed Marine Le Pen and this may provide her with a few extra votes. The market doesn't seem too concerned by this though and still see a fairly comfortable victory for Macron, with implied volatility still subdued and EUR/USD nicely supported into $1.0850. Read more. Play Video Replay Video Will bank earnings drive the ASX 200 towards 6000? With ANZ, NAB, MQG and WBC all reporting earnings in the days ahead, will the numbers and outlook breathe further life into a sector that is clearly outperforming. (This video was produced in commercial partnership between Fairfax Media and IG Markets). 9:37am on 1 May 2017 Photo: CBA Growth in China's manufacturing sector slowed faster than expected in April, an official survey showed on Sunday, as producer price rises lost steam and authorities moved to tackle risks in the property market and credit growth. The official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 51.2 in April from the previous month's 51.8, which was the strongest reading since April 2012. Analysts polled by Reuters had predicted a reading of 51.6, the ninth straight month above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis. Growth in China's services sector slowed slightly to 54.0 in April, compared with the previous month's reading of 55.1, which was the highest since May 2014. Despite the lower PMI figure, the "drivers of industrial recovery remain intact", CBA China and Asia economist Wei Li said. "We expect industrial production growth to register 6.9 per cent year-on-year in April, compared with an average growth rate of 6.8 per cent in Q1," Li wrote. China's economy grew a faster-than-expected 6.9 percent in the first quarter, boosted by higher government infrastructure spending and a gravity-defying property boom. Chinese leaders have pledged to shift the emphasis to addressing financial risks and asset bubbles, which analysts say pose a threat to the world's second-largest economy if not handed well. President Xi Jinping last week called for increased efforts to ward off systemic risks to help maintain financial security, the official Xinhua news agency reported. Some analysts believe China's economic growth may have peaked in the first quarter but that it's on track to hit a target of around 6.5 per cent this year. CBA's Li is more bullish, forecasting the country's GDP to expand by 6.8 per cent in 2017 - the same pace as last year. China's producer price inflation cooled for the first time in seven months in March as iron ore and coal prices tumbled, while property sales growth slowed in the first quarter despite robust property investment.

By TrippMickle Apple Inc. is expected to report Tuesday that its stockpile of cash has topped a quarter of a trillion dollars, an unrivaled corporate hoard that is greater than the market value of both Wal-Mart Stores Inc. WMT, -0.34%   and Procter & Gamble Co. PG, -0.41%   and exceeds the combined foreign-currency reserves held by the U.K. and Canada combined. The money, more than 90% which is stockpiled outside of the U.S., has drawn fresh attention as President Donald Trump has proposed slashing business taxes and a one-time tax holiday on corporate cash brought home. That could ratchet up pressure on the tech giant to make splashy acquisitions or dole out more money to shareholders.

In the last three months of 2016, it racked up new cash at a rate of about $3.6 million an hour. As of December, the company had $246.09 billion total cash, cash equivalents, and securities. Apple, like many big American companies, parks most of that cash offshore rather than paying U.S. taxes on its overseas profits. An expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com.

By TrippMickle Apple Inc. is expected to report Tuesday that its stockpile of cash has topped a quarter of a trillion dollars, an unrivaled corporate hoard that is greater than the market value of both Wal-Mart Stores Inc. WMT, -0.34%   and Procter & Gamble Co. PG, -0.41%   and exceeds the combined foreign-currency reserves held by the U.K. and Canada combined. The money, more than 90% which is stockpiled outside of the U.S., has drawn fresh attention as President Donald Trump has proposed slashing business taxes and a one-time tax holiday on corporate cash brought home. That could ratchet up pressure on the tech giant to make splashy acquisitions or dole out more money to shareholders.

In the last three months of 2016, it racked up new cash at a rate of about $3.6 million an hour. As of December, the company had $246.09 billion total cash, cash equivalents, and securities.

News Sports Entertainment Life Opinion Obituaries ePaper Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds log in Site Site Archive Brooklyn residents clean up town for Earth Day Sunday Apr 30, 2017 at 4:53 PM Apr 30, 2017 at 9:29 PM Francesca Kefalas For The Bulletin BROOKLYN — Residents young and old were out in force spiffing up their town this weekend during Brooklyn’s annual Earth Day cleanup. The town waited an extra week to ensure it could get even more people involved, and it seems to have worked. “We already have more people out picking up trash than we did last year,” said Melissa Bradley, executive assistant to the first selectmen and Board of Selectmen at 9:30 a.m. Saturday, a half hour after the cleanup officially started. Bradley organized the event for the town and, for the second year, got a $500 grant from The Last Green Valley to cover cleanup supplies. Bradley also secured donations from Pepsi, Wal-Mart and Frito Lay to provide snacks for the volunteers helping the cleanup. Cub Scout Pack 44 worked to clean up the grounds of Old Trinity Church on Church Street Saturday. Trinity Church is the pack’s sponsor, said Cub Master Keith Price, so the effort helped both the church and the town. “We wanted to make sure we did this on the day the town was holding its cleanup,” Price said. Cub Scout Anthony Genna, 7, said he thought the cleanup was a fun way to spend the day. “It feels good to help,” Anthony said. Fellow Cub Scout Jacob Whiteley, 8, spent most of his day raking up leaves. “Raking the leaves is my favorite job,” Jacob said. Members of the pack were not the only ones out around town for the cleanup. Conservation Commission member Jeannine Noel picked up five bags of trash on Day Street before 9:45 a.m., when she joined the rest of the commission at Riverside Park for a cleanup and to plant native shrubs and bushes. Noel said she was happy to participate in the cleanup. “It’s a positive thing for the town,” Noel said. “The idea is if people see us cleaning maybe they’ll be less likely to litter.” Diane Wimmer, chairman of the Conservation Commission, said the plantings are meant to return the passive recreation portion of Riverside Park back to a natural meadow in order to let local wildlife to thrive. In addition to the cleanup, the town also offered free bulky waste drop-off at the transfer station. A steady stream of residents might mean the town would get even more bulky waste than it expected. “There was a line at 7:30 a.m., and we weren’t supposed to open until 8 a.m.,” First Selectman Rick Ives said. “The phone here never rings and it hasn’t stopped ringing. I think people have been looking forward to this day. We had one guy come in here with eight or nine tires that he had just picked up on the sides of roads.”     About Us Sign up for daily e-mail Subscribe Site Services Contact Us Advertise With Us Customer Service Place an ad Purchase a photo Archives Advertising/Classified Cars Homes Today's Ads Classifieds Obituaries Find Norwich jobs Community Info CtSunlight.org Connecticut tourism The Last Green Valley Sex Offender Registry Gas Buddy DOT traffic cameras Comcast Public Access Television Local Business Northeast Chamber of Commerce Greater Norwich Area Chamber of Commerce Chamber of Commerce of Eastern Connecticut Chamber of Commerce Inc.

Greg Abbott said Sunday. The governor spoke during a press conference in Canton about emergency officials top priorities, including rescue and recovery. Abbott displayed a map showing the path of the tornadoes. Blue dots were marked on the map, indicating addresses where the storm hit. "I've seen the tragedy of what these tornadoes can do. ... We as Texans ... we've come together to respond to challenges like this to help our neighbors. Now is the time to come together," the governor said. Abbott encouraged people wanting to help to donate strategically, saying a monetary donation might be best. The county judge is expected to provide a location later today to send financial aid. The EMS Station in Canton at 600 Industrial is a location where goods may be dropped off. The affected area is under a curfew from dusk to dawn, according to the Van Zandt County judge, but the Canton mayor said that the city of Canton proper will not be under a curfew.  The mayor of Canton said that four people have been confirmed dead and that two people were still unaccounted for. Forty-nine people were taken to area hospitals and a triage remains open at Canton High School band hall. There will be a curfew for affected areas in the county. It will not include the city of Canton, officials said. WATCH LIVE: Press conference for Sunday afternoon tornado damage update At least four people were killed and ETMC says they have treated more than 50 people after Saturday tornadoes in Van Zandt County.  At a Canton Dodge dealership, a woman was found deceased. She is believed to have been in a vehicle on I-20. Off of Hwy 64 east of Canton, a man was found deceased in a pasture.  A Corsicana man died in a detached garage outside a mansion after the race car he was working on fell on him when the tornado hit. He was pronounced dead by a justice of the peace at 11 p.m. The JP said that this home was the scene of a wedding that had been planned for later in the evening, which, of course, did not occur. A man died after he was blown from his home on VZ CR 2434. His wife, who was sitting in a chair beside him at the time, was treated and released from a hospital with stitches and bruises.  During a press conference at 9:30 a.m. on Sunday, Canton Mayor Lou Ann Everett said that at least four fatalities have been confirmed. 49 injured people were taken to area hospitals, 16 of which were triaged at Canton High school, she said. County Judge Don Kirkpatrick said that search and rescue teams with K9s are going door to door in the area. He said that since first responders are still in the recovery stage, so volunteers are not being allowed in the area Sunday, though they are grateful for the willing people. Volunteers are going to be needed soon, however, he added. 7OnScene: Tracking storm damage across East Texas National Weather Service: 4 confirmed tornadoes hit East Texas, survey could take days Search and recovery was hindered on Saturday night by downed trees and power lines. More intensive efforts got underway at daybreak on Sunday. Mayor Everett said that the storm report she has received said the damage area is 35 miles wide, and 15 miles wide. She said that she signed a disaster declaration for Canton, and that she has been contacted by the state representative, state senator and other elected officials.  Everett said that Oncor is onsite, and staging at Walmart. There are at least 30 crews in the area. The hope is that power will be restored by midnight, but they will know more as the day progresses. Five major transformer poles were downed, she said, and some of those are difficult to access, so repairs could take time.  Cancellations Eustace and Fruitvale independent school districts have canceled classes Monday. Eustace says classes will resume Tuesday. The high school library pit will be open for people to charge their devices. Karen Wilson, district clerk for Van Zandt County said jury duty has been canceled Monday for the 294th District Court. Oncor stresses that people should not attempt to cut branches or trees at this time, as downed lines could still be electrified.  Everett said that the Trade Days grounds in Canton were not hit, but experienced some flooding, which has largely receded. She stressed people stay away from Canton, as the vendors are gone and no one will be allowed to enter. Everett said she plans to continue monitoring the situation and another press conference will be held at approximately 3 p.m. The FAA has restricted airspace over the Canton area temporarily due to disaster relief efforts.  Shelters Judge Kirkpatrick said that a shelter has been set up at 1st United Methodist Church in Canton. Also, those who have pets that need a safe place to be can take them to Sears Home Store, which is an animal shelter during this event.  He said that there are gas leaks, fences down, livestock out, power lines down, and other issues that will make traveling unsafe in Canton. He asked that everyone stay away from the area Sunday. Also, Kirkpatrick and Everett said that water conservation is required, until power is restored.  Power outages, road closures in East Texas after Saturday storms Injuries As of 6 a.m. on Sunday, April 30 the numbers for patients for ETMC hospitals from the Canton and Eustace tornadoes were as follows: ETMC Tyler patients: 2- critical condition, 1-fair condition, 1-good condition, 5- treated and released ETMC Athens: 36 total patients, 2 are in fair condition. The rest treated and released or transferred to ETMC Tyler. ETMC Cedar Creek Lake: 11 patients- treated/released They say the total number of those treated from tornadoes is 56. ETMC says 6 are still hospitalized and 2 of those are critical. The current death toll still stands at four. We will update this as information becomes available. This is a developing story, stay with KLTV.COM for more updates. KLTV 7 The National Weather Service (NWS) in Fort Worth confirmed that they will send a survey team to Canton Sunday and likely on Monday, as well. The NWS in Shreveport will send a team to the Mineola area on Monday.  The Red Cross has also set up a website to help people who are looking for loved ones or if you want to let loved ones know you are safe and well. Click here to see the website.  RELATED: +Eustace homes destroyed, family members hospitalized +IMAGES: Storms damages across ETX +Red Cross opens shelter for those affected in East Texas storms +Officials: 4 dead during weekend storms, casualties may increase +Power outages in East Texas after Saturday storms Copyright 2017 KLTV.

Ya Libnan Lebanon News and World News Live from Beirut Featured News Lebanon News World News Opinion Business News Arts & Culture Sci & Tech Video Apple’s cash pile of $250 billion fuels expectations April 30, 2017 by yalibnan Leave a Comment In its quarterly results on Tuesday, Apple Inc. likely will report that its cash hoard has topped a quarter of a trillion dollars, an unrivaled milestone for a private corporation that raises a question: Why would any company want to hold that much money? Apple has added to its pile at a blistering pace, doubling it in just over four-and-a-half years. In the last three months of 2016 it wracked up new cash at a rate of about $3.6 million an hour. Its current total, not accounting for debt, exceeds the market values of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and that of Procter & Gamble Co., and outstrips the foreign-currency reserves of the U.K. and Canada combined. The stash has drawn fresh attention recently as President Donald Trump tries to revamp the U.S. tax regime. Apple, like many big companies, keeps most of its cash offshore — some 93% of its $246.09 billion total cash, cash equivalents, and securities as of December — to avoid U.S. corporate taxes that executives consider too high. The Trump administration this week proposed a one-time tax holiday to encourage companies to bring that cash home, and said it wants to slash the U.S. corporate-income-tax rate to 15% from 35% and largely exempt future foreign profits. That could make it easier for Apple to put its money to use, through acquisitions or by doling out more to shareholders. The latter prospect has propelled Apple’s stock to record highs. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook early this year said he was eager to bring cash home if tax changes enable it, and Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said such a move would give Apple flexibility to do more capital returns. Neither has given detailed plans. One possible approach would be a special dividend. Apple could deliver such a windfall, benefitting investors including Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc., which more than doubled its Apple position in January. Wall Street analysts tend to focus more on companies’ net cash position than the headline number. Apple has racked up some $88 billion in debt to fund payouts to shareholders. But even subtracting that, Apple would be left with more cash than the total stockpile of Microsoft, the next richest tech company, which boasts $126 billion in cash, not accounting for debt. With the exception of financial companies, Apple’s stash exceeds that of any other U.S. company in recent history, said Jennifer Blouin, an accounting professor at University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School. “I have never seen a company in this kind of extreme position, barring a winding-down,” she said. “Apple’s a cash box right now.” Former executives say Apple’s thrift has deep roots, inspired in part by a brush with bankruptcy in the late 1990s. That forced Chief Executive Steve Jobs to arrange a cash infusion from Microsoft Corp. and set his resolve to keep reserves for future emergencies. Mr. Jobs also believed Apple could better boost its stock price by using its money to develop new products than through buybacks or dividends. His biggest product, the iPhone, has only supercharged the cash machine. Apple has sold more than 1 billion of the devices in the decade since it was introduced, and today claims 91% of all the profits in the smartphone sector. Mr. Cook has been somewhat more accommodating of shareholder desires than his predecessor. He started a dividend-and-stock-buyback program in 2012 that has since sent more than $200 billion to shareholders. And he has invested more in some areas, such as R&D. But the CEO also stared down Carl Icahn in 2013 and 2014 when the activist investor bought a stake in Apple and demanded it increase buybacks. And Apple remains frugal in other realms, such as marketing. It spent less than $1.8 billion on advertising last year — not even half the amounts laid out by smaller rivals Alphabet Inc. and Amazon.com Inc., according to company filings. Apple also avoids large acquisitions. It bought at a rate of 15 to 20 companies a year over the past four years, generally spending several hundred million dollars on companies it can easily assimilate. Its biggest deal was the $3 billion it spent to buy Beats Electronics LLC in 2014. The swelling war chest has fueled hopes for bigger deals to vault Apple in new directions such as self-driving cars and entertainment. At Apple’s 2015 shareholder meeting, one investor asked Mr. Cook about buying Tesla Inc., which today is valued around $51 billion. The CEO didn’t directly respond. Robert Nichols of Windward Capital Management Co., an Apple shareholder, says it should buy Netflix Inc., valued around $65 billion, to jumpstart its video-streaming business and bolster its position against Amazon. “You can either build [content and distribution] or you can buy it,” and buying would help Apple gain ground where it is behind, he said. With $250 billion, Apple could buy both Tesla and Netflix and still have plenty left over. It also might want to use some cash to pay down some of its debt or look to boost U.S. manufacturing after facing calls last year from then-President-elect Trump to build a plant in the U.S. Either way, there is a growing sense that Apple’s cash hoard has far outstripped its needs. “If this a rainy day fund, they’re saving for a millennial flood,” said Lee Pinkowitz, a Georgetown University professor of finance.   FOX Filed Under: Business News Featured News Gem TV’s Iranian CEO Saeed Karimian shot dead in Istanbul Turkey threatens further strikes on US-allied Syrian Kurds French election: Macron has already accomplished the unthinkable U.S.-backed militias claim big advance against IS in Syria’s Tabqa Lebanon News Speaker Berri proposed the creation of a Senate, to be headed by a Druze chairman PSP warns that sectarian electoral laws may lead to partitioning Lebanon The FPM,Hezbollah, Future, LF and PSP electoral law meeting failed , report ‘Israeli strike’ hits Hezbollah arms depot near Damascus, Syria airport- Report World News Trump: ‘One of the best chemistries I had was with’ Merkel UK snap election: What does it mean?

Club Store TV Coming Distractions The town of Twin Peaks hasn’t changed much in this very quick teaser By Sam Barsanti @sambarsanti Apr 30, 2017 2:32 PM It’s been almost 26 years since the end of Twin Peaks’ original run, and though most small towns in the real world would’ve probably been steamrolled to make room for a Walmart in that time, the eponymous town of Twin Peaks is looking surprisingly unchanged in this brief teaser for Showtime’s upcoming revival. In fact, you could watch all 30 seconds of this clip and not notice that it’s new footage, but reasonably sharp-eyed Twin Peaks fans will notice the string of modern cars parked outside of the Double R Diner, indicating that this is indeed the 2017 version of the town. (Extremely sharp-eyed fans might notice that, like, the trees are older or whatever, but we’ll stick with the cars.) Twin Peaks finally returns to TV screens on May 21, at which point we’ll hopefully get to see more than just various parking lots.

Greg Abbott said Sunday. The governor spoke during a press conference in Canton about emergency officials top priorities, including rescue and recovery. Abbott displayed a map showing the path of the tornadoes. Blue dots were marked on the map, indicating addresses where the storm hit. "I've seen the tragedy of what these tornadoes can do. ... We as Texans ... we've come together to respond to challenges like this to help our neighbors. Now is the time to come together," the governor said. Abbott encouraged people wanting to help to donate strategically, saying a monetary donation might be best. The county judge is expected to provide a location later today to send financial aid. The EMS Station in Canton at 600 Industrial is a location where goods may be dropped off. The affected area is under a curfew from dusk to dawn, according to the Van Zandt County judge, but the Canton mayor said that the city of Canton proper will not be under a curfew.  The mayor of Canton said that four people have been confirmed dead and that two people were still unaccounted for. Forty-nine people were taken to area hospitals and a triage remains open at Canton High School band hall. There will be a curfew for affected areas in the county. It will not include the city of Canton, officials said. WATCH LIVE: Press conference for Sunday afternoon tornado damage update At least four people were killed and ETMC says they have treated more than 50 people after Saturday tornadoes in Van Zandt County.  At a Canton Dodge dealership, a woman was found deceased. She is believed to have been in a vehicle on I-20. Off of Hwy 64 east of Canton, a man was found deceased in a pasture.  A Corsicana man died in a detached garage outside a mansion after the race car he was working on fell on him when the tornado hit. He was pronounced dead by a justice of the peace at 11 p.m. The JP said that this home was the scene of a wedding that had been planned for later in the evening, which, of course, did not occur. A man died after he was blown from his home on VZ CR 2434. His wife, who was sitting in a chair beside him at the time, was treated and released from a hospital with stitches and bruises.  During a press conference at 9:30 a.m. on Sunday, Canton Mayor Lou Ann Everett said that at least four fatalities have been confirmed. 49 injured people were taken to area hospitals, 16 of which were triaged at Canton High school, she said. County Judge Don Kirkpatrick said that search and rescue teams with K9s are going door to door in the area. He said that since first responders are still in the recovery stage, so volunteers are not being allowed in the area Sunday, though they are grateful for the willing people. Volunteers are going to be needed soon, however, he added. 7OnScene: Tracking storm damage across East Texas National Weather Service: 4 confirmed tornadoes hit East Texas, survey could take days Search and recovery was hindered on Saturday night by downed trees and power lines. More intensive efforts got underway at daybreak on Sunday. Mayor Everett said that the storm report she has received said the damage area is 35 miles wide, and 15 miles wide. She said that she signed a disaster declaration for Canton, and that she has been contacted by the state representative, state senator and other elected officials.  Everett said that Oncor is onsite, and staging at Walmart. There are at least 30 crews in the area. The hope is that power will be restored by midnight, but they will know more as the day progresses. Five major transformer poles were downed, she said, and some of those are difficult to access, so repairs could take time.  Cancellations Eustace and Fruitvale independent school districts have canceled classes Monday. Eustace says classes will resume Tuesday. The high school library pit will be open for people to charge their devices. Karen Wilson, district clerk for Van Zandt County said jury duty has been canceled Monday for the 294th District Court. Oncor stresses that people should not attempt to cut branches or trees at this time, as downed lines could still be electrified.  Everett said that the Trade Days grounds in Canton were not hit, but experienced some flooding, which has largely receded. She stressed people stay away from Canton, as the vendors are gone and no one will be allowed to enter. Everett said she plans to continue monitoring the situation and another press conference will be held at approximately 3 p.m. The FAA has restricted airspace over the Canton area temporarily due to disaster relief efforts.  Shelters Judge Kirkpatrick said that a shelter has been set up at 1st United Methodist Church in Canton. Also, those who have pets that need a safe place to be can take them to Sears Home Store, which is an animal shelter during this event.  He said that there are gas leaks, fences down, livestock out, power lines down, and other issues that will make traveling unsafe in Canton. He asked that everyone stay away from the area Sunday. Also, Kirkpatrick and Everett said that water conservation is required, until power is restored.  Power outages, road closures in East Texas after Saturday storms Injuries As of 6 a.m. on Sunday, April 30 the numbers for patients for ETMC hospitals from the Canton and Eustace tornadoes were as follows: ETMC Tyler patients: 2- critical condition, 1-fair condition, 1-good condition, 5- treated and released ETMC Athens: 36 total patients, 2 are in fair condition. The rest treated and released or transferred to ETMC Tyler. ETMC Cedar Creek Lake: 11 patients- treated/released They say the total number of those treated from tornadoes is 56. ETMC says 6 are still hospitalized and 2 of those are critical. The current death toll still stands at four. We will update this as information becomes available. This is a developing story, stay with KLTV.COM for more updates. KLTV 7 The National Weather Service (NWS) in Fort Worth confirmed that they will send a survey team to Canton Sunday and likely on Monday, as well. The NWS in Shreveport will send a team to the Mineola area on Monday.  The Red Cross has also set up a website to help people who are looking for loved ones or if you want to let loved ones know you are safe and well. Click here to see the website.  RELATED: +Eustace homes destroyed, family members hospitalized +IMAGES: Storms damages across ETX +Red Cross opens shelter for those affected in East Texas storms +Officials: 4 dead during weekend storms, casualties may increase +Power outages in East Texas after Saturday storms Copyright 2017 KLTV.

An anonymous reader quotes the Associated Press:The fallout from the YouTube boycott is likely to be felt through the rest of this year. Skittish advertisers have curtailed their spending until they are convinced Google can prevent their brands from appearing next to extremist clips promoting hate and violence... At one point, about 250 advertisers were boycotting YouTube... The list included big-spending marketers such as PepsiCo, Wal-Mart Stores, Starbucks, AT&T, Verizon, Johnson & Johnson, and Volkswagen. It's unclear how many, if any, of those have returned to YouTube since Google promised to hire more human reviewers and upgrade its technology to keep ads away from repugnant videos. Both Verizon and AT&T, two companies that are trying to expand their own digital ad networks to compete with Google, told The Associated Press that they are still boycotting YouTube. FX Networks confirmed that it isn't advertising on YouTube either. Several other boycotting marketers contacted by AP didn't respond. Thursday CEO Sundar Pichai told analysts that responding to the boycott, Google held "thousands and thousands" of conversations with advertisers, and one analyst now estimates reduced ad spending on YouTube and Google could cost the company $300 million this year alone. google youtube advertising ← Related Links → Humans Are Already Harassing Security Robots YouTube Loses Major Advertisers Over Offensive Videos Still More Advertisers Pull Google Ads Over YouTube Hate Videos Intel-Powered Broadband Modems Highly Vulnerable To DoS Attack Advertisers Are Still Boycotting YouTube Over Offensive Videos More | Reply Login Advertisers Are Still Boycotting YouTube Over Offensive Videos Post Load All Comments  Full  Abbreviated  Hidden /Sea Score: 5 4 3 2 1 0 -1 More | Reply Login   Nickname: Password: Public Terminal Forgot your password?

This project has a long history that led to the City Council’s April 4 passage of a resolution to move ahead with the taking of our private property — a clear abuse of the city’s eminent domain powers. Franklin Building Supply has had a retail store in Burley for decades, first under the name of Volco, and under the current name for the last 18 years. City officials are now publicly stating that my company has not responded to its efforts to negotiate or discuss the eminent domain, so I am compelled to offer our side of the story. First and foremost, these claims by the city are not true. We first heard rumors that the city wanted to put an exit road across the back of our property nearly 10 years ago. I can’t pin down the exact time because the outreach from the city was always verbal and made to local store managers, not me. At first, the idea was floated in a friendly way, but our gut response was what any Idahoan would expect when a government agency tells you they want to take away your private property rights so they can build a road: No way. But because we strive to be good citizens and neighbors, we were respectful and listened to what they had to say. Since no construction was imminent, and we didn’t want the road anyway, we waited for the city to approach us. Conversations continued to happen periodically over time, with city representatives saying they needed another exit for the Walmart in order to handle future traffic needs. It was always casual and friendly. Then, in 2010, we received a letter from the city that included a formal offer for the land needed for the road. We still did not want to sell our land, but we talked over the city’s offer and replied in writing with a counter proposal, which they rejected. We waited to see what they would do next and began to study how the proposal would negatively impact our daily business. About once a year since the 2010 letter, our manager would hear from someone from the city, again always casually. Then, in 2015, the tone changed and it became clear they wanted to move forward with the road. I scheduled a meeting in October 2015 at City Hall that included myself, another executive from our company, our company’s attorney, the city administrator, mayor, city attorney, and city engineer. Franklin laid out our objections, and we suggested solutions. In our view, making Third Street a through-way would bring a steady stream of traffic to the traffic light, essentially blocking the main entrance into our yard — terrible for our customers and vendors. We’d become essentially inaccessible to the public. The second problem was that the Third Street intersection would become considerably less safe for the public, with semi-trucks stacking up, waiting on Overland to turn right onto Third Street. The city listened respectfully, and I came away feeling like we had a good discussion. They said they would go to work on the issues we raised and get back to us, including possibly widening the Third Street entrance and moving our main yard entrance to decrease potential blockage. Even though we still felt putting in the Walmart driveway was a bad idea, we were still trying to be good, cooperative citizens. Ten months later, we finally heard from the city in a letter stating that they did not agree with our solutions. The letter included documents to sign to turn over our land, and they increased their purchase offer by $9,000. The letter explained our “rights” when the government uses eminent domain to take away private property. Get news headlines sent daily to your inbox Sign Up! I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site consitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy. We were shocked. We didn’t want to sell. We didn’t want this road because of the harm it would cause our business. Yet the city was essentially saying, Too bad, we are moving ahead. Despite years of conversation, this ultimatum seemed final, so we stopped communicating with them. For the city to imply that we have never responded to their outreach is disingenuous at best. At the April 4 City Council meeting, one of the councilors mentioned that he had promised D.L. Evans Bank that they would put in this road. In our nearly 10 years of discussions with the city, we never heard any mention that D.L. Evans Bank wanted this road. Had I ever heard this, I would have called the bank’s President John Evans to talk. Franklin prides itself on being great neighbors. When the bank needed help from us during the construction of their headquarters next door to our lumberyard, we were more than willing to help them out with space in our parking lot for construction activities. When they accidentally built over the lot line, we accommodated them with an easement. In any case, Burley residents deserve better from their city government. You deserve to know the truth because which business might be next? Private property rights are sacred in Idaho. When they are taken away involuntarily through a less-than-forthright process, we all should be concerned and hold elected officials accountable.

KTVB-TV reports a judge earlier this week rejected the request by 20-year-old Mario Garza. Garza and Ezri Garcia were charged after a June 2016 shootout at a Nampa Walmart where families had gathered to watch a fireworks show. The girl was struck in the shoulder, and surgeons were unable to remove the bullet due to possible nerve damage. Garza pleaded guilty in November to aggravated assault with a weapons enhancement and felony riot with a gang enhancement. He asked to withdraw his plea in February. He faces up to 18 years in prison at his sentencing next month. Garcia pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 19 years in prison.

Police say Cabrera made it into the home before officers arrived. Police say officers heard shots fired in the home when they got to the scene and that Cabrera fired at officers. Police say officers didn’t fire their weapons. Cabrera was taken into custody shortly after. Get breaking news sent instantly to your inbox Sign Up!

Wilder superintendent to run for Idaho schools chief BOISE (AP) — Wilder School Superintendent Jeff Dillon has filed to run for state superintendent of public instruction in 2018. Dillon, a Republican, is the first candidate to file for the position after current Superintendent of Public Instruction Sherri Ybarra announced she would also be seeking re-election. Dillon has worked as Wilder’s superintendent since 2012. Previously, he was an elementary school principal, and a middle school science and reading teacher. In 2014, the schools chief race attracted a wide range of candidates with mostly educator backgrounds and almost no political experience. Ybarra narrowly won the election despite facing a rocky campaign and raising little funds.

Print   Email   Font Resize Local News Communication with county of concern Comment from county planning commissioner sparks discussion at city council meeting By Sara Waite Journal-Advocate editor Posted:   04/28/2017 09:44:00 PM MDT The relationship between the Sterling Planning Commission and the Logan County Planning Commission was in the spotlight Tuesday night during the Sterling City Council meeting. During his report, City Manager Don Saling raised concern about a comment made at the last Logan County Planning Commission meeting by commission chair Dave Whitney. Whitney was talking about the requirement that when a permit application comes in for property along the city limits, the county is supposed to contact the city planning commission, and was quoted in the April 20 Journal-Advocate as saying, "whether they even want us to do that, 'cause I went to a meeting and they basically told me they didn't want anything to do with us." Saling said the comment raised some concerns "since we're trying to build a working relationship with the county and improving that relationship." " I guess I'm kind of asking if the city council would support communications to our planning commission to encourage them to have an open dialogue and a good communications process with Logan County," he said. "There are a lot of things that are happening on the edge of the city that will be coming to our planning commission as well as the city council, including a potential new big annexation and subdivision... I really think it's important to have good communications." Council member Bob McCarty expressed support for such a message to be sent to the planning commission. "We need to do everything we can to cooperate with the county," he said. Advertisement Mayor Dan Torres echoed that sentiment, saying "We need to work together." Both McCarty and Torres expressed surprise over Whitney's comment, with Torres saying "I couldn't believe it," and adding that he was concerned about that being the message the county planning commission chair took away from a meeting with the city planning commission. But at the last city planning commission meeting on April 5, commission member Linda Gebauer raised questions about a comment commission chair Stephen Bonham had made at the March 28 city council meeting about efforts to improve the relationship between the two commissions. Bonham told an unhappy Gebauer that he was speaking as an individual, not on behalf of the commission. She said she believed he should have done more to make clear he was not speaking for the commission. "This commission voted months ago that we were not going to pursue this line," she said. "It was evident the county certainly doesn't want to pursue this. And as I believe (Public Works Director) Mr. (George) Good had told us some time ago, if an issue comes up between the city and the county, that that is when there's communication, and there's meetings and that sort of thing." Other news from the city manager's report: • The Sterling Municipal Airport is now registered as an Aviation Development Zone (ADZ) with the Colorado Office of Economic Development and International Trade, which qualifies aviation manufacturing businesses with at least 10 full-time employees located within the zone for a state income tax credit of $1,200 per new employee. • Undergrounding of power lines along West Main Street between Walmart and Domino's is expected to start in the next few weeks. The bid for the project from Sturgeon Electric came in at $639,587, about $160,000 under estimate, and will be funded from the Xcel Energy 1 percent franchise agreement fee. • The Water Division is assisting on a water main replacement on N. Sixth Street. The contractor working on the roadway experienced numerous water main breaks and the decision was made to replace the line. • Scalva Farm recharge wells have been drilled and crews are setting up to do the piping and electrical work. • The annual citywide Spring Cleanup was running about two and a half days behind schedule due to the large amount of trash, weather conditions, and a truck breakdown. Saling also noted the Sterling Police Department's Drug Take Back Day from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Saturday, and the I Am Healthy Northeast Health Fest at Sterling Middle School from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Saturday.

Adolfo Laborde, an expert in international relations and once a visiting scholar at Fudan University in Shanghai, said he learned to use his phone to get groceries, book train tickets or rent a bicycle -- all through the instant messaging app WeChat, which integrates a whole bunch of daily activities. "You use it as a means of payment. You have your bank account information there and you use the mobile phone for everything," said Laborde, who lived in Shanghai during the second half of 2016. As of December 2016, the number of Internet users in China had reached 731 million, more than the entire population of Europe, and some 95 percent of netizens, or 695 million people, connect to the web via mobile devices, data from China's Internet Network Information Center shows. In addition, 469 million Chinese are used to making payments via mobile phones, and 208 million use it to order takeout food. E-commerce transactions in China amounted to 21.8 billion yuan (3.2 billion U.S. dollars) in 2015. The figure is expected to reach 38 billion yuan (5.5 billion dollars) by 2020. E-commerce boosts consumption, said Laborde, because apps make it so much easier to make purchases without cash. Online transactions often offer added benefits as well, such as discounts or special promotions. The rise in online retail sales has been accompanied by the advancement of logistics as the goods have to be delivered to the customers. In densely populated Shanghai, for instance, that has led to a flourishing of delivery companies, which use specially adapted bikes or motorbikes to carry big or large numbers of items for efficiency's sake. "The logistics is impressive," said Laborde, "with collection points at (street) corners. It shows the domestic market is moving through this e-commerce." According to analysts at The Financial Times, online purchases represented 18 percent of all retail sales in China in 2016, while in the United States that number was 8 percent. Jorge Sanchez Tello, a researcher at the Foundation for Financial Studies at Autonomous Technological Institute of Mexico, said the growth of online shopping in the world's second-largest economy has been driven by an expanding middle class and broadband network. Tello said the one-day transaction on Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba's online shopping sites on so-called Singles' Day in 2014 was equivalent to the sales of an entire quarter at Walmart in Mexico. In 2009, Alibaba first turned the Nov.11 "Singles' Day," originally a popular concept celebrated somewhat self-mockingly by unmarried Chinese youth, to an online shopping carnival for all in a bid to promote sales. Its sales on that day did experience exponential growth successively in the ensuing years. In Mexico's case, Laborde said, e-commerce still faces two major hurdles -- online security and logistical challenges. Public distrust in online activities also plays a part. "There is a lot of distrust. People still think their information will be stolen, because it happens, and deliveries are slow," Laborde said. Online purchases in Mexico grew by 59 percent from 2014 to 2015, with sales of over 257 billion pesos (13.606 million dollars), according to the Mexican Internet Association.

(Shallan Knowles / EVERCANNABIST Correspondent) By Dan Webster EVERCANNABIS Correspondent Twitter Facebook  Email  Reddit  SMS Wondering where to stock up on your smoking accessories? Try these options. Piece of Mind locations are at 9003 N. Division, 4103 N. Division and 2910 E. 29th Avenue in Spokane and120101 E. 1st Avenue in Spokane Valley. www.pieceofmind.net/ Zanies locations are at 12928 E. Indiana Avenue in Spokane Valley and 1214 W. Knox Avenue in Spokane. www.spokanezanies.com/ Sedated Smoke Shop,1228 W Northwest Blvd Suite A, Spokane, WA 99205, sedatedsmokeshop.godaddysites.com/ Time was, you could look in the Spokane phone book and see listings for a couple dozen ‘head shops.’ These days, what with the proliferation of legalized cannabis retail stores, places to purchase your pipes, rolling papers, ashtrays and other tools and accessories are less common. Oh, you can still find them. You know the kinds of stores: places where, to the strains of a reggae tune, you can find an array of pipes, bongs and various other types of drug-culture merchandise – accompanied by signs declaring “These products are intended for tobacco use only.” Those signs are important because, as Renee Salib said, even head shops – which do NOT sell cannabis – have to abide by the same laws that apply to tobacco sales. “We operate under the Washington State tobacco laws,” said Salib, owner of Zanies, a retailer that has done business in different locations around Spokane since 1972. “Federally speaking, marijuana is still illegal. We’ve been around that block a lot of times. We operate in compliance with them. Anything we sell is for legal purposes only.” Of course – wink-wink – what you, the consumer, choose to pack into, say, a recently purchased hand-made, glass-blown pipe is your own concern. Stepping into either Zanies location, whether in Spokane Valley or just off Northwest Boulevard, is like making a trek back in time. The North Side site in particular feels like something out of the movie “Woodstock,” with the permeating smell of incense, racks of tie-dyed T-shirts, banner-lined walls and shelves featuring “one-of-a-kind” glassware. “We just don’t have our long hair anymore,” said Bob Salib, Renee’s husband. Bob laughs as he says this, but when addressing pretty much everything else concerning their business he and Renee are perfectly serious. In the course of talking about marijuana legislation, and how state (not to mention federal) officials are making a mistake by not promoting even more extensive use of cannabis products, the couple makes a surprising disclosure: marijuana legalization hasn’t helped their business. “Actually, our business has shrunk,” Renee said. The reason: “Simply because there’s so much more competition.” That competition, she says, comes only partly from the 33 retailers doing business in Spokane County. State laws restrict what kind of merchandise those retail outlets can carry. Some do carry pipes, but most focus more on cannabis products. “They can’t even sell incense,” Renee said. The competition Zanies faces comes more from specialty national stores such as Spencer’s, which offers a range of party accessories and supplies, and larger retailers. Wal-Mart, for example, sells lava lamps for less than what the Salibs can buy them for at wholesale prices. So, Renee says, like other old-school head shops across the state, they’ve had to diversify. It offers more choices in incense, clothing, and glassware. Zanies sells hand-blown glass made by local artist Robbie Mosher, who makes everything from pipes to figurines. Spokane-area shoppers also can find similar types of products at Peace of Mind, which has four local locations along with shops in Alaska, California, Montana and Oregon. The Zanies team says with all the competition, pleasing customers needs to come first. “Our main focus has always been customer service,” Renee said. “We’re your one-stop hippie shop.” This attitude and being able to adapt to an ever-changing marketplace has allowed Zanies to keep alive a business that began when Renee’s mother and stepfather, Lynn and John Woods, invested $500 to open the original store at the intersection of Division and Buckeye streets. “We’re the third generation serving four generations now,” Renee says. “If you wrap your head around that, I’ve got people bringing in their grandkids who knew my mother 40 years ago.” Some people clearly can’t own enough tie-dyed T-shirts. Wink-wink.

Compare college presidents I think the BND should examine the salaries of the presidents of the various colleges in the metro-east. Compare their salaries to the student population of the schools they run. You’ll find huge discrepancies in salaries and benefits. This is one of the reasons why school systems are having trouble making ends meet. MidAmerica math G. Brooks’ Letter to the Editor tried to put a positive spin on MidAmerica Airport. Brooks is very enthusiastic about spending more taxpayer money on the airport, but he forgot the most important fact: The St Clair County taxpayers waste $10 million or more every year to support an airport that has never and will never bring in one penny of revenue. Continued criticisms, Brooks? More like common business sense, especially when Kern turns his failure over to the federal government. Inhumane Madison County Madison County Animal Control routinely kills healthy, adoptable dogs and cats when they have empty cages. The County Board unanimously passed a no kill resolution so the chairman needs to stop that inhumane practice now. The county doesn’t even have an adoption program. St. Clair County Animal Control is more humane. Erase slave owners Bravo to New Orleans for removing Confederate era statues. Don’t stop there. Let’s remove the Washington Monument and Jefferson Memorial. Take all of the slave owners off every monument. According to today’s standards, every colonialist is in the wrong and we should change it. Their portraits should be burned and destroyed similar to how Hitler burned all the books. That way, all of the historical stuff will be gone and the so-called “non-racist” Americans will be happy. Forget about our forefathers, they were all slave owners anyway. Red flags on green Red flags are flying all over the Kellers’ finances and the Hofbräuhaus. Too bad for Belleville and the tax payers that Eckert and his TIF clowns are color blind, causing them to only see green. Keep info open On election night, the BND posted a video of Mayor Eckert’s victory party. During it, Victoria Eckert was bragging that Jennifer Gain Meyer, the incoming city clerk, was inheriting an office chair that was rarely used. For all of the criticism of Dallas Cook, let’s applaud him for making information more accessible. I hope that Meyer doesn’t fall to the whims of her new boss, Eckert, and suppress information. Kern’s bobbleheads BND exposes eight Democrat patronage jobs, called St. Clair County Public Building Commission, or should we say “Kern bobbleheads.” BND reports the St Clair Country Board Members, another 26 Kern bobbleheads, approve a property tax increase. Kern spits in the voter’s face and gets his tax increase anyway. The real question is how many part-time patronage jobs are there in St. Clair County? These bobbleheads get free medical care and at least $11,000 a year for part-time work. What other tax payer funded benefits do these minimal work patronage jobs provide? How much does it cost the tax payer to have 40 or more Kern bobbleheads show up for a monthly meeting? $300,000 or $500,000 per year? What a waste of my tax money. Budget lesson The St. Clair County Board has decided that a tax increase will fix all our problems. That’s not the way budgeting is done. We need to find out how much money we have and then adjust our expenses to fit that. You don’t keep going back to get more water from the well. They don’t care about us and can’t control their spending. Voters need to remember this and never vote for an incumbent again. Senior celebration I’m going to go out tonight and celebrate the property tax increase by the St. Clair County Board by going out to dine at an area restaurant on a Happy Meal and the best coffee a senior can get. Queen of scams? Two weeks ago the Caseyville VFW Queen of Hearts drawing for over $300,000 rolled over because the “organizers” could not decipher John’s last name on the ticket. None of them would call the phone number, which was legible. Naturally, they do not allow address labels on the ticket, which would prevent such a fiasco. Thousands of dollars flow through this building weekly in alcohol sales and 50/50 drawings. The VFW is a noble organization, but it seems like they could do a better job of running the game. Heroin not fated State’s attorney Kelly didn’t do his homework when suing the pharmaceutical companies. Being a chronic pain individual myself, I am on opioid pain medication and have no desire to misuse it or use heroin. About 15 years ago, I was seeing a doctor in Belleville who prescribed opioids for seven years for menstrual cramps. When I told people that he gave me opioid for cramps, they were shocked. He never gave me a warning about it being addictive, not one word. He stopped prescribing them after I was hooked and I was able to quit without turning to heroin. It is beating a dead horse to claim that anybody quitting opioids will turn to heroin. Balance without pain? Belleville’s Mary Ann Maserang’s plea for fairness in our efforts to tighten our financial belt will fall on deaf ears. Nearly all taxpayers seem to want a balanced budget but no one wants to surrender even a piece of their pet perks to get us there. What liberals added to the budget in the past as social programs are now looked at as entitlements. Claims create rates The fourth firehouse in Belleville is a good thing. You want as much fire protection as you can get. The biggest problem is that nearly all insurance companies raise people’s rates yearly. Not because of your city’s fire department rating, but as regional rates. If they have a large amount of claims in a certain part of the country, then everyone’s insurance goes up. Even though we may have a better fire department rating, insurance will go up because of regional rates. Marissa silence Marissa had a clean-up week but none of the village residents knew about it. We had a recent election and I still don’t know who won. The village hall hasn’t put out any information or newsletters. Yet, they want the village nice and clean for the yard sale that’s coming up. The mayor needs to think about more transparency for the people who elected him. Durbin’s a joke I stand with President Trump’s view on sanctuary cities. Senator Durbin believes that sanctuary cities should remain in Illinois. Since 2016, Chicago has been a sanctuary city. Plenty of extremists and activists are in the state with their right or wrong views. Why do our schools have to cut costs to maintain sanctuary cities in Illinois? How long is Springfield going to take to pass a budget? This is political slavery. I know a joke when I see one and that’s Durbin. Let Durbin pay I just got off the phone with Senator Durbin’s people. I asked why Durbin wants Chicago to be a sanctuary city. He didn’t have an answer. My proposal is: Senator Durbin or any other congressman should create sanctuary cities within the countries that need help. Fund it out of your own pockets, congressmen. This way, you don’t break up their families. I think they want to stay in their own countries, but they can’t afford to do it. Walters on Wal-Mart Even ill-tempered Jim Walters has a right to his own opinion as recently voiced in his letter to the BND. While Bob Romanik is a public figure and thus an eligible target for ridicule, Walters shouldn’t draw innocent local businesses into the fray. In Walters’ vain attempt to disparage Romanik, Walmart and its fine employees were unfortunate collateral damage. Romanik’s rapport Bob Romantik claims to be a champion of freedom of speech. He’s always throwing mud at the BND called it the “News Slime-o-crat.” When someone calls his show, if you don’t agree with what he has to say, he cuts you off and insults you and your mother. He’s not a patriot or a champion of anything but himself. Re-election a mistake Did anybody even check to see if the businesses backing the Shrine project were legit? I don’t think so. Now, after the elections, we have the same city administration in Belleville that we’ve always had— giving away TIF money and raising taxes. Residents of Belleville, you messed up re-electing Eckert. This project is never going to happen. Show us the plans What’s going on with the lawsuit filed against the Hofbräuhaus to let people see the plans? I understand that there’s a second lawsuit now over related documents. Interesting that the Kellers are in financial troubles, Belleville is in the middle of it and won’t let anybody look at the plans. It’s pathetic, Eckert, that you won’t let people look at the plans of a project that you brag about. BND, please look into this. Taxes to TIF I’d like to know how much of the property tax increase is going straight into TIF funds. St. Louis control The St. Louis Police Chief retired after meeting with the new mayor. This is not a good sign for the city. The chief was doing a fine job with the department, giving the officers what they needed to do their jobs. Now, under a new mayor, the chief suddenly quits. This should raise a red flag. The new mayor must want control of everything, no matter how well they’re doing their jobs. I bet the fire chief will be the next one to go. School bus reckless I followed a school bus from Illinois 159 and Highway 50 all the way into Swansea. The bus driver was tailgating cars. I was driving 40-45 mph but he was going faster and following too closely. Whoever is in charge, they need to talk to that driver. He is going to get into a wreck and injure children if someone doesn’t do something.

Spencer Soper Amazon’s first-quarter sales increased 23% to $35.7 billion. Photo: Reuters Seattle: Amazon.com Inc.’s unbroken 20-year streak of double-digit revenue growth shows no sign of slowing this year, helped by an influx of online shoppers who are abandoning stores and new business for its cloud-computing division. The company topped profit and revenue estimates in the first quarter and projected sales that may beat projections in the current period, reinforcing its message to investors that big spending on warehouses, movies and devices are all part of a winning formula. “Amazon appears to be firing on all cylinders,” said Colin Sebastian, an analyst at Robert W. Baird & Co. “The core e-commerce segment growth remains very healthy, Amazon Web Services was fairly stable even with the recent price reductions, and growth in subscription services and advertising is robust, starting to move the needle, and helping to augment profitability.” Shares gained as much as 5.1% in extended trading after closing Thursday at a record $918.76 in New York. The stock has jumped 23% this year. The world’s largest online retailer is dominating e-commerce in the US with its $99-a-year Amazon Prime subscription, which includes delivery discounts, music and video streaming and photo storage that keep shoppers engaged with the website. Seattle-based Amazon had 80 million Prime subscribers in the US as of 31 March, an increase of 36% from a year earlier, according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. Prime memberships help lock in loyalty, which is critical as competitors such as Walmart Stores Inc. enhance their e-commerce offerings to slow Amazon’s momentum. Amazon Web Services, its cloud-computing division, subsidizes the company’s spending for various initiatives such as expanding into India and Australia, speeding up delivery times to as little as an hour on select products, adding new skills and devices for its voice-activated Alexa platform and producing original movies and shows. First-quarter sales increased 23% to $35.7 billion. Net income was $724 million, or $1.48 a share, the company said in a statement. Analysts estimated profit of $1.08 a share on revenue of $35.3 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Amazon Web Services revenue gained 43% to $3.66 billion. That’s slower than 47% year-over-year growth in the previous quarter. A combination of better profit margins in the cloud-computing unit and a smaller increase in shipping costs helped Amazon beat earnings projections, said Josh Olson, analyst at Edward Jones & Co. Amazon Web Services had a profit margin of 24.3% in the first quarter, compared with 23.5% a year earlier. Shipping expenses, a major cost for Amazon, increased by 30%, the slowest pace in at least six quarters, Olson said. Still, company spending remains an investor concern. Operating expenses rose 24% to $34.7 billion in the quarter. “They earned $724 million on $35.7 billion in sales, or a whopping 2%,” said Michael Pachter, analyst at Wedbush Securities. “Sales grew by $6.6 billion and net income grew by $200 million. They’re playing mind games with us.” Amazon on Thursday forecast operating income in the current quarter of $425 million to $1.08 billion on net sales of $35.3 billion to $37.8 billion. That compares with operating income of $1.29 billion on sales of $30.4 billion in the same period a year ago. Analysts projected sales of $36.9 billion in the current quarter.

Here's what's known about the plan, which Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and National Economic Council director Gary Cohn debuted at a press conference, and its chances of eventually becoming law. It's only a loose outline This isn't like health care, where Speaker Paul Ryan put out a full bill ready to go with the White House's backing. The White House's tax plan leaves out a lot of important details, including basic information like which income ranges would fall into which tax brackets. Mnuchin said it represented their "core principles" but that they would fill in the rest with Congress.

Mnuchin boasted the proposal included "massive tax cuts" that would boost the economy. For individual taxes, it would shrink the number of brackets to three rates: 10 percent, 25 percent and 35 percent and double the standard deduction. Related: Here's What We Know About Those Tax Cuts But it would also raise revenue elsewhere by eliminating all deductions besides the ones on charitable donations and mortgage interest. The most contentious one to go would be the deduction on state and local taxes, which would disproportionately affect people in states and cities with higher tax rates. For corporate taxes, it would drop the current top rate of 35 percent to just 15 percent. Companies would be taxed under a territorial system in which they're only liable for income earned in America rather than the current worldwide system, which leaves them on the hook for income earned abroad as well. There would also be an unspecified one-time tax on corporate money held overseas. Especially notable is that the plan would allow "pass-through" entities, which let business owners treat their revenue as individual income, to qualify for the same 15 percent rate. It's big How big is unclear without more details, but outside groups estimated Trump's relatively similar campaign plan would have cost trillions of dollars and his new one is likely to do the same.

By his rough estimate, the new plan's new cuts would reduce revenues between $4 trillion and $6 trillion over the next decade while its offsets would bring in about $2.5 trillion. Mnuchin argues the plan will "pay for itself" by raising economic growth, but Cole is skeptical that's the case without significantly limiting its cuts. Maya MacGuineas, a leading fiscal hawk who heads the non-partisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, accused the White House in a statement of "using economic growth like magic beans" to hide their costs. Her group's early estimate of Trump's plan pegs its cost at $5.5 trillion without further offsets. People like Trump would benefit a lot "Pass-through" entities tend to benefit wealthy people like Trump, whose business empire includes a series of pass-throughs in which profits flow to him. The 15 percent rate would give the rich a giant incentive to route their income through pass-throughs to avoid the much higher 35 percent top rate on individual income. Mnuchin addressed this and said the White House would find a way to avoid letting wealthy people avoid paying higher rates, but he offered no details and some tax experts are skeptical this would be easy to accomplish in practice. "Ultimately, wealthy people with the best tax advisers will find ways around those rules," Lily Batchelder, a professor of law and public policy at New York University, told NBC News. The plan repeals the Alternative Minimum Tax, which is designed to ensure high earners pay at least some taxes even if they claim a large number of deductions. Trump's 2005 tax return, which journalist David Cay Johnston obtained in March, shows he paid $38 million in taxes on $152 million in income, but $31 million of his tax payment was due to the AMT. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin speaks about the administration's tax reform plan during The Hill's Newsmaker Series at the Newseum in Washington on April 26. Saul Loeb / AFP - Getty Images Trump would eliminate the estate tax, which only affects inheritances larger than $5.5 million for individuals and $11 million for families and could save his children tremendous amounts of money. His plan would also remove a 3.8 percent surcharge on investment income created by the Affordable Care Act that only affects higher income taxpayers. By comparison, it's likely the benefits to middle and lower income taxpayers will be much more modest. While not a perfect comparison, an analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center of Trump's campaign plan found that the average gains for the top 0.1 percent of earners would be 14 percent of their after-tax income, versus just 1.8 percent for the middle fifth of earners and 0.8 percent for the poorest fifth. Depending on the details, Batchelder calculated that the proposed changes to deductions could increase taxes for many middle-income and lower-income taxpayers, including single-parent households and families with multiple children. Trump's tax returns are going to be an issue How much would Trump benefit from these changes? There's no way to know for sure. Trump has refused to make public his tax returns, breaking from decades of White House tradition, and Mnuchin said he had "no intention" to do so in the future. Democrats are already making this lack of information a key criticisms, saying the release of his returns should be a prerequisite for debating a package. It drops a crucial House Republican idea House and Senate GOP leaders put out a statement praising the president's proposals as "critical guideposts" and saying they shared the same goals of lowering rates and simplifying the tax code. But they're not all on the same page. Trump's plan abandoned a key part of the House Republican tax plan known as the border adjustment tax, which would have given greater tax preferences to American companies who primarily export goods in comparison to companies who import goods. The border adjustment tax provision divided the business community, with more import-heavy companies like Wal-Mart opposed and more export-heavy companies like Boeing supportive of the idea, and Republicans were split as well. But House GOP leaders argued it was necessary to raise revenue to help pay for the lower tax rates. Without it, some are skeptical they can afford deep cuts. "I'm a big supporter of the (border adjustment tax)," Rep. Chris Collins, R-New York, a key Trump ally, told reporters on Wednesday. "If you take it out, that's all fine and good, but somebody's got to show me its still revenue neutral." Procedural rules could make it hard to pass Many Republicans are, like Trump, happy to assume big GDP growth from tax cuts will take care of concerns about the deficit even if most mainstream economists disagree. But another big reason Republicans are worried about offsetting cuts to corporate tax rates is procedural and it could complicate efforts to pass a bill. Just as they tried to do with health care legislation, Republicans are using a procedure called budget reconciliation that lets them pass a bill with only a simple majority in the Senate. The advantage is that they don't have to negotiate with Democrats, who Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said he plans to ignore, but it comes with rules that limit what they can do.

This is why the Bush tax cuts, which passed through reconciliation, were only temporary. So could Trump do the same and settle for a major ten-year cut? There's actually more potential trouble: even temporary corporate tax cuts might allow companies to roll over savings beyond the ten-year window, thus increasing the deficit and triggering the Byrd Rule, which would scuttle a reconciliation bill. Ryan's own senior tax counsel, George Callas, warned at a panel discussion last week that the Byrd Rule made temporary tax cuts, even as short as three years, impossible without offsets. "Not only can that not pass Congress, it cannot even begin to move through Congress," Callas said. All of this creates a mess that could pit Republicans against the Congressional Budget Office and Joint Committee on Taxation, which normally score legislation, and potentially create a showdown over Senate rules.

Police say Ager Mohsin Hasan, 24, fled the country and is wanted in her death. Vasilije’s body was found on the floor of her Kitchener apartment early Friday morning. Later that day, police in tactical gear stormed a third floor unit of a Hamilton apartment. As many as 20 officers were involved, as well as a canine unit. Sources tell CTV they were looking for Hasan, who they say visited his father in the building regularly and was last seen there Thursday evening. Police say Hasan drove a black 2016 HR-V and was seen crossing into the United States via the Peace Bridge at Fort Erie, Ont. the next day, the same day Vasilije’s remains were discovered. Hours later, a person matching Hasan’s description was seen removing a licence plate from a vehicle in the parking lot of a Walmart in Harborcreek, Pa., according to state police. The person was then seen attaching the plate to a black HR-V before leaving the scene. In a statement to CTV, Vasilije’s family said she was a talented hairstylist and a positive, family-oriented person. Police say a postmortem confirms the cause of death as multiple stab wounds. The Waterloo Regional Police Service says their investigators are continuing to liaise with U.S. law enforcement in an effort to track down Hasan, who is considered dangerous. With reporting from CTV's Nicole Lampa Photos Ager Mohsin Hasan, 24, is wanted in the death of 22-year-old Melinda Vasilije.

(Photo by Cindy Yamanaka, Orange County Register/SCNG) Show Caption of Expand Brick-and-mortar merchants seem to be dying. And teen-targeted retailing is even more troubled. And California, as certain logic goes, isn’t the greatest place in the world to do business. So, what is a discount retailer with a youthful audience doing opening 12 stores in a month in Southern California with plans to make the state its top market? “We couldn’t be more excited to come to California,” says Joel Anderson, the CEO of Five Below, a fast-growing chain from Philadelphia that’s making the splashy debut. “It’s a perfect opportunity. There are no worries on our end about California.” It’s a curious shopping concept. Dare I say, a fancier dollar store where nothing costs more than $5. Hence, its name. Selling goes on in a setting that’s bright and a bit loud, much like the vibe of other teen-targeted stores. The products include arty household goods, assorted knickknacks, electronic gadgetry, sportswear, beach toys and snacks — with much of it seemingly perfect for gift-giving. Well, at least to these middle-aged shopper’s eyes. Plus, there’s a healthy supply of plugs and chargers for mobile devices that always seem to get misplaced! So, why the big jump to California when the previous most-Western store was in Oklahoma? Stores opened in April in Aliso Viejo, Anaheim, Compton, Fontana, Hawthorne, Montebello, Rancho Cucamonga, Redlands and South Gate. Openings in San Dimas, Lancaster and South Fontana are slated for May. Well, it probably helps that the CEO knows California. Anderson is an Orange County native and graduated from Fountain Valley High School. His professional career included work at Toys r Us and heading up Wal-Mart’s online shopping operations. Did I mention his Harvard MBA? Five Below plans to roughly quadruple from its current 549 stores to roughly 2,000 at its peak. Anderson believes California will become this chain’s No. 1 market, usurping Texas. He sees only one noteworthy headache growing in California: “Our biggest challenge is finding centers that have space for us.” Five Below’s chainwide sales grew 20 percent last year to $1 billion, though one sign of the tough retailing environment: sales at existing stores grew by only 2 percent. Profits rose 24 percent to $72 million. To me, a veteran bargain hunter, Five Below has a reasonable chance at success. For one, $5 is a much more logical price point for discount stores. Let’s face it, many dollar stores now sell stuff for more than a buck. Plus, Five Below has an entertainment quotient – making the time in the store relatively pleasant. Of course, Five Below executives may need a map. It bugged this consumer to see the Anaheim store last week stocked with items emblazoned with icons of Los Angeles and Dallas and the logo of – boo! – hockey’s LA Kings. The fate of in-store shopping has yet to be determined. But I have to agree with CEO Anderson when he said, “To be successful you have got to offer value and you have got to offer a great store experience.” If the time a shopper spends in a store isn’t functional or fun, online purchasing will win out. Perhaps, Five Below has a solution. Get the latest news delivered daily!

On Friday, police investigated a suspicious death they believe was a targeted incident on Country Hill Drive in Kitchener. A 24-year-old Hamilton man has been charged with second-degree murder in connection with the death of a 22-year-old Kitchener woman, and a Canada-wide warrant has been issued for his arrest.  Waterloo Regional Police have charged 24-year-old Ager Mohsin Hasan, but are working to try to locate him, after he may have been spotted in Pennsylvania.  Police investigate suspicious death on Kitchener's Country Hill Drive Police were called to an apartment building on Country Hill Drive around 3:00 a.m. Friday where they found a 22-year-old woman who was deceased. Waterloo Regional Police told CBC News in an email that a post-mortem conducted on Friday determined the cause of death was multiple stab wounds. According to a release from the Pennsylvania State Police, a person matching Hasan's description was seen removing a Pennsylvania licence plate from a vehicle at about 10:18 a.m. Friday at a Walmart on Buffalo Road in Harbourcreek Township, PA. State police said the licence plate is Pennsylvania registration EZV1654 and had a Fraternal Order of Police medallion emblem attached to it. They allege Hasan attached a stolen licence plate to a black Honda HRV and fled the scene. The Honda HRV may have also been displaying Ontario licence plate BPKT509. Inspector Haffner said investigators are continuing to work with U.S. law enforcement agencies.

CLOUD – A committed group of volunteers braved the cold dreary weather to get Wilson Park ready for the Governor’s fishing opener. The dozen volunteers met at Wilson Regional Park Sunday morning to pick up trash and recycling. Twenty-three-year-old Katie Weber, a recent UW-Madison grad, organized the clean-up. She says the event was organized this weekend to correspond with the upcoming Governor’s fishing opener. “I actually contacted Scott Zlotnik with the parks and rec department about doing this, and he said he would really appreciate it if we did it around April- May to prepare for the fishing opener.” Wilson Park is just one of a few areas she hopes to organize clean-up initiatives. She says her next goal is to get a group together to clean up another St. Cloud area park. “I want to expand it and do more parks. The next park I am thinking about doing is Hester Park by Wal-Mart. It is pretty bad over there.” Weber’s love of the environment has rubbed off on the people around her, as most of the volunteers are work friends or family. The group concentrated on the river’s edge, and wooded areas of Wilson Regional Park. After just one hour of work the volunteers had filled seven bags of garbage. The city of St. Cloud provided garbage bags and gloves for the volunteers. Katie Weber and other volunteers cleaning up Wilson park.

Greg Abbott said Sunday. The governor spoke during a press conference in Canton about emergency officials top priorities, including rescue and recovery. Abbott displayed a map showing the path of the tornadoes. Blue dots were marked on the map, indicating addresses where the storm hit. "I've seen the tragedy of what these tornadoes can do. ... We as Texans ... we've come together to respond to challenges like this to help our neighbors. Now is the time to come together," the governor said. Abbott encouraged people wanting to help to donate strategically, saying a monetary donation might be best. The county judge is expected to provide a location later today to send financial aid. The EMS Station in Canton at 600 Industrial is a location where goods may be dropped off. The affected area is under a curfew from dusk to dawn, according to the Van Zandt County judge, but the Canton mayor said that the city of Canton proper will not be under a curfew.  The mayor of Canton said that four people have been confirmed dead and that two people were still unaccounted for. Forty-nine people were taken to area hospitals and a triage remains open at Canton High School band hall. There will be a curfew for affected areas in the county. It will not include the city of Canton, officials said. WATCH LIVE: Press conference for Sunday afternoon tornado damage update At least four people were killed and ETMC says they have treated more than 50 people after Saturday tornadoes in Van Zandt County.  At a Canton Dodge dealership, a woman was found deceased. She is believed to have been in a vehicle on I-20. Off of Hwy 64 east of Canton, a man was found deceased in a pasture.  A Corsicana man died in a detached garage outside a mansion after the race car he was working on fell on him when the tornado hit. He was pronounced dead by a justice of the peace at 11 p.m. The JP said that this home was the scene of a wedding that had been planned for later in the evening, which, of course, did not occur. A man died after he was blown from his home on VZ CR 2434. His wife, who was sitting in a chair beside him at the time, was treated and released from a hospital with stitches and bruises.  During a press conference at 9:30 a.m. on Sunday, Canton Mayor Lou Ann Everett said that at least four fatalities have been confirmed. 49 injured people were taken to area hospitals, 16 of which were triaged at Canton High school, she said. County Judge Don Kirkpatrick said that search and rescue teams with K9s are going door to door in the area. He said that since first responders are still in the recovery stage, so volunteers are not being allowed in the area Sunday, though they are grateful for the willing people. Volunteers are going to be needed soon, however, he added. 7OnScene: Tracking storm damage across East Texas National Weather Service: 4 confirmed tornadoes hit East Texas, survey could take days Search and recovery was hindered on Saturday night by downed trees and power lines. More intensive efforts got underway at daybreak on Sunday. Mayor Everett said that the storm report she has received said the damage area is 35 miles wide, and 15 miles wide. She said that she signed a disaster declaration for Canton, and that she has been contacted by the state representative, state senator and other elected officials.  Everett said that Oncor is onsite, and staging at Walmart. There are at least 30 crews in the area. The hope is that power will be restored by midnight, but they will know more as the day progresses. Five major transformer poles were downed, she said, and some of those are difficult to access, so repairs could take time.  Cancellations Eustace and Fruitvale independent school districts have canceled classes Monday. Eustace says classes will resume Tuesday. The high school library pit will be open for people to charge their devices. Karen Wilson, district clerk for Van Zandt County said jury duty has been canceled Monday for the 294th District Court. Oncor stresses that people should not attempt to cut branches or trees at this time, as downed lines could still be electrified.  Everett said that the Trade Days grounds in Canton were not hit, but experienced some flooding, which has largely receded. She stressed people stay away from Canton, as the vendors are gone and no one will be allowed to enter. Everett said she plans to continue monitoring the situation and another press conference will be held at approximately 3 p.m. The FAA has restricted airspace over the Canton area temporarily due to disaster relief efforts.  Shelters Judge Kirkpatrick said that a shelter has been set up at 1st United Methodist Church in Canton. Also, those who have pets that need a safe place to be can take them to Sears Home Store, which is an animal shelter during this event.  He said that there are gas leaks, fences down, livestock out, power lines down, and other issues that will make traveling unsafe in Canton. He asked that everyone stay away from the area Sunday. Also, Kirkpatrick and Everett said that water conservation is required, until power is restored.  Power outages, road closures in East Texas after Saturday storms Injuries As of 6 a.m. on Sunday, April 30 the numbers for patients for ETMC hospitals from the Canton and Eustace tornadoes were as follows: ETMC Tyler patients: 2- critical condition, 1-fair condition, 1-good condition, 5- treated and released ETMC Athens: 36 total patients, 2 are in fair condition. The rest treated and released or transferred to ETMC Tyler. ETMC Cedar Creek Lake: 11 patients- treated/released They say the total number of those treated from tornadoes is 56. ETMC says 6 are still hospitalized and 2 of those are critical. The current death toll still stands at four. We will update this as information becomes available.

So how about a nice touchscreen shopping mall kiosk that dumps the latest movies to a USB stick for a few cents each? For more than 30 years, consumers have obtained music and movies written to polycarbonate discs. CD, DVD and now Blu-ray discs are recognizable across the world as a cheap and pretty reliable carrier for large volumes of digital data. While it may take a while before Blu-ray takes its final breaths, CDs and DVDs are already on borrowed time. For the younger generation already accustomed to storing huge amounts of data on tiny MicroSD cards and USB sticks, a plastic disc carrying content is almost as outdated as a vinyl record. With this in mind, millions of consumers would welcome the idea of getting their movies in convenient formats such as AVI or MP4. This would enable them to freely move content from device to device, without having to spend more money. Of course, entertainment companies don’t like that idea at all, especially when it comes to movies. That’s where SwiftMedia comes in, and it’s a sight to behold. Spotted by a TorrentFreak reader in a shopping mall in Ethiopia, this bright yellow kiosk looks like an ATM. However, on closer inspection it reveals itself to be a self-service media machine that does everything that RedBox can do (and more) without a plastic disc in sight. A SwiftMedia terminal in situ (credit) “At the beginning of this year, All Mart (the Walmart equivalent here) brought in a new machine. It’s basically a monitor with a USB port but shaped like an ATM. It’s called SwiftMedia and there’s a guy who ‘maintains’ it,” our source explains. “Basically you go to this very big store and you approach the machine and you plug in a USB drive. The screen will turn on and it will let you browse through a massive archive of movies.” Screen close-up As mentioned earlier, this is a completely disc-less system, meaning that transfers of all content purchased from the machine end up on a customer-provided USB stick. Needless to say, DRM and copyright protection aren’t high on the agenda for this unusual and innovative machine. All the movies – on USB Prices are cheap too, with packages available for 25, 50 and 100 birr ($1, $2 and $3). Feature movies reportedly cost between 3 and 5 birr (13 to 22 cents) depending on the movie release date, with older movies costing more. Documentaries weigh in at the top of the range with single songs and TV shows costing 13 cents. “At first I assumed these movies had their rights lifted or something because well, you know, but then I later found out that the movies I had first seen were just there on release day,” our source continues. “Apparently the maintenance guy torrents all day and stores the data on his drive, the drive shown by the SwiftMedia monitor. This would not have been a big deal as this is Ethiopia and the allegedly democratic government has bigger issues.” Of course, something like this wouldn’t last five minutes in the West and certainly wouldn’t appear in a shopping mall, let alone Walmart. So TorrentFreak contacted Escape Computing, the company that appears to be behind the project, to find out more about their enterprise. At the time of publication we had received no response, but we did manage to track down a job listing posted last year where the company sought an individual to act in a sales and technical capacity. It’s not clear whether the position was filled but whoever got the job certainly has a unique role to fulfill in this unusual yet somewhat innovative project.

But there are ways to use the crisis as a way to speed long-overdue land use reforms.   Nolan Gray @mnolangray Apr 30, 2017 Comments Share on Facebook Tweet In January, Macy's announced the closing of 68 stores, part of a widespread decline in brick-and-mortar retail activity. (Mike Blake/Reuters) The proliferation of half-vacant shopping centers and abandoned malls on the fringes of cities has become such a pervasive problem that we have a new word for it: greyfields. Chances are you have a few in your community: acres of paved parking with weeds creeping through the cracks and a dilapidated big-box structure standing in the middle. They’re the increasingly hard-to-ignore manifestation of what’s often described as the retail meltdown. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the retail sector lost approximately 30,000 jobs in March alone, with thousands of store closings projected through 2017. At this pace, store closings in 2017 are likely to surpass the Great Recession year of 2008. The retail meltdown has claimed both mom-and-pop shops and once-mighty retail titans; Macy’s, J.C. Penney, and Sears are all in the process of closing hundreds of locations. As these big anchor stores lose their grip, so go the smaller ones. Without big names to bring in customers, mall and shopping center owners are finding their business model slipping away. The key distinction here is between online retail and brick and mortar retail. E-commerce is booming, with a startling 50 percent of American households having an Amazon Prime membership. It’s the stores you have to drive to that are in trouble, reflected in rising retail vacancy rates in many metro areas. Some may find pleasure in the aesthetics of dead-and-dying malls, but they pose big challenges for the communities around them: Besides functioning as ugly, life-sucking border vacuums, defunct shopping centers represent lost tax dollars for cash-strapped municipalities. Here are three ways that cities could fend off the retail meltdowns in their midst: Ease land-use restrictions In many cases, the greatest barrier to the redevelopment of these greyfields is self-imposed: The zoning simply won’t allow much beyond conventional big box retail. A quick survey of your typical zoning ordinance explains why. In many cases, you will find that arterial roads—those most likely to host greyfields—are zoned exclusively for suburban-style big box and strip-mall developments. These districts often require an ocean of parking and massive setbacks from the road while prohibiting common non-retail uses, including residential, light industrial, and occasionally even office space. The perverse result is that developers can’t turn these greyfields into the denser mixed-use developments that residents and city managers alike yearn for. Even without new development or rehabilitation, it is often difficult to repurpose old retail developments. If you are a local policymaker concerned about greyfields, ask yourself: Can an enterprising developer turn that empty big box into a co-working space? Can food trucks turn that parking lot into a lunchtime market? If you answered “no” to either question, it’s time for regulatory reform. Rethink economic incentives For decades, economic development often meant using tax incentives and public resources to lure in large national retail chains, whatever the cost. It isn’t hard to see why: From an economic perspective, retail has been one of the chief employers in many small communities. From a political perspective, bringing in a Wal-Mart or opening a new mall allowed for a ribbon-cutting ceremony and provided a clear signal to voters that jobs were on their way. But cities and towns gave out millions of dollars in tax breaks and free land, while building out roads and utilities on the edge of town. Given the massive amounts of public infrastructure needed for many of these developments, conventional suburban retail developments are often a drain on tax coffers in the long-term. Today’s Amazon distribution center could easily be tomorrow’s dead mall Contrary to what many city officials may think, the lesson of the retail meltdown is not that we should switch from subsidizing brick and mortar retail to subsidizing e-commerce with the same old mixture of property tax abatement and free infrastructure. Rather, the lesson is that cities should be very cautious about plowing public resources into attracting specific firms. Today’s Amazon distribution center could easily be tomorrow’s dead mall. Think corner stores, not big boxes For many city planners, the enormous size and stability of large-scale suburban retail developments were seen as strengths. After all, if everything goes according to plan, they make tax collection and regulatory enforcement easy. As the retail meltdown reveals, however, these developments are far more fragile than previously anticipated. In dynamic urban economies, smallness, accessibility, and a high-quality experience are more important. Unlike rows of interchangeable national chains on the edge of town, a more diverse ecosystem of small locally owned businesses can rapidly respond to consumer need while offering experiences that can’t be replicated through e-commerce. Policymakers should make life easier for entrepreneurs by keeping regulatory compliance as easy as possible. Related Stories How Economic Development Incentives Hurt Small Businesses A New Life for Dead Malls Shopping Malls Aren't Actually Dying They can also empower small developers by easing ’70s-era anti-urban use and density restrictions in and around downtowns, as cities like Buffalo and Baltimore are doing with their zoning updates. Clearing out stodgy old lists of permitted and prohibited uses and allowing for small-scale mixed-use development in urban residential areas—think corner delis and neighborhood shops—can provide space of viable local commercial activity, creating a stronger community in the long term. For cities that bought heavily into subsidizing large suburban shopping centers, this transformation of American retail will be painful. But the silver lining is that the meltdown might provide the impetus for city leaders to make desperately needed policy reforms. Keeping greyfields zoned for malls and strip developments isn’t helping anyone. Time has tested the subsidization of large retail developments in the name of economic development, and the results aren’t encouraging. More than ever, cities need to take the challenges that face small entrepreneurs and developers seriously. Easing the restrictions that city officials built around the status quo of suburban retail would be a great start. That half-vacant mall on the edge of town isn’t coming back. But if we get the policy right, it might be replaced by something far more valuable.

The current narrative surrounding retail is that it’s Armageddon -- stores are closing and whole chains are going out of business. Motley Fool Staff Apr 30, 2017 at 2:12PM In this segment of Industry Focus: Consumer Goods, Sarah Priestley is sitting in as host, and she's joined by Motley Fool contributor Daniel Kline to discuss the reality of what's actually happening in retail. The two talk about how perception is not always reality and note that although many retailers are struggling, chains such as Dollar General (NYSE:DG) are adding locations at a rapid pace. The two discuss the Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) effect and how it's driving some chains out of business while others are figuring out ways to thrive. In addition, they look at some data showing how overall physical retail sales have grown, at least in Q4, even though the perception may be that they have shrunk. A full transcript follows the video. This video was recorded on April 25, 2017. Sarah Priestley: Retail spending as a whole, according to the Census Bureau, is up 5% year over year, and up 17% in the last five years. But the conventional wisdom, as you described it in one of your recent articles, is that the retail industry is kind of dead, it's dying. And there's a lot of enthusiasm for that, and I'll play devil's advocate here for just a minute and go into that. On the surface, there's a lot of evidence that backs up that point. In the past year or two, we've had bankruptcies from [Payless ShoeSource], The Limited, Wet Seal, Gander Mountain, Sports Authority, and recently we're seeing a lot of news about store closures. Macy's is closing 100 stores, J.C. Penney over 100, [Sears Holdings] -- 78 Kmarts, 26 Sears locations, and they've even admitted substantial doubt in their ability to keep the doors open. Dan Kline: It's one of those things where what you see isn't what's actually happening. You walk around the mall -- we were talking about this upstairs -- the mall near me, the lower-grade mall, about a third of it has become the fake edifices where they put a vending machine and a "Coming Soon" sign, and there's nothing there, because a lot of stores have gone out. RadioShack is one you didn't mention; they've closed 1,000 or 1,100 on their way to complete oblivion, their second bankruptcy. You look and go, "Oh my God, mall retailers are closing." My Macy's closed; the Macy's I could walk to from my house literally closed. And it would seem like that makes sense. The narrative is, the internet is killing physical retailers. Priestley: Yeah. The Amazon effect, as people call it. Kline: And I believed it as well. And then I went to the Shoptalk conference. I mention this because this research came from a gentleman named Kasey Lobaugh from Deloitte. What he pointed out, and he only showed one quarter's worth of data, and the people who track retail data, National Retail Federation and others, they don't break out internet versus physical retailer sales. So this is a bit elusive. But what he said is, during the fourth quarter, the holiday season, the overall dollar growth of physical and online was about the same; it was $12 billion each. In terms of physical retail, which is much bigger, that turned a 2%-3% gain. On the online side, it was 13%-15% gain. But the reality is, what we're seeing is, failing stores are closing, and there are plenty of chains that are taking their places. If you look in the discount space, Dollar General is opening 1,000 stores this year, and they opened 1,000 last year. Even chains that have a perception of struggling, like Target, are opening and adding. Target is going into markets that Wal-Mart had decided to not go after, which is cities, and they're putting in 20,000- to 30,000-square-foot stores, about 20% the size of their regular stores. You're seeing fragmentation and a shift in retail. Today, there was a story that Warby Parker, the eyeglasses people who both of us would probably do well to visit, is opening more retail stores. So you're absolutely seeing the Amazon effect killing certain retailers, but it's also creating opportunity for other retailers. Priestley: Absolutely. I think the retailers that are being rewarded are the ones that are actually listening to their customer and understanding what their customers want. As you quite rightly pointed out, retail as a whole is growing. E-commerce is growing at a faster rate, but e-commerce as a whole is growing. I think Moody's estimates the discount environment to grow 7% this year. Obviously, people are still going to the stores. It's not like we're going to be telling our grandchildren what a shop was like and staying inside all the time. So why do you really think that some of these stores have it right, and what do you think investors should be listening out for? Kline: If you're Dollar General, you're competing on price, you're basically going in and saying, "Amazon might be as cheap or even cheaper, but I have it now." They have hit the sweet spot when it comes to pricing. But a lot of the chains that are working are ones that offer an experience. Best Buy has turned the corner, and part of the reason Best Buy succeeds when we just lost hhgregg is, when you walked into hhgregg, it was a very 1980s retail experience. There were refrigerators over there, there were stereos over here, there were computers. There was nothing joyous or interactive about the store. When you walk into a Best Buy now, you can go play with a Nintendo Switch, you can go sit in a chair and try out different audio systems. There's stores within a store, which is a concept J.C. Penney is using, too. We've talked, I have a background in retail, I ran a giant toy store for two years. If you give people a reason to come in, it could be as simple as there's a coffee shop in my bookstore and people want coffee, if they have to walk by all your merchandise on the way to the coffee or on the way to play the Nintendo Switch or on the way to get a haircut at J.C. Penney or take their picture at Sears or wherever it happens to be, that's a chance to capture them as a customer. So retailers have to think smarter. I think that's something that Macy's missed out on, and Sears really missed out on. You go to Sears now and they're struggling, and it's still hard to find the merchandise you want. They have not made them. And I buy clothes at Sears sometimes; they have not made the shopping experience easy. The alternative is, I can go to Amazon and say, "I want pants; I want this size and color," and in two days they show up, and if they don't fit, I'm supposed to return them but I don't, so Amazon just gets another pair of pants sales from me.

It isn’t a new video game console or some other high-tech gadget. It’s a low-tech, inexpensive device called a fidget spinner. Stores can’t keep it in stock, and teachers are banning it from classrooms because of the disruption. Fidget spinners are smaller than your palm, with two or three prongs with circles in them, along with a circular pad in the middle where you hold the device with your finger and thumb and spin it. USA Today reports that manufacturers say the gadgets aren’t just fun to play with, but also help people with ADHD, anxiety, autism and various other conditions. The demand for these devices is coming from children, college students and adults who are looking to help release nervous energy or stop fidgeting, reports the New York Post. The toys come in plastic, brass, steel or copper and retail for $5 to $7. Walmart, Toys ’R’ Us and other stores are having a hard time keeping the products in stock nationwide, according to media reports, and that seemed to be the case over the weekend after a search in half a dozen Olathe stores. The consensus is that Amazon.com is the best place to find them at the moment. College students are buying them ahead of finals, hoping they will help them focus. While they were designed to help people focus, relieve stress and stop fidgeting, the fidget spinners are now becoming a distraction in some classrooms because of their popularity, according to an ABC report. That, too, seems to be the case in Olathe, based on anecdotes from students. Do you or you children have yours yet?

While it’s easy to blame the internet for the struggles of some brick-and-mortar retailers, the story is not that simple. Motley Fool Staff Apr 30, 2017 at 10:10AM Some chains may be struggling at least in part because they built too many locations, as did many of their competitors. In some ways, that makes the current retail situation more of a correction than the wholesale shift in shopping that many think it is. In this segment of Industry Focus: Consumer Goods, Sarah Priestley is sitting in as host and is joined by Motley Fool contributor Daniel Kline to look at what's happening in retail. The two talk about store closures and why they're happening, as well as when they may stop. They also look at how malls are changing and what shopping centers will look like in the future. A full transcript follows the video. This video was recorded on April 25, 2017. Sarah Priestley: On that point about the physical stores and the size, I'm interested to get your opinion on whether all of this space is still going to be saved, because I have an interesting statistic. The U.S. has six times more square feet per capita retail space than the U.K. And obviously, so, that is the availability of space. But that's a huge amount of retail space. Can all of this be used? Dan Kline: No. It's too much. We talked a lot about this -- there's jokes on The Simpsons about the sad mall, but most communities have the sad mall, which maybe has the C-level Macy's (NYSE:M) or J.C. Penney as the anchor, and it's the only mall that has some local stores, and maybe one of those places that sells $49 suits. I think you're going to start to see -- and actually, we talked about this a little bit upstairs -- the new mall is going to push out the old mall. You're going to see closures. There's a demand for housing, so you're going to see a lot of conversions. We have too much retail space. There were a lot of articles this week about how difficult it's going to be to fill the 300-something hhgregg stores. There's only so many trampoline places that can go into a town, or movie theaters. And yeah, some malls can be anchored by grocery stores. But no, we have too much space, and there's going to be an absolute pullback in that area. Priestley: The concluding thoughts on that basis, then, is that some are going to lose, but generally, if you can target your customer, if you can meet your customer where they're at, you can still make the most of the space that you have. Kline: Yeah. I think you have to do what J.C. Penney is doing and look at your stores, and maybe get rid of some of them. Or change locations. Apple, near where my mom lives, in Salem, Mass., was in the mall. They've recently moved to an outdoor plaza, because they found that if you're going to get your iMac repaired, it's a giant pain to walk a 27-inch computer through the mall, drop it off, then come back and pick it up, whereas if they could locate in this lifestyle plaza, you can park right in front of the store, you can walk in, and it's a much easier shopping experience. So I think stores and retailers need to examine on a store-by-store, location-by-location basis, does this location make sense? Can I make better use of the space? Can I bring in vendors or partners? Are there services? If I'm a J.C. Penney, should I double down on salons, should I put in a massage studio; should there be yoga at Barnes & Noble (NYSE:BKS)? Who knows what else. I've joked for years that Barnes & Noble should put in music lessons because it would be a very logical tie-in to what they do, and they already sell all the books. You should be looking at diversification and capturing people and going beyond shopping. There's very little that you need that it isn't easier to get from [Amazon.com]. So if the experience isn't enjoyable, and there isn't a nice cup of coffee or a frozen yogurt or something that's part of the experience, then you aren't going to leave your house. Priestley: You said double down -- that was the phrase you used on the concept, and I think that's exactly right. The problem with department stores now is they're trying to be everything to everybody and have not really been successful anywhere. I think these companies need to know who their audience is, who their consumer is, and really facilitate what they want. Barnes & Noble yoga classes sounds ridiculous, but if Barnes & Noble's cafe has a lot of stay-at-home mothers and young students that might be interested in doing things like that, then it's a great idea. Kline: If you're Barnes & Noble, you're locked into leases, very long-term leases, in a lot of cases. And you used to stock music, DVDs. Priestley: Those things used to exist. [laughs]  Kline: You don't need those anymore. And while they've brought in games and some other sort of incidental retail, most Barnes & Noble locations have big, empty spaces. So what do you do with the space? You could make it a day care, you could make it a yoga studio, you could make it music -- you know, privacy places, whatever it is, figure out how to monetize that. Retailers use a formula where they look at, how many dollars is this square foot producing? If it's just picnic tables where people can read your magazines for free, it's not producing any dollars. There's a lot of low-impact ways -- bring in an outside vendor. What's compatible to book sales? Maybe women's shoes are up. Super logical. You find there's a correlation. Maybe it's pet supplies. I don't know what the answer is. But do those studies, and go to those vendors. If you go to Wal-Mart in certain markets, there's eyeglass places that are not Wal-Mart; there's Music and Arts, which is a chain of music retailers that specializes mostly in elementary-school kids and lessons. Find the things your customers want and bring them in. Even if it's just a breakeven, they're going to shop at you more. Costco worries about frequency of visits. The reason they essentially give away gas is because you're going to come to Costco more often, you're going to be more tied to them, you're going to renew your membership, maybe you'll buy more stuff. Every store needs to think that way.  Priestley: So, final thought, if I'm a Macy's or a [Sears Holdings] investor, what would you advise me to listen out to, and in the earnings call, what would you want to see from management? Kline: If you're a Sears investor, don't believe anything they're saying. It's a bit of a shell game. Vince and I have talked about this at least four or five times. If you have $2 billion in assets and $8 billion in debt, you might be able to use your assets for a certain amount of time to forestall your debt. But if you haven't fundamentally changed your business, which they have not, then you're in real trouble. Macy's is a different story. Macy's is a profitable company that's not as profitable, that's struggling. I would look at, are there really new ideas? Are they doing things differently? Are they making bold changes? I would like to see Macy's testing 10 concepts that seven of them sound crazy to see what they are. Maybe they're renting out birthday-party clowns in one store, and they are putting in upscale cafes, which I think some Macy's actually have. But find different things, try different things. Also realize that if you're Macy's, the negativity is partially because you are a publicly traded company, which is expected to grow, grow, grow. As a private company, which could happen, there has been some interest in buying them; they're a stable business that just needs to pivot. They're not a failing business the way Sears is.

One of its most successful is FlipaClip, which allows users to create animation videos based on their own drawings. Al Diaz The Miami Herald Technology April 30, 2017 10:00 AM You, too, can be an animator. Yes, there’s an app for that. By Nancy Dahlberg ndahlberg@miamiherald.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Startup Spotlight Company name: Visual Blasters (creators of FlipaClip) Headquarters: Downtown Miami Concept: Visual Blasters develops gaming, multimedia and animation mobile apps. “We provide high quality, intuitive apps with an eye toward making the world a better place by helping people express their creativity, discover music and have fun while doing it,” said CEO Jonathan Meson. Story: In 2010, brothers Jonathan Meson, 33, then a software engineer for Motorola, and Marcos Meson, 38, a senior motion graphics designer at HairDirect.com, founded Visual Blasters, with the mission of designing apps that create “communities” around people’s passions and creative pursuits such as music, animation and games. ​The brothers combined their programming and design skills to create their first product, “XiiaLive,” an internet radio app that offers an uninterrupted Internet radio experience. The app has been downloaded more than 5 million times and has about 100,000 active users. “Xiialive was a success, but was more a product of opportunity, not long-term strategic planning,” said Jonathan. That changed with its next release. Youngest brother Tim Meson, 26, a software engineer at Oracle, joined the startup to launch a free animation app for Android users in 2012 called FlipaClip. This flip-book style drawing and animation app for Android grew faster than anyone expected, quickly earning a 4.3/5.0 star rating, and over 4.5 million downloads. In less than a year, FlipaClip doubled monthly active users from 250,000 to more than 550,000. The app, now also available for iOS, allows people to make their own animations by drawing a series of pages through the app to achieve the motion. “People are using it on social media to express their artistic side,” Jonathan said. Here’s a tip: “You don’t have to be a really good artist. We give them all the basics they need to get started.” Jonathan Meson, who heads up the team behind Visual Blasters, at his downtown Miami office. The team’s app FlipaClip is a hit on Android devices and is now available on iOS. AL DIAZ adiaz@miamiherald.com The company’s competitive advantage is a combined laser-focus on ease of use and simplicity, a robust set of features, and a platform that ensures products scale effortlessly. The startup makes money through in-app purchases that unlock additional animation tools and ads within the app. Plans for FlipaClip include adding audio as an animation tool. A key milestone came in 2014, when Visual Blasters entered into a licensing agreement with Fuhu Holdings, a company that makes children’s tablets for Target and Walmart and was recently acquired by Mattel. The agreement resulted in more than 400,000 devices with FlipaClip tech pre-installed. FlipaClip has attracted all age groups, but the brothers are seeing lots of traction among the 13- to 18-year-olds. “They are spending hours animating instead of watching video games,” said Jonathan, who created stop-motion animation with Legos when he was a kid and made movies with his brothers. “A sense of creation was embedded in us and this app was born out of that.” In March, FlipaClip launched on iOS with the help of the Animate ‘Unravel’ Contest – a partnership with Miami-based indie band “Tell Her I Love Her” to promote its first single. The contest, underway through May 12, seeks animation entries inspired by the band’s “Unravel” song; entrants are vying for $2,000 in cash prizes. The FlipaClip team learned that the contest can be a powerful vehicle to introduce people to the FlipaClip app, earning some 72,000 views of more than 180 contestant animated videos so far.

Also in March, launched the Animate ‘Unravel’ Contest with Miami-based indie-band “Tell Her I Love Her” to announce iOS version of FlipaClip. FlipaClip AL DIAZ adiaz@miamiherald.com Biggest startup challenge: Working with a remote workforce and communicating with developers and customer service team members in different countries and time-zones. Next steps: “Our plan is to grow FlipaClip and slowly release new applications that fit within our product portfolio and that makes sense with our company focus,” Jonathon said. “New products experience greater growth when they have the power of an existing user base and known brand to leverage. ... In the coming years, we’re going to devote more attention to honing our marketing and brand message and activating our user community in ways that are both fulfilling to them and beneficial to us.” Follow @ndahlberg on Twitter Read more Startup Spotlights Miami startup reinvents shopping for emergency insurance Want the yachting life - even for a day?

Rumors continue to flow about the 13-year-old Pekin boy, who went missing Nov. 17, 2016. Robert, who has red hair, was last seen wearing a red and gray shirt, blue jeans and red Nike shoes. He was not carrying a cell phone, and had no money. No family or friends have since reported having any contact with the youth. His sister, Stephanie Clauser, said Robert takes medication for seizures and ADHD. He could have colored his hair and is wearing colored contacts. He was said to have been seen in Springfield. In an April 3 post to LinkedIn’s “Pulse,” Carri Williams, a self-proclaimed “Psychic Detective” from Woodstock, Ill. claims she dreamed someone named “Kevin” was involved in Robert’s disappearance and that she knows where he will be found by his father. No matter how far-fetched some ideas may seem, it’s clear most sources seem to have good intentions, and are holding out hope that Bee will return safe and sound. “We all want him found,” Susie Kemper posted recently on “The Official Finding Robert Bee Discussion” Facebook closed group page. “Right Susie. He’s like our adopted kid,” responded Jan Bridgmon. The page, launched in December 2016, has three administrators and hosts 3,126 members, most of whom seem to have little or no previous kinship with Robert or his family. Conversations and debate continue daily on the page, along with frequent unsubstantiated rumors and theories. Robert’s father, Robert J. Bee, died March 8, 2017 as a resident of Kindred Hospital. The 64-year-old was ill and living in an assisted living center well before his death. In what appears to be a March 29 post written by Robert’s mother, Lisa Bee wrote, “I got a update on my son today he was seen in Springfield getting out of a truck with two guys.” That post, however, cannot be found on any of Bee’s three Facebook profiles, and his sighting is unconfirmed. Of the tips from the public, none have had the teeth to warrant a payout of the $1,000 reward Peoria Crime Stoppers routinely offers for a solid lead in a case, according to Pekin Police Investigations Sgt. Seth Ranney. “It’s just one of those cases and people want answers and we want that worse than anything,” he said. “We follow tips until they’re exhausted. It takes a lot of man hours, but we have a duty to run those down.” One such tip was that of Jennifer Gordon, who, in January told state and local police in good detail that Robert was witnessed entering his house at 233 Sapp St., and that she and neighbors believed it must be searched. The house at 233 Sapp St. in Pekin remains vacant, at least since Feb. 27 when landowner Gregory Gianessi was granted a Judgment of Possession in Tazewell County. Lisa Bee and her son Robert Bee Jr. lived in the home at the time of his disappearance in November 2016. Bee vacated the house before the eviction, according to an eight-minute video she posted to Facebook two days before the judgment, claiming she was a resident in a drug rehabilitation home. (Photo by Holly Eitenmiller/for Chronicle Media) It was a lead Pekin Police chief John Dossey said was “deliberately false,” and Gordon admitted to that. A glut of responses quickly followed, with one person claiming a child’s body was also discovered in south Peoria. Ranney said no children’s bodies have been discovered in central Illinois since Robert was reported missing, and Peoria County Coroner Jamie Harwood confirmed none were found in Peoria. Still, public interest continues to thrive, and the case has been featured on national crime reporter Nancy Grace’s Facebook page and written about on Crimeonline.com. In the meantime, the State of Illinois Missing and Endangered Persons’ poster of Robert has begun to appear in public places, such as Walmart. There are no indications that the 4-foot-6, 110-pound boy was abducted, which is why an Amber Alert was never issued. Ranney would not confirm if the police have any suspects, and the Sapp Street house has been turned over to its owner, Gregory Gianessi. LIsa Bee was evicted from the home in March, though she had vacated the premises earlier, according to a Feb. 25 video in which she describes her life in a residential drug rehabilitation clinic. The video was self-produced and there is no confirmation that Bee had moved to a clinic. Nevertheless, the house is now vacant. “We have done searches,” Ranney said. “The house is released to him to clean up. You would have to have something major to hold it indefinitely.” The bicycle that, until recently, lay unmoved in the front yard there is gone, and his mother’s whereabouts remain largely unknown. Many of those following the case question Bee’s involvement in her son’s disappearance and are suspicious of her lack of enthusiasm in his search. On April 21, Bee launched a Facebook group titled, “Help me share nationwide to bring my son Robert Bonzai Bee home to his mom.” When questioned on a post there what Robert might do if he returned home to an empty house, she responded, “My number has changed he knows how to go to my old neighbor and get police department they have my new number got kicked out of house.” There have been no posts or comments in the group from his mother since April 21. It is not known if she is actually responsible for launching the group, or if it is yet another hoax. Bee failed to appear at a Jan. 3 truancy hearing at the Tazewell County Courthouse, and was found guilty in her absence. A total of $386 in unpaid truancy-related fines remain unpaid. Her reports that Robert stayed the night with friends Nov. 17, then walked to the bus stop the next morning are unconfirmed. CrimeStoppers is offering a $1,000 reward for information leading to Bee’s whereabouts, and will continue to accept anonymous tips. Anyone with information about Robert Bee is urged to call CrimeStoppers at 673-9000 or the Pekin Police Department at 346-3132.   Related stories:  Police, sister keep up search for missing Pekin boy Police looking for leads in search for missing Pekin boy   –Theories abound but no real leads on missing Pekin boy — Tagged with: chronicle media Chronicleillinois.com chroniclemedia.com Illinois State Police Missing boy missing teen Pekin Peoria Crime Stoppers peoriacountychronicle.com police Tazewell County Chronicle tazewellchronicle.com woodfordchronicle.com Ad 1 – 300×250 – Google ROS Ad 2 – 300×250 – Medianet ROS Ad 3 – 300×600 – Post Pages – Google ROS Contact Us Advertise with Us Find a Copy Legal Notices Privacy Policy Copyright © Chronicle Media, LLC.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 30 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman 7 Lessons from Warren Buffett’s Mistakes That Will Make You a Better Investor Warren Buffett didn’t amass his huge fortune by making a lot of mistakes. But he readily admits to making some over the years. Failure can be a great teacher. Just as we can (and should) learn from our own mistakes, we can also learn from the mistakes of others. Here are seven lessons from the Oracle of Omaha’s blunders that will help you become a better investor. Image source: The Motley Fool. 1. Don’t make a decision too quickly In his 2013 letter to Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK-A) (NYSE: BRK-B) shareholders, Buffett told the story of the time he bought $2 billion of debt of Energy Future Holdings. The company was formed in 2007 with the goal of finalizing a huge leveraged buyout of electric utility assets in Texas. Buffett’s biggest regret about the deal was that he made it without consulting his longtime partner, Charlie Munger. Few people are fortunate enough to have someone like Charlie Munger to go to for counsel. But we can all strive to avoid what Warren Buffett did: He made the decision too quickly. It’s better to add a little distance before finalizing your decision on an investment — even if it’s much smaller than Buffett’s $2 billion mistake. 2. Fully evaluate the company and the industry Buffett wrote to Berkshire shareholders in 2015 about his track record with the company’s manufacturing, service and retailing operations. Most made solid returns, but not all of them. In most of the cases where business weren’t performing as well, he admitted to being wrong in his evaluation of the business or the industry in which it operates. Perhaps the biggest example of Warren Buffett being wrong in his assessment of an industry was with Berkshire Hathaway itself. He had the opportunity to sell his stock of what was then a textile manufacturer and make a nice profit. But instead, Buffett kept on investing more into what he later confessed was a dying business. In 1985, Berkshire’s textile operations were finally shut down. No one will get it right all the time, of course. But make sure you don’t have blinders on when it comes to buying a stock. Research not only the company but the industry as well. 3. Check out the competition On a somewhat related note, Buffett noted in his 2014 shareholder letter that one of his „most gruesome” mistakes was not checking out the competition for Dexter Shoes before buying. When he bought the company in 1993, everything looked great. What Buffett didn’t realize at the time, though, was that foreign competition was about to rear its head. The initial $443 million investment on Dexter Shoes fell to zero. Regardless of what stock you’re buying, what industry it’s in, or the size of the investment, check out the competition. The landscape is littered with companies that used to be solid but ultimately couldn’t compete against better, faster, and/or cheaper rivals. 4. Don’t invest with money better deployed elsewhere To make matters worse with the Dexter Shoe deal, Warren Buffett used Berkshire Hathaway stock to fund the transaction. The shares that he gave in exchange for Dexter would have been worth $5.7 billion when Buffett wrote the 2014 letter. (Berkshire’s stock has gone up more than 40% since the beginning of 2014, so the snafu looks even more disastrous now.) There’s an important lesson for average investors: Don’t invest money in a stock that is better deployed elsewhere. Sometimes the worst thing in the world you can do is to sell a winning stock to buy shares of a company that you think might perform well. If a stock is making solid returns and its business fundamentals are solid, hold on to it. 5. Don’t second-guess yourself too much Berkshire Hathaway bought General Reinsurance Corporation in 1998. Shortly thereafter, Warren Buffett began to doubting his decision. There were problems that caused outside observers to think that the billionaire had blundered big-time. But Buffett’s mistake wasn’t in buying General Re; His mistake was in second-guessing himself. General Re turned out to be, in Buffett’s words, „a gem.” Luckily, he didn’t sell the company before re-evaluating. Perhaps the best lesson to learn from this is to not second-guess your decisions too much. Give some time for the stocks you’ve picked to either pan out — or not. Image source: Getty Images. 6. Never dawdle when it’s time to sell Contrary to what some might believe, Warren Buffett isn’t a buy-and-hold-forever kind of guy. He sells stocks routinely. In 2013, Tesco was listed among Berkshire Hathaway’s largest holdings. A year later, the food retailer wasn’t on the list at all. Buffett confessed to making a mistake with Tesco by „dawdling” when he should have sold earlier. (Charlie Munger, by the way, refers to waiting too long to sell as „thumb-sucking.”) Tesco had management problems and accounting problems that seemed to worsen every month. Buffett’s quote about this situation is classic: „In the world of business, bad news often surfaces serially: You see a cockroach in your kitchen; as the days go by, you meet his relatives.” What’s the moral of the story? When it’s time to sell, sell. 7. Don’t procrastinate Speaking of dawdling, Warren Buffett’s biggest mistakes of all were procrastination of a different kind. In 2014, he told shareholders that almost all of his most colossal errors were in not buying a stock when he should have. Buffett specifically referenced his regret in not buying Walmart (NYSE: WMT) stock years earlier. He even mentioned the giant retailer in his 1990 letter to shareholders, referring admiringly to how Walmart’s low operating costs allowed it to sell at prices that competitors couldn’t match and therefore constantly increase market share. But Buffett didn’t buy Walmart stock until 2005. Berkshire has since sold off most of its shares in the retailer. This mistake is probably the biggest mistake made by every investor. Don’t dawdle or thumb-suck when it’s time to buy a stock. Warren Buffett estimates that Berkshire’s value would be worth at least $50 billion higher if it had seized opportunities earlier on. It’s probably not nearly that amount, but you could be leaving money on the table, too, by not buying stocks when you should. 10 stocks we like better than Berkshire Hathaway (A shares) When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Idaho Business Health Nation World Elections Photos Business Motley Fool: Starbucks stock poised to perk up Sun., April 30, 2017, 4:02 a.m. Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz speaks at the Starbucks annual shareholders meeting March 22 in Seattle. The coffee company’s stock has been a dud for investors over the past year. (Elaine Thompson / Associated Press) Motley Fool Twitter Facebook  Email  Reddit  SMS Starbucks’ (Nasdaq: SBUX) stock has been a dud for investors over the past year. That has some wanting to exit the coffeehouse, but they will likely do well to stick around. In fiscal year 2016, sales at stores open longer than a year grew by 5 percent year over year, while the company opened more than 2,000 new stores worldwide, boosting overall revenue by 11 percent. Earnings per share grew by 17 percent, thanks to rising operating profit margins. While Starbucks already has more than 12,000 stores in the U.S., it’s still opening hundreds of new stores each year. The opportunity is even bigger in international markets, especially China. Its profitability and return on investment for new stores there is in line with its domestic performance. Now it just has to scale up. Meanwhile, Starbucks is steadily gaining market share in the packaged coffee market, and the launch of Teavana ready-to-drink tea in the U.S. earlier this year could drive an uptick in this segment’s growth. Other promising initiatives include mobile ordering, super-premium coffee and expanded food offerings. Given Starbucks’ reasonable valuation and its solid growth prospects, not to mention a growing dividend that recently yielded 1.6 percent, the stock is poised to deliver healthy long-term returns for shareholders who stick around. (The Motley Fool owns shares of and has recommended Starbucks.) Ask the Fool Q: When one company buys another, where does that money actually go? – P.S., Dalton, Georgia A: If the acquirer pays cash, the money goes to the shareholders of the acquired company. There might also be payments to other owner classes, such as holders of preferred stock. Some of the cash tendered will occasionally go to debt holders, if part of the purchase price is allocated to buying back debt. If the acquirer pays with its own stock instead of cash, then shareholders of the acquired company will get shares of the acquiring company in exchange for their shares of the acquired company. They can sell these shares for cash or simply hold on. Companies typically buy other companies for more than their prepurchase market price, paying a “premium.” Some purchases involve combinations of cash and stock. Q: What does a company’s “market cap” refer to? – H.B., Rochester, Minnesota A: A company’s market capitalization reflects the value the stock market is placing on it right now. To get it, you multiply the total number of shares outstanding by the stock price. For example, multiplying Apple’s 5.25 billion shares times its recent stock price of about $141 yields a market cap of $740 billion. That number can give you a sense of whether the company is overvalued or undervalued, if you compare it to past levels or to peers. That $740 billion is the biggest among all companies in the world, towering over Google parent Alphabet (recently at $581 billion), Microsoft ($502 billion), Amazon.com ($423 billion), Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway ($403 billion) and Facebook ($403 billion). Other big values include ExxonMobil ($339 billion), AT&T ($247 billion), Wal-Mart ($222 billion), Coca-Cola ($187 billion) and Disney ($179 billion). My dumbest investment My dumbest investment was buying $25,000 worth of General Electric stock instead of stock in Netflix. – P.P., online The Fool responds: You can never know just how a stock will perform. Depending on when you bought into GE, you may still have done well – shares rose about 13 percent annually, on average, over the past five years, but only about 2 percent over the past 10. Netflix, of course, averaged annual growth of about 45 percent or more over those periods. But Netflix’s growth was never a sure thing, and it still faces competition. It only introduced streaming video in 2007. Opinions have always been divided on whether Netflix’s stock is undervalued or overvalued. In the past, some lamented that it wasn’t moving into video game rentals, like Blockbuster was doing. When it tried to spin off its DVD business as “Qwikster” in 2011, the stock tanked, dropping 77 percent between mid-July and the end of the year. (Recently, of course, it was above $140.) Meanwhile, General Electric has a lot going for it as it sheds its less profitable businesses and focuses on becoming a digital industrial powerhouse, with more revenue coming from high-margin services. GE’s dividend has grown by 26 percent over four years, too, and recently yielded 3.2 percent. Netflix pays no dividend. Spread your money across your most promising ideas and expect some to do well and some not as well.

Despite coming up short, people persevered because the company that owns Dad's brand kept insisting that its elusive chocolate chip cookies were still available. Turns out, that was a mistake. Mondelez International is still selling other Dad's cookies including oatmeal and oatmeal chocolate chip. (Mondelez International) U.S.-based Mondelez International told CBC News that it stopped making Dad's chocolate chip cookies late last year and that the product dwindled from stores shelves over the following few months.   Other varieties, including the oatmeal chocolate chip version, are still available in Canada — the only country where the Dad's brand is sold. Mondelez says it dropped the plain chocolate chip cookie due to poor sales. "Nobody wants to see a brand go, but sometimes we have to make decisions," says Stephanie Cass, corporate affairs spokeswoman for Mondelez Canada. It's not where you say it is The news didn't go over well with Susan Armstrong from Langley, B.C. who was a huge fan of the Dad's chocolate chip version. "I think it's the shortbreadish taste. They were a good tasting cookie." Following her own unsuccessful quest for the cookie, Armstrong contacted Mondelez earlier this week on Facebook, looking for answers. On Tuesday, the company messaged her back, insisting the cookies were still available and even offered her a list of stores in her area carrying the product. Armstrong had just searched one of the stores — Save on Foods — to no avail. So she called the supermarket's head office and discovered that Mondelez had discontinued the cookie. "I was so angry with them," says Armstrong. "Why wouldn't you just say to the consumer, right off the bat, 'This particular brand of cookie, we're not selling anymore,' instead of prolonging this nonsense about, 'OK, well, you can get the cookie but you just can't find it.'" Susan Armstrong from Langley, B.C., is angry she was sent on a futile search for Dad's chocolate chip cookies. (Susan Armstrong) Other customers have also expressed frustration with similar messaging from Mondelez which told people the cookies were still available and to use the company's online locator to find a store carrying them in their area. "The product locator is not accurate," posted Ariana Boire on Facebook earlier this month. "It says the chocolate chip cookies are sold at Walmart and Save on Foods and I've been to both and neither sell it. Where are my favourite cookies!!" Hershey rejects takeover offer from Oreo maker Mondelez Mondelez spokesperson Cass told CBC News that its customer relations team had mistakenly misled people because it didn't have full information about the discontinuation. She offered an apology to customers for any inconvenience. "Since this was brought to our attention, we have been working to get information updated as quickly as possible," said Cass. The whole ordeal has left a bad taste in Armstrong's mouth. "That's a pretty lame excuse," she claims about customer service not knowing about the fate of Dad's chocolate chip cookies. Dad's has deep roots The Dad's brand dates back to 1929 when the Sturges family in Los Angeles came up with a winning formula for an oatmeal cookie. It took off in both Canada and the U.S. The U.S. franchises eventually went out of business and, in 1972, the three Canadian franchises joined forces to create the Dad's Cookie Company. It introduced the chocolate chip version in the early 1980s. In 1986, Dad's became part of U.S.-based Nabisco. In 2012, Mondelez — one of the world's largest snacks companies — took control of the Dad's brand. Cass says the company hopes that customers mourning the loss of their favourite Dad's cookie will check out the brand's other offerings. "We're actually hoping that the diehard Dad's chocolate chip fans will try oatmeal chip and see if they can get their chocolate chip in a different way." I only want chocolate chip Armstrong says her heart remains with the plain chocolate chip version. Sara Ortega agrees. She liked its homemade taste and how it softened when dipped in milk. "I've had them since I was little, so I just really like them." A couple months ago Ortega also launched a search for the cookie. It involved soliciting her dad and friends for help and even looking outside Vancouver. "I had a craving for them one day and I went on this whole investigation thing," she says. "I'm like, 'Why aren't they there?'" Sara Ortega in Vancouver used to love dipping Dad's chocolate chip cookies in milk. Now she has to make do with a different brand. (Sara Ortega) Of course, Ortega never found her cookies and, now that she knows they've been discontinued, she's trying to come to terms with it. "I've just been living without it and trying to forget about it. But it keeps popping up." Both Ortega and Armstrong say their last hope is to find the Dad's chocolate chip version in the United States. But according to Mondelez, the cookie has never been sold in the U.S. and, of course, there's no hope now of it ever showing up there.

SHARE You Said It, April 30, 2017 By Staff Saturday, April 29, 2017 The recent article regarding body cams was excellent! It’s concerning, however, that one of Colorado’s poorest counties (Delta) has body cams but other area police and sheriff’s departments (who could afford it if budgets were moved around) couldn’t afford it. These gizmos are very important and much needed. Protect our officers, deputies and citizens. In regards to the Orchard Mesa family pet murders. I can’t believe someone would do such a horrific act. It’s barbaric. The Sheriff’s Office should seriously investigate this, because whoever did this has serious violent tendencies. The chance they are violent with humans as well is a high probability. My heartfelt sympathies to the owner of those two beautiful dogs. So sad.   As a health care provider I am sworn to help the poor, the sick and the needy, but I also know that the two people who brutalized and eventually killed young Bethannie got off lightly. Plea deals for 48 years each, really? These animals needed to be penned up for much longer than that. Once again our “system” has failed a young child. When will they learn that the placement of a child with family is not always the best idea, especially when that family member is living with a non-family member? Our “system” should be ashamed of itself.   It was a good job, Judge Flynn, to give the women who killed little Bethannie 48 years. But it should be life without parole.   As new members of the community we attended the Grand Junction symphony concert on April 23 and were quite impressed with the performance. The Avalon Theatre is a gem for the community, and the symphony a valuable asset.   I am shocked that the city approved the proposed subdivision in the Redlands. The city should buy this as open space for the community as it is frequently utilized and a home for wildlife. As a resident of the Redlands near the proposed subdivision. I live there because it is quiet and I can walk the hills. I do not want to hear trucks and hammering for the next few years, nor do I want to live in “suburbia,” looking at the back of people’s houses. The land is not fit for houses as it floods and the ground is not stable.   Dear City Council, when city planners want a seven-year warranty, an engineer with the Colorado Geographical Survey says a 10-year warranty and you say you “wish you had more evidence of the soil condition at the site” for road construction, the logical thing to do is ask for more testing of the soil at the proposed site, not just give in to the developer. Have you driven down Mariposa lately and seen the “fix” of the road there, or around Redlands Mesa Golf Course to see the cracked, raised sidewalks? My car stalled on 26 and G roads. One young lady pulled over and pushed it out of the way for me. Another young lady asked if she could help, one asked if she could call AAA. I would like to thank them for their help. Also while waiting for AAA, several people asked if I was OK. Thanks to them, my car and I are fine.   How can you better yourself in this world when all you do is sit in the park all day or stand on the street corner with a sign and expect everyone else to help you? Maybe this is the reason the people who are working two jobs and are not asking for handouts resent being put in the same category as you no-doers.   I want to commend the city crews and planners for their outstanding work during the annual Spring Cleanup. Watching their quick, synchronized efforts reminded us of choreography. The workers staffing the trucks, front-loaders and street sweepers were incredibly efficient in ridding our neighborhood (and so many others) of yard waste and refuse of every description. Simply terrific work. Thanks to all for making this happen.   Thank you to City Market on 24 Road for removing those two signs at the entrance of their store. I think we often dwell on the negative and forget to thank those that do the right thing. I can now shop there without worries that the sign might again be blown down on someone. You are a great store and I appreciate you removing the signs.   On Easter Eve, my granddaughter was at Walmart shopping for stuff to make her two little girls Easter baskets. Her card was declined and the manager was trying to figure out why because the money was there. Meanwhile there was a lady waiting right behind her to check out and she offered to pay for all the things she was purchasing. My granddaughter told her that was very nice of her but she didn’t have to do that. This sweet angel insisted and said she has always wanted to do this for someone. Thank you, you sweet angel, for helping my granddaughter out. It will be passed on by more than one person.   One of the rewards of living in the Grand Valley is listening to 106.1 FM KRZX. I tried to turn it off all day today to watch the news channels but it wouldn’t let me loose. Thanks for today and so many before this one.   People in this town seem to think when they merge into traffic, they have the right of way. No, you are supposed to yield and wait for an opening. I had a lot of close calls. Slammed on brakes and honked the horn. And they give me the dirty look and the finger like it was my fault.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 30 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Alabama’s McCombs Vaults to Lead on Day Three of FLW Tour at Beaver Lake presented by General Tire Six-Year Tour Veteran Seeks First Career Win, Brings 2-pound, 5-ounce Lead into Final Day /EIN News/ — ROGERS, Ark., April 29, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — The weather was the big story Saturday at the FLW Tour event at Beaver Lake presented by General Tire. After a rainy week that had seen water levels rise more than 8 feet, Mother Nature continued to challenge the FLW Tour pros with another round of heavy storms and flash flooding that forced many of the final 20 Tour pros to seek shelter during the competition day.   After starting the day in 11th place, pro Johnny McCombs of Morris, Alabama, battled through the storms and brought a five-bass limit to the scale weighing 18 pounds, 15 ounces – the heaviest limit of the tournament and seventh largest at Beaver Lake in FLW Tour history – to vault to the top of the leaderboard. The four-day competition, hosted by Visit Rogers, featured a field of 161 of the world’s best bass-fishing professionals casting for a top award of up to $125,000. “I think the weather affected the fishermen more than the fish,” said McCombs, a three-time Forrest Wood Cup qualifier. “I fished all new water today and had my weight by 8:30 a.m. It wasn’t one spot – it was one here, one there. I caught them all on one bait.” With one day of competition remaining, McCombs was not yet ready to divulge the specifics of his bait. “The water is flooded into the bushes, and I’m just fishing down the bank line,” McCombs said. “I’m on a pattern and I know what to look for. If I pull into a place and it doesn’t look right, I’m out of there and on to the next one. “I actually stopped fishing a few hours early today because of the storms,” McCombs continued. “I’m excited to get back out there tomorrow and hopefully I can get the right bites that I need to win this thing.” The top 10 advancing to the final day of competition Sunday on Beaver Lake are:               1st:          Johnny McCombs, Morris, Ala., 15 bass, 41-13               2nd:         Jason Reyes, Huffman, Texas, 15 bass, 39-8               3rd:         Cody Meyer, Auburn, Calif., 15 bass, 35-6               4th:         Mud Hole Custom Tackle pro John Cox, DeBary, Fla., 14 bass, 35-3               5th:         Brandon McMillan, Clewiston, Fla., 15 bass, 34-5               6th:         Quaker State pro Scott Canterbury, Odenville, Ala., 15 bass, 33-4               7th:         Bryan Thrift, Shelby, N.C., 15 bass, 33-2               8th:         Keith Bryan, Novato, Calif., 15 bass, 32-6               9th:         Dean Alexander, Georgetown, Texas, 15 bass, 32-1               10th:       Christopher Brasher, Longview, Texas, 15 bass, 32-0 Finishing in 11th through 20th are:               11th:       Randy Blaukat, Joplin, Mo., 14 bass, 30-8, $12,000               12th:       Drew Montgomery, Maiden, N.C., 15 bass, 30-8, $12,000               13th:       Joseph Webster, Fulton, Miss., 15 bass, 30-6, $12,000               14th:       Bradley Dortch, Atmore, Ala., 15 bass, 29-8, $12,000               15th:       Nick Gainey, Charleston, S.C., 13 bass, 29-6, $12,000               16th:       Daniel Kweekul, Bryant, Ark., 12 bass, 29-2, $12,000               17th:       Tim Frederick, Leesburg, Fla., 13 bass, 28-12, $12,000               18th:       Matt Stefan, Junction City, Wis., 14 bass, 28-11, $12,000               19th:       Scott Ashmore, Broken Arrow, Okla., 11 bass, 28-3, $12,000               20th:       Jeff Dobson, Bartlesville, Okla., 15 bass, 26-15, $12,000 For a full list of results visit FLWFishing.com. Overall there were 90 bass weighing 172 pounds even caught by pros Saturday. Fourteen of the final 20 pros weighed in five-bass limits. Charley Slaton of Valliant, Oklahoma, won the co-angler division and $20,000 Friday with a two-day total of nine bass weighing 17 pounds, 15 ounces, followed by Billy Messer of Spartanburg, South Carolina, who finished in second place with 10 bass weighing 17 pounds, 14 ounces, worth $7,550. In FLW Tour competition, pros and co-anglers are randomly paired each day, with pros supplying the boat, controlling boat movement and competing against other pros. Co-anglers fish from the back deck against other co-anglers. The full field of 322 anglers competed Thursday and Friday. Co-angler competition concluded following Friday’s weigh-in, while the top 20 pros based on their two-day accumulated weight advance to Saturday. Only the top 10 pros continue competition Sunday, with the winner determined by the heaviest accumulated weight from the four days of competition. Throughout the season, anglers are also vying for valuable points in hopes of qualifying for the 2017 Forrest Wood Cup, the world championship of professional bass fishing. The 2017 Forrest Wood Cup will be on Lake Murray in Columbia, South Carolina, Aug. 11-13. The final 10 anglers will take off from the Prairie Creek Park Boat Ramp located at 9300 N. Park Road in Rogers at 6:30 a.m. Sunday. Sunday’s final weigh-in, originally scheduled to be held at Walmart in Rogers, has been moved lakeside to Prairie Creek Park due to inclement weather being forecast for the weekend. The final weigh-in will begin at 4 p.m. Prior to the weigh-in Sunday, FLW will host a free Fishing Expo at Prairie Creek Park from noon to 4 p.m. The Expo is a chance for fishing fans to meet their favorite anglers, enjoy interactive games, activities and giveaways provided by FLW sponsors, and learn more about the sport of fishing and other outdoor activities.

Police in Tennessee say they are asking a grand jury to bring charges because investigators believe bounty hunters shot two men in a wild incident last weekend in which one of the men was fatally wounded. Clarksville Police spokesman Jim Knoll said authorities will ask a county grand jury Monday to bring charges after the shooting last weekend in which he says neither man shot was the person whom bounty hunters were trying to serve with a warrant Authorities have declined to divulge many details about the shooting before the case heads to the grand jury. The man who died has been identified as 24-year-old Jalen Johnson, a father of three from Clarksville. His uncle said the victim was an innocent man gunned down in a case of mistaken identity. “Absolutely, they were out of control,” Johnson’s uncle, Toni Jenkins, said of the bounty hunters. “The objective of a bounty hunter is to identify a suspect and serve them with a warrant and bring them to jail, but that’s not what happened.” Knoll said the bounty hunters confronted four men in a car parked at a Wal-Mart Neighborhood Market in Clarksville just after midnight April 23. Shots were fired, and bounty hunters then chased the men for nearly seven miles, according to Knoll. He added that no one in the car had any outstanding warrant. The police spokesman wouldn’t say how many bounty hunters were involved, when the shots were fired and what exactly transpired in the parking lot. It’s not clear why the bounty hunters confronted the men in the vehicle. Other stories of interest Staff Sgt. Thomas L.

Travis Pope03/30/2017 The gaming community may have collectively known that the Destiny 2 release was on its way, but that doesn’t mean that knowledge stripped away the excitement. Bungie and Activision recently released the first trailer and kicked off the run-up to the Destiny 2 release with Destiny 2 pre-orders. At this moment you can purchase a physical or digital copy of the title that will almost certainly end up on lists of must-buy games by the year’s end. Destiny 2 is the follow-up to the much-loved and highly anticipated Destiny online role-playing game that made its debut back in 2014. The first game went on to sell millions of copies and still tops activity charts on Xbox Live and PlayStation Network. Destiny 2 pre-orders have arrived ahead of the game’s 2017 launch. Destiny 2 pre-orders are important because lead developer Bungie and publisher Activision are requiring them to get an early look at the game. Additionally, there are figurines and trinkets that’ll go on sale when the game does. Either gamer lovers place Destiny 2 pre-orders now or risk missing out on the cool things that these enhanced versions offer. Read: Destiny 2 Release Date, Features & Details Here are the details you need to navigate the maze that is Destiny 2 pre-orders. Destiny 2 Release Date & Platforms The Different Editions of Destiny 2 Destiny 2 Pre-Order Extras Destiny 2 Beta Early Access Destiny 2 Exclusive Content How You Can Save on Destiny 2 Now Destiny 2 Pre-Orders: Release Date & Platforms Destiny 2 pre-orders launched on March 30th, and they will be available until the night the game launches. It turns out that a leaked poster from GameStop Italy did have launch details correct. The Destiny 2 release date is Friday, September 8th, 2017 worldwide. New video games usually arrive on Tuesday in North America and Friday internationally. That’s not the case with Destiny 2. Everyone will get the online role-playing game at the same time. And by everyone, Activision and Bungie mean everyone. The two shocked people when they revealed they would need an Xbox One, Xbox 360, PS4 or PS3 to enjoy the original title. It never came to PC. Destiny 2 is coming to PCs running Windows, addressing complaints and opening up the franchise to another huge community. There’s also some bad news, though. The Xbox 360 and PS3 won’t get versions of the game at all. Instead, gamers will need to upgrade to the Xbox One and PS4 for access. It’s not a shocking development, many other developers and publishers have moved on too. Destiny 2 Pre-Orders: The Different Editions A sequel as anticipated as Destiny 2 is bound to have lots of options. Budget-minded gamers are going to go for the cheapest edition they can, but anyone that enjoyed the first title will find themselves tempted by the extensive list of Destiny 2 pre-orders options available. Destiny 2 Standard Edition Destiny 2 Standard Edition gets users just a copy of the game, whether it be in disc or digital form. Like all standard games, it costs $59.99. It’s available at GameStop and Best Buy. Destiny 2 Digital Deluxe Edition The Destiny 2 digital Deluxe edition gets gamers access to both of the expansion packs that’ll launch for the game after release. Bungie is promising “new story missions, cooperative activities, competitive multiplayer, and a wealth of new weapons, armor and gear.” Buyers of this version get three extras besides the game and pass, a Legendary Sword, Legendary Player Emote and the Cabal Themed Emblem. Destiny 2 Digital Deluxe is only available for Xbox One and PS4. It costs $99.99. It’s available in the Xbox Store and PlayStation Store. Destiny 2 Limited Edition Destiny 2 Limited Edition comes with the base game, pass, Legendary Sword, Legendary Player Emote and Cabal Empire Themed Emblem. A booklet with Cabal Empire secrets, a Cabal Schematic, Postcard images and Cabal Military Pawns are included. The game comes inside a Steelbook case. Of all the retailers offering Destiny 2 pre-orders, only GameStop will sell this version. PC, Xbox One and PS4 gamers can buy this for $99.99 today. Destiny 2 Collector’s Edition Destiny 2 Collectors Edition is the reason placing Destiny 2 pre-orders is a very good idea. It offers a ton of things. There are Xbox One, PS4 and Windows PC versions. Gamers get everything from the other versions. That includes the Limited Edition Steelbook case with schematic, booklet of secrets, and postcard images. The base game and expansion pass are included too. What other users don’t get is a customizable laptop bag that’s capable of holding a 15-inch device. They also don’t get the USB charger with built-in light, paracord or solar blanket. All of this doesn’t come cheap. Amazon, Best Buy, GameStop, Target and Toys R Us and Wal-Mart have pre-orders for $249.99. Destiny 2 Game + Expansion Xbox Store, GameStop and the PlayStation Store all have Destiny 2 + Expansion Pass. Best Buy and Amazon will too. However, their pre-order pages aren’t ready yet. This version costs $89.99. Destiny 2 Pre-Orders: Pre-Order Extras So far, a single retailer has stepped forward to announce exclusive extras that come with Destiny 2 pre-orders. That retailer is GameStop. It’ll give away a miniature Cade 6 figure to those that pre-order the game while supplies last. Cade-6 is featured heavily in the game’s trailers. As we get closer to launch, more add-on content for those that buy from a specific retailer could turn up. Destiny 2 Pre-Orders: Beta Early Access Being a heavily connected game, everyone assumed that there’d be a Destiny 2 Beta. There is a Destiny 2 Beta. Gamers will need to have placed Destiny 2 pre-orders to take advantage of it as soon as it is available. Those that pre-ordered the game will get access before anyone else, but Bungie also says that it will roll out an open beta after buyers have had access. Destiny 2 PS4 Exclusive Content Bungie is promising a story-driven narrative and a lot more with Destiny 2. One thing that’s staying the same is the game’s commitment to PS4. Gamers will get access to content on the PS4 version of the game first, a trailer posted to the PlayStation Blog reveals. More details about this content will be revealed over the summer, but Xbox owners won’t get their hands on this stuff until the fall of 2018 at the earliest. Destiny 2 Pre-Orders: How You Can Save Now Those that place their Destiny 2 pre-orders on their Amazon Prime account save 20%. You can save on Destiny 2 pre-orders today, provided you’re a member of Best Buy Gamers Club Unlocked or Amazon Prime. Both companies are offering 20% off the cost of any version of the game. That’s everything that we know about Destiny 2 pre-orders now. Bungie and Activision plan to show off gameplay on May 18th. That’s just before the Electronic Entertainment Expo gaming showcase in June. Activision typically makes big announcements about its yearly gaming line-up around the same time as the show is happening in Los Angeles, California. 7 Best Free Xbox Games Warframe   1 / 7  Many free-to-play games revolve around strategy or civilization building.

On Saturday, Myint and 40 other immigrants officially became U.S. citizens. For nearly 20 years, Myint dreamed of becoming an American. After civil war broke out in Myanmar, Myint and her family fled to Thailand. They lived for years cramped in a small, bamboo hut at a refugee camp.  Life inside the camp was a nightmare, she said. There wasn't enough food, there was no work, and minimal opportunities for education. People in the camp were not allowed to leave, either. She remembers her father sneaking out to forage bamboo and anything edible to feed the family. Sometimes, he was able to get away with working in a nearby village, but there were limited opportunities and minimal wages. "They can pay you whatever they want because they know you're from the refugee camp," she said. "So you work very hard all day and get hardly any money." Her father left to find work in Bangkok, and during that time, Myint's mother began the process of applying to come to America. The family at one time decided to cancel the application, but then reapplied.  When the application was approved, Myint had just turned 18 and her mother encouraged her to move to America, promising to follow soon.  Myint arrived in Pittsburgh in 2008. Not only was she living on her own for the first time and adjusting to a completely new culture, but she didn't speak English either. "It was so hard for me," she said. "At the camps, they don't really teach you any English." She watched lessons online and with the encouragement of her boss, worked toward her GED.  She moved to Virginia, where her mother and siblings joined her in 2013. They later moved to Lincoln to reunite with a friend. Her father was unable to immigrate with the family because he was not in the camp when they applied. It is unlikely that he'll be able to join the family because he's moved back to Myanmar. Myint said he would need to be living in a refugee camp to apply and then would have to wait there for the next five or more years while the application was processed. Myint hopes to visit him next year. During Saturday's naturalization ceremony at the Van Brunt Visitors Center, Myint blinked back tears.  "I was so happy, but I had to just relax; it was amazing that it was finally here," she said. After the ceremony, the second annual Lincoln Unites celebration was held at Auld Pavilion. The event featured 15 interactive booths, food and performances. Christa Yoakum started the event last year as a way to bring different cultures together. Yoakum is coordinator of Nebraska is Home, which is part of the nonprofit Nebraska Appleseed.  "It grew out of seeing the importance of bringing people together and really part of a national movement of being more aware of how to be welcoming and inclusive in our communities," Yoakum said. "If we want people to succeed, we have to be welcoming." Volunteers from the New American Task Force helped plan the event. Many of the those who went through the naturalization ceremony attended. For many, becoming a citizen is only the first step. American Assad, who went through the naturalization ceremony, hopes to see his wife attend college. His family moved from Iraq and he hopes to create a better future for his wife and children. Myint plans to attend college this year and hopes to become a nurse and care for the elderly. She worked for the Center for People in Need through AmeriCorps before her current job working as a cashier at Wal-Mart. "I like to take care of people, and I want to work in a nursing home. ... When I was younger and I lived in the camp, I used to take care of my grandmother before she died," Myint said. Coming to America has given her opportunities that were impossible while living in the refugee camp or even in Myanmar. "My mom has friends in Thailand and Burma (Myanmar), and when they ask about America, she says, 'Life in America is just like heaven.' We love it here." Like what you just read?
