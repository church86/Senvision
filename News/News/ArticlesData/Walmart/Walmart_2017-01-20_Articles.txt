Higher Education Elementary and Primary Education Forum Jim Guidry Commentaries Higher Education San Jacinto College News Release Friday, January 20, 2017 San Jacinto College selected as one of 12 community colleges to participate in national credentialing program for retail workers More than 1,200 workers expected to enroll in program PASADENA, Texas – The League for Innovation in the Community College has announced a $2.9 million grant from the Walmart Foundation to develop a three-part credentialing program for retail workers. San Jacinto College is one of 12 community colleges across the country selected to participate in the program, Brighter Futures 3.0, which will build on the success of the Western Association of Food Chains’ (WAFC) Retail Management Certificate (RMC).  Over the 2.5-year period of the grant, the selected colleges, based in urban, suburban and rural areas, will work with retail employers who are committed to the RMC as the credential for the advancement of their existing workforce. It is anticipated that more than 1,200 incumbent retail workers will be enrolled in the program, which seeks to break the RMC into three portable and stackable certificate programs, allowing workers a more flexible and manageable way to ultimately earn the full certificate. The League for Innovation and the WAFC will disseminate the best practices from the project to other community colleges throughout the country. In announcing the grants, League President and CEO Dr. Rufus Glasper expressed confidence that the Walmart Brighter Futures project will have a positive impact beyond the selected colleges. “The Walmart Brighter Futures 3.0 project will lead to best practices that will expand the capacity of community colleges to enhance job training opportunities for incumbent workers.  The League will be delighted to share the work of the participating colleges with colleges around the country,” said Glasper.  The project aims to scale the retail management certificate that is currently offered at more than 150 community colleges in cooperation with the Western Association of Food Chains.  Participating colleges will offer the credit certificate to incumbent workers at local and regional retail employers.  In addition to San Jacinto College, nine other community colleges have been funded for the training program, and two more are expected to be named in the future. The other nine colleges are: Alexandria Technical and Community College (Minnesota) Anne Arundel Community College (Maryland) Austin Community College (Texas) College of Lake County (Illinois) Nashville State Community College (Tennessee) Moraine Valley Community College (Illinois) Sinclair Community College (Ohio) Umpqua Community College (Oregon) Wayne County Community College District (Michigan) The selected community colleges will receive up to $100,000 over the duration of the grant to support the colleges’ plans to provide services for retail employees. Additionally, the colleges will leverage instructional stipends to support participant enrollment in courses leading to the retail management certificate.  “We are excited to be selected to participate in this project,” said Dr. Brenda Hellyer, San Jacinto College Chancellor. “We recognize and appreciate the generosity of the Walmart Foundation and the leadership of the League for Innovation in making this work possible. We look forward to working with our national partners and our local retail employers to offer a nationally-recognized credential to retail employees right here in our community.” “We understand the long-term potential of credentialing to accelerate upward mobility of frontline retail workers, by helping retail workers demonstrate the skills they have gained to their current and prospective employers, while at the same time making it easier for employers to identify workers who have the skills they need,” said Kathleen McLaughlin, president of the Walmart Foundation and chief sustainability officer for Walmart. “We know that this work is important for the retail industry at large and that’s why we’re supporting the League’s efforts to make this credential more accessible to thousands of retail workers seeking to gain new skills and grow in their careers.” About the League for Innovation in the Community College The League for Innovation in the Community College (League) is an international nonprofit organization with a mission to cultivate innovation in the community college environment.

(Reuters) Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s plans were under way Friday to cut nearly 1,000 corporate jobs.  Continue Reading Below The layoffs, which occurred in midday closed-door meetings in Bentonville, Ark., affected employees involved with the retailer's supply chain, known as "replenishment," a person familiar with the situation said. They are expected to continue through the end of the month, executives familiar with the process said, as workers in human resources, technology and e-commerce are cut.  The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month that Wal-Mart planned to trim its workforce by Jan. 31, the end of its fiscal year.  Last Friday, the retailer said several top executives would leave the company and it would reshuffle responsibility for others to focus on both store and e-commerce operations.  "To fuel our growth and our investments we have to manage our costs," its chief executive, Doug McMillon, wrote in a memo to staff reviewed by the Journal last Friday. "From time to time, you'll see the company eliminate positions in an effort to stay lean and fast."  Wal-Mart's cuts Friday come as the U.S.'s largest private employer, along with much of corporate America, is navigating a difficult balancing act: working to follow through on investor promises to create leaner operations while placating Mr. Trump's new administration by highlighting U.S. job growth.  Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT Several major companies, including General Motors Co. and Amazon.com Inc., have touted the creation of thousands of new jobs since Mr. Trump was elected, though many of those openings already were in the works.  Wal-Mart has planned to both add and cut jobs this year. Days after the Journal reported on the company's layoff plans, Wal-Mart said it would create 10,000 new U.S. jobs this year.  Although those positions stem mostly from existing efforts to open and remodel stores and represent less than 1% of its U.S. workforce, the announcement elicited a "thank you" tweet from Mr. Trump.  For much of the last two years, Wal-Mart executives have emphasized the company's commitment to lowering operating costs. Mr. McMillon has repeatedly told investors the company is willing to pare its workforce and stores when necessary to invest in boosting e-commerce sales and improving existing stores, areas he believes will provide growth in the future.  Since early 2016, Wal-Mart has cut more than 18,000 U.S. jobs through closing stores, trimming staffing at some locations and cutting jobs at its headquarters.  It is also working to stay connected to the new administration. In December, Mr. Trump's transition team said Mr. McMillon would be part of his "strategic and policy forum," along with over a dozen other CEOs.  What do you think?

From Wal-Mart to General Motors to Amazon, a growing number of the world's largest companies appear to be trying to get in step with President Donald Trump's demand that employers hire and keep jobs at home. By JOSH BOAK, Associated Press Published: January 20, 2017, 4:12 PM A   A WASHINGTON — From Wal-Mart to General Motors to Amazon, a growing number of the world’s largest companies appear to be trying to get in step with President Donald Trump’s demand that employers hire and keep jobs at home. Trump, in response, has taken to Twitter to signal his approval. “Thank you to General Motors and Walmart for starting the big jobs push back into the U.S.!” he tweeted Tuesday afternoon. Yet it’s unclear just how many jobs are actually being saved or created as a result of Trump’s push or whether his administration will hold companies accountable for their pledges. In a solid job market with just 4.7 percent unemployment, hundreds of thousands of U.S. jobs are added all the time for a broad range of reasons. Trump has boasted that he deserves the credit based on what chief executives have told him, despite evidence to the contrary provided by those same companies. “Ask top CEO’s of those companies for real facts. Came back because of me!” the then-president-elect declared on Twitter on Wednesday. GM announced Tuesday that it was creating or keeping 7,000 jobs, while Wal-Mart said it planned to hire 10,000 and support an additional 24,000 construction jobs with store openings and expansions. Those announcements followed Amazon’s commitment to add 100,000 workers through mid-2018 and a bold claim by the Chinese online retailer Alibaba that it would create 1 million U.S. jobs over the next five years. That extravagant pledge would make Alibaba alone responsible for over 10 percent of all jobs added each year — an unheard-of feat in the modern economy. Many economists say the hiring being celebrated by Trump reflects, more than anything, the health of the $18.7 trillion economy he is inheriting. “Between the election and today, unless you work on Capitol Hill in D.C., nothing fundamental has changed in the U.S. labor market,” said Andrew Chamberlain, chief economist at the jobs site Glassdoor. To these economists, the latest high-profile hiring announcements suggest that companies are capitalizing on the politically charged climate. Trump has berated companies such as Nabisco for shuttering domestic plants in order to open factories in Mexico, while celebrating companies that publicly commit to hiring in the United States. What’s more, nearly every major U.S. employer has tax and regulatory issues before the government. To that end, a sympathetic ear in the White House could be helpful. ‘Opportunism’ The heads of German chemical company Bayer and seed-and-herbicide-maker Monsanto met with Trump last week to pitch the benefits of a planned-for merger of the two companies that requires antitrust clearance. And Trump proudly tweeted reports Wednesday that Bayer would add U.S. jobs. By announcing new jobs, companies can use any existing hiring plans to ingratiate themselves with Trump by hitching their plans to his economic agenda, noted Patrick O’Keefe, director of economic research at the consultancy and accountant CohnReznick. “There is a degree of opportunism — in a positive way,” O’Keefe said. GM plans to invest $1 billion in its U.S. factories and to create or keep 7,000 jobs — moves that the company had said were being planned well before the election. Trump had drawn attention to GM this month by threatening on Twitter to tax the automaker for selling Mexican-built cars in the United States. That set up GM’s jobs announcement as a coup for Trump, even though the investment was already in the works. A GM spokesman said it was “good timing for us to share what we are doing.” Wal-Mart’s hiring similarly seems somewhat independent of Trump. The jobs stem largely from plans to open and remodel stores — work that would not be outsourced overseas. Wal-Mart is the nation’s largest private employer, with 1.5 million workers in the United States, and its hiring rate this year will be similar to prior years, said Lorenzo Lopez, a company spokesman. These announcements follow hiring plans announced by Ford and Fiat Chrysler, among others. The auto executives were willing to let Trump promote their hiring plans, even though their decisions involved other market forces, including increased demand for SUVs as gasoline prices have dropped. Market matters Hyundai said Tuesday that it plans to invest $3.1 billion by 2021 on research and development at its factories in Alabama and Georgia. Chung Jin Haeng, chief executive of the South Korean automaker, said the decision had little to do with Trump. “The U.S. market is strategically important,” he said. At the same time, Trump has also talked with companies about cutting their costs — a move that often involves slashing jobs. He met Tuesday, for example, with the CEO of Boeing, a company he had criticized in December over Twitter for the “out of control” price of two new planes for the Air Force One fleet. CEO Dennis Muilenburg said he chatted with Trump about how to lower the costs for the presidential planes as well as fighter aircraft. “I think Mr. Trump is doing a great job with engaging the business,” Muilenburg said afterward. “We’re all on the same page here.” Not all the job announcements will necessarily come to fruition. Alibaba has said it expects to add a million U.S. companies to its online retail platform in the next five years. It asserted that sales to Chinese consumers would lead each of those companies to add, on average, one job each. This would translate into an astounding 250,000 a jobs a year in an economy in which every employer, combined, added 2.2 million jobs in 2016. “It’s not rocket-science math,” said company spokesman Brion Tingler, who nevertheless cautioned that the 1 million jobs being publicized were an “aspiration.” Other than his social media megaphone, Trump doesn’t appear to have the means to hold companies accountable for their jobs pledges. His transition team didn’t respond to questions about how it planned to ensure that CEOs’ promises to create U.S. jobs were fulfilled.

Photo: Red Huber, Associated Press Orlando officer was shot 4 times, autopsy shows 1 / 1 Back to Gallery ORLANDO — An autopsy shows that an Orlando police officer gunned down outside a Walmart last week was struck four times and the fatal shot hit her neck, apparently as she lay on her back, according to an arrest affidavit filed Friday. The bullet from the fatal shot appeared to strike concrete, suggesting that Lt. Debra Clayton was on her back, according to the affidavit. Security video showed Markeith Loyd running out of the store and Clayton pursuing him about 10 feet behind after the lieutenant was told by a Walmart customer that Loyd was wanted in the fatal shooting of his pregnant ex-girlfriend last month. Loyd took cover behind a concrete pillar and fired at Clayton, striking and fracturing her hip. Clayton was on her back when Loyd approached her, the affidavit said. “Clayton fires her weapon from her back seven times at the suspect as he stands over her firing,” the affidavit said. The affidavit said Loyd had on a bulletproof vest, and he was wearing body armor when he was arrested Tuesday night. He was injured by officers while being taken into custody. Loyd told detectives that the fatal shooting might not have happened if the lieutenant “had waited for backup.” “She pulled her gun out first,” Loyd told detectives, according to the affidavit. Loyd, 41, claimed self-defense when asked by detectives about the slaying of his ex-girlfriend, Sade Dixon. The suspect appeared in court Friday for five charges related to Clayton’s killing and he was more subdued than the day before when he appeared on charges related to Dixon’s killing, though Loyd still interrupted and refused to answer questions. In Clayton’s shooting, Loyd faces charges of first-degree murder, attempted first-degree murder of a law enforcement officer, carjacking, aggravated assault and wearing a bulletproof vest while committing an offense. The judge set no bond for the first three charges, guaranteeing that Loyd will stay in jail until his trial. Loyd’s went on a profanity-laced rant Thursday that ended when he said “f— you” to the judge. Mike Schneider is an Associated Press writer.

Red Huber, AP Comment Share Tweet Stumble Email ORLANDO, Fla. -- An autopsy shows that an Orlando police officer gunned down outside a Wal-Mart last week was struck four times and the fatal shot hit her neck, apparently as she lay on her back on the ground, according to an arrest affidavit filed Friday. The bullet from the fatal shot appeared to be impacted by concrete, suggesting that Lt. Debra Clayton was on her back, according to the affidavit. Orlando police officers salute as the body of Master Sgt. Debra Clayton (pictured in the inset image) is taken from a hospital after she was shot and killed on Monday, Jan. 9, 2016. Orlando Police Department Security video showed Markeith Loyd running out of the store and Clayton pursuing him about 10 feet behind after the lieutenant was told by a Wal-Mart customer that Loyd was wanted in the fatal shooting of his pregnant ex-girlfriend last month. Loyd took cover behind a concrete pillar and fired at Clayton, striking and fracturing her hip. Clayton was on her back when Loyd approached her, the affidavit said. “Clayton fires her weapon from her back seven times at the suspect as he stands over her firing,” the affidavit said. Clayton was promoted from sergeant to lieutenant after her death. The affidavit said Loyd had on a bulletproof vest, and he was wearing body armor when he was arrested Tuesday night. Loyd told detectives that the fatal shooting might not have happened if the lieutenant “had waited for backup.” “She pulled her gun out first,” Loyd told detectives, according to the affidavit. Loyd, 41, claimed self-defense when asked by detectives about the killing his ex-girlfriend, Sade Dixon. The affidavit alleges Loyd used the same gun to kill Dixon and Clayton, reports CBS affiliate WKMG.  A day after an expletive-laced court appearance on charges in Dixon’s death, the ex-fugitive was more subdued but still interrupted a judge when he went before her on five new charges filed against him in Clayton’s death. Loyd was charged Thursday evening with first-degree murder, attempted first-degree murder of a law enforcement officer, carjacking with a firearm, aggravated assault, and wearing a bulletproof vest while committing an offense in connection with Clayton’s death, reports WKMG. Judge Jeanette Bigney set no bond for the first three charges and a total of $30,000 for the last two, guaranteeing that Loyd will stay in jail pending his trial. During an initial hearing Thursday morning on charges related to his ex-girlfriend’s death, Loyd went on a profanity-laced rant that ended when he said “f---you” to the same judge.     Loyd appeared defiant throughout Friday’s hearing, which lasted less than two minutes. When the judge asked for Loyd’s name, he was silent. “I recognize you from yesterday. Corrections, is this Mr. Loyd, Markeith Loyd?” the judge said. Then, as Bigney read the new charges related to Clayton’s killing, Loyd interrupted with, “May I have your name, please?” When the judge asked if Loyd would like a public defender to represent him, he said, “Your name is, ma’am?” On Thursday, Loyd repeatedly used profanities and accused authorities of “making up” allegations against him. He accused police of assaulting him during his arest Tuesday after a nine-day manhunt and said he didn’t resist. Loyd appeared with injuries to his face and a bandage over his eye on Thursday and Friday.   Orlando police released video of the arrest Thursday, in which a police officer can be seen apparently kicking Loyd in the head. Orlando Police Chief John Mina said officers used force because Loyd didn’t obey commands. Mina’s department is launching a use-of-force investigation. At a Thursday  press conference, Mina called Loyd a “violent, dangerous and unpredictable” person and said officers showed “incredible restraint” during the arrest. Mina said Loyd could have turned himself in, but chose not to. “We were the ones who found him,” Mina said. © 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

But some of its innovations seem to be solutions looking for a problem. By Clifford F. Lynch Comment Several years ago, I wrote that of all the trends I'd followed during my career, the three with the biggest impact on supply chain management were technology, globalization, and Walmart. Recently, a colleague asked me if I was ready to add a fourth, which of course would be Amazon. A good question, but at this point, I'm not so sure. Let's look at Walmart. When Sam Walton opened the first Walmart store in 1962, he probably had no idea he'd be changing the nation's retail landscape. By the 1970s, Walmart had begun its march through small-town America, then not-so-small-town America, and finally the world. By 2015, the company had 2.3 million employees and was serving 200 million customers weekly in 11,000 stores in 27 countries. Its rapidly expanding business—fueled by vast product selection and low prices—left thousands of casualties in its wake, as neighborhood hardware, appliance, apparel, and other businesses collapsed under the weight of the competition. A big factor in Walmart's rapid ascent to the top of the retail heap was its hyperefficient supply chain. Unlike many of its competitors, Walmart spent decades honing its supply chain operations to help hold down costs and by extension, prices. It developed logistics/distribution techniques that elevated efficiency to new levels and led the way in the adoption of automated warehouses, huge cross-dock facilities, top-notch technology, and sustainability programs. Although designed to enhance Walmart's own operations, these moves had a much more far-reaching effect. They also served as models for others, and ultimately, changed the supply chain game. Is Amazon in the same league? Let's look at its record to date. Certainly, Amazon has changed the face of online retailing. E-commerce sales were up 19 percent in 2016, while traditional retailers experienced a 10-percent decline. Much of that increase went to Amazon, and its share of the pie is expected to grow. Just as happened with Walmart in the 1970s, Amazon's rise is having a devastating effect on the competition. Through September 2016, 14 major U.S. retailers, including Macy's and Sears, had each closed 100 or more stores. As for supply chain impact, what Amazon has done is speed up the entire selling and delivery cycle. It has set a new standard where order delivery is concerned, creating a climate in which consumers have come to expect next-day or even same-day deliveries (and leaving its competitors scrambling to provide the same level of service). Among other innovations, Amazon has opened well over 100 distribution centers to shorten the "last mile"—and these aren't run-of-the-mill DCs. Thanks to its 2012 purchase of robotics innovator Kiva, most of these buildings are equipped with high-tech 'bots to boost order fulfillment efficiency. As far as its contribution to the body of supply chain knowledge, I do not see much. Amazon obviously employs some very sharp minds, but some of its innovations seem to be solutions looking for a problem. Drones are certainly a part of our future, but I do not see delivering pizzas or shoes as their highest and best use. As for its latest innovation—a plan to use blimps as airborne warehouses equipped with drones to make speedy deliveries—the notion of a DC in the sky is pretty exciting stuff and has Star Trek fans salivating as they await Captain Kirk's assumption of command. But a practical contribution to the supply chain field? I don't think so. These are uncertain times for the supply chain manager. Amazon and others are not just accommodating change but are part of it, and supply chain managers must re-educate themselves accordingly. At the same time, we must separate the hype from the reality. This is not the first seismic change we've seen in supply chain management, and it won't be the last. #Supply Chain Management #Logistics About the Author Clifford F. Lynch Columnist Clifford F.

(Shutterstock) Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Pinterest Email The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is alleging that the nation’s largest private employer violated the Americans with Disabilities Act by firing a longtime employee with Down syndrome. Marlo Spaeth worked at a Wisconsin Walmart store for 15 years, receiving multiple pay raises and satisfactory performance reviews, when managers changed her schedule, according to a lawsuit filed this week in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin. Spaeth, who was accustomed to working the hours of noon to 4 p.m., was expected to work later hours and longer shifts assigned by the retailer’s new computerized scheduling system. However, because of her Down syndrome, she struggled with the change in routine and was disciplined for absenteeism and ultimately terminated, the complaint said. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below After she was fired, Spaeth’s sister and guardian, Amy Stevenson, stepped in and asked Walmart to rehire Spaeth and allow her to work her regular afternoon shift as a reasonable accommodation, but Walmart refused, the suit alleges. “Walmart’s refusal to accommodate such a simple scheduling request here is not only a violation of the ADA, it’s also an example of how easily a successful 15-year career can be harmed by disability discrimination,” said Gregory Gochanour, a regional attorney for the EEOC’s Chicago District. The federal commission said it tried unsuccessfully to reach a settlement with Walmart before going to court. The lawsuit asks the court to order Walmart to rehire Spaeth with back pay and compensatory and punitive damages. In a statement, Ragan Dickens, director of national media relations for Walmart, said the company’s expectations for Spaeth were clear. “When a store’s needs change, we often adjust associate schedules to meet those demands. Ms. Spaeth’s job requirements were no different. We repeatedly spoke with Ms. Spaeth about the importance of working her full work schedule and she told us she understood. Despite this, she continually failed to complete her assigned shift and that is the reason she is no longer with the company,” Dickens said. “We’re sensitive to this situation and we tried to reach an amicable resolution that would support Ms. Spaeth. We remain open to continuing those discussions, but the EEOC has not acted in her best interest.” Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Pinterest Email Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Find a Job Cabin Counselors Lead Community Organizer Special Services Manager Autism Direct Support CBDS Case Manager View all jobs Post a Job More in Money Comments DISABILITY SCOOP WELCOMES COMMENTS, THOUGH ONLY A SELECTION ARE PUBLISHED.

The affidavit filed Friday says that when detectives asked Markeith Loyd about Lt. Debra Clayton's killing, he told them, "She pulled her gun out first." Clayton approached Loyd last week outside a Wal-Mart store in Orlando after a customer pointed him out as someone wanted in the slaying of his pregnant ex-girlfriend. The affidavit says Loyd claimed self-defense when asked by detectives about his ex-girlfriend's killing. The affidavit also says Loyd was wearing a bulletproof vest similar to those used by Orlando officers when he was taken into custody Tuesday after a manhunt that lasted more than a week. ——— 1:45 p.m. An autopsy shows that an Orlando police officer gunned down outside a Wal-Mart store last week was struck four times and the fatal shot entered the right side of her neck. An arrest affidavit filed Friday says the bullet from the fatal shot appeared to be impacted by concrete, suggesting that Lt. Debra Clayton was on her back when the fatal shot was fired. The affidavit says security video shows Markeith Loyd running out of the store and Clayton pursuing him about 10 feet behind. Loyd then takes cover behind a concrete pillar and fires at Clayton, striking and fracturing her hip. The affidavit says Loyd approached Clayton, stood over her and fired at her, while the officer fired back seven times. Clayton had approached Loyd after a Wal-Mart customer identified him to the officer as a suspect wanted in the killing of his girlfriend. ——— 9:20 a.m. A day after an expletive-laced court appearance on charges he killed his pregnant ex-girlfriend, a fugitive was more subdued but still interrupted a judge when he went before her on five new charges filed against him in the death of Orlando police officer. Markeith Loyd interrupted Judge Jeanette Bigney several times Friday to ask her to state her name. But the judge kept talking and set no bond for him. During an initial hearing Thursday on charges related to his ex-girlfriend's death, Loyd went on a profanity-laced rant that ended when he said "f---you" to the judge. Lt. Debra Clayton was gunned down Jan. 9 while attempting to capture Loyd. Loyd's former girlfriend, Sade Dixon, was fatally shot at her home last month. ——— 7:50 a.m. A day after an expletive-laced court appearance on charges he killed his pregnant ex-girlfriend, a fugitive is due in court again in Florida to face five new charges filed against him in the death of an Orlando police officer. The latest charges against 41-year-old Markeith Loyd include first-degree murder of a law enforcement officer and wearing a bullet-proof vest. His initial appearance is scheduled Friday morning. During an initial hearing Thursday on charges related to his ex-girlfriend's death, Loyd went on a profanity-laced rant that ended when he said "f---you" to Judge Jeanette Dejuras Bigney. He also said he plans to represent himself. Lt. Debra Clayton was gunned down Jan. 9 while attempting to capture Loyd. In December, Sade Dixon was fatally shot at her home. Loyd, who was injured and hospitalized after his Tuesday night arrest, says he didn't resist officers' commands. 0 Shares Email Star Comments The Latest: Suspect in Officer Killing: She Pulled Gun First " Trump Orders Suspension of All Refugees, Immigrants From Some Muslim Nations " Trump Called National Park Service Upset Over Inauguration Crowd Retweet " Vice President Mike Pence Tells March for Life: 'Life Is Winning Again in America' " Seasonal Flu Reaches Epidemic Levels in US " Trump Says He'll Let Defense Secretary 'Override' Him on Torture After New Rape Lawsuit, Baylor Says Made 'Great Progress' " Trump, Mexico's President Speak by Phone " Putin Consults His Security Council Before Talking to Trump " Mumps Outbreak Worsens in Washington State " Army Veteran, Double-Amputee Finds New Battlefield in DC " Georgia Town Leaders Apologize for 1940 Lynching " In Iowa, Trump Voters Cheer Changes, Dismiss Petty Fights " Ivanka Trump's Son Crawls for First Time in White House " Holocaust Site Spurs Questions on Young Germans' Changing Views " Philadelphia Mayor: Trump's Remarks an 'Insult' to Police " New Trump Agency Memo Gags Staff Communications, Democrats Say " Little Girl Befriends Baby Cow Who Lost Its Mom " NASA Opens Exhibit on 50th Anniversary of Apollo 1 Fire " FBI Offers Up to $10K Reward for Information in Murder of ABC Chicago Producer in Belize " 'Hamilton' Actors to Sing 'America the Beautiful' at Super Bowl LI " Inside Taylor Swift's $25 Million Beverly Hills Mansion " 'Bear' the Dog Hoping to Find a New Forever Home

It’s one avenue for survival when the alternatives are going discount or going dark. Though the cost-plus format first gained traction in Texas and the Deep South nearly 20 years ago, increasingly price-competitive conditions in places like the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic states have sparked the new wave, which has been helped along by a new licensed cost-plus format program from wholesaler Supervalu known as Shoppers Value Foods. Supervalu, as of late last year, said there were about 511 cost-plus stores total in the U.S. but expected more than 700 by the end of this year. That’s growth of about 37%. Supervalu supplied 83 of those 511 cost-plus locations, officials said last year, which generated sales of about $800 million. Not every store is an ideal candidate to be changed to a cost-plus format, and not every conversion works, sources note. Most importantly, retailers say, successfully executing the concept means committing to it fully, even in those times when doing so seemingly interferes with retail muscle memory. “I’m 29 years old. I’ve grown up in the grocery business and never had another job in my life. Everything I’ve ever done has revolved around either school or a grocery store,” explained Corey Facemire, a second-generation operator of six grocery stores based in Gassaway, W.Va., three of which have been flipped to the Shoppers Value Food cost-plus format since 2015. “This Shoppers Value program comes in and it’s like, ‘All right, everything you know about grocery stores, throw it out the window.’ It doesn’t work anymore.” Suppressing the instinct to think about the store as a collection of varying margin percentages to blend has not been easy, Facemire admits. “You need to find one of those ‘Men in Black’ to erase your mind and start all over,” he said. The need to have done so, he acknowledges, is not science fiction.  Photo: ValuCheck Harsh realities The cost-plus movement is rooted in a few unpleasant realities for independent retailers. It acknowledges the transformative effect that Wal-Mart Stores has had on the grocery industry; the reaction to it by large chain grocers like Kroger, which have worked to narrow Walmart’s pricing leadership; and by the growing influence of hard discounters like Aldi and Save-A-Lot and dollar stores selling food. When these forces are all at work in slow-growing markets, and where consumers themselves are struggling amid rising costs for housing and healthcare, the independent grocer is often the first to feel the pinch. “What we were looking at is the same challenge that every independent grocer in the country is stared in the face with: West Virginia has been inundated with Walmart; Kroger has been here a long time; and those two have kind of gotten into a quarrel with each other over who’s the real big dog on the grocery block,” Facemire explained. “Those two getting into it wasn’t beneficial to anybody in the independent market.” Facemire said he was at a loss as to how to address falling sales at his stores that competed with Walmart and Kroger when his Supervalu representative encouraged him to attend a seminar on the new Shoppers Value Food licensed format in 2014. “I didn’t think this was something I wanted to do,” he said, “but before long the wheels were turning.” Facemire converted his first store, a Foodland location in Huntington, W.Va., to Shoppers Value in the spring of 2015. Pleased with the results of the first change, Facemire flipped two additional stores to the Shoppers Value format last summer. Niemann Foods introduced cost plus under the Valu Check banner at two struggling conventional supermarket sites last year. Owen Miller, Niemann’s senior director of perishable buying, who is also heading up the Valu Check expansion, said the company had previously tried to remake one of the units into a discount store only to encounter customer satisfaction issues due to reduced selection. Neimann patterned its cost-plus model on that of Lowe’s Markets in Texas, which has a mature fleet of cost-plus stores and whose officials participate in a share group with Niemann executives, Miller said. “The stores we had to convert at one time were shining stars but due to changes in the marketplace and additional competitors, that may have changed some,” Miller said. “We knew we had to do something to get some life back in them, and bring something totally different to the game than what we were doing, and from what competitors around us [Kroger, Schnucks, Meijer and Walmart] offered up as well.”  Photo: ValuCheck How it works Cost plus is about as simple as it sounds. Retailers set shelf pricing for every item in the store at their cost — the item, transportation and warehousing costs and labor to get it on the shelf — and simply charge consumers 10% of their total basket at checkout. The approach requires extreme cost discipline — most cost-plus stores do not have service delis, limit operating hours and don’t do overnight stocking. Stores aim to limit labor costs to no more than 8% of sales, sources said.  For Facemire, sacrificing deli was a painful decision. Under the Foodland banner, he took pride in store-made doughnuts and a successful birthday cake program that each had to be scrapped under the new format, while sliced sandwich meats were transferred to the meat department. In their place at one of his stores is what he calls a dollar section — in the cost-plus world, it’s actually an 88 cents department — that has done extremely well. Typically, cost-plus stores aim to do higher than average meat sales — around 28.5% of total store sales, or nearly twice conventional stores, according to David J. Livingston, a consultant with Pewaukee, Wis.-based DJL Research. Overall gross profit percentages are down vs. typical stores — about 20%, where a conventional model could show around 27% profit, Livingston added. When prices are costs, they are what they turn out to be — and one of the hurdles for cost-plus operators and their shoppers is getting used to looking at prices that don’t necessarily end in a “9.” But the vital struggle is communicating that value to shoppers, because without heavy increases in sales volume, the concept simply doesn’t work. “It has to be done on volume,” Miller insisted. “We can’t do the same volume we’d done before. We have to put more items through the registers, and more customers in our house.” Operators point to the importance of having employees who can explain the concept to shoppers, and signage making the offer clear. The Avanza chain in Denver after switching to a cost-plus model in 2008 was sued by a group of consumers who said its pricing practices were deceptive. (The chain, then a division of Nash Finch, eventually settled the case by paying six plaintiffs $700 each). “Transparency is key,” said Brian Numainville, principal of the Retail Feedback Group, who suggests that retailers attempting such a program should “over-communicate” the message. “If a retailer isn’t clear about how cost is calculated, customers might not buy into the concept.” If executed properly, cost plus can deliver powerful price perception. Facemire said his Shoppers Value stores today are priced below Kroger and about equal with Walmart on the very same items.   Photo: ValuCheck “After their second or third trip through the store [customers] didn’t care what cost plus was,” he said. “What they knew was, here was what my receipt used to look like, and I’m buying the same amount of items today, apples to apples, and now here’s what my receipt is today.”  According to Miller, sales at Valu Check since the conversion of its Pekin, Ill., store last May have increased: Meat item sales are up by as much as 100% on some weeks; produce item sales up by 50% to 75%; and grocery volume up by 35% to 45%. Operators believe meat sales in cost-plus stores outperform other categories in part because offering them at cost allows for pack sizes that under a conventional pricing scheme would be out of reach for many shoppers. Fresh meat is also a means of differentiating offerings from retailers like Walmart that don’t cut in store. “Our biggest niche is meat,” said Bill Davis, VP of A&R Supermarkets, a Calera, Ala.-based independent grocer with five supermarkets — four under a cost-plus format. “We’re thankful Walmart doesn’t have fresh-cut meat in their stores and none of the dollar stores want to try fresh meat in their stores. That’s still our niche, and we try to complement that with everything else in the store.” Davis was among the early practitioners of the cost-plus format, which swept the South in the wake of Walmart’s Supercenter tsunami of the 1990s. “The reason cost-plus came about was when Walmart started getting into the grocery business and building all these Supercenters, it put the independent grocer at a disadvantage because we just don’t have the buying power that the bigger chains have. And so for lack of a better phrase, it was Plan B,” he said. “We purchase our groceries from Associated Grocers of the South and they had come up with a cost-plus format to combat that, and that’s what we did,” Davis added. “Because when Walmart started opening up, they took 50% of our sales overnight.” Today, Davis said, competition in the area has stiffened as more formats have gotten into food.  “Down here everybody and their brother is in the EBT/SNAP game, even the Mom and Pops. People go now to Dollar General, Dollar Tree, Family Dollar, etc., and where there used to be enough margin for the independent grocer to make money in a conventional store, it’s not there anymore.” TAGS: Center Store 0 comments Hide comments Comment * More information about text formats Text format CommentsPlain text Comments Allowed HTML tags: <em> <strong> <blockquote> <br> <p> Plain text No HTML tags allowed.

Tech Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies TV Politics Business Super Bowl Ads     NES Classic In Stock At Target Stores, Updated Posted: Jan 27 2017, 2:45am CST | by Luigi Lugmayr, in News | Technology News   Photo Credit: Getty Images / Nintendo   The Target Stores keep on getting new NES Classic inventory daily. Updated. The supply of the Nintendo NES Classic Edition has pretty much completely dried up despite the ongoing high demand. Target has proven to be the best store to find a NES Classic in stock over the past week. Don't Miss: The Best CES 2017 Gadgets Updates: Jan. 27: The inventory level of the NES Classic console at Target has risen again to 7% according to BrickSeek. The Target store in Culver City South shows 8 NES consoles on hand and the Chicago Near North Target store has a whopping 12 NES Classic in stock according to Brickseek. More people had luck yesterday at ToysRUs stores. TRU stores that had the NES in stock had a dozen NES on hand. Jan. 26: The NES Classic inventory level at Target Stores has dropped to 5%. There are fewer stores with inventory. We spotted NES in stock at the Target in Los Angeles at S La Cienega Blvd. This Target has according to BrickSeek 6 NES in stock. The Walmart Stores have now a higher NES inventory level than Target with 13%. Jan. 25: Target's inventoy level of the NES Classic remains at 7%. Today the NES Classic will be available at Nintendo New York flagship store again beginning at 9am. One per guest, while supplies last. Jan. 24: Target continues to hold a 7% inventory level for the NES Classic. BrickSeek shows 4 NES in stock at Target in Norcross, 3 NES in stock at Target in Paramus, 3 NES in Flushing and 5 NES consoles in Compton. Target is spreading the still limited NES inventory to different stores each day. Type you ZIP into BrickSeek to see if you local Target has stock. If the store has NES on hand than get their early morning to be first to score a NES. NES Classic from resellers on Amazon.com have slightly increased in price again. From the lows of around $140 the best NES Classic deal is now a  $163.69 with free shipping. Jan. 23: The week is off to a good start for people trying to find a NES Classic in stock. More NES are in stock than since a long time at Target stores. The BrickSeek inventory level is at 7%. Examples of Target stores having the NES Classic in stock include Jersey City (7), Brooklyn Junction (5), West Des Moines SW (4), Evanston (3), Compton-Rancho Dom (5), and Atlanta Edgewood (3). NES Classic from resellers on Amazon.com have dropped below $150. The best NES Classic deal is a $148.99 with free shipping. Jan. 22: Despite a low inventory level of 3%, we just spotted many Target locations in area code 10001 with NES in stock according to BrickSeek data. Target at Atlantic Terminal shows 7 NES on hand, the Harlem Target has 6 on hand, College Point carries 9 and Clifton shows 7. Bronx-Throggs Neck has 3 NES Classic on hand and Riverdale 7. Sunday morning looks bright for NES hunters in New York. Several people have been able to score a NES Sunday morning. It takes a lot of commitment to get up early on a Sunday morning, but now these people can crawl back under their blanket and play the NES Classic Edition all Sunday long. We spotted many NES hunters to throw in the towel and purchase a NES Classic from a reseller on Amazon.com, as prices hava dropped to below $150. The best NES Classic deal is a $143.99 with free shipping from a store with 100% positive and close to 200,000 ratings. Jan. 21: The Target inventory level of NES dropped to 3% from 6%. This means that it will be harder to find a NES at Target this weekend. Best Buy sold some NES Classic online on Friday around noon. There is an unconfirmed rumor that ToysRUs stores will get solid supply of NES consoles on January 26. We work on confirming this rumor. If true, it could be the biggest chance in a long time to get a NES Classic. Target stores are the best bet to find a NES Classic Edition. We have spotted many Target stores with NES inventory on BrickSeek over the past week. The overall in-stock score for Target stores has settled at 6%. It has been at 2% of the previous weeks. The Target warehouse is doing a great job in distributing the limited inventory to as many different stores. Each night we spot other stores with NES classic inventory than the previous day. Why only Target keeps getting new NES Classic inventory is unclear. Today we spotted 11 NES Classic in stock on BrickSeek at the Target Store in West Hollywood. This is the most we have seen in a long time. The inventory score is still at 6% for Target. Walmart is only at 1%. There is renewed interest in the NES after hackers found a way to add more games to the NES Classic that increases the pressure on the NES supply. New tools make it easy for NES owners to open up the system and install more games. The instructions to hack the NES Classic Edition are available. The reseller prices of the NES Classic have come down a bit after the Holidays, but are now increasing again to $150 plus shipping on amazon.com. To check if a Target store near you has NES Classic consoles in stock, visit brickseek.com. As the number of NES per store is very low, it is essential to be as early as possible in the line if there is one. Keep your eyes also on the NES Classic bundle offer on GameStop.com. Walmart stores still just show a 1% in stock score. There is no change there. It is easier to find NES Classic controllers Amazon now, although they are not from Nintendo. The Nyko MiniBoss Wireless Controller for NES Classic Edition in stock in select Zip codes for $17.95. The 8Bitdo NES30 Classic Edition Wireless Controller Set with Bluetooth Retro Receiver is also in stock for $39.99. Nintendo has not resupplied retailers with the NES Classic in a significant way. The in stock level of the NES at Target stores is at 5% according to BrickSeek. Chances that your local Target has the NES in stock are very low right now. NES hunters check the BrickSeek data of their local Target stores before midnight to see if a store will sell NES the next morning. In the unlikely case their is a NES in stock, buyers have to get to the store still early before the doors open. The demand is still extremely high. Resellers offer the NES on the Amazon marketplace are $191 and up. People report to have found a NES Classic in stock at stores including Target and Walmart. The tool of choice to spot the limited NES inventory is as always Brick Seek. The SKU for the NES is 207-29-0180. The service is working best for Target stores. The reported numbers are always to be taken with a grain of salt. The discussion group at InStockNow's NES tracking page is a good starting point ot find leads to stores that have the NES in stock.  Nintendo is under criticism for bad demand forecasting since years. Part of it is intentional as shortage generates buzz. The downside are the countless hours of people spent in line and the caused frustration. There is no update from Nintendo when the Japanese video game maker will resolve the shortage. The $59.99 Nintendo NES Classic Edition console launched on November 11 in stores and online. The supply was extremely constraint in stores and especially online. On launch day Nintendo said: "The Nintendo Entertainment System: NES Classic Edition system is a hot item, and we are working hard to keep up with consumer demand. There will be a steady flow of additional systems through the holiday shopping season and into the new year. Please contact your local retailers to check availability." Nintendo did not make any further comments about the NES Classic supply situation since then. Nintendo of America President Reggie Fils-Aime tried to explain last week in an interview why the NES is suffering a shortage.  "When we looked at that proposition what we believed was the adults, 30-40 years old, who grew up playing NES as a kid, 10 years old or so but had stepped away from the gaming category--that was going to be the buyer," Fils-Aime said to GameStop. "As we thought about that, that led us to a certain level of supply. The reality, however, was that the lapsed gamer and the "more active gamer" bought the NES Classic." This is a poor excuse. Nintendo apparently does not do focus groups ahead of console launches. The palm-sized NES console, retailing for $59.99 list price, features the classic Nintendo NES controller many geeks have grown up with. The retro console comes pre-installed with 30 classic NES games including Super Mario Bros., Pac-Man, Metroid, Donkey Kong, The Legend of Zelda and Kirby's Adventures. The NES Classic Edition system is a miniaturized version of the groundbreaking NES, originally released in 1985. The NES Classic Edition comes only with a single wired controller. There are 3rd party controllers and accessories that make the NES more fun to use. Gamers can get additional controllers and even wireless controllers. The Holiday shopping season 2016 has been dominated by the hunt for Hatchimals and the Nintendo NES classic edition. In a short two months the new Nintendo Switch will go sale and Nintendo fans brace for the worst. The Nintendo Switch pre-order are sold out. The supply situation might no be as bad as for the NES, but it will be difficult to get a Switch at launch for customers who have not pre-ordered the Switch.

No sooner does he slam a fist on his desk, demanding that companies add American jobs, than they issue press releases promising to oblige. Wal-Mart will add 10,000 jobs, it announced earlier this week. General Motors plans to invest $1 billion and add 7,000 U.S. jobs, it said. Bayer AG, the German pharmaceutical giant, promised to invest $8 billion in America, and add 3,000 jobs. And soon. Trump thinks it's all terrific! "Thank you to General Motors and Walmart for starting the big jobs push back into the U.S.!" he tweeted on Jan. 17. VIDEOS TOP JOBS When NBC pointed out that these jobs had nothing to do with Trump's exhortations, he quickly shot back the next day: "to the U.S., but had nothing to do with TRUMP, is more FAKE NEWS. Ask top CEO's of those companies for real facts. Came back because of me!" He has also met with a number of other top executives, including Randall Stephenson, the chief executive of AT&T, and Dennis Muilenburg, Boeing's CEO. In both cases, the two CEOs came across as supplicants who had arrived at Trump Tower to kiss the ring of the new king. Which, of course, is exactly what Trump wanted. But upon closer inspection, you have to wonder whether it's Trump who is gaming the companies, or the companies that are gaming the incoming president. It's not just that those 10,000 new Wal-Mart jobs were always part of the company's plan for 2017 -- the new employees will mainly staff new stores -- it's also the kind of jobs they represent. Although Wal-Mart has become a little less stingy in recent years, its entry-level wage is still only around $10 an hour. Meanwhile, as Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Jennifer Bartashus has noted, Wal-Mart is "cutting costs by eliminating more non-customer-facing jobs." In other words, Wal-Mart is cutting the good jobs while expanding the bad jobs. This is not exactly a strategy to Make America Great Again. The General Motors announcement was even more of a scam. Days before the GM news, Trump had complained the Chevy Cruze was built in Mexico-and he threatened to impose a border tax. Indeed, he wants all the car companies to reduce their Mexico operations and start bringing those jobs back to the U.S. But it's never going to happen, for two reasons. First, most American sedans can't be made profitably in U.S. factories; the margins are too small. Second, Mexico has made itself an attractive place to make cars, with worker training programs, incentives for manufacturers and the like. The result is that Mexico is becoming to auto manufacturing what China is to tech manufacturing. By making its announcement about 7,000 jobs, GM was able to distract the president-elect from the hard facts about building cars in Mexico. The announcement had no specifics, but never mind. Trump got to pat GM on the back and declare victory. And the Mexico issue went away -- at least for now. Bayer? It wants to take over Monsanto, and it will need regulatory approval from the new administration. So the CEOs of both companies met with Trump and emerged from the meeting promising additional jobs for Monsanto as well as billions in new investments. Naturally, the Trump team took credit for the new job promise. Hey, wait a minute. What are these two company executives doing lobbying the incoming president about a merger? Isn't the Justice Department supposed to have the final say on whether a merger can go through or not, based its reading of the nation's antitrust laws? And isn't the president supposed to defer to the antitrust experts in his administration? Of course he is. The last president who got directly involved in helping a company avoid antitrust problems was Richard Nixon. The company was ITT. It didn't work out so well. It's possible, I suppose, that Trump knows this is something presidents are supposed to leave to the Justice Department, and he just doesn't care. But it's just as likely that he doesn't know any better, and that the companies are taking advantage of his naivete -- and his ego -- to make what amounts to an ex-parte appeal for their deal. Indeed, another CEO who visited Trump to plead for a merger was AT&T's Stephenson. AT&T wants to buy Time Warner -- a deal that Trump had vowed to block on the campaign trail, claiming it would bring about a "concentration of power." After the meeting? In an interview with Mike Allen and Jim Vandehei of the new online news site Axios, Trump backed away. "I haven't seen any of the facts, yet," he said. » Next page...

Source: http://news.walmart.com/ Wal-Mart Stores Inc’s says that the 10,00 new jobs will be the result of it opening, expanding and relocating 59 stores. This also includes Sam’s Club locations and e-commerce services. The efforts will be part of its fiscal 2017 year, which starts on Feb. 1, 2017. Wal-Mart Stores Inc also notes that the opening, expanding and relocating of stores will result in the creation of 24,000 construction jobs. WMT says it plans to announce more about the job creation effort during the 85th Winter Meeting of the U.S. Conference of Mayors in Washington, D.C. The increase in jobs at its stores is part of a $6.8 billion investment the company is planning for 2017. It also includes opening 160 new training Academies across the United States. This will bring the total number of training Academies up to 200 by July. Wal-Mart Stores Inc says that it will use its training Academies to help over 225,000 associates improve their leadership skills and understanding of their jobs in 2017. The program takes six weeks to complete. “Walmart is investing to better serve customers,” Dan Bartlett, Wal-Mart Stores Inc’s Executive Vice President for Corporate Affairs, said in a statement. “With a presence in thousands of communities and a vast supplier network, we know we play an important role in supporting and creating American jobs.” The recent announcement of Wal-Mart Stores Inc creating more jobs in the United States comes shortly before the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump. Trump has been pushing more companies to keep jobs in the United States.

Tuesday, March 29, 2011 - 02:04 Mar 29 - Wal-Mart Stores went before the Supreme Court on Tuesday to argue that the court should halt a class action sex-discrimination lawsuit brought by female employees. Jon Decker reports. ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript The U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments Tuesday in a case that could affect more than a million Wal-Mart employees, and could end up being the largest class-action sex-discrimination lawsuit ever. At issue is whether women were systematically paid less than male employees and denied promotions that went to men. Betty Dukes is a Wal-Mart employee in California and a lead plaintiff in the case. (SOUNDBITE) (English) BETTY DUKES, LEAD PLAINTIFF AND WAL-MART EMPLOYEE, SAYING : "I brought this case, because I believe that there was a pattern of discrimination at Wal-Mart, not just in my store, but I believe it is across the country. Since we have filed our lawsuits in 2001, I have heard from numerous women, telling me basically the same story as mine of disparitive treatment and lack of promotion as well as lack of pay." The justices will decide whether a small group of women can represent a huge nationwide class that may include millions of current and former employees - who accuse the world's largest retailer of discrimination. Gisel Ruiz is executive vice-president for Wal-Mart. (SOUNDBITE) (English) GISEL RUIZ, EXECUTIVE VICE-PRESIDENT FOR WALMART SAYING : "We've always had processes in place. We've had strong policies against discrimination in place, long before the lawsuit was filed. I remember learning about these policies when I joined the company and as I grew up with the company, then it became my responsibility to teach them forward. When we hear issues coming from our associates, we take action immediately. There are consequences for people who violate those policies." An eventual Supreme Court ruling, expected by late June, is likely to uphold or undo the class certification, a decision that could determine whether the lawsuit proceeds to trial. Wal-Mart, which last year recorded $14 billion in profits, has been fighting the lawsuit for over a decade. Jon Decker, Reuters.

January 20, 2017 City Mother of Accused Walmart Murderer Requests Guardianship, Power to Make Legal Decisions By Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs | January 20, 2017 LikeTweet EmailPrint More More on City Subscribe to City Follow this author The mother of the Ithaca man accused of fatally shooting a UPS driver in the Ithaca Walmart parking lot requested on Friday the power to make legal decisions for her son and to become his legal guardian. In a sworn petition filed in Tompkins County Supreme Court on Friday morning, Linda Edwards said she is the mother of Justin R. Barkley, 38, of Ithaca, and asked the court to let her make decisions in legal matters he is currently facing, handle his medical needs and manage his financial assets. Police say Barkley fatally shot William Schumacher, 52, of Candor, in the chest with a rifle on Dec. 8 before driving over the victim in a truck and fleeing to his residence on Dryden Road, beginning an eight-hour standoff with authorities until he ultimately surrendered.

Barkley “is unable to take care of his needs both health, mental, legal and financial affairs,” Edwards wrote, because two psychiatric examiners determined that he was unable to understand the court proceedings against him and assist in his own defense. “In discussions with [Barkley], he is unable to understand the nature of the situation or the actual facts/matters that had taken place,” Edwards wrote. “He is also totally unable to speak realistically, accurately or coherently about the situation which he faces.” Leaderboard 2 <a href="http://oncampusweb-d.openx.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=d282f4125a&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" ><img src="http://oncampusweb-d.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=538220188&cs=d282f4125a&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" border="0" alt=""></a> Edwards requested guardianship of Barkley for an indefinite period of time, no less than a year. Parental guardianship of a child ends on the child’s 18th birthday in New York. Reached by phone Friday evening, Edwards said she had no comment on her request for guardianship. Attorney James Baker, who is representing Barkley in his criminal case, also declined to comment. District Attorney Matthew Van Houten told The Sun that he still expects Barkley to be deemed competent when he is evaluated more thoroughly by different psychiatric examiners. Van Houten also said Edwards’ petition will not affect the criminal case in any way and that she should not be able to make legal decisions for Barkley, regardless of whether he is competent or not. “If [Edwards] is looking to have an influence on the criminal case — in other words, put herself in Mr. Barkley’s shoes — that’s not how it works,” he said. “If [Barkley] is not competent to make a decision or to participate in his own defense, there’s a process for that. It’s not letting someone else make decisions for him or to step into his shoes. Van Houten said Barkley “is able to understand what’s happening and make decisions, he just doesn’t want to,” and added that he expects Barkley to oppose his mother’s petition, the outcome of which will be determined by a Tompkins County Supreme Court judge. Edwards, in her petition, said she is suitable to act as Barkley’s guardian because she “has been his mother and intimately involved in his life. Of all of the available and willing people to carry out this function, she is the most familiar with his needs and assets.” Barkley’s truck is impounded and he may owe money on a motorcycle, Edwards wrote. She is requesting the authority to manage his financial assets, and said that he has more than $2,500 in his bank account, although she does not know the exact figure. Syracuse attorney Michael Harris, who is representing Edwards in her petition, could not immediately be reached for comment Friday evening.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on: Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink: Purchase: Order Reprint Cargill Inc., Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and two dozen more of the biggest players in food this week committed to keeping closer track of the supply chain in an effort to eliminate deforestation, especially in South America’s Amazon region. The companies — like chocolate-maker Mars, European big-box retailer Carrefour and agribusiness giant Bunge — announced the partnership Wednesday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Over the years, many global businesses have cleared large swaths of the rain forest to fill global demand for food and resources. According to nonprofit World Resources Institute, agriculture is responsible for 70 percent of all tropical deforestation. Many international corporations now recognize that cutting down trees for farmland is not sustainable for the environment or businesses. Consumers increasingly expect to know where their products come from and the process through which they were made. This agreement marks the next step for Wayzata-based Cargill in reducing the impact of its agriculture operations on the forests. Cargill already uses a technology, developed by Global Forest Watch, that assesses deforestation risk in their palm oil, soy and cocoa supply chains. This new alliance expands on that platform by allowing banks and companies to monitor the deforestation risks, through satellite imagery and real-time alerts, much like they track commodities. Cargill’s Chief Executive David MacLennan this week said in a column for the Huffington Post that “protecting forests is clearly the right thing to do.” Coinciding with the Swiss summit, the company also published this week its first progress report on the goal of eliminating deforestation practices by 2030. “On a recent trip to Brazil, we flew over the Amazon,” MacLennan wrote. “Looking out the plane window, I saw an ocean of trees blanketing the ground below. But I also saw large patches of land that had been deforested to make way for farmland. And as much as I like to see farmland, since our business depends on sourcing crops from farmers worldwide, I’d be lying if I said I didn’t feel a real sense of loss. ... Cargill knows preserving forests is imperative.” This new online data center is designed to give more insight and information to companies trying to change their practices. Globally, 366 companies worth $2.9 trillion have committed to eliminating deforestation from their supply chains.   kristen.painter@startribune.com 612.673.4767 KristenPainter View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive, mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

Related News/Archive Brandon man arrested in slaying of victim found at Tampa gas station 1 Month Ago Airport shooting suspect spent two quiet years in Alaska, but his life was falling apart 2 Weeks Ago Tampa police: Fugitive wanted in slaying of nurse captured in Louisiana 1 Month Ago He walked alone to a nearby Walmart and bought a few frozen dinners, stopped by his old house on E Paris Street, then headed toward the small, white wood-framed house on E Crenshaw Street he bought in November with Dan Kane, his partner of 30 years. He never made it there. On the way, sometime after 10 p.m., the 53-year-old Denham was punched and beaten to death by two men and a woman at the intersection of N 15th and E Elm streets, police said. Just blocks away, Kane was at his home on Hilton Place, preparing to move in with Denham. "I've always felt safe in that neighborhood and have walked down those streets myself, but now it's very scary to know something like this happened when he was just walking home," said Kane. A passing motorist called Tampa police to report that a man had been left unconscious in the road with no identification, his Walmart bags at his side, Kane said. It was about 2:30 a.m. when police finally identified Denham and knocked on Kane's door. "His whole life was helping other people," Kane said. "He didn't deserve this." Denham was light-hearted and kind, a prankster with a great memory who loved Boston Kremes at Dunkin' Donuts and his two chihuahuas, Ava and Paco. In the late 1980s, he left his three sisters and mother in Pennsauken, N.J., and moved to Florida with Kane and his best friend since seventh grade, John Layer. With a degree in social work from the University of South Florida, Denham spent most of his life working as a counselor at agencies including the Tampa AIDS Network and DACCO, as well as local methadone clinics. But the work was stressful and Denham burned out, Layer said. He made money flipping houses and waiting tables, recently on an overnight shift at Three Coins Diner on Nebraska Avenue. His struggle with addiction led to a string of arrests in Hillsborough County, but he found success in faith-based recovery programs and was a devout Christian. The Friday before he died, Denham said he wanted to return to social work and asked for help updating his resume, Kane said. "He was such a ray of sunshine, and would call me up to talk about spiritual matters and what the Bible has to say about life and his love for life and the Lord," Denham said. "I'll really miss that." Tampa police said they are still searching for the three assailants, who were seen walking south on N 15th Street after the attack. Witnesses described them as white or Hispanic. One man was in a black short-sleeve shirt, appeared to be in his 20s, and was just under 6 feet tall with a stocky build and brown, scruffy facial hair. The woman had long black hair, witnesses said. Crime Stoppers of Tampa Bay is offering a reward of up to $3,000 for information that leads to arrests; call 1-800-873-TIPS (8477), report anonymously at crimestopperstb.com or use the P3 Tips mobile app. Contact Anastasia Dawson at adawson@tampabay.com or (813) 226-3377.

Debra Clayton. Murder suspect Markeith Loyd attends his court appearance at the Orange County Jail for charges related to death of Orlando Police Lt. Debra Clayton.  (Red Huber / Tribune News Services)   By David Harris Stephanie AllenThe Orlando Sentinel Fri., Jan. 20, 2017 ORLANDO, FLA. —Markeith Loyd was wearing the same type of bulletproof vest Orlando police officers use when he opened fire on Lt. Debra Clayton, knocking her to the ground and leaving her “completely exposed,” court documents released Friday state. He was captured on surveillance video outside the northwest Orlando Wal-Mart rushing toward her, with a gun in his outstretched arm, the documents state. He then fired “several more shots in rapid succession,” before getting into his vehicle and “casually” driving away. The new details came out Friday morning after Loyd, 41, appeared in court to face charges, including first-degree murder of a law enforcement officer, related to Clayton’s death. A judge ordered he continue to be held without bail. Among the documents is an arrest affidavit that details the initial exchange between Loyd and Clayton, and an interview he had with investigators after his arrest Thursday. It also revealed that a medical examiner identified the fatal shot hit Clayton in the neck while she was lying on the ground. Article Continued Below Three backup officers made it to the store less than 45 seconds after gunshots were first heard over Clayton’s radio, the affidavit states. The officers found her on her back with several gunshot wounds and immediately started trying to save her life. Police said the surveillance video showed Loyd firing three shots at Clayton from behind a concrete pillar. One of the bullets hit her in the right hip. The other two hit parked cars. The shot knocked Clayton to the ground, but she managed to roll onto her back and raise her weapon at Loyd, the affidavit states. He then ran toward her and fired several more times. Crime scene crews found eight shell casings each from both Loyd’s and Clayton’s guns. The entire exchanged lasted just six seconds, according to the affidavit. Clayton was hit four times. ▶ The suspect in the fatal shooting of an Orlando police officer was captured Tuesday night, authorities said. Markeith Loyd is accused of killing officer Debra Clayton and his pregnant girlfriend. (The Associated Press) Police said the video then showed Loyd getting into a green Mercury car and driving away. One of the backup officers spotted the car and gave a description of it over his police radio. An Orange County Sheriff’s deputy spotted it not far away, pulling into the Royal Oaks Apartments on Pine Hills Road. The deputy followed, but before he could get out of his vehicle, Loyd opened fire on the unmarked Ford Explorer, the report states. Police then got a call from a man who said Loyd pointed a gun at him and stole his car. Police eventually found that car at the Tzadik Brookside Apartments. They also found the shirt and pants Loyd was seen wearing during the exchange at Wal-Mart. The black shirt had “SECURITY” written across it in white letters and an apparent bullet hole in the chest, but no blood, which is consistent with him wearing a protective vest, the report states. When asked about the exchange with Clayton, Loyd allegedly told investigators that “she pulled her gun out first,” the affidavit states. He said the shooting may not have happened if she had “waited for backup.” When investigators asked why he shot her instead of running away, Loyd “simply grumbled in coherently,” according to the affidavit. The affidavit also gives more details about Loyd’s arrest. Police captured him on Tuesday after tracking him to an abandoned house in the Carver Shores neighbourhood in west Orlando. They had been searching for him since Dec. 13 when he was accused of fatally shooting his pregnant ex-girlfriend, Sade Dixon. It said he threw his guns — the .40-calibre Smith and Wesson authorities say he used to kill Clayton and Dixon and a 9 mm Glock — out of a bedroom window. Both guns were loaded with rounds in the chamber. “Loyd then complied with commands and crawled on his stomach from the entry door to awaiting officers where he was placed under arrest,” the affidavit says. During the interview with investigators, Loyd also talked about that incident, saying Dixon’s brother attacked him, according to the affidavit. He said the shooting was in self-defence. —__ ©2017 The Orlando Sentinel (Orlando, Fla.)

(Red Huber/Orlando Sentinel via AP, Pool) Posted: Friday, January 20, 2017 9:04 am | Updated: 9:19 am, Fri Jan 20, 2017. The Latest: Autopsy: Officer on back when fatal shot fired Associated Press | 0 comments ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — The Latest on the fatal shooting of an Orlando police officer (all times local): 1:45 p.m. An autopsy shows that an Orlando police officer gunned down outside a Wal-Mart store last week was struck four times and the fatal shot entered the right side of her neck. An arrest affidavit filed Friday says the bullet from the fatal shot appeared to be impacted by concrete, suggesting that Lt. Debra Clayton was on her back when the fatal shot was fired. The affidavit says security video shows Markeith Loyd running out of the store and Clayton pursuing him about 10 feet behind. Loyd then takes cover behind a concrete pillar and fires at Clayton, striking and fracturing her hip. The affidavit says Loyd approached Clayton, stood over her and fired at her, while the officer fired back seven times. Clayton had approached Loyd after a Wal-Mart customer identified him to the officer as a suspect wanted in the killing of his girlfriend. ___ 9:20 a.m. A day after an expletive-laced court appearance on charges he killed his pregnant ex-girlfriend, a fugitive was more subdued but still interrupted a judge when he went before her on five new charges filed against him in the death of Orlando police officer. Markeith Loyd interrupted Judge Jeanette Bigney several times Friday to ask her to state her name. But the judge kept talking and set no bond for him. During an initial hearing Thursday on charges related to his ex-girlfriend's death, Loyd went on a profanity-laced rant that ended when he said "f---you" to the judge. Lt. Debra Clayton was gunned down Jan. 9 while attempting to capture Loyd. Loyd's former girlfriend, Sade Dixon, was fatally shot at her home last month. ___ 7:50 a.m. A day after an expletive-laced court appearance on charges he killed his pregnant ex-girlfriend, a fugitive is due in court again in Florida to face five new charges filed against him in the death of an Orlando police officer. The latest charges against 41-year-old Markeith Loyd include first-degree murder of a law enforcement officer and wearing a bullet-proof vest. His initial appearance is scheduled Friday morning. During an initial hearing Thursday on charges related to his ex-girlfriend's death, Loyd went on a profanity-laced rant that ended when he said "f---you" to Judge Jeanette Dejuras Bigney. He also said he plans to represent himself. Lt. Debra Clayton was gunned down Jan. 9 while attempting to capture Loyd. In December, Sade Dixon was fatally shot at her home. Loyd, who was injured and hospitalized after his Tuesday night arrest, says he didn't resist officers' commands. © 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

An arrest affidavit filed Friday says the bullet from the fatal shot appeared to be impacted by concrete, suggesting that Lt. Debra Clayton was on her back when the fatal shot was fired. Advertisement The affidavit says security video shows Markeith Loyd running out of the store and Clayton pursuing him about 10 feet behind. Loyd then takes cover behind a concrete pillar and fires at Clayton, striking and fracturing her hip. The affidavit says Loyd approached Clayton, stood over her and fired at her, while the officer fired back seven times. Clayton had approached Loyd after a Wal-Mart customer identified him to the officer as a suspect wanted in the killing of his girlfriend. ___ 9:20 a.m. A day after an expletive-laced court appearance on charges he killed his pregnant ex-girlfriend, a fugitive was more subdued but still interrupted a judge when he went before her on five new charges filed against him in the death of Orlando police officer. Markeith Loyd interrupted Judge Jeanette Bigney several times Friday to ask her to state her name. But the judge kept talking and set no bond for him. During an initial hearing Thursday on charges related to his ex-girlfriend’s death, Loyd went on a profanity-laced rant that ended when he said “f—you” to the judge. Lt. Debra Clayton was gunned down Jan. 9 while attempting to capture Loyd. Loyd’s former girlfriend, Sade Dixon, was fatally shot at her home last month. ___ 7:50 a.m. A day after an expletive-laced court appearance on charges he killed his pregnant ex-girlfriend, a fugitive is due in court again in Florida to face five new charges filed against him in the death of an Orlando police officer. The latest charges against 41-year-old Markeith Loyd include first-degree murder of a law enforcement officer and wearing a bullet-proof vest. His initial appearance is scheduled Friday morning. During an initial hearing Thursday on charges related to his ex-girlfriend’s death, Loyd went on a profanity-laced rant that ended when he said “f—you” to Judge Jeanette Dejuras Bigney.

Win tickets to the Rachel Ray Burger Bash at the SOBE Wine and Food Festival. Enter now! News Markeith Loyd had same bulletproof vest police wear, new reports say Markeith Loyd's 2nd appearance before judge Bigney in the murder of Lt. Debra Clayton The five new charges, which came Thursday night, include first degree murder of a law enforcement officer, attempted first degree murder and wearing a bulletproof vest. The five new charges, which came Thursday night, include first degree murder of a law enforcement officer, attempted first degree murder and wearing a bulletproof vest. David Harris and Stephanie Allen Contact ReportersOrlando Sentinel Privacy Policy Markeith Loyd was wearing the same type of bulletproof vest Orlando police officers use when he opened fire on Lt. Debra Clayton, knocking her to the ground and leaving her "completely exposed," court documents released Friday state. He was captured on surveillance video outside the northwest Orlando Wal-Mart rushing toward her, with a gun in his outstretched arm, the documents state. He then fired "several more shots in rapid succession," before getting into his vehicle and "casually" driving away. The new details came out Friday morning after Loyd, 41, appeared in court to face charges, including first degree murder of a law enforcement officer, related to Clayton's death. A judge ordered he continue to be held without bail. Among the documents is an arrest affidavit that details the initial exchange between Loyd and Clayton, and an interview he had with investigators after his arrest Thursday. It also revealed that a medical examiner identified the fatal shot hit Clayton in the neck while she was lying on the ground. Three backup officers made it to the store at the corner of Princeton Street and John Young Parkway less than 45 seconds after gunshots were first heard over Clayton's radio, the affidavit states. The officers found her on her back with several gunshot wounds and immediately started trying to save her life. Police said the surveillance video showed Loyd firing three shots at Clayton from behind a concrete pillar. One of the bullets hit her in the right hip. The other two hit parked cars. The shot knocked Clayton to the ground, but she managed to roll onto her back and raise her weapon at Loyd, the affidavit states. He then ran toward her and fired several more times. Crime scene crews found eight shell casings each from both Loyd and Clayton's guns. The entire exchanged lasted just six seconds, according to the affidavit. Clayton was hit four times. Police said the video then showed Loyd getting into a green Mercury car and driving away. One of the backup officers spotted the car and gave a description of it over his police radio. An Orange County Sheriff's deputy spotted it not far away, pulling into the Royal Oaks Apartments on Pine Hills Road. The deputy followed, but before he could get out of his vehicle, Loyd opened fire on the unmarked Ford Explorer, the report states. Police then got a call from a man who said Loyd pointed a gun at him and stole his car. Police eventually found that car at the Tzadik Brookside Apartments off Cinderlane Parkway. They also found the shirt and pants Loyd was seen wearing during the exchange at Wal-Mart. The black shirt had "SECURITY" written across it in white letters and an apparent bullet hole in the chest, but no blood, which is consistent with him wearing a protective vest, the report states. When asked about the exchange with Clayton, Loyd allegedly told investigators that "she pulled her gun out first," the affidavit states. He said the shooting may not have happened if she had "waited for backup." When investigators asked why he shot her instead of running away, Loyd "simply grumbled in coherently," according to the affidavit. The affidavit also gives more details about Loyd's arrest. Police arrested him on Thursday after tracking him to an abandoned house in the Carver Shores neighborhood in west Orlando. They had been searching for him since Dec. 13 when he was accused of fatally shooting his pregnant ex-girlfriend, Sade Dixon. It said he threw his guns – the .40-caliber Smith and Wesson authorities say he used to kill Clayton and Dixon and a 9mm Glock – out of a bedroom window. Both guns were loaded with rounds in the chamber. "Loyd then complied with commands and crawled on his stomach from the entry door to awaiting officers where he was placed under arrest," the affidavit says. During the interview with investigators, Loyd also talked about that incident, saying Dixon's brother attacked him, according to the affidavit. He said the shooting was in self-defense. sallen@orlandosentinel.com or 407-420-5417 Copyright © 2017, Sun Sentinel Crime Markeith Loyd Law Enforcement Pictures: Markeith Loyd's second court appearance Markeith Loyd refuses judge's questions at hearing for charges in Lt.

The surveillance footage, released by the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office on Wednesday, shows Michael Foster, 43, tackling Clarence Daniels from behind as he was walking into a Brandon, Fla. Wal-Mart on Tuesday. Foster followed Daniels into the store after seeing him exiting his vehicle with a gun holstered under his shirt — which was perfectly legal for the 62-year-old Daniels to do since he holds a concealed weapon license. Nevertheless, Foster tackled Daniels from behind as he entered the store, and put him in a chokehold before taking him to the ground. Witnesses said that Foster yelled out that Daniels had a gun. They also said that Daniels yelled out that he had a license for it. Foster called 911 only after he tackled accosted Daniels. He was arrested and charged with battery.

First Look Top officials at US State Department abruptly resign (+video) Photos of the day 01/27 SUBSCRIBE Raymond 'Skip' Dempsey works in his front yard in Social Circle, Ga., Thursday. Patrik Jonsson/The Christian Science Monitor | Caption Fullscreen Loading... Patrik Jonsson Staff writer | @dixiebureau January 20, 2017 Social Circle, Ga.—Having done everything from man the first cruise of the supercarrier USS America to stock shelves at Walmart, Raymond “Skip” Dempsey has now had to get used to another life accomplishment: Republican kingmaker. As Donald Trump, the man Mr. Dempsey helped lift to the White House, takes his presidential oath of office on Friday, the former Navy mechanic from upstate New York is experiencing a rainbow of feelings: excited, optimistic, concerned – and determined, in his case, to watch the incoming Trump administration like a hawk. Leaning on his rake, the grizzled Dempsey grins: “Everybody needs to relax and give him a year or two. If it doesn’t work out, impeach him.” Rural precincts like Georgia’s Walton County, buzzing with evangelical fervor, played a decisive role in giving America its 45th president. The remarkable election came with uncertainty and upheaval, already measured from the global to the personal: Dempsey says his 50-something-year-old son hasn’t talked to him since Election Night. But here on the backroads of Walton County, Trump-inspired church signs that read “From weeping to joy” and “God is doing a new thing in 2017” suggest a humbler, and perhaps more nuanced, portrait of Mr. Trump’s core support on the day of his inauguration. Could you pass a US citizenship test? Find out. Indeed, in this box-store-dotted cattle country on the fringes of metro Atlanta – a place where Trump won more than 3 out of 4 votes – the inaugural mood is hardly one of gloating. Instead, it’s notable for exuding a quiet pride in the feeling that they have moved the country forward – even though a majority of Americans seem to disapprove of the messenger and his methods. Voters here for the most part shrug off Trump’s historically low 34 percent pre-inauguration approval rating, according to a Fox News poll. After all, they say, when you upend the applecart, it upsets a lot of guys with apples. They also know that, as with any incoming administration, failure looms just as large as success, perhaps particularly so with Trump. “I know he’s a hothead because I’m one, too,” notes Dempsey. “But us hotheads need to learn to walk away and cool off. Twitter is not his friend.” Yet for many, like furniture restorer Wayne Hurst, Trump’s election has already accomplished one important thing: shaken America out of a reverie. The country, he and others here say, was declining alarmingly – heading toward a future of meager economic growth, diminished standing in the world, and callous indifference toward the working class that built America. “The Democrats kept saying, relax, time will take care of everything,” says Mr. Hurst. “Well, after eight years, we can’t afford any more time.” Less hardline than it seems To critics, that general feeling among many conservative voters is at least in part a wistfulness for a bygone America that was built on privilege – where white, working-class males were the winners at the expense of women and minorities. Trumpism is really a push to “make white America great again,” says Ed Dorn, a University of Texas public policy professor. Moreover, there is a sense among liberals that media-heckling Trump supporters can't abide criticism of their man. “This idea that the Trump supporters have seems to be that, if you are not with Trump, you are dead-set against him. There doesn’t seem to be a middle ground,” MSNBC’s Cal Perry noted. But interviews here offer a somewhat different portrait. For all the revivalist hope invested in Trump, the love, it turns out, isn’t all that deep, nor complete. On one hand, expectations among Trump voters are high, according to interviews. But because of that, there is a keen awareness that a Trump presidency could falter out of the gate. That has led many Trump supporters, on the eve of the new presidency, to cut their excitement with a healthy measure of caution, even concern. Take Hope Simpson, who sits behind the desk at Paperbacks Books in downtown Loganville, Ga., another small Walton County town. A Trump voter and mom of four, she says she will watch Trump’s inauguration with both a Biblical sense of certainty that she made the right choice and a measured excitement. Trump’s antics during the campaign were enough to drive the life-long Republican to consider someone else, but every bone in her body resisted Hillary Clinton. She downplays his comments about sexually harassing women – “something he did 30 years ago” – as water under the bridge. More heartening to her is the prevalence of Evangelicals among Trump’s cabinet nominations, which, as the Israeli newspaper Haaretz noted last week, could “give evangelical Christians a level of power and influence on American life that they never had before.” But at least in her case, that is not as hardline a stance as it sounds. On the one hand, she supports a border wall “100 percent – he has got to do that.” Yet she also echoes President Obama, who recently said that “American kids” brought here as babies and now protected by his executive orders should not be deported. “Republicans still need my vote, and they still need to earn it,” she concludes. Moreover, she cites Trump’s tendency to throw gasoline on fires – she cites the John Lewis Twitter spat – as un-presidential, and even deeply worrisome. It’s not enough to make her regret her vote. But she says her eyes are more open as inauguration approaches. “I think he can help this country if he does what he says he will do,” she says. “But if he’s not careful, I think he can also hurt it.” An upswelling of hope Across the street, in a two-story workshop built of red brick, Hurst, the furniture restorer, can hear a visitor below from the clacking of boot heels on weathered boards of Southern pine. “Come on up,” he yells. Wayne Hurst stands in his Loganville, Ga., workshop, on Thursday. Patrik Jonsson/The Christian Science Monitor | Caption Hurst has spent nearly four decades restoring furniture – the amber-colored varnish splatters on the walls prove it. Sure, Hurst has concerns about Trump, and he gets why at least some Republican voters may be having buyer’s remorse. But, personally, he says he stays assured by one fact: “Listen, the guy’s name is on the line. And to him, his name is everything. He’s not going to fail.” Follow Stories Like This Get the Monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox. Sign-Up × Hurst, too, has his name up on the side of a building. But on Friday, that building will be closed. Hurst plans to stay at home, watch the inauguration, and enjoy what he has identified as a long-lost feeling. “I feel an upwelling – an upswelling – of hope,” Hurst says. “I can feel it in my bones, in the floors.

(AP) — A man charged with fatally shooting a UPS driver outside a central New York Wal-Mart last month has been ruled mentally incompetent for trial. A Tompkins County Court judge made the ruling Thursday in the second-degree murder case against Justin Barkley. The judge committed him to a state mental health institution for evaluation. The move comes after two psychiatric examinations decided Barkley wasn't competent. Barkley was charged with killing 52-year-old William Schumacher of Candor outside the Wal-Mart in Ithaca early on the morning of Dec. 8. Authorities say Schumacher was a seasonal driver for the package delivery service when he stopped at the store to get something to eat. Prosecutors say they'll continue to pursue the case against Barkley. Law enforcement officials haven't disclosed a suspected motive in the slaying.

(REUTERS/Rebecca Cook)    4443001 Video footage taken from a Florida Wal-Mart shows a shopper literally jumping the gun. The surveillance footage, released by the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office on Wednesday, shows Michael Foster, 43, tackling Clarence Daniels from behind as he was walking into a Brandon, Fla. Wal-Mart on Tuesday. Foster followed Daniels into the store after seeing him exiting his vehicle with a gun holstered under his shirt — which was perfectly legal for the 62-year-old Daniels to do since he holds a concealed weapon license. Nevertheless, Foster tackled Daniels from behind as he entered the store, and put him in a chokehold before taking him to the ground. Witnesses said that Foster yelled out that Daniels had a gun. They also said that Daniels yelled out that he had a license for it. Foster called 911 only after he tackled accosted Daniels. He was arrested and charged with battery.

(REUTERS/Rebecca Cook)    4443001 Video footage taken from a Florida Wal-Mart shows a shopper literally jumping the gun. The surveillance footage, released by the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office on Wednesday, shows Michael Foster, 43, tackling Clarence Daniels from behind as he was walking into a Brandon, Fla. Wal-Mart on Tuesday. Foster followed Daniels into the store after seeing him exiting his vehicle with a gun holstered under his shirt — which was perfectly legal for the 62-year-old Daniels to do since he holds a concealed weapon license. Nevertheless, Foster tackled Daniels from behind as he entered the store, and put him in a chokehold before taking him to the ground. Witnesses said that Foster yelled out that Daniels had a gun. They also said that Daniels yelled out that he had a license for it. Foster called 911 only after he tackled accosted Daniels. He was arrested and charged with battery.

The competition between traditional retail players and Amazon.com Inc. extends beyond market share and sales. Retailers like Macy’s Inc. M, -2.71% which have a long history in bricks-and-mortar, are also competing for the tech talent they need to turn their businesses into the multiplatform, ease-of-use, e-commerce-enabled selling machines that customers want to buy from. But experts say traditional retailers have a perception problem. The talent they need—forward-thinking, tech-savvy, highly-skilled—are more apt to look to companies like Alphabet Inc. GOOG, -1.06% or, yes, Amazon AMZN, -0.40% as employers, rather than turn to retail for job opportunities. See also: Amazon is going to kill more American jobs than China did “Their legacy is traditional retailing, which isn’t friendly to technology,” said Christian Magoon, chief executive of Amplify Investments, the company behind a number of ETFs, including the Amplify Online Retail ETF IBUY, +0.17%  . “There’s a cultural revolution that’s going to have to happen in retail.” According to Gerry McNamara, global managing director of the information officers practice at Korn Ferry, a talent search firm, companies like Amazon are going to colleges and even high schools to start the process of convincing prospective staffers to join the team. Retailers could be a bit late in making their pitch to prospects. Retailers are also dealing with business processes that are hard to transform quickly. “They have to deal with legacy systems that are tried and true and are now being threatened by new forces,” said McNamara. “They have to digitize systems but can’t scuttle the old business.” Traditional retailers know the importance of technology to their companies. On Wednesday, Target Corp. TGT, -0.73% announced that same-store sales during the November and December holiday period fell 1.3% and total sales fell 4.9%. But December digital sales were up more than 40%. On Thursday, Goldman Sachs downgraded Target shares to sell, in large part, due to the competition with Amazon. Amazon Plans to Create 100,000 Jobs, and More(16:59) Amazon says it plans to add more than 100,000 full-time jobs in the U.S. over the next 18 months. Plus, the GOP-controlled Senate cleared a hurdle Thursday to begin their plans to repeal Obamacare. Photo: Getty And Wal-Mart Stores Inc. WMT, -1.60% which in the last year has purchased Jet.com and restructured its technology leadership, among other digital moves, said this week that e-commerce services will be a hiring focus as the company adds about 10,000 retail jobs in the coming year. Careers website Glassdoor’s report “Looking Ahead: 5 Jobs Trends to Watch in 2017” highlights Wal-Mart, saying the company’s “Silicon Valley research facility aimed at attracting machine-learning experts to help automate pricing and logistics” makes it one of the “major tech employers today.” But convincing potential employees, particularly scarce tech workers, that they should bring their skills to the retail industry is a hurdle. Only 9% of the 1,005 students polled for Accenture Strategy’s 2016 U.S. College Graduate Employment Study who are entering the job market said they would most like to work in the retail industry. Moreover, according to Eric Shea, managing director at Kurt Salmon, which is part of Accenture Strategy, many are looking to “do good” in areas like education and health care. See also: Is Amazon’s new credit card for Prime members worth it? Shea sees the problem as twofold for traditional retailers: they need store workers who can handle inventory management systems that are increasingly digital, and they need engineers and other core tech workers. The first step to attracting these staffers is customer experience. “If they show an innovative customer experience in e-commerce, mobile and in-store, they would be better perceived,” said Shea. Compensation and other incentives are an issue also. “You have to make it feel like a startup with some upside,” said Stefan Weitz, chief strategy officer at Radial, a retail technology provider. Weitz worked at Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +2.35% for 17 years. He says things like rewards for hitting a milestone, or changes that involve the company’s environment can make a position more enticing. Top-notch executives, like a capable chief information officer, are valuable too. See also: Amazon’s dominance shows up in the jobs report “You have to be savvy enough to know how all the pieces fit together to build an efficient organization and the customer experience that’s great as well,” said Shea. But a major retailer will need more than one person in this area. Many, especially large ones with complex operations and supply chains, are hiring companies to meet their needs or acquiring them outright. “We’re going to increasingly see more mergers and acquisitions,” said Amplify’s Magoon. “Traditionals will eventually have to buy the talent or buy the business model. I’m skeptical that they‘re going to be able to invent it in their current legacy organizations because the people at the top have been in that model for 20 or 30 years and change is hard.” The SPDR S&P Retail exchange-traded fund XRT, -1.34%  closed Friday down 0.2%, and has gained 7.6% in the last 12 months, underperforming the S&P 500 SPX, -0.09%  , which is up 19.1%.

Required fields are marked * Name * Email * Website  −  three  =  two Comment Some HTML is OK Sign me up for the Money Morning newsletter Shah Gilani [Editor’s Note: In March 2013, after we published this article, American Express struck a deal with Wells Fargo allowing FDIC "pass-through" insurance to cover Bluebird prepaid cards. Customer funds are now protected up to $250,000.] Here's something else that's got the potential to undermine our financial future… It's about those prepaid cards, and the games that are being played with them that you may not know about. Prepaid cards have lots of benefits, especially for the "unbanked." These are the people who more or less may live paycheck to paycheck, or don't have jobs but need a "card" because both credit and debit cards are how we pay for most things these days. A lot of people are rebelling, and rightfully so, against the higher and higher fees that banks are charging on checking accounts (and for all their other "services") and are turning to prepaid cards as an alternative means of paying for goods and services. Now, American Express (NYSE: AXP) is partnering with Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) to offer Bluebird cards. The cards are being pushed through Wal-Mart stores and are ostensibly backed by American Express. American Express? As if it's a bank. Wait a minute… It is a bank. That's because back on November 10, 2008, at the height of the credit crisis, American Express had to become a bank (actually a bank holding company) so it could take money from the Federal Reserve to stay alive. You forgot that, didn't you? And Wal-Mart, well, they have been trying to become a bank in several end-around ways. Now, they've come together. The "bank" status of American Express and its 100-year history of issuing Travelers Checks (the first prepaid cards, really) and the marketing power and reach of Wal-Mart, into the pockets of the less than wealthy and notably underbanked, has yielded a Bluebird capable of flying in the face of safe banking. There are lots of problems with the prepaid card game. My biggest problem is that there are plenty of fees attached to these types of cards. They're NOT free. A lot of the time folks aren't even aware of the fees they're paying. They just know that bank fees are higher, or at least they think they are higher, which most of the time, they are. What You Need to Know About Bluebird Then along comes Bluebird with its no-fee prepaid cards. Sounds good, right? It is for now. Join the conversation.

But wasn't it your own Martin Hutchinson who suggested only a few months ago that we should let banks go bankrupt without Depositor Insurance? Reply Judith | June 11, 2015 I recommend NO ONE purchase a Bluebird Debit (American Express) card from Walmart. Here is a list of merchants that WILL NOT ACCEPT this card: DOLLAR GENERAL J.C. PENNEY CAPITAL ONE CREDIT CARD CO TRANSFUND (KUM & GO) ATMS SOUTHSIDE VETERINARY CLINIC EAST CHINA BUFFET RESTAURANT SOME WALMARTS (Oh yeah this one really floored me!!!!!!!!!!!) Dont be a fool and get this card, You cant use your own money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. Reply Ruthie Derby | June 18, 2015 99 cent stores don't either Reply vicki | June 27, 2015 do these companies not take the card because it's bluebird, or because it's amex? if it's because it's amex… well, not everyone takes amex, and you'd have to figure out a way around that. just like not everyone takes discover. find a nearby ATM. *shrug* if they don't take bluebird specifically… i'd complain. it's an amex card, and there's no reason for them NOT to take it Reply Melissa | August 5, 2015 A dollar general took my bluebird card Reply annabanana | September 29, 2015 Hey the card can be use at Dollar General, its basically their option to allow your or not. The cost for your using the bluebird card is passed on to the proprietor, 2 dollars per purchase that's a lot. Also guess what else, the proprietor agrees that you get the incentive deals on a number of other transaction with the reward points as well. So leave bluebird alone. Reply Kayla S | February 2, 2016 I love my Bluebird card. It is just like having any American Express card. Some companies don't accept American Express, but you can pull money out of the ATM at most ATM's. I have yet had any huge problems with my Bluebird card. I can add money to it any time which is a problem I had been having with my bank because I worked the branch hours and they blocked my deposit. I have not been blocked at Dollar General or at the Dollar Tree near my home, so it is based on area. Reply Adam | October 20, 2016 Dollar General Does where I live at. Reply Sheryl Saxon | January 19, 2017 I've had the BlueBird card for going on four (4) years now and it's the ONLY card that doesn't charge me ANY fees, responds to all disputes that I've needed to file regarding unhappy purchases, ATM fees at MoneyPass locations, or shady merchants, and offers the benefits that they do. I've been able to use this card not only as a direct deposit for my paycheck, IRS tax refunds, and wire transfers from various institutions, but I have NEVER been told that I'm not able to use it – UNLESS, of course, the retailer themselves do not accept American Express – which there are some who still don't take AMEX because of the higher fees that merchants are required to pay. But, I tell you, a lot of merchants are signing up with Amex and getting with the times. I, personally feel that this card is the best one I've ever had. It outweighs the Account Now, WU NetSpend, and most definitely ANYTHING from Green Dot Bank! American Express Blue Bird and American Express Serve are AWESOME! Reply Scott Howard | November 9, 2012 Regarding transaction fees, I've been told that there are a number of these fees buried in Obama-care (oxymoron). i.e. Everytime you transfer money, use online bill pay, direct deposit, ATM, etc. Mr. Obama will get his piece of our money. Can you you confirm please? Reply robert | November 9, 2012 I thought this nonesense would stop after the election, but ignorance never stops. Obama is on a salary and will get no more or less of the taxpayers money, regardless of whether you get better medical care or not. Yeah, I know you didn't mean that literally, but making it personal the makes losers feel better. Grow up. Reply NR | November 16, 2012 The only "losers" here are the American people. With this un-American, non-American, liar/fool/idiot back in the White House, we'll all be lucky if we don't end up a Socialist Dictatorship within the next four years. Obama-care is an oxymoron and a joke, just like he is, minus the oxy-. And, no, Obama doesn't collect a percentage on any of the fees, unless he has come up with some under-the-table, dishonest way to accomplish that… Hmmm, Obama telling lies and being dishonest, immoral, and otherwise a douchebag… what a novel thought. Anyway, back to the original point, pre-paid cards can be a useful tool in specific situations, but consumers need to be responsible and thoroughly evaluate the people offering them. Reply Franc Willy | December 3, 2012 If Obama is an, "…un-American, non-American, liar/fool/idiot back in the White House…" then what was that maniac, killer of children, war/oil-monger, hypocrite, liar/fool/horse's petute that was in office before him?

They want our Freedom… Period point Blank. Reply Fionna | January 6, 2013 Hey NR, You probably have no concept of how ignorant you sound. Who peed on your cocoa pops. You probably have no concept of what it is like outside of the United States because you have a severely limited view of what it means to be an American. Just because you have the 'right' to say something, doesn't mean that you should. Before you publicly call the leader of your nation a moron, perhaps you should reflect on where you stand on the moronic scale. Do you equal or exceed the President in formal education? Can you claim accomplishments of greater stature than President Obama? I sincerely doubt it… if you had, you would probably understand the concept and benefits of decorum, or at the very least tact. I am not advocating blind acceptance, just the wisdom to recognize the appropriate forum for political debate. Yet, as you opened this line of discussion, I will close my reply to you with the suggestion that you read sections 7 and 8 of the first article to Constitution before offering opinions on public policy and government spending. Anyway, that nonsense aside, I have Bluebird and I have only good things to say about it. It is straightforward and user friendly. I did the research before purchasing and registering an account, but it is not as though I signed a contract or have somehow married myself to Bluebird… it is not a gym membership or cell phone plan, it is prepaid so I chose how much money is loaded on the card. I use it as a checking account, not a savings account. If they change the terms and start adding fees, I will simply not add any more money. No big deal, there will always be another option. I find it preferable to banks and credit unions who charge you for a savings account and then fine you if you don't have money to save. Then, if you close the savings account, they charge you for having a checking account. If something happens and you are tight on funds, they will find a way to take your last dollar and then charge you for not having the minimum balance. It is amazing how quickly they can take a rough month and turn it into a full on financial crisis, and until you pay them, you can't get another bank account thanks to the little black book of bankers: the CHEX system. Reply Robin | January 29, 2013 I agree. I also have a Bluebird and absolutely love it. My son lives about 150 miles from me. I have a subaccount for him. All I have to do is add money to my card and transfer it to his card. It is great for those times when he needs money and i am so far away. Before I would have to wire it and that cost money each time you do it. I love this card and if they ever start adding fees on then I will just stop using the cards. I really don't see a down side to this type of card. It is not like I am going to put my life savings on a card of this nature. Reply James | March 4, 2013 I haven't heard anyone mention that Walmart has it's name on the Bluebird card, yet you cannot transfer any funds from any other Walmart card to the Bluebird card. I'm thinking of Suing Walmart for that very reason. Their name is on it, yet you can't run to a Walmart Store and get any cash from the Bluebird Card unless you either buy something from Walmart and then it's just $100 dollars or use a ATM! I had over $6,000 on my Bluebird card and couldn't get one dime from Walmart. Reply Alan | October 23, 2015 Where do you see Walmart's name on a Bluebird card? You whine that you can't get money off your Bluebird at the register without buying something… what is so difficult about getting money from the Walmart ATM (free of charge)? Good luck with that lawsuit, idiot. Reply Kayla S | February 2, 2016 I use the ATM by the money center in Walmart and can pull out $750 a day. You may be able to up that if necessary by calling American Express. I can not get cash back personally by purchasing a product, so I don't know about that method but just as an FYI Walmart does offer an ATM that you can use free of charge. Reply China Mike | March 14, 2013 Good for you Fiona! Tell that old codger off! Haha. As I see it from your liberal scolding of NR that you too have lived abroad. My eyes were opened in more ways than one being an American living in China. I moved there a mere five weeks after the planes plowed into the Twin Towers and the Pentagon. Very strange times I can assure you. After getting a good world education as to my ignorance from my new found Brit, Australian, German, French and other expat friends, I did a near 360 degree turn-around on my political views and my staunch "Americanism" ideals. Indeed! I doubt most Americans do fully appreciate or comprehend the meaning(s) incorporated into various parts of the Constitution, especially the articles you pointed out regarding Executive Office. (fortunately for me, there were not too many Americans in China to embarrass me further!). I too use the Bluebird card as well as another "Greendot" Visa. Why? Because it unencumbered me from having the rule of law as dictated by many financial institutions (i.e. deciding without my consent to charge me overdraft fees even when I supposedly opted out or, never even given the opportunity to!). Less gov't in my wallet more or less. The longer I was away from the USA, the more I realized how brainwashed the general American public was about contracts! Phones? Insurance? You name it, most Americans have no clue as to their rights and privileges regarding them. When I left in 2001, nearly 95% of Americans using mobile phones were tied to a contract. Abroad, nearly 95% of people from all nations used prepaid service. Why? Because, you pull a chip from your phone when you crossed borders, buy a new chip in new area, plug in, Viola! You're calling again. And banks (in China at least) were incredibly well run (most are open 7 days a week!). So yes, more power to the prepaid services all around. I love, love, LOVE the idea of taking the power away from corporate America any chance I can.

We were founded on Christian ideals and we whooped the British during the revolution because of prayer and humbleness. Fast forward to WWII and you see that we whooped those heathen Nazis, because we were on the side of rightiousness. Everything was good in America as it had always been till the 1960s. Then nonchristians and minorities began pushing drugs and evil on our society. It has pretty much been downhill since. The last GREAT president we had was Ronald Reagan. He was a man that understood right and wrong. Too many Obamy lovers, nonchristians, kids with their pants hanging off their rear, and tree hugging hippie freaks have assaulted this country.

Just go online or to your local Social Security Office to set that up. To many people have issues with our wonderful mail system now with checks being stolen, delivered to the wrong address, tardiness due to weather or holidays or just flat out laziness by the mail carrier who stock pile the mail in his trunk (yes, this has happened in my neck of the woods).

It's not a bank, so it isn't insured as a bank – I get that. What's more, if I'm living hand-to-mouth, the card is only a conduit between my paycheck and my grocery store, and the most that I ever have at risk – and only for a few hours every month – is the equivalent of one paycheck. Furthermore, I don't consider myself entitled to being bailed out if my bank or credit union goes under – the taxpayers who are robbed for that purpose probably are not responsible for the failure, so why should they pay for it? Life is risky, but this is one risk I might be willing to take, not just to avoid bank fees but to preserve my privacy. Reply Realistic | November 14, 2012 I swear Wal-Mart preys on the naivety of people. You have got to be out of your ever-loving mind to walk down this Bluebird road. There are so many banks out there that offer Free accounts if you play by their rules (which isn't that hard). Everybody thinks that banks should handle their money, process checks, provide cash access (ATMs), honor a piece of paper (checks) and give cash without knowing if it is good, have staff to answer questions and insure your money for free. How do you think the staff is paid? Yes money is made on the spread (interest rate) when it is loaned out, but as the nation gets more and more fiscally irresponsible that spread gets smaller and smaller. Oh and also the amount of fraud increases every year a bank must absorb those. I think bank fees suck but I also haven't paid any for years. Know the rules and be responsible and you won't pay any. I wonder how quickly Patriot Act violations will come with Bluebird? I'm not down with this type of prepaid vehicle that will surely support money laundering. This has trouble written all over it!! Reply Peggy | March 2, 2013 I got a Bluebird card, the reason I did was I did not want to put my debit card number on the internet when I saw something I wanted. I was told at Walmart that I could not use Bluebird but once when I tried to put more money on it( I keep very little in Bluebird) also I would have to go online to register to get a permanent card. I went online and they requested information that I was not willing to give. If I would not put my debit card number online why would I put my social security number online. I called Bluebird and they told me I had 2 options; to put my ss # online or not get Bluebird. The agent also told me that she could not register me: I had to do register it online. I will not put my debit card or ss# on internet so I refused the Bluebird card Reply sam | December 5, 2014 Do you know that if obama declares a state of emergency he has a right to take control of all accounts held by banks?

Reply Greg | January 8, 2013 It's because they want to strongarm all their customers into using automated services for payment so that they can cut out customer service jobs, which in their typical white collar arrogance they regard as spending to be cut. As people use the method of payments that don't incur fees, the execs will claim "people don't want to pay in person anymore so we shouldn't staff for it." They'll then lay off all the people who weren't servicing customers not because people didn't want to come in person, but because they were smart enough not to pay more to do it. Companies want to automate everything for the sake of cutting costs but are destroying this country by doing away with every traditional means of earning a paycheck so you HAVE money to pit INTO the economy.

Reply george jefferson | November 16, 2012 Carl, you are correct sir! but at the same time i admit i have had a walmart visa moneycard since i think 2009. if you add/spend $1000 a month, no fees, always $3 to load any amount, i never had a monthly fee because i always have to load and then spend over $1000 a month paying bills but i think its $3. also all the time i get $0.10 to $0.15 off of every gallon of gas i buy. i am like you, i get a paycheck, I CASH IT AT BANK ITS DRAWN OFF OF, get and keep my cash, but lets face it you need access to a credit card now a days for some stuff. i usually load about $300 a month (cost $3) just to use for gas ( at $3.25 a gallon, thats approx. 92 gallons) that saves me $10-$15 a month, its not a huge amount but its something. i guess what i trying to say is people need to balance this stuff. if you use credit cards and you are not a company using it as a revolving credit line to buy inventory every month, you are an idiot! trust me i know, when times were good, i would run up $20,000 to even $60,000 in a couple of months on cards and pay the balance and do it all over again until 2008 when economy collapsed. i had some of those cards for 20 years, not a single late payment, FIRST LATE PAYMENT EVER, rates went from the super low set rates of 2%-7% that i spent years earning, went up to as much as 36%! i believe in cash, carry cash, believe in cash, and most of all believe in a mans word and loyalty. LOL, when the credit card companies refused to help me after I did them right for so many years, i told them flat out, put my rates back to our agreed rate while i sort out my problems are you get not a single dime from me, $0, zip, notta! i guess they didnt believe me, but they learned, and ate about $80,000.00! dumb asses! i am not a dead beat, i told them i would continue paying, never said i would not, but i would not pay more than the rate in our contract! they broke contract, so F!^%#-'em! but these prepaid cards can be helpful and actually if you pick the right one, use it the right way, you can save a few dollars to :) ALL I CAN SAY IS… READ! READ! READ! READ! the fine print on these pre-paids, and good chance you can capitalize on a benefit from one of them that in your certain situation will actually allow you to get one over on these crooks! like me, i use alot of gas, always on the road, i get benefit of access to a visa if a need it and save a few dollars a months, like i said $9-$15 isnt a lot but ide rather be on the recieving end then other way around! Reply Mike in Mt | November 9, 2012 Using cards is a way to take advantage of good online deals when you don't live near major shopping areas. Not ALL of us live in a city or major suburb! Reply Josh | November 16, 2012 I agree with you on that. I can tell that most comments here were written by people who have never endured hardship and have certainly never been poor. There are alot of factors that keep the poor from having an actual bank account, there are credit issues, problems with other bank accounts in the past like unpaid fees, there are minimum balances which are hard for a paycheck to paycheck situation, and a general distrust of banks. Walmart has earned the trust of the poor with their consistent low costs, and Amex is a brand name most poor associate with the rich. Having a prepaid card with alot of the bells and whistles of a checking account is a way to access some of the luxuries and conveniences the higher class takes for.granted, like online bill pay, direct deposit, and deposits with a smart phone. Reply Barb | January 11, 2013 Amen to that. I am one of those with"issues" in the past such as ex-husbands. I'm sorry if I did not spend the money I should not be held responsible regardless if we were still married or not. Gotta love a common law state like that. My current husband also owes back child support (he was out of work for 2 years looking for a job, but they don't care) so they can freeze my account and take the whole amount any time they get an itch. It's happened to me. What they fail to understand is I have bills too. This is the securist way I know of to manage my income and pay my bills without walking around with a bunch of money because that is oh so safe too. I also got one for my daughter who is a single mom. This card allows me to transfer money to her card without having to make a trip to moneygram, get charged an outrageous fee and it is instant. No more worries for me. I like this card risks and all. Reply PT | November 9, 2012 This seems one of the best prepaid card out there. Period. Its not issued by bank, and hence is not FDIC insured but so are most of the prepaid cards. Regarding interchange, arent all the cards living off that? How is Bluebird different than Chase liquid or any other bank's prepaid here? Interchange is not a Bluebird specific feature. Does that mean government should stop the whole business of prepaid cards? This card has one of the lowest fee across the prepaid cards segment. Even Chase liquid, that advertises itself as no hidden cost, one of the lowest fee, etc has ~$4/month fee. For what? Just keeping a card in your wallet!? Bluebird definitely beats that. No monthly fee, no minimum balance requirement, etc Finally, how many cards offer features such as bill pay, subaccounts, etc? So to the critics out there, dont beat the drum just to make sound off it. Look at what are the alternatives in this segment and then analyse a new product.

Personally, your money is safer in a prepaid card. It's 100% backed by YOUR money..it's a law that all prepaid companies must abide by now. 1/9th of your money-my money is really in our respective bank/credit union account…something to think about! Reply Jason | November 9, 2012 The author should do some more fact checking before some of the blanket statements made … Fees: If you go to a reputable prepaid company you will see the fees spelled out, simple and easy to understand. An award winning prepaid company that does this is MangoMoney.com FDIC: There are some prepaid cards that offer FDIC protection – Mango is one of them. It is irresponsible to write that prepaid cards are not FDIC protected. It would be responsible to write that each prepaid vendor has the option to offer FDIC protection – good companies do and bad companies don't. When you don't do your home work it is easy to bash prepaid cards. I hope the author of the article does some work and writes an honest and more articulate recap of prepaid cards – both good and bad.

Supposedly free checking accounts charge up to $33 per overdraft occurrence. By any measure, the BlueBird card is a very reasonably priced products. Yes Amex is making money on the fees paid by accepting merchants. So do all Visa and MasterCard cards. These fees are not paid by cardholders. The absence of FDIC insurance implies that you can't receive your tax refund or other government benefits on a BlueBird card; you would need to pick another card to do so. It does not mean that the card is unsafe. Money Morning News is doing a disservice to its readers by letting so poorly informed articles being published. Reply KENNEDY | March 18, 2014 Yes. You can have your tax refund direct deposited to your bluebird amex card. I have had a bluebird card for over a year and I love it. I also have the checkbook, etc. No min bal and no min deposit amount, and no hidden fees. I have NEVER PAID A FEE. I suggest the author of this article and anyone else giving facts about the card, should GET the card or research it before you give erroneous unsubstantiated statements. The card is wonderful! People are wising up and taking advantage of consumer products that will help with our bottom line. The big banks have been dirty for years and I refuse to have my hard earned money sucked up every month. No thanks! As long as their are alternative products, I'm in. Reply Amanda C | November 11, 2012 The amount of money I will have in this account will only be for bills I cannot pay with cash, which will be a small 'riskable' amount every month. Otherwise, we use cash. We tried a bank account last year and the fees just weren't for us. I'm so glad this has come out. Reply Carrie | November 11, 2012 So whats the pro's and con's of the walmart money card vs. bluebird? Should I countinue to use the walmart money card or should I use the bluebird? I do know I am being charged three dollars to load monies onto the walmart card, and charged three dollars a month fee. What to do? Reply Card Processor Eric | November 12, 2012 Scare tactics do Nothing but harm the Ill-informed and the companies that try to help those whom they serve. The author is an idiot, plain and simple. He or she…. is a strategist, not someone who may speak with authority on money…it's mechanics nor how processing works! Yet the author feels their mind can grasp the understanding of this subject is beyond me let alone baffles me to my core! This is a weak-minded pencil parrot with a bullhorn doesn't know that during the 2008 banking bailout era created a very little-known law pertaining to pre-paid credit card companies. In a nutshell, 100% of your money must be backed with money…ie, you put in your paycheck on a bluebird card, ALL your money is sitting into an account with your name on it! Unlike the banks and credit unions, only 1/9 th of your money is really there. If you put your paycheck of $1,000 in your bank or credit union…only $99.99 must be in the reserves BY LAW! Now..you tell me which is safer?…oh yeah..the FDIC! If a bank or credit union goes under and isn't absorbed by another bank, they do insure you …they can take 30-40 YEARS to repay you! Yes the credit cards come with fees however AMEX fees to the store owner are set in stone. Typical fees on Amex are 2.89% or 3% or 3.5% depending on the type of store you shop in. From what I've seen, some processors rape their clients (store owners) and put them at 4% to 7% for Visa-MasterCard debit/credit fees..and they don't even know it! Yet, the card processor says that AMEX is expensive! WOW, that is bold…but that's how they do it. Let's put this fear tactician to bed…GM took money..still hasn't paid it back. Do you see people driving new cars and trucks? Yep! UPS took bail-out money. I don't know if it's been paid back, but are they delivering packages in the big brown trucks-worldwide? HMMMM! So- shah gilini, author of the aforementioned article..when the adults are speaking, that means you keep Your comments to yourself, also… Take your crayons, construction paper mess and child-safe scissors to your crib and remain in timeout until we decide on an appropriate punishment for Impersonating an adult that knows something about Money and its Mechanics. Reply bug'nout | November 16, 2012 …and stop wearing that disgusting Trump after shave… Reply Card Processor Eric | November 12, 2012 Excuse me, AMEX card fees are lower than what merchants are being charged to debit/credit cards via Visa and MasterCard. Geesh people, since when do you care about store owners? You don't! You only care when you see they can retire comfortably and drive and live in nice things and places! Prepaid card companies are required by law to back dollar for dollar your deposits..the BAILOUT law of 2008! I suggest you read it sometime..oh yeah, you won't because you'll take the author "Shah's" word for it! Banks and credit unions are only required to put 1/9th of the money in their reserve account with the state and federal regulators…hmm genius, that means if they go under, you are screwed. FDIC will pay you back..in about 20-30 years. Yeah, it's insurance Einstein. Not with a prepaid card, your money has your name on it. Amex and walmart will split up the card fees and the monthly fees. Oh yeah…AMEX…Is a bank. Wrap your head around that thought! Reply Card Processor Eric | November 12, 2012 Here is something the author doesn't know… The author doesn't understand processing fees. He doesn't know that AMEX has fees set by industry so all the stores in that SIC code are all charged the same! Ie, all convenience stores are at 3.5% All wholesale are 2.89% and .15 cents So on and so forth… Yet, If the store owner has debit/credit card fees by visa and MasterCard, they may pay anywhere from 1.6% – 16.5%. Yep, I've seen it. Depending on the fees set by guys like me…the processor! Regardless of govt intervention/fees imposed by regulation. Reply Card Processor Eric | November 12, 2012 There are more dirty secrets folks. Just because the Dodd-frank bill was in law with the addition of the Durbin admendment set govt regulated fees with debit cards wasn't geared to help you or me or the store owner, it was another bank bailout put on the Backs of the store owners which In turn..you and I are paying for. Government set debit fees at .21 cents per transaction…but banks left their merchant fees at 1.05% and up…so they lowered the floor so the banks can profit more. Here is an example…$100 charge at the merchant (store) Bank/processor charges (store) $1.05 because that is the rate they are charging True cost to bank.. .21 cents Now..can you see the profit to the bank or processor? .84 cents Yes it is nickel and dime but when you spread this out over several people making swipes several times per day, it really ads up! Have fun pondering this! Reply Robert Palmer | November 12, 2012 excellent site looking forward to the Monday Morning Newsletter!

I have to charge upwards of 20% on some items just to cover bank fees. Bottom line: consumers pay more because they can't handle cash. Our laziness will be the death of us! Reply L Hale | November 13, 2012 This article has a tone of bias against pre-paid card holders being "unbanked". Too bad more research wasn't done to include those of us who use them to purchase/pay bills online. We switched when our local cable company began charging a $2.99 "convenience fee" when we paid cash at the local office (and how this is "convenient" still hasn't dawned on me). Now, if our online identity is compromised, there is no connection to our bank account (which is quite healthy, thank you). I for one will be looking into the Bluebird card. It's clear by your Mission Statement ("Money Morning is here to help investors profit handsomely on this seismic shift in the global economy") is geared towards the exact type of person we, the taxpayers, had to bailout in the not so distant past. And…I might add…the type of person we DID NOT want running this country. Disgraceful. Reply Candace | November 16, 2012 I'm not sure who you're referring to when you say "we" as in the person who we did not want running our country. Please speak for yourself and not the entire nation, because I, for one, voted for our president and I'm glad he's running this country. What would you have done as President when the Real Estate Industry crashed and sent our economy spiraling into a world of hell and a great number of industries were going down in flames and needed government assistance lest they take our economy down completely? What would you have done to promote consumer spending by stimulus in order to inject some life back into our economy? Or better yet what would you have done to help the millions of Americans who lost their jobs and were standing on their last leg barely making it with the peanuts they were receiving from Unemployment? Or how about the school grants that have sent thousands of Americans back to school to learn trades and skills that would take them out of their impoverished states and into a better life and job that would both increase the quality of life and strengthen our economy? What about finally accomplishing something in the "War on Terror" ? We finally got Bin Laden!! Bush was searching for him for how long? And I'm not saying anything negative about Bush, but we as Americans, of ALL backgrounds, have to STOP bashing our President because we don't like the color of his skin or for any reason based off of unfounded and biased opinions of others. Its time to come together to help OUR nation. And that includes everyone IN IT.

Reply Ascension | February 28, 2013 Uh Obamas military machine is now in thirteen countries as the aggressor. Obama is handing fighter jets and Abrams tanks and handheld weapoms of every description to known terrorists, Obama is smuggling arms through turkey into Syria to aid the rebels who also were our enemy in Iraq which led to the death of Stevens and three others including a marine who chose to disregard direct orders from the white house to stand down and not protect Stevens and other Americans (Bengazhi). Obama didn't bail out the corporations the first time around Qe1 Bush did, it failed it shouldn't have been tried again Qe2 and again Qe3. The value of the dollar since Obama took office has been cut in half according to the gold standard, and govt deals and manipulation by the Fed are the only thing keeping hyper-inflation from destroying everything instantly. Gitmo is still open. A massive percentage of violent crime in this country is perpetrated by illegal aliens… Obama is giving them amnesty; therefore Obama is directly responsible for massive numbers of violent crime. Obama sent weapons across the Mexican border to drug cartels, intentional let them walk; resulting in the death of hundreds of Mexicans and several Americans. Obama could create an economic boom in this country instantly by lifting his moratorium on drilling here in the states; and gas prices would plummet as well; disposable income rise and people spend freely; get out of debt; provide for themselves and since they have a job; they pay taxes so we don't have to borrow 6 trillion 6,000,000,000,000.00 from china over the next four years. Bin Laden was killed in 2008 by Seal Team 6 as he left The hospital where his mother was being treated, an American hospital, we knew where he was at all times he. Isiged her at least twice a year during the "man hunt" his death was kept secret so the war would still be funded. Bush was a blow hard ass; but Obama is a communist who is systematically destroying this country. Nothing easiest about anything, he is only half white. I am a conservative black man; and I saw what he was "a socialist Marxist propagandist" from the beginning. He is an anti jobs growth, anti freedom, anti American criminal.

Reply Diana | November 14, 2012 I personally love this card, i automatically have part of my paycheck put on it every payday. The only fee i have was the $5.00 i paid to get the card. There are no fees to down load money if its automatic deposit and you put more than $1000 per month on the card. I do have a seperate checking and savings account, but use this card for automatic pmts and pmts that dont have a revolving same date pmt. This eliminates overdraft costs. you also do not have monthly charges. I also use this card in place of a traditional charge card for car + hotel rental. Its nice to have options with your money and this card allows that. as far as the card noy being insured, you can only have a minimum amt. of money on the card at one time, i think around $1200, so there's not much to lose. its a gamble but worth it.

I have had no problems and have been very happy with the service and features that come along with it. The tone of this article is one of failure. Why? Are you tired of paying outrageous fees at your current credit card company? Are you mad that the bank full of idiots lost some of your money? Was the bank closed and you were unable to access your funds on a Sunday? You almost seem to put down people that use this service like we are bums living paycheck to paycheck. Are you so rich that you have never had to live that way? Well if that's the case good for you, but don't throw this service under the bus like you have in this article. You almost seem excited to see it fail. Quite disturbing to me.

I've actually been nervous about sharing this. I'm talking about the Federal Reserve Board/Bank/House & Senate created and authorized "NSF Fees." It took a long time to come up with the next thought I have to share. Why aren't those "NSF Fees" labeled or named what they really are? Lines of credit, interest rates on short term loans when one of "Wal Mart's paycheck to paycheck customers overdrafts their bank account for a couple of dollars and has to pay an "NSF Fee" ranging from $25-35 give or take a dollar or two. You see I don't understand why an agreement can't be put in place for people like me and plenty of others whereby we will be made to understand that we will as an example, be given a reasonable 2-3 days to deposit that couple of dollars and avoid those horrendously high (6-800% APR) that even loan sharks would be run out of town about. Is anyone getting my drift here? If you extrapolate (is that the right word?) the "NSF Fee" against the $2 overdraft out to an annual rate of interest then who among us that have paid those "fees" wound not be outraged?!! Reply trlinde | December 10, 2012 This basically boils down to two parts. 1st, to eliminate the use of and if possible all together, a cash (or coin) currency. Which brings us to the 2nd part. Card transactions, and card transactions, are traceable. It's just data on the net and once it gets logged it can be traced. Government you say? Well they haven't a clue, it's big business and the consumer marketing firms that want to pigeon hole every one of us into that particular popup add group they have all lined up from the scooter store. Reply Nick | December 10, 2012 Donnie, Is the the gas stations fault. It is typical to place a preauthorization hold on an amount when you first swipe your card. There are formulas that vary by establishment. It a function of the price of gas and the typical amount sold per transaction. So $5.00/gal of gas * average 15 gal tank for a car or 20 gal tank for SUV = $75-$100. The hold falls off automatically after a couple of days or whatever is set by the merchant. Sometimes the merchant will cancel the hold which is very common with large corporate chains like QT. Not the ones that are independent owners or each location. The same thing happens in hotels or rental cars or many other things where the total charge is not know until after the card is swiped. Now important to recognize is that since Bluebird is a stored value / pre-paid card and there is a fixed amount mount available it will follow more or less the same scheme as a debit card. A pre-auth hold will reduce the total available buying power by the amount that is held. This is to prevent over spending the amount avail to the holder. Credit cards by contrast will, depending on the card issuer and agreement, exceed the total credit limit so a hold may not immediately decrease buying power. Hope that helps a bit … standard disclaimers apply. All that said. I love the Bluebird card. No crazy fees to speak of for the cardholder and as a merchant the fees are in line with normal AMEX cards. Of course there are fees for the cardholder but they way they are laid out I am not sure that I will every pay one myself. As far as FDIC insured. No big deal. The structure of both is different and I am just as confident in AMEX as I am in my bank. I can name from memory any number of banks and other saving institutions I have seen fail over the lifetime of AMEX. The one area that does annoy me about Bluebird is the customer service. They should have been more prepared. This is AMEX we are talking about. They know how to execute on this but it seems as if the team put in charge of it was blindsided. They will work it out in the long run but it is disappointing that AMEX didn't take its deep understanding and apply it more effectively. Of course there is also the merchant acceptance of AMEX… get enough people using it and that will sort itself out fast enough. If AMEX is listening I have a couple of ideas for you on this! Reply Tracy | December 10, 2012 I got the bluebird and right after the first time I used it my account was wiped out by some type of fraud. Bluebird canceled my account but I have been on hold for 5 days trying to speak to someone to get this worked out. Meantime Im out of my earned money. I am not to happy with it. Reply Mary A Eleazar | December 12, 2012 i think BLUEBIRD AMEX CHECKING ALTERNATIVE IS FANTASTIC. For those who cannot get credit cards or bank accounts and to have to rely on prepaid credit cards as last resort to banking and saving to pay bills became a huge convenience but with a service charge. and let me tell you they add up. To actually have an AMEX chkg account and all of its features with NO MONTHLY FEES or PURCHASE FEES; NO HIDDEN FEES, is the greatest to me since i have money mgmnt issues. This is definitely a Positive thing that WALMART & AMEX can afford to do. until you own the mobile app and have the card you will just think its just another way for walmart to add to their Walmart Funding sources. Well this time may be but this BLUEBIRD card is amazing and how convenient to add subaccounts to your account that way your not having to use 1 card for certain bills and given the option to add open a subaccount for family members or whomever you wish. I believe this BLUEBIRD AMEX will take over all greendot/prepaid debit cards.Technology is getting smarter so lets follow along!

Some of the other prepay cards are so full of hidden fees they should be banned for usery fees. Sounds to me like you have your own agenda to push and as far as Obama getting a part of the fees, give me a break. As usual big business would have be having a fit because they can't get their grubby little fingers on even more profit for themselves. The greedy are losing their power and blame it on Obama. Get over it the right didn't lose because they are angels but they still don't get that part. Get over it. Reply Lancebekistan | December 12, 2012 Your almost there, but I'll help you out. ALL fees, taxes and everything else are paid by the consumer in the end. Unlike the government who can steal it, the only way any company can pay for anything is by exchanging a good or service for money. You want corporations to pay higher taxes? It's in your loaf of bread… Want "free" checking "free this" or "free that" you pay for it in the cost of other items. The retailers, producers, transporters, marketers and even the janitor crew have to eat. And there is only one way they can get it. But as opposed to taxes at least we get something in exchange for it and have the luxury of the liberty to decide who we want to support…. The traditional credit card fees cost my business more than debit card transactions…. But even if a customer pays by check he is paying a tiny portion of the gross amount of the combined cost of processing sales. Even if you pay in cash at walmart your sale is a greater margin sale for the store, but you are still paying the same fees the store incurs as a result of card processing. Otherwise they would have a different pricing structure for cash sales.

Reply JP | December 17, 2012 Neither Walmart nor American Express are forcing anyone to sign up for their product. I've researched the Blue Bird product, and all of their terms and disclosures are pretty out in the open. I signed up last week for an account. If I want the $250,000 FDIC guarantee, then I would have gone with a traditional bank account. If Walmart and Amex are going after the pay check to pay check customers, then I don't think the lack of this guarantee is going to be an issue. Also, I have to preload your money. If for some reason Amex goes down tomorrow, I will only lose whatever money I had in there… at most, my last paycheck. I used to have an Amex card and a traditional bank account, and I've experienced fraud with both. I can tell you that Amex took off those fraudulant charges much faster than my bank did. By using Blue Bird, you are also getting the Amex fraud protection. Yes, I know that it's frustrating when you have to validate to the credit card companies that you are not using the card fraudulantly, but isn't it nice to know that if your account was in fact compromised by a fraudster that the company has something in place to catch them? As for those forthcoming fees that the author says are coming, those are just their opinion. I can also sit here and say that all banks will be charging montly maintenance fees to their checking and savings accounts in the future, and they may or may not be true. The fact is, Blue Bird does not have those fees today. If they start charging those fees, I will just reevaluate my options at that time. There is no contract that I sign which says I have to keep using this product. I don't think there is much argument on the facts. Blue Bird has significant less fees than traditional bank accounts right now, American Express and Walmart are two of the world's most known companies (for those of you worried about either going under tomorrow), if you change your mind about signing up for Blue Bird, you will just lose the $5 activation fee. Reply Avoid Bluebird!!!!!! | December 17, 2012 I can echo the message above, titled "BLUEBIRD SUCKS". The same thing has happened to me. I cannot get my money! They sell this card at WalMart. When I went to WalMart and tried to make a $17 purchase, they locked my account for "suspicious activity"!!!!!!! AT WALMART!!!!. for $17!!!!. Then you call customer service, where the foreigners with horrible accents tell you that you have to call the "Account Protection Department" so they can unlock it for you. But they don't answer. I spent 4 and a half hours on hold only to be disconnected automatically. It is a scam. They keep your money. And, your money is NOT covered by FDIC insurance. They can just keep it. Warn your friends!!! Reply cheated by another prepaid | December 20, 2012 So far no probs with bluebird. My last card was thru western union. paid room rent of 55 and my reciept showed my balance. I then added another 125 to my catd the same day. made 2 purchaces totalling 24 dollars. b4 bed i checked balance. the next morning i was 55.60 less than the night b4. western union said that it was for a room payment. which means i was overdrawn. thought the purpose of prepaid was to avoid that issue. so am out the money and was treated extremely rudely by everyone that i spoke to. still waiting for corp cust supervisor to call me back. its been 2 days now. thanks western union for leavin me without a place to stay because u dbl charged me for my room. will b transferring my direct deposit to bluebird and gettin rid of ur crappy card and service. will use moneygram for wire transfers from now on. Reply Lost out | December 26, 2012 I am a Gamer and did not want to use my normal bank account for my hobby so i decided to get the blue bird card as an allowance card to keep my spending from getting out of hand. I put $200.00 on the card to start, got home activated it and confirmed emails and all that jaz, excited to try it out i get on the Electronic Arts website and try to buy a game pack, it did not work so i tried a few more time thinking it was me. After about 4 tries i decided to call blue bird and after 30 minutes i got a Indian Lady who told me i had to call the game company so they could run the card manually?? I'm thinking what are they going to do that i could not do online so i call the game company just for the hell and they try to run the card and it fails as well!!! The guys tried it several times and could not get it to work. I waited a few days and went on Steam to see if i could buy a game the same thing i now have a the most expensive piece of plastic in my wallet.. Lost $200.00 and no one can help THIS IS A WARNING don't let this happen to you! Reply Norm | December 27, 2012 Yeah sounds like a scam….hate talking to these operators from India…english is terrible. Reply Erin | December 28, 2012 I'm not here to argue about Obama care, which has nothing to do with the topic of prepaid cards, but I am here to shed light on the banking world. I work for a company who is outsourced by a bank to do their customer service and I can tell you I didn't like banks before, but I really don't like banks now. We make absolutely no money but are required to know more than those who work in the banks themselves. The bank doesn't pay the company I work for, for calls past two minutes and twenty seconds because they believe that's good customer service and expect us to sell their products to their customers as if we are trying to help them and their products are a joke. This particular bank is in the midst of a multi-million dollar law suit because they are raking people over the coals with fees. Now I'm not saying there aren't people who are or aren't irresponsible with their money because there are, but I also know we are in an economic crisis where a lot of people are doing their best and robbing Peter to pay Paul. The fees we charge people to overdraw their accounts and then charge them even more if they can't bring it into a positive balance within three business days is ridiculous. Let me break it down for you: each transaction that takes you into the negative we charge a $37 fee (again per transaction) even if it was just a few cents, then if you are in the negative three business days we charge you what's called a sustained overdraft fee of $6.99 a day from that third business day to the fourteenth business day. You can opt out of being able to overdraw yourself but if a preauthorized debit or a check comes through we hit your account irregardless. So if someone holds onto your check for months and then decides to do something with it we are going to let them then overdraw you and slam you with fees. If a company takes money out of your account for a bill and you don't have the funds available we are going to let them and slam you with fees. If someone gets a hold of your information and you have to call us to file a claim, the claims department has the option to say no we think your lying and not give you your money back. We are supposed to encourage people to have an overdraft line of credit, which we rarely approve people for, charge you $30/yr, 18% interest, and each day that we pull from that line of credit if we approve you is a $10 a day transfer fee plus you pay it back with that 18% interest. Or we are supposed to sell our customers on a savings overdraft protection which means you put money into a savings account and we charge you $30/yr for you to say we can go into your savings and take money from it to cover if you overdraw yourself. Again, I am not saying that there aren't irresponsible people out there because I deal with them everyday. I spend my days getting yelled at by people who can't understand why we charged them fees to go to the liquor store when they didn't have the funds available, but I also talk to people who are struggling to work and take care of families and we are taking advantage of them. I hate my job, but unfortunately I need it. I myself have a prepaid card and I do agree there needs to be more protection available, but after working for this bank I will never deal with one again. I could go on and on as to how the bank screws people over, especially the poor. As far as interest goes, I quote people the interest rates on a variety of different products from IRA's to CD's etc. The interest rates are shit most of the time and not worth having Uncle Sam take what little you are able to earn. I myself prefer to keep as much of the little bit I make. We deal with people thinking they are calling a foreign country all the time and we are in NC. FDIC or not I'd rather keep my money on a prepaid card or in my mattress, especially after being on the inside of such a corrupt system we call the governed banking system. Reply Erin | December 28, 2012 For those of you who have complained and swear that it's Blue Bird that puts a hold on more than what your transaction is I can guarantee you are wrong. Again, I work for a bank and see this everyday. It is up to the merchant how they put a hold and how much they put a hold on of your money. All day everyday I get calls because people see the transaction amount is on hold by a company twice and they think they are being charged twice. When you use any card as credit the money is deducted from your available balance and the typical hold time is 3 business days that the merchant has to claim that money. Once they claim the money for the transaction you will see that extra money they placed on hold or that second, exact amount fall off. So again it is the merchant not the bank or Blue Bird. I also know that we charge people to wire money from their account so I have thoroughly enjoyed using the sub-account on the Blue Bird card. I ordered my daughter one with her name on it so now she doesn't have to deal with money orders or carry cash on her when I want to give her money. I can keep up with her transactions and limit her if I need to but fee free be able to give her money when I want. Working for a bank and having to know more than what branch bankers know but not having their hours or pay is frustrating because people call us customer service reps and treat us like shit all day everyday and as customer service reps we are monitored with each call and are very restricted to what if anything we can do. So next time you call a customer service rep remember they are not the company you are calling they are restricted by the company you are calling and don't deserve to be screamed and cussed at. What people also don't realize is the banks restrict based on a number of things how much you can take out of the ATM daily and restrict you to a certain daily amount for debit/credit purchases as well. If our customers don't meet the criteria then we do not allow them access to their money in excess of what we have set them at daily. As I said in my previous post we have a claims dept as well and if they decide your claim isn't valid as a bank who is supposed to protect you we do not give your money back. I do not agree with the banking system I just need the job. I read everyone's posts about it being Blue Bird etc. but for someone who works for the bank I can guarantee you the banks are worse. Reply sean | December 29, 2012 i have just decided to get the bluebird amex after 1 month of green dot. both are pre paid with very low fee if you use direct deposit-which ill do. the biggest advantage to me is no more overdraft fees and there is no credit-it is like cash. I did bank with td north and chase both of which i liked ,but,did not the the credit card/atm games they played-like im shopping and using my card-i go over my limit- they allow the go-over -and then charge me. td bank actually just lost a large complaint,and,they will be paying 65,000,000 to consumers(like me). i think bluebird is the best out there and with direct deposit the cheapest Reply michael harmon | December 29, 2012 They suck! My accounts locked. The Fraud people who unlock accounts are closed, if they exist. The main customer service number in india is no help. They transfer to bad hold music then hang up on you. Called a number I found here in America, baggage insurance or something, Tim was amazing, he tried his best but failed. I lost hope. They took my money, pretty sure it's gone. Does that give me the right to go rob walmart without getting in trouble? Reply Rich | December 30, 2012 So me being an apparent idiot, got a bluebird card because it seemed like a better deal than the Card I had. They didn't say anything when I signed up or when I was setti up my direct deposit that my SSDI benefits can't be deposited to the card. So now when they try to send them the money, they are going to reject it. I'm confused though because my direct deposit form says American Express Centaurian Bank, wouldn't that imply that they are a bank and have FDIC insurance? Does anyone know what will happen to my check after they send it back? Will I be without my money for weeks? Thanks to anyone who can help. Reply Joe M | January 2, 2013 So, people are supposed to wait until the perfect banking situation arises? Since when has any money loving institution done any of us a favor? We live in a highly imperfect society due to the imperfect behavior of the selfish. Doesn't matter if you are dealing with Walmart or First National Bank. They are all in it for YOUR money. ANd they will get it any way they can. There is only one way to end the madness. Pay a small fee to cash your check. Keep cash on hand. And whenever you need to do an online transaction, then stop in Walmart and get one of those prepaid credit cards and do it. It's cheaper and wiser to not put our faith and trust in ANY of the banking companies. FDIC doesn't mean shit to me. Just a bunch more words written on a piece of paper. Hypocrisy runs extremely deep in $$$society$$$. Reply Bluebird user - Happy so far | January 3, 2013 @Erin – I think I know what bank you work for.. and its the bank I just dumped after nearly ruining Christmas for the second year in a row. What people do not realize is that those of us living paycheck to paycheck can get into a whole mess of fees snowballing on top of each other, only to find that when your direct deposit hits, it's hundreds of dollars less then you are expecting, and going back to living paycheck to paycheck having a few hundred taken from you does nothing but keep the cycle going. Here's how it happened for me this year. Paycheck hits the bank on Friday, I order some gifts from Amazon, and make 5 or 6 other minor purchases (coffee, gas, groceries, etc..), and pay a bill or two, leaving 20 or 30 dollars in the account. Great, all is well, bills are paid and next week will finish up Christmas shopping. Only on Wednesday I check the account, and Amazon's hold + actual charge hit, but because of the timing of everything (or the bank's intentional greed) I get hit with individual fees not for the amazon purchase, but for every small transaction I did that day, other than the one big one. Seven $37 fees. Think about that, 7x$37 = $259, well over half my check. So instead of having $30 I'm now $229 overdrawn. You get that feeling in the pit of your stomach (people in my situation know EXACTLY what I'm talking about.. ) now I can do nothing but wait for my paycheck to hit the bank on Friday, short by $259, short from paying bills, buying food, and making payments on time. Fight them for the fees? Laughable. Good luck getting through to someone who actually wants to help, even then you get a token fee or two refunded which still leaves you financially crippled. The system is designed to keep people like us in the situation we are in. "Well, silly poor man, just don't overdraw your account!", you say! Well that's just a swell idea. I'd love not to, but because merchants and banks have such a backwards agreement going where somehow in a world that I can instantly stream a high definition movie to any computer with internet access they cannot figure out a way to instantly deduct funds from your account. Unless they are deducting fees, those come out right away, somehow they figured that one out. At any rate, because of the "merchants" not taking the money right away, and things like authorization holds being placed on accounts, it's nearly impossible to do business as usual and not pile up fees without a money cushion to fall back on. This didn't happen to me this year though. This time I quickly cancelled my direct deposit and received a paper check. How strange to actually get the amount I earned, and not give a bank their weekly penance for allowing me to do business with them. (I did pay a fee to cash the check at the bank it was drawn on, but $5 was chump change compared to what I had been dealing with). I've since changed my direct deposit to my bluebird card, and will see how it goes. One thing I do know is that I will no longer be subject to the asinine fees changed by banks. I'd rather go down with a sinking bluebird ship and lose at the most one paycheck than keep throwing more and more $$ and the banks. If you're still with me, sorry this post went all over the place, I needed to get all that frustration out. Reply Need to know | January 4, 2013 I desperately need help from anyone who may be able to answer my question….I have been doing a lot of Internet research on reloadable cards. I cannot use a financial institution – bank or credit union. I have seen the negative comments by those who say BlueBird will not allow them to access their money, and yes that does worry me. However, BlueBird seems to have the most features and convenience (as long as they let you have your funds!) Am I able to have my Social Security check AND my husbands Social Security check direct deposited to a card like this, instead of a bank? Does my husband need his own card in his own name to get his check if they will deposit it? I need a way to access my social security and pay my bills without using a bank…is there a limit to the amount of funds you can have on the card? Up to $1500 or 2000 a month? No one at WalMart seems to know. I have appreciated the comments on here and am hoping one of you knows the answer to my questions…….Thanks. Reply Brian | January 5, 2013 I think your reading into this prepaid card option, way to hard. And the facts on this article are wrong. These cards are free for most, monthly service fees are those who do not maintain a certain balance. Reply lynette | January 7, 2013 Why are you folks bashing Obama! The damage was done way before he got into office. I would personally rather pay for health care, programs etc…than wars and other destructive programs. Get real people. That is what government is for, people who can't do for themselves. Like it or not!! Besides this is about prepaid cards, which I think despite their fees they do serve their purpose. Not everyone can or should have a bank account. Let's be real. When everything crashes, and someday it will, no bank or anything will escape the return of Christ. Do the best you can and don't sweat what other people say. Reply Danielle | January 8, 2013 If somebody is going to read a Post/Blog/Article about "Walmart / AMEX Bluebird Cards" I think its a safe ASSUMPTION that those people want to ……..read a Post/Blog/Article about "Walmart / AMEX Bluebird Cards"!!!! If you want to talk about President Bush, President Obama, Obama Care, Spongebob, or Twilight can you PLEASE do everyone a favor and search for a Post/Blog/Article about that particular subject. Really, if you stand by what you say about President Obama regardless if they are negative or positive do you really think you are going to get your view out there by posting a comment in a Walmart Article. Doesn't make much sense does it??? Hey I'm not agreeing or disagreeing with anyone that posted before me all I am saying is that this is OBVIOUSLY NOT THE PLACE TO DO SO! I think the administrators of this website should monitor the comments. Of course you want everyone to be able to express their own true reviews, feelings, thoughts, etc. etc. But, if its comment that has ABSOLUTELY no relation to the topic why not just delete it so that people can read comments that actually refer to the article written. As far as the card… I feel that there are MANY reasons why people choose prepaid cards. But just like with everything in life YOU have to be aware and take the time to fully understand what you are getting into. I have Bluebird myself and personally I love it. It comes with this little book with all the fine print. If you care about what can and might happen to your account or the charges you can and will incur then I suggest you read it. If you don't agree with their program then don't continue to use it. People always complain about a hidden fee that they were charged. But in fact its not hidden its right there if you would have just read the information packet that comes with the card. Its more like… I'm upset that I was charged this fee. I was unaware that I could be charged this. No I didn't read the booklet. But I still feel like I wasn't informed about this. We all have to stop being so damn lazy with life. Until you realize that NO company is going to send you their charge sheet in poster size big/bold print material you are going to have to read what you agree to. Its will only take the same amount of time that you use to call the company, wait on hold, and explain/complain your situation to the CSR over and over again until you get mad and realize its your fault and then hang up. As far as the money not being FDIC insured that really isn't a problem to me. Its a PREPAID card and as long as you use it in that sense it does the job that it intends to do. Honestly anyone who puts 5,000 on a prepaid card (unless you have a specific large purchase that you intend to make within the next few days) would have probably done something equally stupid to lose the money anyways. Its a prepaid card, not a bank card, not a credit card. Its a product, so there will obviously be some kind of charges. If not how would the company make any profit – since its not a bank card. If you want this card to preform as a Prepaid debit Amex card then thats exactly what it will do for you. If you are looking for a regular credit card or traditional debit bank card then don't go with this one being that, thats NOT what it is – Says so right on front of the box. There ARE fees if you care to know what you can/will be charged then read the fees section in the booklet that came with your card. If you don't want to read it then deal with whatever you are charged and only be mad and annoyed with yourself – there is no one ELSE to blame for our OWN ignorance. …. OR to keep this comment simple and straight to the point PROS: Great Prepaid debit AMEX card! Fair fees. Sub accts available for children/others -you hold full control of funds & can review spending patterns. Low $5 start up fee Easy to manage online. Easy to load money to your card. Easy to control purchases by limiting your spending limit according to your budget. CONS: You will not get your own personal Customer Service Rep. No one will call you daily reminding you of your balance. – I think they offer daily text update. No one will call before each transaction is processed to tell you that there is or isn't additional fees associated with that transaction Your hand will not be held. They just expect you to read the service AGREEMENT Reply Ant | February 5, 2013 Well put…thanx!!! Reply jim | January 13, 2013 screw the banks! for one i will never keep a high dollar amount on the prepaid card, and two ill know exactly whats on it at any given time, i never knew when i went to use my bank card/credit card what was going to happen or if it was even going to go through because of fees that they put through without letting you know, for example charter one bank aka citizens bank just settled a 175 million dollar civil action lawsuit because of the way they put through transactions, all just to insure that there will be fees, fees, and more fees. its like giving a perfect stranger your money to hold on to in hopes that he dont take what he wants when he wants for himself. its not fair that they have the right to dip into your money when ever they want, key bank is the only one that i know of that charges just one over draft fee and then freezes your account so that nothing else goes through until it is brought current, thats the way it should be. not oh gee lets see how much money we can screw our customers out of today, let those banks come close to failing, then maybe just maybe they'll wake up and run they're banks like honest and fair people who know how to treat a customer. so i say again screw the banks! Reply Emily | January 26, 2013 SIGH. I came here to get information on the card, and ended up coming across comments that really do not help me at all. I'm a single mom of 2 amazing kids. Not by choice, but I lost my husband. So I'm trying the hardest I can to raise these kids by myself. Any way I can save money, I'll take it. Especially because I'm educated enough to not want to live off the state/government. All I see here is a bunch of repugnant selfish ego comments that really sound horrid. That's not saying ALL of them are. Nonetheless – I'm going to try it. If I get dicked over, I'm blaming Obama Care. Reply Karen | February 1, 2013 Thank you for writing this.

I've experienced problems with this card in lots of stores, where the card wouldn't work. Also, don't even think of getting gas at the pump with this card, you'll be charged a additional 50-100 dollar deposit plus your price of your gas(which they hold till transaction is completed, usually 2 to 3 days). They seem to have security measures on the card that they are not willing to share, because everytime i've had a problem i've had to call them to use the card again. I was using my paypal card before this one, and although I don't like the fees associated with paypal, it's way more reliable of a card than bluebird Reply George | February 7, 2013 Buyer Beware!! Amex Bluebird will only allow you to get cash at ATMs limited to $500 per day so, if you're in a hurry to get say $800 or $1200, well, you're out of luck, you have to do it in two days or more, period. Reply Jef | February 9, 2013 So the BIG old downside here is that Walmart is gonna charge me $1.02 instead of a $1 for my box of candy because they have to raise prices to cover the AMEX IC fees?? And of course, if AMEX goes bankrupt, I love my cash. Yeah…seems like downside enough to make me run out and sign up for the Green Dot $4.95 everytime I breathe card. Bluebird is not a solution, but it is the best stopgap out there right now. Especially for the unbanked, bus riding folk who leave near a Walmart. A lot of Walmart money machine ATMs allow you to withdraw in increments of $1. Reply dmg022 | February 9, 2013 But people say RACISM dont exist.. grow up people really !!

If you don't want a bluebird card don't get one. I have one and have had it since it came out. The reason is that there are very few fees if any. If it gets to the point where the fees start climbing over a level that is higher than a different card then I'll look for another company. In the mean time I'll stick with them. The banks hate prepaid cards because they can't bilk their customers out of more money. It always amazes me how many places people can find to vent their unhappiness and hatred. Use common sense and quit belly aching and life will go a lot smoother. Reply Hannah | February 25, 2013 I got a Bliebird card a few months ago, not putting any money on it for about a month just to see how truly great it might be. I started using it by linking my ebay account to it & the only other reason I keep reloading it is to have the convenience of a card. I hate keeping cash on me because I can't keep track of it that well & I honestly hate breaking bills. I do live paycheck to paycheck & my money is only on the card for a week at most so in my opinion, I'm not risking too much. The only downside (other than the card not being FDIC insured) is that many places where I live in West Virginia don't take American Express anymore. Other than that, I can say I am happy with the Bluebird card. Reply Charles Ballard | February 26, 2013 That is exacly why the GOP loses more and more each year..

To my shock and disbelief BlueBird Amex charged an additional 15% of my 298.71 rental charge grand total 343.52. actual charge for the rental 98.71 plus 200 deposit by Enterprise plus 15% by Bluebird. When I called BlueBird on the reason why the extra 15% charge I was told by their reps that the 15% was a tip that Enterprise charges to all their customers. Which after Enterprise and I stop laughing at the BlueBird reps bold face lie we corrected the rep with the 15% was charge by BlueBird NOT by Enterprise. I did a follow up call regarding the hold placed on my card when after speaking with 5 different reps and got 5 different answers NOTHING was settled Bluebird still has a hold for 244.81 Enterprise has settle my account as they do it's Bluebird when I spoke with Bluebird management I was advise that Bluebird is NOT meant for purchasing Gas (to pay at the pump $50-$100 hold will be place on-top of the actual gas price), Rental Cars (15% additional of your total on hold), or Hotel transactions (20-40% additional of your total on hold). They are meant for daily charges and nothing more but when you speak with Bluebird reps you can use the card for anything you like. My favorite lie from Bluebird depending on whom you talk to will determined when the holds will be release and money put back on your card but except 7 business day hold on transactions listed above but bluebird will say it's the merchant not them placing the hold. Reply Daniel | March 17, 2013 I believe walmart has gained many it's consumers due regular price comparason. Yes, walmart usually has the lowest regular price. However, if the shopper puts in a little effort, the shopper can save a lot of money by shopping elsewhere. There are many department stores that have 25-75% of sales all the time. Put the theory to the test. 1. Make a list of things you want 2. Browse flyers and check off wanted items. 3. Enjoy saving more money. 3. Reply Patti | March 17, 2013 I have a bill that I pay every month and I don't want that company to have access to our regular checking account.

Reply Wayne | July 11, 2013 My experience with American Express Prepaid Cards Is This. You Get Allot Of "Pending" Transactions And The Transactions Are Held For As Long As 30 Days. I Actually Had A Charge From Red Box For $1.61 That Showed In A Pending Status 10 Days After The Transaction Cleared, So American Express Held $1.61 For 14 Days In A Pending Status, They Also Cleared $1.61 So My Account Was Charged $3.22 This Happened Several Times With Different Charges. Also I Went To Purchase Gas, I Has $100.94 On The Card, I Used The Credit Option At The Pump, I Was Allowed To Buy $23.00 In Gas (Filled Up The Car) So That Means I Should Have Had $77.94 Left On The Card. I Then Went To Walgreens, Purchased A Watch Battery For $8.89 I Used The Prepaid Card, To My Suprise There Was Only .94 Available On The American Express Card. So I Looked At My Account Online. American Express Charged My Account $100 For The $23.00 Gas Purchase And Held That In A Pending Transaction For 5 Business Days Before I Got My $77.00 Back. So When The Money Was Credited Back, I Went Out To Dinner, I Tried The Card Again, American Express Put $57.75 In A Pending Status And Declined The Dinner Bill, So Now I Had To Pay Cash For The Dinner Bill And I Am Currently Waiting 10 Days For The $57.75 To Come Out Of A Pending Status, At Which Time I Will Call And Request A Check Be Mailed And The Account Closed. So Be Very Careful With Any American Express Prepaid Cards, They Will Tie Your Money Up For Excessive Amounts Of Time And You Cannot Depend On Your Money Being Available When You Need It.

And besides the first rip off with this is when Walmart hijacked the bluebird.com domain name from the bluebird bus company! Reply Vianey | September 12, 2013 I read today (09/12/13) that the funds are placed in a PASS through FDIC insured bank (see article: https://www.bluebird.com/faqs?linknav=us-Prepaid-Bluebird-Home-FDIC#information-about-fdic-pass-through-insurance) NONETHELESS this doesn't really concern me since I don't plan to use Bluebird as my primary account rather only as a way to "immediately" pay bills via their bill pay feature to creditors (i.e. mortgage, gardener etc.) that I cant pay with a credit card ~ all for the purpose of earning POINTS for travel. Should that feature or the vanilla cards go away then so be it. I'll use it until I can't get POINTS. Reply John Kay | January 15, 2014 My question is why wouldn't this be considered licensed Money services business activity? How are they getting around that pile of laws, rules, regulations? Is it a direct relationship between the 2 companies? Reply Harry Odums | March 14, 2014 Very informative. There is a lot of good infromation and advice here. Reply Randy Lava | March 24, 2014 This is the right blog for anyone who wants to find out about this topic. You realize so much its almost hard to argue with you (not that I actually would want?HaHa). You definitely put a new spin on a topic thats been written about for years. Great stuff, just great! Reply S. Smith | April 25, 2014 I got paid today via direct deposit. I went to the atm and tried to take out some money and it said "transaction declined please try again" so I tried it again and got the same message so I said well let me check my account and see if something (a bill) came through but what I found was bluebird held the 2 transaction even tho the transaction was declined so I contacted them in panic because I have a light bill due tonight which means if its not paid my lights will be off. So I called bluebird and got xferd 4 times and was on the call for a total of 4 hours and 38 min too be told by 1 manager he can give me a temp credit until the dispute team does the investigation so he ask can he put me on hold and I said sure then he hung up so I called back spoke to 2 other managers and they told me he was wrong and he could not give the credit. they said I will have to wait 10-45 days in order to get my money back which is OUTRAGES!!!!!! I will have to sit in the dark with no power worst part of all I work from home so I will be missing a lot of work which is a lot of money and the Rep said when I asked him who will be responsible for the reconnect fees and late payment fees and missed work funds he says oh that's your burden, LIKE SERIOUSLY!!!?? I have referred over 13 people to bluebird and they have referred people 4 of the people I have referred are having the same issue right now and they know its a known issue with there system but they are not caring about the bind they are putting people in by holding up there funds so me and my friends and family will be reporting to the BBB in hopes my funds will be released. I just expected better from the company I have been with for years so I and many others will be taking our business elsewhere.. Reply danie | May 17, 2014 What are you all gripping about I had the Bluebird Card over a year and never paid no Fees. Better than a bank I can transfer money from my kids account instantly I can set aside vacation money. I can go to any ATM and never pay fee. Unless you like paying fees what is the problem absolutely love this card better than a dam bank. Reply howie | November 7, 2014 hey, glad I came across this website.

Reply User of Blue bird | January 3, 2015 Blue bird sucks because in order to receive money from anyone they have to join blue bird. what a waste of time Reply Camilla | January 24, 2015 I've only had my bluebird card 2 months and I really like it so far. I'm using it for the MONEY SAVING CHALLENGE, which I'm getting a kick out of doing. Thanks BLUEBIRD Reply c0d3m4u5 | May 17, 2015 i read all this to see what walmart's "dirty little secret" was behind the bluebird card and this article mentioned nothing about any secret, just stuff that is unrelated to the topic. i've had the bluebird card since its near-beginnings. never paid any fees as long as i followed their small print which is really no small print at all but the same rules with any debit card even from banks. you can withdraw money at atm's for free as long as you go to an in-network atm. you can go to any walmart and add funds, however depending on the walmart, you can also go to some walmarts and withdraw funds for free without buying anything, by going to the customer service desk. i say "some" walmarts because there is a walmart here that would let me withdraw cash and then i went to another and i couldn't. they said they couldn't because their card system machines were different from the other walmart. there really is no loss with the card other than a few inconveniences such as not all merchants accept amex, hunting around for an in-network atm, and running into stupid walmart cashiers who apparently missed bluebird training day and are not familiar with the card so they don't know how to do what you're requesting despite the amex bluebird card rack sitting in their faces. even if you're banked, it's still a good card and i have lots of experience with it since i used it for years as my checking account because i got free checks with it as well. at the time i got mine, i was unbanked and then i paid off a few debts and now i'm banked with my local credit union. however, i loved the card so much, i didn't want to part with it, so i use it for my small business. the only "dirty little secret" about this card is that it IS one of, if not, the best prepaid cards out there. Reply me | May 22, 2015 what the heck does obama have to do with this…..??!!!??? I've deposited money and had no problem. I just wanted to know when they would direct deposit funds …went to this crap about obama and bush and some other bull. Reply Ruthie Derby | June 18, 2015 Do they charge a ridiculously high fee like $16.48 if I allow a company like paypal to transfer it out? Reply Marcus Wellby | June 30, 2015 I'm well aware that this article is old. However, I'm using every opportunity to warn anyone considering an American Express Bluebird Card to think long and hard about the service agreement. I was recently defrauded by American Express Bluebird. They used the guise of declined transaction to removed the available funds from my account. Usually I could just call them and get double transactions removed. However, they made some "internal" system updates about new holds. I was not aware of this new update nor was I notified. Long story short, a triple transaction at the grocery store resulted in $432 being removed from my account. American Express Bluebird is now holding the funds for a total of 8 days, until it clears. They are using the guise of "unavailable funds" declines to commit fraud by pulling the money out and holding it in their custodial account for 8 business days. So, please anyone that believes this card helpful is in for a very rude awakening. Many families cannot afford an 8 day hold on their funds, especially when it is the fault of American Express Bluebird. Oh, when you call customer service, the call is routed to India to people who don't really care about your money problems. Reply Reward Credit Cards Fan | August 22, 2015 Great info. Forgot about AmEx becoming a bank, etc. Thanks! Reply Beth | December 21, 2015 I have never had a problem with this card anywhere. Gas pumps specifically say they will put a hold on your card and its the banks digression when to release the funds. Don't want that problem? go inside the gas station and pay….If you get a release from a vendor the 8 day hold goes away too. I think I had better luck dealing with customer service in India than I have here in America. I really like this card and have had it for years and now my direct deposit gets deposited a day early which I also like. I guess its all in what you are really expecting from this "prepaid" card…. Reply Joseph Ford | July 29, 2016 DO NOT GET THIS CARD had a American Express Pre-Paid Bluebird Card. On 21 Jul 16 I notice an unauthorized transaction for $275 to MADAME TUSSAUDS LONDON ONLINE. I immediately contacted AMEX and the vendor about the fraudulent transaction. I was told by AMEX that I needed to close my card and they will re-issue me a new in 7 days and that when the transaction on my account is no longer on hold I can submit fraudulent claim. So I did, On the 24 Jul 16 informed AMEX the transaction had gone through and I orally filed the complaint, on 27 Jul 16 I received an email from AMEX with a declaration of fraud form, which I filled out and return the same day. On the 27th called to AMEX to see if my call would be here the next day and I was told no it was 7 to 10 Business days. On 29 Jul 16 I received four emails from AMEX. One telling me that my claim had been denied, another tell me my account was empty a day after my direct deposit paycheck had arrived, and my son account had been closed, then my account had been suspended. I called AMEX customer support immediately and after 2.5 hours on the phone, told that to account just shows closed and the disputed did not go in my favor, plus all the funds(which was all I had) left in the account will be sent to me by check and should arrived in 10 to 15 business days. I had this card for over 4 years and now I am left without funds to pay any bills, pay rent or to buy gas or food till next payday. I was told by AMEX the only thing left for me to do is to write a letter AMEX general mailbox…yes I am serious…. The customer service is some of the worst I have ever had, they are reading straight from a script and have no power to help you. Reply Leave a Reply Click here to cancel reply.

The competition between traditional retail players and Amazon.com Inc. extends beyond market share and sales. Retailers like Macy’s Inc. M, -2.71% which have a long history in bricks-and-mortar, are also competing for the tech talent they need to turn their businesses into the multiplatform, ease-of-use, e-commerce-enabled selling machines that customers want to buy from. But experts say traditional retailers have a perception problem. The talent they need—forward-thinking, tech-savvy, highly-skilled—are more apt to look to companies like Alphabet Inc. GOOG, -1.06% or, yes, Amazon AMZN, -0.40% as employers, rather than turn to retail for job opportunities. See also: Amazon is going to kill more American jobs than China did “Their legacy is traditional retailing, which isn’t friendly to technology,” said Christian Magoon, chief executive of Amplify Investments, the company behind a number of ETFs, including the Amplify Online Retail ETF IBUY, +0.17%  . “There’s a cultural revolution that’s going to have to happen in retail.” According to Gerry McNamara, global managing director of the information officers practice at Korn Ferry, a talent search firm, companies like Amazon are going to colleges and even high schools to start the process of convincing prospective staffers to join the team. Retailers could be a bit late in making their pitch to prospects. Retailers are also dealing with business processes that are hard to transform quickly. “They have to deal with legacy systems that are tried and true and are now being threatened by new forces,” said McNamara. “They have to digitize systems but can’t scuttle the old business.” Traditional retailers know the importance of technology to their companies. On Wednesday, Target Corp. TGT, -0.73% announced that same-store sales during the November and December holiday period fell 1.3% and total sales fell 4.9%. But December digital sales were up more than 40%. On Thursday, Goldman Sachs downgraded Target shares to sell, in large part, due to the competition with Amazon. Amazon Plans to Create 100,000 Jobs, and More(16:59) Amazon says it plans to add more than 100,000 full-time jobs in the U.S. over the next 18 months. Plus, the GOP-controlled Senate cleared a hurdle Thursday to begin their plans to repeal Obamacare. Photo: Getty And Wal-Mart Stores Inc. WMT, -1.60% which in the last year has purchased Jet.com and restructured its technology leadership, among other digital moves, said this week that e-commerce services will be a hiring focus as the company adds about 10,000 retail jobs in the coming year. Careers website Glassdoor’s report “Looking Ahead: 5 Jobs Trends to Watch in 2017” highlights Wal-Mart, saying the company’s “Silicon Valley research facility aimed at attracting machine-learning experts to help automate pricing and logistics” makes it one of the “major tech employers today.” But convincing potential employees, particularly scarce tech workers, that they should bring their skills to the retail industry is a hurdle. Only 9% of the 1,005 students polled for Accenture Strategy’s 2016 U.S. College Graduate Employment Study who are entering the job market said they would most like to work in the retail industry. Moreover, according to Eric Shea, managing director at Kurt Salmon, which is part of Accenture Strategy, many are looking to “do good” in areas like education and health care. See also: Is Amazon’s new credit card for Prime members worth it? Shea sees the problem as twofold for traditional retailers: they need store workers who can handle inventory management systems that are increasingly digital, and they need engineers and other core tech workers. The first step to attracting these staffers is customer experience. “If they show an innovative customer experience in e-commerce, mobile and in-store, they would be better perceived,” said Shea. Compensation and other incentives are an issue also. “You have to make it feel like a startup with some upside,” said Stefan Weitz, chief strategy officer at Radial, a retail technology provider. Weitz worked at Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +2.35% for 17 years. He says things like rewards for hitting a milestone, or changes that involve the company’s environment can make a position more enticing. Top-notch executives, like a capable chief information officer, are valuable too. See also: Amazon’s dominance shows up in the jobs report “You have to be savvy enough to know how all the pieces fit together to build an efficient organization and the customer experience that’s great as well,” said Shea. But a major retailer will need more than one person in this area. Many, especially large ones with complex operations and supply chains, are hiring companies to meet their needs or acquiring them outright. “We’re going to increasingly see more mergers and acquisitions,” said Amplify’s Magoon. “Traditionals will eventually have to buy the talent or buy the business model. I’m skeptical that they‘re going to be able to invent it in their current legacy organizations because the people at the top have been in that model for 20 or 30 years and change is hard.” The SPDR S&P Retail exchange-traded fund XRT, -1.34%  closed Friday down 0.2%, and has gained 7.6% in the last 12 months, underperforming the S&P 500 SPX, -0.09%  , which is up 19.1%.

(REUTERS/Rebecca Cook)    4443001 Video footage taken from a Florida Wal-Mart shows a shopper literally jumping the gun. The surveillance footage, released by the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office on Wednesday, shows Michael Foster, 43, tackling Clarence Daniels from behind as he was walking into a Brandon, Fla. Wal-Mart on Tuesday. Foster followed Daniels into the store after seeing him exiting his vehicle with a gun holstered under his shirt — which was perfectly legal for the 62-year-old Daniels to do since he holds a concealed weapon license. Nevertheless, Foster tackled Daniels from behind as he entered the store, and put him in a chokehold before taking him to the ground. Witnesses said that Foster yelled out that Daniels had a gun. They also said that Daniels yelled out that he had a license for it. Foster called 911 only after he tackled accosted Daniels. He was arrested and charged with battery.

Early in his first press conference as president-elect, Donald Trump said he would make pharmaceutical companies bid for U.S. business because they were “getting away with murder” on drug prices. Indexes that track pharmaceutical stocks plummeted. It was classic Trump, doing what economists call “jawboning,” or moving markets today with threats of action in the future.  Presidents and Federal Reserve chairs have jawboned before, usually from behind a podium or in a carefully crafted statement. But when Trump wants to cut the cost of the next version of Air Force One or stop companies from sending jobs overseas, he bullies, intimidates and threatens via Twitter. His policies change by the week, but it’s clear they won’t fit any classic economic mold. What’s less certain is whether this ad-hoc approach will yield the results Trump advertises. Here are some basics of Trumponomics: Employment Like other Republicans, Trump sometimes talks about how economic growth creates jobs. More often, however, he talks as if there is a fixed sum of jobs in the world. Jobs are “taken” by other countries, to be taken back through negotiation. When he cajoles companies to drop plans to invest in factories abroad, he uses a classic European approach known as dirigisme, which elevates the state’s interests over those of employers or free-market forces to influence corporate investment. Here, jawboning has created results, albeit minuscule in an economy that employs 152 million people and regularly creates more than 150,000 new jobs a month. Since the election, Fiat Chrysler, Wal-Mart, Lockheed Martin, Sprint and a half-dozen other large employers have pledged to hire more than 200,000 new workers. Critics say those numbers are illusory because companies are repackaging existing plans into something Trump can claim credit for as a way of currying favor. Read more: Trump-Friendly Job Boasts Don’t Quite Add Up for GM, Wal-Mart Read more: Trumponomics Is Scarier When You Actually Study It Trade  Trump is a protectionist on trade, notwithstanding his advisers’ disclaimers. On his first full weekday in office, he withdrew the U.S. from the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership that President Barack Obama had spent years negotiating. (Free-trade talks with the European Union are likely to meet the same fate, yet Trump aides say he is open to a two-way trade deal with the U.K.) The next day, Trump met with Detroit auto executives to repeat his threat to impose 35 percent tariffs on goods they send from plants in Mexico to the U.S. Trump also reversed Obama by agreeing to open negotiations over construction of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines -- and insisting that developers use American-made steel. He has called the North American Free Trade Agreement the “single worst trade deal ever approved in this country” and invited the leaders of Mexico and Canada to cut a new pact with him. He wants to confront China more forcefully within the World Trade Organization. Trump has also said he would instruct his Treasury secretary to declare that China manipulates its currency to sell products more cheaply to the U.S. China so far seems impervious to jawboning; it has yet to respond with any concessions. Read more: Why Trump’s ‘Big Border Tax’ Gets Taken Seriously: QuickTake Q&A Read more: Free Trade and Its Foes Fiscal Policy The new president says he wants to preserve Social Security and Medicare benefits, which aligns him more with Democrats than Republicans on entitlements. He is also wildly out of step with his party’s fiscal hawks in calling for investment of as much as $1 trillion to revitalize public works, a classic liberal approach to governing and one way to reward the blue-collar workers who helped elect him. He sometimes says he will borrow money to do this while interest rates are low. His advisers say it could be done through tax credits. Trump hews to the Republican standard of lowering taxes to stimulate growth. His plan calls for individual and corporate tax cuts that critics say would balloon the deficit by at least $4 trillion and as much as $6 trillion over 10 years. To pay for the cuts, Trump has said that, like congressional Republicans, he prefers “dynamic scoring,” a wonky way of saying tax cuts will create economic growth, increase tax revenue and make spending cuts unnecessary. Trump would also assume increased tax revenue from regulatory cutbacks -- a move without precedent in government budgeting.

He accused Fed Chair Janet Yellen of keeping interest rates “artificially low” to improve Obama’s record on jobs. Trump’s views seem influenced by his personal experience as a real-estate developer. Under Yellen, the Fed has come around to the idea that the natural rate of interest – what the rate would be, without any policy intervention – is much lower than it has been historically, and perhaps even below zero. Trump seems to think rates should resemble what he generally paid to borrow in the 1980s and 1990s, and it wasn’t close to zero. At times, Trump shows libertarian instincts on monetary policy by supporting legislation to reduce the central bank’s independence with regular audits of policy deliberations.

On Jan. 24, he signed an order to expedite environmental reviews on high-priority construction projects. He promises to roll back the Dodd-Frank Act on financial reform, the Affordable Care Act and Obama’s clean power plan. He has said he would abandon U.S. commitments under the 195-nation Paris climate-change accord. He has also said he would preserve rules that protect health and safety. He doesn’t seem to share others’ worries that deregulation could worsen climate change or invite another financial crisis. Deregulation fits his understanding of how economic growth is created: Businesses create jobs; by lowering taxes and cutting regulations, businesses will create more jobs. Since the election, some companies that have publicized new jobs have cited the promise of lower regulation under Trump -- a classic jawboning result.

Government debt experts expressed alarm, with former Obama Treasury official Brad Setser calling Trump’s comments "lots of very loose talk on a subject where there shouldn’t be loose talk." Though he often refinanced the debt on his own projects and forced creditors to take losses, doing so with U.S. debt would be difficult. It would involve issuing new bonds, most likely at higher interest rates, which would offset any gains from buying back old debt. It could also place the U.S.’s credit rating and its standing with investors at risk.

You will now receive the Game Plan newsletter Between Trump’s election and his inauguration, the U.S. dollar rose almost 5 percent against a basket of 10 major currencies. It was sent aloft by expectations that he’d cut corporate taxes, spend big money on infrastructure and ditch dozens of regulations. But the surging dollar clashes with Trump’s other pledge to create millions of new jobs by reviving U.S. manufacturing. To do that, he needs the dollar to weaken to help exporters sell more of their goods abroad. In Trumpian fashion, he sought to jawbone the dollar down in a Wall Street Journal interview just before his inauguration, when he pronounced the dollar as “too strong.” The dollar duly lost some of its value, but that could be temporary. If Trump heats up the economy with tax cuts and government spending, as he promises, the Fed may need to raise interest rates more aggressively than planned, attracting more dollar investors and driving the greenback ever higher. Even Trump can’t jawbone capital back across the border, which is why presidents try to avoid talking about the currency.   Read more: Strong Dollar as Article of Faith Questioned by Trump The Reference Shelf A Moody’s Analytics paper assessing the economic effects of Trump’s policies.

By Stephen Feller   |   Updated Jan. 20, 2017 at 6:40 AM Follow @upi Comments Jan. 19 (UPI) -- The man accused of killing an Orlando police officer who was attempting to arrest him on charges he'd killed his pregnant ex-girlfriend said police are lying about both amidst a profanity-laced tirade in court on Thursday. Markeith Loyd was officially charged in the shooting death of Orlando Police Department Lt. Debra Clayton on Thursday, bringing the number of charges he faces in connection with the crimes to 10. Loyd was arrested Tuesday after a nine-day manhunt following his alleged "execution-style" shooting of Clayton outside a Walmart when she approached him on Jan. 9. At the time, he was wanted for the shooting death of his pregnant ex-girlfriend, Sade Dixon, and the injury to her brother who tried to help. Loyd appeared in court with a bandaged eye and bruised face, accusing police of beating him when he was apprehended on Tuesday, denying accusations from police that he resisted arrest. After the court appearance, police released overhead video footage of his arrest to counter the charges that they indiscriminately beat him. In court Thursday, Loyd told a judge someone else killed Dixon on Dec. 9, a crime for which he was facing five charges when Clayton spotted him outside of the Walmart. He shot Clayton once, and after she fell to the ground, he stood over her, continuing to shoot "execution-style," OPD Chief John Mina said. Loyd allegedly carjacked someone in the Walmart parking lot in order to escape the scene. He was eventually tracked to an apartment complex where he got into a shootout with police -- one of whom he shot at, but did not hit. During his court appearance, Loyd said police are lying about what happened at Walmart, as well as who killed Dixon, and declined a public defender because he wants to represent himself. When the judge at the Orange County Jail ruled him to be held without bond, Loyd closed out his appearance in court by cursing the judge out. He is expected back in court Friday in relation to the new charges, which include murder of a law enforcement officer, attempted first-degree murder with a firearm, armed carjacking, wearing a bulletproof vest while committing a felony and aggravated assault.

China's economy finished a tumultuous 2016 on a positive note as consumers stepped up spending and the property market rebounded. China's gross domestic product (GDP) grew 6.8 percent on-year in the fourth quarter, slightly beating expectations and signalling growth was stabilizing. The world's second-largest economy had been forecast to grow 6.7 percent in the quarter, according to a Reuters poll of 42 economists. For the full year, China's economy grew 6.7 percent. That was in line with estimates from the head of China's state planning agency, who said on January 10 that the economy likely grew around 6.7 percent last year, Reuters reported. China's statistics bureau said that consumption accounted for 64.6 percent of GDP in 2016, while per capital consumption rose 8.9 percent on year to 17,111 yuan ($2,490). Property development also contributed to growth, with total investment rising 6.9 percent for the year, up 5.9 percentage points from 2015. show chapters China had a better year than people expected: Blackrock    Thursday, 19 Jan 2017 | 9:14 PM ET | 01:43 This may be China's slowest pace of growth in 26 years, but it remains within the range for Beijing to meet its longer-term goal of doubling GDP and per capita income by 2020 from 2010 levels. Helen Zhu, head of China equities at Blackrock, told CNBC's "Street Signs" on Friday that it was a "solid set" of numbers, especially compared with "strong doubts" about the economy a year ago. "The property sector, the auto sector are quite buoyant for the year on the back of some loosening. I think those are all positive surprises in 2016. All in all, a much better year than people had previously anticipated," she said. The figures likely signalled that China's economic growth is starting to stabilize amid the country's transition toward domestic consumption and away from manufacturing- and investment-led growth. Concerns have persisted over the mainland economy's health, as private-sector debt has surged even as the amount of growth from additional debt has declined. But the economy in recent months has received a fillip from a pickup in the property sector. Additionally, reforms aimed at pruning sectors with too much capacity have been bearing fruit, helping to contribute to a pickup. China was set to announce a lower economic growth target for 2017 to around 6.5 percent, from last year's range of 6.5 to 6.7 percent, Reuters reported, citing people familiar with the matter. Zhu said she expected the economy would decelerate this year, but she didn't consider that a problem. "A few years ago, the market would have been very worried about this and thinking it was a very negative thing. I think throughout time, people have seen that structural reforms and the quality of growth is much more important than just the pure quantity of growth," she said. show chapters China growth momentum has improved: Economist    Thursday, 19 Jan 2017 | 6:08 PM ET | 01:55 Other analysts have pointed toward the recovery on the mainland. "Growth momentum in China has actually improved a little bit in the second half of the year, led by the improvement in the industrial sectors and also the financial market recovery [in] year-on-year growth terms," Li Wei, a China economist at CBA, told CNBC's "The Rundown" on Friday before the data's release. "We think China's economy has entered this year, 2017, on a firmer footing." But he noted that China's economic performance this year would depend on the global recovery, particularly whether the mainland's exports pick up. He estimated that declining exports had shaved 0.5 percentage point from China's GDP growth in 2016. If exports to the EU and U.S. recover, that would turn "flat," and China's 2017 economic growth could pick up to around 6.8 percent, Li said. Other data released on Friday also appeared to paint a less gloomy picture of the economy. China's retail sales for December rose 10.9 percent on-year, slightly ahead of a Reuters poll forecasting 10.7 percent. Industrial output for December rose 6.0 percent on-year, a tad below a Reuters poll forecast for 6.1 percent. But in what may be a worrying trend, fixed-asset investment remained a dim spot. For the full year, fixed-asset investment rose 8.1 percent, slightly below a Reuters poll forecast for 8.3 percent, with Reuters noting that was the slowest pace of growth since 1999, during the Asian financial crisis. That came as policymakers were working to stem capital outflows. Earlier this month, China reported that its foreign exchange reserves fell for a sixth straight month in December, declining by $41 billion for the month, to $3.011 trillion, the lowest since early 2011. Policymakers have shored capital controls in an effort to stem outflows. But in a note published Friday, analysts at HSBC said that was only a temporary solution, with the outflows merely a symptom of larger problems. "We believe that weak domestic investment and rising capital outflows is a reflection of declining business confidence in the domestic economy," HSBC said. HSBC advocated policymakers pursue a coordinated package of tax cuts as well as faster reforms of state-owned enterprises to offer the private sector more opportunities. —Aza Wee Sile contributed to this article. —By CNBC.Com's Leslie Shaffer; Follow her on Twitter @LeslieShaffer1 Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook.

Markeith Loyd, 41, was arrested in Orlando on Tuesday night when he crawled from an abandoned home where he had been hiding following a nine-day manhunt. He is accused of shooting dead Orlando Lt. Debra Clayton on January 9 outside a Walmart as she tried to apprehend him over the murder of his pregnant ex-girlfriend Sade Dixon on December 13. Police said Loyd resisted arrest on Tuesday and that force was used to bring him. Loyd, who was hospitalized due to injuries sustained in his arrest, was pictured in his mugshot with a battered face and a bandage over his eye. Police helicopter footage shows Loyd crawling from the home on his stomach before officers surround him and appear to kick him in the head several times. Orlando Police Chief John Mina said a use of force investigation is underway over the arrest. He said Loyd was wearing body armor at the time and officers were concerned he could have been hiding something inside. Scroll down for video  Police released aerial footage of the moment Loyd was arrested on Tuesday, which appears to show officers kicking him as he laid on the ground He was pictured lying face-down on the road as officers surrounded him. Police said Loyd resisted arrest on Tuesday and that force was used to bring him Mina said Loyd resisted arrest by not putting his hands behind his back. He added that they found a large bag of ammunition beneath him. Loyd appeared with his eye bandaged and flanked by two police officers in an Orlando courtroom on Thursday to face the charges where he screamed 'f*** you' at the judge. 'They done took my eye, broke my nose, broke my jaw,' Loyd complained, swearing as he described crawling out to the road to be arrested. He claims he didn't resist arrest. 'I crawled out to the mother*****g road, so how did I resist?' he said. 'I didn't resist s***. They just did that s*** and tried to hide it from the news people, but I'm here right now.' Loyd has been charged with first-degree murder and the unlawful killing of an unborn child in the December 13 death of ex-girlfriend Sade Dixon. He is also accused of fatally shooting the cop but has not yet been charged. Markeith Loyd, suspected of fatally shooting an Orlando police officer, attends his initial court appearance Thursday wearing an anti-suicide smoke Loyd spoke out of turn and told the judge 'F*** you!' during the appearance on charges of killing his pregnant ex-girlfriend He declared that many of the accusations against him are 'made up' and complained that he was roughed up during his arrest   Most suspects appear with a lawyer and remain silent while the judge reads the charges in these initial hearings. But Loyd said he planned to represent himself, and stridently disputed the charges.  'First of all, I got questions to ask,' he said before launching into the rant. The judge told him: 'You're here for first appearances on a warrant, sir.' 'Y'all making up s***,' Loyd said. 'Like I just went in there and shot this girl. Y'all portray this s*** to the news people like I just went in and shot this girl.' 'Other guns were found on the scene. A gun was pulled on me first,' he claimed.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Captured alive: Bloodied Orlando 'cop killer' who 'murdered'... Chick-Fil-A honors fallen Orlando cop who was a regular...

Share this article Share 990 shares Local television stations showed Loyd with a bloodied face when a half-dozen officers and deputies took him into police headquarters on Tuesday.  He told a crowd that authorities had 'beat him up'. Loyd was hospitalized until Wednesday night before he was jailed.  'I believe that our entire community is going to breathe a sigh of relief at this point,' Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said after Loyd was taken into custody. 'They will sleep better knowing tonight that...this maniac is off the streets.' Police said that Loyd (pictured Tuesday) resisted arrest and force was used to bring him in Loyd (left in his mugshot) is accused of fatally shooting Orlando Lt. Debra Clayton (right) on January 9 outside a Walmart while he was a fugitive from justice Loyd is also charged with the murder of his pregnant ex-girlfriend Sade Dixon (pictured) Orange County Judge Jeanette Bigney ordered Loyd held without bond. In court, Loyd dismissed any notion of guilt in Dixon's death. 'Her little brother got dropped off while me and her were standing there talking. There was all other kinds of s*** that happened,' he said. The judge cautioned him several times that the hearing wasn't the forum for such an outburst, but he continued anyway. Bigney then confirmed that Loyd was speaking under oath, and said 'everything you say is being recorded, sir.' 'I'm not finished talking because y'all been making up s*** the whole time,' Loyd responded. 'And then y'all make stuff about my family, lock them up.' He went on to speak in defense of three people who were arrested as accomplices for allegedly helping him evade arrest — and placed himself at the Walmart store where the officer was shot.   'I received nothing from nobody. I went to Walmart myself to buy food nobody was doing nothing for me,' he said.  'Wasn't nobody doing nothing for me.' At that point, the judge interrupted him. 'Sir, we are here addressing only one case.' Law enforcement said that authorities surrounded a house at 1157 Lescot Lane in Metro West Orlando and ordered Loyd to surrender Tuesday just before 7pm Video of Loyd being brought out of police headquarters emerged showing his bloodied face Police say Loyd was armed with these two weapons, one of which has a 100-round capacity, when he was apprehended Tuesday evening A second law enforcement officer, Orange County Sheriff's Deputy First Class Norman Lewis (pictured), was killed in a motorcycle crash after joining the massive manhunt A boot lies on Pine Hills Road on Monday after Lewis, an 11-year veteran, was struck by a van while responding to the manhunt for Loyd Police officers carry Lt Debra Clayton's casket on Saturday during her funeral  Loyd was wanted in connection for the murder of Dixon and allegedly shot Clayton when she received a tip that he was at the Walmart parking lot and approached him.  After the officer's shooting, police arrested three people for aiding Loyd in escaping capture after allegedly killing Dixon on December 13. Another officer, Deputy Norman Lewis, was killed in a motorcycle accident when he joined in the manhunt for Loyd.  Loyd was seen being escorted out of the Orlando Police Department on Tuesday extremely bloodied, with bandages covered his eyes, head, and left cheek. Mina said Clayton, 42, was a 'committed' officer and 'a hero' who gave her life to the community she loves. 'To put her handcuffs on the bad guy that she was trying to catch when she was killed was significant and meaningful to her family, its meaningful to her OPD family as well,' he said.   She was married and had a college-aged son. She also grew up in the Orlando area, and enjoyed mentoring young people.       Read more: Manhunt ends: Markeith Loyd taken from ORMC to jail Share or comment on this article e-mail 990 shares Most watched News videos Pizza Hut customer finds workers in the back of empty restaurant in Bristol Graphic: NZ Breakers player's eye dislodged in horrific injury Shocking CCTV shows car speed into Humber Bridge barrier Heartwarming scene as Grayce shares her puppies with owner A close look at the huge crack formed across Arizona desert 'There goes that relationship' Trump's quip to BBC question Florida couple passed out in their car with two children in the backseat Trump calls Islamic State 'sneaky, dirty rats' during Hannity interview Enraged man punches laptop and quits job during 'meltdown' at airport Alarming moment guy violently pushes man onto tube tracks CCTV shows brave man fighting nunchuck-wielding robbers Bizarre footage of multiple UFOs hovering near Mexican border Settling in nicely!

They are believed to be the first from any retailer in the U.S. Drone delivery already available in the United Kingdom is still a novelty in the United States as more stringent federal regulations have kept it in a testing phase by retailers like Walmart and Amazon. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos has expressed frustrations with the slow pace of the Federal Aviation Authority. Amazon applied for a permit to fly drones in the U.S. in 2014. But then the company said it took a year it to get the testing permit and in the meantime it turned its sights to the United Kingdom, where it recently completed a drone delivery. The online retailer said the permit it received in the U.K. allows it to fly drones in some rural areas and suburban areas in the U.K., allowing the company to test more freely. Annibal Sodero, assistant professor of supply chain analytics at the University of Arkansas, recently told Talk Business & Politics the U.K. is a good testing ground for Amazon to work out any kinks and gain proficiency in drone delivery so that when and if the FAA relaxes the rules they can have a first mover advantage in the U.S. The FAA has issued nearly 300 commercial drone flight waivers to retailers, cities, restaurants, other businesses and logistics companies such as United Parcel Service. UPS also recently reported it used drone technology to make a medical drop to Martha’s Vineyard, Mass. Wal-Mart continues to test the use of drones in its stores and warehouses but has not yet used the technology for customer deliveries. As drone permits continue to escalate in the U.S., it’s just a matter of time before consumers will likely have that delivery option in some areas of the country. Fayetteville-based Field Agent recently conducted a poll to gather consumer attitudes about drone delivery. The survey of more than 2,000 consumers, ages 18 to 65 indicate a wide acceptance of the emerging delivery technology. Half of the respondents were men and the geographic location of the respondents were split between smaller populated areas below 50,000 (39%) to median-size areas up to 500,000 people (39%), and very large areas with more than 500,000 people (22%). Over half (54%) said drone delivery was extremely or very appealing, about one-third said it’s moderately appealing and the remaining 16% were really not very interested. Drone delivery can be used for a wide range of products but the two reasons the majority of consumers would like to see delivery is sending gifts to others (57%) and delivering hot, ready-to-eat meals to themselves (56%). Half of the respondents see the drones as good delivery service for entertainment such as books and DVDs. There also is the niche use for medical and health products which is important to an aging population according to 48% of the respondents. Snacks and groceries were also popular choices for drone delivery by about 45% of those surveyed. Apparel and electronic accessories were choices by 41% of the respondents. Fresh groceries were not as popular with 36% citing that. Baby supplies and beauty products were less popular at 22% and 29%, respectively. Consumers see drone delivery as a way to get items faster, as 75% of the respondents expect delivery within one hour or less, But 44% want it faster in 30 minutes or less. Despite wanting the fast service, consumers aren’t willing to pay much for it. When asked what the highest fee they would accept for delivery of merchandise for items valued at $5, $20 and $100, consumers were willing to pay a larger percentage for the cheapest order. The most commonly used response for the $5 order was $1 which is a 20% overall cost increase. For the $20 order the mode answer was $5 equal to a 25% cost increase. But for the most expensive item of $100, consumers would most likely pay $10, which is just a 10% cost increase. In fact, 58% of the consumers surveyed expressed concerns over the price for the drone delivery. While cost matters, 63% of consumers said the safety of the packages was their biggest concern. Over half the consumers were also concerned with technological malfunctions, shipping mistakes, human interference and package condition. Just under half the respondents see potential issues with weather, limited carrying capacity, privacy, general safety and interference with air traffic. Consumers, according to survey results, believe drone delivery could have significant benefits for faster delivery, serving shut-ins, urgent non-medical products, relieving traffic congestion and assisting with health emergencies. While many retailers have permits to test the technology, consumers were asked which ones they believe will offer it as a delivery option in the future. Overwhelmingly, 82% cite Amazon, while 65% believe Wal-Mart will also figure out how to use it. Target was third at 59% and 7-Eleven, the first to do it the U.S. only, garnered 15%. Domino’s, McDonald’s and Chipotle were the three restaurants cited in the report by consumers. Drugstore chains Walgreens and CVS also made the list. Just under half (43.3%) of those surveyed said they would very likely use drone delivery in the future. Another 30.7% said they were moderately likely to do so. About 15% have little or no plans to use it when it becomes available to them.

AutoZone operates seven stores in Hamilton County, two in Cleveland, two in Dalton, Ga., and others in Ringgold, Ga., Fort Oglethorpe, Athens, Tenn., Etowah, Tenn., and Pikeville, Tenn. The retailer said most of the new hiring will be at stores in Atlanta, Dallas, Cincinnati and Columbus, Ohio, New York City, New Orleans, Pittsburg and Oakland, Calif. AutoZone is the latest U.S. business to tout its hiring plans as Donald Trump becomes president. Trump has praised General Motors, Ford, Carrier, Wal-Mart and other businesses that also have announced expansion or hiring plans in the past month. AutoZone said it will be hiring sales representatives, delivery drivers, parts sales managers, commercial sales managers, store managers and hub specialists. Applications must be submitted online at the AutoZone careers site, www.autozone.com/careers. AutoZone said it has hired more than 10,000 current and former U. S. Military Service members since 2015 and has a goal of hiring more than 15,000 additional transitioning service members and military veterans by 2020. Boeing workers vote on Charleston union The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) filed petition Friday with the National Labor Relations Board to hold a union election for approximately 2,850 production employees at the Boeing Co. in North Charleston, S.C. The filing comes after the IAM postponed a scheduled April 22, 2015, union election amid political criticism of organized labor at the plant. "Boeing workers just want to be treated with the respect they deserve," said IAM Boeing SC Lead Organizer Mike Evans. "Why should they be subject to a different set of standards and rules than folks building the exact same plane in Seattle?" Evans said "it was impossible to hold a free and fair election" in 2015, but he thinks the union is now ready for a union certification election. Workers have remained in contact with IAM organizers in recent months regarding numerous workplace concerns that remain unaddressed, including subjective raises, inconsistent scheduling policies and a lack of respect on the shop floor, Evans said. The NLRB is expected to issue election dates and locations in the coming weeks. The IAM already represents more than 35,000 Boeing employees at 24 locations nationwide. China's growth slows as trade war looms BEIJING — China's economic growth sank to a three-decade low in 2016 as its struggling exporters brace for a possible trade battle with President-elect Donald Trump. Growth in the quarter ending in December ticked up to 6.8 percent over 2015, supported by government spending and a real estate boom, a gain from the previous quarter's 6.7 percent, government data showed Friday. Still, for the full year, growth came in at a lackluster 6.7 percent, down from 6.9 percent in 2015 and the weakest since 1990's 3.9 percent. That temporary upturn is unlikely to last, economists said. 'Net neutrality' foe named to head FCC President Donald Trump has reportedly picked a fierce critic of the Obama-era "net neutrality" rules to be chief regulator of the nation's airwaves and internet connections. Citing unidentified people, Bloomberg and Politico both reported Friday that the next chairman of the Federal Communications Commission will be Ajit Pai, an old hand at the agency. Pai's chief of staff, Matthew Berry, declined to comment. FCC spokesmen did not immediately reply to emails. Pai is one of the two Republican commissioners on a five-member panel that regulates the country's communications infrastructure, including TV, phone and internet service. Las Vegas Sands pays to end probe Las Vegas Sands Corp. will pay almost $7 million to U.S. authorities to end a more than five-year corrupt practices investigation, company and federal officials said Thursday. With the agreement, the company resolved twin probes over more than $60 million paid to an unnamed agent retained in 2006 to acquire a Chinese basketball team, plus other business dealings that include a Beijing real estate deal to promote casinos on the Cotai Strip of Macao. The company wasn't charged with a crime and did not admit guilt in either case. Apple depicts Qualcomm as a shady monopolist SAN FRANCISCO — Apple is suing mobile chip maker Qualcomm for $1 billion in a patent fight pitting the iPhone maker against one of its major suppliers. The complaint filed Friday in a San Diego federal court depicts Qualcomm as a monopolist abusing its power in a key segment of the mobile chip market to extort royalties for iPhone innovations that have nothing to do with Qualcomm's technology. Apple says it has been cooperating with government regulators who have been investigating Qualcomm's business practices, prompting Qualcomm to retaliate by withholding about $1 billion in scheduled payments. Mars Skittles to be used for cattle feed Mars Inc. says it doesn't know why Skittles found on a rural Wisconsin highway might have been headed to become cattle feed. The case began when a Wisconsin sheriff posted on Facebook this week that "hundreds of thousands of Skittles" had been found spilled on a highway. Later, he updated the post to say the candy had fallen off a truck on its way to be cattle feed. A variety of food byproducts are commonly used for animal feed, and Skittles maker Mars says it has procedures for discarding foods for that purpose. However, the company said the Skittles in question came from a factory that doesn't sell unused products for animal feed. AT&T adds 200,000 DirectTV subscribers AT&T beat analysts' expectations and signed up new pay-TV customers for the first time in seven quarters with its new online video streaming service, DirecTV Now. The streaming service offers a lineup that's similar to cable TV but doesn't require a cable box, satellite dish or annual contract. The Dallas-based company reported that at least 200,000 video subscribers signed up in the fourth quarter, according to a Friday filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Analysts were expecting 61,000, according to a Bloomberg report. AT&T launched the new service in late November and pushed a promotional offer for early subscribers of $35 a month for 100-plus channels. That same channel lineup is now $60 a month. AT&T is the largest pay-TV provider in the U.S. with more than 25 million subscribers but it faces a more competitive and fragmented TV landscape. Cable and satellite subscribers are on the decline. The company must fend off new rivals like Netflix, Amazon and Hulu. AT&T's answer is its own video streaming service: DirecTV Now. The streaming service includes a more traditional cable lineup but is missing the CBS network and features such as DVR. Customers must pay extra for premium channels, HBO and Cinemax.

I'm also proud to say near and not in, because I don't like actually living in any town, no matter what the size. I consider my home town a pretty decent sized place. We have two stop lights, four or five policemen to give you a ticket if you run one of them, accidentally, of course, and have our own movie theater. I won't say we have a small town because some city fathers trying to lure Walmart or something to town might be offended. I won't say we have a big town because, well, it just isn't. I'm proud of my small town as are those who live in places like this across the country. Those of us who live in places like Brush, Limon, Nucla, Haxtun, Montecello, Kemmerer and others have an odd way of showing how much we love our small town. We tell small town jokes. In fact, we find ourselves competing with others when telling stories about who has the smallest town. It often becomes a case of the first liar not having a chance. I have a sort of mental collection of "small town" lies (or maybe they are true, in some cases). "I once lived in a town so small both city limit signs were on the same post" is one of my favorites. "Our town was so small we had to take turns being the town drunk" is another favorite. Advertisement "Our town will always be small because it seems like whenever a baby is born, someone leaves town!" "Our town is so small, for fun we all go downtown on Saturday night and watch a haircut." "A big night in our small town is when we all go downtown to the bakery and smell the bread." Other highlights were when they built the interstate through our area; we'd all go down and watch the concrete harden. Our small towns know how to throw a party, too. You haven't lived until you've eaten potato burritos sold by the Catholic women's group during Crowley County Days in Ordway, Colorado. The Christmas tree lighting Thanksgiving night in Rupert, Idaho, is more fun than anything any big impersonal city has to offer. The rodeo in Trinidad, Colorado or Pine Bluff, Wyoming, might be considered by some to be "small town", but the fun is big and the hearts of the people even bigger. Speaking of Rodeos, how about Brush, Colorado "World's Largest Open Rodeo" or whatever they call it now. They feed everyone who attends the first night. Let's see them try that at the National Western Stock Show in Denver. Give me watermelon days at Arkansas Valley Fair over Cannes Film Festival any day. Keep your vacation on the Riviera, I'll hit the sheep dog trials at Meeker, Colorado. In a small town, we all feel a part of the activities. We don't have to pay someone to create our fun. Like someone told me once, "Most places you have to pay someone to provide good fun for you." Here in our town we're all good for nothing!

The Sheriff’s Office on Wednesday recovered four credit card skimmers from the gas pumps at Robinwood One Stop on U.S. 49 at West Wortham Road in Saucier. The skimmers have been siphoning motorists’ personal identifying information while they pumped their gas. Video surveillance shows the same two men and two women at the gas station on three consecutive days before the skimmers were found, the Sheriff’s Office said. On Thursday, a Wal-Mart surveillance video also captured the same four suspects at the Wal-Mart on U.S. 49 in Gulfport. The Sheriff’s Office said the suspects used multiple fabricated cards with stolen numbers to purchase merchandise. They also used a stolen card number on the same day at the Walgreens on U.S. 49 in Gulfport. The suspects were traveling in a 2017 silver Ford Expedition. One of the male suspects has a large tattoo on his upper left arm and a tattoo on the right side of his neck. The other male is bald with a slim build. Both female suspects have long brown hair. One is pregnant and the other has a slim build. Sheriff Troy Peterson has warned customers who bought gas at the One Stop to check their credit card statements. The Sheriff’s Office is asking anyone with information to call 228-896-3000.

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. The flag-draped casket of Master Sgt. Debra Clayton is carried to the hearse during her funeral in Orlando at the First Baptist Church on January 14, 2017. Story highlights Four officers have been killed the first three weeks of the year At least 64 law enforcement officers were shot and killed in 2016 (CNN)Four police officers have been killed in the line of duty this year, according to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund. Last year, 64 officers died in the line of duty. The decade's highest total came in 2011, with 73 officers killed. Here's a look at the officers who have been killed as of January 20, 2017: FLORIDA MASTER SGT. (OFFICER) DEBRA CLAYTON Read More Master Sgt. Debra Clayton Clayton, 42, was shot and killed when she tried to confront a murder suspect in the parking lot of a local Walmart in Florida on January 9. When police arrived on the scene they found the 17-year veteran dead from gunshot wounds. Officers could not revive her after performing CPR. The Orange County Sheriff's Office launched a manhunt that eventually led to the capture of Clayton's suspected shooter -- Markeith Loyd. Markeith Loyd: Suspect in cop killing captured, Orlando police say Loyd had been on the run from authorities for nearly a month. He was wanted in connection to the fatal shooting of Sade Dixon, 24, his pregnant ex- girlfriend outside her home in the Pine Hills neighborhood on December 13, 2016, CNN affiliate WFTV reported. Loyd, 41, has been charged with two counts of murder in the deaths of Dixon and Clayton, said Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings. He also faces charges of attempted murder and aggravated assault for injuries Dixon's family member sustained in the alleged encounter. Clayton's death marks the first fatal shooting of a police officer in the US this year, according to the memorial fund. Clayton was married and the mother of a college-age son. She was promoted posthumously to lieutenant at her funeral. DEPUTY OFFICER NORMAN LEWIS Deputy First Class Norman Lewis Lewis, a deputy first class with the Orange County Sheriff's Office, was killed in a vehicle accident while searching for Clayton's gunman. Lewis, 34, was driving a motorcycle when another vehicle turned in front of him. He died in the crash a couple hours after Clayton was shot. The 11-year veteran in the sheriff's department, mostly worked in the traffic division. The University of Central Florida graduate played in the offensive line on the school's football team from 2000-2003 and earned his degree in criminal justice in 2004, CNN affiliate WFTV reported. NORTH DAKOTA DEPUTY SHERIFF COLT ALLERY Allery, 29, of the Rolette County Sheriff's Office, was fatally shot during a pursuit of a stolen vehicle on Wednesday. The suspect was killed and another officer was wounded in the incident, according to the memorial fund. Allery is the first officer killed in North Dakota this year, the fund said. TEXAS DETECTIVE JERRY WALKER Little Elm Police Detective Jerry Walker was a father of four. Walker, 48, was shot and killed while responding to a 911 call about an armed man outside a home in the Dallas suburb of Little Elm on Tuesday. A standoff ensued. The suspect opened fire from inside the home striking Walker. The suspect was found dead in the home hours later. Walker was transported by helicopter to a local hospital where he later died from his injuries, police said. Walker leaves behind a wife and four children, the youngest just a few months old. The oldest is 22 years old. CNN's Emanuella Grinberg, David Shortell and Ralph Ellis contributed to this report. Content by LendingTree Rates now at 3.2% APR (15 Yr Fixed). Do you qualify?

View Larger  (WFTV) By Cox Media Group ORLANDO, Fl — The Orlando Police Department released helicopter video Thursday of the take down of Markeith Loyd, who is accused of shooting and killing his pregnant ex-girlfriend before gunning down Lt. Debra Clayton in a Walmart parking lot. >> Read more trending stories  Loyd was arrested Tuesday night at an abandoned home in the Carver Shores area following a nine-day manhunt.  The video was released the same day that Loyd appeared in court on murder charges in connection with the death of Sade Dixon, who police said Loyd shot and killed outside her home on Dec. 13.  Loyd became verbally aggressive with the judge in court Thursday as she read the charges against him and explained his options. When Loyd was taken to Orlando police headquarters after his arrest, his face was bloody and bruised and he yelled, “They beat me up” at WFTV’s cameras. Police said Loyd came out of the house Tuesday night armed and wearing tactical gear, but dropped his weapons. Orlando Police Department Chief John Mina spoke at a press conference Thursday, to give more details about not only the arrest of Loyd, but of Clayton’s death.  Mina said Thursday that Loyd did not comply with orders to put his hands behind his back so force was used. He added that Loyd could have had something under the tactical gear, and that officers later found ammunition on Loyd.  [View the story "Police release helicopter video showing take down of Markeith Loyd" on Storify] There are no comments yet.

The Android-based streaming device allows Sling customers to add local broadcast stations into their guide using an external antenna. (STEVE MARCUS / Reuters Photo) Jennifer Van GroveContact Reporter When it comes to television viewing, what’s old is new again as an increasing number of Americans are dumping their cable boxes and going totally retro. That’s right, the tried-and-true TV antenna — just digitally enhanced and minus the goofy bunny ears — is having a moment in the spotlight as people search for cheaper replacements for their cable and satellite TV packages. In fact, since 2013, the percentage of broadband households in the nation using only antennas to watch linear TV has jumped from 9 percent to 15 percent, according to data released this week by Parks Associates. “That's a significant increase and a steady trend upward,” said Brett Sappington, senior director of research at Parks Associate who tracks trends in TV viewing. “There is a bit of a renaissance for the antenna. For many years, the trend in the U.S. was in the rise of pay TV as a primary entertainment option for consumers. But, if you look worldwide, over-the-air broadcasts are by far the dominate way people watch TV channels.” And, really, the resurgence in antenna usage in the U.S. isn’t all that surprising. What with some cable and Internet packages climbing well past $250-per-month, a consumer push back was seemingly inevitable. It certainly doesn’t hurt that all you need is a digital antenna for live access to over-the-air, HD broadcasts on the local stations we all know: ABC, NBC, CBS, FOX, PBS and the CW. Plus, you can find several affordable antenna options at your neighborhood Walmart, and plenty more on Amazon. Better still, once you have said antenna, those broadcast channels are all free. Yes, reception, obviously, varies based on your location, but a handy tool from the Federal Communications Commission makes it easy to gauge what stations have the strongest signals in your neighborhood. The antenna’s comeback can be directly linked to the increasing cost of traditional pay TV packages, Sappington said. At the end of 2016, American households, he said, were paying, on average, $84 a month just for cable or satellite TV. “Data consistently shows that the perceived (lack of) value of pay TV is always the No. 1 reason why people cut the cord,” Sappington said. “They say, ‘My pay TV was not worth what I was paying, and so I canceled.’” Truth be told, the households embracing antennas probably never watched the broadcast networks all that much to begin with.   “My impression is that the vast majority of people using antennas are doing it because they've bought into some … streaming service and don't want to watch that much broadcast TV,” said Paul Verna, an Internet TV analyst with eMarketer. Verna theorizes that these renaissance viewers are really just turning to antennas as a fall back in case of a network TV emergency — say the Super Bowl or a major awards show. This observation aligns with the rise of streaming alternatives, which run the gamut and range from on-demand (Netflix) to live (Sling TV), and to super niche (British-TV-only app Acorn TV). Parks Associates tracks more than 130 of these over-the-top (OTT), as in over-the-Internet, services. It turns out that half of the 63 percent of U.S. broadband households that subscribe to an OTT service subscribe to more than one. Ultimately, these streaming choices let consumers piece together their own version of the classic cable bundle. That behavior is getting easier to do with the arrival of new set-top boxes such as AirTV and Tablo. The former merges streaming services with over-the-air signals, while the latter lets users stream and record over-the-air stations. Both plug into your home’s digital TV antenna. So, while the antenna may seem like a blast from past, it really presents a path to the future.

January 21 12:00 2017 Print This Article Share it With Friends 👤 by AJAY BHAI AMRIT, SUVA  0 Comments   Caressa Shields is a young woman from the poor and desperate inner city slums of America who made Olympic history by becoming the first American Boxer, male or female, to win an Olympic title twice in a row. Born March 17, 1995 she grew up on the mean and dangerous streets of Flint Michigan in a very poor and drug infested environment. Her father, Clarence Shields, was serving a long stint in jail and Claressa was not reunited with him until she was nine years old. His conviction was for aggravated robbery and breaking and entering. The story gets worse as her mother, Marcella, struggled with drug addiction and had so many men coming and going in their house that it was difficult to remember who was who. Growing up, Claressa didn’t always have food on the table and the family received food stamps, but the food stamps never seemed to turn into actual food. Instead they were traded for drugs. This poverty and drugs cycle decimated the family and this is where she started to be the victim of molestation and rape at the tender age of five years old. Whenever her mother got a new boyfriend they would also be a drug user and ultimately some would start to touch and feel her. Claressa was also sexually molested by her youngest brother’s father every day after school as this cycle got more and more extreme. When Claressa was about six years, her mother was employed for a while at a local Wal-Mart store. While her mother worked a family acquaintance would take her into a room and molest her and ultimately rape her. The reason Claressa gave as to why the sexual predators chose to prey on her is the fact that she could not talk and only began to speak after the age of five years. There was nothing she could do as she was in a desperate position where as a young child she could not communicate these instances with anybody. When Claressa was nine years old her dad was finally released from prison and he began to be the father figure she had so longed for in her childhood years. At the age of 11, he bought her along to the boxing gym and this is where Claressa finally found her comfort and spiritual home. She would train day and night getting better and better as days and months went by both in technique and fitness. By the time she was only 16 years old, she was winning all her bouts and was selected to try out for the Olympic trials to be part of the US women’s boxing team, and ended up winning all three fights in the middleweight division to secure her place as an Olympic representative for the USA. At only 17-years-old, she travelled to London to participate in the Olympic Games and against all the odds won the pinnacle of her sport by taking the gold medal. This was a stunning and great achievement, but four years later, this time at the Rio Olympics, at the age of just 21-years-old, she won the gold again in women’s middleweight boxing. Claressa has fought 78 times as an amateur boxer, and has won 77 times – an incredible feat in itself. In addition to winning Olympic gold twice, she won the amateur world championships in 2014 and 2016 and gold as a light heavyweight at the 2015 Pan American Games. Despite having a very scarred childhood, Claressa has finally managed to use her platform to speak out and advocate for women’s rights and also against the evils of sexual assault of any kind. This indeed is a strong woman both mentally and physically, who against the extreme odds has managed to find Olympic glory. Edited by Jonathan Bryce  The writer is a Fiji Sun  columnist.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 5:20 AM, January 21, 2017 CHICAGO - U.S. department store chains, hit by slowing sales for more than two years, have used layoffs, store closings and cutbacks to maintain one aspect of stability: profit margins. An analysis of two important indicators of retail profitability, gross margins and operating margins, shows retailers like Kohl's Corp <KSS.N>, JC Penney Co Inc <JCP.N>, Macy's Inc <M.N> and Target Corp <TGT.N> have done a better job at delivering on profitability than maintaining sales growth. This has given some investors hope for a recovery in a sector battered by the rise of online shopping led by Amazon.com Inc <AMZN.O>, and competition from off-price chains like TJX Cos <TJX.N> and fast fashion retailers like Inditex's Zara. "Margins have been relatively better compared to sales and they are finally taking important steps like closing unprofitable stores," said Charles Sizemore, founder of Sizemore Capital Management LLC, who owns shares of Wal-Mart Stores Inc <WMT.N> and other retailers. "The story right now is bad but we do expect some of these problems to bottom out over time." Gross margins at all four chains have remained steady over the past four years, helped by cost cutting initiatives like store closures. Operating margins have shown recent improvement at some chains like Kohl's and Target, steadily improved for JC Penney, but contracted for others like Macy's. Macy's gross margins at the end of the third quarter of 2016 stood at 39.8 percent, up slightly from 39.2 percent in 2013. Gross margins for Target, which straddles the discount and department store categories, were 30.2 percent in third quarter 2016, roughly unchanged from 30 percent in 2013. JC Penney improved its gross margins over the four-year period, whereas Kohl's has held steady. Operating margins are more sensitive to changes the retailers have made through layoffs. Target stood at 6.5 percent in 2016 up slightly from results for the last two years but down from 10.6 percent in 2013. Target in that time has left foreign markets and sold off lower-margin, non-core businesses like its pharmacy operations. Kohl's operating margins were 7 percent in third quarter 2016 up from 2015 and similar to 2014 but down from 8.2 percent in 2013. Macy's had seen operating margins contract to 1.9 percent in 2016 from 5.7 percent in 2013. JC Penney stood at 0.8 percent in 2016, up substantially from improving every year from a rock bottom level of negative margins of 14.4 in 2013. "Sales are not impressive, but investors are most concerned with profitability and long-term value," Neil Saunders, chief executive officer at research firm Conlumino said. "These companies have done a better job keeping the business running on the operational side and delivering on profitability." SQUEEZING COSTS In recent weeks, most department stores have reported a drop in holiday season sales, which includes stores and online. Some have even slashed their earnings outlooks. This contrasts with industry-wide results, a 4 percent increase in the 2016 holiday season, to $658.3 billion, according to the National Retail Federation. The companies continue to make economy measures such as reducing inventory, pressuring suppliers for lower prices and cutting supply chain costs. For example, Kohl's has said it will offer discounts during the holiday season but cut down on promotions during the rest of the year. Christina Boni, vice president and senior credit analyst at ratings firm Moody's, expects operating margins at many department store chains to remain steady unless sales fall dramatically. "These companies still have the ability to stabilize their business by taking costs out of the system and generating significant free cash flow to invest in new areas, which will improve operating margins," she said.

Douglas Garland, right, is being tried on three counts of first-degree murder. (Court evidence/Canadian Press) Related Stories LIVE BLOG | Latest updates from Douglas Garland triple murder trial in Calgary Tampered lock and disabled router: Douglas Garland triple murder trial hears evidence from Liknes home How to talk to your kids about the Garland trial Douglas Garland's triple murder trial hears investigators collected teeth, bone and bloody bedding Douglas Garland's sister pointed police to her brother as suspect, jurors in triple murder trial hea Douglas Garland killed Calgary couple and grandson over 'petty grudge,' court hears Bloody footprints found at the Calgary house where a boy and his grandparents were last seen matched the shape and size of a pair of shoes missing from Douglas Garland's home, jurors at his triple murder trial heard Friday. Sgt. Lynn Gallen — a foot impression expert who has examined more than 4,000 crime scenes — was among the police officers sent to the home of Alvin and Kathy Liknes on June 30, 2014, after a 911 call about three missing persons. Douglas Garland killed Calgary couple and grandson over 'petty grudge,' Crown tells jury Investigators collected teeth, bone and bloody bedding, court hears during Garland triple-murder trial Jennifer O'Brien had called after arriving at the house to pick up her son Nathan, 5, who had slept over at his grandparents' home. She found a door open, the house empty and she saw a lot of blood. The RCMP lab identified one of the bloody footprints found at the Liknes house as being made by a Dr. Scholl shoe, Gallen told the jury on Friday, the fifth day of Garland's trial in Calgary on three counts of first-degree murder. When police searched the farm where Garland lived with his parents near Airdrie, north of Calgary, a week after the family had gone missing, they found three shoe boxes, including one for a Dr. Scholl's Delta 2 in size 13 wide, court heard. Normally Gallen would be given a suspect's shoes for comparison with the footprints found at a crime scene. But because none were found in the Garland case, detectives bought a pair in the same style and size from Walmart, Gallen told court. This image of footprints was entered into evidence at the triple-murder trial of Douglas Garland. (Court exhibit) Gallen said one of the bloody footprints in the Liknes garage lined up "very nicely" with the Dr. Scholl's shoe impression, Gallen testified. "They do correspond in shape and size," she testified.​ Police still in 'rescue mode' Det. Mike Shute with the Calgary Police Service testified next, saying he went through the Liknes home on July 2 with a medical examiner, trying to assess exactly what had happened inside. Shute said at that time police were still in "rescue mode," as they knew the missing victims had likely suffered significant injuries but were still unaware of their whereabouts. On July 4, Shute said he met with Douglas Garland's sister Patti Garland, who had contacted police about a green truck investigators had been looking for, which she said she recognized as belonging to her family. Garland is connected to the Liknes family through Patti, who was in a common-law relationship with Alvin Liknes's son, Allen. Shute said an emergency response team was geared up to raid the Garland residence in rural Airdrie on the evening of July 4. Garland arrested Garland was arrested that same evening, in a traffic stop about one kilometre south of the property. When Shute arrived at the traffic stop, he said Garland was already in handcuffs and sitting on the side of the road. Shute said he questioned Garland, who was sober, coherent and co-operative in his answers. Garland was then taken to Calgary police headquarters while Shute went to the Garland property, where he said he found a burn barrel that was still smouldering. The trial adjourned for the day after the Crown finished questioning Shute set to resume Monday morning, when the defence will cross-examine the detective.

Tampered lock and DNA found Court heard evidence on Thursday about drill holes in the lock on the side door at the Liknes home that allowed entry. Earlier in the trial, Crown prosecutors told jurors they would hear evidence that Garland did computer research on the exact same lock found to have been tampered with. Teeth were found on the floor at the Liknes home, and bones and a small tooth were found in burn barrels on the Garland farm, jurors heard earlier this week. Douglas Garland killed Calgary couple and grandson over 'petty grudge,' court hears Forensic analysis of Garland's computer hard drive will be presented as evidence, showing someone researched topics such as "how to kill without emotion," torture and autopsies, prosecutor Vicki Faulkner told the jury earlier this week. Jurors also heard that DNA evidence from the missing family members was found on a saw and meat hooks owned by Garland. Through what Faulkner described as "dumb luck," a mapping plane that flew over the Garland farm on July 1 and 2, 2014, took photographs that show what the Crown believes to be three bodies in the grass of two adults and a child curled up beside them. Lawyers Kim Ross and Jim Lutz are representing Garland. Faulkner and Shane Parker are prosecuting the case.

Debra Clayton's cruiser was defaced with graffiti, Orlando Police said Friday. (Orlando Police) BY Christopher Brennan NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Friday, January 20, 2017, 2:57 PM The police cruiser of slain Orlando officer Lt. Debra Clayton, serving as a makeshift memorial, has been defaced with graffiti. Clayton was using the car when she was shot and killed outside a Walmart while trying to capture Markeith Loyd, who was accused of the murder of his girlfriend Sade Dixon. Loyd was captured with Clayton’s handcuffs Tuesday night, and now faces charges for both her and Dixon’s killings. The slain officer’s car was placed outside of police headquarters, though by Friday morning blue graffiti was scrawled next to flowers and an American flag laid on its hood in her memory. SEE IT: Florida cops release video of Markeith Loyd's arrest Clayton was killed last week while trying to apprehend murder suspect Markeith Loyd. (Joe Burbank/AP) Most of the messages did not seem to pertain directly to Clayton, with legible messages including “Angela Madison is the best,” “Steve” and “Kansas.” One message said “to protect & serve” with “the public” a short ways away. Police told the Orlando Sentinel that they are checking security cameras to look for vandals. Markeith Loyd is accused of murdering Clayton as well as his girlfriend Sade Dixon. (Red Huber/AP) In addition to the cruiser memorial, the department announced on Twitter that the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey had sent it a flag that flew over the World Trade Center earlier this month. SEE IT: Accused Fla. cop killer's court tirade (GRAPHIC LANGUAGE) Loyd, who is being held without bond, went on a tirade in court on Thursday morning, telling a judge “f--- you.” He has also said that he was beaten during his arrest, and aerial video released by police Friday showed two officers kicking him in the head when he was on the ground. Orlando Police Chief John Mina said that Loyd did not obey officer commands during his apprehension, and that there is an investigation underway into the use of force.

Win tickets to the Rachel Ray Burger Bash at the SOBE Wine and Food Festival. Enter now! Business Boca Raton company app combines gaming with shopping Carline Jean / Sun Sentinel Stocket app by Boca Raton company that has developed a new app that combines mobile gaming with shopping. Carline Jean/Staff Photographer Stocket app by Boca Raton company that has developed a new app that combines mobile gaming with shopping. Carline Jean/Staff Photographer (Carline Jean / Sun Sentinel) Marcia Heroux PoundsContact Reporter New app Stocket allows users to sell products from national retailers online Privacy Policy Gaming and shopping. For consumers and entrepreneurs with those passions, it's an intriguing combination. That's what Boca Raton startup business Social Voucher is counting on to draw players for its new mobile app, Stocket. Consumers can both play the Stocket game and become an online business owner where they can sell products from 1,600 retailers including Walmart, Best Buy, Nike and Macy's. For each sale made, players receive a rebate from Social Voucher. They also get discounts on their own purchases. "You play the life of a store owner and stock products. You're competing with your friends — who can make the most sales and build the biggest store," explained Michael Grimaldi, 40, one of the game's inventors and lead product developer for Social Voucher. Grimaldi teamed with experienced businessman Gerald C. Parker in 2013 to build Social Voucher and its Stocket mobile app to the masses. "The psychology of gaming and shopping are the same — they're habitual," said Parker, 74, who has had a long career in nurturing startup businesses, taking companies public and making mergers and acquisitions. Carline Jean / Sun Sentinel Michael Grimaldi, left, Product developer and Gerald Parker, founder of Social Voucher, which has developed a new app that combines mobile gaming with shopping. Carline Jean/Staff Photographer Michael Grimaldi, left, Product developer and Gerald Parker, founder of Social Voucher, which has developed a new app that combines mobile gaming with shopping. Carline Jean/Staff Photographer (Carline Jean / Sun Sentinel) Parker, the CEO, said Social Voucher is in three of the hot technology spaces: e-commerce, gaming and augmented reality. "We've got all the bases covered," said Parker, who has raised $8 million to develop Stocket. Parker "is not afraid to look into the future," said Gary Smith, CEO of NIT Enterprises, a genetics research company in Palm Beach Gardens. Smith has known Parker since he sold a company to him in the late 1990s. "Parker has been good about making money for everyone around him," Smith said. He said Parker also is good with working with younger people who need guidance in building a business. "He's the most positive person I've ever met. He keeps his cool and doesn't show his hand," Smith said. The app officially launches in February, the partners said. Stocket is free to download on a smart phone or tablet; players can purchase add-ons to enhance play. Kaitlyn Frame, 19, who is studying multimedia journalism at Lynn University in Boca Raton, learned about the app from a friend at school. She is in the process of adding a second level to her "store" which features her favorite Target items. "It's really fun. I didn't know I was going to enjoy it this much," said Frame, who said she used to play the Sims game, where players create and control "people." Stocket also offers a "real life" aspect. "I see myself continuing to play it. It's really entertaining." Stocket store owners get discounts on purchases including airline tickets and hotel rooms through Expedia and movie tickets through Fandango. Users can create any kind of online store they want, pulling in actual photos of products through Stocket to feature in their store. When they introduce a new product to Stocket, they earn a "badge" to sell an item exclusively, but have to log in every day to retain that privilege, Grimaldi said. The demographics of gamers have changed in recent years, with 47 percent of gamers between 18 and 49 years old; and 41 percent are women, according to the 2016 Computer and Video Game Industry report by the Entertainment Software Association. Social Voucher is able to sell retail products through marketing aggregators including CJ Affiliate by Conversant -- formerly Commission Junction -- LinkShare and FlexOffers, which already have permission to do so, Grimaldi said. The company makes money through a percentage of products sold as well as advertising, which becomes part of the game, on "blimps" and high-rise buildings . Grimaldi turned to Parker to guide him in building Social Voucher, after a disappointing experience with a previous business. He developed a point-of-sale tablet for doctors — only to find it shelved by company that acquired it. He is looking to Parker to position Social Voucher for acquisition. "I wanted to focus on the technology," Grimaldi said, who has filed for a patent on the Stocket gaming system and worked with Parker to build the company's technology team. In 2014, the company acquired Wisconsin-based ARrival Labs, for both the augmented reality technology and its developers, many of whom continue to work from Madison. They also kept ARrival Labs' developer team in Vietnam, led by Guilaume Riviere. Ttwo developers work in Israel. Key employees have stock or options in the company, which Parker believes helps a company succeed. "There's a huge difference in motivation," he said. The international talent also provides a 24-hour cycle of development, Grimaldi said. "When we're sleeping, they're coding." Grimaldi envisions many ways to grow the company, including an augmented reality aspect to the game — like Pokemon — where participants could obtain real gift cards. He thinks retailers will want to become more involved in Stocket. Retailers, he said, "are looking for anything innovative because they're losing market share to e-commerce." He also sees Stocket appealing to celebrities who have brands and might want to open a Stocket store, which could lead to them tweeting about the app. "That is golden marketing," he said. mpounds@sunsentinel.com or 561-243-6650 Copyright © 2017, Sun Sentinel Florida snags more venture capital, angel dollars in 2016 Magic Leap names new chief marketing officer; in face of critics, CEO says ‘fun is just beginning’ All Sections News Sports Broward Palm Beach Entertainment Classified Obituaries 69°

On Thursday, Markeith Loyd spouted profanities during his first appearance on charges he killed his pregnant ex-girlfriend, saying, “F— you,” to the same judge, CNN affiliate WFTV-TV in Orlando reported. Loyd was captured Tuesday night in an abandoned house in Orlando after more than a month on the run. He is charged with killing Sade Dixon on December 13 and police Lt. Debra Clayton outside a Walmart on January 9. Police night-vision video shows officers apprehending Loyd and two of them apparently kicking him. Orlando police Chief John Mina said Loyd did not follow orders to put his hands behind his back. Police are investigating Loyd’s allegations that officers beat him up. He appeared in court with a bandage over an eye. Loyd’s court appearance Friday was brief. He did not enter a plea to any of the charges against him. “I ain’t no Markeith Loyd,” he said to Orange County Judge Jeanette Dejuras Bigney. “Who are you?” He asked for her name several times and did not answer when asked twice whether he wanted a public defender. On Thursday, he told Bigney he had not resisted arrest and that he wanted to represent himself. 28.538335 -81.379236 Filed in: News Topics: Markeith Loyd, Orlando police shooting Suggest a correction × Suggest A Correction Your name Your email Report a typo or grammatical error Cancel Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest LinkedIn Email The News 3 App Center Get the latest news and live radar on your phone!

You are right about health benefits of cranberries and I’m glad you shared a favorite family recipe, but I also want to address your comments about Wisconsin growing practices. For those interested in more information, please visit http://wiscran.org/sustainability or view videos at http://www.wiscran.org/sustainability/sustainability-in-action. You can also read a University of Wisconsin Extension report on sustainable cranberry production at http://www.wiscran.org/media/1322/sustainablecranberry_final_web.pdf. Wisconsin growers embody sustainable farming, committing to research and practices that reduce environmental impact. The majority of our growers work with the USDA Natural Resource Conservation Service to create nutrient management plans, and 77 percent hire professional integrated pest management consultants to best manage the biological and ecological considerations of pest control. Additionally, 88 percent of growers use alternative practices to pesticides to manage pests. As for water, it is the lifeblood of our industry. Responsible use is of utmost importance and while some growers borrow water to flood cranberry beds for harvest, and it is always our goal to return that water in the same or better condition and quality, and studies show this to be the case. I wanted to make sure this information was put forward for your readers, as we disagree with the environmental statements in the article and urge readers to learn more. As for organic growers, we have many in Wisconsin and WSCGA represents several. Our growers use different growing practices to meet different consumer preferences and we respect both, without misrepresenting commercial growing practices. K. Whitlock Wisconsin State Cranberry Growers Association Honesty appreciated On Jan. 6, we went to Walmart and when we left the store we forgot our Verizon tablet we had used in the photo area. We just want to give a big “thank you” to the person who was so honest and took it to customer service. Will Weegens Naloxone can save a life The use of Naloxone can save a life. Naloxone, also known as Narcan is an opioid antagonist used in opioid overdoses to counteract the life-threatening depression of the respiratory system. It allows an overdose victim to breathe normally. Although traditionally administered by emergency response personnel, naloxone can be administered by lay people or the public, making it ideal for treating heroin and other opioids overdoses. The training is simple and use of Naloxone results in a life saved. Here is what occurs in an opioid overdose. When too much of any opioid, like heroin goes into too many receptors, the respiratory system slows and the person breathes more slowly, then not at all. Because Naloxone basically knocks the opioids out of the opiate receptors in the brain, the overdose is reversed and the person is able to breathe again. However, it is a temporary drug that will wear off in 30-90 minutes and the person should be watched for signs of continued overdose. The overdose victim must seek medical assistance or call 911. Lack of oxygen from opioid overdose may lead to brain injury in as little as four minutes, yet the average EMS response time is 9.4 minutes. Seconds can count during an opioid overdose so it is vital if you have a loved one or friends who use, you need to have a plan in place. Most life-threatening opioid emergencies occur in the home, witnessed by friends or family. Brand names of Naloxone are Evzio, Narcan injection, Narcan Nasal Spray. They all come with simple, life-saving directions and are easy to administer. Upon purchase, read and know how to use these devices and keep them readily available. Some states have a third-party law where a concerned parent, employee or nurse at a school can obtain Naloxone and administer it without facing legal repercussions (known as the good Samaritan act). If you come in contact with a high-risk individual, you should have this life-saving overdose antidote. For more information and the availability of Naloxone, go to http://www.narcononnewliferetreat.org/blog/naloxone-availability.html.

By Evan Clark on January 20, 2017 Share This Article Reddit LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Print Talk Donald & Melania Trump REX/Shutterstock Now it is Donald Trump’s turn. In his first act as the 45th President of the United States, Trump declared that his ascent marked a transfer of power from the elites in Washington to the people of the nation, doubling down on the populist message that won him the election. Now the question is how that ambition will translate into new policies that will govern American life and business. “From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land,” Trump said in his inaugural address to throngs of supporters on the National Mall, given against the backdrop of the Capitol decked out in red, white and blue. “From this day forward, it’s going to be only America first, America first,” he said. “Every decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs will be made to benefit American workers and American families. We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries, making our products, stealing our companies and destroying our jobs. “Protection will lead to great prosperity and strength,” he said. “I will fight for you with every breath in my body and I will never let you down. America will start winning again, winning like never before. We will bring back our jobs, we will bring back our borders, we will bring back our wealth and we will bring back our dreams.…Now arrives the time for action.” That action will set the tone of the country for at least four years and potentially for some time to come beyond that. The business world has welcomed Trump as one of their own. After a steep decline in the hours immediately following the election, Wall Street pivoted and rallied strongly on hopes of business-friendly policies. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has gained 8.2 percent since the election and was trading up 0.3 percent to 19,787.22 as the president was sworn in on Friday. As happy as the financial types are (for now), many designers have bristled at the thought of Trump as commander in chief, and Trump has bristled back. On Thursday, Trump in Washington ahead of his inauguration told lunch guests, according to a source, that: “Tom Ford came out and said he was not dressing Melania. He was never asked. I never liked him or his designs. He’s never had something to dress like that [pointing to his wife, who was in the room at the time].” (Melania sported Ralph Lauren for her husband’s inauguration ceremony). None of this is business as usual in Washington, where hundreds of thousands are preparing to march on Saturday in response to the new president. Trump, a political novice who was best known as a flashy reality TV star and billionaire real estate tycoon, started on this path with controversy, disparaging Mexican immigrants: “They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.” And while that alienated Hispanics, a key voting demographic, it played to a constituency underappreciated by many: The millions of working-class whites that were left behind as decades of trade deals sent jobs overseas. He fired up the 61 million voters who gave him an electoral college win with a decidedly emotional approach, kicking off a revolving set of feuds with just about everyone. “I could say, oh, I’m not angry,” he said a year ago. “I’m very angry because our country is being run horribly and I will gladly accept the mantle of anger.” Now, Trump supporters are hopeful that the late-night flurry of Tweets that have fueled The Donald will lead to real change in their lives. Many companies, including Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Ford, have made a show of keeping jobs in the U.S. since the election, although it is sill far from clear how ambitions to bolster the U.S. by keeping tighter borders will play out in reality. But other changes are also coming to the culture, with many pointing to Trump’s in-your-face style and his looseness with facts as influential markers of his presidency. “The concept of truth does not exist anymore,” said Martin Lindstrom, a business consultant who mixes brand marketing and neuroscience. “You’re allowed to say whatever you want, as long as you stick with it and you’re brash. Brands will become much more opinionated now. We’ll have brands that will stand for something, these brands will not be afraid of having an enemy now.” And while an American election always reverberates around the world, Trump’s ascendency is being watched with particular trepidation abroad with political and corporate leaders alike gauging just how much of his fiery rhetoric will turn into the sweeping changes he’s promised. Trump has vowed to impose a tariff of up to 45 percent on goods from China, slash the U.S. corporate tax rate to 15 from 35 percent and reshape the workforce by bolstering the manufacturing sector and imposing stricter immigration rules. (On the broader scene, he has moved to strengthen ties with Russia, questioned the need for NATO, challenged the bedrock One China policy, suggested moving the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem — all dramatic shifts that could have far-reaching and unforeseeable consequences in the global order). Many executives are taking a wait-and-see approach — and have little option to do otherwise. Alibaba executive chairman Jack Ma tried to give the concept of globalization a shot in the arm with a speech at the 2017 World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in Davos, Switzerland, this week, and urged people to give Trump a chance. “Give President Donald Trump some time,” Ma said. “He has an open mind.” The tech mogul and Chinese e-commerce king also noted that a trade war, which a big jump in tariffs could spark, “would be a disaster for the two countries and the world. I would do anything to stop it.” Companies of all sorts are in a holding pattern. U.S. retailers, already struggling with sweeping technology change, flagging foot traffic and a consumer apathy toward fashion, could be both helped and hurt by Trump’s proposals. A lower corporate tax rate would certainly be welcome and could give many ailing companies a big bottom-line boost, but most fashion retailers primarily sell goods made oversees and are subject to tariffs or trade agreements (that could now be renegotiated). Mariana Kou, an analyst at CLSA, this week advised investors to sell shares of sourcing giant Li & Fung given both the weakness at traditional retailers like Kohl’s Corp. and Macy’s Inc. and questions about Trump’s orientation to the rest of the world. “There is significant uncertainty on policies of the Trump administration,” Kou said. “While we may see some support for domestic consumption, the destocking cycle and the smaller-order size amid a fast-changing retail industry mean that we may not see a pick up at Li & Fung in the next nine to 12 months. Trump’s rather protectionist stance could further hurt Li & Fung’s trading business.” While international trade is, by its very nature a series of business transactions, the rules regulating cross-border trade have long been used as leverage by nations pursuing broader strategic goals, including for defense or coalition-building. In the view of Wilbur Ross, the turnaround specialist who has in the past invested heavily in the textiles industry and is Trump’s pick to head the Commerce Department, trade is an area in which the buyer has a lot of leverage. “On the topic of retaliation [to U.S. punitive tariffs], my mind-set will be that the world’s largest customer is dealing with its vendors,” he said at his Senate confirmation hearing. “I view these other countries with whom we have trade as vendors. While you need to treat the vendors with respect, they must also treat you as their largest customer both with respect and more importantly, playing by the rules of the road. To the degree they don’t, it must be enforcement.” In times of great disruption, companies often look to strengthen their hands through mergers and acquisitions, but the landscape needs to be settled enough to get the deal done. “Global geopolitical changes — a new U.S. presidential administration, upcoming European elections, the persisting threat of terrorist activity and the Brexit referendum — along with a strengthening U.S. dollar, will impact transaction activity, as well as consumer spending,” wrote Cathy Leonhardt and David Shiffman, co-heads of Peter J. Solomon Co.’s global retail advisory group, in an analysis. “In the United States, uncertainty surrounding policy decisions the Trump administration will make with respect to key matters such as corporate taxes, tariffs, foreign investment and trade agreements will result in a ‘wait-and-see’ approach to deal-making, as potential acquirers await clarity on policy direction and the impacts of such policies both on the acquirers’ businesses and those of potential targets,” the bankers said. The future path should come into sharper focus in the weeks and months ahead as Trump settles in to his new office and sets about turning his dreams for the nation into reality.

Harvested from high atop the Colorado Rocky Mountains, the King Rustics from MountainKing may look like a traditional russet, however their lighter, tan skin and golden flesh creates a smoother, moister and richer taste when compared to traditional russets. Available through February, the King Rustics are a sure-fire way to bring out the best in Creamy Garlic Mashed Potatoes, Twice-Baked Sour Cream and Chive Potatoes, Mashed Sweet and Russet Potatoes with Herbs, Horseradish Whipped Potatoes, Baked Mashed Potatoes with Parmesan Cheese and a host of other great-tasting dishes.   Besides their great tastes, the King Rustics are jam-packed with vitamins, minerals and fibers, particularly in their peels, as well as antioxidants that may protect the body against certain types of cancers and heart disease.  One serving of potatoes provides 45% of the recommended Daily Value of vitamin C while one potato contains more potassium than a banana.   The King Rustics, like all MountainKing varieties, are naturally fat free, cholesterol free and contain no sodium.  Plus, they are low in calories and fiber-rich, providing between 5 and 16 grams of fiber per one-cup serving. According to the USDA, a good diet should include about 28 grams of fiber daily for an intake of 2,000 calories per day.

Clayton was killed Monday, January 9, 2017 and a manhunt is under way for the gunman who shot her, the Orlando Police Department said. Credit: Orange County Sheriff's Office/Orlando Police Department (CNN) — Four police officers have been killed in the line of duty this year, according to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund. Last year, 64 officers died in the line of duty. The decade’s highest total came in 2011, with 73 officers killed. Here’s a look at the officers who have been killed as of January 20, 2017: FLORIDA MASTER SGT. (OFFICER) DEBRA CLAYTON Clayton, 42, was shot and killed when she tried to confront a murder suspect in the parking lot of a local Walmart in Florida on January 9. When police arrived on the scene they found the 17-year veteran dead from gunshot wounds. Officers could not revive her after performing CPR. The Orange County Sheriff’s Office launched a manhunt that eventually led to the capture of Clayton’s suspected shooter — Markeith Loyd. Loyd had been on the run from authorities for nearly a month. He was wanted in connection to the fatal shooting of Sade Dixon, 24, his pregnant ex- girlfriend outside her home in the Pine Hills neighborhood on December 13, 2016, CNN affiliate WFTV reported. Loyd, 41, has been charged with two counts of murder in the deaths of Dixon and Clayton, said Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings. He also faces charges of attempted murder and aggravated assault for injuries Dixon’s family member sustained in the alleged encounter. Clayton’s death marks the first fatal shooting of a police officer in the US this year, according to the memorial fund. Clayton was married and the mother of a college-age son. She was promoted posthumously to lieutenant at her funeral. DEPUTY OFFICER NORMAN LEWIS Lewis, a deputy first class with the Orange County Sheriff’s Office, was killed in a vehicle accident while searching for Clayton’s gunman. Lewis, 34, was driving a motorcycle when another vehicle turned in front of him. He died in the crash a couple hours after Clayton was shot. The 11-year veteran in the sheriff’s department, mostly worked in the traffic division. The University of Central Florida graduate played in the offensive line on the school’s football team from 2000-2003 and earned his degree in criminal justice in 2004, CNN affiliate WFTV reported. NORTH DAKOTA DEPUTY SHERIFF COLT ALLERY Allery, 29, of the Rolette County Sheriff’s Office, was fatally shot during a pursuit of a stolen vehicle on Wednesday. The suspect was killed and another officer was wounded in the incident, according to the memorial fund. Allery is the first officer killed in North Dakota this year, the fund said. TEXAS DETECTIVE JERRY WALKER Walker, 48, was shot and killed while responding to a 911 call about an armed man outside a home in the Dallas suburb of Little Elm on Tuesday. A standoff ensued. The suspect opened fire from inside the home striking Walker. The suspect was found dead in the home hours later. Walker was transported by helicopter to a local hospital where he later died from his injuries, police said. Walker leaves behind a wife and four children, the youngest just a few months old. The oldest is 22 years old. CNN’s Emanuella Grinberg, David Shortell and Ralph Ellis contributed to this report.

(Journal file photo) Print Email Corey McDonald | The Jersey Journal By Corey McDonald | The Jersey Journal The Jersey Journal on January 20, 2017 at 11:49 AM, updated January 20, 2017 at 12:33 PM comments SECAUCUS - Early last month, Secaucus police received a call from the Douglas County Sheriff's Department in Colorado alerting them that an elderly couple had been targeted in a financial scam. As a result, the couple had wired thousands of dollars to people in New Jersey - including Secaucus - not realizing they were being scammed.  But after some detective work, police arrested Yara Taveras, a 35-year-old resident of Paterson, and charged with theft by deception. "Our detectives did a good job on this," said police Capt. Dennis Miller. In early December, the couple in Colorado received a phone call from someone impersonating a law enforcement officer who told them their son was in a car accident and had been charged with DWI. They were told to wire $2,350 to a Walmart in Fair Lawn to pay for their son's bail, which they did, Miller said.  Several days later, the couple received another call, this time from someone impersonating a lawyer. They were told to wire an additional $2,500 to the Walmart in Secaucus to cover their son's legal fees, Miller said.   But with the assistance of the Paterson Police Department, local police "developed enough probable cause based on that to charge [Taveras] with the crime in Secaucus," Miller said. Taveras faces charges of theft by deception and conspiracy to commit theft by deception in connection to the money that was wired to the Secaucus Walmart. Secaucus police caution residents to be wary of financial scams such as these and to always call the individuals or party involved prior to sending money to anyone. "We would like to caution everyone - especially the elderly - to verify with their family members prior to sending any money anywhere for any reason," Miller said. "Unfortunately, sometimes it falls on deaf ears and emotions get in the way."

Clayton was killed Monday, January 9, 2017 and a manhunt is under way for the gunman who shot her, the Orlando Police Department said. Credit: Orange County Sheriff's Office/Orlando Police Department (CNN) Four police officers have been killed in the line of duty this year, according to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund. Last year, 64 officers died in the line of duty. The decade's highest total came in 2011, with 73 officers killed. Here's a look at the officers who have been killed as of January 20, 2017: FLORIDA MASTER SGT. (OFFICER) DEBRA CLAYTON Clayton, 42, was shot and killed when she tried to confront a murder suspect in the parking lot of a local Walmart in Florida on January 9. When police arrived on the scene they found the 17-year veteran dead from gunshot wounds. Officers could not revive her after performing CPR. The Orange County Sheriff's Office launched a manhunt that eventually led to the capture of Clayton's suspected shooter -- Markeith Loyd. Loyd had been on the run from authorities for nearly a month. He was wanted in connection to the fatal shooting of Sade Dixon, 24, his pregnant ex- girlfriend outside her home in the Pine Hills neighborhood on December 13, 2016, CNN affiliate WFTV reported. Loyd, 41, has been charged with two counts of murder in the deaths of Dixon and Clayton, said Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings. He also faces charges of attempted murder and aggravated assault for injuries Dixon's family member sustained in the alleged encounter. Clayton's death marks the first fatal shooting of a police officer in the US this year, according to the memorial fund. Clayton was married and the mother of a college-age son. She was promoted posthumously to lieutenant at her funeral. DEPUTY OFFICER NORMAN LEWIS Lewis, a deputy first class with the Orange County Sheriff's Office, was killed in a vehicle accident while searching for Clayton's gunman. Lewis, 34, was driving a motorcycle when another vehicle turned in front of him. He died in the crash a couple hours after Clayton was shot. The 11-year veteran in the sheriff's department, mostly worked in the traffic division. The University of Central Florida graduate played in the offensive line on the school's football team from 2000-2003 and earned his degree in criminal justice in 2004, CNN affiliate WFTV reported. NORTH DAKOTA DEPUTY SHERIFF COLT ALLERY Allery, 29, of the Rolette County Sheriff's Office, was fatally shot during a pursuit of a stolen vehicle on Wednesday. The suspect was killed and another officer was wounded in the incident, according to the memorial fund. Allery is the first officer killed in North Dakota this year, the fund said. TEXAS DETECTIVE JERRY WALKER Walker, 48, was shot and killed while responding to a 911 call about an armed man outside a home in the Dallas suburb of Little Elm on Tuesday. A standoff ensued. The suspect opened fire from inside the home striking Walker. The suspect was found dead in the home hours later. Walker was transported by helicopter to a local hospital where he later died from his injuries, police said. Walker leaves behind a wife and four children, the youngest just a few months old. The oldest is 22 years old. Copyright 2017 Cable News Network/Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

No One Will Believe The $20 Bills You Printed At Home Are Real Money Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share No One Will Believe The $20 Bills You Printed At Home Are Real Money Image courtesy of frankieleon January 20, 2017 11:03 am EST By Mary Beth Quirk@marybethquirk bad consumers by the by counterfeit money crime psas you have only yourself to blame Your home printer might be truly awesome, but unless you’re trying to trick cashiers who have no concept of what real money looks like, you’re probably not going to fool anyone into thinking that the $20 bills produced in your home office are the real deal. According to police, a Florida woman had not only been passing around fake money, but she’d been making it herself at home by printing out copies of $20 bills, reports The Gainseville Sun. A Walmart employee spotted the five counterfeit $20 bills without too much trouble when the suspect handed them over on Jan. 14, the Lake City Police Department said. When the cashier questioned the woman about the funny money, she fled. On Jan. 16, similar printed money showed up at a local Applebee’s, where a patron had left the bills to pay her tab. She also forgot her phone at the restaurant, allowing police to navigate her paper trail pretty darn easily. Police contacted the phone’s owner and arranged to meet at a nearby hotel to return it. While there, an officer pulled the fake money out of a bag and asked her about it. The woman “immediately became embarrassed and began to stammer as she spoke,” the police department said, and admitted using the money at Applebee’s. Police later found “numerous counterfeit bills, along with blank paper and a printer” in a hotel room. “It was determined that [the suspect] had not only been passing counterfeit bills, but that she had been producing them herself,” LCPD said. Officers discovered marijuana and other drug paraphernalia, as well. The suspect was arrested on possession of counterfeit bills, possession of marijuana, and possession of drug equipment. The U.S. Secret Service is also looking into her case, said LCPD. She’s also earned herself a spot in the “You Only Have Yourself To Blame” Hall Of Fame, where she has plenty of company: • A fellow who left a literal trail of cash leading straight to him from the scene of a bank robbery. • The bank robbery suspect who led police straight to his house when he swiped his ATM card before demanding cash. • The would-be robber who had to be rescued by firefighters after tried to crawl through a pizzeria’s ventilation duct to steal and got stuck. • The bank robbery suspect who was caught by police when he stopped for lunch at a casino. • The KFC worker who pulled a gun on his boss and returned for a paycheck the next day. • Suspected thieves who police said tried to sell a pawn shop owner his own stuff back, unaware that they’d purloined it from him in the first place. • A guy who police overhead planning a burglary after he unwittingly butt-dialed 9-1-1. • The burglary suspect who made things pretty easy by falling through the store’s ceiling… in front of cops. • A man who was freed after 15 years in prison for robbery who was accused of heading straight back there to rob it again. • The students who were arrested after allegedly stealing a $7,500 Ronald McDonald figure and then completing their drive-thru order. • A guy who was found sleeping in his car at a McDonald’s drive-thru who was charged with DUI after he tried to pay cops for his burgers. • The burglary suspect who broke into a restaurant and was caught after he tried to cook himself up some tasty crab cakes. • A man accused of burgling a fried chicken restaurant who found himself in handcuffs when he returned to the eatery the next day — and wearing the same clothes, no less. • The guy found snoozing at a Wendy’s drive-thru who woke up to a DUI and no fries. • The father-daughter duo accused of going on a burglary spree who were nabbed after she posted a doctored Microsoft employee badge on Facebook. • The criminal mastermind whose brilliantly plotted heist was undone after he returned to the scene to grab a remote control for the sound system he allegedly stole 30 minutes before. • A real-life Hamburglar accused of robbing a McDonald’s who was caught when he crashed into the local mayor. • Yet another snoozer, this time, a guy police found asleep in the McDonald’s drive-thru who was charged with driving while intoxicated after scoring a blood alcohol content of 0.14%. • The guy accused of breaking into Walmart and trying to saw through the ceiling of the store’s cash room while an employee was present. • The blabby teen who bragged online about pulling off a bank robbery. He apparently thought no one watches YouTube. • A would-be Walmart robber who was unfortunate to get hit by his own getaway vehicle. • The timid bank robber who scared himself silly by shooting his gun, and ended up fleeing without cash. • An accused robber of storage units who left behind a pizza box with his address on it. • The accused thief who made the rookie mistake of uploading pics from a stolen iPad to the cloud. • Speaking of uploading things, there was the time when a Disney cruise worker accused of stealing an iPhone unwittingly sent photos to the cloud of his adventures with the pilfered device. • The guy who reported the theft of an iPhone he’d just stolen from someone else to the police. • A very sleepy man who allegedly broke into a bar and then took a nice nap on the kitchen table.

View FAQ or Contact Us close [x] Share: Facebook Twitter Google+ Share LinkedIn Email iStock/Shutterstock If you think spending a few months in the sun every year is a great idea, but only for millionaires, it’s time to reconsider. We’d like to let you in on a little secret. More than a million Canadians aged 55 and up have learned the ins and outs of leading a snowbird lifestyle—and many of them don’t have big budgets. As you’ve probably heard, snowbird is a term used to describe a Canadian who regularly spends time in warm-weather spots in U.S. Sunbelt states like Florida, Arizona, Texas and California, as well as Mexico, for up to six months every year. Some drive down in campers or RVs while others rent condos or houses in different areas of the Sunbelt every year. Some even buy a home outright and return year after year. That’s exactly what Rick Thorpe and his wife Yasmin of Penticton, B.C., do. Come mid-October, when the weather starts to get colder and rainier, they enthusiastically pack their bags and fly south to Green Valley, Ariz., just as they’ve been doing for the past four years. The small town of 30,000 people is a 20-minute drive from Tucson and serves as a winter home to the couple and 300 other Canadian snowbirds. “My grandson always asks why we go down south for the winter,” says Rick, 67. “He says he likes the snow. I tell him I really liked snow too when I was 10 years old. But I’m not 10 any more and I think sunshine is much, much nicer.” Before buying their Green Valley home, the Thorpes spent a few winters renting properties in Palm Springs and different areas of Arizona. Then, in 2009, they fell in love with a spacious home in Green Valley and bought it for US$268,000 cash. With a paid-off Penticton home, along with Rick’s CPP and modest defined-benefit pension, the couple looked at their annual budget and decided living the snowbird lifestyle for five months of every year was doable if they planned and budgeted carefully. “Our ‘house in the sun’ as I like to call it, reminds us of our home in Penticton,” says Rick of the couple’s 1,826-sq-ft, two-bedroom Green Valley home. “In fact, the view from my back windows in both homes is similar, except that with the mountains outside my Arizona window, there’s an incredible big blue sky to go along with it every single day. You can’t beat it.” How do they do it? Among other things, Rick and Yasmin are organized. Over the years, Rick has become somewhat of an expert on many of the issues Canadian snowbirds face—preparing annual budgets, watching the value of the loonie carefully to see if this year they’ll have a favourable exchange rate and making sure they have enough travel medical insurance to make their trips carefree. If you’re wondering whether the snowbird lifestyle is right for you, read on. We ran the numbers and discovered a snowbird lifestyle can be had on just about any budget—from a super affordable $4,400 for three months in Mexico all the way up to $21,000 or more for a three-month stay in an upscale community in a U.S. southern state. See “How much extra will you need to live the snowbird lifestyle?” In all cases, you need to understand some important details, including the financial, health and tax consequences, customs, insurance and estate planning. “Every person’s situation is different and regulations and laws can change at any time,” says tax expert and author Evelyn Jacks. “You need to educate yourself and watch out for the tax traps. If you stay well informed, you’ll make the right choices.” Do your homework. Before you begin your annual trek south, find out everything you can about making your stay carefree. It can start with a simple trip to your local library or bookstore to find books on the topic. A good one to start with is The Canadian Snowbird in America, by Terry Ritchie and Brian Wruk. You should also check out the Canadian Snowbird Association website at www.snowbirds.org. The association has over 70,000 members nationwide and for a yearly membership rate of $25, you can have access to all their timely information on everything from exchange rates to bringing pets across the border. Popular Sunbelt locales with Canadians include Yuma and Tucson, Ariz.; Naples and Venice, Fla.; Palm Springs and La Quinta, Calif.; Galveston and Corpus Christi, Tex.; as well as San Miguel de Allende and San Carlos, Mexico. “Start looking in your 50s,” says Beverly Wood, 58, who with her husband Chris has spent the last two winters in San Miguel de Allende. “If not now, when? Looking is fun. You get to know a place differently when you’re planning to maybe live there.” Whatever location you ultimately choose, you’ll need to make an effort to get to know people in the community. Take full advantage of any opportunities to meet up with people in your snowbird community. Attend cookouts, picnics and go sightseeing. As well, check out local rec centres, libraries and retirement community clubs. They all offer a variety of activities, including book clubs, film nights, tennis and day trips to various areas of interest. All you have to do is drop in and ask for a list of their ongoing activities. Then register for a couple of them. Consider your budget. Make a list of the areas you can afford and draw up a rough budget. Some locations like Naples and Clearwater, Fla., and Phoenix, Ariz., have an abundance of modestly priced condo rentals at about $1,000 a month. (More luxurious accommodation in oceanfront condos can run you about $4,000 a month and up.) Check out www.extendedstayamerica.com for some of the best hotel and motel rates in snowbird locations. You can also try to negotiate a cheaper rate by phoning directly and letting them know you plan to stay four or five months. As well, try to book your flight south well ahead of time so you can take advantage of cheaper airfares and more convenient departure times. For instance, if you book 30 days prior to your departure, a return flight to Tampa, Fla., from Toronto will cost about $380 (including all taxes, surcharges and fees), often a couple of hundred dollars per person cheaper than if you book just two weeks ahead of time. The cost of driving to the Southern States is about $700 each way if you include gas, food and hotel charges for three nights. You can save a few hundred dollars by doing the drive in 20 hours or so if you have two drivers and don’t stop for overnight stays in a hotel. “We drive back and forth each year because we want to use our car when we’re south,” says Rick Thorpe. “But I did the cost analysis and it’s just as cheap to fly.” If you choose to fly, car rentals are about $20 a day and often less if you book an economy class car for an extended time. Groceries, clothes, restaurant meals and gas are about 35% cheaper south of the border. And you can pretty much find whatever you want—even in Mexico. “We have a Costco, a Walmart and Sam’s Club about half an hour away,” says Wood. “I have noticed though that here they have English products aisles and Spanish products aisles. The same box of Kellogg’s Corn Flakes will be $6 in the English aisle and $3 in the Spanish aisle. That’s a good tip to keep your costs down in Mexico.” Make sure your health care is covered. Before you leave, check with your provincial health care provider to find out your province’s residency requirements and at what rate you’ll be reimbursed for emergency care if you become ill while outside Canada. For instance, B.C. reimburses only $75 for emergency in-patient hospital care while Ontario covers up to $400 a day. While out-of-pocket costs for health care in the U.S. can run to tens of thousands of dollars if you don’t buy travel health insurance for a trip, the cost of six months of insurance is typically less than $1,000 if you have a basic $99 deductible. Make sure you shop around. One major provider to consider is Medipac Travel Insurance. Medipac will provide Ontarians with travel health insurance for up to 212 days and 183 days for people from other provinces, but you need to maintain your provincial residency and health insurance. For instance, for a 64-year-old male or female with no pre-existing health conditions who wants a policy to cover them for 183 days, the rate is $754 with a $99 deductible. It rises to $1,982 if they have pre-existing conditions, often defined as diabetes, heart problems, a prior stroke or a combination of these. “Make sure you have stable and controlled conditions before you leave to qualify for the insurance,” says Christopher Bradbury, vice-president of marketing for Medipac Travel Insurance in Toronto. “We expect to see 90 days of stability and that means no change in medication, dosage, and no treatment whatsoever of new conditions.” Update your insurance. Make sure you call your home insurance provider and let them know how long you’ll be away. To keep your home insurance active, make sure that someone will be checking on your home for damage or vandalism on at least a weekly basis. Some companies may require formal notification or payment of a premium if you drive a Canadian-registered vehicle down south in the fall or winter. The Canadian Snowbird Association suggests checking your liability limit, and ensuring a minimum $2 million of coverage. As well, you can use your vehicle in the U.S. for up to a year with Canadian licence plates and a Canadian driver’s license. If you want to leave a Canadian-registered vehicle in the U.S. for more than a year, you’ll need proper U.S. vehicle registration. Canadian automobile insurance is not applicable on a vehicle left in the U.S. on an ongoing basis, so you’ll need separate coverage from a U.S.-based insurance broker. “We shipped our van by trailer a few years ago because we fly down to Fort Myers every time we go south,” says Shirley Domelle, 64, of Toronto, an interior decorator who spends several weeks at her vacation home in Bonita Springs, Fla., every year with her husband Brian, 65. “The car has a Florida licence plate and it stays there. My husband and I both hold Florida driver’s licences as well. We found out U.S. car insurance is lower if we take the driver’s test here.” Organize your finances. Set up online banking and pre-authorized payments for bills, check expiry dates on credit cards and debit cards and notify your bank and credit-card company about where you’re going and for how long. “We pay all our bills and manage all our investments online,” says Beverly Wood. “It’s also how we stay connected to friends and family back home.” Keep a list of everything you bought in the U.S. and bring it back to Canada. Keep receipts when possible and realize that all items bought in the U.S. have to be declared. As a snowbird who has stayed longer than seven days, you can bring back items totaling up to $750 tax- and duty-free. Keep in touch with loved ones. If you have kids and grandkids you’re used to seeing several times a month, a lengthy stay south of the border can be emotionally upsetting if you don’t take some steps to maintain contact. With social media such as Facebook and Twitter, you can easily keep in touch with family while you’re away. Consider setting up a Skype account before you go. Then arrange a good time to talk to your family a couple of times a week when everyone is home. Invite family or friends down to your snowbird nest for a week or two over the holidays. Finally, send small mementos or cards in the mail a couple of times a year—especially to your grandchildren. Understand border logistics. It’s important to prove to border officials—especially American ones—that you have the means to support yourself during your stay. You can do that by bringing along recent Canadian documents like bank statements, tax return assessment notices or credit-card statements. To prove to border officials that you’re planning to return to Canada, bring a Canadian house deed or lease agreement, property tax bill, a pre-booked return ticket (if travelling by air), and U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form 8840 for non-resident aliens. (We talk about this on page 63.) Keep everything in a “border binder,” which is simply a folder that holds documents that prove you’re a Canadian resident who has every intention of returning home. “I keep copies of my tax forms, a property tax bill for my home in Canada and a credit card bill,” says Bob Slack, 70, a retired principal from Athens, Ont., who spends winters in Winter Haven, Fla., with his wife Lois, a retired schoolteacher. “It goes a long way towards explaining why I’m in the U.S. It shows I’m simply there for a visit so I’m not detained.” Most Canadian citizens are welcome to visit the U.S. for up to six months (182 days) in a rolling 12-month period. The number of allowable days doesn’t necessarily reset on January 1 just because the calendar year changed. The time is based on an individual’s travel dates, and can continue from one calendar year to the next. Every day spent in the U.S. through the year counts. It’s important not to overstay your welcome. “If you go over 182 days in any 12-month period, U.S. immigration considers you a “resident alien,” says Roy Berg, a partner at Moodys Gartner Tax Law in Calgary. “That means if you get stopped at the border you can be denied entry to the U.S. in the future. Keep it simple. Aim for 120 days or less for no tax or immigration consequences.” But in all cases, keep a calendar where you track precisely the days you spend down south. That’s for two reasons: getting the maximum days allowable without having to pay U.S. taxes, and making sure you meet the required number of days in Canada to qualify for your health insurance. (Check with your provincial health insurance provider to determine the amount of days required for your province.) “We try to keep our stay between 160 and 175 days a year to play it safe, both for tax reasons and for immigration reasons,” says Thorpe. “I also keep a detailed paper trail, including copies of hotels where I stayed, boarding passes and an itinerary so immigration sees where I’ve been and when.” Medication is also a consideration when you cross the border. “To avoid any hassle at the border, if you’re planning to take medications in the United States, take only enough for your personal use for the time you will be away,” says Terry Ritchie, co-author of The Canadian Snowbird in America. It also helps to have all your medication clearly labelled in a clear, plastic bag when you go through customs. It makes them easily accessible and visible to border agents. If you have pets, and want to bring them down south with you, you’ll want to ensure that they have all their shots—especially a rabies shot—before crossing the border with them. “We always have a recent health certificate from the veterinarian for our dogs Junior and Rosie,” says Beverly Wood. “They love San Miguel because they can be outside in the sunshine whenever they want. I think it helps keep them healthy.” Taxing issues and residency rules Canadian residents who spend part of the year in the U.S. are considered either resident aliens (183 days or more in the U.S.) or non-resident aliens (182 days or less). Resident aliens are generally taxed in the U.S. on income from all sources worldwide; non-resident aliens are taxed only on income from U.S. sources. That includes rental income, the sale or exchange of U.S. real estate, interest, dividends and annuities. Check with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service about completing and filing U.S. IRS Form 8840, Closer Connection Exemption Statement for Aliens. Also see the Canada Revenue Agency’s guide on Canadian Residents Going Down South for more details. As well, all Canadian snowbirds whose visits to the U.S. fall between 30 and 183 days in a single calendar year are subjected to something the IRS calls a “substantial presence” test. This is to see if they will be deemed to be U.S. residents for tax purposes. If they are, they will be taxed on their worldwide income in much the same way as an American citizen and they would have to file a U.S. Income Tax return. The IRS uses a formula to determine whether a Canadian visitor meets the criteria for a “substantial presence,” based on how much time they’ve spent in the country in the current year and two previous years. (You can refer to The Canadian Snowbird in America, by Ritchie for the details.) But even if you meet the substantial presence test, you can still avoid being labeled a U.S. resident for tax purposes by filing out Form 8840 with the IRS. “I always fill it out once I’ve been in the U.S. for four months in any calendar year,” says Bob Slack. “I keep track of the days I spend in the U.S. religiously and also keep a copy of Form 8840 with me when I’m crossing the border.” If you have any questions about this rule or other tax issues, consult with a cross-border tax lawyer before leaving. Run the numbers before buying property. Right now there are some great real estate deals in the U.S. and Mexico. But before buying anything, make sure you understand the laws in the country or state in which your new property resides. For instance, in some states like Florida, non-resident owners pay higher rates of property taxes than residents—sometimes several thousand dollars higher. If you opt to rent out your U.S. property, you’ll need to fill out both a U.S. tax return with the IRS, and a Canadian tax return with the CRA. In Mexico, buying a home comes with its own unique tax and ownership challenges, so hiring a lawyer or notary with experience in Mexican real estate before you buy would be a huge benefit. “Renting is a good option if you’re not comfortable with currency valuation, tax consequences or have health problems,” says tax expert Evelyn Jacks. “Owning comes with tax consequences when you sell.” As a U.S. property owner, read up on the benefits of cross-border trusts if you’re interested in passing your property down to your kids and grandkids in the most tax-efficient way possible. Estate, capital gains and U.S. withholding taxes are issues to discuss with a good tax lawyer. Leading personal finance expert and author Gordon Pape has owned a home in Florida since 1997 but sold last year. He says buying a home in the U.S. entails several unplanned expenses, including financing costs, utility payments, home insurance, condo and homeowners’ association fees, golf or athletic community membership, pool maintenance, sprinkler maintenance fees, tree trimming fees, the costs of furnishing and remodeling the home, and buying an additional car. All these expenses need to be looked at and evaluated before you make a final commitment. “There are pros and cons to every solution,” says Pape. “Taxes are an issue but frankly, I was more concerned about hurricanes and floods. Insurance for both have huge deductibles. I had two hurricanes hit my home in Florida a few years ago. In one case, we had to fix the roof, which involved a $6,000 deductible on an $11,000 claim. That’s where expenses can really add up.” The lesson? It’s important to be very careful because when you’re down there, your heart can take control of your brain,” says Rick Thorpe. “Stay focused and make a fully informed and thoughtful decision before you buy any property.” For Sandra Dare, 65, and her husband Graham of Kitchener, Ont., their passion for the snowbird lifestyle ultimately won out and they decided to buy a home for their winter stays. “We wanted a home that was maintenance-free and ready for us every time we came down, so we just bought,” says Sandra of the Florida coach home the couple purchased in 2003. “My husband and I golf, play bridge and garden. In fact, I love wintering in Florida so much that I go into withdrawal whenever we come back to Canada. There’s just not as much to do here for us and the sunny days down there really help keep us active and energized. The bottom line? Your success in living the snowbird lifestyle will depend more on what you do before you go, than after. Spend a few hundred dollars for a cross-border tax expert’s time so you can clarify any tax or immigration questions you may have in your own personal case. Then ease into it, do your research, try out different locales and most of all, make sure you’re having fun so your trip south is always a much-anticipated annual event. That’s the best way of guaranteeing that your annual trek south will leave you relaxed, refreshed—and eager to come back for more next winter.   Share: Facebook Twitter Google+ Share LinkedIn Email Advertisement Advertisement    Show comments Hide comments (16) 16 comments on “Follow the flock south” ​While planning a holiday, the first thing that one has to worry about is “booking a hotel”. If not chosen correctly, you can end up ruining the whole holiday itself. Nothing comes to rescue and ease up the painful ‘research’ one has to make for booking their perfect hotel. Everybody needs one place where they can find their dream hotel in their budget. Their are some sites available now a days which provide all information in one place summing up your constraints, like http://www.extendedstayer.com/ Reply ↓ georgegiving on January 31, 2014 at 5:58 am There are many more affordable places surrounding Phoenix and Tucson. Try a youtube search foe a Florence, AZ rental. Use that as a home base. Reply ↓ Ella Matthews on November 26, 2016 at 5:35 pm Boring. Somebody with Canadian home paid off and with more than $300,000 cash is already a “millionaire”. $4,400 for 3 months in Mexico is not “super-affordable”, you can find rentals on the coast for less than half of that, and I’m talking about entire home. $750 insurance for 6 months in the US with a coverage over 1 million and low deductible is unrealistic when you in your 70-s. There are no Costco and Walmart in Mexico unless you’re in a really big city, and budget-minded gringos don’t buy Kellog because all “gringo-food” costs double and triple compared to the US and Canada.

Shopped at Costco and Walmart in Guadalajara every week. Provincial health insurance will cover you in Mexico. No need for addition coverage except SkyMed. Gringo food in not even double. Reply ↓ JEAN on January 29, 2015 at 8:42 am Another option is to RV down there. I have been doign that for years. Maybe take a caravan the first time to learn the ropes, get over the fear factor, etc. Caravans de mexico runs long term snowbird ones (see http://www.nexicorvbuddies.com) or companies like Adventure & Fantasy do short ones. The advantage with an RV is you are not stuck in one location.

You can find details at http://www.holidayvillageassociation.com Reply ↓ Robert on June 16, 2014 at 5:37 am I would like to know how I can get my property taxes down as I am a non resident to the state of Florida. I know if you are a American your taxes are a lot lower than non residents. I am a Canadian. I am paying over 2 thousand dollars more a year than a US person. Reply ↓ mary on January 23, 2015 at 1:44 pm See my comment in answer to the American/Canadian Property tax difference. As to how to get it lowered, each annual assessment comes with information about requesting to have your taxes lowered. I’m assuming you are going to have to convince ‘them’ why you believe your house is not worth the price they have assessed it at and I have found, just like in Canada, property assessed value is always less than what I could sell the place for. Good luck. Reply ↓ Regina on February 9, 2015 at 9:01 pm I’m going to question the validity of your statement ‘in some states like Florida, non-resident owners pay higher rates of property taxes than residents’. This is simply untrue, more of a ‘rumour’ quite frankly. When I was looking for my home in FL I personally called the city of Daytona Beach to get the skimmy on property tax rules. It was explained to me and has since been proven to be true that it does not matter what country you are from, property taxes are the same for everyone. What IS true is that Florida ‘residents’ are allowed to apply to have their property taxes lowered, its a ‘tax exemption’ program based on your income in order for lower income families to afford to keep their home. You/we as a non-resident obviously do not qualify for this program and therefore the next time after your purchase, when the taxes are due for their regular annual re-evaluation the exemption would not apply to you and therefore we snowbirds pay the ‘normal’ property taxes based on the usual criteria of what your home is appraised at, school board fees, waster management, city water supply, etc. Reply ↓ Regina on February 9, 2015 at 8:54 pm $1000 a month for a condo in Phoenix? How is that affordable on a retirement income of $750? Reply ↓ Debbie on March 4, 2015 at 9:18 pm why don’t they stay there? I mean immigrate and leave the country . If Canada is so horrible why do they come back ? Reply ↓ Jo on February 8, 2016 at 12:00 pm I live in Wisconsin. I wanted to find out about visiting Arizona for a few weeks in February, This article seems to be direct at non-U.S. folks. Reply ↓ Diana on January 19, 2017 at 9:18 pm Yes Diana we are a Canadian personal finance publication so the article is aimed at Canadians Reply ↓ Prajakta Dhopade on January 20, 2017 at 11:19 am Leave a comment Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Last year, 64 officers died in the line of duty. The decade's highest total came in 2011, with 73 officers killed. Here's a look at the officers who have been killed as of January 20, 2017: FLORIDA MASTER SGT. (OFFICER) DEBRA CLAYTON Clayton, 42, was shot and killed when she tried to confront a murder suspect in the parking lot of a local Walmart in Florida on January 9. When police arrived on the scene they found the 17-year veteran dead from gunshot wounds. Officers could not revive her after performing CPR. The Orange County Sheriff's Office launched a manhunt that eventually led to the capture of Clayton's suspected shooter -- Markeith Loyd. Loyd had been on the run from authorities for nearly a month. He was wanted in connection to the fatal shooting of Sade Dixon, 24, his pregnant ex- girlfriend outside her home in the Pine Hills neighborhood on December 13, 2016, CNN affiliate WFTV reported. Loyd, 41, has been charged with two counts of murder in the deaths of Dixon and Clayton, said Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings. He also faces charges of attempted murder and aggravated assault for injuries Dixon's family member sustained in the alleged encounter. Clayton's death marks the first fatal shooting of a police officer in the US this year, according to the memorial fund. Clayton was married and the mother of a college-age son. She was promoted posthumously to lieutenant at her funeral. DEPUTY OFFICER NORMAN LEWIS Lewis, a deputy first class with the Orange County Sheriff's Office, was killed in a vehicle accident while searching for Clayton's gunman. Lewis, 34, was driving a motorcycle when another vehicle turned in front of him. He died in the crash a couple hours after Clayton was shot. The 11-year veteran in the sheriff's department, mostly worked in the traffic division. The University of Central Florida graduate played in the offensive line on the school's football team from 2000-2003 and earned his degree in criminal justice in 2004, CNN affiliate WFTV reported. NORTH DAKOTA DEPUTY SHERIFF COLT ALLERY Allery, 29, of the Rolette County Sheriff's Office, was fatally shot during a pursuit of a stolen vehicle on Wednesday. The suspect was killed and another officer was wounded in the incident, according to the memorial fund. Allery is the first officer killed in North Dakota this year, the fund said. TEXAS DETECTIVE JERRY WALKER Walker, 48, was shot and killed while responding to a 911 call about an armed man outside a home in the Dallas suburb of Little Elm on Tuesday. A standoff ensued. The suspect opened fire from inside the home striking Walker. The suspect was found dead in the home hours later. Walker was transported by helicopter to a local hospital where he later died from his injuries, police said. Walker leaves behind a wife and four children, the youngest just a few months old. The oldest is 22 years old. Copyright 2017 by CNN NewSource. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed. Trending http://www.clickondetroit.com

Photo: AP Hours after a fugitive in the slaying of a police officer told a judge he was brutalized during his arrest, the Orlando police chief released a video of his surrender and described the suspect as “extremely violent, dangerous and very unpredictable.” The nighttime aerial video shows Markeith Loyd crawling across the front yard of a house before he is surrounded by police. At least two of the officers appear to kick him as he surrenders. The camera then pans out and away, making it difficult to see anything in detail. Orlando Police Chief John Mina acknowledged that Loyd was kicked during his arrest on Tuesday, but said that was because he was resisting the officers’ orders. Loyd later appeared with both eyes swollen shut and blood oozing from his mouth. He was hospitalized overnight and then jailed before his initial appearance on Thursday. The police chief said he believes his officers acted appropriately and that all involved remain on full duty. “Let’s not rush to judgement, let’s let the use of force investigation play out and remember that we are dealing with an extremely violent, dangerous and very unpredictable person,” Mina said. Loyd directed expletive-laced outbursts at a judge during his initial hearing on Thursday on charges that he also killed his pregnant former girlfriend. He declared that many of the accusations against him are “made up,” and said he was brutalized by officers after an intense, nine-day manhunt. “They done took my eye, broke my nose, broke my jaw,” Loyd said. “I didn’t resist.” Most suspects appear with a lawyer and remain silent while the judge reads the charges in initial hearings, but Loyd said he planned to represent himself, stridently objecting to charges of first-degree murder and the unlawful killing of a fetus in the Dec. 13 death of Sade Dixon. Loyd, 41, is also accused of fatally shooting Orlando Lieutenant Debra Clayton outside a Wal-Mart while he was a fugitive from justice. Charges of first-degree murder, attempted first-degree murder, carjacking, aggravated assault and wearing a bulletproof vest while committing an offense were filed against Loyd on Thursday related to the officer’s killing. Orange County Judge Jeanette Bigney ordered Loyd held without bond. Loyd dismissed any notion of guilt and, despite being cautioned by the judge, his outbursts continued. The judge confirmed that Loyd was speaking under oath and said “everything you say is being recorded, sir.” “I’m not finished talking because y’all been making up shit the whole time,” Loyd said. Loyd then spoke in defense of three people arrested as accomplices for allegedly helping him evade arrest and, in so doing, admitted that he was at the Wal-Mart store where the officer was shot. “I have not received nothing from nobody. I was out there by myself. Nobody helped me do anything. I was in Wal-Mart by myself. Wasn’t nobody doing nothing for me,” he said. At that point, the judge interrupted him. “Sir, we are here addressing only one case,” Bigney said. The judge said another hearing would be scheduled to determine who would represent Loyd and when she finally told officers to remove him from the courtroom, Loyd turned to the judge and said: “Fuck you.” Mina also released chilling details about the police officer’s final moments. He said the Wal-Mart’s surveillance video showed Loyd initially tried to flee as Clayton approached him in the parking lot, but then pulled a handgun and fired at her. 1 2 NEXT › This story has been viewed 2218 times.

(Photo source: WLOX) GULFPORT, MS (WLOX) - The Biloxi Police Department is moving forward with its investigation into the accident involving a Gulfport police officer that claimed the life of a pedestrian on Hwy. 49 Thursday night. Biloxi Police Chief John Miller said investigators are preparing to do a complete accident reconstruction, part of which will be done at the scene. Miller said if the highway has to close for the reconstruction, it will only be for a short time. "Once you get your measurements and you know where everything is, you can do a lot of the investigation at the station, but the basics will be done out there," Miller said Friday morning. "It will be just like any other investigation. We will base everything on facts. We won’t leave a stone unturned." Miller said after the investigation is complete, the findings will be turned over to a grand jury. The fatal accident happened around 6 p.m. near the Walmart by Airport Rd. We’re told the pedestrian was walking on the highway when he was hit by the police vehicle. Witnesses said the officer involved immediately got out of the vehicle and performed CPR on the man. A witnesses said the officer was speeding and the vehicle did not have its emergency lights flashing at the time of the crash. Officials have not said how fast the officer was driving. Gulfport Police Chief Leonard Papania said he plans to hold a news conference at the police department Friday to address the situation. One subject that came up in the hours following the accident is poor lighting in the area. Many say the lighting in that area is too dim for the number of pedestrians that walk along the road there. One Facebook commenter suggested installing pedestrian activated crosswalks with flashing lights. Gulfport Councilman R. Lee Flowers said he addressed the poor lighting situation at a recent city council meeting. Harrison County Coroner Gary Hargrove said an autopsy on the body of the 54-year-old man is scheduled for Friday morning. His identity will be release once the family is notified. We will continue to follow this story throughout the day. You can find the latest details on this investigation on WLOX News Now and WLOX.com. Copyright 2017 WLOX. All rights reserved.

(WKOW) - A blind dog that nearly died after it was trapped in a van that caught fire is already back home. A car caught fire in a Walmart parking lot in Lake Geneva Wednesday night and the flames spread to other vehicles. One of those was a van where Christy, a blind, 16 year old Siberian Husky, was trapped. "I couldn't watch anymore. The officer even turned to me and said to me, John, you should probably expect the worst," owner Jon Sharkus told WISN-TV. Firefighters broke the window and grabbed Christy. They started CPR and took the dog to a nearby animal hospital. Even the veterinarians say they didn't expect Christy to survive, but she did. "It's a miracle that she's alive right now.  I'm not a believer in miracles, but it's... yeah. It was wonderful to save the dog for the family. It's a great feeling," Sharkus said. Fundraising efforts are underway to help the family pay for Christy's medical bills and to replace the van. Authorities are still investigating the cause of the fire.

Debra Clayton's death. (Orlando Sentinel, pool) Last Updated: Friday, January 20, 2017, 3:41 PM EST Video Stories Markeith Loyd makes 2nd court appearance ORLANDO --  Markeith Loyd appeared before a judge again Friday for new charges in the death of Orlando Police Lt. Debra Clayton. Additional charges filed against Markeith Loyd Loyd faces charges of first-degree murder of an LEO and attempted first-degree murder of an LEO RELATED: Orlando Police released video of Markeith Loyd arrest READ: Markeith Loyd's arrest affadavit from the Ninth Judicial Circuit (PDF) The 41-year-old is accused of fatally shooting his pregnant ex-girlfriend, Sade Dixon, on Dec. 13 and shooting Clayton on Jan. 9, when she tried to apprehend him at an Orlando Walmart. Loyd has been charged with first-degree murder of a law enforcement officer, attempted first-degree murder with a firearm of a law enforcement officer, carjacking with a firearm, aggravated assault with intent to commit a felony and possession of a bulletproof vest in commission of a felony. The new charges were filed Thursday evening. During his second court appearance of the week, Loyd was once again combative toward the judge. “Who are you?” Loyd asked the judge. “Do you have a claim against me?” Loyd interrupted the judge as she read off the new charges filed against him. “Excuse me, lady in the black dress, may I have your name please?” said Loyd. When asked if he would like a public defender, Loyd failed to answer the question, and instead, repeatedly asked the judge her name. “May I ask who your name is, ma’am? For the record please. Could you state your name, for the record please ma’am.” The judge denied Loyd bond. Loyd also appeared before a judge on Thursday for charges related to the death of his pregnant ex-girlfriend, Sade Dixon. He refused an offer for a public defender and told the judge he wanted to represent himself. On Thursday evening, additional charges were filed against Loyd, 41, for the death of Clayton. He now faces charges of first-degree murder of a law enforcement officer, attempted first-degree murder with a firearm of a law enforcement officer, carjacking with a firearm, aggravated assault with intent to commit a felony and wearing a bulletproof vest. The charges were filed hours after the Orlando Police Department released aerial video of Loyd’s capture. In the video from the OPD support helicopter, Loyd is seen crawling toward a line of officers. When Loyd reaches them, he appears to be kicked by one of the officers before the camera pans away. Orlando Police Chief John Mina held a news conference after the release of the video. He urged the public not to read too much into the camera movements. "When I first saw the camera pan away, that was concerning to me. But remember, the spotter of that helicopter, who is an OPD officer, also has a responsibility of maintaining control of what's inside the house," Mina said. Mina also said the department is investigating use-of-force to determine whether any policies were violated. Loyd was arrested Tuesday night, ending a nine-day manhunt. He is accused in the shooting death of Dixon in December and Clayton on Jan. 9.

Debra Clayton's death Markeith Loyd's 2nd appearance before judge Bigney in the murder of Lt. Debra Clayton The five new charges, which came Thursday night, include first degree murder of a law enforcement officer, attempted first degree murder and wearing a bulletproof vest. The five new charges, which came Thursday night, include first degree murder of a law enforcement officer, attempted first degree murder and wearing a bulletproof vest. Stephanie Allen and Christal Hayes Contact ReportersOrlando Sentinel Privacy Policy Markeith Loyd refused to answer a judge's questions this morning and repeatedly tried interrupting her while she read a series of charges he faces in the death of Orlando police Lt. Debra Clayton. Loyd, 41, wouldn't give his name or say if he wants a lawyer, but continued to ask Judge Jeanette Dejuras Bigney to state her name "for the record." "The lady in the black dress, can I have your name please?" Loyd asked, while talking over Bigney. This was the second day in a row Loyd appeared in front of Bigney. He had a hearing Thursday morning on charges related to the Dec. 13 shooting death of his pregnant ex-girlfriend, Sade Dixon. At Friday's hearing, Loyd had on a blue jail jumpsuit and was flanked by corrections officers. He still had a square of white gauze covering his left eye. The hearing was much shorter and expletive-free — a stark comparison to Thursday's hearing, when Loyd went on a profanity-laced rant offering a defense for his accused crimes.

To see the full, unedited, explicit video of this first appearance click here  See more videos After Loyd refused to give his name, Bigney said she recognized him from the morning before. She started reading the charges he faces, including first degree murder of a law enforcement officer, attempted first degree murder and wearing a bulletproof vest, and continued with an even tone despite Loyd's attempts to interrupt her. Loyd remains in jail on no bond. Loyd was arrested Tuesday after a massive manhunt that started Jan. 9 when Clayton was gunned down outside a Wal-Mart in Orlando. He had been wanted since Dixon's death in December and police said Loyd killed Clayton when she tried to confront him at the store. Murder victim's mother speaks after Markeith Loyd's first court appearance Murder victim Sade Dixon's mother spoke out just moments after accused killer Markeith Loyd first appeared in front of a judge. During the proceeding, Loyd cursed and yelled at the judge.   Murder victim Sade Dixon's mother spoke out just moments after accused killer Markeith Loyd first appeared in front of a judge. During the proceeding, Loyd cursed and yelled at the judge.   See more videos Police officially filed charges against him in Clayton's death Thursday evening, and he now faces a total of 10 charges related to the two incidents. At Thursday's shocking hearing, Loyd said he plans to represent himself in court and ended his rant by yelling "f--- you!" to Bigney as he was led out of the courtroom. It was the first time Loyd, who had on a green protective smock, appeared in court since he was tracked to a home in the west Orlando neighborhood of Carver Shores. Normally, defendants remain quiet during their first court appearances, but Loyd used his as an opportunity to tell his side of the story, claiming he was defending himself in Dixon's death. Though Loyd surrendered and dropped two guns, police said he resisted while they tried to arrest him, so they used force, which left his face bloodied and swollen. A helicopter video of Loyd's capture was released Thursday and appears to show officers kick Loyd at least twice. When the kicking starts, the helicopter camera suddenly pans away and zooms out. Loyd argued at his hearing that he didn't resist and crawled out to the road, where officers were waiting for him. "They done took my eye, they done broke my nose, broke my jaw, they did all this s--t," he said. "Said I resisted." Orlando police Chief John Mina held a press conference Thursday to discuss the video and announced the agency is investigating the use of force, which is customary anytime an officer uses force. Mina said Loyd was not following commands, so officers had to use force. He said his officers used "incredible restraint" and said that no one should "rush to judgment" just because the camera panned away. Mina said the investigation will take the "totality of the circumstances" into play, including Loyd's violent criminal history. "We are talking about a cold-blooded, ruthless killer who then took off and committed more crimes, attempted to kill a sheriff's deputy and also carjacked somebody," Mina said. chayes@orlandosentinel.com, @Journo_Christal or 407-420-5493 Copyright © 2017, Sun Sentinel Crime Shootings Homicide Markeith Loyd Pictures: Markeith Loyd's first court appearance Pictures: Markeith Loyd's second court appearance Markeith Loyd had same bulletproof vest police wear, new reports say Dixon's mother: 'Justice is going to prevail' in Markeith Loyd case All Sections News Sports Broward Palm Beach Entertainment Classified Obituaries 69°

More Illinois residents heading to store clinics for treatment Walgreens clinic Scott Olson / Getty Images Patient Ken Werner gives his health information to Nurse Practitioner Yana Dymarskiy before getting a flu vaccine Sept. 19, 2013, at a Walgreens health care clinic in Wheeling. Patients who have insurance coverage through their employers are using such clinics more often, according to a report from the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association. Patient Ken Werner gives his health information to Nurse Practitioner Yana Dymarskiy before getting a flu vaccine Sept. 19, 2013, at a Walgreens health care clinic in Wheeling. Patients who have insurance coverage through their employers are using such clinics more often, according to a report from the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association. (Scott Olson / Getty Images) Lisa SchenckerContact ReporterChicago Tribune Illinois residents with tender throats and agonizing earaches are increasingly heading to store clinics — not just their doctors — for treatment. Nationally, the rate of visits to retail clinics among people with Blue Cross and Blue Shield insurance almost doubled over the last five years, according to the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association. That's despite concerns from some physicians and policymakers that patients may receive better care from doctors familiar with their needs and medical histories. People with insurance through their employers drove that increase. Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Illinois — the state's largest health insurer — saw an 11.7 percent increase in the rate of retail clinic visits by patients with insurance through their employers between 2014 and 2015. The rate of visits by people with individual insurance grew much more slowly nationally — and in Illinois declined by 4.5 percent between 2014 and 2015, according to the data. Store clinics often are found in pharmacies such as Walgreens and CVS, and also can be in grocers and big-box stores like Target and Wal-Mart. Nurse practitioners often staff them, treating conditions such as bronchitis and the flu. More people are using the clinics because they're so convenient, said Dr. Stephanie Vomvouras, vice president and chief medical officer at Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Illinois. They're often open on weekends and evenings and accept walk-in appointments. Citibank ATMs to replace Chase at local Walgreens Becky Yerak Citibank ATMs will replace Chase cash dispensers at Walgreens stores in the Chicago area. Last year, Chase, which holds 22 percent of the deposits in the Chicago area, said it would sell most of its off-site ATMs, including 442 cash dispensers in local Walgreens stores, to ATM operator Cardtronics.... Citibank ATMs will replace Chase cash dispensers at Walgreens stores in the Chicago area. Last year, Chase, which holds 22 percent of the deposits in the Chicago area, said it would sell most of its off-site ATMs, including 442 cash dispensers in local Walgreens stores, to ATM operator Cardtronics.... (Becky Yerak) "The out-of-pocket cost is lower and they're just sort of an easy way to get seen for minor conditions like flu, earache, minor things of that nature," Vomvouras said. On average, a patient will pay $35 out of pocket for a visit to a retail clinic for an upper respiratory condition, compared with $37 for a doctor's office and $377 for a visit to the emergency room for the same condition, according to the report. Dr. Kaveh Safavi, head of the health practice at consulting firm Accenture, said more people are flocking to retail clinics for the same reasons they're also turning to workplace clinics and telemedicine: People are looking for the least expensive way to get care close to home and work. But in 2014, the American Academy of Pediatrics advised parents against taking their children to retail clinics, saying in a news release they "do not provide children with the high-quality, regular preventative health care children need." The academy said if parents must use retail clinics, they should consider only using clinics that have relationships with their children's pediatricians. Some physicians and policymakers say people are better off going to their doctors who know their histories and what they might need in the future. Another insurer steps back from Illinois Obamacare exchange Lisa Schencker Insurer Health Alliance Medical Plan will stop accepting new Obamacare exchange customers this week, even though open enrollment for the marketplace doesn't close until Jan. 31, the insurer announced Wednesday.

Insurer Health Alliance Medical Plan will stop accepting new Obamacare exchange customers this week, even though open enrollment for the marketplace doesn't close until Jan. 31, the insurer announced Wednesday. Despite its removal from the exchange, consumers already enrolled in Health Alliance... (Lisa Schencker) "For example, a child who presents to their (primary care physician) with an earache, could also receive a needed immunization, and an adult who sees their (primary care physician) because of a cough could also have their diabetes medication adjusted," according to a 2010 article published in the journal Health Affairs. "These ancillary but important services may be missed if a patient presents to a retail clinic." The Health Affairs article also noted that some worry the growth of retail clinics will take business from primary care doctors, undermining them financially. A 2015 report by Accenture predicted more than 2,800 retail clinics would dot the country by this year — an increase of 47 percent since 2014. CVS Health has more than 1,100 retail clinics across the country, including 56 in Illinois — and it's still expanding. CVS Health hopes ultimately to grow to 1,500 clinics, said spokeswoman Amy Lanctot. Deerfield-based Walgreens has about 400 retail clinics nationally, including 56 in the Chicago area owned and operated by Advocate Health Care. Accenture's Safavi said doctors realize that to compete with retail clinics and other health care services, they have to make their services more convenient. He said he expects retail clinics likely will evolve as well, eventually replacing nurse practitioners with medical assistants who will work with patients and convey information to doctors working remotely. Walgreens tests in-store eye exams in Chicago Lisa Schencker Walgreens has quietly joined some of its competitors in offering eye exams in stores.

(Lisa Schencker) Vomvouras, of Blue Cross, said she's taken her own kids to retail clinics for minor conditions because they're often open when her regular doctor's office is not. "They're not the end-all-be-all, and they don't meet every need and they don't replace a physician's office," Vomvouras said. "They're just another venue that people can get certain limited types of care in a time when they need it. It extends access." lschencker@chicagotribune.com Twitter @lschencker Copyright © 2017, Chicago Tribune Hospitals and Clinics Medical Research CVS Health Walgreens American Academy of Pediatrics Local CEOs fight Trump's immigration plan Chicago among worst cities for robocalls Illinois farmers hopeful about Sonny Perdue, Trump's pick for ag secretary Breaking Sports Trending Opinion Suburbs Entertainment Business Advertising 26°

Police dispatched to Wal-Mart, 201 N. Edwards Boulevard, just before 1 p.m. found a vehicle engulfed in flames that were spreading to nearby cars. That’s when they also learned a dog was trapped inside one of the burning vehicles. Kristy, a 16-year-old blind husky, was resuscitated and transported to Lake Geneva Animal Hospital, where she was treated for cardiac and respiratory arrest, said Mona Hodkiewicz, a veterinarian with the animal hospital. Kristy made a speedy recovery and was discharged late Thursday morning, Hodkiewicz said. Kristy’s owner is a disabled Lake Geneva man who was taking Kristy for a car ride, which is her favorite activity, and they had stopped at Wal-Mart, Hodkiewicz said. The cause and origin of the fire remains under investigation, but no criminal activity is suspected, according to the release. Two vehicles were a total loss and one sustained minor damage, according to the release.

Hutchinson: Give states flexibility in health care plan    Friday, 20 Jan 2017 | 6:12 AM ET | 01:46 Raising taxes on imports could pose a major problem for retail and agriculture if the Trump administration's push for fair trade causes other countries to retaliate against the United States, Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson told CNBC on Friday. "I'm concerned about it," Hutchinson said about the tax, the details of which Trump is reportedly discussing with House Republicans. "I understand the need to rebuild manufacturing in the United States, to have a tougher trade policy, but we cannot jeopardize our place in the global marketplace," the Arkansas governor told "Squawk Box." Not only would an effective tariff raise costs on goods coming into the country, but those costs would trickle down to consumers, who would see prices rise on the shelves of big retailers like Arkansas-based Wal-Mart, which import most of their products, Hutchinson said. Hutchinson said he is also concerned about the backlash it would invite from the United States' global trading partners. "In a state like Arkansas, not only do we have Wal-Mart, ... but also we have agriculture, and if you have other countries retaliating against the United States, it's going to cost us in our agricultural exports, and that retaliation is something we'd be very concerned about," he said. The governor was less worried about the effect of another part of President-elect Donald Trump's agenda, his mission to dismantle Obamacare, or the Affordable Care Act, and replace it with a better plan. "We are prepared," the governor said, emphasizing his state's readiness to transition to a more favorable health care system. But agriculture and trade remain a top concern for the governor and former congressman as he looks ahead to Trump's first 100 days. "Arkansas [is] dependent upon the global marketplace," he said. "We don't want to diminish that."

Jan 20th 2017, 12:35 PM 13,087 Views 2 Comments Share7 Tweet Email One of the stars who has endorsed the brand is Cate Blanchett. Image: Jordan Strauss/AP/Press Association Images IRISH HAIRCARE BRAND Viviscal has been sold for €150 million to a Nasdaq-listed company. Galway firm Lifes2Good has sold its suite of hair restoration supplements, shampoos and conditioners, which were carved off into a separate company in early 2015, to Dwight & Church, a New Jersey-based manufacturer of household and personal hygiene products. Fora contacted Lifes2Good for comment on the sale, but nobody was available at the time of publishing. Viviscal is Lifes2Good’s leading brand and has been endorsed by A-list celebrities like Miley Cyrus, Gwyneth Paltrow and Cate Blanchett. It is stocked in more than 25,000 stores across the United States, including major chains like Wal-Mart and Walgreens. The male version of the product, which claims to restore hair growth, has also received celebrity endorsement from Rob Kardashian. Sales Lifes2Good’s most recently filed accounts show the firm topped €50 million in sales to the end of 2015. Set up by entrepreneur and Galway Tenors singer James Murphy, the firm’s revenues swelled nearly 20% in the 12-month period. It recorded an operating profit of €3.3 million over the year and the company had accumulated profits of nearly €10 million. Lifes2Good founder James Murphy Source: YouTube In 2008, Lifes2Good acquired the branding rights to Viviscal, which was relaunched in Ireland, the UK and US that same year and was introduced to the Australian market in 2013. Other products under Lifes2Good’s wing include Petura pet care products, Micro Pedi footcare devices and Sonic Chic toothbrushes. Founded in 1997, Murphy still owns more than four-fifths of the company’s shares. Church & Dwight, which has a market value of around $11.7 billion, had revenues of $3.4 billion in 2015 and pre-tax profits of $635 million. It owns a variety of brands, including the Arm & Hammer range of toothpastes, detergents and deodorants, as well as Trojan condoms and Orajel oral pain relief products.

A judge has ruled that 38 year old Justin Barkley is mentally incompetent and not able to aid in his defense. Prosecutors say Barkley shot and killed 52 year old William Schumacher of Candor before running over him.  Barkley said he thought he was killing Donald Trump. He also held authorities at bay after the killing and fired at police at his home in Dryden. Prosecutors say they believe Barkley is just unwilling to participate in the proceedings and is competent. Barkley is being transferred to a secure New York State mental health institution. If he were to be convicted of the murder, he could serve 25 years to life in prison.     Filed Under: Candor | Dryden | Ithaca | mentally incompetent | murder | United Parcel Service Category: Crime | Local News Share on Facebook Share on Twitter More Leave a comment Send to a friend!

Debra Clayton's death marks the first gun-related police fatality of 2017 in the United States. Clayton, 42, was shot to death. Orange County Sheriff Deputy First Class Norman Lewis (right) has been identified as the officer killed in a motorcycle accident while searching for the suspect in the shooting death of collegue police officer Master Sargent Debra Clayton (left).... By Azadeh Ansari CNN (CNN) -- Four police officers have been killed in the line of duty this year, according to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund. Last year, 64 officers died in the line of duty. The decade's highest total came in 2011, with 73 officers killed. Here's a look at the officers who have been killed as of January 20, 2017: FLORIDA MASTER SGT. (OFFICER) DEBRA CLAYTON Clayton, 42, was shot and killed when she tried to confront a murder suspect in the parking lot of a local Walmart in Florida on January 9. When police arrived on the scene they found the 17-year veteran dead from gunshot wounds. Officers could not revive her after performing CPR. The Orange County Sheriff's Office launched a manhunt that eventually led to the capture of Clayton's suspected shooter -- Markeith Loyd. Loyd had been on the run from authorities for nearly a month. He was wanted in connection to the fatal shooting of Sade Dixon, 24, his pregnant ex- girlfriend outside her home in the Pine Hills neighborhood on December 13, 2016, CNN affiliate WFTV reported. Loyd, 41, has been charged with two counts of murder in the deaths of Dixon and Clayton, said Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings. He also faces charges of attempted murder and aggravated assault for injuries Dixon's family member sustained in the alleged encounter. Clayton's death marks the first fatal shooting of a police officer in the US this year, according to the memorial fund. Clayton was married and the mother of a college-age son. She was promoted posthumously to lieutenant at her funeral. DEPUTY OFFICER NORMAN LEWIS Lewis, a deputy first class with the Orange County Sheriff's Office, was killed in a vehicle accident while searching for Clayton's gunman. Lewis, 34, was driving a motorcycle when another vehicle turned in front of him. He died in the crash a couple hours after Clayton was shot. The 11-year veteran in the sheriff's department, mostly worked in the traffic division. The University of Central Florida graduate played in the offensive line on the school's football team from 2000-2003 and earned his degree in criminal justice in 2004, CNN affiliate WFTV reported. NORTH DAKOTA DEPUTY SHERIFF COLT ALLERY Allery, 29, of the Rolette County Sheriff's Office, was fatally shot during a pursuit of a stolen vehicle on Wednesday. The suspect was killed and another officer was wounded in the incident, according to the memorial fund. Allery is the first officer killed in North Dakota this year, the fund said. TEXAS DETECTIVE JERRY WALKER Walker, 48, was shot and killed while responding to a 911 call about an armed man outside a home in the Dallas suburb of Little Elm on Tuesday. A standoff ensued. The suspect opened fire from inside the home striking Walker. The suspect was found dead in the home hours later. Walker was transported by helicopter to a local hospital where he later died from his injuries, police said. Walker leaves behind a wife and four children, the youngest just a few months old. The oldest is 22 years old. CNN's Emanuella Grinberg, David Shortell and Ralph Ellis contributed to this report. TM & © 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

(Red Huber/Orlando Sentinel via AP, Pool) ORLANDO, Fla. — Hours after a fugitive in the slaying of a police officer told a judge he was brutalized during his arrest, Orlando’s police chief released a video of his surrender and described the suspect as “extremely violent, dangerous and very unpredictable.” The nighttime aerial video shows Markeith Loyd crawling across the front yard of a home before he’s surrounded by police. At least two of the officers appear to kick him as he surrenders. The camera then pans out and away, making it difficult to see anything in detail. Police Chief John Mina acknowledged that Loyd was kicked during his arrest, but said that’s because he was resisting the officers’ orders. Loyd later appeared with both eyes swollen shut and blood oozing from his mouth. He was hospitalized overnight and then jailed before his initial appearance. The chief said he believes his officers acted appropriately and that all involved remain on full duty. “Let’s not rush to judgment, let’s let the use of force investigation play out and remember that we are dealing with an extremely violent, dangerous and very unpredictable person,” he said. Loyd directed expletive-laced outbursts at a judge during his initial hearing on charges that he also killed his pregnant ex-girlfriend. He declared that many of the accusations against him are “made up,” and said he was brutalized by officers after an intense, nine-day manhunt. “They done took my eye, broke my nose, broke my jaw,” Loyd complained. “I didn’t resist.” Most suspects appear with a lawyer and remain silent while the judge reads the charges in initial hearings, but Loyd said he planned to represent himself, and stridently objected to charges of First-Degree Murder and the unlawful killing of an unborn child in the Dec. 13 death of Sade Dixon. Loyd, 41, also is accused of fatally shooting Orlando Lt. Debra Clayton outside a Wal-Mart while he was a fugitive from justice. Charges of first-degree murder, attempted first-degree murder, carjacking, aggravated assault and wearing a bulletproof vest while committing an offense were filed against Loyd related to the officer’s killing. Orange County Judge Jeanette Bigney ordered Loyd held without bond. Loyd dismissed any notion of guilt, and despite being cautioned by the judge, his outbursts continued. The judge confirmed that Loyd was speaking under oath and said “everything you say is being recorded, sir.” “I’m not finished talking because y’all been making up s— the whole time,” Loyd responded. Loyd then spoke in defense of three people arrested as accomplices for allegedly helping him evade arrest, and in so doing, admitted that he was at the Wal-Mart store where the officer was shot. “I have not received nothing from nobody. I was out there by myself. Nobody helped me do anything. I was in Wal-Mart by myself. Wasn’t nobody doing nothing for me,” he said. At that point, the judge interrupted him: “Sir, we are here addressing only one case.” The judge said another hearing will be scheduled to determine who will represent Loyd. And when she finally told officers to remove him from the courtroom, Loyd turned to the judge and said “F— you!” Mina also released chilling details about the officer’s final moments. He said the Wal-Mart’s surveillance video showed Loyd initially tried to flee as Clayton approached him in the parking lot, but then pulled a handgun and fired at her. She was shot and tried to seek cover, and Mina said Loyd could have driven away at that point. Instead, he came and stood over Loyd, shooting her several more times. The Medical Examiner found that it was one of those final shots that killed her. “We are talking about a cold-blooded, ruthless killer,” the chief said.

Last year, 64 officers died in the line of duty. The decade’s highest total came in 2011, with 73 officers killed. Here’s a look at the officers who have been killed as of January 20, 2017: FLORIDA MASTER SGT. (OFFICER) DEBRA CLAYTON Clayton, 42, was shot and killed when she tried to confront a murder suspect in the parking lot of a local Walmart in Florida on January 9. When police arrived on the scene they found the 17-year veteran dead from gunshot wounds. Officers could not revive her after performing CPR. The Orange County Sheriff’s Office launched a manhunt that eventually led to the capture of Clayton’s suspected shooter — Markeith Loyd. Loyd had been on the run from authorities for nearly a month. He was wanted in connection to the fatal shooting of Sade Dixon, 24, his pregnant ex- girlfriend outside her home in the Pine Hills neighborhood on December 13, 2016, CNN affiliate WFTV reported. Loyd, 41, has been charged with two counts of murder in the deaths of Dixon and Clayton, said Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings. He also faces charges of attempted murder and aggravated assault for injuries Dixon’s family member sustained in the alleged encounter. Clayton’s death marks the first fatal shooting of a police officer in the US this year, according to the memorial fund. Clayton was married and the mother of a college-age son. She was promoted posthumously to lieutenant at her funeral. DEPUTY OFFICER NORMAN LEWIS Lewis, a deputy first class with the Orange County Sheriff’s Office, was killed in a vehicle accident while searching for Clayton’s gunman. Lewis, 34, was driving a motorcycle when another vehicle turned in front of him. He died in the crash a couple hours after Clayton was shot. The 11-year veteran in the sheriff’s department, mostly worked in the traffic division. The University of Central Florida graduate played in the offensive line on the school’s football team from 2000-2003 and earned his degree in criminal justice in 2004, CNN affiliate WFTV reported. NORTH DAKOTA DEPUTY SHERIFF COLT ALLERY Allery, 29, of the Rolette County Sheriff’s Office, was fatally shot during a pursuit of a stolen vehicle on Wednesday. The suspect was killed and another officer was wounded in the incident, according to the memorial fund. Allery is the first officer killed in North Dakota this year, the fund said. TEXAS DETECTIVE JERRY WALKER Walker, 48, was shot and killed while responding to a 911 call about an armed man outside a home in the Dallas suburb of Little Elm on Tuesday. A standoff ensued. The suspect opened fire from inside the home striking Walker. The suspect was found dead in the home hours later. Walker was transported by helicopter to a local hospital where he later died from his injuries, police said. Walker leaves behind a wife and four children, the youngest just a few months old. The oldest is 22 years old.

Now there's nowhere for their suppliers to hide. World Resources Institute's Global Forest Watch Commodities platform alerts companies to deforestation in their supply chains. Image: WRI By Robin Hicks Monday 23 January 2017 Share this story Companies with a combined value of US$2.9 trillion have formed a data alliance to help them push deforestation out of their supply chains. A deal brokered by the World Resources Institute (WRI) at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Wednesday saw 20 of the world’s biggest corporations such as retail giants Carrefour and Walmart and snacks firms Mondelez International and Mars agree to deploy a monitoring framework to increase the transparency and traceability of the raw materials they use, such as palm oil, soy and cocoa.  The tool is an additional feature of WRI’s Global Forest Watch Commodities platform that enables companies to monitor the health of their supply chains by mapping tree cover loss, deforestation and forest fires on the concessions of their suppliers. Using the technology, firms can now plot the locations of the production mills and farms they source from, and get alerts of deforestation or fires that occur in those areas. By keeping a closer eye on supply chains, companies will find it easier to avoid the legal and reputational risks that can come from sourcing commodities from protected forest areas. The companies and organisations that have signed the deal also include Bunge, Cargill, Conservation International, Daemeter, IOI Group, the Inter-American Investment Corporation, FMO–Dutch Development Bank, National Wildlife Federation, Rainforest Alliance, Proforest and The Nature Conservancy.  The idea is for corporates to integrate forest monitoring into their core business strategy in the same way that they track commodity prices or stock markets. Big corporates are under increasing pressure from consumers and investors alike to show that the materials they use are not linked to illegal forest clearing, which has been connected to species loss, soil erosion and climate change. Agriculture accounts for more than 70 percent of tropical deforestation. “ Now is the time to use the power of IT to meet [deforestation] goals, while also generating sustainable business opportunities. That could really change the world. Andrew Steer, president and CEO, World Resources Institute Mars, Unilever, Cargill and Mondelēz are already using Global Forest Watch Commodities to assess deforestation risks in their palm oil, soy and cocoa supply chains across an area of land the size of Mexico. In a statement, Walmart said that it was committed to achieving zero net deforestation by 2020 in palm, beef, soy and pulp/paper, and WRI’s tool would be used to help meet this goal. Cargill shared that the company has partnered with WRI over the last year to establish a baseline for tree cover loss in the food and agricultural giant’s supply chains, and would be using the tool to chart its progress. The president and chief executive officer of World Resources Institute, Andrew Steer, said there was the necessary political will to combat deforestation, and now was the time to follow through on those commitments. “Now is the time to use the power of information technology to meet those goals, while also generating sustainable business opportunities. That could really change the world,” he said.

Jan. 19, 2017. (Red Huber/Orlando Sentinel via AP, Pool) ORLANDO, Florida - A suspect in a police officer’s slaying directed expletive-laced outbursts at a judge during his initial hearing Thursday on charges that he also killed his pregnant ex-girlfriend. Markeith Loyd declared that many of the accusations against him are “made up” and complained that he was roughed up even though he didn’t resist arrest following an intense manhunt. Loyd, 41, appeared with his eye bandaged and flanked by two police officers in an Orlando courtroom on charges including first-degree murder and unlawful killing of an unborn child in the December 13 death of Sade Dixon. Loyd is also accused of fatally shooting Orlando Master Sgt. Debra Clayton outside a Wal Mart while he was a fugitive from justice. He was arrested Tuesday night following a nine-day manhunt, and police said he resisted arrest and that force was used to bring him in. He was hospitalized until Wednesday night, then jailed. “They done took my eye, broke my nose, broke my jaw,” Loyd said, swearing as he described crawling out to the road to be arrested. “I didn’t resist s---. They just did that s--- and they’re trying to hide it from the news people. But I’m here right now.” Most suspects appear with a lawyer and remain silent while the judge reads the charges in these initial hearings. But Loyd said he planned to represent himself, and stridently disputed the charges. Orange County Judge Jeanette Bigney ordered Loyd held without bond. Loyd dismissed any notion of guilt in Dixon’s death. The judge cautioned him several times that the hearing wasn’t the forum for such an outburst, but he continued anyway. The judge confirmed that Loyd was speaking under oath, and said “everything you say is being recorded, sir.” “I’m not finished talking because y’all been making up s--- the whole time,” Loyd responded. Clayton was fatally shot while attempting to capture Loyd in a Wal Mart parking lot. After the officer’s shooting, police arrested three people -- Loyd’s ex-girlfriend, Jameis Slaughter; his former boss, Zarghee Mayan; and his niece, Lakensha Smith-Loyd, according to CBS affiliate WKMG -- for allegedly aiding Loyd in escaping capture after Dixon’s killing on Dec. 13. In court, Loyd defended those who were arrested as accomplices for allegedly helping him evade arrest - and placed himself at the Wal-Mart store where the officer was shot. “I have not received nothing from nobody. I was out there by myself. Nobody helped me do anything. I was in Wal-Mart by myself. Wasn’t nobody doing nothing for me.” At that point, the judge interrupted him. “Sir, we are here addressing only one case.” The judge said another hearing will be scheduled to determine who will represent Loyd. When she told officers to remove him from the courtroom, Loyd turned to the judge and said “f--- you!” © 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

For his background includes experience at just about every level of local, regional, state and federal government. And he's ready to have this state compete with all the others in a fair fight for taxpayer--and consumer--dollars. But right now the game is rigged in favor of special interests, namely online businesses. Because merchants in this state have to compete against those in others that are able to sell their goods and services effectively tax-free.

January 21, 2017 at 1:21 p.m. Leveling the Playing Field Editorial Totally missed the issue and solution. The basic problem is that sales tax has been a point of origin tax, not a point of destination. Obviously laws were put in place prior to modern day technology. Even Supreme Court ruled the burden of collection for internet sales was too high, back in 1992, before big data, GPS,and Amazon. In many cases, local sales tax may come from travelers or as a regressive tax on the poorest. The purposes of providing community services should be more the responsibility of median income residents, property owners, and commercial entities who benefit most from services. Might be surprised how many tax funded entities and employees buy via Internet, but not the poor? Historically not a level playing field. With today’s technology point of destination sales tax has to be in the conversation. Not just over the Internet, but all purchases. Also the consideration for more coverage of local services via property, income, or business taxes. Other things missing in the discussion are the reduction of state and local sales tax offset through collection of internet taxes; incentives given to companies, based in Arkansas, who sell product and services via Internet. Many times our first thoughts are building a wall. Unfortunately the Trojan Horse has already come and gone. ( permalink | suggest removal ) DoubleBlind says... January 22, 2017 at 5:39 p.m. We can't continue to be anti-competitive (i.e., Dillards) and demand taxes from commerce with out of state businesses that we won't allow to establish a brick and mortar presence here. Dry counties can't charge tax on liquor bought elsewhere yet consumed within borders. Can't have it both ways. It's extortion to demand a portion of sales on items we won't sell competively in state.

Markeith Loyd, suspected of fatally shooting a Florida police officer, attends his initial court appearance Thursday, Jan. 19, 2017, at the Orange County Jail, in Orlando, Fla. Loyd spoke out of turn and was d... By TERRANCE HARRIS Associated Press ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) - Hours after a fugitive in the slaying of a police officer told a judge he was brutalized during his arrest, Orlando's police chief released a video of his surrender and described the suspect as "extremely violent, dangerous and very unpredictable." The nighttime aerial video shows Markeith Loyd crawling across the front yard of a home before he's surrounded by police. At least two of the officers appear to kick him as he surrenders. The camera then pans out and away, making it difficult to see anything in detail. Police Chief John Mina acknowledged that Loyd was kicked during his arrest Tuesday, but said that's because he was resisting the officers' orders. Loyd later appeared with both eyes swollen shut and blood oozing from his mouth. He was hospitalized overnight and then jailed before his initial appearance Thursday. The chief said he believes his officers acted appropriately and that all involved remain on full duty. "Let's not rush to judgment, let's let the use of force investigation play out and remember that we are dealing with an extremely violent, dangerous and very unpredictable person," he said. Loyd directed expletive-laced outbursts at a judge during his initial hearing Thursday on charges that he also killed his pregnant ex-girlfriend. He declared that many of the accusations against him are "made up," and said he was brutalized by officers after an intense, nine-day manhunt. "They done took my eye, broke my nose, broke my jaw," Loyd complained. "I didn't resist." Most suspects appear with a lawyer and remain silent while the judge reads the charges in initial hearings, but Loyd said he planned to represent himself, and stridently objected to charges of first-degree murder and the unlawful killing of an unborn child in the Dec. 13 death of Sade Dixon. Loyd, 41, also is accused of fatally shooting Orlando Lt. Debra Clayton outside a Wal-Mart while he was a fugitive from justice. Charges of first-degree murder, attempted first-degree murder, carjacking, aggravated assault and wearing a bulletproof vest while committing an offense were filed against Loyd on Thursday night related to the officer's killing. Orange County Judge Jeanette Bigney ordered Loyd held without bond. Loyd dismissed any notion of guilt, and despite being cautioned by the judge, his outbursts continued. The judge confirmed that Loyd was speaking under oath and said "everything you say is being recorded, sir." "I'm not finished talking because y'all been making up s--- the whole time," Loyd responded. Loyd then spoke in defense of three people arrested as accomplices for allegedly helping him evade arrest, and in so doing, admitted that he was at the Wal-Mart store where the officer was shot. "I have not received nothing from nobody. I was out there by myself. Nobody helped me do anything. I was in Wal-Mart by myself. Wasn't nobody doing nothing for me," he said. At that point, the judge interrupted him: "Sir, we are here addressing only one case." The judge said another hearing will be scheduled to determine who will represent Loyd. And when she finally told officers to remove him from the courtroom, Loyd turned to the judge and said "F--- you!" Mina also released chilling details Thursday about the officer's final moments. He said the Wal-Mart's surveillance video showed Loyd initially tried to flee as Clayton approached him in the parking lot, but then pulled a handgun and fired at her. She was shot and tried to seek cover, and Mina said Loyd could have driven away at that point. Instead, he came and stood over Loyd, shooting her several more times. The medical examiner found that it was one of those final shots that killed her. "We are talking about a cold-blooded, ruthless killer," the chief said. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Obama’s approach to Putin has been smart. The next president has got to think hard: Do you let the bully have his room to play? It’s possible a President Trump would embark on a big military-building effort in the Western Pacific, generally throwing a few elbows, but I think he’ll take the quiet but firm approach; if he gets aggressive, it’s going to be on the economy and cyber-security.” Jamie Kirchick  Fellow, Foreign Policy Initiative; Term Member, Council on Foreign Relations “Our president has shown ignorance about how international trade works, threatening to impose tariffs with China. A lot of his voters shop at WalMart, and they buy cheap goods; when Trump says he wants Apple to make their iPhones in America, then Americans will probably have to pay something like $8,000 for an iPhone. I’m most concerned about potential nuclear conflict. Like Marco Rubio said, Trump is an erratic individual who cannot be trusted with the nuclear codes. If you’re asking practically, ‘How do I prepare for the Trump presidency?’ I think it’s better to invest in a bomb shelter than a gun.” Gene Healy  Vice President, Cato Institute “In many ways, Obama has gone further than ‘the decider’ George W. Bush in terms of expanding executive privilege. Before, presidential wars were often brief departures from a backdrop of peace. Presidential war-making is more or less constant now, taking place in secrecy. [But even with Trump in office], you don’t have anyone expressing a desire to re-limit this power.

Expert comment on the implications for business on Trump taking office  Share  Comments ByMike Scialom 04:00, 20 JAN 2017 Updated14:41, 22 JAN 2017 Business Moving in: Donald Trump (Photo: AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)  Share  Comments Get daily updates directly to your inbox + Subscribe Thank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email With Donald Trump iinstalled as 45th President of the United States of America the world is standing by for significant changes and, although the wider picture will take years to unfold, it is a presidency likely to create huge economic, social and political change. So how does the Cambridge business community view the prospects for the Trump era? Here are some views from a cross-section of stakeholders... Professor Peter Williamson Peter Williamson, honorary professor of international management at Cambridge Judge Business School: “If Trump’s policies as president follow his statements during the election campaign and set off a trade war with Asia, the result will be, to use a Trump phrase ‘bad, folks, really bad’ — not just for Asia, but the US and the rest of the world as well. “The immediate result of protectionist moves against Asia would be higher prices for American consumers — simply by virtue of the fact that there isn’t the capacity in the US or anywhere else to replace Asian suppliers (a point that huge US retailers such as Walmart have made clear). Even in the medium to long term the winners and losers would be unclear because today’s global trade is not as simple as one country selling a product, such as a car or a computer, to another. 21st Century trade involves complex global supply chains where components, modules, and intellectual property criss-cross the world, so that companies and workers around the world, including the UK, would suffer disruption from new impediments to trade. Read More Faking it: Unravelling a fake news story involving Stephen Hawking “That is even before the risks of retaliation against greater American protectionism. China, at least, says retaliation would be swift. If this were to happen if could be costly for American companies who earn substantial profits and much of their growth in China. During the first half of 2016 Apple, for example, made a quarter of its profits in China and the Chinese market accounted for almost all of its growth. When Apple’s China sales slumped in the second half, its share price fell more than 10%, wiping billions off its market value. “President Trump may feel China needs the US market more than the US needs China, but there are quite a few leading US companies that would disagree.” Michael Kitson Michael Kitson, university senior lecturer in international macroeconomics at Cambridge Judge Business School: “The conventional wisdom about Donald Trump is that his critics took him ‘literally, but not seriously’ but his supporters took him ‘seriously, but not literally’. So don’t take the offer to sort out a quick trade deal with the UK literally. His remarks are off the cuff and his tweets are not much better. "It will take many years to sort out a trade deal between two advanced countries which trade in advanced manufacturing and knowledge-intensive services. A better indicator of what Trump takes seriously is to look at who is his Washington swamp – a collection of protectionists, xenophobes and climate change deniers. It doesn’t bode well.” Kevin Duckworth Kevin Duckworth, founder and managing director, The Travel Hub Consultancy, looked at the new president in terms of a candidate taking on a new position at senior management level: “Well as part of his ‘interview’ – the campaign process – he has presented some fairly radical plans on a range of topics, well documented through his tweets. But while it is a risk making a change of any sort, change is a constant and there was always going to be a new President after Obama’s two terms: the ‘internal’ candidate didn’t get the role. Read More New University of Cambridge study questions Treasury Brexit model “More importantly, no matter what Trump has on his to-do list, especially all the things he says will happen on day one – including a new trade deal for the UK, a wall between the US and Canada – my guess is that once he sits down in the Oval office and gets stuck into the day-to-day business and reality of being President of the US, other events will take over and frankly he will not have the mind space to focus on some of his pre-election rhetoric. This is often my experience of new recruits, many of their pre-employment ideas don’t see the light of day once they get consumed with the day-to-day pressures and responsibilities. “I am not suggesting nothing will change but what I am arguing is that maybe the change will be less transformational, more orderly and less radical than some people think and that should provide all of us with some comfort." Ken Banks (Photo: David Johnson) Social entrepreneur Ken Banks: “Donald Trump’s focus on business, business, business might on the surface seem to be a good thing for a sector with the word ‘entrepreneurship’ in it, but for social entrepreneurs the next five years begin with considerable uncertainty. “Social entrepreneurs focusing on societal problems in the US might stand to gain, but the Trump Administration ‘America First’ mantra has left many working on injustices elsewhere with a future less clear. Indeed, the entire international development community is watching closely to see what Trump does with America’s considerable $30bn overseas aid budget. If funding is cut as much as many fear then the impact will be felt all the way down the food chain. “As with many aspects of the incoming US administration, all we can really do is wait and see – social entrepreneurs included.” Imko Meyenburg Imko Meyenburg, Lecturer in Economics and International Business at Anglia Ruskin University: “Trump’s position on trade is essentially protectionist, as he’s promised to expand domestic manufacturing and review existing trade deals. However, when it comes to finance, his viewpoint is less clear. While he made critical remarks about Wall Street’s influence on US politics, he also said on several occasions that he will repeal financial regulations introduced by the Obama administration. “It seems unlikely that Trump will abstain from his promised protectionism. Any UK trade deal will likely be dictated by US demands, possibly hindering the ability of local businesses to export. Financial services might flourish, however, if UK and US trade interests coincide on financial deregulation.” Dr Craig Duckworth Dr Craig Duckworth, Head of the Department of Economics and International Business at Anglia Ruskin University: “A high wall divides opinion on Donald Trump’s plans for the US Economy. On the anti-Trump side, America and the World are in for a ride back to the 1930s. Populist economics were very much the rage then. In the run up to the Great Depression, prohibitive import tariffs on industrial and consumer goods, and export chasing exchange rates, sucked demand, output and jobs from the global economy. Add to that the fiscal boost that Trump has promised (albeit to infrastructure) and the US economy could become so overheated we may see the revival of cautious monetary policy (higher interest rates) to fight the flames. That would dampen what spirit American companies currently have for long-term investment - but Trumpian economics is (its detractors argue) anything but long-term. “On the pro-Trump side of the wall, American voters have given the sleepy neoliberal consensus a wake-up call. No longer content to accept stagnant wages and daily exposure to economic risk, the American public are demanding the economic elite pay attention to their plight. On this more positive gloss, Trump’s policies will revive American manufacturing and productivity, through forcing American producers to seek domestic efficiencies - not to say a productivity increasing boost to morale that comes from blue-collar optimism. “So who is right? On which side of the wall falls the truth? It takes a brave economist to argue that there may be long-term benefit to the election of Donald Trump. On one side, most technical economists tell us the world is in peril. On the other, we are encouraged to listen to a little common sense. Perhaps it is time for the economics profession to reconsider the benefits of free trade. That it makes people richer is an article of faith for most economists. The typical Trump supporter is asking ‘When?’.” Natalie Bayfield Natalie Bayfield, chairwoman of Bayfield Training and Lecturer MPhil Real Estate Finance at the University of Cambridge: "Markets don't like uncertainty. For this reason despite the continuing strong employment and wage growth in Cambridge, housing market activity and price growth have slowed here in the months since Brexit. But where there is uncertainty there is opportunity. Brexit and Trump now leaves us in the surprising position of a co-incidentally weak pound and a comparatively more predictable foreign policy, which together will continue to attract wealthy international investors bringing capital into the premium end of the UK real estate market. Following which we might get more than we ever bargained for, who knows, Trump Towers in London by 2020?" John Rayment Finally, John Rayment, author of MisLeadership and ex-ARU lecturer, voiced wider concerns when he said: “The Earth will burn, but who thinks beyond the next election?!” Like us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter Daily Newsletter Follow @CambridgeNewsUK Subscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribe Comments Show more comments More On Apple Twitter Barack Obama In The News Business all Most Read Most Recent In The NewsA prescription for success in the music business PR duo prove 'if your heart's in it, you're more likely to win it' European Union'Our chance to finish the Thatcher revolution': The Great Brexit Swindle reviewed Expectations were low on first encounter with The Innovation Manifesto: it looks like a “how-to” business guide, a genre I tend to avoid (I’ve started two businesses and learning as you go along is part of the fun).

Loyd was captured Tuesday evening, sustained injuries and transported to receive medical attention Orlando Regional Medical Center and moved to Corrections facility Wednesday evening. Orlando Police Master Lt. Debra Clayton, 42, was shot by suspect Markeith Loyd outside a Walmart store last week in west Orlando. (Red Huber/Orlando Sentinel/TNS) ORLANDO, Fla. – Hours after a fugitive in the slaying of a police officer told a judge he was brutalized during his arrest, Orlando’s police chief released a video of his surrender and described the suspect as “extremely violent, dangerous and very unpredictable.” The nighttime aerial video shows Markeith Loyd crawling across the front yard of a home before he’s surrounded by police. At least two of the officers appear to kick him as he surrenders. Police Chief John Mina acknowledged that Loyd was kicked during his arrest Tuesday, but said that’s because he was resisting the officers’ orders. Loyd later appeared with both eyes swollen shut and blood oozing from his mouth. He was hospitalized overnight and then jailed before his initial appearance Thursday. The chief said he believes his officers acted appropriately and that all involved remain on full duty. “Let’s not rush to judgment, let’s let the use of force investigation play out and remember that we are dealing with an extremely violent, dangerous and very unpredictable person,” he said. Loyd directed expletive-laced outbursts at a judge during his initial hearing Thursday on charges that he also killed his pregnant ex-girlfriend. He objected to charges of first-degree murder and the unlawful killing of an unborn child in the Dec. 13 death of Sade Dixon. Loyd, 41, also is accused of fatally shooting Orlando Lt. Debra Clayton outside a Wal-Mart while he was a fugitive from justice. Charges of first-degree murder, attempted first-degree murder, carjacking, aggravated assault were filed against Loyd on Thursday night related to the officer’s killing. Orange County Judge Jeanette Bigney ordered Loyd held without bond. Loyd dismissed any notion of guilt, and despite being cautioned by the judge, his outbursts continued. The judge confirmed that Loyd was speaking under oath and said “everything you say is being recorded, sir.” “I’m not finished talking because y’all been making up s– the whole time,” Loyd responded. Loyd then spoke in defense of three people arrested as accomplices for allegedly helping him evade arrest, and in so doing, admitted that he was at the Wal-Mart store where the officer was shot. “I have not received nothing from nobody_ I was out there by myself. Nobody helped me do anything. I was in Wal-Mart by myself. Wasn’t nobody doing nothing for me,” he said. At that point, the judge interrupted him: “Sir, we are here addressing only one case.” The judge said another hearing will be scheduled to determine who will represent Loyd. And when she finally told officers to remove him from the courtroom, Loyd turned to the judge and said “F– you!” Mina also released chilling details Thursday about the officer’s final moments. He said the Wal-Mart’s surveillance video showed Loyd initially tried to flee as Clayton approached him in the parking lot, but then pulled a handgun and fired at her. She was shot and tried to seek cover, and Mina said Loyd could have driven away at that point. Instead, he came and stood over Loyd, shooting her several more times. The medical examiner found that it was one of those final shots that killed her. “We are talking about a cold-blooded, ruthless killer,” the chief said. Stay Informed.

Festival of the Arts | NFL Pro Bowl Suspect in officer's slaying spews expletives at judge By TERRANCE HARRIS, Last Updated: Thursday, January 19, 2017 ORLANDO, Fla. --  (AP) Hours after a fugitive in the slaying of a police officer told a judge he was brutalized during his arrest, Orlando's police chief released a video of his surrender and described the suspect as "extremely violent, dangerous and very unpredictable." The nighttime aerial video shows Markeith Loyd crawling across the front yard of a home before he's surrounded by police. At least two of the officers appear to kick him as he surrenders. The camera then pans out and away, making it difficult to see anything in detail. Police Chief John Mina acknowledged that Loyd was kicked during his arrest Tuesday, but said that's because he was resisting the officers' orders. Loyd later appeared with both eyes swollen shut and blood oozing from his mouth. He was hospitalized overnight and then jailed before his initial appearance Thursday. The chief said he believes his officers acted appropriately and that all involved remain on full duty. "Let's not rush to judgment, let's let the use of force investigation play out and remember that we are dealing with an extremely violent, dangerous and very unpredictable person," he said. Loyd directed expletive-laced outbursts at a judge during his initial hearing Thursday on charges that he also killed his pregnant ex-girlfriend. He declared that many of the accusations against him are "made up," and said he was brutalized by officers after an intense, nine-day manhunt. "They done took my eye, broke my nose, broke my jaw," Loyd complained. "I didn't resist." Most suspects appear with a lawyer and remain silent while the judge reads the charges in initial hearings, but Loyd said he planned to represent himself, and stridently objected to charges of first-degree murder and the unlawful killing of an unborn child in the Dec. 13 death of Sade Dixon. Loyd, 41, also is accused of fatally shooting Orlando Lt. Debra Clayton outside a Wal-Mart while he was a fugitive from justice. Charges of first-degree murder, attempted first-degree murder, carjacking, aggravated assault and wearing a bulletproof vest while committing an offense were filed against Loyd on Thursday night related to the officer's killing. Orange County Judge Jeanette Bigney ordered Loyd held without bond. Loyd dismissed any notion of guilt, and despite being cautioned by the judge, his outbursts continued. The judge confirmed that Loyd was speaking under oath and said "everything you say is being recorded, sir." "I'm not finished talking because y'all been making up s--- the whole time," Loyd responded. Loyd then spoke in defense of three people arrested as accomplices for allegedly helping him evade arrest, and in so doing, admitted that he was at the Wal-Mart store where the officer was shot. "I have not received nothing from nobody. I was out there by myself. Nobody helped me do anything. I was in Wal-Mart by myself. Wasn't nobody doing nothing for me," he said. At that point, the judge interrupted him: "Sir, we are here addressing only one case." The judge said another hearing will be scheduled to determine who will represent Loyd. And when she finally told officers to remove him from the courtroom, Loyd turned to the judge and said "F--- you!" Mina also released chilling details Thursday about the officer's final moments. He said the Wal-Mart's surveillance video showed Loyd initially tried to flee as Clayton approached him in the parking lot, but then pulled a handgun and fired at her. She was shot and tried to seek cover, and Mina said Loyd could have driven away at that point. Instead, he came and stood over Loyd, shooting her several more times. The medical examiner found that it was one of those final shots that killed her. "We are talking about a cold-blooded, ruthless killer," the chief said. Copyright 2017 Associated Press.

(Jonathan Brady/PA Wire/PA Images) BY Nancy Dillon NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday, January 19, 2017, 8:09 PM LOS ANGELES — Hysteria-inducing Hatchimals aren't all they're cracked up to be, a new class action lawsuit filed by a California mom claims. Jodie Hejduk says in her new U.S. District Court filing she paid $50 for the wildly popular children's toy at a Wal-Mart store earlier this month and gave it to her daughter as a birthday present. The Bakersfield resident says her daughter was "delighted" at first to receive the plush animal stuffed inside an egg-like shell but ended up "dismayed" when it ultimately failed to hatch. The little girl applied her "loving touch" as instructed but got no love in return, the lawsuit filed Thursday states. Parents mortified to find ‘Sophie the Giraffe’ toys full of mold "Like many other consumers, plaintiff purchased a defective product that deprived her daughter of the key attraction of the toy: the hatching," the paperwork states. Hejduk and her lawyer Mark Geragos believe hundreds of thousands of consumers who purchased Hatchimals from retailers and auction websites during the holiday gift-giving season and beyond likely experienced similar problems. "Instead of being called Hatchimals, these should be called Bait-and-Switchables," Geragos told the Daily News. He said parent company Spin Master "had to have known" the product was a problem. Parents enraged over the in-demand holiday gift Hatchimals Hatchimals was the hottest gift during the 2016 holiday season. "If they did any quality assurance testing at all, they would have known they were a complete bust," he said. "These weren't cheap. They ran $50 to $300. Then imagine a kid spending an hour petting this thing only to have it fail?" he said. "Damages could be upwards of a billion dollars." The lawsuit accuses Spin Master of false advertising, breach of warranty and unjust enrichment. It's seeking real and punitive damages to be decided at trial. Spin Master did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. ‘Water for Elephants’ author desperate to sell 156 Hatchimals In an online message to consumers that followed a wave of post-holiday complaints, Spin Master acknowledged some customers "encountered challenges." "We are 100% committed to bringing the magic of Hatchimals to all of our consumers. To ensure all queries receive a timely response, we have increased the number of Consumer Care representatives, extended our hours, and increased the capacity for callers in the queue to help prevent calls dropped due to the holiday volume," the posting said. The new lawsuit said the response amounted to "token remedial measures.” Tags: toys california lawsuits Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation: facebook Tweet Get Daily News stories, delivered to your inbox.

(Jonathan Brady/PA Wire/PA Images) BY Nancy Dillon NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday, January 19, 2017, 8:09 PM LOS ANGELES — Hysteria-inducing Hatchimals aren't all they're cracked up to be, a new class action lawsuit filed by a California mom claims. Jodie Hejduk says in her new U.S. District Court filing she paid $50 for the wildly popular children's toy at a Wal-Mart store earlier this month and gave it to her daughter as a birthday present. The Bakersfield resident says her daughter was "delighted" at first to receive the plush animal stuffed inside an egg-like shell but ended up "dismayed" when it ultimately failed to hatch. The little girl applied her "loving touch" as instructed but got no love in return, the lawsuit filed Thursday states. Parents mortified to find ‘Sophie the Giraffe’ toys full of mold "Like many other consumers, plaintiff purchased a defective product that deprived her daughter of the key attraction of the toy: the hatching," the paperwork states. Hejduk and her lawyer Mark Geragos believe hundreds of thousands of consumers who purchased Hatchimals from retailers and auction websites during the holiday gift-giving season and beyond likely experienced similar problems. "Instead of being called Hatchimals, these should be called Bait-and-Switchables," Geragos told the Daily News. He said parent company Spin Master "had to have known" the product was a problem. Parents enraged over the in-demand holiday gift Hatchimals Hatchimals was the hottest gift during the 2016 holiday season. "If they did any quality assurance testing at all, they would have known they were a complete bust," he said. "These weren't cheap. They ran $50 to $300. Then imagine a kid spending an hour petting this thing only to have it fail?" he said. "Damages could be upwards of a billion dollars." The lawsuit accuses Spin Master of false advertising, breach of warranty and unjust enrichment. It's seeking real and punitive damages to be decided at trial. Spin Master did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. ‘Water for Elephants’ author desperate to sell 156 Hatchimals In an online message to consumers that followed a wave of post-holiday complaints, Spin Master acknowledged some customers "encountered challenges." "We are 100% committed to bringing the magic of Hatchimals to all of our consumers. To ensure all queries receive a timely response, we have increased the number of Consumer Care representatives, extended our hours, and increased the capacity for callers in the queue to help prevent calls dropped due to the holiday volume," the posting said. The new lawsuit said the response amounted to "token remedial measures.” Tags: toys california lawsuits Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation: facebook Tweet Get Daily News stories, delivered to your inbox.

Loyd spoke out of turn and was defiant during the appearance on charges of killing his pregnant ex-girlfriend. He was injured during his arrest Tuesday night following a weeklong manhunt. (Red Huber/Orlando Sentinel via AP, Pool) ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — Hours after a fugitive in the slaying of a police officer told a judge he was brutalized during his arrest, Orlando's police chief released a video of his surrender and described the suspect as "extremely violent, dangerous and very unpredictable." The nighttime aerial video shows Markeith Loyd crawling across the front yard of a home before he's surrounded by police. At least two of the officers appear to kick him as he surrenders. The camera then pans out and away, making it difficult to see anything in detail. Police Chief John Mina acknowledged that Loyd was kicked during his arrest Tuesday, but said that's because he was resisting the officers' orders. Loyd later appeared with both eyes swollen shut and blood oozing from his mouth. He was hospitalized overnight and then jailed before his initial appearance Thursday. The chief said he believes his officers acted appropriately and that all involved remain on full duty. "Let's not rush to judgment, let's let the use of force investigation play out and remember that we are dealing with an extremely violent, dangerous and very unpredictable person," he said. Loyd directed expletive-laced outbursts at a judge during his initial hearing Thursday on charges that he also killed his pregnant ex-girlfriend. He declared that many of the accusations against him are "made up," and said he was brutalized by officers after an intense, nine-day manhunt. "They done took my eye, broke my nose, broke my jaw," Loyd complained. "I didn't resist." Most suspects appear with a lawyer and remain silent while the judge reads the charges in initial hearings, but Loyd said he planned to represent himself, and stridently objected to charges of first-degree murder and the unlawful killing of an unborn child in the Dec. 13 death of Sade Dixon. Loyd, 41, also is accused of fatally shooting Orlando Lt. Debra Clayton outside a Wal-Mart while he was a fugitive from justice. Charges of first-degree murder, attempted first-degree murder, carjacking, aggravated assault and wearing a bulletproof vest while committing an offense were filed against Loyd on Thursday night related to the officer's killing. Orange County Judge Jeanette Bigney ordered Loyd held without bond. Loyd dismissed any notion of guilt, and despite being cautioned by the judge, his outbursts continued. The judge confirmed that Loyd was speaking under oath and said "everything you say is being recorded, sir." "I'm not finished talking because y'all been making up s--- the whole time," Loyd responded. Get news headlines sent daily to your inbox Sign Up! I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site consitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy. Loyd then spoke in defense of three people arrested as accomplices for allegedly helping him evade arrest, and in so doing, admitted that he was at the Wal-Mart store where the officer was shot. "I have not received nothing from nobody. I was out there by myself. Nobody helped me do anything. I was in Wal-Mart by myself. Wasn't nobody doing nothing for me," he said. At that point, the judge interrupted him: "Sir, we are here addressing only one case." The judge said another hearing will be scheduled to determine who will represent Loyd. And when she finally told officers to remove him from the courtroom, Loyd turned to the judge and said "F--- you!" Mina also released chilling details Thursday about the officer's final moments. He said the Wal-Mart's surveillance video showed Loyd initially tried to flee as Clayton approached him in the parking lot, but then pulled a handgun and fired at her. She was shot and tried to seek cover, and Mina said Loyd could have driven away at that point. Instead, he came and stood over Loyd, shooting her several more times. The medical examiner found that it was one of those final shots that killed her. "We are talking about a cold-blooded, ruthless killer," the chief said.

(AP Photo/Paul Sakuma, File) FILE - This Oct. 18, 2010 file photo shows an Amazon.com package on a UPS truck in Palo Alto, Calif. Amazon and Hachette announced a multiyear agreement Thursday, Nov. 13, 2014, ending one of publishing's nastiest, most high-profile conflicts. (AP Photo/Paul Sakuma, File) Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (1) The Utah State Tax Commission announced a deal last month to get Amazon to collect taxes on sales to Utahns, but what does it really mean to Utah's bottom line? Not even the tax commission can tell you. So what exactly did the state sign off on to get Amazon to do it? That the tax commission knows, but it's still not going to tell you. On the surface, it's hard to believe the agreement would be a loser for Utah. Amazon is said to generate about one-fifth of the taxable sales taking place on the internet. By getting them to collect and remit taxes on their share of those sales, state revenues appear certain to grow. VIDEOS TOP JOBS But how much will they grow? The people at the tax commission want to see what flows in over the next few months before making any predictions. Gov. Gary Herbert and others have tossed around the figure of $200 million as the annual amount of uncollected sales tax from internet purchases, but that's an old and not necessarily reliable number. Yes, online sales are climbing, but so is the percentage of sales to companies like Target and WalMart that also have brick-and-mortar stores in Utah and therefore already must collect sales tax. And there is some question as to whether Amazon will become a brick-and-mortar player here, too. The company recently opened a test store in Seattle with no cashiers or checkout lines, just a scanner that detects what customers leave with and bills them accordingly. If Utah were to get one of those Amazon stores, then the company would be required to collect sales tax on all of its sales anyway, including internet sales. So that elevates the question of what the state gave up in the deal. The tax commission this week denied a records request from the Libertas Institute to release the terms of the agreement, saying it would give an undue advantage to Amazon's competitors. All the tax commission will say is that Amazon is getting the same deal any other retailer gets. Retailers get to keep 1.31 percent of the roughly 7 percent they collect as compensation for collecting the taxes. That may bring some satisfaction that Amazon isn't getting a bigger cut than local businesses, but it still leaves open the question of what the state gave them instead. It may not have been much. Amazon already collects sales tax in more than 30 states. On Jan. 1, Nebraska and Iowa joined Utah in that group, and it doesn't sound like it was a hard deal to make. "Honestly, Amazon contacted us and agreed to do this," said Victoria Daniels, spokeswoman for the Iowa Department of Revenue, told the Cedar Rapids Gazette in December. So what could be in the Utah agreement that would cost Amazon a competitive advantage? Is it Amazon's secrets that we're hiding, or Utah's?   Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY VIEW PHOTO GALLERY JOIN THE DISCUSSION     Post a Comment POPULAR OPINION Garrison Keillor: Help us, GOP, you're our only hope Comments: Bagley Cartoon: This Land Was Our Land Dana Milbank: Don't get distracted by Trump's 'dead cats' Bagley Cartoon: Trump's America Editorial: 'Sanctuary' SLC makes right call on immigration enforcement George F.

Such it is with the bricks and mortar retail industry. The determinant of the health of that part of the retailing sector is how well it performs during the Holiday season. For 2016, continuing the increasingly dismal trend of the past few years, the news was very, very bad. As a result, retail chains such as Macy’s, Kohl’s, Walmart and The Limited have announced partial or complete closures of their “brick and mortar” operations. Despite this, the totality of holiday was up significantly over a year earlier. Once again, a momentum has developed, but, in this case, it is for online purchasing. In this environment, what is the thinking behind the desire of the City of Redondo Beach to make a long, long, long term bet on the future of retail as the primary use for its most perishable commodity, its shoreline? However one feels about the aesthetics of The Waterfront, as the development project is called, there is no logical reasoning from a business perspective which indicates that this is a proper, permanent long-term use of this resource. The City already has experience with failed shoreline initiatives. The area above the parking garage, known by various names, some of them printable, was to be an example of how to expand the use of the waterfront in ways that would benefit the City and blend with the surrounding residential infrastructure. It was an immediate failure. In fact, at one point in the early 1990’s, the City had an opportunity to purchase the site for about $1 million and passed on it. That was how far this property’s value had fallen. There were numerous reasons for this failure, but one of the most important lessons that must be learned is that the permanence of that misbegotten development made it nearly impossible for the City to deal with essential day-to-day activities which involve the health and safety of visitors to the Pier area. Specifically, I mean the parking garage upon which this development sits. “Creative destruction” is a term coined by an economist, Joseph Schumpeter, which defines the process by which new industries rise to replace old ones. We are going through the start of that period right now in retail. It is gaining momentum. It is going to continue. It is imperative that, if the City Council doesn’t see the error of its ways, the people must tell them to see it. By turning our waterfront into a museum for a formerly successful means of selling goods, the value of that priceless area of our City diminishes to the point of worthlessness. It will be of no value to the future of our City to have a group of aesthetically pleasing, empty buildings. As we have seen, fixing a mistake of this magnitude is exceedingly difficult. It is better to have not made that egregious mistake in the first place. comments so far.

Login Here to Read More... Did you know? For just $0.75 you can get full site access today. Click Here There was a time when we had dress codes. Schools still have them, as do some businesses. Apparently, these don’t apply to box-store shoppers, who sometimes walk around in their pajamas while filling their carts. As high school government teacher Vic Calcote explained when the topic of dress codes came up in class: “You wouldn’t want a guy who hasn’t had a bath in a month to sit next to you in class without a shirt and his hands on his head.” We had some interesting conversations in that government class that had little to do with government. But one could argue that a school dress code is somewhat like a government regulation. My first experience with a dress code was during my eighth-grade year at Abilene Junior High School. Being a golfer, I was more of a (sometimes pink) polo shirt, white pants, black belt dresser. It took a lot of courage to wear pink back then. According to attireclub.org, “Pink is a color that, throughout the 20th century and apparently in the beginning of the 21st century, too, has been strongly associated with the idea of ‘girliness.’ ” I guess, as a 13-year-old, I wasn’t influenced by social mores, and not much has changed 47 years later. I have been threatening to show off my legs by coming to the Journal morning meeting in a skirt. One spring day in 1970, I showed up to class in pastel bell-bottoms. Bell-bottoms are slacks or jeans that have a flair at the bottom, a bell-like shape, made popular by sailors. Mine looked like something Johnny Miller wore the year he became a professional golfer. One would have thought I was the guy who hadn’t bathed in a month and went to school with no shirt, or that I was wearing a skirt. I was instructed to “never wear them to school again” by one of the teachers. (Like I was trying to impress Tim Gunn.) By the fall of 1970, bell-bottoms were hip and cool. Pictures come to mind of Sonny and Cher, and of John Travolta in “Saturday Night Fever.” A similar humiliating incident happened many years later when my daughter Robin, at 13, attended Abilene Middle School. She was actually sent home to change because her skort, a combination of shorts and a skirt, was too short. The irony is that the outfit was given to her by her grandmother, who was the clerk of the school board at the time. I interviewed for a job once dressed in nice slacks and a dress shirt but without a tie. It was the attire I was accustomed to working in. Mistake. Back in 1980, a tie was required at that particular newspaper. Times have changed. Search “Wacky pictures at Walmart.” I really like the woman wearing a bed sheet, not to be confused with a real toga. Do they still enforce “No shoes, no shirt, no service?” Sen. Jerry Moran, who visited Salina last week and always wears a coat and tie, commented on how difficult it is to buy men’s formal clothing in locally owned stores. It has become more difficult to dress to the nines now that Headley’s Clothing, which used to be on South Ninth Street, has closed. Schools still have dress codes so that appearance does not present a physical danger and shall be neither obscene, indecent nor immoral. Salina’s school dress code also prohibits students from showing their underwear. That’s not a bad thing, at least until the sagging pants fad has faded. — Reporter Tim Horan can be reached at 822-1422 or by email at thoran@salina.com.

Josh Bromen said. The crash occurred about 6 p.m. just north of Airport Road, Bromen said. The Biloxi Police Department and Harrison County Coroner Gary Hargrove are taking the lead on the investigation, Bromen said. Hargrove was not immediately available to identify the pedestrian, or say whether it was a man or woman. Officials removed the body from the accident scene about 7:30 p.m. An evidence marker was placed next to a single shoe in the road about 30 feet north of where the body lay. Dozens of Gulfport police and fire vehicles were at the accident. A heavy rainstorm hit the area about the time the person was hit, but details about how the accident occurred are still uncertain. Several officers were working with accident-reconstruction devices. Witnesses coming out of the Wal-Mart store, more than 200 yards to the east of the accident, said they heard an impact. “We were leaving the Wal-Mart,” Nicole Pearson said, “and we heard what sounded like a large bang, a ‘Ka-boom.’ I thought it was two cars, just a bad wreck. When I got closer I saw the police.” Bromen said the department has contacted the District Attorney’s Office. Both north- and southbound lanes of 49 between Airport Road and Creosote Road were still shut down at 9 p.m. The Sun Herald will have more information as soon as it becomes available.

Photo by David Carson, dcarson@post-dispatch.com Jesse Bogan, St. Louis Post-Dispatch The Rev. Steven F. Poole is a priest in the Belleville Diocese. Photo by Jesse Bogan, jbogan@post-dispatch.com OKAWVILLE, Ill. • The Rev. Steven F. Poole is a rank-and-file priest with his own demons, including a history of theft and a rocky relationship with church hierarchy. Now the troubled priest has broken from tradition by calling out his boss and openly accusing a fellow priest of sexually abusing him as a 14-year-old boy. Echoing the core complaints of sex abuse scandals that have shaken the church, Poole alleges that the leader of the Belleville Diocese has mishandled and disregarded his complaint, allowing the now retired priest to continue in good standing. “This is difficult because I truly do believe in the sacred bond between a bishop and his priests as co-workers in the vineyard of the Lord,” Poole, 48, wrote in an email last year to Bishop Edward Braxton, who oversees all the Roman Catholic churches in Southern Illinois. “I realize that my words will probably make no difference to you based upon prior experience. However, it is important for me to set this out to attempt to clear my conscience.” The five-page letter, along with additional correspondence obtained by the Post-Dispatch, chronicles an effort by Poole over multiple years to trigger action by the diocese. The diocese, in turn, says in a written statement sent to the newspaper Thursday that it has thoroughly and properly responded to Poole’s allegations. Braxton declined to respond to a request for comment. The diocese said its internal review board and office of child protection as well as state authorities reviewed “this situation on numerous occasions.” “Several steps were originally taken under Bishop [Wilton] Gregory and more recently under Bishop Braxton. As always, the first and most important consideration is to insure the protection of minors. The Bishop must also be aware of and concerned with the health and well-being of the individuals involved; those considerations must remain confidential.” The accused priest — the Rev. Albert “Gene” Kreher — acknowledged in an interview this week that his behavior with Poole was inappropriate when Poole was a teenager, but said there was nothing sexual about the situation. He has never faced criminal charges or a civil lawsuit. “I have had a lot of youth in my life but none needed to feel threatened,” Kreher, 78, said by telephone. “I thought I was being a good pastor trying to serve as a role model. If my erotic inclinations were turned loose they would not be directed toward young people.” In hindsight, Kreher said, Poole needed somebody else to help him as a struggling boy. Poole “needed a psychologist, professional help, which I am not,” Kreher said. A 2010 letter Kreher wrote to Poole offered a different, less specific apology. “I acknowledge that parts of my relationship with you were very inappropriate and then to be repeated over a long period of time only adds to the shame,” he wrote, according to a copy of the letter. “I am sorry that I didn’t offer my apology a long time ago and regret the possibility that things I did a long time ago contribute to your present difficulties.” Asked about the apology letter, Kreher said: “The Bishop [Braxton] was telling me in part what to write. So I could not tell you what parts ended up in the letter itself.” Asked about the reference to “shame,” he said: “That part I really don’t remember because it was not a shameful relationship.” ‘I kept it secret’ Poole described his side of the story and current struggles in a long interview this week. He said Kreher befriended him in the early 1980s, when he was 14 and his parents were struggling to stay together. Poole said he became an altar boy and helped cut the grass at St. George Church in New Baden, where Poole grew up, 30 minutes east of St. Louis on Interstate 64. Poole said he eventually started spending weekends with the priest, sleeping naked with him in the rectory and while on camping trips. “He would hold me,” Poole said. “He would fondle me, kiss me and rub his genitals on me. He would tell me he loved me while he was doing those things. I was a boy, looking for a father figure.” He said the relationship confused him. After about a year and a half, Poole said, he drifted away from Kreher. “I began to want to hang around kids my own age,” Poole said. The priest “became very jealous. He said I was being disloyal. I withdrew from his bed. I couldn’t take it anymore.” “I was ashamed,” he added. “I kept it secret for years and years and years.” Poole said he reported the alleged abuse to another priest in the early 1990s and didn’t immediately hear anything back about it. While in college, he decided to pursue the priesthood. “In spite of him, I still wanted to be a priest,” Poole said. In 1997, one year after being ordained, Poole said, he received a call from the vicar general asking about the old allegations. “I minimalized it and really denied” the allegations,” Poole said, adding that he was caught off guard by the call. “It scared me because it brought up a lot of bad memories and I wasn’t psychologically prepared to deal with it yet. I probably should have.” Though he works in the same diocese, he said he hadn’t spoken to Kreher since his mother’s funeral in 2000. His mother, a devout Catholic, had been very close to Kreher and often had him over for meals. Now at 48, Poole says he is about the same age as Kreher was when their relationship began. “I am a middle-aged pastor today,” Poole said. “Sleeping with a 14-year-old boy is not what a pastor does.” ‘A lot of shame’ Poole’s career as a priest started to implode after his mother died of cancer 17 years ago. He said he took care of her in her final months. Not long after her death, he was sentenced to probation and 100 hours of community service for stealing a large antique sign from an art gallery in Ladue in the middle of the afternoon. He also told police that he’d made up a story about a stranger trying to attack and rob him at a church in Breese. In 2010, he was accused of stealing butter and switching a bar code tag on a mattress at Walmart. In 2011, he was arrested for taking an antique ashtray, the same year he was in detox for addiction to a prescription medication. “I know people might say this is psychobabble,” Poole said. “I am not blaming my problems and laying them at the foot of what happened to me as a kid, but I think that had something to do with it. I was really confused at that stage and I was very vulnerable — an adult priest that I trusted used me and that turned into a lot of shame.” Poole said parts of his abuse story started to come out during years of therapy and counseling. He said he told Braxton specifically about the alleged abuse in a private meeting on Easter in 2010. Poole said he was disheartened by Braxton’s response, which he said wasn’t apologetic. Instead, he said, Braxton placed some of the burden of reconciliation on Poole by suggesting that he possibly sit down and confront his alleged abuser face to face. The following month, Poole received the apology letter from Kreher which began: “I have delayed far too long to deal with something critical for both of us. I need to apologize very deeply for my commissions and omissions from years ago. Whatever my intentions, I did not do right by you.” ‘Investigated and resolved’ More recently, Poole has been struggling with Braxton over how to best handle two churches he’s been responsible for since 2014: St. Barbara’s in Okawville, and St. Anthony’s, in tiny Lively Grove. In a recent letter to Braxton, Poole mentioned disagreements on how to handle what “seemed to be some financial irregularities and practices at both parishes” that came to Poole’s attention. Poole wrote that the bishop wasn’t supporting him while some lay leaders at St. Anthony’s had grown vocal about not wanting Poole’s services as a priest. He also said parish leaders had rejected his efforts to have St. Anthony’s partner with St. Barbara’s. The rural parishes, and many other parishes in the diocese, face the reality of having fewer priests these days to staff remote congregations. Many resist attempts to merge. “The difficulties have reached the point where I have received threats of physical harm,” wrote Poole, wondering why his request to be reassigned wasn’t honored. Poole told Braxton in the letter that his inaction paralleled the handling of the old sex abuse claims. Braxton responded in a March 17, 2016, letter to Poole: “I remember well the very serious matter we discussed in my Residence six years ago. Contrary to your statement, your allegations were reported to the Review Board, thoroughly investigated and resolved. I do not see the parallel between that experience and the very serious difficulties you are now experiencing in both of the parishes that I have entrusted to your pastoral care.” The bishop asked Poole to schedule a new meeting with him. Poole said he didn’t do it based on advice from an independent church lawyer from out of state. Under investigation Poole said his therapist asked for permission to report the old sex abuse claims to the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services last year. That report spurred a complaint filed in New Baden last month. “The whole matter remains under investigation, so I am not going into detail,” said Scott Meinhardt, the police chief. “We are trying to investigate something that occurred 35 years ago. There are a lot of different factors at play.” Also late last year, Poole contacted the Boy Scouts. He told them that he was troubled to see that Kreher was still listed as the chaplain for the Diocesan Catholic Committee on Scouting. The Boy Scouts took swift action. “When we did learn of the allegations in 2016, we took action to preclude him from any further participation in the scouting program,” said Christine Rasure, spokeswoman for the Greater St. Louis Area Council of Boy Scouts. Asked by telephone about the chaplain position, Kreher said he’d been working with only adult scout leaders. He said he resigned from his Scout commitments in recent months. “I felt like I wasn’t serving them well to begin with,” the priest said. “For a long time, I felt that. It was a good time because I since have spent several days in the hospital.” While in the hospital, he said, representatives of Children and Family Services visited him about the “nonsense” from the old claims by Poole. But Poole said he remained tormented from their relationship decades ago. He is steadfast in demanding that his diocese — and his bishop — set the record straight: “I am trying to move on in my life from being a victim to a survivor.” Tags Steven F.

But Calgary police homicide Det. Mike Shute, who helped arrange the raid by the RCMP's emergency response team, said no one was found, dead, or alive, during the July 4, 2014, search. Shute said the warrantless search was conducted because police believed they might have found Alvin and Kathy Liknes, and their grandson Nathan O'Brien, inside. Garland, 56, is charged with first-degree murder in connection with the June 30, 2014, disappearance of the couple from their Parkhill home along with the five-year-old boy. Their bodies have never been found. Shute told Crown prosecutor Shane Parker the search was considered a potential rescue mission and occurred after he placed Garland under investigative detention for kidnapping after he was grabbed in a traffic stop near his property. It followed a tip initiated by Garland's sister, Patti, that her brother drove a green Ford F-150 pickup similar to one caught on video surveillance near the scene of the Liknes' home. Patti Garland earlier testified she sent photos of the truck to her then-common law husband, Allen Liknes, the son of the missing grandfather. After Shute met with Patti Garland at an Airdrie park he went to the local RCMP detachment to arrange for the emergency response team to raid the rural farm. Before the search was conducted, Mounties stopped Garland in his pickup truck near the property before Shute dealt with the then-kidnapping suspect. "His demeanour was fine ... and he was cooperative at the time," said Shute of the accused. After the unsuccessful search for victims Shute took continuity of the 16-hectare farm after a debrief from an RCMP corporal. The Calgary officer was told "there was a burn barrel still smouldering on the property," and a bag was found containing a billy bat and handcuffs. It's the Crown's theory Garland kidnapped the three victims, took them to his farm and murdered them there. In her opening address, co-prosecutor Vicki Faulkner said Garland's motive for the crime was a years' old grudge he had against Alvin Liknes for not giving him credit for a pump the deceased had patented in the early 2000s. Meanwhile, court also heard from a footwear expert who examined partial bloodied footprints found inside the Liknes home. Sgt. Lynn Gallen said she compared the prints to a pair of size 13 Delta 2 Dr. Scholl's runners purchased by police at a Walmart store. The shoes were bought after police found an empty shoe box inside the Garland home for that product. Gallen found at least nine, and possibly 10, partial prints in the residence, primarily near a set of bloodstained dumbbells in the garage. She showed the three-woman, 11-man jury a series of powerpoint slides showing the footprints matched the treading on the bottom of the shoes. But under cross-examination by defence lawyer Kim Ross, Gallen agreed no such shoes were found at the Garland residence. Gallen also said they eliminated all shoes found at the accused's home as being the ones that made the bloody prints. Week two of the five-week trial begins Monday. KMartin@postmedia.com On Twitter: @KMartinCourts  As Advertised in the Calgary SUN Police were hoping to rescue Likneses and Nathan O'Brien at Garland family farm, court hears By Kevin Martin, Postmedia Network First posted: Friday, January 20, 2017 05:34 PM MST | Updated: Friday, January 20, 2017 09:59 PM MST Police conducted a frantic search of Douglas Garland's family farm in hopes of rescuing a Calgary couple and their grandson who had disappeared days earlier, court heard Friday. But Calgary police homicide Det. Mike Shute, who helped arrange the raid by the RCMP's emergency response team, said no one was found, dead, or alive, during the July 4, 2014, search. Shute said the warrantless search was conducted because police believed they might have found Alvin and Kathy Liknes, and their grandson Nathan O'Brien, inside. Garland, 56, is charged with first-degree murder in connection with the June 30, 2014, disappearance of the couple from their Parkhill home along with the five-year-old boy. Their bodies have never been found.

Skip to content Home News Sports Metro Plus Politics Business Entertainment Opinion Editorial Columnists Jobs Sections Search for: Entertainment Unnecessary politics in boardrooms puts me off –Olatorera Oniru Published January 21, 2017January 21, 2017 Share Tweet Pin it +1 Olatorera Oniru is the founder and CEO of Dressmeoutlet.com. In this interview with JESUSEGUN ALAGBE, she talks about her outlook on life, career, family and others In April 2016, Forbes described you as ‘the Nigerian woman who is building the fashion Amazon of Africa.’ How did you get that kind of recognition just two months after you launched Dressmeoutlet.com? I would assume a mix of factors was responsible. The market has a ton of opportunities that would interest a wide global audience and as a representative from Google once said to us, there is strong interest/demand for African products, yet there is low supply. The world is largely anticipating the boom of made in Africa products. The team at Forbes might have been impressed with the user interface, user experience or other factors they were able to decipher from Dressmeoutlet.com. To have also been nominated as a Most Promising Entrepreneur in Africa, surely they delved into my background, work experiences, awards and leadership potentials. You once worked at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Ericsson, the Central Bank of Nigeria and General Electric. Why did you quit regular jobs to launch Dressmeoutlet.com? I had a career growth plan from my entrepreneurship days and moving from paid employment to entrepreneurship was part of that plan. I worked in paid employment for over a decade across industries and across continents. My career plan was to accumulate solid education plus solid work experiences and then launch a series of notable businesses across Africa. Dressmeoutlet.com is the starting point for my post-employment business development goals. On the day you quit your last job to start your own company, what thoughts ran through your mind? I was relatively happy and this was probably because I was confident that the work experiences I had garnered were strong enough to propel me as an entrepreneur and I had saved up precisely well for the startup phase of the business. On the other hand, I knew I would miss the perks and comfort of the employed world — from frequent travels, to fixed salaries, to health care, pensions and more. All those perks could not hold me back much, if at all, because I was ready to create them and much more for myself and thousands of employees. This is why I continue to work tirelessly to grow the company and other businesses we are associated with. Within one year, Dressmeoutlet.com has grown to employ over 30 employees and we are not ready to slow down anytime soon. We want to continue sourcing and retailing the very best made in Africa fashion, beauty and home products to the world. How did working on Wall Street affect your outlook on life? Working on Wall Street was amazing — you get to feel and enjoy the real hustle and bustle of life. You also get to learn a whole lot. I took several free classes at the Merrill Lynch University and I networked with a lot of gurus in the industry. Sum up your experience in 2016 in three words. Start-up. Growth. Results. Were there times men intimidated you because of your success in the marketplace, especially as a woman, and tell us how you handled the intimidations? No intimidations here. We all have goals and missions in life. Everyone should be pushing their dreams and no one should be intimidated by another’s success or attempt to intimidate another based on their success. We must all push our dreams and support each other. Africa more than ever before needs much less competition and much more collaborations. Work together, push dreams and be great, individually and collectively. As many more citizens become great and greater, the entire nation will continue to grow into greatness. What’s the first thought that comes to your mind when you wake up? Appreciation for my beautiful family. My family means the world to me and I’m always glad and grateful to have them as we push our dreams together, smile together, laugh together and work hard together. Who is your favourite foreign artiste? I’m not sure I have a favourite, but over the years, I’ve enjoyed the music of Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston. Who is your favourite Nigerian artiste? I do not have a favourite, but I’ve liked certain songs produced by Mavin Records. Recently, I haven’t had as much time as I’d love to get to know the artistes behind the songs. As an entrepreneur and during your working years, you must have travelled to so many countries. Which is your favourite country so far? Nigeria remains my favourite and then the United States of America and then Turkey. All three are amazing countries, with Nigeria topping the list, as everything that makes me happy stems from within Nigeria — from my family, to investments, to friends, to career plans, and to growth potentials. The other two are second and third homes to me as I always have a great time when I go there and I lived in both for extended periods of time. If you could meet a legend, dead or alive, who would it be? If I could meet a legend, I’d say Sam Walton, the late founder of Walmart USA. Then maybe Jesus, regarded by Christians as the saviour of the world. Additionally, Coco Chanel, Mother Theresa and Oprah Winfrey. Who are the people who influence you in the business world? My father and my husband. What is your favourite business movie of all time? Honestly, I very rarely watch movies and if I do or ever have, I won’t remember the title. I only remember ‘Sound of Music’ and that’s about it. What is the greatest piece of advice you’ve ever heard? “Yes, we can” by Barack Obama. What keeps you awake at night while you should be sleeping? Work. I enjoy working, especially when I derive and exceed expected results. When my family goes to bed, I pull out my laptop and complete pending tasks and then create new tasks. It’s a non-stop cycle that I enjoy. What makes you angry? Anything unethical, wicked and unfair. I do not support wicked, unethical and unfair greed, also known as corruption — when certain men who forced themselves politically into leadership positions fail to create opportunities and developments yet harbour stolen wealth for themselves and the citizens who labour hard suffer in silence. If you were to give young women some pieces of advice to succeed in the marketplace, what would they be? Please, push your dreams. Don’t let anything stop you from doing anything great for the world. Be your very best in all your undertakings, love yourself and be the change you want to see in other leaders. Tell us how you met your husband? I met him during a business meeting we scheduled half a decade ago. We were discussing some business development plans and ended up loving each other’s company so much that we became a couple and then a family. What is your business philosophy? Work hard and innovate more. Do things because the impact is great — you are either able to change lives or make the world a better place. Money or personal wealth should not be the driving factors of greatness or success. What are your passions apart from business? Family, friends, dancing and having a great time. I love to have fun. I also still like travelling a bit. But lately, work doesn’t let me stay out of the country for more than 48 hours thereabout. What are the things that put you off in the boardroom? Lack of preparedness and unnecessary politics. Or being overly judgemental for personal reasons. Everyone should have equal rights to voice their opinions and contribute to discussions and developments. What qualities are essential for business success? Strength, vigour, versatility, love and care. What book are you reading now? Not reading one at the moment, but writing one. Looking back, tell us one singular decision you took that made you who you are today. Working on Wall Street was one of the best career decisions I made. I had other lucrative job offers after graduation and I’m very glad I went with the Wall Street offer. I learnt an ample lot, developed my financial acumen and grew significantly during my hustle and bustle years on Wall Street. I also made amazing friends that are still a significant part of my life today. As a leader, what does leadership mean to you? Leadership means having the means, resources and capabilities to do whatever it takes to make other people happy. Leaders are the driving forces of what they are leading. You are either driving a community, business, nation or family. Whatever you are driving, leaders must be great at what they do, they must have the knowledge and experience to succeed and they must have the love and passion for excellence and for making other people happy. Which business leader — Nigerian or foreign — has impacted your life most? I really enjoyed Barack Obama’s pre-presidency campaign and I also enjoyed his eight-year reign as president of one of the world’s greatest countries. His common quote “Yes we can” resonated very well with me throughout my university days and beyond. Copyright PUNCH.                All rights reserved.

Abiola I hate marriage by proxy , rubbish. D coming together of a man and a woman to sign d marriage agreement on d marriage day is one fit Africans have achieved. Cos it was done without the consent of d bride and groom b4. So if we are performing marriage in absentia nw , does it mean we are gradually reversing back to that old era ? Ahmed Marriage in absentia is not a taboo nor a terrible idea in Islam. As opined by Imam Abdulrahman “For this to be done, there has to be an assurance that both of them are really consenting to the union. The officiating minister must have spoken to both of them. He must have established on solid authority that the two parties are down with the arrangement. “It must be established that nobody is being coerced; nobody is being forced or tricked into such union. If there are practical difficulties of either of them being physically present, that would be the exceptional case I alluded to earlier on. It is not a taboo.” This is actually a personal experience where both parties and their parents knew each other and speak on a regular basis. The wife couldn’t take time off at work and I believe you’ll understand how the UK working system operates. The union is blessed with a child and both parties are living together in the UK. Sola I have a friend whose proxy wife has not been able to travel to join him going to 5 yrs now. The poor lady who is closed to menopause now is still waiting. Prince Adu/Tokyo IT’S IGBO STYLE. My Landlady before i left Nigeria had waited for her Husband in Germany for 15 years even when she knew the Man has married a German Woman with Kids as people were coming to tell her that the Husband has married,she was still waiting… This style is very common in IGBO LAND,all the names mentioned here are Igbos,…My Landlady Lives in ABA while she was also sleeping with Men too…..Is that Marriage too? Hans wow, Prince the african tribal warrior, did you read the story? Jurisconsult The first marriage ceremony in the Bible, that of Isaac and Rebecca was by proxy. Isaac was not there. Nothing wrong with it if there is good faith in the parties concerned. AduragbaPrayerpoint The story of how Isaac and Rebecca married was by divine arrangement. you may wish to know it was borne out of the fact Abraham and God had a convenantal relationship and so it was. Marriage by proxy today has to do with either material gain or out of desperation. In the late 90s,public servants were relocated to Abuja and many marriages were ruined irrepairably. The wise ones relocated with their spouses including some Christian couples while those who could afford flight always see their spouses every weekend until they sorted themselves out.Marriage by proxy should only be entertained in rare cases especially if the would- be couple have fulfilled all requirements and with the consent of the parents and the period of absentia not more than three months so that the devil with not capitalize on the vulnerability of either of them. The devil comes to steal, kill and destroy.Be wise! Toke This type of wedding is not that bad. It depends on who is living abroad between the couples. My uncle did it and is successful. He and his wife are living happily with there lovely kids in Canada. farooq such marriages are already under duress before they even start out………………… Kelvin This type of marriage can never stand the test of time Family Spice Special Features Education Vox Pop Sex & Relationship Letters Privacy Policy Terms of Use About punchng.com © 1971-2017 The Punch newspaper

The commission’s discussion of Shelter Ridge application will continue at its Feb. 14 meeting in the city hall auditorium. Mayor Mark Lauretti said this most recent extension granted by developers is to assure that whatever plan is approved for the 121-acre piece of land is the best option for the city. “What’s the hurry? This is a big project,” said Lauretti. Conservation Commission Chairman Tom Harbinson didn’t speak at the meeting but said the extension could have both positive and negative effects after the Shelter Ridge portion was completed. “Time is good for contemplation, but time is also the enemy of economic development. Because time is money. That’s the balance we’re trying to achieve here. We want to be responsive to a developer that wants to invest in our community but you also want to be thoughtful to the people who live here.” Residents in attendance groaned and some left when Parkins announced there wouldn’t be a vote made at the meeting. The opposition Prior to the Thursday night special meeting, a dozen or so protesters gathered outside of city hall with picket signs in hand to try to persuade the commission to deny the project. One of the leaders to the opposition known as Save Our Shelton (S.O.S.), Gregory Tetro said he was disgusted to learn that there are already several other residential developments being proposed within the city. “This is a tipping point for the community… There’s already other ‘Shelter Ridges’ being proposed,” said Tetro. “Applicants propose one set of residential units and before we can even see them built, there are already several others appearing before the P&Z. It’s all happening too fast. Shelton is for sale.” Tetro said he still believes that there are still “efficient alternatives” that the city could use the land for, rather than build the mixed-use development. “I expect for this space to be developed,” said Tetro. “The city could buy a portion of the land. There’s a strong chance that if they bought the whole thing they could put city hall there, they could put the new Echo Hose fire department there, they can move stuff in there to be useful, dignified, while also protecting the Paugussett Trail.” The disruption of the Paugussett Trail was one of the most common issues expressed by the opposition, as it represents 25 years of work towards making it connect to Stratford’s town line.   Peter Squitieri of Shelton also spoke at the protest and said the 300,000 square feet of high end retail, which would be included in the Shelter Ridge plan if it were to be approved as presented, is not a good fit for the city, nor practical for 2017. “Ecommerce is taking over,” said Squitieri. “We don’t need high end retail. Everyone is shopping online. Amazon has surpassed Wal-Mart as the number one retailer. Macy’s stores are closing across the country.” Another commonly expressed issue that was also a big reason the commission asked for an extension, is traffic. Both, Commissioners Jimmy Tickey and Virginia Harger said they would like to see the width of Bridgeport Avenue widened to adjust to any increase in traffic. Residents could be heard whispering, “It’s a simple thumbs down or thumbs up,” while the commission listened to Planning and Zoning Consultant Anthony Panico review a condensed version of the information on the development. Panico expressed that he also has concerns of the effects the development would have on traffic because he’s already seen an increase with the construction of Big Y. Although there was no vote casted by the commission, Commissioner Tickey and Anthony Pagoda were the only two that voiced issue with the proposed zone change to a PDD. The commission did agree that they would like to see the scale of residential units decreased to around 375 units from the previously adjusted 411.   Meeting dynamics Panico was not physically present for the meeting, but participated in the discussion about the application for the 121-acre development via telephone from Florida. Multiple residents said they were displeased that Panico wasn’t present for the meeting, but Chairman Parkins said the means of communication is accepted for P&Z meetings. Parkins added that the policy which enables members of the board or the consultant to participate in a discussion via telephone is a policy that the commission doesn’t plan to change. The chairman defended the policy despite having to ask Panico multiple times during the commission’s discussion to speak up because it was difficult to hear him over the phone “We’ve had him call into meetings for many many years now,” said Parkins. “…As a taxpayer you’re certainly welcome to come to city hall and get a copy of the tapes because it is all tape recorded.Telephonic participation is allowed by state statute.” Chairman addresses opposition Parkins said despite the opposition’s surprisingly large turnout throughout the duration of the hearings, the “silent masses that won’t speak” are a larger support in favor of the development. “There’s 36,000 people that live in this city. So I think there’s a silent majority out there that’s been just a little too silent on their preference,” Parkins said. “So if they don’t really care one way or the other, they don’t mind seeing it once it happens, they just have not come and been outspoken. I can certainly appreciate why.” Tetro disagreed. “I’ve been to every diner that’s in this town, I’ve been to bars, I’ve been to pizzerias and I still haven’t found those people,” said Tetro. “If there out there, they’re huddled in a cave some where because they’re not out there. Everyone I’ve spoken to has said they don’t like it, they don’t want it, but they fear retribution from the mayor because they are business owners.” Growth v.s. swelling Commissioner Tickey said the proposed site plan and information presented portrayed a very “rosy” picture for the commission. “There’s growth and then there’s swelling. I think something like this is so enormous it takes our eyes off the ball and potential development that we could have elsewhere in the city, such as downtown. I think this wildly goes beyond what I would consider appropriate for commercial development on Bridgeport Ave… I do agree with economic development and I have a record of supporting that here, but this goes so beyond balanced development. In the city’s charter it reads that P&Z commissioners are responsible for making sure all developments are in the best interest of residents. “For me, this doesn’t meet the standard that’s put on us,” said Tickey.

Required fields are marked * Name * Email * Website  −  five  =  two Comment Some HTML is OK Sign me up for the Money Morning newsletter New projections estimate that legal marijuana sales could hit $6.7 billion in 2016, which is why we've made a list of five marijuana stocks to watch in 2017. The marijuana industry is poised to soar now that California, Massachusetts, Maine, and Nevada just legalized recreational marijuana. And because Money Morning Director of Tech & Venture Capital Research Michael A. Robinson sees California as a leader in cutting-edge issues, other states will quickly follow suit. "Fact is, California stands as one of the world's largest economies, so just the sheer volume of sales in the state would be massive. As we have seen with things like environmental legislation and gay rights, the state is on the cutting edge of major issues that have socioeconomic impacts. Other states will look at California's success in rolling this out as their model for legislation," Robinson told me on Nov. 8. You see, investing in the marijuana industry is being called the gold rush of the 21st century. And we don't want Money Morning readers to miss out. Along with our five 2017 marijuana stocks to watch, we'll also show you how you can get our 90-page investment guide for the booming marijuana industry. Here's the first on our list of marijuana stocks to watch in 2017… Marijuana Stocks to Watch in 2017 No. 5: mCig Inc MCig Inc. (OTCMKTS: MCIG) is a penny stock, and penny stocks can be risky. But even with the risks, MCIG is a marijuana stock to watch in 2017. MCig is based in Nevada, and it offers equipment for marijuana home growers, vaporizers, greenhouses, and cultivation rooms. Rollies LLC, owned by mCig, sells smoking tubes that could increase in popularity with more states approving recreational marijuana policies. BRILLIANT: Average Americans Are Becoming Marijuana Millionaires And as marijuana is legalized in more states, the demand for mCig's products will increase. For their fiscal 2016, mCig reported $1.7 billion in revenue and gross profit of $290,774. Over the last 12 months, MCIG has climbed 282.76%. Marijuana Stocks to Watch in 2017 No. 4: GW Pharmaceuticals Plc. GW Pharmaceuticals Plc. (Nasdaq ADR: GWPH) uses plant-derived cannabinoid therapeutics to help patients suffering from various diseases and medical conditions. GW's Sativex is the first prescription medicine derived from a cannabis plant, and it's used to treat spasticity. GW is also working on a product called Epidiolex, which could be used by patients with rare epilepsy disorders. Because marijuana is listed as a Schedule I drug, it can't be used for medical purposes. But legalization and marijuana reform could help it get reclassified, which would allow GW to offer more plant-derived cannabinoid therapeutics. GWPH has skyrocketed over 50% in the last 12 months. In comparison, the S&P 500 has climbed just 6.42%. Marijuana Stocks to Watch in 2017 No. 3: General Cannabis Corp. Source: FactSet General Cannabis Corp. (OTCMKTS: CANN) provides services to the regulated cannabis industry. General Cannabis provides a large list of services, including: Acquisitions and leasing of cultivation space Security services including video surveillance and cash transportation services Designing, distribution, and selling of apparel Consulting services General Cannabis was founded in 2013. It's headquartered in Colorado, the first state to legalize recreational marijuana. According to the Denver Post, legal marijuana sales in Colorado alone are expected to reach $1 billion for 2016. Over the last 12 months, the CANN stock price has climbed 315%. Aside from MCIG, GWPH, and CANN, there are two other companies involved in the marijuana industry that are worth watching in 2017. Marijuana isn't the core of their businesses, but these companies are creating partnerships and filling a growing demand through their already successful products and services. These are the two other companies in the marijuana industry Robinson is keeping an eye on… Marijuana Stocks to Watch in 2017 No. 2: Microsoft Corp. It's true most investors wouldn't view Microsoft Corp. (Nasdaq: MSFT) as a marijuana stock. But this past June, Microsoft used its powerful software and cloud services to become the go-to source for the cannabis industry. KIND Financial, a company that uses technology to make sure transactions in the marijuana industry are safe, secure, and compliant, partnered with Microsoft in June to run software through Microsoft's cloud. As more states legalize marijuana, there will be a bigger need to track sales and to make sure local businesses are compliant with rules and regulations. The MSFT stock price is already up 9.3% in the last 12 months, with its cloud-based services revenue climbing 116% year over year in its latest quarter. Trending Story: States Legalizing Marijuana in 2017 Its software services in the booming marijuana industry will help that number continue to climb. And our final marijuana stock to watch in 2017 may be just as surprising as Microsoft… Marijuana Stocks to Watch in 2017 No. 1: Scotts Mircale-Gro Co. The other company Robinson is watching is Scotts Miracle-Gro Co. (NYSE: SMG). You can find Scotts' lawn care and gardening products in some of the leading retail stores in the country, like Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE: WMT) and Home Depot Inc. (NYSE: HD). Between 2001 and 2009, revenue climbed 80% for Scotts because retailers like Walmart and Home Depot were expanding. But since the financial collapse of 2008-2009, sales have been stagnant, according to Forbes. In order to increase revenue growth, CEO Jim Hagedorn is now investing millions in the marijuana industry. Hagedorn purchased two companies that sell fertilizers, soil, and accessories for marijuana growers back in 2015. He also invested $120 million (a 75% stake) in the hydroponics equipment company Gavita International in July 2016. But there are even more companies for investors to target a seven-figure weed windfall with the top pot stocks from every ecosystem – growers, edibles, dispensaries, and more… As a service to Money Morning readers, we're now making available a 90-page cannabis investing guide called "The Roadmap to Marijuana Millions." This "bible of weed investing" reveals the world's top marijuana stocks every serious investor should consider right now. Normally valued at $499, it can be yours absolutely free.

I have bells going off on a little sign stating a merger or Buyout is on the rise. CGC to buy or merge OGI. Ill bet buyout. I say this because its imminent. There profitability is endless and going international. If a new Etf is introduced in the Pot sector which it will have to be as the seed is planted and vines are attaching themselves for future growth. I dont need all the details. I just know now that Bedrocan is in bed with Goldman and Sachs. OGI is a threat and a profitable one to boot. Only valued at an 1/8 of CGC but both companies were or still are managed by the same advisors in which tells me Goldman and Sachs arent far from OGI's front door with a butt load of money. I know I would do it. Canada has not legalized it as of yet but are young Premier smokes himself and loves his new attention. So! The choice will be easy for him. Mid 2017. My outlook on Canaopy growth is the the driving force of the industry and i forsee the mentality and outlook of a Sunedison mentality but with a much more intelligent board on hand to manage the rising demand of this substance. My only worry comes from years from now as we see how they control there overwhelming success. Greed is a dangerous and blinding mentality but those actions are to be followed after they reach 20 billion in the next 3 years. Enjoy your day!

(Photo source: Harrison County Sheriff's Department) (Photo source: Harrison County Sheriff's Department) (Photo source: Harrison County Sheriff's Department) (Photo source: Harrison County Sheriff's Department) SAUCIER, MS (WLOX) - Investigators with the Harrison County Sheriff’s Department have released photos of suspects believed to be involved with credit card skimming devices found at a Saucier gas station. Sheriff Troy Peterson said an anonymous tip led deputies to the discovery at the Robinwood One Stop on Hwy. 49 at the intersection of West Wortham Rd. Wednesday. Investigators recovered four skimming devices from four different pumps. Peterson said it is unclear how long the devices had been in place, but he described them as sophisticated. He said consumers would not be able to detect the devices. Investigators now say two men and two women were caught on camera at the gas station three consecutive days before the devices were found. Officials said they were traveling in a silver 2017 Ford Expedition. The same men and women allegedly used multiple fake credit cards with stolen numbers at Walmart and Walgreens stores in Gulfport. Credit card skimming devices are used to capture credit card information, including personal identification numbers, from consumers. Peterson said the investigation is ongoing. He said any suspicious activity should be reported to the sheriff’s department. The sheriff is urging residents to monitor their bank accounts for any suspicious activity. Copyright 2017 WLOX.

Here’s how stocks have reacted in the wake of Trump’s negative tweets. By Abby Schultz Jan. 20, 2017 3:36 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large President Donald Trump delivering his inaugural address in Washington, D.C. Photo: Getty Images It’s inauguration day and time for investors to get real about the new president. Donald Trump taking office as the United States’ 45th president means looking out for actual policy proposals. And yet investors can’t quite ignore those early morning tweets from the new president. While most U.S. presidents steer clear of influencing specific stocks, Trump has unpredictably called out individual companies like Boeing, Ford, GM and Apple for practices he dislikes — have spiked interest in these stocks and their peers despite an overall boost to the market fueled by a belief that a Republican president backed by a Republican Congress will loosen regulations on a range of industries, particularly banks and energy companies. While active stock traders may benefit from jumping on Trump’s every tweet, the vast majority of investors are best off stepping back and looking at broader themes. Overall, strategists who pay close attention to markets seem to expect Trump and the Republicans will spur jobs and growth, but that overall, the market may have gotten a little ahead of itself. Meanwhile, for certain sectors, like energy or health care, the future under Trump remains murky. “Now is the time to see what’s going to be transformed from campaign fodder to policy,” says Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott. “We’re taking the view that now is the time to be optimistic, but at the same time somewhat cautious.” And whether Trump keeps on delivering solo messages via tweets is anybody’s guess. “No one expected him to tweet the way he has and to call out specific companies,” says Mike Loewengart, vice president of investment strategy at E-Trade. A recent E-Trade survey found 60% of millennial investors who are active traders and have at least $10,000 in an online brokerage account have traded off a Trump tweet. In most cases, it turns out, the stocks of companies facing Trump’s wrath haven’t dramatically moved from tweet to inauguration day, and in some cases, they’ve even risen slightly. Here’s a look at the “Trump effect” on individual stocks, showing the stock’s price before Trump’s tweet, at the time of the Tweet, and at yesterday’s close.

He'd like to see crosswalks at the intersections. (Photo source: WLOX) GULFPORT, MS (WLOX) - The strip of Highway 49 in Gulfport where a pedestrian was killed Thursday night is lined with restaurants, shops, and hotels. The six-lane highway is not only filled with cars, it’s also filled with pedestrians. Mark Limon crosses the roadway nearly 20 times a week, looking for work and catching the bus to save some time. However, he knows he’s taking a chance. “They don’t have any walkways to cross this highway here. It’s a brand new highway as you can see and there’s no way to get across it. You have to actually jaywalk," Limon said. "Even if I got to the light down there, there’s still no crosswalk there. So you definitely have to cross at your own risk.” Limon also crosses the busy highway at night. “Definitely....I make sure there’s cars at a distance," added Limon.  Jason Mauffray, who walks a lot in the area, was in Walmart when the accident happened. “I have to worry about the drivers, yes,” Mauffray said. “It’s kind of awkward having to walk across here and ain’t got no stop lights and no where you can just press a button and walk across.” There are some areas of Highway 49 where the accident happened that the median is wide enough for people to be able to stop and wait for traffic coming the other way. Other places, there’s no median at all. But no matter what safety procedures are put in place, people are going to cross this highway every day. Stephanie Waddell crosses at least twice a day, but that doesn’t mean she feels safe. “Sometimes it looks like people are not going to slow down,” Waddell said. “It even looks like they speed up sometimes.” A friend of Waddell's was hit about a month ago. She says he’s fine, but that something needs to be done. “I think people need to pay more attention. I mean, if they see somebody trying to cross, they need to slow down.” The Biloxi Police Department is investigating the accident.  Copyright 2017 WLOX.

That’s what H&R Block, the nation’s largest tax-preparation chain, is advertising on giant banners outside its storefronts and in TV commercials featuring Jon Hamm of “Mad Men”: “You could get a refund advance of up to $1,250.” It is the first time in six years that the company has offered to front customers some money from their anticipated refund. Two of H&R Block’s biggest rivals, Jackson Hewitt and Liberty Tax Service, are hyping nearly identical offers — dangling up to $1,300 cash. The nation’s big tax-preparation companies are so desperate for customers that they are willing to put money up front — with absolutely no hidden fees or interest charges, and no ironclad guarantees that the companies will be paid back. H&R Block, for one, has arranged a $1.65 billion funding line for its refund advances, giving pause to some of the Wall Street analysts who follow the company. Two dynamics are harming H&R Block and its competitors. One is the widespread availability of cheap (and even free) online tax-filing alternatives. The other is a series of regulatory moves that clamped down on refund anticipation loans, which the companies formerly relied on to lure in people who needed cash. The loans typically came with high interest rates and fees, which customers paid on top of the money charged for tax preparation. By 2012, such loans had become nearly extinct after a regulatory crackdown that forced most major banks out of the market. Consumer advocates, who had seen the loans as predatory, were thrilled. The same advocates are looking warily at the resurrection of this type of loan. The new generation of refund advances are really, truly, no-hidden-fine-print free, though the tax preparers may use them to cross-sell other services. Customers who qualify will be advanced a portion of their tax refund within a day or so, with no fees or interest, though they will still need to pay for the provider’s tax preparation services, which can cost hundreds of dollars. Struggling tax companies acknowledge that they are using the loans as a come-on to make up for the loss of walk-in traffic and people who have migrated to TurboTax and its alternatives. Each loan will cost H&R Block an average of $32 to $36, according to regulatory filings — which the company will chalk up as a customer-acquisition expense. “The early part of the tax season is really driven by consumers who need their refund to live,” said David Prokupek, chief executive of Jackson Hewitt. “Our goal is to help them get fast access to their money, at no cost. This has some risk for us, but we needed to do something in the stores that you can’t get online.” The loan offers are open to all customers, but they are particularly aimed at low-income Americans who live paycheck to paycheck and rely on their tax refund as their biggest annual cash infusion. For many people, it is a critical way to pay off holiday debt, catch up on overdue bills or cover emergency expenses like car repairs. Those taxpayers typically file their returns as early as possible. This year, tax-filing season starts Monday and runs through April 18. But millions of people will not be able to collect their refunds until late February because of a new federal rule that delays refunds for filers claiming certain credits. “We think that’s going to cause real pain,” said Brad Hanson, president of MetaBank, the lender that is funding H&R Block’s and Jackson Hewitt’s loans. “We’re looking to bridge that gap, in a responsible way.” Refund loans used to carry a notoriously high price tag. In 2002, at the product’s peak, nearly 13 million customers paid more than $1 billion in fees for refund loans, according to data compiled by the National Consumer Law Center. Pressed by consumer advocates, regulators clamped down. In late 2010, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ordered H&R Block’s lender, HSBC, to quit making refund loans. Soon after, the loans effectively died. For tax preparation companies, the hit was devastating. On top of the lost income from those lucrative fees, they found that without the offer of refund advances, many customers stopped coming in at all. But a few years ago, Jackson Hewitt figured out how to offer refund loans in a way that would pass regulatory muster: It paid all the fees itself. “The industry has fundamentally changed,” said Prokupek, who joined Jackson Hewitt in 2014, three years after the company took a trip through bankruptcy court. “The way I put it was: The girl’s not coming back.” A tax refund is a commodity, he concluded, and to stand out from the crowd, Jackson Hewitt, which has 3,000 of its 6,000 stores within Walmart stores, would need to offer things the competition did not — like refund advances. To make it work, he came up with a wholly new approach: Treat the loans as a marketing expense. Jackson Hewitt began offering these advances three years ago and was successful enough that a major rival, Liberty Tax, copied its model the next year. H&R Block announced its program in October. Analysts estimate that around 1 million customers took out refund loans last year. This year, H&R Block alone may double that volume. “We are looking to do a lot of loans to a lot of people, and we will be marketing this aggressively,” Bill Cobb, H&R Block’s chief executive, told analysts on a call. The company has promised not to pass the cost on in any way to customers taking advances. Some investors are not thrilled about that math: A Morgan Stanley analyst recently downgraded H&R Block, writing skeptically in a research note that the loans “may be a drag to margins.” Of course, tax companies have found other ways to skim off customers’ money with add-on products. Many low-income customers lack the cash to pay tax preparation fees up front. Instead, they essentially finance them with a “refund transfer.” For a fee — at H&R Block, it is $35 — the company will set up a temporary bank account to collect a customer’s refund, and wait until it arrives to deduct the fee. H&R Block collected $165 million last year from those transfers. The company also heavily promotes its Emerald Card, a reloadable prepaid debit card on which customers are encouraged to store their refunds. For some customers, H&R Block offers a credit line of up to $1,000 on those cards — for a $45 annual fee, at a 36 percent annual interest rate. Qualifying for a refund advance does not involve a credit check, and the advance will not show up on customers’ credit reports. If a customer’s refund is smaller than the amount that has been advanced, or is garnisheed by the IRS, the lender will be required to write the loan balance off as a loss. “In those cases, we do not attempt to collect, in any way,” said Greg Steinlicht, H&R Block’s vice president for financial services. H&R Block declined to comment on what percentage of applicants it expected to be approved. Jackson Hewitt said its approval rate was running around 80 percent. The company started prequalifying customers in November; so far, more than 450,000 people have been approved. Consumer advocates are keeping a wary watch on this new incarnation of refund loans. The new loans appear to be “very different from the bad, old refund loans of 10 years ago,” said Chi Chi Wu, a lawyer with the National Consumer Law Center. But customers will need to be on guard against tacked-on fees for extra products, and they may end up spending more than necessary to have their taxes done by a preparer offering refund loans. Tax preparation prices are frequently opaque, and wildly variable. A “mystery shopper” study done last year by Georgia Watch, a consumer advocacy group, found that the prices quoted to prepare a return for a low-income single mother at local stores, including independent shops and chains, ranged from $125 to $457. “Only one office even had prices disclosed publicly, and often, the fees seemed to be completely arbitrary,” said Liz Coyle, Georgia Watch’s executive director. “It’s almost impossible for someone to comparison shop.” And for those who need money fast, refund loans are powerful draws. “This is an effort to arrest our client loss, to bring more people to our office,” said Steinlicht of H&R Block. “The product went away for several years, but the client demand for it never did.” Stacy Cowley is a New York Times writer.

Even though the Indianapolis-based chain’s shares trade for a mere 69 cents apiece, the investment firm UBS has a “sell” recommendation on the stock, concluding in a recent report that “it will continue to be a challenge for [HHGregg] to reverse its fortunes.” The shares took a dramatic tumble on Jan. 9, after HHGregg reported disastrous preliminary sales figures for the quarter ended Dec. 31. Sales of stores open at least 14 months tumbled 22 percent, dragged down by a 39 percent plunge in consumer electronics and 4 percent decline in appliances. In the first day of trading following the after-market announcement, HHGregg shares shed 40 percent, closing at 78 cents on trading volume that was 20 times the norm. The stock has continued to tick down since. HHGregg’s model “simply isn’t built to sustain such large sales decays,” UBS retail analyst Michael Lasser said in a report. He said he didn’t foresee a turnaround until store traffic improves, adding that in an environment where HHGregg “has felt the need to become increasingly cautious on advertising expenses, we expect this will be tough to do.” In its Jan. 9 announcement, the company said it expected quarterly sales of $453 million, down from $593 million in the same quarter of last year and far short of the $564 million forecast by analysts. HHGregg “remains a challenged retailer in a challenged space,” Greg Melich, an analyst at Evercore ISI, wrote in a Jan. 12 report. “It’s hard to get excited about a company with falling traffic, falling share and falling gross profit dollars.” The company, founded in 1955 and now operating 220 stores in 19 states, went public at $13 a share in 2007. The stock later went on a tear, rising to $30 in 2010 before price deflation in consumer electronics and other challenges magnified by its rapid growth sent performance into a tailspin. Riesbeck The company now has failed to turn a profit in 12 consecutive quarters, leaving analysts to ponder whether it has a future in an increasingly competitive retail environment dominated by far-larger companies, from Amazon.com and Wal-Mart to Best Buy and Lowe’s. Both Evercore and UBS say, however, that HHGregg can improve market share if it can capitalize on Sears’ troubles. That company announced plans in early January to close 150 stores, about 10 percent of 1,500 locations. But with HHGregg’s same-store sales and stock price falling so precipitously, the retailer is a “warrant on survival,” Evercore’s Melich wrote. HHGregg CEO Robert Riesbeck declined to comment, citing the quiet period leading up to the scheduled release of full fiscal third-quarter results on Jan. 26. But in the Jan. 9 press release, he said HHGregg made the strategic decision to compete less in the consumer electronics category during the holiday season and will continue to focus on appliances and home products. The company also will continue transitioning from entry-level televisions in favor of more expensive premium models. Riesbeck has continued to strike an upbeat tone. After HHGregg on Jan. 3 announced the hiring of 32-year-old Aaron Trahan as chief merchandising officer—the fifth person to hold that position in as many years—Riesbeck described Trahan as a “rising star” in the industry. “Although this year has been trying from a comp sales and profitability standpoint, I’m confident that the changes to the team and our strong liquidity position have set us up for future success,” he said in an email to IBJ. The company had no debt as of Sept. 30 and was eligible to borrow up to$142 million under a line of credit. However, its financial cushion is shrinking. It had cash and cash equivalents of just$1.27 million as of Sept. 30, down from $34.8 million on Sept. 30, 2015. In an effort to boost appliance sales, HHGregg intends to open more locations of its super-premium Fine Lines chain. The company ended its latest fiscal year in March with 11 of the stores and plans to ramp up quickly. Riesbeck told IBJ in September that HHGregg hoped to open 20 to 25 Fine Lines locations over the next 18 months. HHGregg has found that, when it adds a Fine Lines to an existing store, it doubles appliance volume in that store, he said. The company has put the brakes on adding HHGregg locations, but so far has not announced mass closings. In August, HHGregg shuttered all five of its stores in Wisconsin and another in Vernon Hills, Illinois, north of Chicago.•   Email Tweet ADVERTISEMENT Reporter Real estate, retail, legal issues Property Lines Real estate blog moderator Olson became real estate reporter in March 2013 after spending four years as online reporter for IBJ Daily.

It looks like students who have been complaining about deceptive lending practice and outrageously high student loan debt were right all along. Lawsuits filed on Wednesday against the nation’s largest student loan lender Navient, and it’s lending predecessor Sallie Mae, included sweeping charges accusing the company of repeatedly cheating and misleading borrowers, bungling payments, and taking shortcuts to increase their bottom line. According to Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson, “Anyone who borrowed a private loan from Sallie Mae prior to 2010 or currently has their loan serviced by Navient could be impacted.” The lawsuits, filed by Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, seek financial relief for the millions adversely affected by the allegedly dishonest lending behavior. Both the state and federal lawsuits agree that the student loan company engaged in aggressive, widespread, subprime lending practices. According to Attorney General Madigan, while the student loan company made billions of dollars loaning money to hopeful students, many of the loans that were given out carried extremely high interest rates, hidden fees, and were often distributed to students attending poorly-accredited, for-profit schools. “One of the most egregious offenses we found is that Navient saddled students with expensive and risky subprime loans that they designed to fail. Navient entered into agreement with schools to pay the company for some of those defaults, so that Navient did not have to shoulder all of the losses. Meanwhile, borrowers were left with a lifetime of debt that they were unable to pay.” [Image by KLH49/iStock] Regarding the federal lawsuit, Richard Cordray, the director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, explained the case against the student loan lender. “At every stage of repayment, Navient chose to shortcut and deceive consumers to save on operating costs.” RT reported that the federal lawsuit also alleged that Navient pushed students into payment options that only served to increase Navient’s profits at the borrower’s expense. However, according to NBC, Navient officials denied any wrongdoing, somewhat nonsensically claiming that the allegations are merely politically motivated. The growing problem of student loan debt, which needless to say, negatively affects both Democratic and Republican voters, has traditionally been seen as an issue that mostly targets young people. Recently however, it’s also begun to worry a greater percentage of the older generation. According to Madigan, “A growing number of loans require cosigners so you’ve seen parents and grandparents that are now on the hook for some very difficult loans.” Unlike any other type of debt, student loans are not dischargeable in bankruptcy. In fact, the entire system appears to be set up to fail for the majority of the population. Insisting that students, and increasingly their families, go into massive amounts of debt in order to obtain the education that is needed to participate in today’s economy seems absurd, at best. It’s also worth mentioning that in many cases, thousands of dollars in student loans are issued to 18-year-olds with no credit history, who most likely wouldn’t even be approved for their own cell phone plan. Yet student loan companies are somehow allowed to prey on these financially-illiterate teenagers, locking them into a lifetime of indentured servitude, with high student loan payments that destroy their chances of becoming successful contributors to the economy before they even have an opportunity to try. [Image by Lucian3D/Shutterstock] Furthermore, even those without any student loan debt bear the economic consequences of this type of predatory lending behavior. In a society where the disposable income of the average young person is nearly nonexistent due to crippling student loan payments, the economy suffers, making successful small businesses, risk-taking, and innovation increasingly rare. Take, for example, the attempts of local, small businesses to compete with monoliths like Walmart by offering quality, made-in-America products. In these cases, a large part of the success for small business owners depends on having customers who aren’t just scraping by, and who can afford to purchase the well-made items or the innovative products that they wish to offer. However, as more people become saddled with student loan debt, these types of customers become ever rarer, creating a vicious cycle that suppresses healthy competition and local economies. This system viciously shutters small businesses while rewarding giant, multinational corporations, favoring those who can reach rock-bottom prices through the exploitation of overseas labor and natural resources, and ultimately furthers both monopolization and economic inequality. Understanding the connection between skyrocketing student loan debt and a failing economy is a key part of addressing the issue of inequality in the U.S. These lawsuits against America’s biggest education profiteers are an encouraging first step in leveling the playing field, and creating an economy that works for all of us, not just those at the top.

Debra Clayton's patrol car - Original Credit: Orlando Police - Original Source: Orlando Police (Orlando Police / Courtesy photo) Caitlin DoornbosContact ReporterStaff Writer Slain officer's patrol car vandalized in front of the Orlando Police Department. Privacy Policy The police car that the late Lt. Debra Clayton was driving before she was killed while trying to catch an accused killer Jan. 9 was vandalized Thursday, according to the Orlando Police Department. Clayton's patrol vehicle has been parked outside police headquarters at 100 S. Hughey Ave. since her death. Mourners have been paying their respects to the slain officer by laying flowers and wreaths around the vehicle while it has been on display. Police released photos Friday of the vehicle defaced with what appears to be permanent marker. Pictures show the front of the car marked with rambling scrawled messages such as "Tax Payer," "Protect & Serve The Public," "Angela Madison is the best," "Love you" "Rapest"[sic] and "Kansas." "Unbelievably sad someone would vandalize Lt. Debra Clayton's vehicle," Orlando Police posted on its Twitter account. Orlando Police will not move the vehicle, but rather it will remain parked in front of the station at Pine Street and Hughey Avenue next to banners of Clayton's face and makeshift memorials, according to OPD spokeswoman Wanda Miglio. A bouquet of flowers and wooden angel wings rested on the top of the defaced front end amid the unwanted scribblings. Police do not know who committed the offense but are investigating, Miglio said. "We are checking the cameras and looking for a suspect," Miglio said. Markeith Loyd was arrested Tuesday after a massive manhunt that began after Clayton was gunned down outside a Wal-Mart in northwest Orlando. He had been wanted since the killing of his ex-girlfriend, Sade Dixon, in December, and police said Loyd killed Clayton when she tried to confront him at the store. Police officially filed charges against him in Clayton's death Thursday, and he now faces a total of 10 charges related to the two incidents. Clayton, 42, was a 17-year veteran of the Police Department and was posthumously promoted from the rank of master sergeant. She is survived by her husband and son. No suspects in the vandalism had been announced as of Friday afternoon. cdoornbos@orlandosentinel.com or 407-650-6931 Copyright © 2017, Sun Sentinel Crime Vandalism Homicide Orlando Police Department Markeith Loyd Lt.

Ryder Image 1of/1 Caption Close Image 1 of 1 This artwork by M. Ryder refers to gun laws in the U.S. This artwork by M. Ryder refers to gun laws in the U.S. Photo: M. Ryder Jonathan Perloe op-ed: Protecting our borders on gun rights 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Thankful that her daughter was at the Ft. Lauderdale airport the day before the mass shooting last week, my cousin remarked, “Shows you that anything can happen anywhere or any time.” She’s right — a gun owner can legally fly to many states around the country with his firearm and ammunition in checked baggage, unpack it upon arrival and carry it loaded in non-secure areas of airports. How is that? Because unlike Connecticut, many states have reciprocity agreements that honor other states’ concealed carry weapon (CCW) permits, some with notoriously low standards. So lax, in fact, that states such as Florida, Texas and Indiana have allowed hundreds of convicted felons to carry concealed weapons, according to the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. With reciprocity, these gun owners can easily carry in other states, for short visits or extended stays. Connecticut, with the fifth-lowest rate of gun deaths in the nation, does not honor any other state’s CCW permit. We want to ensure that people carrying guns in public in Connecticut meet our tough public safety requirements. But right now, Congress, President-elect Donald Trump and the National Rifle Association are working to force Connecticut to honor the CCW permits of every other state, regardless of how permissive they are. On the first day of the newly seated Congress, Rep. Richard Hudson (R-N.C.) introduced his Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act of 2017, requiring states to honor all other states’ concealed carry permits. The measure goes farther than 2013 legislation that passed the House but was only narrowly defeated in the Senate, by a margin of just three votes. According to UCLA law professor Adam Winkler, Hudson’s bill extends reciprocity to states that do not even require permits, so-called “constitutional carry” states that allow any lawful gun owner to carry in public, without training or up-to-date background checks. Most concerning, the bill would enable Connecticut residents to circumvent our own requirements by applying for mail-order permits from states like Utah, which issues two-thirds of its permits to out-of-state residents. That would lead to a “race-to-the-bottom” for gun safety. Like gun rights advocates, Mr. Trump compares gun permits to drivers’ licenses, which should “work in every state.” The analogy is bogus. All 50 states require competency tests, registration and liability insurance to obtain a driver’s license. None of that is true for gun ownership. With no national database of gun registration (prohibited at the federal level, thanks to the gun lobby) or interstate information sharing as with the Driver License Compact, there would be no way for law enforcement to know if an out-of-state resident packing heat is carrying legally. Public safety would not be enhanced with gun-toting visitors who may have only passed Virginia’s online test with a “C” on their fourth attempt. Gun rights advocates justify “carry everywhere” with the argument that CCW holders enhance public safety. They peddle myths that armed citizens reduce crime and stop mass shootings. An FBI study of active shooter incidents found that only 3 percent were stopped by an armed civilian. More than four times as many were stopped by unarmed citizens. We depend on law enforcement for our public safety for a reason: stopping armed criminals takes a lot of training. Something Good Samaritan Joseph Wilcox didn’t have when he intervened in a 2014 active shooter situation in a Las Vegas Walmart, only to get shot dead in the back by an accomplice. The National Research Council convened a panel of academic experts to review studies that claim more guns yield less crime, including one by discredited academic and NRA front-man John Lott. All except one of the 16 members concluded there was “no credible evidence” that concealed carry laws reduce violent crime. Connecticut has no desire to “outsource” the laws that protect our residents from gun violence. Rep. Richard Hudson’s bill is a serious threat to states’ rights and public safety. It requires a strong response from concerned citizens to defeat. The bill already has 102 co-sponsors, all but two from the majority party that controls Congress. Reports the Independent Journal Review, a far-right news site, “This law has been NRA’s number one legislative agenda item for several years. And with the election of Donald Trump as president, as well as pro-gun majorities in both houses of the U.S. Congress, the prospects for such a law have never looked better.” Gun violence prevention groups across the country are mobilizing to defeat the bill; but grassroots support is essential. With Senators Richard Blumenthal and Chris Murphy, and Representatives Joe Courtney, Rose DeLauro, Elizabeth Esty, Jim Himes and John Larson, we can count on a strong offense from our Congressional delegation. Their position will be strengthened if concerned citizens show their support. They should contact their Congressional representatives and tell them they agree: the federal government has no business telling Connecticut who can carry a gun within its borders.

START THE CLOCK: Reps. Pat Tiberi (R-Ohio) and Bill Pascrell (D-N.J.) spoke with former Rep. Mike Ferguson, head of BakerHostetler’s federal policy team, at the law and lobbying firm’s panel on the first 100 days. “The wild card in all of this will be the new president,” Ferguson said. On Obamacare repeal and replace, Tiberi said, “We’re still trying to figure out, process-wise, how do we do this to get it to the finish line.” The Affordable Care Act wasn’t passed in one bill, so undoing it won’t be either, he said. On Vice President Mike Pence’s role: “He has already been reaching out and come talk to us several times and will continue that.” Tiberi said tax reform will get done, but not quickly, as everyone needs to get on the same page.

How Salt Lake City’s 1990’s radical urban planning experiment is paving the path for 2050: In the latest installment of POLITICO Magazine’s “What Works,” read how a liberal city in a conservative state created a bipartisan alliance of business, industrial, religious, political and civic leaders, who solicited ideas from tens of thousands of Utah citizens that yielded long-term benefits in controlling urban sprawl, traffic congestion and water conservation.

He was director of government affairs at Covidien from 2007 to 2015. Last week Trump blamed drug lobbyists for inflated prices. OTHER INAUGURALS: — Miles Rapoport, previously president of Common Cause, will be senior practice fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School’s Ash Center for Democratic Governance. LEGAL EAGLES, CONT’D: The blog Above the Law obtained an email announcing ELEVEN Jones Day lawyers joining incoming White House counsel Don McGahn in the administration: Bill McGinley: Deputy Assistant to the President, Director of Cabinet Affairs James Burnham: Senior Associate Counsel to the President Annie Donaldson: Special Counsel to the President, chief of staff to the White House Counsel Stephen Vaden: Special Assistant to Secretary of Agriculture Blake Delaplane: Special Assistant to the White House Counsel John Gore: Deputy Assistant AG for Civil Rights Michael Murray: Counsel to the Deputy Attorney General James Uthmeier: Special Adviser to Secretary of Commerce Noel Francisco: Principal Deputy Solicitor General Greg Katsas: Deputy Counsel to the President David Morrell: Associate Counsel to the President. In addition, Kaytlin Roholt will be special counsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee. “This is very good news for Jones Day and the lawyers remaining at the firm,” the blog’s David Lat wrote. “It’s great for the firm’s prestige, and it also means that JD lawyers will be eagerly sought after by clients with issues pending before their former colleagues.” MORE WHITE HOUSE STAFF: — Rob Porter, assistant to the president and staff secretary — Sean Cairncross, Deputy assistant to the president and senior adviser to the chief of staff — Justin Clark, deputy assistant to the president and director of intergovernmental affairs — Gerrit Lansing, deputy assistant to the president and chief digital officer — Sarah Huckabee Sanders, deputy assistant to the president and principal deputy press secretary — Michael Ambrosini, special assistant to the president and director of the office of the chief of staff — Alexander Angelson, special assistant to the president for legislative affairs — Avrahm (Avi) Berkowitz, special assistant to the president and assistant to Jared Kushner — Steven Cheung, special assistant to the president and assistant communications director — Boris Epshteyn, special assistant to the president and assistant communications director for surrogate operations —Helen Aguirre Ferre, special assistant to the president and director of media affairs — Stephanie Grisham, special assistant to the president and deputy press secretary — Mallory Hunter, special assistant to the president and executive assistant to the chief of staff — Cliff Sims, special assistant to the president and assistant communications director for White House message strategy — Lindsay Walters, special assistant to the president and deputy press secretary and adviser to the press secretary — Madeleine Westerhout, special assistant to the president and executive assistant to the president. HIT ME WITH A TWEET: Companies and industry groups are turning to lobbyists to prepare for the possibility of Trump’s Twitter attacks, reports The Hill’s Megan Wilson and Melanie Zanona. “It comes up in every meeting — what has Trump tweeted on this? How would you respond? How would you ... prevent that from happening?” said Jeff MacKinnon, a Republican lobbyist at Farragut Partners. Trump has used social media to criticize American businesses like pharmaceutical companies and GM. In turn, many shops around Washington are telling their clients to fight back. NEW FINTECH GROUP: Financial technology companies Affirm, Betterment, Digit, Envestnet, Yodlee, Kabbage, Personal Capital, Ripple and Varo Money have formed a new trade group Consumer Financial Data Rights focused on consumer financial data access, POLITICO Pro’s Colin Wilhelm reports. The group’s first course of action: To send a joint letter to the Federal Reserve and other regulators proposing cybersecurity practices for financial institutions and third-party companies providing services to the financial system. OPEN SKIES: Mike Korens, a lobbyist for Emirates Airlines, sent Donald Trump’s team a position paper recommending the administration take several positions expanding Open Skies agreements with other nations — a move that would favor Gulf carriers including Etihad Airways and Qatar Airways, in a fight with U.S. airlines, PI alum Brianna Gurciullo reports for POLITICO Pro. Jill Zuckman, a strategist at SKDKnickerbocker said it's "extremely troubling that an agent of a foreign government would be trying to shape U.S. policy to benefit a foreign, state-owned company at the expense of hard-working Americans." STAFFING HOLES: “We’re wrapping up this transition on schedule and under budget,” Vice President Mike Pence said. But that picture is incomplete and misleading, POLITICO’s Matthew Nussbaum and Eli Stokols report. So far, just 4 percent of the top positions that require Senate confirmations have been filled; a slew of senior positions throughout the federal government and major agencies remain empty; and there are major concerns on high-level positions being filled without enough consultation. "If in two weeks these basic positions aren't filled, it gets real ugly," said one veteran of the George W. Bush White House, who requested anonymity to speak freely. "You need some of these people in place, the legislative affairs people and general counsels, for instance." DONOR CLASS: Wealthy donors who gave at least $250,000 to this year’s inaugural committee, are getting VIP treatment and access to President Donald Trump at private soirees and balls, despite once bashing him during the campaign, Matea Gold reports for The Washington Post. “They are blown away and their expectations have been surpassed, and I think the reason for that is no one expected or anticipated that the vice president-elect and president-elect would be attending all these events and be so involved with them,” said Roy Bailey, a Texas investor who co-chaired the inaugural fundraising effort. “It just created this buzz that’s fantastic. For all the donors and underwriters, it’s just a real treat.” WHO’S GAMING WHO? While it seems President Donald Trump is pulling the strings on big corporations’ next moves like Wal-Mart, General Motors and pharmaceutical giant Bayer, savvy CEOs are actually one step ahead, Joe Nocera writes for Bloomberg View. “You're always going to have to let Trump appear to be the winner when you meet with him, but if you're willing to stroke his ego, you'll get what you want. That's what companies are learning. And taking advantage of.” SPOTTED at the Americans for Tax Reform gala at The Arts Club of Washington: Maria Bartiromo, Fox Business Network, Fox News Channel; Michelle Caruso-Cabrera, CNBC; Rep.

A Moffat County Sheriff’s deputy was able to locate the vehicle that ran and a male party was arrested for driving under the influence of drugs, careless driving, open alcohol container, possession of illegal drugs, failure to report an accident and leaving the scene of an accident after striking another vehicle. 2:09 p.m.: At the Moffat County Courthouse, officers responded to a report of a drunk pedestrian. The reporting party thought a male subject who had a possible bond restriction for alcohol was intoxicated. The subject tested zero for alcohol levels with a breath test. 3:20 p.m.: On the 500 block of School Street, officers responded to a report of a burglary. A male party reported his ex-girlfriend broke into his apartment while he was out and he saw her leaving by the fire escape. He reported they are currently in a custody battle but found nothing missing and requested she be warned. An officer contacted the female party. 5:33 p.m.: On the 1300 block of Yampa Avenue, officers responded to a report of fraud. Someone received a call from Washington, D.C. telling her that someone is using her identity. She wasn’t able to call back on the number given and determined the call was likely a scam. 6:11 p.m.: At the Museum of Northwest Colorado, officers responded to a report of a suspicious person standing close to the exterior wall of the building. It turned out the person had plugged their phone into an exterior outlet and was trying to make a call. 6:37 p.m.: At Veterans for Foreign Wars Post 4265, officers responded to a report of a suspicious vehicle. The building was closed but the party was simply waiting for other parties to arrive for a meeting. 8:38 p.m.: At Walmart, officers responded to a traffic accident between a Dodge pickup and a white sedan. One driver was issued a careless driving citation. 9:09 p.m.: On the 700 block of Yampa Avenue, officers responded to a report of a theft. While the reporting party was staying with another party, he received a letter from a relative with a Target gift card in it, which he found was missing. 11:12 p.m.: On the 500 block of Pershing Street, officers responded to a report of a suspicious male party at the post office. The man was in the lobby, which is open 24 hours. “A lot of our homeless population goes in there at night,” an officer explained.

Loyd spoke out of turn and was defiant during the appearance on charges of killing his pregnant ex-girlfriend. He was injured during his arrest Tuesday night following a weeklong manhunt. (Red Huber/Orlando Sentinel via AP, Pool) Tweet Change text size for the story Print Report an error Related Stories Reward raised for capture of accused cop killer 2 accused of helping fugitive in cop killing Suspect was wearing body armour Suspected cop killer spews expletives at judge Accused Orlando cop killer Markeith Loyd appears determined — and destined — to join the damned on Florida’s death row. In his second court appearance on charges of murdering police Lt. Debra Clayton, Loyd shouted expletives, interrupted the judge and refused to answer questions about the Jan. 9 execution-style shooting of the gutsy cop outside an Orlando Walmart. During the brief two-minute appearance Friday, the accused killer oozed contempt. When the judge asked his name, Loyd was tight-lipped. “I recognize you from yesterday. Corrections, is this Mr. Loyd, Markeith Loyd?” Judge Jeannette Bigney asked. Loyd snorted back: “May I have your name, please? Your name is, ma’am?” Before she could answer, he interrupted: “Will you state your name for the record, please, ma’am?” The judge replied: “Good luck to you, Mr. Loyd.” Loyd — a lifelong petty criminal — also announced in court he planned to represent himself. He was arrested for the murders of his pregnant ex-girlfriend, Sade Dixon, and Clayton, who was off duty, after a week-long manhunt that ended in a squalid abandoned home. Cops described the slaying of their sister officer as a cold-blooded execution and Loyd as a “dirtbag.” Among the charges he faces are: First-degree murder, attempted first-degree murder of a law enforcement officer, carjacking, aggravated assault, and wearing a bulletproof vest while committing an offence. A quick scan of Loyd’s Facebook page paints the portrait of an egomaniacal knucklehead with a twisted sense of self. Standing 6-foot-2, weighing 200 pounds and sporting bulging muscles, the accused killer was an intimidating figure in the hard-scrabble neighbourhood where he grew up. “If things don’t go his way, he gets very angry,” one source told the Orlando Sentinel, adding that Loyd is “very smart.” But Dixon’s heartbroken mother, Stephanie Dixon-Daniels, has nothing but contempt for Loyd. “I never liked this man. Never,” Dixon-Daniels said outside court Thursday. “He was not welcome at my house from the get-go. From the time I met him, he was never welcome.” Before mom-of-two Dixon was killed on Dec. 13, Loyd posted on Facebook: “Goals!!!! To be on Americas most wanted.” On the day of the murder, like a low-rent Tony Robbins, he told the world it was “Time to power back up. And still another post reads: “Orlando Fla., when you talk about street legends mention ME!!!! ME!!!! Y’all know what is real, n---a turned into a man with time. Love y’all.” But far from being the arch-criminal he liked to boast about being, Loyd was arrested more than 20 times over the last two decades — including a murder beef. On a drug charge, he was sentenced to 10 years. The Florida State’s Attorney office has not yet determined whether they will be seeking the death penalty, although American legal experts speculate it’s a good bet that if convicted he’ll end up in the state’s death row in Starke. And from there, a one-way ticket to oblivion.

By The BDN Editorial Board Posted Jan. 20, 2017, at 12:33 p.m. Related stories Inside the isolation of the first refugee family to be resettled in small-town Maine Economists, business leaders and politicians agree that immigration is key to reversing or at least stopping rural Maine’s population losses. And some rural towns and businesses have already started looking to immigration to improve their numbers. But the experience of the Kalutas, the first refugee family to be resettled in a small Maine town rather than a city, shows that newcomers need more than jobs and housing if they are going to stay and contribute long term. They also need initial support with transportation, help connecting with the local community and opportunities to learn English and advance in life. In August, the Kaluta family — 15 people from the Democratic Republic of Congo — was resettled by Catholic Charities Maine to Thomaston, population 2,781, because a nursing home there had jobs for them and agreed to provide housing and transportation to and from work. Because of Maine’s workforce shortage, their employer, DLTC Health Care, which operates a chain of long-term care facilities, had been unable to find enough employees to hire in the local community. Although the Kaluta family members have jobs and housing, their lives in Thomaston are tenuous, as a recent Maine Focus article details. In December, just four months into their time in Thomaston, one family member — 21-year-old Thomas — left for Portland because he was frustrated by the isolation and lack of opportunities. And while the 14 family members who remain are grateful to have jobs and an apartment, they feel stuck and isolated. “It’s a complicated equation,” Jordan, 36, the head of the family, told the BDN. Maine can learn from the Kalutas’ experience. First, if this resettlement experiment is to be repeated, the family members will need someone they can trust who speaks at least one of their languages and who can answer their questions — how to use a thermostat, what to expect of life in the small town, who is eligible to enroll in school — to help them adjust to a new and foreign life. The Kalutas did have a caseworker from Catholic Charities who spoke one of their languages, Swahili, but he was located over 70 miles away in Portland. And the family didn’t trust him because he rarely answered their calls and he visited them only twice in Thomaston after they moved, according to the family. Second, refugee families will need their own transportation, to allow them to buy groceries, visit friends and get to work. When the weather was warm, the Kalutas occasionally walked the 3 miles from their home to Wal-Mart. Catholic Charities doesn’t normally instruct refugees how to drive or take the written driving test, but in a rural area without reliable public transportation it’s crucial. Maine communities hoping to bolster their populations through immigration could learn from New Brunswick, Canada, where a refugee family from Syria arrived in July 2016, the same month the Kalutas came to Maine. The father of the family, Khalid Raslan, had no driving experience, but community volunteers taught him. By November he had a license. Third, local areas hoping to welcome refugees need to be prepared to meet their needs. In the case of the Kalutas, faith, education and business leaders did not know in advance that the family was coming. If they had, they could have pooled resources and decided earlier how to help. They could have been there to welcome the family upon arrival, to make them feel at home and to let them know nearby help was available. The situation the Kalutas are in is working for their employer: The nursing home now has five people in positions it was otherwise unable to fill. But whether the situation can work for the family themselves — and for other families in the future — remains to be seen. “I have this confidence in refugee families,” Randy Capps, the director of research for U.S. programs at the research group the Migration Policy Institute, told the BDN. “They’ve been through so much. If they’re given a fair shake, they’re going to do well.” To better ensure success for future refugee families, more coordination and support is needed to help them make the enormous transition from life in a refugee camp to life in small town Maine.   SEE COMMENTS → Previous story:« How can we predict the climate years out when next week’s forecast is so uncertain?

Executives gathered in the Swiss resort for the World Economic Forum this week keep repeating, like a soothing mantra, that Donald Trump is at heart a pragmatist who will avoid trade wars and regulations that make it harder to do business. “What somebody’s saying is not necessarily what they’re going to do,” said David Cote, chief executive officer of Honeywell International Inc. He should hope so: Honeywell is a global manufacturing giant with far more employees outside the U.S. than in, and it has made major bets on projects like supplying parts for China’s first commercial jet. With stock markets nearing record highs and business-friendly figures like billionaire investor Wilbur Ross named to the cabinet, a conviction has set in that a man who came to power as an anti-establishment populist might in fact usher in a golden age for business. “In the end if he knows the facts, he’ll respond according to the facts,” said Hideaki Omiya, chairman of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. The stakes are high for companies that have prospered during the era of globalization, locating factories where labor’s cheap and finding suppliers that can offer components at the most competitive prices. Trump has criticized the arrangements that make those integrated operations possible, calling the North American Free Trade Agreement -- which has allowed automakers like Ford Motor Co. to build supply chains spanning the length of the continent -- a “disaster.” During his campaign, Trump blasted the multilateral economic and political order, saying China, the most important U.S. trading partner, had been allowed “to rape our country.” ‘One Liners’ Companies shouldn’t sweat the president’s “one-liners” and instead should focus on Trump’s cabinet nominees, said Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase & Co. “I think that these very rational people will be very thoughtful when they go about the actual policy.”  Foreign companies say they’re similarly relaxed; Nissan Motor Co.’s co-CEO, Hiroto Saikawa, said he doesn’t believe Trump has any intention of severing trade ties that benefit the U.S. Some political veterans say the Davos set is being naïve. Larry Summers, a Treasury Secretary under President Bill Clinton, is puzzled by the shifting views on Trump and cautions against “enabling” the new administration. “I’ve been very troubled by the attitude of business people from the U.S.,” Summers said. “People who were terribly afraid of what this would mean for America’s place in the world are now hailing those who surround Donald Trump as great geniuses.” Phil Levy, a senior fellow at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs and adviser to former President George W. Bush, said executives shouldn’t entirely discount what Trump says. Past presidents, he notes, have been careful to avoid proclamations they don’t intend to stand behind.  “Usually when somebody who’s been elected president makes threats, people take it seriously,” Levy said. The healthcare industry has a more delicate task than most in making its case to Trump. Earlier this month he accused drugmakers of “getting away with murder” through high prices, and broke with traditional Republican policy by suggesting the government could use its purchasing power to rein in costs. Drugmakers, though, argue they need to charge what they do to reward the risks they face and to cover the cost of research. True North One of them, Merck KGaA CEO Stefan Oschmann, said he’s “convinced that the U.S. is a market that values innovation.” Besides, he said, pharmaceutical companies employ thousands of highly paid researchers in cities like Boston and San Diego, “a huge share of the value chain of drug-making.” The most important business stories of the day.

You will now receive the Game Plan newsletter Executives looking for ways to avoid confrontation with Trump will try to highlight those arguments, on the assumption that his main concern is U.S. economic growth and employment, rather than ideology. Winning his support may not take much: he took to Twitter to praise Wal-Mart Stores Inc. for a “big jobs push back into the U.S.” after the retailer announced 10,000 new positions that in fact represented a slowdown in growth plans compared with previous years. “This is all about jobs in the U.S.,” said Novartis AG CEO Joe Jimenez. “That will be the True North, and everything else will follow that.” The ultimate test of whether Trump implements his stated policies may be their impact on U.S. consumers, who’ve grown accustomed to cheap products made abroad. The U.S. in 2015 imported $2.2 trillion of goods and exported $1.5 trillion. The country ran trade deficits of $367 billion with China and $61 billion with Mexico, its largest and third-biggest trading partners, respectively. There are already signs, however, that Trump is preparing for a wholesale overhaul of trade that goes well beyond rhetoric. He’s created a National Trade Council to advise him, picking Peter Navarro, a professor at the University of California at Irvine and a sharp China critic, to run it. Some Davos attendees were prepared to concede that optimism about Trump is built, at least in part, on wishful thinking. “I don’t think anyone likes the unpredictability he brings to the table,” said Martin Eurnekian, a director at Buenos Aires-based conglomerate Corporacion America. “Everybody wants to believe,” he said, “that it’s mostly for show.” For more on Davos, see our special report on the World Economic Forum 2017.

ACCUSED COP-KILLER CURSES OUT JUDGE, SAYS HE'LL REPRESENT HIMSELF The bullet from the fatal shot appeared to be impacted by concrete, suggesting that Lt. Debra Clayton was on her back, according to the affidavit. Loyd kept asking judge "could u state your name for the record ma'am" while she asked if he wants a lawyer #fox35 pic.twitter.com/I0TZlqwjjQ— Jackie Orozco (@ReporterJackie) January 20, 2017 Security video showed Markeith Loyd running out of the store and Clayton pursuing him about 10 feet behind after the lieutenant was told by a Walmart customer that Loyd was wanted in the fatal shooting of his pregnant ex-girlfriend last month. ORLANDO NIGHTCLUB GUNMAN'S WIFE PLEADS NOT GUILTY, BLOWS A KISS IN COURT Loyd took cover behind a concrete pillar and fired at Clayton, striking and fracturing her hip. Clayton was on her back when Loyd approached her, the affidavit said. "Clayton fires her weapon from her back seven times at the suspect as he stands over her firing," the affidavit said. Clayton was promoted from sergeant to lieutenant after her death. The affidavit said Loyd had on a bulletproof vest, and he was wearing body armor when he was arrested Tuesday night. Loyd told detectives that the fatal shooting might not have happened if the lieutenant "had waited for backup." "She pulled her gun out first," Loyd told detectives, according to the affidavit. Loyd, 41, claimed self-defense when asked by detectives about the killing his ex-girlfriend, Sade Dixon. The suspect appeared in court Friday for five charges related to Clayton's killing and he was more subdued than the day before when he appeared on charges related to Dixon's killing, though Loyd still interrupted and refused to answer questions. In Clayton's shooting, Loyd faces charges of first-degree murder, attempted first-degree murder of a law enforcement officer, carjacking, aggravated assault and wearing a bulletproof vest while committing an offense. The judge set no bond for the first three charges, guaranteeing that Loyd will stay in jail until his trial. Loyd appeared defiant throughout Friday's hearing, which lasted less than two minutes. When the judge asked for Loyd's name, he was silent. "I recognize you from yesterday. Corrections, is this Mr. Loyd, Markeith Loyd?" Judge Jeanette Bigney said. Then, as Bigney read the new charges, Loyd interrupted, "May I have your name, please?" When the judge asked if Loyd would like a public defender to represent him, he said, "Your name is, ma'am?" Loyd's went on a profanity-laced rant Thursday that ended when he said "f--- you" to the judge. He also said he plans to represent himself. Loyd was injured by officers while being taken into custody at an abandoned house. Orlando Police Chief John Mina said a use-of-force investigation is being done, although no officer has been placed on leave. Loyd had bandages over his left eye in court Friday. As the judge told corrections officers that Loyd hadn't filled out paperwork and noted that it seemed he didn't want to, Loyd interrupted again, asking, "Will you state your name for the record, please, ma'am?" The judge said, "Good luck to you, Mr. Loyd," ending the court appearance.

Follow Raw Story! Follow @rawstory HUNTINGTON, INDIANA―For two years, after the birth of her daughter, Anna Glasgow, 24, attended high school in the morning and then worked an eight-hour shift at McDonald’s. She says the public schools in this Northern Indiana town of 17,000 are good, but “there is a huge dropout rate because people just want to go into a factory and make money.” The first day of her senior year Glasgow quit school. She had been relying on family to help with childcare. “I didn’t want to depend on my mom. I have to do it on my own.” With the father of her child locked up, Glasgow landed a job as a machine operator in a fiberglass factory. “It was strenuous work, making car doors and hoods. I enjoyed it.” At first she broke out in rashes from the fiberglass. “The fiberglass cuts your skin, but you get used to it.” In the summer the temperature in the factory could soar to 120 degrees. “On a hot day, one or two people would pass out. Usually people in their 50s and 60s.” In 2013, she jumped shipped to the Carrier Corporation plant in Huntington. Currently earning $14.83 an hour, Glasgow says, “When I first started, I was money hungry, I worked as much as 83 hours a week.” In February 2016, Carrier announced the plant would shut down this year, eliminating 738 workers as it shifts production to Monterrey, Mexico. Glasgow is staring at being jobless for the first time since she was 16. “I’ve started to get nervous. I’ve never had to apply for unemployment. I have to get on Medicare to cover my daughter and baby boy.” Glasgow, who “grew up dirt poor, sometimes eating ramen noodles for a week,” is optimistic about her future. She plans to get married later this year to her fiance, a U.S. Army Vet who served in Afghanistan. They live together in a house they bought with a Veterans Affair loan three years ago. She is studying to become a dental hygienist in addition to working. Because Carrier is paying for education, she says she will collect unemployment, concentrate on her studies, and “spend every minute available with my kids.” On a mild January day, Glasgow and six other Carrier workers gathered in the hall of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers 983 in Huntington. The Carrier plant, which manufactures control panels for air-conditioners, heating, and ventilation units, is slated to close shop in June. Some, like Brad Woodring, 58, have spent their entire worklife at the plant. With 39 years at Carrier, Woodring says, “I thought it would be there forever, long after I retired. I have no ill feelings toward Carrier because they’ve been good to us.” Woodring is one of 17 factory workers in Indiana interviewed by the Raw Story who are losing their jobs as production shifts to Mexico. Their stories became a national sensation when Donald Trump Tweeted about the two companies behind the offshoring, Carrier and Rexnord, vowing “No more!” Woodring, who voted for Trump “because under the circumstances he was the right man for the job,” says, “I was excited when Trump started tweeting, but tried not to get my hopes up. I have faith in God and he’s going to get me through this.” But he hints at worries about what’s next. “I’m in limbo because I have to go out there and find something else. I am diabetic and have to take medication for that.” Other veteran workers like Terri Browning, 55, who has put in 30 years, said as she listened to the announcement that the plant was being shuttered, “The first words that came into my head, were WTF, what the firecracker, that is.” She is looking at transitioning to retirement early. “I called my husband and told him we may be going to Florida sooner than we think.” But Browning is worried about being able to sell their house in a depressed market. Even if they can move to the Tampa area as planned, she will still need a job. “I can flip hamburgers. My biggest concern is health insurance. I have chronic issues, and I am a two-time cancer survivor. That’s why I am looking at some type of manufacturing; 90% have some type of insurance.” All told the three Carrier and Rexnord plants are shedding 1,600 union jobs. After Trump’s intervention, the Carrier plant in Indianapolis will retain 730 union jobs, but no one knows for how long, and union officials say they don’t expect to see any details of the deal. Steelworkers Local 1999 will shrink by a third as more than 1,000 workers lose their jobs, while the IBEW local will wink out of existence as their entire membership consists of the 738 workers at Carrier. The prediction that NAFTA would lead to a “giant sucking sound” of jobs fleeing to cheap labor markets in Mexico has come true to pass for hundreds of thousands of factory workers in the Midwest. And the effects radiate outward. Terri Browning says it’s not just 700 people losing their jobs in the Huntington area. “Any extracurricular activities your kids are in are going to stop. There is going to be less eating out, money is not going to be there for United Way, March of Dimes.” Glasgow says she likes that Huntington is a small town “where you know everyone or know of them.” But it’s “kind of boring” she says, with not much to do beyond teenage amusements like a bowling lane, skating rink, and a movie theater. She says the town is “starting to get filled with drugs, cocaine, crack, heroin. A lot of friends from high school have died of drug overdoses, five or six of them.” THE NEW ECONOMY The agent at a rental car counter at the Indianapolis airport declares with pride that the state capitol “has the second-most war memorials in the country. Washington, D.C., is first. We take care of our vets.” There are no memorials for Indiana’s manufacturing past, but Carrier and Rexnord workers can rattle off the companies that have left Indiana for Mexico, China, and elsewhere: Ford, Pratt & Whitney, RCA, Navistar, Alcoa, Piles Speakers, GM. As manufacturing flees, the population of Northern Indiana towns like Huntington, Marion, South Bend, or Gary have not grown or declined precipitously since 1990. Indiana was spared the worst of the housing crisis, but that limited any rebound. Home prices have stagnated in numerous pockets, reducing the incentive to buy a home as it returns little if any investment. The economic model for the capitol in Indianapolis is the cookie-cutter mold of “creative” industries such as higher education, biotech, and finance tied to high-end living. Downtown boasts the Chase Tower, pharmaceutical research labs for Eli Lilly, $2,550 apartments for rent, craft-beer bars, and office workers crowding the Indianapolis City Market at lunch. Traveling west toward the Steelworkers hall, after passing under a blue railroad bridge, maintenance declines instantly. Roads are rutted, grass is reclaiming the sidewalks, and the street is lined with modest Mexican restaurants, money transfer-services, beauty salons, and tire shops. A block past the “dancing girls live” at Patty’s Showclub, the electronic sign at George Washington Community High School reads, “No Hay Classes” in advance of Martin Luther King Jr. Day. According to Marquita Walker, associate professor of labor studies at Indiana University, more than 13,000 manufacturing jobs have been lost in the Indianapolis region out of nearly 70,000 that existed in 2006. The loss is much starker as the economy has grown substantially. Blue-collar jobs have plunged from 12 percent of available jobs a decade ago to 7.6 percent today. Indiana is typical of many post-industrial cities in that the economy is now dominated by education, finance, professional and business services, government, and healthcare. It reflects the split between low-wage service sector work and well-paid jobs in the knowledge economy. Down the street from two-story wooden homes with windows sealed with plastic to ward off winter and American and Confederate flags snapping in the wind, sits USW Local 1999’s hall, a rectangular brick-faced building stuck in the crook of a road next to railroad tracks. Next to a large events hall, union leaders hang out in a conference room fielding media phone calls and interviews. Workers filter into the union hall before and before shifts at Carrier and Rexnord. They talk of the difficulty of surviving in the low-wage sector. Workers bank on retraining or a college degree, which either the companies or Indiana state will pay for, to give them a leg up in the creative, hi-tech, and service industries. Don Zering, 62, president of the USW local 1999 unit at Rexnord, says education isn’t the issue, “What’s the pay going to be? You take $10 an hour in pay. People are going to lose their houses, they’re going to lose their cars.” Many workers own their own homes, most younger ones are not overly concerned about their prospects, and older ones are trying to hang out until Medicare and Social Security kicks in. But there is a pervasive feeling that the path to a secure career and retirement is eroding in front of them and narrowing behind them. Some were swamped by the Great Recession. John Feltner, 47, vice president of the USW unit at Rexnord, lost his job at Navistar in 2008 when it was shuttered. “I lost everything. I had a very nice home. Lost it. Cars were repo-ed. We’ve been renting ever since.” He calls the East side of Indianapolis a “war zone,” saying that’s why he moved his family further away. Brian Hunter, 41, who’s put in 16 years at Rexnord says, “I’m young enough to go out there and get something. I could lose my truck. I don’t want to lose my home. The hard part is looking your kid in the eye and telling them you can’t play this sport because we can’t afford it right now, you can’t have what everyone else is having.” The same is true for Travis Michael, 40, who has worked at the Huntington plant for 19 years and conducts testing and packing of electronic control panels. “My biggest worry is paying for my son’s college. I’ll find another manufacturing job. If not, go back to school for a certificate in computerized numerical control machining or welding.” But they are only a few steps away from the lowest rungs of the economy. Michael, who voted for Trump, says, “Everyone’s going to be working at McDonald’s and Walmart. Something needs to change or we’re going to be jumping the wall and going to Mexico. He don’t need to build it quite yet.” If these workers lose their foothold in unionized factories that pay $23 an hour or more, they could slip into the Walmart and McDonald’s economy. Here desperation and poverty is the daily bread. Low-wage workers describe surviving on $25 a week for groceries and going hungry, duct taping shoes together, living one couple or one family per room in an apartment, and working injured for months out of fear of being fired if they take time off to see a doctor. They have no savings, no possibility of owning a home, and no hope of retirement. Driving along a major thoroughfare Northwest of the city sit grim concrete shopping centers that are some rubble and a crashed spaceship short of a post-apocalyptic film. Inside the Indiana Discount Mall is the changing face of America. A mostly Latin American clientele peruses stalls and small shops hawking knock-off brand clothing and toys, electronics repair, barbershops, beauty salons, and Mexican food and music. Further north, past a stretch of fast-food restaurants, gas stations, garages, dollar stores, vape shops, and the Masjid E Noor, lives Lakita Clark. The parking lot in the rental complex of homes and apartments is sprinkled with cars pocked by rust or bearing crumpled hoods and doors. Clark lives in a tidy home and is watching cable news with her four children spread out nearby, each absorbed by their own electronic device. A towel under the door blocks the rain that’s puddling grassy divides between the rowhomes. With 15 years at the Indianapolis plant, Clark will keep her job as a fabrication technician at Carrier, while 550 workers will lose theirs. She’s displeased so many jobs are being lost. Clark says while “Carrier has been good to us, when they laid everyone off, it opened your eyes. No one’s job is safe.” She is considering switching to the healthcare field, having worked in a hospital when she was younger. “In 10 years I’ll be 50. My sons have big goals. One wants to be an architect, the other wants to be a football player.” “It’s been a whole mental breakdown with the plant closing,” says Clark. “When I thought I was going to be laid off, I worried about where am I going to live at without no job and no money. How am I going to pay my rent. How am I going to make my car payment. With four kids $10 an hour is nothing to me.” Clark feels Trump’s intervention at Carrier overshadowed the role the workers played. “Me and my kids were protesting for our jobs. The seven months we protest, it was nothing.” Robert James, who has been at carrier for 18 years and is vice president of USW Local 1999, agrees. “One of our members took that video and it went viral. The steelworkers kept Carrier in the news.” Back at the steelworkers hall, Tim Mathis, 51, who works at Rexnord machining housings for ball bearings, says, “We’re not asking for anybody’s sympathy, we’re asking for people to stand with us and say no more—the bleeding’s got to stop.” Sitting in the conference room, puffing on a cigarette, Chuck Jones sees a dark future for many of the 1,600 workers who are being pushed out of the Carrier and Rexnord factories. “Guy gets laid off. One day someone comes in. He says, ‘Did you hear about Old Luke? His car got repo’ed.’ “A few months later, ‘Did you hear about old Luke? He lost his house, got foreclosed.’ “A few months after that, ‘Did you hear about old Luke? His wife left him after he lost his house. He blew his brains out.’ “I’ve heard this too many times. Very few of them who are losing their jobs are going to come out alright.” Arun Gupta contributes to The Washington Post, YES!

This week, Amazon is wooing Prime subscribers with a new, exclusive credit card, brand interest in Snapchat may not be as high as it seems, and the privacy-focused search engine DuckDuckGo is on the up-and-up, reaching a record of 14 million anonymous searches in one day. Amazon unveils new credit card exclusive to Prime members Since the launch of Amazon Prime as an express shipping service in 2005, Amazon has continued to add benefits to its exclusive subscription service in a bit to retain existing subscribers and lure new ones. The latest of these is the Amazon Prime Rewards Visa Signature Card, a new credit card exclusive to Amazon Prime members, which offers a hefty 5% cashback on all Amazon purchases, as well as a 1-2% cashback on other types of purchase, and a $70 gift card to new cardholders once they’re approved. Al Roberts covered the news for ClickZ this week, looking at how Amazon is aiming to outdo major retail rival Costco with the new card, in its bid to become the go-to retailer in the U.S. and elsewhere. More brands sign up for Snapchat, but not all are active Snapchat is currently preparing to make an Initial Public Offering that could be the largest in the social media space since Facebook’s in 2012. But although Snapchat has made a number of moves to tempt businesses into marketing on its platform, such as adding ecommerce features, redesigning its Discover platform to appeal to publishers, and adding Facebook-like audience targeting, a new report by research firm L2 has revealed that many businesses still don’t know what to do with Snapchat. According to L2, many of the brands that are signed up to Snapchat have “struggled to produce content for the platform”, and the amount of active brands on Snapchat dropped from 70% to 67% between January and October. Al Roberts reported on the news for ClickZ this week and assessed whether Snapchat will be able to build up the momentum to challenge Facebook’s social media dominance. Why the world’s major brands are making the switch to their own web extension To date, more than 550 of the world’s largest brands have applied for their own Top-Level Domains, or TLDs – the part of a URL that appears after the dot (e.g. .com or .net). Given the sizeable application fee of almost $200,000 USD, it stands to reason that most of the brands using these TLDs are big hitters like Apple, Google, Walmart and Nike, using them to create more simplified and memorable navigation that harks back to the days of Windows 2000. Tereza Litsa looked at how the new extensions work, and what the benefits are for both marketers and consumers.

But one of its biggest sources of friction relates to the sale of counterfeit goods, particularly high-end and luxury goods such as jewellery, fashion and handbags. For years, eBay has offered a Verified Rights Owner programme which lets brands report suspected fakes, but late last week it announced that it will be launching a new programme, eBay Authenticate, which is specifically targeted at sellers of luxury items. Due to roll out later this year, eBay Authenticate will allow high-end sellers to have professional authenticators evaluate their items for an as-yet unspecified fee. It also promises, subject to certain terms and conditions, to refund buyers twice the cost of the original item if merchandise they purchase is found to be counterfeit during the eBay Authenticate process. DuckDuckGo hits 14 million searches in one day The privacy-focused search engine DuckDuckGo yesterday announced two major milestones to its blog: at the end of last year, it surpassed a cumulative total of 10 billion searches served, with more than 4 billion of those carried out in 2016 alone. And earlier this month, DuckDuckGo reached an all-time high of 14 million searches in just one day. DuckDuckGo hailed this news as a success for the spread of privacy online, pointing out a Pew Research Study which reported that 40% of users believe their search engine shouldn’t retain information about their search activity. It’s definitely a huge achievement for a small, independent search engine like DuckDuckGo, which doesn’t retain any information about its users or sell it on to advertisers, and whose features are largely community-created and crowdsourced. Its presence mostly spreads by word of mouth, and yet DuckDuckGo’s traffic is growing faster than ever, which could indicate that more and more people are starting to take an interest in privacy and anonymity online.

Daniel B. Kline (TMFDankline) Jan 20, 2017 at 9:36AM Costco (NASDAQ:COST) does not make most of its money from people shopping in its stores. Instead, membership fees -- people paying either $55 a year for a regular membership or $110 for an Executive Gold Star membership -- amount to about 75% of its profit. Thus the chain's chief goal is not inching prices up in order to increase its bottom line. Instead, the company puts its efforts into making sure people sign up and renew their memberships. That means that even when Costco can raise prices on its products and still be cheaper than its rivals, it may not do that. CFO Richard Galanti called his company's stand on pricing "more extreme probably than others," and explained during the chain's Q1 2017 earnings cal how the warehouse club works to keep prices low l. He also laid out his thoughts on margins during the call, which was transcribed by Seeking Alpha (registration required). "As it relates to some different types of competition out there, the competitive pricing moat has gotten wider, which is good," he said. "We haven't used that to improve our margins consciously in that regard, the wider the better." Basically that's Galanti saying that his company has room to increase its margins, but has chosen not to. Costco makes most of its money from membership fees. Image source: author. What is Costco's pricing strategy? The warehouse club consciously pushes its suppliers to lower prices by dangling the promise of bigger orders. "We are constantly going back to every supplier with our purchasing power, with our buying power ... and competition itself with private label to figure out how can we bring the quantity up, the quality up, and the price down," Galanti explained. That's a strategy used by all big retailers. Wal-Mart, for example regularly goes back to its vendors and asks for price cuts under the idea that cheaper prices will increase sales. The difference with Costco and other retailers is that instead of using some of the savings to lower prices and some to increase profits, Costco generally uses its savings to push prices down as a way to increase sales, which in theory raises customer satisfaction leading to more membership renewals. "We're certainly not going to benefit from every extra dollar of income," said Galanti, explaining what happens after a vendor lowers prices. "We're going to figure out how to use it to drive that competitive spirit and to drive our sales." Costco takes a long view Costco has chosen a business model driven by membership. Because of that, the chain has to make what must sometimes be difficult decisions to forgo increasing its margins in favor of passing on the savings to its customers. That's a behind-the-scenes thing that shoppers don't see, but which subtly impacts their decision to renew their memberships. Costco could probably raise prices and make more money in the short term, but by playing a longer game, the chain builds loyalty. Daniel Kline has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Ward/January 19, 2017/1 comment Tweet Email Print The Ferris Woods proposal is for 60 two-bedroom senior citizen apartments built on 43 acres that would be accessed from the end of Brouck Ferris Boulevard. (photo by Lauren Thomas) Whenever a new development is proposed in New Paltz, it’s the perceived impacts on quality of life that determine how many people speak out in favor or against it. The Ferris Woods proposal is for 60 two-bedroom senior citizen apartments built on 43 acres that would be accessed from the end of Brouck Ferris Boulevard, with an emergency access route running from the back of the nearby car wash on Route 299. In this case, the proposal pits life on a quiet street against the prospect of being forced to age out of New Paltz due to a lack of affordable alternatives for senior citizens. The project was the focus of a public hearing which was opened at the January 9 meeting of the New Paltz Town Planning Board. Several residents of Brouck Ferris Boulevard came out to express worries, the most immediate of which is the expected sharp increase in traffic on the quiet dead-end road, but also impacts to what is being characterized as one of the more important wetlands in the town. Advertisement Christine Ransom lives at the end of that small road off South Ohioville, in the last house before the wooded tract that contributes to the “special setting” that she considers an “oasis” from the hustle and bustle not far away, replete with a vibrant night sky and “plenty of wildlife” that makes these woods and wetlands their home. “I may have the most to lose,” Ransom told board members, because with the access road just 14 feet from her property line, she expects to be able to read the license plates on this “parade of vehicles” through her living room window. Like others who spoke, she is expecting her pristine view of night sky to be ruined by lighting required for this complex. Another neighbor, Michelle Didonna, told board members she’d specifically searched for a dead-end street on which to buy a home. A projected 500% increase in traffic would be an “accident waiting to happen” on Brouck Ferris Boulevard, a road without sidewalks. Trending Strong local presence in women’s marches New Paltz is a de facto sanctuary community for undocumented immigrants Woodstock marchers exceed expectations tenfold In the process of getting her home daycare business licensed, neighbor Orna Gorosh said that the proposal “doesn’t feel safe,” particularly when she brings her young charges outside to walk down that now-quiet road. Didonna’s husband, Matt, was skeptical that the traffic flow would even be that low for senior housing; he wondered who would regulate the age of residents. Rather, he believes that residents of the apartments will “plow through my neighborhood to get to the business district,” which he maintains “makes no sense” per the town’s comprehensive plan. That’s because Brouck Ferris Boulevard — named to evoke “Hasbrouck,” the family that once owned all this land and more — is a minor road, not a collector road. Engineer Peter Setaro told board members that “nobody’s trying to say that there’s not an impact” on traffic, but he stressed the 55-and-over aspect, implying that people of that age simply don’t drive as often. Neighbors reached after the fact were skeptical of that assertion, and noted that those who don’t go out tend to have visitors, aides and deliveries that would likely offset any reductions in traffic. Landowner Bart Panessa did not speak during the hearing, but when reached later agreed in principle with the concern about the complex exiting onto the quiet road where he himself lives, along with some other family members in nearby homes. He told the New Paltz Times that his initial proposal was to make the route past the Diamond Car Wash the main access, and use Brouck Ferris Boulevard as the required emergency access only. Other neighbors fear for the impact on their relatively shallow wells. There’s no water or sewer infrastructure in that part of town, meaning that wells will need to be drilled and a septic field established. There are several wetlands on the property in question, and finding places to fit all the required improvements is only complicated by the town’s own wetlands law, which establishes a larger protective buffer than state or federal regulators. Both the emergency access via the car wash and the two proposed wells are shown within that buffer on the current plans. Panessa hopes that there will be sufficient water under those wetlands to sell excess to the town, to help address ongoing needs. Those who are worried that the scale of this project isn’t in keeping with the neighborhood are calling themselves the Friends of Brouck Ferris Boulevard, adding to a list of named groups speaking out against particular projects. SEED — Sustainable Exit Eighteen Development — now has a broader scope than simply opposing CVS, and includes members from throughout the community. Most of the Friends of New Paltz live near the Zero Place development and thus have intimate ties to potential impacts, but due to their numbers and gravitas those concerns are being taken seriously. Across the river, the Friends of the Shawangunks fought for months to stop approval of the Mohonk Preserve foothills project; unlike the two previously-listed groups, those “friends” were unable to garner more widespread community support of their point of view. None of the above groups are tied to the local Quaker group, the formal name of which is the New Paltz Meeting of the Society of Friends. The Friends of Brouck Ferris Boulevard don’t wish to characterize this as a dispute among neighbors; the issues, they say, do indeed impact a larger swath of the community. Those in attendance listened with keen interest to Noel Russ, a member of the town’s environmental conservation board, who told planning board members that the violations of the wetlands buffer posed a “significantly adverse impact” because it would fragment the Plutarch wetlands, habitat for “species of conservation concern.” Despite the fact that the emergency access road is one of the problems, Russ argued that it still would be better to make that the main access should the project be approved. Panessa agrees that this process can easily be collegial; he said that the project has been prepared “with family and neighbors in mind,” and that his door is “always open” to those who have questions or concerns. His family has owned that parcel for many years, and declined to sell it many times, including to Walmart and Lowe’s. As he approaches retirement age, Panessa has recognized the dearth in housing alternatives for seniors who don’t wish to maintain a large home any longer. “There’s a lot of college rentals, but if you want to stay, you have to look outside of New Paltz.” As noted, Panessa agrees that putting the entrance through to Route 299 would be preferable; he characterized himself as “absolutely ecstatic” so many people recommended that option, and that planning board chairman Mike Calimano directed his engineers to investigate it. He has also given thought to other concerns. The initial hope was that he could pay to extend water and sewer service to this lot, but “the town is not ready to do that,” necessitating the less-desirable septic and wells. Town engineer David Clouser told board members that there is “a lot riding on the soil testing,” in particular the percolation test that shows how quickly water is absorbed. That’s important for the septic design as well as storm water retention plans. No matter what board members and consultants think of this project, it could be frozen in its tracks if town board members approve a moratorium to study new zoning for this gateway to the community. On the other hand, Panessa downplayed the importance of these wetlands, particularly one seasonally wet area that is used by Central Hudson personnel to maintain power lines that run through it. Other than that portion, the project is otherwise “hundreds of feet” from designated wetlands, although it does encroach upon the buffer established under the much-contested town wetlands law. That buffer, however, “is just a line,” he said, inferring that it could have just as easily been set closer to the areas in question. Planning board member Lyle Nolan, who has been involved in crafting more than one iteration of that law before a version finally survived a court challenge, appeared less than enthused at the prospect of waiving the buffer requirement that easily. Despite the fact that any well must be built inside a wide radius of empty space controlled by the land owner, he told Panessa’s engineers, “I don’t see a good reason to move into the buffer. It took years to get this wetlands law.” When told that relocating the well would result in more trees being killed to defend a wetland that isn’t particularly high quality, Nolan replied, “I think the site is just too tight.” Wetlands notwithstanding, Panessa feels that this project is designed to be sensitive to the environment and neighbors. It’s large, yes, but very few trees would have to die to make room for it, meaning that they would remain as privacy buffers, albeit not quite as robust a wildlife habitat as other neighbors assert it is right now. Technological innovations will reduce the light pollution problem, as well: LEDs can be installed that only brighten to full intensity when a car is moving through the parking area, he said. “I get it,” Panessa said. “I live there too.” Read more stories from New Paltz Times Get the best local arts & event stories in your inbox each week You might like these New Paltz is a de facto sanctuary community for undocumented immigrants Kingston mayor doubts Trump will cut federal cash for sanctuary cities Saugerties village says it’s too costly to supply Railroad Ave. with water Check it out How a Kingston-born lawyer became the Civil War spymaster Iced over: Crossing the Hudson in winter before the bridges were built Bigfoot Researchers of the Hudson Valley There is one comment Reply Francis January 20, 2017 at 8:33 am When did people 55 and over start being labeled as senior citizens?

On Dec. 13, 2016, Loyd killed his pregnant ex-girlfriend, Sade Dixon. She had been dating Loyd for about three months and moved back into her parent’s home after a violent fight where he bit her on the back, which required a tetanus shot. Dixon was two months pregnant with Loyd’s baby. While she was eating dinner with her family, she answered a cellphone call from Loyd and agreed to meet him outside to talk. Soon family members heard arguing and as her brother walked to the door to check on his sister, he heard gunshots. When he opened the door, his sister lay mortally wounded on the ground as Loyd fired his gun at the family members and fled the scene in a vehicle. Police issued an arrest warrant for Loyd at the time on two counts of first-degree murder, two counts of aggravated assault with a firearm and one count of attempted murder. Loyd was able to elude authorities until he was spotted by a person who knew Loyd was wanted and informed Orlando police Lt. Debra Clayton at a local Walmart. When Clayton confronted and attempted to arrest Loyd, he shot and killed the officer and once again fled the scene. A massive manhunt ended this week when Loyd was found at an abandoned home he was hiding in for at least nine days. As a police helicopter loomed overhead Loyd crawled from the house and a group of officers are then seen kicking and punching Loyd as he is taken into custody. He had to spend a night in the hospital before he was taken to jail because of the injuries he received. Officers on the scene said he was resisting arrest. Now the officers involved are facing a use of force investigation as a badly beaten and bruised Loyd appeared in court on Jan. 19. Loyd was loud and outraged and screamed “F— you” to the judge as he appeared in court to hear the charges against him. Loyd further stated, “They done took my eye, broke my nose, broke my jaw … crawled out to the motherf—–g road, so how did I resist? I didn’t resist s—. They just did that s— and tried to hide it from the news people, but I’m here right now.” Loyd has been charged with first-degree murder and the unlawful killing of an unborn child in the Dec. 13 death of ex-girlfriend Sade Dixon. He is also accused of fatally shooting the cop but has not yet been charged. Loyd has decided to represent himself during this phase of the criminal proceedings.

Skip to content Naked Security Computer Security News, Advice and Research sophos.com Free Tools Go Award-winning computer security news Twitter Facebook Google+ LinkedIn Feed Alleged child molester caught after 18 years thanks to facial recognition 20 Jan 2017 1 Law & order, Privacy Post navigation Previous: School sues sysadmin for wiping its only login to Gmail Next: Meitu app is all the rage, but privacy concerns abound by Lisa Vaas 0Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit “If you want to, and you know how, you can become someone else, just like that, real easy,” Charles Hollin (note:our photo is posed by a model) bragged to his friends and coworkers, letting them know that he had the fake hair pieces and mustaches to pull it off. And then, he did just that. The suspected child kidnapper and molester disappeared, slipping away from arrest and remaining a fugitive, hiding under an identity he stole from a dead eight-year-old boy, for 18 years. But if you want to, and you know how, and you’re in the FBI, and you have access to top-secret government databases of people’s photos, you can find someone with facial recognition. The US Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Indiana announced last week that Charles Hollin, 61, aka Andrew David Hall, has been arrested and charged with unlawful flight to avoid prosecution in the January 1999 kidnapping and child molestation of a 10-year-old girl. He’s also charged with identity theft. Using the name of a boy who’d been killed in a car crash, Hollin managed to hide from the law by first moving to Minnesota, then to Oregon. As an FBI agent described in the affidavit, the death certificate for the boy – whose name was Andrew David Hall – lacked a taxpayer ID. Because that box hadn’t been filled in, Hollin was able to get the driver’s licenses, Social Security number and passport using the dead boy’s name, FBI agent Todd Prewitt wrote in the affidavit. The Indianapolis FBI bureau began running a Facial Analysis, Comparison, and Evaluation (Face) request for the fugitive in October last year. Multiple databases full of driver’s license photos were searched, but not the ones for Oregon and Minnesota: in those states, it’s prohibited by law. Sophos Home Free home computer security software for all the family Learn More That well may have slowed the FBI’s tracking of Hollin, but they got him in the end thanks to the vast, deep reservoir of images the government has amassed. How big? In August, a Government Accountability Office (GAO) report revealed that the FBI’s massive face recognition database has 30m civil and criminal mugshot photos, along with the State Department’s visa and passport databases, the Defense Department’s biometric database, and the drivers license databases of at least 16 states. In total, at the time of the GAO’s report, the FBI’s Face Services unit had access to nearly 412m million images, most of which are of US people and foreigners who have committed no crime, according to the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Some of those facial recognition databases are “top secret”, according to court documents. Agent Prewitt wrote this in the affidavit: The Department of Motor Vehicles for Minnesota and Oregon were not searched due to the fact that it was prohibited by law. Additional searches were conducted in various federal secret and top secret databases. All of these searches were negative. It was Hollin’s passport application photo that gave him away. He had filed the application in 2007, again under the dead boy’s name, in order to travel to China. Just before Christmas, the FBI’s Face search hit on it as a possible match, comparing it to photos of Hollin taken before he disappeared. That led to a birth certificate for Hall that, starting in 1999, was linked to an Indiana PO box address. The PO box address was located about 10 miles from where Hollin was living before he disappeared. Hollin will be returned to Indiana, where he’s accused in the January 1999 kidnapping and sexual molestation of a 10-year-old girl after allegedly approaching her outside a girls club and asking her for help in retrieving keys from his car. Hollin was eventually traced to his job, working at a Walmart in Salem, Oregon, and was arrested last week. He’s not the only long-running fugitive who’s been tracked down with the use of facial recognition. In August 2014, the FBI caught Neil Stammer, a child sex abuse suspect who’d been hiding out in Nepal and who’d been on the run for 14 years. Catching suspected child predators is a positive for facial recognition, but the debate about the increasingly widespread use of this new technology rumbles on – in particular, about the absence of rules that would protect privacy. In June, the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) joined with a coalition of 45 organizations to urge Congress to hold a hearing on the FBI’s biometric database and the risks of facial recognition technology, which include false positives and the risk of law enforcement misusing the technology. Case in point: in November 2012, a former police officer was awarded just over $1m after she filed suits charging privacy invasion against fellow officers who illegally accessed her driver’s license photo and address more than 500 times. That happened in Minnesota, by the way: one of the states where it’s now illegal to search driver’s license image databases.

One comment on “Alleged child molester caught after 18 years thanks to facial recognition” John Bryan says: January 21, 2017 at 10:30 am This really shows what could be the bensfit from legitimate state use of biometric data. But without controls can you imagine how this would have been used in the days of McCarthy. Just being seen near a protest would get you identified and banned from government work and other industries. How the data is collected, stored should have strict judicial oversigt and use should have judicial control. After all McCarthyism was just a swing in political mood, something like that could easily happen again. Use for this purpose is great, it is restricting the who and why of it’s use that is of concern. Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Enter your comment here...

A criminal complaint identifies the victim of the early Tuesday morning homicide as Joel Dean Gangness. Authorities said Gangness was found dead inside his apartment at the old Star Motel building, 3901 First Ave., shortly before 10 a.m. Tuesday. An autopsy determined that he had been stabbed multiple times. Benjamin David Lundquist, 32, was arraigned Thursday morning in St. Louis County District Court in Hibbing on a charge of intentional second-degree murder. Authorities said he admitted to stabbing Gangness in the back 15 times and hitting him over the head with a DVD player. District Judge David Ackerson granted the St. Louis County attorney’s office’s request to set Lundquist’s bail at $1 million. The judge also indicated that a mental health evaluation likely will be ordered at some point. Police were called to the residence on Tuesday when it was reported that Gangness, a carrier for the Hibbing Daily Tribune, had not made his newspaper deliveries that morning. A co-worker and his family had been unable to get a hold of him. Authorities said Gangness was found deceased on the floor with a number of injuries, including apparent stab wounds. Blood was found in a number of locations.

Another tenant reported seeing a “strange male” wandering around the parking lot that night and showed investigators several footprints in the snow. Investigators said they visited the Lucky Seven gas station next door and learned that the night staff had become suspicious of a man who had been in and near the store for several hours that night. Surveillance video showed the man wandering around the store, exiting and re-entering before making a purchase, according to the complaint. Police learned that a credit card used in the purchase was registered to Lundquist and that he also stopped at the Hibbing Walmart at approximately 2 a.m., the charges state. The man shown in surveillance video from both stores appeared to match the description given by the tenants, investigators said. Law enforcement went to Lundquist’s Grand Rapids apartment, where they found footprints matching those outside the Hibbing apartment building, according to the charges. A notice was issued to area agencies, and Lundquist was taken into custody outside a convenience store in Nashwauk. Investigators said he appeared to have dried blood on his blue jeans, which he claimed to be his own. Lundquist agreed to a formal interview at Hibbing Police Department headquarters and initially stated that he had not been to Hibbing in months, according to the complaint. When shown a picture of Gangness, he denied knowing him. When Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension agents showed the defendant images from the surveillance videos, Lundquist allegedly admitted that he had been dropped off at the Lucky Seven gas station. He stated that he went into the store and waited, then walked to Walmart and eventually Keewatin, according to the complaint. After initially denying that he visited the apartment building, investigators said Lundquist stated, “I did it.” He allegedly went on to say that there was a fight and that he stabbed a male, whom he did not know, because “Jesus directed him to do it.” He said he chose door No. 12 because “everything came to 12,” according to the charges. Lundquist stated that he “at first didn’t think he would kill him,” but then “lost it” and hit him with the DVD player. He said Gangness tried to run toward the door and that he grabbed a knife and stabbed him 15 times, according to the complaint. Gangness allegedly admitted to stealing a bobblehead and box cutter, which police said were recovered during his arrest. He also said he took a cellphone, which he later discarded, according to the charges. Lundquist made a brief court appearance on the charge Thursday. He calmly recited his name, address and birthdate, but did not otherwise speak.   Tags:  Crime Minnesota Tom Olsen As you comment, please be respectful of other commenters and other viewpoints.

Arise News – ARISE News is a 24 hour international television news channel … Trump Assumes Office In a Storm of Controversy News Analysis Okechukwu Uwaezuoke with agency reports By noon (local time) today, Donald John Trump assumes office as the most unpopular newly-elected American president in at least four decades. Two polls, released on Tuesday, agree on the fact that the billionaire, who becomes the 45th American president, holds the lowest approval ratings record in recent memory. Indeed, both ABC News/Washington Post and CNN/ORC polls showed he had dismally poor approval ratings. According to these polls, just 40 per cent of Americans view him favourably. The former rates his six predecessors as follows: Jimmy Carter (78 per cent), Ronald Reagan (58 per cent), George H.W. Bush (65 per cent), Bill Clinton (68 per cent), George W. Bush (62 per cent) and Obama (79 per cent), while the latter rated Clinton (67 per cent), George W Bush (61 per cent) and Obama (84 per cent). Meanwhile, Trump has dismissed the polls as “phony” and “rigged”, arguing in a tweet: “The same people who did the phony election polls, and were so wrong, are now doing approval rating polls. They are rigged just like before.” Indeed, the same survey had said that 44 per cent of Americans believe that Trump is qualified to serve as president, while a majority (52 per cent) say he is not. While on the campaign trail last year, Trump had frequently blasted them out on Twitter. This was even when they had good news for him. But he would accuse media organisations of rigging the numbers when they showed him behind his rivals. On the eve of the general election, Trump narrowly trailed his main rival, the Democratic Party nominee, Hillary Clinton. The latter hovered anywhere from 2 to 4 percentage points over her Republican rival. Curiously, Trump captured the Electoral College to win the presidency, while Clinton won the popular vote by nearly 2.9 million (65,844,954 to 62,979,879) — an advantage of slightly more than 2 per cent. Add to Trump’s unenviable record-the fact that his cabinet will be the first without a single Latino member since the Ronald Reagan administration. The Washington Post says that every previous administration has had a secretary or top ambassador of Latino descent. This began with Reagan’s appointment of Lauro Cavazos as education secretary in the waning months of his presidency in 1988. The Post also observed that “Trump’s Cabinet won’t have a Democrat, just three women, one African-American man—and no Latino.” A feud between the newly elected president and the civil rights’ icon and congressman, John Lewis, has led to a rising number of Democratic lawmakers planning to boycott his inauguration. Already, over 50 House Democrats have confirmed that they will not witness Trump’s swearing-in ceremony as the 45th US president. To Lewis’s assertion last Friday that Trump’s inauguration would be the first one he would miss since being elected to Congress in the 1980s, Trump pointed to Lewis’ absence from George W. Bush’s inauguration in 2001. “John Lewis said about my inauguration, ‘It will be the first one that I’ve missed.’ WRONG (or lie)!” Trump tweeted Tuesday morning. “He boycotted Bush 43 also because he… thought it would be hypocritical to attend Bush’s swearing-in….he doesn’t believe Bush is the true elected president.’ Sound familiar! WP”. “WP” in Trump’s tweet is an allusion to the Washington Post, which in its January 21, 2001 edition had reported that Lewis was among a group of Congressional Black Caucus members who had decided to boycott George W. Bush’s first inauguration. Bush’s ascension to office was tarnished by a contentious Supreme Court decision over the Florida recount. The Washington Post had said that “John Lewis, for instance, spent the day in his Atlanta district. He thought it would be hypocritical to attend Bush’s swearing-in because he doesn’t believe Bush is the true elected president.” Lewis had courted controversy when during last Friday “Meet the Press” interview he said he does not consider Trump to be a “legitimate president”. Trump’s volley of tweets followed on Saturday morning and continued into that evening. But Trump’s feud with Lewis at a time when the US is commemorating the legacy of Martin Luther King Jr. led to the increase of Democratic lawmakers from the initial small group who had planned to boycott the inauguration to over 50, many of whom cited Trump’s tweets about Lewis as their reason. Perhaps, in a bid to ease tensions, Trump met with Martin Luther King III in New York on Monday to discuss voting rights. Yet, his ill-advised brawl with Lewis – a man who was clubbed by the police and hospitalised during the 1965’s historic civil rights march from Selma to Montgomery – could potentially further hurt his relations with the African-American community and even pitch the Democrats against the Republicans. It is ironic that Lewis’s charge of illegitimacy should be a source of irritation for Trump. Did he not spend years trying to prove the same about his predecessor’s presidency? Besides, Trump’s quirky habit of tweeting his response at a slightest provocation remains a cause for concern among those who think his tweets could unleash unsavoury global consequences. Lewis based his decision not to attend Trump’s inauguration on the alleged Russian interference in the November election. Hence, the civil rights icon’s allusion to Trump’s illegitimacy. But even with the controversy swirling around him, Americans have one good reason to look forward to his presidency: job-creation. The real estate developer’s last November’s win at the presidential polls seemed to have spurred many companies to announce the creation of new factories or jobs in the US. Among them are the air conditioning manufacturer, Carrier, Japan’s SoftBank, Ford, Fiat Chrysler and Amazon, which famously promised to create 100,000 jobs. Also, there were cheery announcements by Wal-Mart and General Motors. While the former announced on Tuesday that it would invest $6.8 billion in the US and create 10,000 jobs, the latter offered $1 billion in new US investments and pledged to create 5,000 new jobs. For this, Trump took the credit in his Tuesday tweet. “With all of the jobs I am bringing back into the US (even before taking office), with all of the new auto plants coming back into our country and with the massive cost reductions I have negotiated on military purchases and more, I believe the people are seeing ‘big stuff,’” he claimed. Trump last month also denounced the $4 billion price tag on the next presidential plane, which is currently being developed, with a threat to cancel the order unless the price came down. This led to the visit of the aviation giant Boeing’s CEO Dennis Muilenburg to Trump Tower in Manhattan on Tuesday. Muilenburg would tell reporters afterwards that he and Trump were “on the same page” about the cost and value of the jet. On the foreign scene, while his foreign policy proposals had appeared vague and contradictory during his campaign, Russia and Israel had openly rooted for his presidency. Meanwhile, his NATO allies were discomfited by his recent remarks to the effect that the alliance is obsolete. He came short of berating Germany for its open-door policy on refugees. Meanwhile, preparations for his inauguration had entered the final stages since Sunday when organisers carried out a rehearsal of the ceremony and parade, with a military officer who is the same height as Trump standing in for the president-elect. Washington DC’s central axis, running from the White House to the Capitol, where Trump will be sworn in, has been cordoned off. The task of ensuring safety at the event has been entrusted to about 28,000 security forces, some of whom are already on duty in the streets of Washington. Perhaps, a major security challenge is the planned protest march by hundreds of thousands of protesters on Friday and Saturday.

[Illustrations: v_alex/iStock] Recent posts Mexican Designers Have Some Polite Suggestions For Trump A New Competition Tackles Climate Change In The Bay Area (Since The White House Won't) How A Smart University Design Can Help Revitalize A City More Places To Buy Booze Means More Violent Neighborhoods (In Every Part Of Town) Douglas Rushkoff 01.19.17 10:00 AM The folks at Davos this week are trying to behave as if everything is normal. Sure, England is Brexiting from Europe and the United States appears to be retreating from the global stage altogether. But somehow the word from Switzerland is that a mix of the right interest rates, investment strategies, and business optimism will keep free trade and globalization on course and safe from this boorish surge of populism. The potential for widespread, bottom-up prosperity unleashed by digital technology have been surrendered to the priorities of extractive global capitalism. They’re missing the point. The rise of nationalist sentiments are not the cause of the economic shift underway, but a result of it. The real force energizing these changes is digital. While the digital economy has accelerated and amplified many of the mechanisms investors and corporations use to grow their capital, it has left most people with less money and less opportunity. This latest burst of fear stemming from that lack of opportunity is coming in the form of nationalism, and even protectionism, but it also could offer us a fleeting but real chance to turn our digital economy toward the needs of people instead of finance itself. Don’t get me wrong. I’m all for prosperous businesses, digital and otherwise. But I’ve also witnessed with horror over the past 20 years as the potential for widespread, bottom-up prosperity unleashed by digital technology have been surrendered to the priorities of extractive global capitalism. This is not the way it was supposed to go, at least not according to me and my cyberpunk friends of the late '80s. Back then, the emergence of low-cost computers and networking appeared to augur a peer-to-peer, fluid, and more open economic landscape, one where we all step off the industrial-age, punch-the-clock treadmill and work in our own time, collaboratively, on creative pursuits, from home, in our underwear. Instead, we’re getting an exacerbation of some of extractive corporatism’s worst effects: joblessness, disenfranchisement, wealth disparity, corporate lethargy, artificial growth, and financialization. Why aren’t we getting new, digitally enabled forms of community currency, worker-owned businesses, networked cooperatives, and peer-to-peer marketplaces? It turns out it is not because they don’t work; it’s simply because there are entrenched powers and limited visions preventing their rise. They find it hard to see digital technology as anything other than an investment opportunity. A company is not a provider of goods or services, but a "disruptor" capable of overturning an existing marketplace and generating 100x returns to the early shareholders. It doesn’t matter what the company does, if anything, after that. Silicon Valley may trumpet its innovation bona fides, but this is a very old way of doing business, which digital technology should have rendered obsolete. So young developers in their dorm rooms may come up with a great idea for a revenue-generating and largely beneficial application. But then, almost automatically, they rush to find angel investors or venture capitalists to back their ideas. Along with the infusion of capital come unrealistically high valuations and unrefusable demands to "pivot" away from whatever the company may have once sought to accomplish. Instead, the company must focus on how to hit a 100x "home run," usually by disrupting an existing marketplace and establishing the sort of temporary monopoly that convinces a new round of investors to buy the shares of the last ones. Silicon Valley may trumpet its innovation bona fides, but this is a very old way of doing business, which digital technology should have rendered obsolete instead of amplifying. But most business leaders, bankers, and even economists tend to accept venture capitalism as a pre-existing condition of nature. It is not. The rules of capitalism were invented by human beings, at particular moments in history, with particular goals and agendas. It's like a computer program, with accumulated lines of code written by developers throughout history with specific functions in mind. By refusing to acknowledge this, we end up incapable of getting beneath the surface. We end up transacting, and living, at the mercy of a system—of a medium, really. In fact, there are precedents to the digitally distributed economy so many of still imagine. And they are often characterized by a retreat from international ambitions and restored focus on the power of local, circulatory economics. The last example of this happening on a grand scale was back in the late Middle Ages, just after the expansionism of the Crusades. As European soldiers returned home, they brought with them many innovations from the Arab world. One of them was the bazaar, or what became known as the market. It was a local economic innovation that turned market activity into a bottom-up, generative, and local affair. Former peasants began to trade the goods they made with one another, instead of simply paying up to the lords. They also imported the idea for market moneys that were good just for one day—like poker chips, except representing a loaf of bread or pound of grain—and optimized for priming transactions. And they began to get wealthy. Threatened by the rise of a middle class, the aristocracy and monarchs "innovated" against the former peasants. They made market moneys illegal, and forced merchants to borrow from the central treasury, at interest. That allowed the wealthy to make money simply by controlling currency, while also setting in motion the growth trap we’re caught in today. The monarchs also restricted entrance to particular industries by issuing "monopoly charters" to their favorite businesses, in return for a stake in the profits. So, as I’ve tried to show in my book Throwing Rocks at the Google Bus, from which the chart above is taken, the hands-on economy of the artisanal market was overtaken by the more extractive rules of early industrialism. Workers were disconnected from the value they created and paid by the hour instead. In this light, industrialism and mechanization were just ways to remove human beings from the value chain. By Rushkoff's book, Throwing Rocks at the Google Bus, here That’s the economy we’ve been living in for the past 600-or-so years. The growth mandate was great for colonial powers looking to expand into new territories. As long as there were new people to enslave and resources to extract, capital could grow. But by the end of World War II, those people and places started to push back. Could we finally give up the global expansionist agenda of late medieval capitalism, and revisit an economic model that didn’t require the sort of growth that was proving impossible to maintain? Now, digital technology should have been able to retrieve the values of pre-industrialism, and realize them in new ways. The human-to-human contact of the local marketplace is retrieved by the personalization of our digital networks. Market currencies can be retrieved by blockchains or even simpler authentication methods. Web-enabled cottage industries should thrive with their newfound equal footing and distributive power. Meanwhile, the commons and crowdfunding—enclosed and regulated out of existence during the corporate industrial era—find new life in an age whose foundational technologies are based in sharing processing cycles. Uber can’t see that having wealthy customers and employees is actually good for the long-term health of their businesses because they’re trapped in an early colonial mindset. But by the early 90s, the cyberpunks’ human-centered vision of a networked marketplace was replaced by another vision of digital business, the one espoused by the libertarian early editors of Wired magazine and the corporate-sponsored futurists of Cambridge, Massachusetts. They looked at digital technology and saw the salvation of the securities markets and the infinitely expanding global economy. The stock market had crashed in 1987, along with the bursting of the biotech bubble. But now digital technology was to restore the NASDAQ to its former glory, and beyond. Indeed, just when it looked like we had reached the limits of the physical world to supply us with more opportunities for growth, it seemed we had discovered a virtual world from which to extract still more value. This new digital economy would augur a "long boom" of economic growth: a digitally amplified, speculative economy that could literally expand forever. To do that, however, technologies with the potential to distribute value throughout their marketplaces and generate long-term sustainable revenue streams are instead converted into powerfully extractive versions of themselves. Amazon, for one ready example, could have developed itself into a value-creating marketplace like eBay. Instead, it adopted a scorched earth approach to its markets. Amazon chose the book industry as its initial beachhead not because of Jeff Bezos love of reading, but because it was a no-growth, highly inefficient market, ripe for domination. Amazon’s purpose is not to make authors and publishers wealthier, but to use its capital to undercut existing players, establish a monopoly, and then used that monopoly to "pivot" into other "verticals." It’s the same extractive model utilized by 20th-century behemoths like Walmart, except the total domination of a market occurs even more quickly. Uber, likewise, could have developed a thriving taxi marketplace by letting local companies and drivers maintain their autonomy on the platform or, alternatively, allowing drivers to earn shares proportionate to the miles they’ve driven. At least that way, once robots replace the human drivers, they would still get some revenue from the platform they helped build with their labor. But that’s not Uber’s goal. The company is still on the chartered monopolist’s script. Only in this case, instead of using the King’s law to maintain their status, they use code. They can’t see that having wealthy customers and employees is actually good for the long-term health of their businesses because they’re trapped in an early colonial mindset that sees markets as territories to conquer, resources to extract, and people to enslave. Reinforcing all this is a shareholder mentality obsessed with growth and a tax code that favors capital gains over real earnings. No wonder companies focus on stock price, IPOs, and acquisition over real, taxable revenues. Most digital companies’ shares are their only true product. So instead of moving to the last column of the chart—digital distributism—we have ended up stuck in the third: a digitally amplified version of the same old global industrialism. Digital industrialism is characterized more by the destruction of value and its conversion into share price than the creation of value and its distribution to the stakeholders who made it possible. Digital industrialism exacerbates the imbalance between the traditional factors of production - land, labor, and capital, giving voice only to the needs of the venture capitalists and their mindless pursuit of growth. Instead of earning 10 dollars once, businesses must figure out how to earn the same dollar 10 times. But it’s working too well for its own good. These corporations are great at extracting capital from the markets they enter but really bad at deploying it. Corporate profit over size has been declining steadily for decades, now. They grow obese and lose the ability to innovate. So, Google becomes Alphabet, a "holding company" that buys and sells technology companies because it can no longer innovate, itself. Facebook’s biggest moves are not technology developments but acquisitions. Digital industrialism turns its biggest players into vacuum cleaners that suck out the value, and maybe park it in share price or, worse, overseas—but don’t know how to distribute it or even put it to work. That’s because they’re trapped trying to run 21st-century digital businesses on a 13th-century printing-press-era operating system. The real problem with the digital economy as it is currently constituted is not the digital, but the economics. The nationalism and protectionism of today’s anti-globalists may be based in jingoism and xenophobia, but it could also—at least temporarily—create the boundary conditions necessary for something more like local, circulatory economic activity to take root. Such boundaries, like closing borders or enacting harsh import tariffs, don’t just prevent the leak of jobs overseas. They discourage businesses from thinking of their markets as global, much less infinite. The markets in which they operate are decidedly finite. This forces them to stop thinking of themselves as simply sucking up all the cash in a particular territory and then moving on to the next. They must develop local economies that are capable of renewing themselves and delivering ongoing revenue. Instead of earning 10 dollars once, businesses must figure out how to earn the same dollar 10 times. That means promoting not the extraction of capital from a market, but the velocity of money through a market. What goes around comes around. With any luck, businesses will take a cue from those who already operate this way, such as the US Steelworkers Union. Faced with the declining stock market of 2007, the steelworkers were looking for alternative investments for their pension fund. Instead of outsourcing their funds to S&P index funds, they got the fantastically circular idea to invest in construction projects that hired steelworkers. They invested in a project that not only earned them equity but paid them back their investment as wages. Such strategies are actually more consonant with digital networks, which circulate information in a distributed fashion and share resources more easily than they hoard them. They are not infinitely expanding; they are bounded and self-sustaining. But they are really difficult to execute in an economic environment characterized by rapid growth startups and infinitely scaling corporate growth. The real world doesn’t scale. An economy doesn’t require global scale or growth to function; it simply needs people with skills, people with needs, and a means of exchange. A momentary withdrawal from that game forced by anti-globalist protectionist policies may actually allow for some digital distributism to gain traction. It will force us to remember that an economy doesn’t require global scale or growth to function; it simply needs people with skills, people with needs, and a means of exchange. The finance ministers and corporate chiefs attending Davos—as well as the decisions they make—are inconsequential to this activity. Their effort to salvage the global economy is really just an effort to keep us back in the third column of the chart, the digital industrialism that extracts value from people by evermore technologically creative means. In contrast, a genuinely distributed economy requires those on the ground to develop strategies for economic and social viability from the bottom up. Don’t be surprised to see labor cooperatives, commons-based approaches to resource management, and even local currencies emerge to fill in where federal action falls short. While these mechanisms may not have worked convincingly before, digital technologies may just lend us the decentralized methods of accounting and authentication we lacked in the Middle Ages. Whether we like it or not, it’s again time to return from the Crusades, and try a second time to build a new economy here at home.

The dictionary defines entitlement as an expectation of privileges and special treatment. Judging by contemporary events, there’s a lot of it around. Let’s set the Senate aside. We know the answer there. That is what happens when you confer unaccountable power on an unelected elite, essentially for life. But the expectation of special treatment is more difficult to explain among elected officials. Indeed, it defies our entire notion of government, which is founded on a commitment to public service, not personal privilege. Yet still it goes on. Two recent examples: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is being investigated by the federal ethics commissioner for a holiday he and his family took over the Christmas period. It appears Trudeau, along with his wife and children, stayed as guests at a private island in the Bahamas. The island is owned by the Aga Khan, a billionaire spiritual leader. Trudeau was joined on the junket by a Liberal MP and his spouse, and the Liberal party president and her husband. In addition to accepting free hospitality, the group travelled to the island in a private helicopter. The Aga Khan’s foundation has received $300 million in federal grants. When leading figures in our governing party accept such gifts, there is at least the appearance of a quid pro quo. Trudeau, however, insists he isn’t concerned, and in one sense it’s easy to see why. The worst punishment he faces is a snippy letter from the commissioner. This is how our House of Commons treats three of the deadly sins — greed, gluttony and pride: with a slap on the wrist. The remaining four aren’t even subject to discipline, and the reason is obvious. Try investigating federal politicians on charges of lust, sloth, wrath or envy, and you would empty both houses of Parliament. Then we have Brian Pallister, the newly elected premier of Manitoba. This tribune of the people is no sooner in office than he announces he intends to take up to two months vacation in Costa Rica each year. His explanation? “I don’t mean to sound like I’m petulant … but I do work a lot of nights. I do work a lot of weekends and so I don’t see my children.” I’ll bet that goes over well with low-income parents who also work late, who don’t cart home an annual salary of $160,000 plus expenses and who can’t take time off when it suits them. Can you imagine an employee at Walmart going to her boss and asking for eight weeks of vacation because she’s not seeing enough of her children? Faced with this mind-boggling sense of entitlement, it’s no good asking if our elected leaders have no shame. We already know the answer: No. But Winnipeg is a city long in decline. The province has some of the worst poverty rates in the country. How could Pallister look voters in the eye and lay this hogwash on them? Answer: Because he evidently thinks he deserves special treatment. And this is the real source of entitlement behaviour — the illusion of status. Or in simple language, thinking too much of yourself. I’m sure it never occurred to Trudeau or Pallister that anyone would find fault with their behaviour. They thought they were just taking what was owed on account of the positions they hold. Yet neither of these men has spent even half a term in office and already the rot has set in. The solution, of course, lies with us. If voters stand for such displays of arrogance, we have no one to blame but ourselves. Time, I think, to make our displeasure known. jalmcfarlane@shaw.ca © Copyright Times Colonist Email to a Friend Your Email Address: * Your Name: * To Email Address: * Message: * * Please separate multiple email addresses with the semi-colon character.

I can buy almost any consumer product I want just by clicking on my phone or computer — or even easier, by just saying: “Alexa: buy me one” — and it will be shipped to my door within days or even hours for free. I can buy books for my Kindle, or music for my phone instantly. I can watch movies or TV shows on demand. But for retail workers, Amazon is a grave threat. Just ask the 10,100 workers who are losing their jobs at Macy’s (M) or the 4,000 at The Limited. Or the thousands of workers at Sears (SHLD) and Kmart, which just announced 150 stores will be closing. Or the 125,000 retail workers who’ve been laid off over the past two years.© Provided by Dow Jones & Company, Inc. Online sales are growing much faster than sales at stores found in malls and shopping centers. Amazon and other online sellers have decimated some sectors of the retail industry in the past few years. For instance, employment at department stores has plunged by 250,000 (or 14%) since 2012. Employment at clothing and electronics stores is down sharply from the earlier peaks as more sales move online. “Consumers’ affinity for digital shopping felt like it hit a tipping point in Holiday 2014 and has rapidly accelerated this year,” Ken Perkins, the president of Retail Metrics, wrote in a research note in December. And when he says “digital shopping,” he really means Amazon, which has increased its share of online purchases from about 10% five years ago to nearly 40% in the 2016 holiday season. It’s only going to go higher, as Amazon aggressively targets other sectors such as groceries and even restaurants with delivery services for restaurant-prepared meals. (For more background, read “Amazon’s Stranglehold: How the Company’s Tightening Grip Is Stifling Competition, Eroding Jobs, and Threatening Communities”) At the end of 2016, the retail sector employed 16.5 million workers, and the restaurant industry employed another 11.4 million. Together, that’s nearly one out of every five workers in America, the same share of employment accounted for by the manufacturing sector in 1982. Many of those jobs are threatened by Amazon’s incredible growth. But some are relatively safe: Most of the 11.4 million restaurant jobs are safe from online competition, for instance, because people still love going out to eat, and someone has to cook and wash the dishes. The 1.3 million working at car dealerships probably won’t be affected anytime soon, and neither will the 925,000 at gas stations, or the 1.1 million working at building materials stores. You won’t buy a new car, or a gallon of gas, or 50 sheets of drywall online. However, about 12 million jobs in retail are facing increasing competition from Amazon, particularly the 6.2 million people who work in the kind of stores that are typically found at malls or shopping centers — furniture, appliance and electronics, clothing, sporting goods, bookstores, and general merchandise stores — what the statisticians call GAFO (General Merchandise, Apparel and Accessories, Furniture and Other Sales). GAFO is the heart of what we think of as retail, and that’s where Amazon has revolutionized the market. After years of barely holding their own, sales at GAFO stores have stalled, falling $1.8 billion (or 0.6%) in the past year while the rest of retail was growing 4%. Meanwhile, online sales jumped by $13.7 billion through the third quarter of 2016, with Amazon accounting for most of that. It is expected to overtake Macy’s as the country’s top retailer of apparel this year. At current growth rates, Amazon would have annual revenue of $500 billion in five years. As traditional retailers close stores and dismiss workers, shopping at the mall will make less and less sense. There’s not much retailers like Macy’s, The Gap (GPS) , Best Buy (BBY) and Barnes & Noble (BKS)  can do about it. Their business will be much, much smaller. And now that Amazon is getting serious about groceries, even Wal-Mart (WMT) is threatened. Although retailers have been laying off workers, they probably aren’t laying off enough, considering how quickly their sales are eroding. While sales fell 0.6% in 2016, employment at the GAFO stores increased by 1.6%, or about 95,000. You don’t make money by hiring more people to sell less. So what’s the big deal? Won’t the people who once worked at Macy’s just work at Amazon instead? Well, no. Amazon needs about half as many workers to sell $100 worth of merchandise as Macy’s does. Macy’s has floor walkers, and saleswomen at the makeup counter to give personal attention, and cashiers, if you can find one. By contrast, Amazon has “pickers” in warehouses who grab hundreds of items off the shelves every hour. Amazon just announced it would hire a lot more pickers this year as it opens more distribution centers. But even those jobs are threatened by Amazon. That’s because Amazon is at the forefront of automating retail. More and more of the work in the warehouses will be done by robots, and Amazon contemplates deploying flying drones (robots) to deliver the packages to your door. Amazon’s concept for selling groceries includes almost no workers, because customers will check themselves out and robots will restock the shelves. What’s most troubling to brick-and-mortar retailers and their workers is that Amazon’s sales growth is accelerating (19% in 2014, 20% in 2015 and 28% in 2016), and shows no sign of plateauing. Amazon isn’t just taking sales from brick-and-mortar stores; it’s also taking market share from traditional retailers’ online stores. Amazon is also moving aggressively into warehousing and package delivery services, which combined employ 2 million workers, including 600,000 at the post office. How many of those jobs will Amazon’s drones take? Could Amazon actually kill more American jobs than China did? It’s quite likely. Economists David Autor, David Dorn and Gordon Hanson have estimated China’s manufacturing exports to the U.S. may have cost as many as 2 million jobs. If Amazon can capture 40% of the GAFO market within five years (as seems likely), about 1.5 million jobs at brick-and-mortar stores could be lost. Add in the jobs Amazon will kill at grocery stores, drugstores, warehouses and delivery services, and the total would be well over 2 million. And unlike the manufacturing jobs lost to China, which were clustered in a comparatively few counties, those retail jobs are located in every city, town and hamlet in America. Don’t worry, though. Economic theory says the displaced workers will find other jobs as the economy grows more productive. And Amazon will pay you a couple of bucks if you’ll use your own car to deliver packages to your neighbors.

X Galway man sells hair revival brand Viviscal for €150m James Murphy’s celebrity-endorsed brand bought by Church & Dwight Fri, Jan 20, 2017, 04:00 Updated: Fri, Jan 20, 2017, 08:10 Mark Paul Actor Jennifer Aniston is among the celebrities who have endorsed Viviscal. Photograph: Frazer Harrison/Getty Images         Galway-based entrepreneur James Murphy has sold his Viviscal hair restoration brand to the owner of Arm & Hammer toothpaste for a price understood to be in the region of €150 million. Mr Murphy is the founder of beauty products group Lifes2Good, out of which Viviscal was carved in a restructuring last year. The buyer, the $11.5 billion (€10.8 billion) listed US giant Church & Dwight, is preparing to announce the deal next month. It is understood Church & Dwight is buying the subsidiary Viviscal Ltd, which owns the celebrity endorsed hair restoration brand that is sold in more than 25,000 stores across the United States. This entity is 90 per cent owned by Mr Murphy, according to company records, with the remaining 10 per cent owned by the holding company of Lifes2Good. The holding company is backed by investors including BDO Development Capital Fund, which pumped €5 million into the business in 2015. Mr Murphy retained majority control of the group. Laya Healthcare sees profits soar as revenues jump by nearly 16% Ex-UDG boss tapped by New York private equity firm Dublin hospital group records €7.8m deficit as staff costs rise Disposal After the disposal of Viviscal, Lifes2Good will continue under its current ownership selling its remaining brands, which include Sonic Chic toothbrushes and Pettura pet products. It is understood Mr Murphy’s company was advised on the deal by speciality beauty industry investment bank, Michel Dyens, based in New York and Paris. Mr Murphy was unavailable for comment Thursday night. Rick Dierker, the chief financial officer of Church & Dwight, said the company has no plans to comment “at this time”. He said the group releases its earnings report on February 7th and “would mention any transaction at that time along with details”. The deal marks a stunning success for Mr Murphy, a member of the Galway Tenors singing group who founded Lifes2Good 20 years ago. Viviscal has grown fast in the US market in recent years, and has been endorsed by celebrities including Jennifer Aniston, Gwyneth Paltrow, Cate Blanchett, Reese Witherspoon and Miley Cyrus. ADVERTISEMENT Endorsed by celebrities The product promotes hair growth using a compound called AminoMar, and is available for men and women. The male version of the product is endorsed by celebrities including Rob Kardashian and former rugby player Kyran Bracken. As well as its sales in Europe, Viviscal is available across the US in major chains such as CVS, Walgreens and Wal-Mart. The overall Lifes2Good group reported sales last year of €50 million, with operating profits of about €3 million. Viviscal Ltd acquired the intellectual property for the brand in a restructuring a year ago, in a €13 million deal. Church & Dwight owns a wide range of brands, including Arm & Hammer, which accounts for the bulk of its sales via its branded toothpaste, household detergents and deodorants. It also owns Trojan condoms and Orajel toothpaste.       Topics: Cate Blanchett Cyrus Miley Gwyneth Paltrow James Murphy Jennifer Aniston Michel Dyens Rick Dierker Rob Kardashian BDO Chruch & Whie Church Cvs Lifes2good Viviscal WalMart Walgreen Read More Randox, a long-time healthcare supplier, now markets to consumers Amryt shares jump on deal to sell cholesterol disorder drug ‘Challenging trading environment’ sees profits fall at Galway Clinic Healthcare firm Maryland to create 140 jobs in Belfast World’s biggest tobacco company may stop selling cigarettes Nualtra fails to force UK rival into court cross-examination UDG eyes Northern pharmacies stake sale amid overseas drive Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Transport & Tourism Goldman Sachs and AIB team up for Glen of Downs Golf Club sale Work Getting criticism to deliver at work Golf Tiger Woods’ comeback ends in a missed cut at Torrey Pines Health Cervical cancer virus traces found in 15% of women screened Sponsored Retiring with financial security to the serenity of the Wicklow hills Opel OnStar puts personal assistance in the driving seat Plan your financial future and enjoy your dream retirement Leading the dance: 'Growing up competing I learned the drive to keep going' ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Latest Business To stem tourist tsunami, Barcelona bans new hotels in city centre 02:15 Goldman Sachs and AIB team up for Glen of Downs Golf Club sale 02:00 Travel Advice: Specialist travel agents will help you get best first-class and business-class fares 01:00 Australian firms looking to Ireland as EU base, says IDA 21:08 US: weak growth boosts Trump’s tough trade stance 20:42 ADVERTISEMENT Most Read in Business 1 Goldman Sachs and AIB team up for Glen of Downs Golf Club sale 2 Messy divorce beckons at Mercantile pub group 3 To stem tourist tsunami, Barcelona bans new hotels in city centre 4 Glanbia to open major new production plant in Michigan 5 Australian firms looking to Ireland as EU base, says IDA 6 Oil prices continue to rise as Opec reductions take effect 7 US: weak growth boosts Trump’s tough trade stance 8 In a future brave new world will it be possible to live forever? 9 'Leprechaun economics' set to change EU GDP calculations 10 Why Ryanair is offering package holidays now Never miss a story.

(AP Photo/Chester County District Attorney's Office) By Michael Rellahan, Daily Local News Posted: 01/19/17, 5:18 PM EST | Updated: 6 days ago # Comments WEST CHESTER >> The death penalty trial for the man accused of the brutal torture and murder of 3-year-old Scott “Scotty” McMillan was pushed back until September after a convoluted hearing Thursday on whether the accused is competent to help his attorney defend the case. After a hour-long proceeding that dealt with a motion to have Gary Lee Fellenbaum undergo a psychological evaluation — first made and then withdrawn by his defense attorney — Common Pleas Judge William Mahon ordered that the new trial date be set for Sept. 18, more than five months after its previously scheduled start date of April 1. In the meantime, Mahon gave Fellenbaum’s attorney, George Yacoubian of Philadelphia, 45 days to have his client evaluated by a mental health expert to determine whether he would be competent to stand trial. The judge also set a date in mid-April for hearings on a number of pre-trial motions, including whether to combine Fellenbaum’s trial with that of the victim’s mother, Jillian Tait, and whether to move the trial out of Chester County. Those motions were initially set to be heard by Mahon starting Thursday, but were set aside after Yacoubian raised the issue of whether he believed Fellenbaum would be intellectually able to assist him during the capital murder trial, or whether some mental infirmity would prevent him from doing so. Advertisement McMillan’s lifeless body was found in November 2014 in the trailer in West Caln that he lived in his mother, his older brother, Fellenbaum, and Fellenbaum’s estranged wife. Fellenbaum and Tait had begun dating several weeks earlier and had been living together in the home, during which Fellenbaum allegedly beat McMillan severely and, allegedly with Tait’s help, tortured the 3-year-old and his brother. District Attorney Tom Hogan, in announcing the arrests or Fellenbaum and Tait, called McMillan’s death, “an American horror story.” Earlier this month, said Yacoubian during a drawn out explanation before Mahon of his changing views on the matter, he had developed concerns about Fellenbaum’s competency. Although he did not lay out specifics of what led him to have concerns, they stemmed from a letter Fellenbaum wrote Mahon on Jan. 10 in which he said he wanted to represent himself. Yacoubian, said however, that after discussing the matter with Fellenbaum’s father — who appeared in the courtroom Thursday — and again with Fellenbaum himself in the Justice Center lockup that morning, he had decided that Fellenbaum’s competency was not an issue. “It is clear to me that he is competent to proceed with whatever the next step (in the trial) might be,” Yacoubian told Mahon. “I believe firmly that he does understand what these proceedings are, what his role is, and what the role of the prosecution and the court are. I believe that he can adequately assist me in his defense.” He said he believed that the questions he had with Fellenbaum arose from bad legal advice that Fellenbaum was getting from other inmates at Chester County Prison, where he is being held without bail. The “unusual conversation” he had with Fellenbaum earlier this month at the prison about his wish to represent himself was in fact swayed by others who “are leading him down the path of bad advice,” Yacoubian said. “I believe it is an issue of undue influence and not any underlying mental health issue.” Questions about Fellenbaum’s competency, “are not what I believe now,” the attorney said. Yacoubian asked to formally withdraw motion he had filed earlier Thursday morning asking to be allowed to have Fellenbaum’s competency evaluated. But both Mahon and First Assistant Michael Noone, who is leading the prosecution, said they were not comfortable with having the competency issue done away with so easily. Noone said that should Yacoubian abandon a formal evaluation of his client, the matter could be raised on appeal should Fellenbaum be convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death. He said the “integrity” of any conviction could be challenged in the future should the competency issue be raised and then dismissed without a true finding. “Once competency is raised, the proverbial genie is out of the bottle and needs to be addressed,” Noone said. Mahon, seemingly frustrated by Yacoubian’s changing stance, said that the attorney had first raised the issue of competency with him in a Jan. 11 letter, and then more formally in the pre-trial motion filed Thursday. Noting that Yacoubian had not training or expertise in judging whether a person was psychologically incompetent or not, he said. Out of an “abundance of concern,” Mahon said he would dismiss Yacoubian’s request to withdrawn his motion on competency, and asked him what course he would take. After consulting with Fellenbaum’s father, Yacoubian said he would be willing to hire an independent psychologist to evaluate him. Mahon said he would give the defense until March to prepare a report, which would then give the prosecution an opportunity to prepare its own report. Those matters would then be litigated at the next hearing in April — at which time Mahon said he also intends to question Fellenbaum about his request to represent himself. Fellenbaum, dressed in a black t-shirt and black pants, did not speak during the hearing. He was brought in and out of the courtroom in handcuffs and shackles, and returned to the prison. The hearing on Tait’s pre-trial motions was also continued because she intends to oppose Fellenbaum’s request for a joint trial, and will have to wait until the issue of his competency is settled. Fellenbaum, 25, Tait, 33, and Amber Fellenbaum, 25, all worked at the Walmart in western Chester County in the summer and early fall of 2014. Tait moved in with the Fellenbaums at a trailer home on Hope Lane sometime in September, 2014. Beginning in October 2014, according to the allegations set forth in the case against the Fellenbaums and Tait, Gary Fellenbaum began physically abusing both of Tait’s sons. The abuse included punches and beatings, but also whipping with a crudely fashioned “cat o’nine tails,” and tying the boys to chairs or hanging them upside down by their feet. Allegedly Fellenbaum’s beating of Scott McMillan escalated to the point where the boy could not hold down his food. Angered, Fellenbaum allegedly punched him in the face so hard he fell out of his chair, and later punched him in the stomach. The boy began vomiting and later passed out. Although Fellenbaum and Tait tried to revive him, they left him alone in a bedroom for several hours before finding him completely unresponsive in the evening of Nov. 4, 2014. Both allegedly gave incriminating statements to police investigators after their arrests. Yacoubian and Harmelin have asked Mahon, in their motions, to suppress those statements, saying they were given under duress. Amber Fellenbaum, who did not participate in the alleged abuse, called 911. She is not charged with murder, but rather with endangering the welfare of children and recklessly endangering another person. The trial is expected to last three weeks. Mahon said he would summon as many as 250 potential jurors to the courthouse to insure a fair panel could be seated. To contact staff writer Michael P. Rellahan call 610-696-1544.
