DJIA S&P 500 NASDAQ Markets Today Here's Why You'll Lose Money in Walmart Be cautious right now. Chris Laudani Jan 9, 2017 9:12 AM EST Walmart (WMT) shares are gathering dust in the bargain bin. The stock has underperformed the S&P 500 since mid-2013. Basically the stock is back to where it was before the October analyst meeting. On Nov. 17, Walmart reported third-quarter fiscal 2017 earnings of 98 cents per share, 2 cents better than expected. About 2 cents came from company's share repurchase program, in which te company spent $1.4 billion to buy back shares. Walmart has spent $6.2 billion on buybacks in the last year. Revenue rose 0.5% to $117.18 billion vs. the $117.86 billion consensus estimate. U.S same-store sales rose 1.2%, driven by a 0.7% increase in store traffic. The average ticket rose 0.5%, or 70 basis points. Inventory declined 2% and same-store inventory declined approximately 6% while in-stock levels improved. E-commerce sales jumped 20.6% and contributed 50 basis points of the comp store figure. This quarter confirmed the problem I had with Walmart after the October analyst meeting. Then, I thought Walmart was going to spend a lot of money to fix its business. And basically, that's what happened. Operating income of $5.11 billion fell 10.4%. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales jumped 21.8%, or 103 basis points. Gross margin increased 32 basis points, less than expected. Expenses rose 8.6% as a result of the associate wage increase as well as investments in technology to support the company's ongoing e-commerce efforts. Because of the higher expenses, Walmart has no earnings leverage. The company is scheduled to report fourth-quarter and year-end results on Feb. 21. Analysts are expecting earnings of $1.29 (vs. $1.49 last year) on $130.5 billion in revenue.

Report: Walmart To Lay Off Hundreds Of Employees By End Of The Month Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Report: Walmart To Lay Off Hundreds Of Employees By End Of The Month Image courtesy of (Mike Mozart) January 10, 2017 4:49 pm EST By Ashlee Kieler@akieler hit the road walmart lay off lay offs Hundreds of employees at Walmart will soon be out a job, as the big box retailer is reportedly set to eliminate a number of positions around the country before the end of its fiscal year on Jan. 31. The Wall Street Journal, citing sources familiar with the matter, reports that the layoffs will likely take place at the retailer’s headquarters and in certain regional stores. The bulk of the cuts are reportedly focused on the company’s human resources division. Executives believe the positions could be more streamlined, with duties being taken over by outside consultants or other employees, the WSJ reports. The unspecified number of cuts will account for a small percentage of the company’s staff in Bentonville, the sources say. A spokesperson for Walmart tells Consumerist that the company has not made any announcements related to its 1.5 million associates at the corporate and store level. “As we’ve previously shared, we are always looking for ways to operate more efficiently and effectively,” Randy Hargrove, senior director of corporate communications tells Consumerist. “While we continually look at our corporate structure, we have not made any announcements.  Like any organization, we make decisions based upon what’s best for our business and the customers we serve.” While Walmart hasn’t confirmed the cuts as reported by the WSJ, the potential for them isn’t entirely surprising,  as the company’s CEO Doug McMillon said in October that the company was working to “manage expenses better, which includes changing how we do work inside the company.” “We must grow this company for Walmart to have a future, but we need to do it in an efficient way,” he said at the Annual Meeting with the Investment Community. “It’s not a growth at all cost mindset.” The impending layoffs are just the latest for the big box retailer. The WSJ reports that the company laid off hundreds of workers at its headquarters in 2015, and cut about 7,000 back-of-the-office jobs in its stores in favor of automating some divisions. Those cuts don’t count the employees who were let go when Walmart closed 154 stores around the country in Jan. 2016. While the stores only represented less than 1% of Walmart’s total retail footprint, some 10,000 workers were out of a job.

Now it thinks it can teach old-school retailers a thing or two about real-world commerce. The online juggernaut that vanquished eBay and Amazon in China has set its sights on transforming the byzantine world of brick-and-mortar retail. In its biggest old-economy deal so far, Alibaba is leading a bid to buy out department store chain Intime Retail Group Co. for as much as USD2.6 billion. That’s a premium for the privilege of owning a company with shrinking revenues and a minuscule footprint beyond its eastern home region. But by teaming up with retailers, billionaire founder Jack Ma hopes to develop a new model of online and offline retail. The idea is that Alibaba’s superior computing power, a decade of experience moving billions of dollars of goods and strong ties with government and big brands will help it succeed where others like Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and even Amazon.com Inc. have failed. If it works, the tie-up may open the door to still more, helping Alibaba both extend its logistics network and gain invaluable consumer data. “No one has any solution or concrete answer, although everyone knows that this is the next page of the industry. Alibaba wants to be the one to develop the solution,” said Anson Chan, a Hong-Kong based Daiwa Capital Markets analyst. History has shown that online and offline businesses don’t play well together. Wal- Mart spent billions of dollars on growing its e-commerce operation at the expense of profits, yet Amazon still holds sway in the U.S. Amazon itself is now venturing into brick-and-mortar stores though that effort is still nascent. Alibaba however is dealing with a very different market, and is driven by a need to secure new sources of growth as e-commerce plateaus. Ma himself has confessed he sees “tremendous challenges” for one-dimensional e-commerce operators as the country’s economy slows. His goal is to try and up-end a splintered and bloated $4.5 trillion Chinese retail landscape, stripping out middlemen to reduce costs and improve efficiency. Apart from Intime, Alibaba has also bought into electronics players Suning Commerce Group Co. and Haier Electronics Group. Chinese retailers could use some help. They’ve struggled in past years to retain consumers frustrated with lackluster, poorly managed malls. Unlike in the U.S., which is controlled by a clutch of mega-chains, the Chinese retail experience is far more fragmented and inconsistent. Intime, one of the better- known players, operated and managed just 29 department stores and 17 shopping malls across the country as of end-June last year, mainly in eastern Zhejiang province. That’s a far cry from the U.S., where nationwide chains such as Wal-Mart and Macy’s Inc. dominate specific strata. More important than geographical reach however is simple store management. While Wal- Mart and Amazon’s logistical machines inspire college case studies, most Chinese retailers still operate in separate, walled-off regions. Management lacks incentive to innovate. Alibaba sees an opportunity in helping such retailers use technology to transform inventory management, while securing a physical network through which it can get goods to its own customers more efficiently, for instance by letting customers pick up orders from stores. “Physical retail in China is backwards compared to elsewhere,” said Catherine Lim, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence in Singapore. “It’s going to be a root-and-branch effort to get the offline side up to standard, and that’s probably why Alibaba felt the need to take it over totally.” Lim cites a familiar example: You have to wait days to find out if there’s a size 10 dress in another branch of the same store. “The players have started to modernize, but it’s been very slow. The truth is that the technology and software is there, it’s whether the people were willing to adapt to it.” The logic of the Intime deal isn’t apparent to all. Alibaba may be counting on success in reviving the mall operator to encourage other retailers to adopt its online-to-offline or O2O model, Chan said. “What’s possible is that Alibaba wants to develop the O2O model and system through this partnership and, once it’s perfected, open up that system for others to use as a platform, like its cloud business,” Chan said. Also, neither Alibaba nor Intime own a lot of the inventory they sell – Intime operates much like a bazaar where different brands run concessions. That means brands will need to be won over. “There is still the missing piece of the people who actually sell the items,” said Chan Wai-Chan, a Hong-Kong based senior partner at Oliver Wyman’s Asia Pacific consumer practice. “Intime is only in Zhejiang, so there won’t be a national reach. Maybe in the grand plan, Alibaba will buy other department stores, since sales of department stores have fallen through the floor.” But Alibaba’s certainly giving it a go. It’s already building a network that will allow physical stores – and the brands they sell – to monitor transactions as they happen. Like Amazon, Alibaba also owns a sprawling collection of online assets, from its budding cloud computing business to mobile search and video entertainment, that could conceivably by combined with physical retail. Shoppers might spot a dress they like on Youku Tudou, run a search via Alibaba’s photo-recognition technology and find 10 similar garments online. Its logistics affiliate, Cainiao, can help retailers identify vacant warehouses and available inventory and match goods with the company’s 450 million active buyers more efficiently. “What Alibaba might want to do is to crunch its marketing, logistics, cloud computing and search and entertainment services all into a package for brands to create value, something they won’t be able to do themselves,” said Julia Pan, a Shanghai-based analyst at UOB Kay Hian.

REUTERS/Rick Wilking Reuters Jan 10, 2017 at 4:19 pm | Print View Wal-Mart Stores Inc. plans to cut hundreds of jobs before the end of January, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the situation. The retailer plans to eliminate jobs at its headquarters and regional personnel that support stores, according to the report. Many of the eliminations will affect Wal-Mart’s human resources department, a large team that some senior executives believe should be more efficient or whose duties could be handled by outside consultants, the newspaper said. Other departments could be affected as well. The company said in September it will cut about 7,000 back-office jobs, mostly in accounting and invoicing positions at its U.S. stores, as part of a program it announced in June.

But it did confirm the jobs were largely in its Bentonville home office and support staff. Insiders told Talk Business & Politics the first of the layoffs will likely begin Friday (Jan. 13). The Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the situation, reported “hundreds of jobs” will be axed before the end of January, which is the retailer’s fiscal year-end. Wal-Mart did not confirm any such figure. “As we’ve previously shared, we are always looking for ways to operate more efficiently and effectively. While we continually look at our corporate structure, we have not made any announcements.  Like any organization, we make decisions based upon what’s best for our business and the customers we serve,” Wal-Mart corporate spokesman Greg Hitt noted in an e-mailed statement. The retailer also is closing at least three Neighborhood Market stores. The stores to be closed are in East Charlotte, S.C. (closing on March 3), Marietta, Ga. (closing March 3) and the Chicago Presidential Towers stores (closing on Jan. 25). Wal-Mart Stores CEO Doug McMillon told analysts in October the retailer will pay attention to its real estate holdings and close some stores in order to remain focused on e-commerce and developing segments like pickup that drive people to the stores. McMillon has said the company must invest more in e-commerce and in-store technology applications that make shopping more convenient. He said the hefty investments – $6 billion and counting – will come at the expense of less capital allocated for new stores. McMillon said existing stores and the corporate offices would be streamlined to run as efficiently as possible. He said positions that directly service stores would take priority over middle management positions that grow in an organization over time. “There are no cash registers in the home office,” McMillon told analysts in June 2015. In the summer of 2016 Wal-Mart said it was cutting about 7,000 back-office jobs and consolidating those operations in centralized locations. About one year ago Walmart U.S. announced plans to close 154 stores, impacting about 10,000 jobs. Sam’s Club also cut about 400 operational jobs and 150 corporate office personnel were given pink slips on Jan. 15, 2016, Talk Business & Politics reported. Jobs placement veteran Cameron Smith said his firm, Cameron Smith & Associates, has been getting phone calls from within Wal-Mart for a few weeks regarding upcoming layoffs. He said the callers are professionals seeking information about other opportunities. He has not had an official call from Wal-Mart about this pending layoff. Smith said the layoffs at Wal-Mart and retail are becoming an annual thing and each year his business acts like a triage unit trying to help the displaced execs find jobs with other local companies. “Wal-Mart will bring in a placement service from out of state that can help the professionals brush up the resumes, but for the folks who want to remain in Northwest Arkansas they usually end up meeting with our firm. Another sign that a layoff is coming is when our Linkedin requests jump substantially from professionals inside Wal-Mart corporate ranks and that is also been happening again,” Smith told Talk Business & Politics. Smith said it’s easier for some of the displaced professionals to remain local, but more than anything else the candidates with transferable skills in the vendor community have the best chance. He said specialty groups like real estate could have a tougher time finding jobs locally with pay equal to their Wal-Mart salaries. The Wal-Mart layoffs come on the heels of several other retail announcements made in the past week. Macy’s will shutter store 63 stores this spring and eliminate about 3,900 jobs. Another 6,000 jobs at Macy’s will be cut over the coming months as it spends more on e-commerce capabilities. Sears is shuttering 150 flagship and Kmart stores in the coming weeks, and The Limited, a women’s apparel chain, is closing all of its 250 stores beginning this week and becoming an online retailer only. Retail analyst Jan Kniffen said this is a new reality for brick and mortar retailers who now have to become omni-channel players. He said it’s an expensive transformation but retailers who want to survive five more years have to make it.

(MEDIA GENERAL/AP) — The Orlando police sergeant who was shot and killed this week was one of the first responders to last summer’s mass shooting at Pulse, a gay nightclub in the city. Police cars surround the Pulse Orlando nightclub, the scene of a fatal shooting, in Orlando, Fla., Sunday, June 12, 2016. (AP Photo/Phelan M. Ebenhack) The Orlando Police Department said Tuesday Master Sgt. Debra Clayton was among the officers who responded to Pulse nightclub as shots rang out during the early morning hours of June 12, 2016. Forty-nine people at the club were killed by gunman Omar Mateen in what is now the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history. On Monday, Clayton was gunned down outside a Walmart as she approached a suspect who was wanted for questioning in the murder of his pregnant girlfriend last December. Markeith Loyd (Twitter/Orange County Sheriff’s Office) Suspect Markeith Loyd fled the scene, and a $100,000 reward is now being offered for information leading to his arrest. Loyd, 41, has a criminal record that dates back two decades, including a murder charge in 1996 that was later dropped and battery on an officer in 1998. Records show he was released from prison in July 2014. Clayton, a 17-year veteran of the Orlando Police Department, leaves behind a husband and a son. A GoFundMe has been set up to raise money to help her family. Orlando police officer shooting View as list View as gallery Open Gallery Orlando Police Master Sgt.

Walmart opens its newest Training Academy Tuesday dedicated to teaching front-line supervisors skills in the classroom that apply on the sales floor in Hatfield. Anthony SalamoneContact ReporterOf The Morning Call Giant retailer Wal-Mart taking some of its supervisors to school — its own HATFIELD TOWNSHIP, Montgomery County — Chris Dunn has worked in various jobs with Wal-Mart, rising through the ranks from stock clerk to assistant manager in his 16 years with the mass merchandiser. These days, however, he wears a new ID tag on his blue vest: "Academy Facilitator 1." Wal-Mart on Tuesday celebrated the grand opening of the first Pennsylvania Wal-Mart Training Academy in Hatfield Township, Montgomery County, as well as its first graduating class. The academy, off Route 309 inside a Wal-Mart Supercenter, is the 41st in the U.S., according to the company. It will serve about 20 stores from the Lehigh and Delaware valleys. The goal of the academy — a two-week program — is to improve supervisors' core retail skills so they can run specific departments. Or as Dunn puts it, the academy empowers workers to understand their work and take more ownership of their jobs and customers' needs.

(ADDISON GEORGE / SPECIAL TO THE MORNING CALL) Wal-Mart critics, including Making Change at Wal-Mart, a group sponsored by the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, have faulted the mass retailer for the lack of sufficient employee coaching in dealing with customers. Dunn, 45, admitted as much during an interview at the academy. "I feel as a company we had a need to spend more time with associates and to help teach and train them and develop them into our future leaders," Dunn said. "We were at a point in the company that we were growing so fast, our talent wasn't growing fast enough with it."

See more videos When Wal-Mart launched the academy — part of a $2.7 billion corporate investment announced in 2015 that also included higher employee wages — Dunn said he jumped at the chance to teach. "Are we going to make mistakes?" Dunn said. "Sure, but part of this program is to minimize the mistakes we make and give our hourly supervisors the tools to rectify those mistakes." Said Making Change spokeswoman Meredith Ritchie: "While past behavior requires me to remain hesitant to take Wal-Mart at its word, if the company truly is committed to providing workers with more hands-on training and career advancement, that is a positive development." Retail analyst Jeff Green said Wal-Mart is starting to see the advantage of providing employees with better customer service skills, in addition to offering lower prices. . "And if they can combine price with service, it will be a huge win," said Green, who is president of Jeff Green Partners in Phoenix. The Bentonville, Ark., retailer says it plans to open 200 academies across the country by the end of the year that will train more than 140,000 hourly supervisors and managers a year. Wal-Mart plans to open two more academies in central and western Pennsylvania.

A manhunt continues as law enforcement officials search for the suspect in the shooting. next play/pause pre Hamilton Spectator By Mike Schneider ORLANDO, Fla. — Law enforcement officers in Orlando were engaged in a massive manhunt early Tuesday for a man accused of fatally shooting a police officer who approached him outside a Walmart. The manhunt itself has led to the death of a sheriff's deputy in a traffic accident and the injury of another officer. Master Sgt. Debra Clayton, 42, was killed outside the Walmart store in northwest Orlando early Monday, and Orange County Sheriff's Office Deputy 1st Class Norman Lewis was killed more than two hours later in a crash while responding to a manhunt for Markeith Loyd, 41. The deaths left Orlando's law enforcement community in mourning. Clayton's patrol SUV was displayed in front of police headquarters Tuesday. The department also started an online fund to raise money for her family. In the Walmart parking lot Tuesday morning, shoppers laid more than two dozen bouquets of flowers, teddy bears and candles in a makeshift memorial. Some shoppers, like Hal Shore, stopped to say a prayer or take a photo. "It's important that the country is aware that there is a war against police officers," said Shore, a cabinet maker. An apartment complex that was the focus of the manhunt Monday afternoon didn't appear to have any police searches going on Tuesday morning, but Orlando Police Chief John Mina said hundreds of officers and deputies were still searching for Loyd and teams of detectives were following every lead. "We will not stop until we find him," Mina said in a video on the agency's official Twitter page. "We are doing everything in our power to find him and capture him and put him behind bars." Authorities said Loyd previously was a suspect in the killing of his pregnant ex-girlfriend in December. A massive manhunt involving hundreds of officers was conducted all day Monday as they searched for Loyd in dozens of homes, displacing some residents of a northwest Orlando apartment complex and tying up traffic. "He should be considered armed and dangerous," Mina said. Later in the day, the chief said, "It doesn't matter where he is. We will track him down to the ends of the Earth." Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said deputies had been searching unsuccessfully for Loyd for several weeks since the fatal shooting of his ex-girlfriend and believe he was receiving help from someone. Mina lauded Clayton, a 17-year veteran of the force, as a committed officer and a hero who gave her life to the community she loves. The Orlando Police Department said in a tweet that Clayton always had a smile and a high five for every child she came across. Clayton had grown up in the Orlando area and was active in programs that mentored young people. "She was always the first to step up and help kids," Mina said. Clayton was a supervisor for a patrol division in the neighbourhood where she was shot, and she previously had worked in investigations and as a school resource officer, Deputy Chief Orlando Rolon said. "She made a point, even outside her working hours, to do things for youth and do things for the community," Rolon said. She was married and had a college-age son. Police released a video of Clayton's body being taken out of the hospital to a waiting van in a flag-covered stretcher. A line of officers saluted as the stretcher was wheeled out. The apartment complex that was the focus of the manhunt and shooting in northwest Orlando was nowhere near Orlando's tourism corridor in the southern part of the metro area. Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer declared a day of mourning in the city. While at the Walmart on Monday morning, Clayton was tipped off by someone that Loyd was in the area. When she approached him, he fired multiple shots at Clayton, who returned fire but didn't hit him. She was wearing body armour, but was hit multiple times. Sheriff's officials said a deputy spotted Loyd fleeing in a vehicle. The suspect pulled into a nearby apartment complex and then fired at a deputy, striking the deputy's SUV twice. The deputy wasn't harmed, the sheriff's office said. Loyd then carjacked another vehicle, drove away and then abandoned the vehicle not far away, according to the sheriff's office. The Orange County Sheriff's Office deputy was killed more than two hours after the shooting when a van collided with his motorcycle as he responded to the manhunt. Demings described the 35-year-old Lewis as "a gentle giant," and the sheriff's office said he had played football for the University of Central Florida before joining the agency 11 years ago.

The manhunt for Loyd has already led to several injuries and the death of Orange County Sheriff's Deputy 1st Class Norman Lewis, who died in a motorcycle crash while searching for him. As hundreds of law enforcement officers scramble to find a man called "armed and extremely dangerous," here are the latest developments: Reward raised to $100,000 Authorities increased the reward for information leading to Loyd's arrest to $100,000, Orlando police Chief John Mina said Tuesday. "The Orlando Police Department, the Orange County Sheriff's Office, the FBI, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, homeland security, the U.S. marshals -- everyone is working to capture him," he said earlier. "We believe that people who know where he is will want that money," he said. Suspect said he wanted to be on 'America's Most Wanted' Two weeks before Loyd was accused of killing his pregnant girlfriend, Sade Dixon, he posted a message on Facebook: "Goals!!!! To be on Americas most wanted". On Monday morning, Clayton received word that Loyd was near a local Walmart. She tried to confront him. "As soon as she said, 'Stop,' he basically opened fire on her," Mina said. A witness outside the Walmart described a similar scene. "I was walking down the sidewalk, right past the officer, and I heard her tell him to stop, or whatever, and he shot her," witness James Herman told CNN affiliate WFTV-TV in Orlando. "He shot her down." Fund established for officer's family Clayton was the mother of a college-age son, and Orlando police said many people have been asking how they can help. Already, however, some people have tried to profit from the officer's death. "Unfortunately, after tragic events like this, there are evil people out there who are looking to take advantage of our community, and there have already been two fake GoFundMe accounts," Mina said. He urged anyone wanting to donate to visit the verified GoFundMe page for Clayton's family. Clayton was a first responder to Pulse massacre Clayton's death was the latest blow for the Orlando Police Department, which is still reeling from the June massacre at the Pulse nightclub that left 49 people dead. "Unfortunately we still have officers that are struggling with the Pulse tragedy," the police chief said. "It's been a tough seven or eight months for us." Clayton responded moments after the mass shooting at the club, police spokeswoman Michelle Guido said. "Like many of other officers here, she was a first responder that had to go to Pulse in the early morning hours to assist," Mina said. The pursuit After the shooting, Loyd fled in a car and fired shots at another officer, police said. That officer was not seriously injured. The suspect then abandoned the first vehicle and carjacked another one. He ditched that second vehicle shortly afterward and ran into an apartment complex, Mina said. It's unclear where he is now. But a "be on the lookout" alert has been sent nationwide, which is standard procedure with Florida murder suspects, said Guido, the police spokeswoman. "I believe there have been people out there helping him all along," Mina said. "If we find out about those people, we will criminally charge them." He said Loyd would be charged with first-degree murder of a law enforcement officer and attempted murder of the officer at whom he fired. Colleagues mourn deaths of longtime officers Two departments must now hunt for the suspect while grieving the deaths of their colleagues. Clayton, the Orlando police master sergeant, was married and the mother of a college-age son. "I've known Debra for 17 years. She was extremely committed to our youth and the community," the police chief said. "She did so many different projects in the community. She organized several marches against violence by herself." Lewis, the sheriff's deputy killed in the crash, was also known as "Big Norm," friends said. "'Big Norm' was known as much for his infectious ear-to-ear smile as he was his 6-foot-3, nearly 300-pound towering frame," Orlando attorney Brian Sandor said. "His smile and laugh took over any room he was in." Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said his department is grappling with the loss. But "while we're processing our own emotional feelings," he said, "we still have a job to do." Attorney general nominee refers to Orlando During his confirmation hearing Tuesday on Capitol Hill, the US attorney general nominee, Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama, spoke about the dual tragedies that happened on National Law Enforcement Appreciation Day. "Sadly, on that day, we lost two of our brave officers," Sessions said. He said Clayton and Lewis "dedicated their lives to keeping their communities safe, and we should remember their service and keep them and their families in our prayers." CNN's Nick Valencia reported from Orlando, and CNN's Holly Yan reported and wrote from Atlanta.

By Steven Dubois Associated Press Twitter Facebook  Email  Reddit  SMS PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) – A felon armed with a machete slashed three men at a Woodburn apartment complex after running through a Walmart with the weapon and threatening to kill a store greeter on his way out, authorities said Tuesday. Woodburn city spokesman Jason Horton said police responded to Walmart shortly after 10 p.m. Monday. They had been alerted a man was shattering glass cabinets and stealing ammunition. Witnesses told police that Alan Lee Brock ran through the store with the machete, swinging it at the Walmart greeter as he was leaving and verbally threatening to kill him. “It came pretty close to him,” Horton said. Officers found the 29-year-old Brock parked outside the store in a car that had been reported stolen in Springfield, 80 miles south. The suspect drove slowly before speeding up and getting away. Horton said he aimed the vehicle toward officers before quickly turning and driving over an embankment. Police were soon called to a nearby apartment complex, where they say Brock tried to rob a woman for her purse and car keys before breaking down an apartment door and slashing three men. He slashed one across the throat, one on the head and one on the arm. Horton said the three were taken to a hospital with injuries not considered life-threatening. Officers found Brock on a stairwell and he surrendered without further commotion, Horton said. Brock was jailed on three counts of attempted murder. Court records do not list an attorney to speak on his behalf. Brock’s arrest record stretches back to his teenage years, with charges including robbery, burglary, theft and felon in possession of a firearm. His most recent conviction was in October for heroin possession. He was sentenced to 10 days in the Lane County Jail along with probation and a suspension of his driving license.

(AP) — The Latest on the fatal shooting of an Orlando police officer (all times local): 2:40 p.m. Authorities have increased the reward to $100,000 for information leading to the arrest of a suspect in the slaying of an Orlando police sergeant. Free e-book on the latest federal government cybersecurity initiatives. Download now. Orlando Police Chief John Mina announced at a news conference on Tuesday that the reward is being raised from $60,000 to $100,000 for information leading to the arrest of 41-year-old Markeith Loyd. Advertisement Authorities also said that arrests warrants are being prepared for people who may have helped Loyd elude deputies who have sought to question him in the murder of his pregnant ex-girlfriend. Master Sgt. Debra Clayton was killed Monday after she approached Loyd in a store parking lot. The manhunt for Loyd entered a second day on Tuesday. Authorities say they have received 300 tips from the public. ___ 2:30 p.m. The suspect who is the focus of a manhunt for the slaying of an Orlando police sergeant has a criminal record going back two decades. Court records show 41-year-old Markeith Loyd was arrested in 1996 on a murder charge that was later dropped. Loyd was arrested for battery on an officer in 1998 and sentenced to more than four years in prison. While in prison he was detained on federal drug charges, pleaded guilty to cocaine possession and was transferred to federal prison. Records show Loyd was released in July 2014. Now Loyd is wanted for the fatal shooting of Master Sgt. Debra Clayton Monday morning, who approached him in a Wal-Mart parking lot for questioning in the murder of a pregnant ex-girlfriend. ___ 1:25 p.m. The Orlando police sergeant who was gunned down in a Wal-Mart parking lot was one of the first responders to a mass shooting at a gay nightclub. The Orlando Police Department on Tuesday confirmed that Master Sgt. Debra Clayton was one of the officers who responded to the shooting at Pulse in which 49 patrons were killed. Last June’s massacre in Orlando was the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Authorities say Clayton was gunned down Monday morning in a Wal-Mart parking lot after she approached a suspect who was wanted for questioning in the slaying last December of his pregnant girlfriend. A manhunt for suspect Markeith Loyd was in its second day on Tuesday. ___ 12:30 p.m. Orlando Police Chief John Mina says his agency is doing everything it can to catch a suspect wanted in the fatal shooting of a police sergeant. Mina said Tuesday that teams of detectives are following all leads and hundreds of officers and deputies are searching for suspect Markeith Loyd. Mina spoke in a video posted on the agency’s Twitter page. Authorities say Master Sgt. Debra Clayton was gunned down Monday morning in a Wal-Mart parking lot after she approached Loyd, who was wanted for questioning in the murder of his pregnant girlfriend. Officers focused the manhunt on an apartment complex Monday afternoon, but no searches appeared to be going on there Tuesday morning. ___ 11 a.m. Shoppers are laying flowers, teddy bears and candles in the parking lot of a Wal-Mart store where an Orlando police sergeant was gunned down as she approached a suspect wanted for questioning in the murder of his pregnant ex-girlfriend. More than two dozen bouquets were displayed Tuesday morning in the parking lot outside a Wal-Mart in northwest Orlando where Master Sgt. Debra Clayton was killed the day before. Shoppers stopped by to take photos or say a prayer. Shopper Hal Shore says in his opinion, Clayton’s death is a reminder that there is a “war” against police officers in the United States. Law enforcement officers spent a second day searching for the suspect wanted in Clayton’s murder. ___ 9:20 a.m. The patrol car of an Orlando police sergeant fatally shot outside a Wal-Mart store is being displayed in front of Orlando Police headquarters as scores of law enforcement officers spend a second day conducting a manhunt for the suspect in her shooting. Master Sgt. Debra Clayton’s patrol SUV was parked Tuesday outside the agency’s headquarters in downtown Orlando. The police department also started an online fund to raise money for her family. The manhunt for suspect Markeith Loyd entered its second day Tuesday. Clayton had approached Loyd outside the store after someone tipped her off that he was in the area. He was wanted for questioning in the murder of his pregnant ex-girlfriend. ___ 4:25 a.m. Orlando’s law enforcement community is mourning the death of two officers amid the search for a suspect. Authorities say Orlando Police Master Sgt. Debra Clayton was fatally shot Monday morning when she approached a fugitive wanted for questioning in the killing of his pregnant ex-girlfriend. More than two hours later, Orange County Sheriff’s Office Deputy First Class Norman Lewis was killed when his motorcycle collided with a van as he was responding to a manhunt in search of the 41-year-old Markeith Loyd, the suspect in Clayton’s shooting. Authorities say someone in a Wal-Mart store had tipped off the sergeant that Loyd was in the area. She was shot after she approached him outside the store. Loyd fled the area and a manhunt involving hundreds of law enforcement officers was conducted around an apartment complex in northwest Orlando.

REUTERS/Rick Wilking Don't miss stories. Follow Raw Story! Follow @rawstory Wal-Mart Stores Inc has been ordered by a federal judge to pay $16.08 million to a former New Hampshire pharmacist in a gender bias case, but the amount is only about half what a jury awarded and may fall substantially further. U.S. District Judge Steven McAuliffe also asked the New Hampshire Supreme Court to advise whether the plaintiff Maureen McPadden was entitled under state law to any of the $15 million of “enhanced” damages that comprised most of the award. Though “reasonable minds can differ,” Wal-Mart “asserts – not implausibly” that such damages are not available, the Concord, New Hampshire judge wrote on Jan. 6. Wal-Mart had no immediate comment on Tuesday, but the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer has said it does not tolerate discrimination. McPadden accused the world’s largest retailer of using her loss of a pharmacy key as a pretext for her November 2012 dismissal from a store in Seabrook, New Hampshire, after more than 13 years at the retailer. She said Wal-Mart actually fired her in retaliation for her raising concerns about whether prescriptions were being filled properly. McPadden also said her gender played a role, saying a male pharmacist who later lost his key was not fired. Jurors originally awarded McPadden $31.22 million, a sum that McAuliffe said was “to say the least, startling.” The judge later reduced the punitive damages component to $300,000 from $15 million as required by federal law, and in a Jan. 5 order said McPadden deserved just $111,591 of front pay, one-fifth what the jury had awarded. Wal-Mart had sought to overturn the entire verdict, but McAuliffe rejected that request in September. Rick Fradette, a lawyer for McPadden, said that if enhanced damages were ever warranted, “it is where the world’s largest private employer continues to discriminate against women in the 21st century. “Wal-Mart’s posture has been that it will fight this to the end,” he said. “We’ll see what the New Hampshire Supreme Court has to say.” The case is McPadden v. Wal-Mart Stores East LP, U.S. District Court, District of New Hampshire, No. 14-00475.

Holiday White Peppermint Hostess Twinkies, which were recalled because they contained powdered milk that might have been contaminated. FDA  The confectionery coating in Hostess Holiday White Peppermint Twinkies was made with milk powder ingredients recalled by Valley Milk because of concerns it contained salmonella, the Food and Drug Administration announced Monday. Hostess recalled the Twinkies voluntarily. The FDA also said Palmer-branded chocolate products as well as unbranded bulk candy and specific products made under Wal-Mart's "The Bakery" brand were voluntarily pulled out of stores. The Twinkies recall only applies to  the White Peppermint Hostess Twinkies, sold in multi-pack boxes of nine.  The Palmer candies were produced between Oct. 20, 2016 and Dec. 9, 2016 and have expiration dates as late as August 2017. A complete list of Palmer-recalled chocolates, cookies and candies can be found here.   There have been no reports of illness as a result of the recalled products being eaten, the FDA said. Salmonella can cause fever, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare instances, it can lead to arterial infections (i.e., infected aneurysms), endocarditis and arthritis.  Customers are advised not to eat any of the named products and to return them to where they were bought for a refund.

The manhunt itself has led to the death of a sheriff’s deputy in a traffic accident and the injury of another officer. Master Sgt. Debra Clayton, 42, was killed outside the Wal-Mart store in northwest Orlando early Monday, and Orange County Sheriff’s Office Deputy 1st Class Norman Lewis was killed more than two hours later in a crash while responding to a manhunt for Markeith Loyd, 41.

(AP Photo/John Raoux) The deaths left Orlando’s law enforcement community in mourning. Clayton’s patrol SUV was displayed in front of police headquarters Tuesday. The department also started an online fund to raise money for her family. In the Wal-Mart parking lot Tuesday morning, shoppers laid more than two dozen bouquets of flowers, teddy bears and candles in a makeshift memorial. Some shoppers, like Hal Shore, stopped to say a prayer or take a photo. “It’s important that the country is aware that there is a war against police officers,” said Shore, a cabinet maker. An apartment complex that was the focus of the manhunt Monday afternoon didn’t appear to have any police searches going on Tuesday morning, but Orlando Police Chief John Mina said hundreds of officers and deputies were still searching for Loyd and teams of detectives were following every lead. “We will not stop until we find him,” Mina said in a video on the agency’s official Twitter page. “We are doing everything in our power to find him and capture him and put him behind bars.” Authorities said Loyd previously was a suspect in the killing of his pregnant ex-girlfriend in December. A massive manhunt involving hundreds of officers was conducted all day Monday as they searched for Loyd in dozens of homes, displacing some residents of a northwest Orlando apartment complex and tying up traffic. “He should be considered armed and dangerous,” Police Chief John Mina said. Later in the day, the chief said, “It doesn’t matter where he is. We will track him down to the ends of the Earth.” Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said deputies had been searching unsuccessfully for Loyd for several weeks since the fatal shooting of his ex-girlfriend and believe he was receiving help from someone. Mina lauded Clayton, a 17-year veteran of the force, as a committed officer and a hero who gave her life to the community she loves. The Orlando Police Department said in a tweet that Clayton always had a smile and a high five for every child she came across. Clayton had grown up in the Orlando area and was active in programs that mentored young people. “She was always the first to step up and help kids,” Mina said. Clayton was a supervisor for a patrol division in the neighborhood where she was shot, and she previously had worked in investigations and as a school resource officer, Deputy Chief Orlando Rolon said. “She made a point, even outside her working hours, to do things for youth and do things for the community,” Rolon said. She was married and had a college-age son. Police released a video of Clayton’s body being taken out of the hospital to a waiting van in a flag-covered stretcher. A line of officers saluted as the stretcher was wheeled out. The apartment complex that was the focus of the manhunt and shooting in northwest Orlando was nowhere near Orlando’s tourism corridor in the southern part of the metro area. Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer declared a day of mourning in the city. While at the Wal-Mart on Monday morning, Clayton was tipped off by someone that Loyd was in the area. When she approached him, he fired multiple shots at Clayton, who returned fire but didn’t hit him. She was wearing body armor, but was hit multiple times. Sheriff’s officials said a deputy spotted Loyd fleeing in a vehicle. The suspect pulled into a nearby apartment complex and then fired at a deputy, striking the deputy’s SUV twice. The deputy wasn’t harmed, the sheriff’s office said. Loyd then carjacked another vehicle, drove away and then abandoned the vehicle not far away, according to the sheriff’s office. The Orange County Sheriff’s Office deputy was killed more than two hours after the shooting when a van collided with his motorcycle as he responded to the manhunt. Demings described the 35-year-old Lewis as “a gentle giant,” and the sheriff’s office said he had played football for the University of Central Florida before joining the agency 11 years ago.

The Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer plans to eliminate jobs at its headquarters and regional personnel that support stores, according to the report. http://on.wsj.com/2jroYGF Many of the eliminations will affect Wal-Mart's human resources department, a large team that some senior executives believe should be more efficient or whose duties could be handled by outside consultants, the newspaper reported. Other departments could be affected as well, the report said. "While we continually look at our corporate structure, we have not made any announcements," Wal-Mart spokesman Randy Hargrove said in an email. The company said in September it would cut about 7,000 back-office jobs, mostly in accounting and invoicing positions at its U.S. stores, as part of a program it announced in June. The job cuts followed the company's plans to invest $2.7 billion in programs that involve training its workforce and a series of wage hikes that took the minimum hourly pay for store workers to $10, part of efforts to improve service at stores and boost sales. The company has also been investing to increase e-commerce sales and improve stores. These measures helped the company report strong online sales growth and a smaller-than-expected decline in earnings for the third quarter despite comparable store sales coming in below estimates. Wal-Mart's shares were down marginally at $68.48 in afternoon trading.

The retailer plans to eliminate jobs at its headquarters and regional personnel that support stores, according to the report. http://on.wsj.com/2jroYGF Many of the eliminations will affect Wal-Mart's human resources department, a large team that some senior executives believe should be more efficient or whose duties could be handled by outside consultants, the newspaper said. Other departments could be affected as well. The company said in September it will cut about 7,000 back-office jobs, mostly in accounting and invoicing positions at its U.S. stores, as part of a program it announced in June. Wal-Mart was not immediately available for comment.

(Stephen M. Dowell | Orlando Sentinel via Tribune News Service) The Associated Press ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — Law enforcement officers in Orlando were engaged in a massive manhunt early Tuesday for a man accused of fatally shooting a police officer who approached him outside a Wal-Mart. The manhunt itself has led to the death of a sheriff's deputy in a traffic accident and the injury of another officer. Master Sgt. Debra Clayton, 42, was killed outside the Wal-Mart store in northwest Orlando early Monday, and Orange County Sheriff's Office Deputy 1st Class Norman Lewis was killed more than two hours later in a crash while responding to a manhunt for Markeith Loyd, 41. The deaths left Orlando's law enforcement community in mourning. Clayton's patrol SUV was displayed in front of police headquarters Tuesday. The department also started an online fund to raise money for her family. In the Wal-Mart parking lot Tuesday morning, shoppers laid more than two dozen bouquets of flowers, teddy bears and candles in a makeshift memorial. Some shoppers, like Hal Shore, stopped to say a prayer or take a photo. "It's important that the country is aware that there is a war against police officers," said Shore, a cabinet maker. An apartment complex that was the focus of the manhunt Monday afternoon didn't appear to have any police searches going on Tuesday morning, but Orlando Police Chief John Mina said hundreds of officers and deputies were still searching for Loyd and teams of detectives were following every lead. "We will not stop until we find him," Mina said in a video on the agency's official Twitter page. "We are doing everything in our power to find him and capture him and put him behind bars." Authorities said Loyd previously was a suspect in the killing of his pregnant ex-girlfriend in December. A massive manhunt involving hundreds of officers was conducted all day Monday as they searched for Loyd in dozens of homes, displacing some residents of a northwest Orlando apartment complex and tying up traffic. "He should be considered armed and dangerous," Police Chief John Mina said. Later in the day, the chief said, "It doesn't matter where he is. We will track him down to the ends of the Earth." Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said deputies had been searching unsuccessfully for Loyd for several weeks since the fatal shooting of his ex-girlfriend and believe he was receiving help from someone. Mina lauded Clayton, a 17-year veteran of the force, as a committed officer and a hero who gave her life to the community she loves. The Orlando Police Department said in a tweet that Clayton always had a smile and a high five for every child she came across. Clayton had grown up in the Orlando area and was active in programs that mentored young people. "She was always the first to step up and help kids," Mina said. Clayton was a supervisor for a patrol division in the neighborhood where she was shot, and she previously had worked in investigations and as a school resource officer, Deputy Chief Orlando Rolon said. "She made a point, even outside her working hours, to do things for youth and do things for the community," Rolon said. She was married and had a college-age son. Police released a video of Clayton's body being taken out of the hospital to a waiting van in a flag-covered stretcher. A line of officers saluted as the stretcher was wheeled out. The apartment complex that was the focus of the manhunt and shooting in northwest Orlando was nowhere near Orlando's tourism corridor in the southern part of the metro area. Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer declared a day of mourning in the city. While at the Wal-Mart on Monday morning, Clayton was tipped off by someone that Loyd was in the area. When she approached him, he fired multiple shots at Clayton, who returned fire but didn't hit him. She was wearing body armor, but was hit multiple times. Sheriff's officials said a deputy spotted Loyd fleeing in a vehicle. The suspect pulled into a nearby apartment complex and then fired at a deputy, striking the deputy's SUV twice. The deputy wasn't harmed, the sheriff's office said. Loyd then carjacked another vehicle, drove away and then abandoned the vehicle not far away, according to the sheriff's office. The Orange County Sheriff's Office deputy was killed more than two hours after the shooting when a van collided with his motorcycle as he responded to the manhunt. Demings described the 35-year-old Lewis as "a gentle giant," and the sheriff's office said he had played football for the University of Central Florida before joining the agency 11 years ago.

A $60-thousand-dollar reward is being offered for information for Markeith Loyd, the suspected shooter in the death of the Orlando Police Department officer Master Sargent Debra Clayton on Monday, January 9, 2017, according to a tweet from the Orlando... By Holly Yan and Nick Valencia CNN ORLANDO (CNN) -- The massive search for a man suspected of killing his pregnant girlfriend and gunning down an Orlando police officer has expanded beyond Florida, police said Tuesday. Markeith Loyd has been on the run since Monday morning when police say he killed Master Sgt. Debra Clayton as she tried to confront the murder suspect outside a Walmart. The manhunt for Loyd has already led to several injuries and the death of Orange County Sheriff's Deputy 1st Class Norman Lewis, who died in a motorcycle crash while searching for him. As hundreds of law enforcement officers scramble to find a man called "armed and extremely dangerous," here are the latest developments: Reward raised to $100,000 Authorities increased the reward for information leading to Loyd's arrest to $100,000, Orlando police Chief John Mina said Tuesday. "The Orlando Police Department, the Orange County Sheriff's Office, the FBI, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, homeland security, the U.S. marshals -- everyone is working to capture him," he said earlier. "We believe that people who know where he is will want that money," he said. Suspect said he wanted to be on 'America's Most Wanted' Two weeks before Loyd was accused of killing his pregnant girlfriend, Sade Dixon, he posted a message on Facebook: "Goals!!!! To be on Americas most wanted". On Monday morning, Clayton received word that Loyd was near a local Walmart. She tried to confront him. "As soon as she said, 'Stop,' he basically opened fire on her," Mina said. A witness outside the Walmart described a similar scene. "I was walking down the sidewalk, right past the officer, and I heard her tell him to stop, or whatever, and he shot her," witness James Herman told CNN affiliate WFTV-TV in Orlando. "He shot her down." Fund established for officer's family Clayton was the mother of a college-age son, and Orlando police said many people have been asking how they can help. Already, however, some people have tried to profit from the officer's death. "Unfortunately, after tragic events like this, there are evil people out there who are looking to take advantage of our community, and there have already been two fake GoFundMe accounts," Mina said. He urged anyone wanting to donate to visit the verified GoFundMe page for Clayton's family. Clayton was a first responder to Pulse massacre Clayton's death was the latest blow for the Orlando Police Department, which is still reeling from the June massacre at the Pulse nightclub that left 49 people dead. "Unfortunately we still have officers that are struggling with the Pulse tragedy," the police chief said. "It's been a tough seven or eight months for us." Clayton responded moments after the mass shooting at the club, police spokeswoman Michelle Guido said. "Like many of other officers here, she was a first responder that had to go to Pulse in the early morning hours to assist," Mina said. The pursuit After the shooting, Loyd fled in a car and fired shots at another officer, police said. That officer was not seriously injured. The suspect then abandoned the first vehicle and carjacked another one. He ditched that second vehicle shortly afterward and ran into an apartment complex, Mina said. It's unclear where he is now. But a "be on the lookout" alert has been sent nationwide, which is standard procedure with Florida murder suspects, said Guido, the police spokeswoman. "I believe there have been people out there helping him all along," Mina said. "If we find out about those people, we will criminally charge them." He said Loyd would be charged with first-degree murder of a law enforcement officer and attempted murder of the officer at whom he fired. Colleagues mourn deaths of longtime officers Two departments must now hunt for the suspect while grieving the deaths of their colleagues. Clayton, the Orlando police master sergeant, was married and the mother of a college-age son. "I've known Debra for 17 years. She was extremely committed to our youth and the community," the police chief said. "She did so many different projects in the community. She organized several marches against violence by herself." Lewis, the sheriff's deputy killed in the crash, was also known as "Big Norm," friends said. "'Big Norm' was known as much for his infectious ear-to-ear smile as he was his 6-foot-3, nearly 300-pound towering frame," Orlando attorney Brian Sandor said. "His smile and laugh took over any room he was in." Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said his department is grappling with the loss. But "while we're processing our own emotional feelings," he said, "we still have a job to do." Attorney general nominee refers to Orlando During his confirmation hearing Tuesday on Capitol Hill, the US attorney general nominee, Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama, spoke about the dual tragedies that happened on National Law Enforcement Appreciation Day. "Sadly, on that day, we lost two of our brave officers," Sessions said. He said Clayton and Lewis "dedicated their lives to keeping their communities safe, and we should remember their service and keep them and their families in our prayers." CNN's Nick Valencia reported from Orlando, and CNN's Holly Yan reported and wrote from Atlanta.

Alan BrockWoodburn Police Department  Police responded around 10 p.m. to the Walmart in Woodburn on reports that a man was breaking glass cabinets and taking ammunition, police said in a news release. Witnesses told officers that the man, later identified as Alan Lee Brock, had run around the store with a machete and threatened a door greeter, said city spokesman Jason Horton. Officers found Brock inside a parked car at the front of the store's north entrance, but he drove away, Horton said. The car initially headed toward the officers standing near their cars before it jumped an embankment onto a nearby street. Officers later learned the car was stolen from Springfield, Horton said. Shortly after, 911 dispatchers began receiving calls about a man with a machete at the Cascade View Apartments, less than a mile away. Horton said Brock assaulted and robbed a woman for her purse and keys. "He then broke down a door to an apartment and slashed three men with the machete," Horton said. "He slashed one across the throat, one on the head and one on the arm." The three men were rushed to the hospital, Horton said. They're expected to survive, he said. The attack appear to be random, he said. Brock was later found on a stairwell, where he surrendered without incident. Horton said he didn't know the suspect's age or his hometown. Brock was booked into a Marion County Jail on accusations of attempted murder, with more charges pending.

Debra Clayton, 42, was killed outside the Wal-Mart store in northwest Orlando early Monday, and Orange County Sheriff's Office Deputy 1st Class Norman Lewis was killed more than two hours later in a crash while responding to a manhunt for Markeith Loyd, 41. Another Orlando police officer was involved in a crash while responding to the shooting but had only minor injuries. The deaths left Orlando's law enforcement community in mourning. Clayton's patrol SUV was displayed in front of Orlando Police headquarters Tuesday morning. The police department also started an online fund to raise money for her family. In the Wal-Mart parking lot Tuesday morning, shoppers laid more than two dozen bouquets of flowers, teddy bears and candles in a makeshift memorial. Some shoppers, like Hal Shore, stopped to say a prayer or take a photo. "It's important that the country is aware that there is a war against police officers," said Shore, a cabinet maker. Authorities said Loyd previously was a suspect in the killing of his pregnant ex-girlfriend in December. A massive manhunt involving hundreds of officers was conducted all day Monday as they searched for Loyd in dozens of homes, displacing some residents of a northwest Orlando apartment complex and tying up traffic. "He should be considered armed and dangerous," Police Chief John Mina said. Later in the day, the chief said, "It doesn't matter where he is. We will track him down to the ends of the Earth." Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said deputies had been searching unsuccessfully for Loyd for several weeks since the fatal shooting of his ex-girlfriend and believe he was receiving help from someone. Mina lauded Clayton, a 17-year veteran of the force, as a committed officer and a hero who gave her life to the community she loves. The Orlando Police Department said in a tweet that Clayton always had a smile and a high five for every child she came across. Clayton had grown up in the Orlando area and was active in programs that mentored young people. "She was always the first to step up and help kids," Mina said. Clayton was a supervisor for a patrol division in the neighborhood where she was shot, and she previously had worked in investigations and as a school resource officer, Deputy Chief Orlando Rolon said. "She made a point, even outside her working hours, to do things for youth and do things for the community," Rolon said. She was married and had a college-age son. Police released a video of Clayton's body being taken out of the hospital to a waiting van in a flag-covered stretcher. A line of officers saluted as the stretcher was wheeled out. The apartment complex that was the focus of the manhunt and shooting in northwest Orlando was nowhere near Orlando's tourism corridor in the southern part of the metro area. Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer declared a day of mourning in the city. While at the Wal-Mart on Monday morning, Clayton was tipped off by someone that Loyd was in the area. When she approached him, he fired multiple shots at Clayton, who returned fire but didn't hit him. She was wearing body armor, but was hit multiple times. Sheriff's officials said a deputy spotted Loyd fleeing in a vehicle. The suspect pulled into a nearby apartment complex and then fired at a deputy, striking the deputy's SUV twice. The deputy wasn't harmed, the sheriff's office said. Loyd then carjacked another vehicle, drove away and then abandoned the vehicle not far away, according to the sheriff's office. The Orange County Sheriff's Office deputy was killed more than two hours after the shooting when a van collided with his motorcycle as he responded to the manhunt. Demings described the 35-year-old Lewis as "a gentle giant," and the sheriff's office said he had played football for the University of Central Florida before joining the agency 11 years ago.

(Woodburn Police/Google Street View) PORTLAND, Ore. (KOIN) — A man was arrested on Monday evening in Woodburn for running around a Walmart store with a machete and then slashing three people with it. The machete used by Brock. (Woodburn Police) Woodburn public information officer Jason Horton says police began receiving calls about a man, later identified as Allen Lee Brock, acting erratically at the Shell gas station on N Arney Rd. “He left there before police even got to the Shell station, and then we started getting calls from Walmart,” Horton said. Woodburn Police say Brock traveled to the nearby Walmart store around 10 p.m., where he broke out glass cabinets to steal ammunition and a machete. He then allegedly swung the machete at a door greeter and said he was going to kill him. Police arrived on scene as Brock was fleeing in a car later found to be stolen out of Springfield. Authorities say Brock next went to the Cascade View Apartments on S. Evergreen Road. He tried to rob and assault a woman for her purse and keys. He then broke down a door to an apartment and slashed three men with the machete. One was slashed in the throat, one on the head and one on the arm. All three were taken to the hospital. Multiple police agencies responded to the apartment complex. “There were at least 15 police vehicles here,” said Cascade View resident Leah Hinkle. “Two policemen that came to our door had assault rifles, and then they said ‘Please shut your doors, lock them, and don’t let anyone else in your apartment.'” Brock was later located inside one of the apartment buildings, where he was arrested without incident. “The crime appears to be completely random,” said Horton. “The victims didn’t know him. He’s not from the area. He’s not known to Woodburn police.” Brock has been charged with three counts of attempted murder for repeatedly swinging the machete at the Walmart employee. Horton says multiple charges related to the other attacks will be brought against Brock when at his arraignment, which is scheduled for 3 p.m. Tuesday in Marion County Court.

Debra Clayton was gunned down in the line of duty on Jan. 9, 2017. (Orlando Police Dept.) ORLANDO, Fla. (MEDIA GENERAL) — A police officer shot and killed Monday morning in Orlando was a married mother who died protecting the community she loved, according to the Orlando Police Department’s chief of police, John Mina. Master Sgt. Debra Clayton passed away about an hour after she was shot outside a Walmart in a northwest neighborhood of the city. Chief Mina said Clayton, a 17-year veteran of the force, was extremely committed to Orlando’s youth. She had a “smile and a high-five for every kid she came across,” a tweet by the department stated. They later posted a picture of a smiling Clayton standing with two young boys with the caption “THIS is how we know and remember Sergeant Debra Clayton.” THIS is how we know and remember Sergeant Debra Clayton. She always had a smile for kids and always took a moment to interact w/community. pic.twitter.com/8zL46iyUe6 — Orlando Police (@OrlandoPolice) January 9, 2017 Chief Mina said Clayton also organized several marches against violence by herself. “Debra Clayon is a hero,” he declared. “She gave her life protecting the community that she loves. She will be deeply missed.” Master Sgt. Clayton was deeply committed to the community and to police work. pic.twitter.com/BBelv7Et1V — Orlando Police (@OrlandoPolice) January 9, 2017 The suspect in the shooting has been identified as Markeith Loyd.

Orange County sheriff deputies salute as the body of Orange County Sheriff's Office Deputy First Class Norman Lewis was transported from Orlando Regional Medical Center after the deputy was killed in the line of duty in Orlando, Fla., Monday, Jan. 9, 2017. An Orlando police sergeant was shot and killed Monday after approaching a suspect wanted for questioning in the murder of his pregnant ex-girlfriend, and Lewis was killed in a crash while responding to a manhunt for the suspect. (Joe Burbank / AP) By Mike Schneider Associated Press Twitter Facebook  Email  Reddit  SMS ORLANDO, Fla. – Law enforcement officers in Orlando were engaged in a massive manhunt early Tuesday for a man accused of fatally shooting a police officer who approached him outside a Wal-Mart. The manhunt itself has led to the death of a sheriff’s deputy in a traffic accident and the injury of another officer. Master Sgt. Debra Clayton, 42, was killed outside the Wal-Mart store in northwest Orlando early Monday, and Orange County Sheriff’s Office Deputy 1st Class Norman Lewis was killed more than two hours later in a crash while responding to a manhunt for Markeith Loyd, 41. Another Orlando police officer was involved in a crash while responding to the shooting but had only minor injuries. The deaths left Orlando’s law enforcement community in mourning. Clayton’s patrol SUV was displayed in front of Orlando police headquarters Tuesday morning. The police department also started an online fund to raise money for her family. Authorities said Loyd previously was a suspect in the killing of his pregnant ex-girlfriend in December. A massive manhunt involving hundreds of officers was conducted all day Monday as they searched for Loyd in dozens of homes, displacing some residents of a northwest Orlando apartment complex and tying up traffic. “He should be considered armed and dangerous,” Police Chief John Mina said. Later in the day, the chief said, “It doesn’t matter where he is. We will track him down to the ends of the Earth.” Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said deputies had been searching unsuccessfully for Loyd for several weeks since the fatal shooting of his ex-girlfriend and believe he was receiving help from someone. Mina lauded Clayton, a 17-year veteran of the force, as a committed officer and a hero who gave her life to the community she loves. The Orlando Police Department said in a tweet that Clayton always had a smile and a high five for every child she came across. Clayton had grown up in the Orlando area and was active in programs that mentored young people. “She was always the first to step up and help kids,” Mina said. Clayton was a supervisor for a patrol division in the neighborhood where she was shot, and she previously had worked in investigations and as a school resource officer, Deputy Chief Orlando Rolon said. “She made a point, even outside her working hours, to do things for youth and do things for the community,” Rolon said. She was married and had a college-age son. Police released a video of Clayton’s body being taken out of the hospital to a waiting van in a flag-covered stretcher. A line of officers saluted as the stretcher was wheeled out. The apartment complex that was the focus of the manhunt and shooting in northwest Orlando was nowhere near Orlando’s tourism corridor in the southern part of the metro area. Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer declared a day of mourning in the city. While at the Wal-Mart on Monday morning, Clayton was tipped off by someone that Loyd was in the area. When she approached him, he fired multiple shots at Clayton, who was wearing body armor, Mina said. Clayton returned fire but didn’t hit him, he said. Sheriff’s officials said a deputy spotted Loyd fleeing in a vehicle. The suspect pulled into a nearby apartment complex and then fired at a deputy, striking the deputy’s SUV twice. The deputy wasn’t harmed, the sheriff’s office said. Loyd then carjacked another vehicle, drove away and then abandoned the vehicle not far away, according to the sheriff’s office. The Orange County Sheriff’s Office deputy was killed more than two hours after the shooting when a van collided with his motorcycle as he responded to the manhunt. Demings described the 35-year-old Lewis as “a gentle giant,” and the sheriff’s office said he had played football for the University of Central Florida before joining the agency 11 years ago.

MUST WATCH Orlando police urge suspect to turn himself in 01:14 Story highlights The reward for information leading to Markeith Loyd's arrest increases to $100,000 Suspect had posted on Facebook he hoped to be on "America's Most Wanted" Orlando (CNN)The massive search for a man suspected of killing his pregnant girlfriend and gunning down an Orlando police officer has expanded beyond Florida, police said Tuesday. Markeith Loyd has been on the run since Monday morning when police say he killed Master Sgt. Debra Clayton as she tried to confront the murder suspect outside a Walmart. The manhunt for Loyd has already led to several injuries and the death of Orange County Sheriff's Deputy 1st Class Norman Lewis, who died in a motorcycle crash while searching for him. As hundreds of law enforcement officers scramble to find a man called "armed and extremely dangerous," here are the latest developments: Reward raised to $100,000 Read More Authorities increased the reward for information leading to Loyd's arrest to $100,000, Orlando police Chief John Mina said Tuesday. "The Orlando Police Department, the Orange County Sheriff's Office, the FBI, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, homeland security, the U.S. marshals -- everyone is working to capture him," he said earlier. Since yesterday @CrimelineFL has received more than 300 tips on Markeith Loyd. There has never been a reward this large. $100K pic.twitter.com/Q0T1zhvxiW— Orlando Police (@OrlandoPolice) January 10, 2017 "We believe that people who know where he is will want that money," he said. Suspect said he wanted to be on 'America's Most Wanted' Two weeks before Loyd was accused of killing his pregnant girlfriend, Sade Dixon, he posted a message on Facebook: "Goals!!!! To be on Americas most wanted". On Monday morning, Clayton received word that Loyd was near a local Walmart. She tried to confront him. "As soon as she said, 'Stop,' he basically opened fire on her," Mina said. A witness outside the Walmart described a similar scene. "I was walking down the sidewalk, right past the officer, and I heard her tell him to stop, or whatever, and he shot her," witness James Herman told CNN affiliate WFTV-TV in Orlando. "He shot her down." Fund established for officer's family Clayton was the mother of a college-age son, and Orlando police said many people have been asking how they can help. Already, however, some people have tried to profit from the officer's death. "Unfortunately, after tragic events like this, there are evil people out there who are looking to take advantage of our community, and there have already been two fake GoFundMe accounts," Mina said. He urged anyone wanting to donate to visit the verified GoFundMe page for Clayton's family. Many have asked how they can help. There's a fund for Master Sgt. Clayton's family. This is the ONLY official fund. https://t.co/QfjYmY3nrg pic.twitter.com/ih2RQxurhI— Orlando Police (@OrlandoPolice) January 10, 2017 Clayton was a first responder to Pulse massacre Orlando tragedy: Two officers remembered Clayton's death was the latest blow for the Orlando Police Department, which is still reeling from the June massacre at the Pulse nightclub that left 49 people dead. "Unfortunately we still have officers that are struggling with the Pulse tragedy," the police chief said. "It's been a tough seven or eight months for us." Clayton responded moments after the mass shooting at the club, police spokeswoman Michelle Guido said. "Like many of other officers here, she was a first responder that had to go to Pulse in the early morning hours to assist," Mina said. The pursuit Suspect Markeith Loyd After the shooting, Loyd fled in a car and fired shots at another officer, police said. That officer was not seriously injured. The suspect then abandoned the first vehicle and carjacked another one. He ditched that second vehicle shortly afterward and ran into an apartment complex, Mina said. It's unclear where he is now. But a "be on the lookout" alert has been sent nationwide, which is standard procedure with Florida murder suspects, said Guido, the police spokeswoman. "I believe there have been people out there helping him all along," Mina said. "If we find out about those people, we will criminally charge them." He said Loyd would be charged with first-degree murder of a law enforcement officer and attempted murder of the officer at whom he fired.

She was extremely committed to our youth and the community," the police chief said. "She did so many different projects in the community. She organized several marches against violence by herself." Lewis, the sheriff's deputy killed in the crash, was also known as "Big Norm," friends said. "'Big Norm' was known as much for his infectious ear-to-ear smile as he was his 6-foot-3, nearly 300-pound towering frame," Orlando attorney Brian Sandor said. "His smile and laugh took over any room he was in." That million dollar smile. The consummate professional. That's how we will remember our gentle giant DFC Norm Lewis.

Debra Clayton Monday, Jan. 9, 2017 ShareAdjustCommentPrint Schools were locked down, roads closed and two law enforcement officers died near Orlando, Florida, Monday, as a month-long hunt for a murder suspect closed in and turned violent. Accused of killing his pregnant ex-girlfriend last month, Markeith D. Loyd shot Sgt. Debra Clayton multiple times when she confronted him outside a Walmart near the Pine Hills area, police said. That wasn’t the end of the violence: A sheriff’s deputy was struck and killed by a sport-utility vehicle while responding to the shooting, and another deputy took fire while trying to stop Loyd’s presumed getaway vehicle. It is with heavy hearts we announce the death of beloved Deputy First Class Norman Lewis. The 11-year-veteran died in a crash today. #RIP pic.twitter.com/LX5zN7JzLx — OCSO FL News (@OrangeCoSheriff) January 9, 2017 Hours later-as hundreds of local, state and federal officers scoured streets and apartment blocks-Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings looked into a bank of TV cameras and urged Loyd to turn himself in. “Otherwise this is going to be a very, very risky operation for all of us,” he said. The mayhem began early in the morning – apparently when a 17-year police veteran went shopping at a Walmart in the Pine Hills area. A witness told ABC affiliate WFTV that Clayton, a married mother of two, was putting her bags in her trunk when a customer walked up and told her a wanted man was inside the store. Police had been looking for Loyd since Dec. 13, the day he allegedly shot and killed his pregnant ex-girlfriend and wounded her brother, according to the Orlando Sentinel. He was considered armed and dangerous, even then. Clayton turned back toward the Walmart just as the suspect walked out, James Herman told WFTV. “I heard her tell him: Stop,” Herman said. “He shot her down and he took off running.” The suspect fired backward as he ran, the witness said. Clayton was shot twice in the chest and once in the abdomen, WFTV reported. Her heart stopped in the ambulance on the way to the hospital. Paramedics briefly revived her, but a flag-covered gurney was later wheeled out of a hospital as police officers lined up to salute it. “Oh God!!!” Orlando commissioner Regina Hill wrote on Facebook. “Please pray for my OPD Liaison. She’s been shot down in Pinehills.” In the early scramble for the suspect, an Orange County sheriff’s deputy on a motorcycle was struck by a vehicle. “He squeezed my hand. His arm was going cold,” a witness who tried to save the deputy told WFTV. “I thought he was going to make it.” The deputy died of his injuries. His name was being withheld until his family is notified. Another deputy spotted a speeding vehicle that matched the description of Loyd’s, and made a U-turn to pursue it, Sheriff Jerry Demings said at a news conference. The driver opened fire, the sheriff said, hitting the deputy’s vehicle but not harming him. According to WFTV, Loyd allegedly carjacked a vehicle and escaped again. Large swaths of the Pine Hills area were cordoned off as officers hunted for Loyd. After several hours, the Orlando Sentinel reported that SWAT police had surrounded an apartment and were calling Loyd out – rifles ready and helicopters circling. “He will be brought to justice,” Orlando Police Chief John Mina told reporters at the news conference. “I can assure the community of that.” A hero remembered never dies. M/Sgt. Debra Clayton always had time to mentor our youth. pic.twitter.com/Vv6SEva31J — Chief John Mina (@ChiefJohnMina) January 10, 2017 But more hours passed with no sign of Loyd, as the searchers roved across the city. A reward for his capture was increased to US$60,000, and authorities warned that anyone helping him hide would be prosecuted. Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer declared an official day of mourning. Florida Gov. Rick Scott prayed. City officials and law enforcement officers wept openly in front of TV cameras. Clayton was one of the first officers who responded to the Pulse nightclub shooting in June, arriving minutes after 911 calls came in about shots fired, according to police records. The Orlando officer appears to be the first law enforcement official fatally shot this year. Her death comes after a year that saw a surge in the number of law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty, a toll pushed upward by an increase in deadly shootings and ambush attacks.

Clayton's patrol vehicle, and a wreath, outside OPD HQ. pic.twitter.com/TucGBeCYbG — Orlando Police (@OrlandoPolice) January 10, 2017 These shootings included high-profile attacks in Dallas and Baton Rouge that left a combined eight officers dead, ambushes that rattled law enforcement officers nationwide at a time of tension between police and the communities they serve. Although statistics show a steep drop in the number of line-of-duty deaths since the 1970s, officers and others in law enforcement have said in recent years that they are increasingly on edge amid protests against how police use deadly force and concerned about the public perception of police. Others have expressed concern about antigovernment attackers targeting law enforcement officers and the number of guns available on the streets. Last year, 65 police officers were killed in shootings, up from 41 the year before, according to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, a nonprofit group that monitors line-of-duty deaths. Gunfire was the common factor in nearly half of the 136 law enforcement deaths in 2016, according to the National Law Enforcement Memorial Fund, the highest percentage in more than two decades. Before 2016, it was more common in recent years for officers to die in traffic accidents than shootings. Ambushes were behind an unusually high share of these deaths, with nearly 1 in 3 officers fatally shot in such an attack. The surge in officers killed by gunfire last year was the largest on record, up 56 per cent over the previous year, according to data from the memorial fund.

Gallop, Florida Today Published 8:13 a.m. ET Jan. 10, 2017 | Updated 2:58 p.m. ET Jan. 10, 2017 Skip in Skip x Embed x Share A manhunt is on in Orlando for Markeith Lloyd after one officer is shot and another is killed in a motorcycle crash while chasing the suspect. Elizabeth Keatinge (@ekeatinge) has more. Buzz60 The Orlando Police Department issued a wanted poster for Markeith Loyd, 41, on Monday, Jan. 9, 2017. Loyd is wanted in connection with the murders of his pregnant ex-girlfriend and Orlando Master Sgt. Debra Clayton. (Photo: Orlando Police Department) MELBOURNE, Fla. — Authorities raised the reward for the whereabouts of a man accused of fatally shooting an Orlando police officer during a confrontation to $100,000 as the FBI placed the fugitive on its most wanted list. Orange County, Fla., officials also activated their emergency operations center as federal, state and local law enforcement agents come together to work on the case that has prompted a massive manhunt across central Florida. "We're using every tool to bring (the officer's) killer to justice," said Orlando Police Chief John Mina during a news conference Tuesday. Authorities say they are following numerous tips on Markeith Loyd, the 41-year-old suspected of shooting and killing Orlando Master Sgt. Debra Clayton during a violent confrontation at a Walmart parking lot. “Please continue to be vigilant and help us bring this killer to justice,” a spokesperson tweeted earlier for the Orlando Police Department. USA TODAY Manhunt underway after fatal shooting of Orlando officer The police department offered the $100,000 reward for any information leading to Loyd's location. He also is a suspect in last month's shooting death of his 24-year-old pregnant ex-girlfriend. Clayton’s slaying drew comments from the nation’s top prosecutor, U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch. Lynch said in a speech late Monday that a number of federal resources — including the FBI, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and the U.S. Marshals Service — have been committed to help Orlando police to locate Loyd. The reward for the capture of Markeith Loyd has been raised to $100,000. The manhunt is still active. pic.twitter.com/uTGIudUHfs— OCSO FL News (@OrangeCoSheriff) January 10, 2017 “These tragic deaths make clear the great risks that our brave men and women in uniform face each and every day, and the deep and abiding gratitude that our nation owes them for their service,” said Lynch, in a transcript of her speech at a human trafficking conference in Washington, D.C., late Monday. Lynch also talked about the dangers facing the nation’s law enforcement agents and the risks involved with policing. “As they are responding to events in their community, they are often the first on the scene of dangerous events — as we saw when they responded to the shootings at the Fort Lauderdale Airport last Friday, when five innocent people lost their lives to a gunman,” she said, referring to the incident which left five people dead and the suspected lone gunman in custody. “My thoughts and prayers — and those of my colleagues at the Department of Justice — are with the families and loved ones of those lost and wounded in these tragic events.” Master Sgt. Clayton's patrol vehicle, and a wreath, outside OPD HQ. pic.twitter.com/TucGBeCYbG— Orlando Police (@OrlandoPolice) January 10, 2017 Officers also held a wreath laying ceremony for Clayton — one of many tributes to take place this week as final memorial preparations get underway. The ceremony took place near Clayton’s patrol vehicle parked outside of police headquarters in downtown Orlando. A Gofundme site also was set up to raise funds for Clayton’s family. The fund, set up by officers at the agency, had an announced goal of $10,000 and had already raised more than $7,000 in pledges by Tuesday morning. Clayton was in a brief foot chase with Loyd on Monday at the Walmart when Loyd turned with his weapon and fired on her, said Orlando Police Chief John Mina during a news conference hours after the shooting. Clayton returned fire before collapsing from her injury. Loyd shot at another deputy and fled the area before other officers arrived. “The loss of our friend and hero to this community only strengthens our resolve to fight for justice,” Mina later tweeted after the news conference. Orange County (Fla.) Sheriff's Deputy Norman Lewis was killed in a traffic accident during a manhunt for Markeith Loyd on Monday, Jan. 9, 2017. Loyd is suspected of fatally shooting Orlando Master Sgt. Debra Clayton.  (Photo: Orange County (Fla.) Sheriff's Office) The officer’s shooting death prompted a massive manhunt by hundreds of law enforcement officers as armored vehicles and SWAT teams fanned out to the area near the Walmart retail center where the deadly shooting took place. Loyd’s photo was later plastered on wanted posters and distributed on social media. More than a dozen Orange County schools also were placed on lock down Monday. Compounding the tragedy was the death of another officer — Orange County (Fla.) Sheriff’s Deputy Norman Lewis, a motor patrolman who had joined the search for Clayton’s suspected killer. Lewis, an 11-year-veteran of the agency, was described as a "gentle giant" by the department. Officials in the Sheriff's Office described him as having a "million dollar smile" and being a "consummate professional," giving him the moniker "Big Norm." He was a University of Central Florida graduate who was an offensive lineman from 2000 to 2003. Florida Highway Patrol investigators said the deputy was on a motorcycle when the driver of a 2010 Honda van attempted to turn left and turned directly into the path of the motorcycle. The deputy was thrown from the bike and was pronounced dead, reports show. The manhunt for Loyd was conducted all day Monday as officers searched for him in dozens of homes, displacing some residents of a northwest Orlando apartment complex and tying up traffic. Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said deputies had been searching unsuccessfully for Loyd for several weeks since the fatal shooting of his ex-girlfriend and believe he was receiving help from someone.

(Stephen M. Dowell/ Orlando Sentinel/Associated Press) Related Stories 'He will be brought to justice': Orlando manhunt continues after police officer killed Law enforcement officers in Florida were engaged in a massive manhunt early Tuesday for a man accused of fatally shooting a police officer who approached him outside an Orlando Walmart. The manhunt itself has led to the death of a sheriff's deputy in a traffic accident and the injury of another officer. 'He should be considered armed and dangerous.' — Orlando Police Chief John Mina Master Sgt. Debra Clayton, 42, was killed outside the Walmart store in northwest Orlando early Monday, and Orange County Sheriff's Office Deputy 1st Class Norman Lewis was killed more than two hours later in a crash while responding to a manhunt for Markeith Loyd, 41. Another Orlando police officer was involved in a crash while responding to the shooting but had only minor injuries. Massive manhunt continues in Orlando As the third day of the manhunt for Loyd started Wednesday, authorities had raised the reward for information leading to his arrest from $60,000 US to $100,000. More than 300 tips from the public have been made, said Barb Bergin, executive director of Crimeline, the tip-line service which is offering the reward and warns in notices that Loyd is "armed and extremely dangerous." "We will not identify you. We just need to know where he is so no one else is hurt," Bergin said in a plea for more tips. The reward is now $100,000. Help us locate Markeith Loyd. Call 911 or @CrimelineFL at 800-423-TIPS pic.twitter.com/Odinqn5b09— @OrlandoPolice Authorities said Loyd previously was a suspect in the killing of his pregnant ex-girlfriend in December. A massive manhunt involving hundreds of officers was conducted all day Monday as they searched for Loyd in dozens of homes, displacing some residents of a northwest Orlando apartment complex and tying up traffic. "He should be considered armed and dangerous," Police Chief John Mina said. Later in the day, the chief said, "It doesn't matter where he is. We will track him down to the ends of the Earth." Suspect has extensive rap sheet Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said deputies had been searching unsuccessfully for Loyd for several weeks since the fatal shooting of his ex-girlfriend and believe he was receiving help from someone. Mina lauded Clayton, a 17-year veteran of the force, as a committed officer and a hero who gave her life to the community she loves. The Orlando Police Department said in a tweet that Clayton always had a smile and a high five for every child she came across. 'She was always the first to step up and help kids.' — Orlando Police Chief John Mina Clayton had grown up in the Orlando area and was active in programs that mentored young people. "She was always the first to step up and help kids," Mina said. Clayton was a supervisor for a patrol division in the neighbourhood where she was shot, and she previously had worked in investigations and as a school resource officer, Deputy Chief Orlando Rolon said. "She made a point, even outside her working hours, to do things for youth and do things for the community," Rolon said. She was married and had a college-age son. Master Sgt. Debra Clayton of the Orlando Police Department was shot near a local Walmart store early Monday. (Orlando Police Department/Twitter) Police released a video of Clayton's body being taken out of the hospital to a waiting van in a flag-covered stretcher. A line of officers saluted as the stretcher was wheeled out. The apartment complex that was the focus of the manhunt and shooting in northwest Orlando was nowhere near Orlando's tourism corridor in the southern part of the metro area. Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer declared a day of mourning in the city. Gunfire, carjacking While at the Walmart on Monday morning, Clayton was tipped off by someone that Loyd was in the area. When she approached him, he fired multiple shots at Clayton, who was wearing body armour, Mina said. Clayton returned fire but didn't hit him, he said. Law enforcement officers search an area for suspect Markeith Loyd. (John Raoux/Associated Press) Sheriff's officials said a deputy spotted Loyd fleeing in a vehicle. The suspect pulled into a nearby apartment complex and then fired at a deputy, striking the deputy's SUV twice. The deputy wasn't harmed, the sheriff's office said. Loyd then carjacked another vehicle, drove away and then abandoned the vehicle not far away, according to the sheriff's office. The Orange County Sheriff's Office deputy was killed more than two hours after the shooting when a van collided with his motorcycle as he responded to the manhunt. Demings described the 35-year-old Lewis as "a gentle giant," and the sheriff's office said he had played football for the University of Central Florida before joining the agency 11 years ago.  Loyd has a lengthy criminal record dating back two decades, authorities said. He was arrested in 1996 on a murder charge that was later dropped. Loyd was arrested for battery on an officer in 1998 and sentenced to more than four years in prison. While behind bars, he pleaded guilty to cocaine possession from a prior case and was transferred to federal prison. Federal records show he was released in July 2014. More recently, his wife whom he is in the process of divorcing, had filed a request for a temporary injunction against him in 2015, and he followed with a similar request against her three days later. Both requests were eventually dismissed in court. He also had paternity suits from three different women filed against him. His Facebook profile had videos of him working out at a gym and hanging out at a nightclub. He said in a November post, "Goals!!!! To be on Americas (sic) most wanted," followed by a series of laughing-with-tears emojis. © The Associated Press, 2017 Report Typo or Error Send Feedback Stay Connected with CBC News Mobile Facebook Podcasts Twitter Alerts Newsletter Latest Video Best presidential inauguration performances 3:50 'Trump does not have the moral authority to battle with John Lewis,' says Rev.

Graham For Dailymail.com Published: 09:54 EST, 10 January 2017 | Updated: 15:10 EST, 10 January 2017 e-mail 28 shares 1 View comments Markeith Loyd (right), 41, is the suspect accused in the shooting and police are still searching for him The second day of a massive manhunt is underway for a gunman who shot dead a veteran police officer outside of an Orlando Walmart after she approached the man who is suspected in the murder of his pregnant ex-girlfriend. Orlando police Chief John Mina said Markeith Loyd, 41, could also face more charges related to the death of Orange County Sheriff's Deputy Norman Lewis, who died in a motorcycle crash as he gave pursuit of Loyd following the shooting death of Master Sgt. Debra Thomas Clayton.    Mina said Clayton, 42, was shot dead after she spotted Loyd outside of a Pine Hills Walmart on Monday morning. While fleeing the scene, Loyd fired shots at a deputy's cruiser, police said. During the early hours of the manhunt for Loyd, Lewis, an 11-year veteran, was killed in a motorcycle crash after he was hit by a van while searching for the gunman. Mina stated that in addition to the charges he will face for Clayton's shooting death, Loyd could face charges of first-degree murder of a law enforcement officer in relation to Lewis' death, WESH reported.    'We will track him down to the ends of the earth,' Mina said during a press conference. Scroll down for video   Orlando Police Department Master Sgt. Debra Thomas Clayton (left) was shot dead outside of a Pine Hills Walmart store on Monday. During the early hours of the manhunt for Loyd, Orange County Sheriff's Deputy Norman Lewis (right)  was killed in a crash as authorities gave pursuit A boot lies on Pine Hills Road on Monday after Lewis, an 11-year veteran, was struck by a van while responding to the manhunt for Loyd Police Chief John Mina stated that Loyd could face charges of first-degree murder of a law enforcement officer in relation to Lewis' death (crash scene above) Clayton (above) was a 17-year veteran of the police department, a wife and a mother to a college-aged son. Mina said Clayton, 42, is a 'hero' 'Debra Clayton is a hero, and she gave her life to protect the community she loves,' Mina said. 'She will be deeply missed.' Clayton, who was one of the first officers to respond to the Pulse nightclub massacre on June 12, was married with a college-age son.  She is described by colleagues and those who knew her as a person who always gave back to the community and loved helping others.  A GoFundMe page has been created to raise funds for Clayton's funeral costs. In 17 hours, more than $16,600 has been donated towards the $20,000 goal.  Florida Gov. Rick Scott said he was 'heartbroken and angered' over the loss of lives. Lewis played college football and earned a bachelor's degree in criminal justice from the University of Central Florida.   Clayton's flag-draped coffin (above) was removed from Orlando Regional Medical Center and was provided a police escort from the hospital hours after her fatal shooting Clayton's patrol vehicle (above) is set to remain outside of OPD headquarters for now, Mina announced. A wreath has been placed next to it The Monday morning shooting happened just after 7.15am, as police say Clayton had been shopping in the store and was outside putting bags in the trunk of her car when someone told her that Loyd, a suspect wanted in connection with the December murder of his pregnant ex-girlfriend, may have been inside the store.  The 17-year veteran was heading back into the store alone and had radioed in at 7.17am 'to say that she was attempting to contact a murder suspect,' Mina said.  She told the suspect to 'stop', but he immediately fired multiple shots at her before fleeing the scene, authorities said. At 7.19am, officers radioed in to say Clayton had been shot and the first responding officers on scene began CPR on Clayton. She was pronounced dead at 7.40am at Orlando Regional Medical Center.  Loyd then carjacked a vehicle before getting out and running off, police said. Of Clayton (above left), Mina said: 'She gave her life to protect the community she loves.' He added that she was one of the first officers to respond to the Pulse nightclub massacre on June 12 Day two of a manhunt is underway for the gunman who is suspected of shooting dead Clayton near a Walmart early Monday morning (scene above) He is considered to be armed and dangerous and police are asking anyone who knows his whereabouts to please call 1-800-423-TIPS. Orlando police announced Monday afternoon that a reward of up to $60,000 is being offered for information leading to Loyd's arrest. 'We're going to bring this dirt-bag to justice, and he's going to jail,' Mina said of Loyd at the press conference on Monday. 'The community can be sure of that.'  James Herman, a witness to the shooting, told WFTV that the gunman was wearing a security uniform and fired at least 12 times at Clayton.    '(The shooter) was an average-looking dude, he walked by me, had a security vest and everything,' Herman said.  Florida Gov. Rick Scott bows his head and Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings, center, salutes as Lewis' body is transported from Orlando Regional Medical Center after the deputy was killed while responding to the Clayton's fatal shooting 'I was walking down the sidewalk, right past the officer, and I heard her tell him to stop, or whatever, and he shot her. He shot her down.'    Loyd is also wanted in connection with the December shooting death of his pregnant ex-girlfriend, Sade Dixon, 24 (above) Loyd was initially wanted in connection with the shooting death of Sade Dixon, a 24-year-old pregnant mother-of-two, who was shot dead just outside of her home on December 13. Authorities say Loyd, a convicted felon who has been arrested in Orange County 20 times since 1994, has been on the run since her death.  Dixon's brother, Ronald Steward, 26, was also shot and critically injured in the incident, as he was trying to help her, police said.  Loyd has served 10 years in prison and five years probation for conspiracy with intent to distribute cocaine, according to federal court records.  Back in 1999 he was sentenced to prison and was released from probation in 2014.  A November post on his Facebook page says: 'Goals!!!!

(Joe Burbank/Orlando Sentinel via AP) Related Coverage Slain Orlando officer was married mother, deeply committed to community Officer killed in Orlando, manhunt underway for suspect ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — Law enforcement officers in Orlando were engaged in a massive manhunt early Tuesday for a man accused of fatally shooting a police officer who approached him outside a Wal-Mart. The manhunt itself has led to the death of a sheriff’s deputy in a traffic accident and the injury of another officer. Master Sgt. Debra Clayton, 42, was killed outside the Wal-Mart store in northwest Orlando early Monday, and Orange County Sheriff’s Office Deputy 1st Class Norman Lewis was killed more than two hours later in a crash while responding to a manhunt for Markeith Loyd, 41. Another Orlando police officer was involved in a crash while responding to the shooting but had only minor injuries. The deaths left Orlando’s law enforcement community in mourning. Clayton’s patrol SUV was displayed in front of Orlando Police headquarters Tuesday morning. The police department also started an online fund to raise money for her family. In the Wal-Mart parking lot Tuesday morning, shoppers laid more than two dozen bouquets of flowers, teddy bears and candles in a makeshift memorial. Some shoppers, like Hal Shore, stopped to say a prayer or take a photo. “It’s important that the country is aware that there is a war against police officers,” said Shore, a cabinet maker. Authorities said Loyd previously was a suspect in the killing of his pregnant ex-girlfriend in December. A massive manhunt involving hundreds of officers was conducted all day Monday as they searched for Loyd in dozens of homes, displacing some residents of a northwest Orlando apartment complex and tying up traffic. “He should be considered armed and dangerous,” Police Chief John Mina said. Later in the day, the chief said, “It doesn’t matter where he is. We will track him down to the ends of the Earth.” Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said deputies had been searching unsuccessfully for Loyd for several weeks since the fatal shooting of his ex-girlfriend and believe he was receiving help from someone. Mina lauded Clayton, a 17-year veteran of the force, as a committed officer and a hero who gave her life to the community she loves. The Orlando Police Department said in a tweet that Clayton always had a smile and a high five for every child she came across. Clayton had grown up in the Orlando area and was active in programs that mentored young people. “She was always the first to step up and help kids,” Mina said. Clayton was a supervisor for a patrol division in the neighborhood where she was shot, and she previously had worked in investigations and as a school resource officer, Deputy Chief Orlando Rolon said. “She made a point, even outside her working hours, to do things for youth and do things for the community,” Rolon said. She was married and had a college-age son. Police released a video of Clayton’s body being taken out of the hospital to a waiting van in a flag-covered stretcher. A line of officers saluted as the stretcher was wheeled out. The apartment complex that was the focus of the manhunt and shooting in northwest Orlando was nowhere near Orlando’s tourism corridor in the southern part of the metro area. Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer declared a day of mourning in the city. While at the Wal-Mart on Monday morning, Clayton was tipped off by someone that Loyd was in the area. When she approached him, he fired multiple shots at Clayton, who returned fire but didn’t hit him. She was wearing body armor, but was hit multiple times. Sheriff’s officials said a deputy spotted Loyd fleeing in a vehicle. The suspect pulled into a nearby apartment complex and then fired at a deputy, striking the deputy’s SUV twice. The deputy wasn’t harmed, the sheriff’s office said. Loyd then carjacked another vehicle, drove away and then abandoned the vehicle not far away, according to the sheriff’s office. The Orange County Sheriff’s Office deputy was killed more than two hours after the shooting when a van collided with his motorcycle as he responded to the manhunt. Demings described the 35-year-old Lewis as “a gentle giant,” and the sheriff’s office said he had played football for the University of Central Florida before joining the agency 11 years ago.     Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Orlando police officer shot, killed; suspect still being sought By Rene Stutzman and Stephanie Allen Orlando Sentinel SentinelSource.com ORLANDO, Fla. — Hundreds of law enforcement officers are searching for a fugitive after two Orlando-area cops were killed Monday morning, one shot by the murder suspect who managed to get away and a second killed in a crash while officers and deputies scrambled to find him. By Monday evening, officers largely abandoned the apartment complex in northwest Orlando that was the focus of their search for much of the day, and suspect Markeith Loyd, 41, was still at large. “We are going to bring this dirtbag to justice, and he’s going to jail,” Orlando Police Chief John Mina said. Orlando Police Master Sgt. Debra Clayton was shot about 7:15 a.m. by a murder suspect after someone pointed out the suspect at a Wal-Mart and the officer gave chase on foot, the agency reported. A sheriff’s deputy identified as Norman Lewis, 35, was later killed in a crash with a 78-year-old driver. He had been with the sheriff’s office since 2005. The manhunt prompted the lockdown of more than a dozen schools and snarled traffic for hours. A $60,000 reward is being offered for anyone who has information to help capture Loyd, who was accused of murdering his pregnant girlfriend in December. Clayton, the first Orlando officer killed in the line of duty in a decade, was one of the first responders to the Pulse nightclub in June after a mass shooting. Mina called Clayton “a hero. She gave her life for the community she loves.” The Florida Department of Law Enforcement sent out an alert midday, describing Loyd as 6-foot-3, 230 pounds and having last been seen on Cinderlane Parkway, a road through Rosemont, a high-crime area. An Orlando SWAT team came and went and came back again to an apartment complex on that street. Early on, an officer on a bullhorn called the suspect by name and told him to come out. Overhead a law enforcement helicopter circled. The squad left and returned midafternoon — helicopter, too — and at least four armored vehicles rolled into position. “We have several hundred law enforcement officers from multiple agencies that are assisting us. ... We are reasonably certain that we have the suspect in the area,” said Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings. Shortly after 6 p.m., dozens of patrol cars and armored trucks left the area. A SWAT officer said they did not find Loyd. TaQueria Jones, a Wal-Mart cashier, said Clayton checked out at her register minutes before the shooting Monday morning. “We talked about family, we talked about God,” Jones said. While the suspect was still at large, the cashier and others planted flowers in a spot just feet from where Clayton was killed. “I’m going to be out here every day to straighten them up. Every day,” Jones said. Both Clayton and Lewis graduated from the University of Central Florida. Lewis’ friends said being a law enforcement officer was his passion and that he loved serving others. “We’re sad on this day for many reasons,” Demings said at a morning news conference at Orlando Regional Medical Center. “In my 36-year career, this is possibly one of the toughest days for me.” Loyd has a long criminal history and on Nov. 30 wrote this on his Facebook page: “Goals!!!! To be on Americas most wanted.” Both OPD and the Sheriff’s Office described him as armed and dangerous, and Demings asked anyone with information about his whereabouts to contact law enforcement immediately. Orange County Mayor Teresa Jacobs asked Orange County residents to simply stay indoors. “We need citizens to be diligent, we need them to be careful. ... If you don’t have to be out, don’t be out,” she said. Also at that morning news conference were Mina, Demings, Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer and Gov. Rick Scott, who happened to be in town for a business event but canceled it. The violence started at the Walmart just before sunrise when a citizen who knows Loyd and knew he was wanted spotted him and told Clayton, a 17-year department veteran and patrol officer, Mina said. She was on duty and wearing body armor, he said. She called dispatch, reporting that Loyd was at the store, spotted him and then there was a short chase, Mina said. She called out, “Stop,” Mina said, and he opened fire. She returned fire but did not hit him, the chief said. Backup officers arrived 28 seconds later, but Loyd was already gone, Mina said. The backup officers tried to save Clayton with CPR, according to the city, but she was pronounced dead at 7:40 a.m. at Orlando Regional Medical Center. A short distance away, a captain at the Orange County Sheriff’s Office who was in the area spotted Loyd near Pine Hills Road and North Lane, according to that department. Loyd pulled into an apartment complex and fired at least once at the deputy, who was in an unmarked SUV. The bullet missed him but hit his SUV, the agency reported. The suspect then carjacked a vehicle and fled. He abandoned that vehicle near Rosemont and Cinderlane Parkway. That prompted the manhunt and produced two law enforcement crashes. The fatal crash happened about 9:45 a.m. on Pine Hills Road. According to the Florida Highway Patrol, Lewis was on a motorcycle traveling south when he was struck by a van turning left onto Balboa Drive. The deputy plowed into the side of the van, was thrown from his motorcycle and killed, FHP reported. The driver of the van that collided with the motorcycle deputy who was killed is Billie Jarrard of Clermont, FHP reported. He faced possible charges. No one answered the phone Monday at his home. Records show Jarrard is a 78-year-old recent widower with no criminal history in Florida. Online court records in Lake County list one traffic offense, for failing to obey a traffic control device in 2000. Ten minutes after that crash and 200 yards away but also on Pine Hills Road, another law enforcement officer, Orange County Deputy Nelson Borjas, 46, of Orlando, was involved in a crash that sent him to the hospital with minor injuries, according to the highway patrol. Deputies had been on the lookout for Loyd for weeks because of a murder warrant: He is accused of killing his pregnant 24-year-old girlfriend, Sade Dixon, on Dec. 13 and wounding her 26-year-old brother, Ronald Steward. They were shot at a home on Long Peak Drive. Loyd served 10 years in prison and five years on probation for conspiracy with intent to distribute cocaine, according to federal court records. He was sentenced in 1999 and was released from probation in 2014, according to federal records. Shortly after Monday’s shooting, Orlando City Commissioner Regina Hill identified Clayton as her liaison with the Police Department. “Oh God!!!! Please pray for my OPD Liaison, she’s been shot down in Pinehills,” Hill wrote on Facebook. The last OPD officer killed in the line of duty was Al Gordon, who was shot during a robbery Oct. 4, 2007, the agency reported. Dyer declared Monday an official day of mourning and canceled a City Council meeting. U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said agents with the FBI, Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms and U.S. Marshals Office were helping in the search. At the Rosemont apartment complex surrounded by SWAT, Michael Ridenour, 40, said he heard the Sheriff’s Office helicopter overhead about 7:30 a.m. and went outside to see officers with rifles telling residents to stay indoors. “It’s scary,” he said. “I mean if he’s willing to shoot a police officer, he’s willing to shoot anybody.” Discuss Print Posted in Mcclatchy, National and World on Tuesday, January 10, 2017 8:00 am.

(Associated Press ) By Mike SchneiderThe Associated Press Terrance HarrisThe Associated Press Tues., Jan. 10, 2017 ORLANDO, FLA.—Authorities increased the reward for information leading to the arrest of a suspect in the fatal shooting of an Orlando police sergeant on Tuesday to $100,000. The suspect eluded hundreds of officers on the second day of a massive manhunt. Authorities advised that arrest warrants were being prepared for people who may have helped 41-year-old Markeith Loyd evade deputies in the past month as they searched for him for questioning in the murder of his pregnant ex-girlfriend in December. Master Sgt. Debra Clayton was fatally shot Monday morning after she approached Loyd in the parking lot of a Wal-Mart store in northwest Orlando. Many of her colleagues immediately joined the pursuit; among them was a sheriff’s deputy who died when he was thrown from his motorcycle in an accident. More than 300 tips from the public have been made, said Barb Bergin, executive director of Crimeline, the tip-line service which is offering the reward, originally set for $60,000. “We have never burned or harmed a tipster. They are kept anonymous,” Bergin said in a plea for more tips. “We will not identify you. We just need to know where he is so no one else is hurt.” Article Continued Below Orange County Sheriff’s Office deputies in metro Orlando had been looking for Loyd since his ex-girlfriend was murdered last December.

Master Sergeant Debra Clayton died after confronting and being shot by a suspected murderer, triggering a manhunt in which a county sheriff died in a motorcycle crash. Sergeant Debra Clayton, a mother of two, was fatally shot early Monday morning.  (City of Orlando /AFP/GETTY IMAGES)   Orlando Police confirmed that Clayton was one of the officers who responded to the shooting at Pulse nightclub in which 49 patrons were killed. Last June’s massacre in Orlando was the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Clayton, who was married and has a college-aged son, also was known for her mentoring of young people and her involvement in the community in which she had grown up. In the Wal-Mart parking lot Tuesday morning, shoppers laid more than two dozen bouquets of flowers, teddy bears and candles in a makeshift memorial. Some shoppers, like Hal Shore, stopped to say a prayer or take a photo. “It’s important that the country is aware that there is a war against police officers,” said Shore, a cabinet maker. An apartment complex that was the focus of the manhunt Monday afternoon didn’t appear to have any police searches going on Tuesday morning. Some front doors were boarded up from being kicked in Monday because residents weren’t home when authorities came knocking. “I’m confident he is gone,” said Ida Seck, a resident who had worked with Clayton in her job as a security officer at Universal Orlando Resort. “For things like this to happen, yeah I’m scared for safety and my son’s safety but really there is nothing you can do.” Court documents show Loyd’s criminal record goes back two decades. He was arrested in 1996 on a murder charge that was later dropped. Loyd was arrested for battery on an officer in 1998 and sentenced to more than four years in prison. While behind bars, he pleaded guilty to cocaine possession from a prior case and was transferred to federal prison before being released in July 2014, according to federal records. More recently, his wife whom he is in the process of divorcing, had filed a request for a temporary injunction against him in 2015, and he followed with a similar request against her three days later. Both requests were eventually dismissed in court. He also had paternity suits from three different women filed against him. His Facebook profile had videos of him working out at a gym and hanging out at a nightclub. He said in a November post, “Goals!!!! To be on Americas (sic) most wanted,” followed by a series of laughing-with-tears emojis. An Orange County Sheriff’s Office deputy was killed more than two hours after Monday’s shooting when a van collided with his motorcycle as he responded to the manhunt. Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings described the 35-year-old Norman Lewis as “a gentle giant,” and the sheriff’s office said he had played football for the University of Central Florida before joining the agency 11 years ago.

Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings described the 35-year-old Norman Lewis as "a gentle giant," and the sheriff's office said he had played football for the University of Central Florida before joining the agency 11 years ago. Funerals were planned for Lewis for Friday and Clayton for Saturday. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

An Orlando police sergeant was shot and killed Monday after approaching a suspect wanted for questioning in the murder of his pregnant ex-girlfriend, and Lewis was killed in a crash while responding to a manhunt for the suspect. (Joe Burbank/Orlando Sentinel via AP) ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — Law enforcement officers in Orlando were engaged in a massive manhunt early Tuesday for a man accused of fatally shooting a police officer who approached him outside a Wal-Mart. The manhunt itself has led to the death of a sheriff’s deputy in a traffic accident and the injury of another officer. Master Sgt. Debra Clayton, 42, was killed outside the Wal-Mart store in northwest Orlando early Monday, and Orange County Sheriff’s Office Deputy 1st Class Norman Lewis was killed more than two hours later in a crash while responding to a manhunt for Markeith Loyd, 41. Another Orlando police officer was involved in a crash while responding to the shooting but had only minor injuries. Authorities said Loyd previously was a suspect in the killing of his pregnant ex-girlfriend in December. A massive manhunt involving hundreds of officers was conducted all day Monday as they searched for Loyd in dozens of homes, displacing some residents of a northwest Orlando apartment complex and tying up traffic. “He should be considered armed and dangerous,” Police Chief John Mina said. Later in the day, the chief said, “It doesn’t matter where he is. We will track him down to the ends of the Earth.” Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said deputies had been searching unsuccessfully for Loyd for several weeks since the fatal shooting of his ex-girlfriend and believe he was receiving help from someone. Mina lauded Clayton, a 17-year veteran of the force, as a committed officer and a hero who gave her life to the community she loves. The Orlando Police Department said in a tweet that Clayton always had a smile and a high five for every child she came across. Clayton had grown up in the Orlando area and was active in programs that mentored young people. “She was always the first to step up and help kids,” Mina said. Clayton was a supervisor for a patrol division in the neighborhood where she was shot, and she previously had worked in investigations and as a school resource officer, Deputy Chief Orlando Rolon said. “She made a point, even outside her working hours, to do things for youth and do things for the community,” Rolon said. She was married and had a college-age son. Police released a video of Clayton’s body being taken out of the hospital to a waiting van in a flag-covered stretcher. A line of officers saluted as the stretcher was wheeled out. The apartment complex that was the focus of the manhunt and shooting in northwest Orlando was nowhere near Orlando’s tourism corridor in the southern part of the metro area. Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer declared a day of mourning in the city. While at the Wal-Mart on Monday morning, Clayton was tipped off by someone that Loyd was in the area. When she approached him, he fired multiple shots at Clayton, who was wearing body armor, Mina said. Clayton returned fire but didn’t hit him, he said. Sheriff’s officials said a deputy spotted Loyd fleeing in a vehicle. The suspect pulled into a nearby apartment complex and then fired at a deputy, striking the deputy’s SUV twice. The deputy wasn’t harmed, the sheriff’s office said. Loyd then carjacked another vehicle, drove away and then abandoned the vehicle not far away, according to the sheriff’s office. The Orange County Sheriff’s Office deputy was killed more than two hours after the shooting when a van collided with his motorcycle as he responded to the manhunt. Demings described the 35-year-old Lewis as “a gentle giant,” and the sheriff’s office said he had played football for the University of Central Florida before joining the agency 11 years ago.

They now have a $73.85 price target on the stock. 12/6/2016 – Wal-Mart Stores was upgraded by analysts at Zacks Investment Research from a “sell” rating to a “hold” rating. According to Zacks, “Though the company is facing a number of headwinds, estimates and share price of Wal-Mart has been rising since the company reported its third-quarter fiscal 2017 results. Wal-Mart posted positive earnings streak for the fifth consecutive quarter, but top-line marginally fell short of expectations after surpassing the same in the preceding two quarters, possibly due to deflationary pressure hurting comparable store sales. We also noted that while total revenues increased slightly, earnings per share declined year over year, as unfavorable currency and higher investments in wages and e-commerce activities took a toll on the results. Nevertheless, Wal-Mart is focused on its building its e-commerce capabilities, foraying into new markets, expanding product assortments and implementing innovative ways to drive traffic.” 11/29/2016 – Wal-Mart Stores was upgraded by analysts at Zacks Investment Research from a “sell” rating to a “hold” rating. According to Zacks, “Estimates have been revised downward as Wal-Mart’s third quarter fiscal 2017 top-line marginally fell short of expectations after surpassing the same in the preceding two quarters.  Though total revenues increased slightly, earnings per share declined year over year but came within the company’s guided range. The company has narrowed its fiscal 2017 guidance to reflect the impact of the gain from the sale of Yihaodian in China. Decline in international revenues has been a major concern for Wal-Mart for quite some time now. Moreover, stiff competition from both brick & mortar and online retailers, and foreign currency headwinds pose as concerns. Nevertheless, Wal-Mart is aggressively expanding its E-commerce platform, foraying into new markets, expanding product assortments and implementing innovative ways to drive traffic.” 11/22/2016 – Wal-Mart Stores was downgraded by analysts at Zacks Investment Research from a “hold” rating to a “sell” rating. According to Zacks, “Wal-Mart reported mixed quarterly numbers for third-quarter fiscal 2017, wherein earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate while revenues missed the same. The top line succumbed to a negative surprise after beating estimates in the trailing two quarters. Decline in international revenues has been  a major concern for Wal-Mart for quite some time now. In the first and second quarters of fiscal 2017, international revenues declined 7.2% and 6.6%, respectively. In third-quarter fiscal 2017, segment net sales, including fuel sales, dropped 4.8% year over year to $28.4 billion. Nevertheless, Wal-Mart is focused on its building its e-commerce capabilities, as evident from its recent deal with JD.com in China. In fact, Wal-Mart is aggressively foraying into e-commerce in China with an aim to deliver goods from its stores around the world to Chinese consumers within hours. The Jet.com acquisition in the U.S. also fuelled growth.” 11/21/2016 – Wal-Mart Stores was given a new $81.00 price target on by analysts at Nomura. They now have a “buy” rating on the stock. 11/19/2016 – Wal-Mart Stores had its “underperform” rating reaffirmed by analysts at BMO Capital Markets.

Police accuse 2 of helping fugitive before officer's killing World by Mike Schneider, The Associated Press Posted Jan 10, 2017 4:12 am MST Last Updated Jan 12, 2017 at 8:40 am MST Sarah Harvey says a prayer at a makeshift memorial, Tuesday, Jan. 10, 2017, in Orlando, Fla., at the parking lot of a Wal-Mart where Orlando police officer Debra Clayton was shot and killed. A manhunt continues as law enforcement officials search for the suspect. (AP Photo/John Raoux) ORLANDO, Fla. – Police leading a massive manhunt for the suspected killer of an Orlando officer on Wednesday collected hundreds of tips and announced the arrests of two people who allegedly aided the fugitive, promising to reward anyone who turns him in, and punish anyone who helps him hide. Court records show that Markeith Loyd’s niece, 27-year-old Lakensha Smith-Loyd, was arrested on an accessory charge Wednesday, a day after the fugitive’s supervisor at a fried chicken restaurant, Zarghee Mayan, was arrested on the same charge. Mayan’s arrest affidavit said Smith-Loyd collected money from him to give to her uncle in the days after the slaying of his ex-girlfriend in mid-December. Smith-Loyd’s affidavit says she contacted deputies after the ex-girlfriend’s murder and promised to help them find her uncle if they first told her whether a firearm had been recovered from the murder scene. Then she stopped co-operating even as she contacted others on her uncle’s behalf, the affidavit said. Mayan is accused of supplying restaurant food to his former co-worker, driving him around and offering him money, despite knowing he was wanted in the slaying his pregnant ex-girlfriend, the affidavit said. “Mayan did so with the intent that Markeith Demangzlo Loyd avoid or escape detection, arrest, trial or punishment,” the arrest affidavit said. Mayan told authorities his most recent encounter with Loyd was last Saturday, two days before Master Sgt. Debra Clayton was fatally shot in a Wal-Mart parking lot. Mayan said he noticed that Loyd was armed and wearing body armour when they embraced, according to his arrest affidavit. During another encounter, right after Loyd’s ex-girlfriend was killed in mid-December, Mayan said Loyd came into the restaurant with a gun, pointed at Mayan and said, “‘Drive me or I will kill you, I just did something real bad,'” the affidavit said. Mayan said he drove Loyd to several locations, including the home of Loyd’s estranged wife, where Loyd told him to knock on the door. Mayan said he only walked to the door without knocking because he was afraid Lloyd would shoot her, according to the affidavit, which noted that Mayan told conflicting stories about his encounters with Loyd. The 41-year-old ex-convict has been the focus of a massive manhunt involving hundreds of officers and deputies since Monday’s shooting. More than 500 tips have come in from the public, which authorities believe may be particularly important, since others may be helping him hide. “If you know where he is at and you call us 3 o’clock in the morning, 3 o’clock in the afternoon, we will have people prepared to dispatch and go capture him,” said Barb Bergin, executive director of the local Crimeline. Orlando Police Chief John Mina, meanwhile has warned that anyone helping Loyd “will be put behind bars and brought to justice as well.” Mayan, 33, was arrested Tuesday by Orange County Sheriff’s Office deputies on a charge of accessory after the fact. Jail records show no bond had been set, and court records showed no name of a defence attorney listed for him. Mina said federal, state and local authorities were taking part in the manhunt. Mina wouldn’t give details about search tactics but he said law enforcement agencies in Florida and around the nation are on alert. “There are many things going on behind the scenes that our community is not aware of and that we are not at liberty to discuss,” Mina said. After Clayton was shot, many of her colleagues immediately joined the pursuit; among them was a sheriff’s Deputy First Class Norman Lewis, who died when he was thrown from his motorcycle in an accident.

The manhunt itself has led to the death of a sheriff’s deputy in a traffic accident and the injury of another officer. Story continues below Master Sgt. Debra Clayton, 42, was killed outside the Walmart store in northwest Orlando early Monday, and Orange County Sheriff’s Office Deputy 1st Class Norman Lewis was killed more than two hours later in a crash while responding to a manhunt for Markeith Loyd, 41. Another Orlando police officer was involved in a crash while responding to the shooting but had only minor injuries. READ MORE: Police hunt for suspect after Orlando cop fatally shot outside a Walmart Authorities said Loyd previously was a suspect in the killing of his pregnant ex-girlfriend in December. A massive manhunt involving hundreds of officers was conducted all day Monday as they searched for Loyd in dozens of homes, displacing some residents of a northwest Orlando apartment complex and tying up traffic. “He should be considered armed and dangerous,” Police Chief John Mina said. Later in the day, the chief said, “It doesn’t matter where he is. We will track him down to the ends of the Earth.” Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said deputies had been searching unsuccessfully for Loyd for several weeks since the fatal shooting of his ex-girlfriend and believe he was receiving help from someone. Mina lauded Clayton, a 17-year veteran of the force, as a committed officer and a hero who gave her life to the community she loves. The Orlando Police Department said in a tweet that Clayton always had a smile and a high five for every child she came across. WATCH: ‘I don’t think he deserves to live’: cousin of slain Orlando cop speaks out Clayton had grown up in the Orlando area and was active in programs that mentored young people. “She was always the first to step up and help kids,” Mina said. Clayton was a supervisor for a patrol division in the neighbourhood where she was shot, and she previously had worked in investigations and as a school resource officer, Deputy Chief Orlando Rolon said. “She made a point, even outside her working hours, to do things for youth and do things for the community,” Rolon said. She was married and had a college-age son. The Orlando Police Department family is heartbroken today. One of our own was taken in the line of duty.

A line of officers saluted as the stretcher was wheeled out. The apartment complex that was the focus of the manhunt and shooting in northwest Orlando was nowhere near Orlando’s tourism corridor in the southern part of the metro area. Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer declared a day of mourning in the city. While at the Wal-Mart on Monday morning, Clayton was tipped off by someone that Loyd was in the area. When she approached him, he fired multiple shots at Clayton, who was wearing body armour, Mina said. Clayton returned fire but didn’t hit him, he said. WATCH: Orlando police are searching for a 41-year-old suspect after he opened fire and fatally shot a police officer outside a Walmart Monday.  Sheriff’s officials said a deputy spotted Loyd fleeing in a vehicle. The suspect pulled into a nearby apartment complex and then fired at a deputy, striking the deputy’s SUV twice. The deputy wasn’t harmed, the sheriff’s office said. Loyd then carjacked another vehicle, drove away and then abandoned the vehicle not far away, according to the sheriff’s office. The Orange County Sheriff’s Office deputy was killed more than two hours after the shooting when a van collided with his motorcycle as he responded to the manhunt. Demings described the 35-year-old Lewis as “a gentle giant,” and the sheriff’s office said he had played football for the University of Central Florida before joining the agency 11 years ago. © 2017 The Canadian Press Report an error Debra Clayton Markeith Loyd Norman Lewis Orange County Sheriff's Office Orlando Orlando Police Department Orlando police shooting Police Shooting Walmart police shooting Editor's Picks Canada Fake news: A real-life Cruella de Vil didn't skin dozens of Texas cats Canada Why Justin Trudeau’s trip to the Aga Khan’s island matters Consumer No, you do not have to pay a 'settlement fee' if you get an illegal download notice Health Trump's support for anti-vaxxers could lead to deadly outbreaks, disease expert warns Canada Why is Canada's top diplomat, Chrystia Freeland, banned from Russia?

Now it thinks it can teach old-school retailers a thing or two about real-world commerce. The online juggernaut that vanquished EBay and Amazon in China has set its sights on transforming the byzantine world of brick-and-mortar retail. In its biggest old-economy deal so far,  Alibaba is leading a bid to buy out department store chain Intime Retail Group Co. for as much as $2.6 billion. That’s a premium for the privilege of owning a company with shrinking revenues and a minuscule footprint beyond its eastern home region. QuickTake Alibaba Jack Ma Photographer: Anthony Kwan/Bloomberg But by teaming up with retailers, billionaire founder Jack Ma hopes to develop a new model of online and offline retail. The idea is that Alibaba’s superior computing power, a decade of experience moving billions of dollars of goods and strong ties with government and big brands will help it succeed where others like Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and even Amazon.com Inc. have failed. If it works, the tie-up may open the door to still more, helping Alibaba both extend its logistics network and gain invaluable consumer data. “No one has any solution or concrete answer, although everyone knows that this is the next page of the industry. Alibaba wants to be the one to develop the solution,” said Anson Chan, a Hong-Kong based Daiwa Capital Markets analyst. History has shown that online and offline businesses don’t play well together. Wal-Mart spent billions of dollars on growing its e-commerce operation at the expense of profits, yet Amazon still holds sway in the U.S. Amazon itself is now venturing into brick-and-mortar stores though that effort is still nascent. Alibaba however is dealing with a very different market, and is driven by a need to secure new sources of growth as e-commerce plateaus. Ma himself has confessed he sees “tremendous challenges” for one-dimensional e-commerce operators as the country’s economy slows. His goal is to try and up-end a splintered and bloated $4.5 trillion Chinese retail landscape, stripping out middlemen to reduce costs and improve efficiency. Apart from Intime, Alibaba has also bought into electronics players Suning Commerce Group Co. and Haier Electronics Group. Alibaba shares rose 2.1 percent in U.S. trading after the deal was announced, while Intime’s stock surged 36 percent in Hong Kong. Read more: Alibaba’s consumer focus is just in time Chinese retailers could use some help. They’ve struggled in past years to retain consumers frustrated with lackluster, poorly managed malls. Unlike in the U.S., which is controlled by a clutch of mega-chains, the Chinese retail experience is far more fragmented and inconsistent. Intime, one of the better-known players, operated and managed just 29 department stores and 17 shopping malls across the country as of end-June last year, mainly in eastern Zhejiang province. That’s a far cry from the U.S., where nationwide chains such as Wal-Mart and Macy’s Inc. dominate specific strata. More important than geographical reach however is simple store management. While Wal-Mart and Amazon’s logistical machines inspire college case studies, most Chinese retailers still operate in separate, walled-off regions. Management lacks incentive to innovate. Alibaba sees an opportunity in helping such retailers use technology to transform inventory management, while securing a physical network through which it can get goods to its own customers more efficiently, for instance by letting customers pick up orders from stores. “Physical retail in China is backwards compared to elsewhere,” said Catherine Lim, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence in Singapore. “It’s going to be a root-and-branch effort to get the offline side up to standard, and that’s probably why Alibaba felt the need to take it over totally.” Lim cites a familiar example: You have to wait days to find out if there’s a size 10 dress in another branch of the same store. “The players have started to modernize, but it’s been very slow. The truth is that the technology and software is there, it’s whether the people were willing to adapt to it.” The logic of the Intime deal isn’t apparent to all. Alibaba may be counting on success in reviving the mall operator to encourage other retailers to adopt its online-to-offline or O2O model, Chan said. “What’s possible is that Alibaba wants to develop the O2O model and system through this partnership and, once it’s perfected, open up that system for others to use as a platform, like its cloud business,” Chan said. Also, neither Alibaba nor Intime own a lot of the inventory they sell -- Intime operates much like a bazaar where different brands run concessions. That means brands will need to be won over. “There is still the missing piece of the people who actually sell the items,” said Chan Wai-Chan, a Hong-Kong based senior partner at Oliver Wyman’s Asia Pacific consumer practice. “Intime is only in Zhejiang, so there won’t be a national reach. Maybe in the grand plan, Alibaba will buy other department stores, since sales of department stores have fallen through the floor.” But Alibaba’s certainly giving it a go. It’s already building a network that will allow physical stores -- and the brands they sell -- to monitor transactions as they happen.

AP By MIKE SCHNEIDER Tuesday, January 10, 2017 06:21AM ORLANDO, FL -- Orlando's law enforcement community is mourning the fatal shooting of an Orlando Police Department sergeant who was killed as she approached a fugitive outside a Wal-Mart store and an Orange County Sheriff's Office deputy who died in a traffic accident more than two hours later while responding to a manhunt for the suspect in the officer's slaying. Master Sgt. Debra Clayton, 42, was killed outside a Wal-Mart store in northwest Orlando early Monday, and Orange County Sheriff's Office Deputy First Class Norman Lewis was killed in a crash while responding to a manhunt for 41-year-old Markeith Loyd. Another Orlando police officer was involved in a crash while responding to the shooting but had only minor injuries. Authorities said Loyd previously was a suspect in the killing of his pregnant ex-girlfriend in December. A massive manhunt involving hundreds of officers was conducted all day Monday as they searched for Loyd in dozens of homes, displacing some residents of a northwest Orlando apartment complex and tying up traffic. "He should be considered armed and dangerous," Police Chief John Mina said. Later in the day, the chief said, "It doesn't matter where he is. We will track him down to the ends of the Earth." Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said deputies had been searching unsuccessfully for Loyd for several weeks since the fatal shooting of his ex-girlfriend and believe he was receiving help from someone. Mina lauded Clayton, a 17-year veteran of the force as a committed officer and a hero who gave her life to the community she loves. The Orlando Police Department said in a tweet that Clayton always had a smile and a high five for every child she came across. Clayton had grown up in the Orlando area and was active in programs that mentored young people. "She was always the first to step up and help kids," Mina said. Clayton was a supervisor for a patrol division in the neighborhood where she was shot, and she previously had worked in investigations and as a school resource officer, Deputy Chief Orlando Rolon said. "She made a point, even outside her working hours, to do things for youth and do things for the community," Rolon said. She was married and had a college-aged son. Police released a video of Clayton's body being taken out of the hospital to a waiting van in a flag-covered stretcher. A line of officers saluted as the stretcher was wheeled out. The apartment complex that was the focus of the manhunt and shooting in northwest Orlando was nowhere near Orlando's tourism corridor in the southern part of the metro area. Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer declared a day of mourning in the city. While at the Wal-Mart on Monday morning, Clayton was tipped off by someone that Loyd was in the area. When she approached him, he fired multiple shots at Clayton, who was wearing body armor, Mina said. Clayton returned fire but didn't hit him, he said. Sheriff's officials said a deputy spotted Loyd fleeing in a vehicle. The suspect pulled into a nearby apartment complex and then fired at a deputy, striking the deputy's SUV twice. The deputy wasn't harmed, the sheriff's office said. Loyd then carjacked another vehicle, drove away and then abandoned the vehicle not far away, according to the sheriff's office. The Orange County Sheriff's Office deputy was killed more than two hours after the shooting when a van collided with his motorcycle as he responded to the manhunt. Demings described the 35-year-old Lewis as "a gentle giant," and the sheriff's office said he had played football for the University of Central Florida before joining the agency 11 years ago.

(Joe Burbank/Orlando Sentinel) Rene Stutzman and Stephanie Allen Contact Reporters Hundreds of law enforcement officers are searching overnight for a fugitive who is accused of killing a cop at dawn on Monday when she tried to chase him down at a Wal-Mart and arrest him. A second law-enforcement official died in a crash just hours later as officers and deputies scrambled to find the murder suspect.  By Monday evening, officers largely abandoned the apartment complex in northwest Orlando that was the focus of their search for much of the day, and Markeith Loyd, 41, was still at large. "We are going to bring this dirtbag to justice, and he's going to jail," Orlando Police Chief John Mina said. Loyd has been wanted for murder since his pregnant ex-girlfriend was shot at her front door on Dec. 13. He has a long criminal history and on Nov. 30 wrote on his Facebook page: "Goals!!!! To be on Americas most wanted." Markeith Loyd Orange County Sheriff's Office Markeith Loyd Markeith Loyd (Orange County Sheriff's Office) The manhunt prompted the lockdown of more than a dozen schools and snarled traffic for hours. “If you don’t have to be out, don’t be out,” Orange County Mayor Teresa Jacobs said Monday morning. A $60,000 reward was offered for information leading to Loyd’s capture, and both Orlando police and the Sheriff's Office described him as armed and dangerous. The violence started about 7:15 a.m. at the Wal-Mart at John Young Parkway and Princeton Street, when someone spotted Loyd, knew he was wanted for murder and told Orlando police Master Sgt. Debra Clayton, who also happened to be at the store. She was on the job, in uniform and wearing body armor, Mina said. She called dispatch, then started chasing after Loyd. OPD officer shot and killed; deputy dies in crash Orlando Police Department Debra Clayton Debra Clayton (Orlando Police Department) She yelled for him to “stop” but instead the felon opened fire. She shot back but didn’t hit him, Mina said.  Backup officers who arrived 28 seconds later tried to save Clayton with CPR, according to the city, but she was pronounced dead at 7:40 a.m. at Orlando Regional Medical Center. A short distance from the Wal-Mart, a captain at the Orange County Sheriff's Office spotted Loyd near Pine Hills Road and North Lane, according to that department. Loyd pulled into an apartment complex and fired at least once at the deputy, who was in an unmarked SUV. The bullet missed him but hit his SUV. The suspect then carjacked a vehicle and fled. He abandoned that vehicle near Cinderlane Parkway, officials said. A massive manhunt for Loyd resulted in two motorcycle crashes by Orange County deputies, one fatal.        Deputy Norman Lewis, 35, an 11-year Sheriff’s Office veteran and former football player at the University of Central Florida, was killed 2-1/2 hours after the shooting. He was traveling south on Pine Hills Road on his motorcycle when he was struck by a van turning left onto Balboa Drive, the Florida Highway Patrol said. “We’re sad on this day for many reasons," Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said at a morning news conference at the hospital. "In my 36-year career, this is possibly one of the toughest days for me." The driver of the van, Billie Jarrard of Clermont, could possibly face charges in the crash, troopers said. No one answered the phone Monday at Jarrard’s home. Records show he is a 78-year-old recent widower with no criminal history in Florida.  Ten minutes after Lewis’ crash, another deputy was involved in a wreck that sent him to the hospital. It happened just 200 yards down Pine Hills Road. Orange County Deputy Nelson Borjas, 46, had minor injuries and is expected to recover.  Officer called a hero Clayton is the first Orlando officer killed in the line of duty in a decade. The last was Al Gordon, who was shot during a robbery Oct. 4, 2007, the agency reported. Clayton, who is survived by a husband and college-age son, was one of the first officers to respond to the mass shooting at the Pulse nightclub in June that left 49 people dead and scores injured. PICTURE GALLERY: An Orlando police officer was shot on Princeton Street, just west of John Young Parkway. An Orange County deputy died in a traffic crash during the manhunt for the suspect. Mina called her a hero. “She gave her life for the community she loves." TaQueria Jones, a Wal-Mart cashier, said Clayton checked out at her register minutes before the shooting. “We talked about family, we talked about God," Jones said.  While the suspect was still at large, the cashier and others planted flowers in a spot just feet from where Clayton was killed. “I’m going to be out here every day to straighten them up. Every day," Jones vowed. Lewis, who had been with the Sheriff's Office since March 2005, was a member of the motors/DUI unit. Both Lewis and Clayton had degrees from the University of Central Florida. “They are heroes and Knights forever," UCF President John Hitt said. Deputies had been on the lookout for Loyd for weeks because of a murder warrant: He's accused of murdering his pregnant 24-year-old ex-girlfriend, Sade Dixon, on Dec. 13 and wounding her 26-year-old brother, Ronald Steward. They were shot at an Orange County home on Long Peak Drive.

(Joe Burbank/Orlando Sentinel) Loyd has a long criminal record and served 10 years in prison and five years on probation for conspiracy with intent to distribute cocaine, according to federal court records.  "To lose two law enforcement officers on this Law Enforcement Appreciation Day is indeed a tragedy,” Demings said. ... “It's a reminder that law enforcement officers put their lives on the line every single day to protect all of us." Gov. Rick Scott was in Orlando on Monday for a business meeting, but that was canceled and he joined Mina, Demings and other local officials at a morning news conference. "It breaks my heart that one of them was already senselessly killed this morning,” Scott said. Apartments focus of search On Monday, officers searched dozens of apartments, single-family homes and vehicles in the Rosemont neighborhood. Much of the search focused on the Eagle Reserve apartment complex.  An Orlando SWAT team as well as armored vehicles and a helicopter came and went twice to the complex on Cinderlane Parkway, where Loyd was last spotted by law enforcement Monday morning after the shooting. They pulled out for the second time about 6 p.m., but only after leaving some residents barred from their homes or from getting to work for several hours. Lupe Garcia and her 9-year-old son, Migul Hidalgo, were stuck outside their home for most of the day. Garcia walked to drop him off at school and came back to find her home surrounded in crime scene tape with dozens of officers holding long guns. "It's scary," she said before she was let back into the complex. After she picked her son up, they waited with dozens of others outside the complex. Migul said as he and his mom were waiting, an Orange County deputy flagged him down and asked if he was hungry. The deputy pulled out a chocolate protein bar and gave it to the boy.

(Stephen M. Dowell/Orlando Sentinel via AP) ORLANDO, Fla. — Orlando’s law enforcement community is mourning the fatal shooting of an Orlando Police Department sergeant who was killed as she approached a fugitive outside a Wal-Mart store and an Orange County Sheriff’s Office deputy who died in a traffic accident more than two hours later while responding to a manhunt for the suspect in the officer’s slaying. Master Sgt. Debra Clayton, 42, was killed outside a Wal-Mart store in northwest Orlando early Jan. 9, and Orange County Sheriff’s Office Deputy First Class Norman Lewis was killed in a crash while responding to a manhunt for 41-year-old Markeith Loyd.

Debra Clayton shot outside Walmart By HOLLY YAN AND NICK VALENCIA , CNN Published 01/10 2017 04:02PM Updated 01/10 2017 04:48AM Master Sgt. Debra Clayton's death marks the first gun-related police fatality of 2017 in the United States. Clayton, 42, was shot to death. ORLANDO (CNN) The massive search for a man suspected of killing his pregnant girlfriend and gunning down an Orlando police officer has expanded beyond Florida, police said Tuesday. Markeith Loyd has been on the run since Monday morning when police say he killed Master Sgt. Debra Clayton as she tried to confront the murder suspect outside a Walmart. The manhunt for Loyd has already led to several injuries and the death of Orange County Sheriff's Deputy 1st Class Norman Lewis, who died in a motorcycle crash while searching for him. As hundreds of law enforcement officers scramble to find a man called "armed and extremely dangerous," here are the latest developments: Reward raised to $100,000 Authorities increased the reward for information leading to Loyd's arrest to $100,000, Orlando police Chief John Mina said Tuesday. "The Orlando Police Department, the Orange County Sheriff's Office, the FBI, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, homeland security, the U.S. marshals -- everyone is working to capture him," he said earlier. "We believe that people who know where he is will want that money," he said. Suspect said he wanted to be on 'America's Most Wanted' Two weeks before Loyd was accused of killing his pregnant girlfriend, Sade Dixon, he posted a message on Facebook: "Goals!!!! To be on Americas most wanted". On Monday morning, Clayton received word that Loyd was near a local Walmart. She tried to confront him. "As soon as she said, 'Stop,' he basically opened fire on her," Mina said. A witness outside the Walmart described a similar scene. "I was walking down the sidewalk, right past the officer, and I heard her tell him to stop, or whatever, and he shot her," witness James Herman told CNN affiliate WFTV-TV in Orlando. "He shot her down." Fund established for officer's family Clayton was the mother of a college-age son, and Orlando police said many people have been asking how they can help. Already, however, some people have tried to profit from the officer's death. "Unfortunately, after tragic events like this, there are evil people out there who are looking to take advantage of our community, and there have already been two fake GoFundMe accounts," Mina said. He urged anyone wanting to donate to visit the verified GoFundMe page for Clayton's family. Clayton was a first responder to Pulse massacre Clayton's death was the latest blow for the Orlando Police Department, which is still reeling from the June massacre at the Pulse nightclub that left 49 people dead. "Unfortunately we still have officers that are struggling with the Pulse tragedy," the police chief said. "It's been a tough seven or eight months for us." Clayton responded moments after the mass shooting at the club, police spokeswoman Michelle Guido said. "Like many of other officers here, she was a first responder that had to go to Pulse in the early morning hours to assist," Mina said. The pursuit After the shooting, Loyd fled in a car and fired shots at another officer, police said. That officer was not seriously injured. The suspect then abandoned the first vehicle and carjacked another one. He ditched that second vehicle shortly afterward and ran into an apartment complex, Mina said. It's unclear where he is now. But a "be on the lookout" alert has been sent nationwide, which is standard procedure with Florida murder suspects, said Guido, the police spokeswoman. "I believe there have been people out there helping him all along," Mina said. "If we find out about those people, we will criminally charge them." He said Loyd would be charged with first-degree murder of a law enforcement officer and attempted murder of the officer at whom he fired. Colleagues mourn deaths of longtime officers Two departments must now hunt for the suspect while grieving the deaths of their colleagues. Clayton, the Orlando police master sergeant, was married and the mother of a college-age son. "I've known Debra for 17 years.

Debra Clayton shot outside Walmart By HOLLY YAN AND NICK VALENCIA , CNN Posted: 4:26 AM, January 10, 2017 Updated: 3:02 PM, January 10, 2017 Orlando Police Department via CNN More National Headlines Orlando police officer killed; sheriff's deputy dies during manhunt Orlando tragedy: Two officers remembered ORLANDO (CNN) - The massive search for a man suspected of killing his pregnant girlfriend and gunning down an Orlando police officer has expanded beyond Florida, police said Tuesday. Markeith Loyd has been on the run since Monday morning when police say he killed Master Sgt. Debra Clayton as she tried to confront the murder suspect outside a Walmart. The manhunt for Loyd has already led to several injuries and the death of Orange County Sheriff's Deputy 1st Class Norman Lewis, who died in a motorcycle crash while searching for him. As hundreds of law enforcement officers scramble to find a man called "armed and extremely dangerous," here are the latest developments: Reward raised to $100,000 Authorities increased the reward for information leading to Loyd's arrest to $100,000, Orlando police Chief John Mina said Tuesday. "The Orlando Police Department, the Orange County Sheriff's Office, the FBI, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, homeland security, the U.S. marshals -- everyone is working to capture him," he said earlier. "We believe that people who know where he is will want that money," he said. Suspect said he wanted to be on 'America's Most Wanted' Two weeks before Loyd was accused of killing his pregnant girlfriend, Sade Dixon, he posted a message on Facebook: "Goals!!!! To be on Americas most wanted". On Monday morning, Clayton received word that Loyd was near a local Walmart. She tried to confront him. "As soon as she said, 'Stop,' he basically opened fire on her," Mina said. A witness outside the Walmart described a similar scene. "I was walking down the sidewalk, right past the officer, and I heard her tell him to stop, or whatever, and he shot her," witness James Herman told CNN affiliate WFTV-TV in Orlando. "He shot her down." Fund established for officer's family Clayton was the mother of a college-age son, and Orlando police said many people have been asking how they can help. Already, however, some people have tried to profit from the officer's death. "Unfortunately, after tragic events like this, there are evil people out there who are looking to take advantage of our community, and there have already been two fake GoFundMe accounts," Mina said. He urged anyone wanting to donate to visit the verified GoFundMe page for Clayton's family. Clayton was a first responder to Pulse massacre Clayton's death was the latest blow for the Orlando Police Department, which is still reeling from the June massacre at the Pulse nightclub that left 49 people dead. "Unfortunately we still have officers that are struggling with the Pulse tragedy," the police chief said. "It's been a tough seven or eight months for us." Clayton responded moments after the mass shooting at the club, police spokeswoman Michelle Guido said. "Like many of other officers here, she was a first responder that had to go to Pulse in the early morning hours to assist," Mina said. The pursuit After the shooting, Loyd fled in a car and fired shots at another officer, police said. That officer was not seriously injured. The suspect then abandoned the first vehicle and carjacked another one. He ditched that second vehicle shortly afterward and ran into an apartment complex, Mina said. It's unclear where he is now. But a "be on the lookout" alert has been sent nationwide, which is standard procedure with Florida murder suspects, said Guido, the police spokeswoman. "I believe there have been people out there helping him all along," Mina said. "If we find out about those people, we will criminally charge them." He said Loyd would be charged with first-degree murder of a law enforcement officer and attempted murder of the officer at whom he fired. Colleagues mourn deaths of longtime officers Two departments must now hunt for the suspect while grieving the deaths of their colleagues. Clayton, the Orlando police master sergeant, was married and the mother of a college-age son. "I've known Debra for 17 years. She was extremely committed to our youth and the community," the police chief said. "She did so many different projects in the community. She organized several marches against violence by herself." Lewis, the sheriff's deputy killed in the crash, was also known as "Big Norm," friends said. "'Big Norm' was known as much for his infectious ear-to-ear smile as he was his 6-foot-3, nearly 300-pound towering frame," Orlando attorney Brian Sandor said. "His smile and laugh took over any room he was in." Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said his department is grappling with the loss.

(AP) — Authorities raised to $100,000 the reward for information leading to the arrest of a suspect in the fatal shooting of an Orlando police sergeant on Tuesday as he eluded hundreds of officers on the second day of a massive manhunt. Authorities advised that arrest warrants were being prepared for people who may have helped 41-year-old Markeith Loyd evade deputies in the past month as they searched for him for questioning in the slaying of his pregnant ex-girlfriend in December. Master Sgt. Debra Clayton was fatally shot Monday morning after she approached Loyd in the parking lot of a Wal-Mart store in northwest Orlando. Many of her colleagues immediately joined the pursuit; among them was a sheriff's deputy who died when he was thrown from his motorcycle in an accident. More than 300 tips from the public have been made, said Barb Bergin, executive director of Crimeline, the tip-line service which is offering the reward, originally set for $60,000. "We have never burned or harmed a tipster. They are kept anonymous," Bergin said in a plea for more tips. "We will not identify you. We just need to know where he is so no one else is hurt." Graphiq Orange County Sheriff's Office deputies in metro Orlando had been looking for Loyd since his ex-girlfriend was killed. "Certainly it's upsetting he was out and about and killed Debra Clayton, our first homicide in the city of Orlando this year, one of the officers protecting our community," said Mina. Orlando Police confirmed that Clayton was one of the officers who responded to the shooting at Pulse nightclub in which 49 patrons were killed. Last June's massacre in Orlando was the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Clayton, who was married and has a college-aged son, also was known for her mentoring of young people and her involvement in the community in which she had grown up. In the Wal-Mart parking lot Tuesday morning, shoppers laid more than two dozen bouquets of flowers, teddy bears and candles in a makeshift memorial. Some shoppers, like Hal Shore, stopped to say a prayer or take a photo. "It's important that the country is aware that there is a war against police officers," said Shore, a cabinet maker. An apartment complex that was the focus of the manhunt Monday afternoon didn't appear to have any police searches going on Tuesday morning. Some front doors were boarded up from being kicked in Monday because residents weren't home when authorities came knocking. Graphiq "I'm confident he is gone," said Ida Seck, a resident who had worked with Clayton in her job as a security officer at Universal Orlando Resort. "For things like this to happen, yeah I'm scared for safety and my son's safety but really there is nothing you can do." Court documents show Loyd's criminal record goes back two decades. He was arrested in 1996 on a murder charge that was later dropped. Loyd was arrested for battery on an officer in 1998 and sentenced to more than four years in prison. While behind bars, he pleaded guilty to cocaine possession from a prior case and was transferred to federal prison before being released in July 2014, according to federal records. More recently, his wife whom he is in the process of divorcing, had filed a request for a temporary injunction against him in 2015, and he followed with a similar request against her three days later. Both requests were eventually dismissed in court. He also had paternity suits from three different women filed against him. His Facebook profile had videos of him working out at a gym and hanging out at a nightclub. He said in a November post, "Goals!!!! To be on Americas (sic) most wanted," followed by a series of laughing-with-tears emojis. An Orange County Sheriff's Office deputy was killed more than two hours after Monday's shooting when a van collided with his motorcycle as he responded to the manhunt. Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings described the 35-year-old Norman Lewis as "a gentle giant," and the sheriff's office said he had played football for the University of Central Florida before joining the agency 11 years ago. Graphiq Funerals were planned for Lewis for Friday and Clayton for Saturday. Today's Deals Powered by SHOP NOW LG K7 Android 4G Smartphone for Walmart for $50 + free...

(AP) — Authorities raised to $100,000 the reward for information leading to the arrest of a suspect in the fatal shooting of an Orlando police sergeant on Tuesday as he eluded hundreds of officers on the second day of a massive manhunt. Authorities advised that arrest warrants were being prepared for people who may have helped 41-year-old Markeith Loyd evade deputies in the past month as they searched for him for questioning in the slaying of his pregnant ex-girlfriend in December. Master Sgt. Debra Clayton was fatally shot Monday morning after she approached Loyd in the parking lot of a Wal-Mart store in northwest Orlando. Many of her colleagues immediately joined the pursuit; among them was a sheriff's deputy who died when he was thrown from his motorcycle in an accident. More than 300 tips from the public have been made, said Barb Bergin, executive director of Crimeline, the tip-line service which is offering the reward, originally set for $60,000. "We have never burned or harmed a tipster. They are kept anonymous," Bergin said in a plea for more tips. "We will not identify you. We just need to know where he is so no one else is hurt." Graphiq Orange County Sheriff's Office deputies in metro Orlando had been looking for Loyd since his ex-girlfriend was killed. "Certainly it's upsetting he was out and about and killed Debra Clayton, our first homicide in the city of Orlando this year, one of the officers protecting our community," said Mina. Orlando Police confirmed that Clayton was one of the officers who responded to the shooting at Pulse nightclub in which 49 patrons were killed. Last June's massacre in Orlando was the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Clayton, who was married and has a college-aged son, also was known for her mentoring of young people and her involvement in the community in which she had grown up. In the Wal-Mart parking lot Tuesday morning, shoppers laid more than two dozen bouquets of flowers, teddy bears and candles in a makeshift memorial. Some shoppers, like Hal Shore, stopped to say a prayer or take a photo. "It's important that the country is aware that there is a war against police officers," said Shore, a cabinet maker. An apartment complex that was the focus of the manhunt Monday afternoon didn't appear to have any police searches going on Tuesday morning. Some front doors were boarded up from being kicked in Monday because residents weren't home when authorities came knocking. Graphiq "I'm confident he is gone," said Ida Seck, a resident who had worked with Clayton in her job as a security officer at Universal Orlando Resort. "For things like this to happen, yeah I'm scared for safety and my son's safety but really there is nothing you can do." Court documents show Loyd's criminal record goes back two decades. He was arrested in 1996 on a murder charge that was later dropped. Loyd was arrested for battery on an officer in 1998 and sentenced to more than four years in prison. While behind bars, he pleaded guilty to cocaine possession from a prior case and was transferred to federal prison before being released in July 2014, according to federal records. More recently, his wife whom he is in the process of divorcing, had filed a request for a temporary injunction against him in 2015, and he followed with a similar request against her three days later. Both requests were eventually dismissed in court. He also had paternity suits from three different women filed against him. His Facebook profile had videos of him working out at a gym and hanging out at a nightclub. He said in a November post, "Goals!!!! To be on Americas (sic) most wanted," followed by a series of laughing-with-tears emojis. An Orange County Sheriff's Office deputy was killed more than two hours after Monday's shooting when a van collided with his motorcycle as he responded to the manhunt. Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings described the 35-year-old Norman Lewis as "a gentle giant," and the sheriff's office said he had played football for the University of Central Florida before joining the agency 11 years ago.

The suspect, identified at Markeith Loyd, is considered “armed and extremely dangerous.” Hundreds of law enforcement officers have been hunting for him since Orlando police Master Sgt. Debra Clayton, 42, was shot outside a Walmart on Monday. On Monday morning, Clayton had received word that Loyd, who is a suspect in the killing of his pregnant girlfriend, was near a local Walmart. She chased after him and was fatally shot. The suspect fled the scene, triggering an intense manhunt that included door-to-door searches in apartment complexes. Dozens of schools were placed on lockdown until Monday afternoon. Hours later, another officer died while taking part in the manhunt when his motorcycle collided with another vehicle. He was identified as Orange County Sheriff’s Deputy First Class Norman Lewis. With two officers dead and a suspect at large, police have vowed to find Loyd. They are offering up to $60,000 in reward for information leading to his arrest. “I’m confident we will find him,” said Orlando Police Chief John Mina. “It doesn’t matter where he is. We will track him down to the ends of the Earth to find him.” The pursuit After the shooting, Loyd fled in a vehicle and fired shots at another officer, police said. That officer was not seriously injured. The suspect then abandoned the first vehicle and carjacked another one. He ditched that second vehicle shortly after and ran into an apartment complex, Mina said. Residents were urged to stay inside. Mina said officers searched “dozens of apartments and residences.” “I believe there have been people out there helping him all along,” he said. “If we find out about those people we will criminally charge them.” He said Loyd would be charged with first-degree murder of a law enforcement officer and attempted murder of the officer he fired at. Many officers in the area joined the effort to find Loyd. Among them was Deputy Norman Lewis with the Orange County Sheriff’s, who died in a crash as he was on his motorcycle. “A motorist turned in front of him,” Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said. “Based on eyewitness testimony, he had a green light, he was not traveling at any (high) rate of speed.” Lewis had worked 11 years with the sheriff’s department. “To lose two law enforcement officers on this Law Enforcement Officer Appreciation Day is indeed a tragedy,” the sheriff said. The department is mourning Lewis, but there is also a suspect on the loose. “While we’re processing our own emotional feelings, we still have a job to do,” Demings said. ‘He shot her down’ The shooting happened early Monday morning after Clayton had received word that Loyd was in the area near a local Walmart. She radioed at 7:17 a.m. to say she was trying to contact a murder suspect. Loyd was wanted in the December 13 fatal shooting of Sade Dixon, 24, his pregnant girlfriend, CNN affiliate WFTV reported. Clayton tried to stop Loyd and briefly chased the suspect on foot, said the Orlando police chief. “As soon as she said stop, he basically opened fire on her,” Mina said. A witness outside the Walmart described a similar scene. “I was walking down the sidewalk, right past the officer, and I heard her tell him to stop, or whatever, and he shot her,” witness James Herman told CNN affiliate WFTV. “He shot her down.” The gunman continued shooting behind him as he was running from the scene, Herman said. He also said the man wore a security shirt, but Mina said the suspect was not a security guard. Clayton returned fire but investigators don’t think she struck the gunman, Mina said. Colleagues mourn death of veteran officer Mina said his department is grieving the death of Clayton, a 17-year veteran. “I’ve known Debra for 17 years. She was extremely committed to our youth and the community. She did so many different projects in the community. “She organized several marches against violence by herself,” the police chief said. Clayton was married and the mother of a college-age son. Clayton’s death marks the first fatal shooting of a law enforcement officer in the United States in 2017, said Steve Groeninger of the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund. Clayton and Lewis are the second and third on-duty law enforcement officer to die in 2017. 5 things for Tuesday, January 10, 2017: Orlando manhunt, Jeff Sessions, Donald Trump Clemson shocks Alabama to win first national title in 35 years Related Posts Student dies after fight at Delaware high school Flag burner arrested, won’t be charged Suspect indicted in New York, New Jersey bombings ‘Little Siberia:’ Prison near Canadian border has history of tough inmates Leave a Reply Cancel reply You must be logged in to post a comment.

Name: Subject: Message: Avoid long checkout lines with the new Walmart Scan & Go app for Android Apps & Games Newsby Mitja Rutnik6 days ago 15 444 40 Long checkout lines in stores are one of the most annoying parts of shopping. Especially for people who are a bit impatient by nature. Retailers are trying different things to make the checkout process faster, but not all of them work as planned. Walmart is one of the retailers trying to fix this problem. The company has recently released its Scan & Go Android app that promises to speed up the shopping process. How does it work, you ask? When you’re shopping in a Walmart store, simply open the app and scan the barcode of each product before you place it in your shopping cart. As you shop, you’ll see the running total of the items in your cart. Once you’ve scanned all the products, simply pay the bill in the app and show the receipt that appears on your phone to the exit greeter on the way out. See also: 10 best shopping apps for Android March 10, 2016 By using the app, you really do save quite a bit of time when shopping at Walmart, especially if the store is crowded. Keep in mind that there is more work involved than usual, as you have to scan all the products yourself. It looks like Walmart is currently testing the app to see how it works in real life scenarios. That’s probably one of the reasons why you can only use it in one store for now, which is located in Rogers, Arkansas. Hopefully, you’ll eventually be able to use the app in other Walmart stores across the country as well. If you want to try out the Walmart Scan & Go app, simply click the button below and visit the Google Play Store to download it to your device.

Debra Clayton was shot at the Wal-Mart at 3101 West Princeton St. on Monday morning. She was taken to Orlando Regional Medical Center, where she died, Orlando Police said. The Orlando Police Department family is heartbroken today. One of our own was taken in the line of duty. There are no words. pic.twitter.com/M48o1nnr4h — Orlando Police (@OrlandoPolice) January 9, 2017 At a Monday afternoon, news conference, Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said several hundred law enforcement officials are looking for Loyd and urged him turn himself in. The search is centered on Brookside Apartments on Cinderlane Parkway in Orlando, where people and vehicles continue to be turned away around the area as the manhunt goes on. Orlando Police teams have searched hundreds of apartments at the complex, Orlando Police Chief John Mina said. SWAT team members are at the scene — we will not reveal any of their tactical locations for their safety. Officers were seen boarding up one of the apartments Monday evening. "We're not going anywhere. If we don't have this individual by nightfall, we're not going anywhere," Demings said. "We will work with anyone to bring him to justice... Otherwise, this is going to be a very risky operation for all of us." Earlier Monday — which also marked Law Enforcement Appreciation Day — Orlando Police Chief John Mina praised Clayton, 42, a 17-year veteran of the force. "Debra Clayton is a hero and she gave her life protecting the community that she loves. She will be deeply missed," Mina said. "We are giving everything her husband needs... She is married with children," he said. City Commissioner of District 5 Regina Hill expressed horror and grief over the death of Clayton, whom Hill said was her liaison with the police department. "Oh God!!!! Please pray for my OPD Liaison, She's been shot down in Pine Hills," she posted about Clayton. Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer declared a day of mourning in the City of Orlando following the deaths in the line of duty of Clayton and the deputy. Gov. Rick Scott, who was in town for unrelated events, attended Monday's news conference. Loyd, 41, was already being sought by Orange County deputies in connection with the December shooting death of his pregnant ex-girlfriend, Sade Dixon, 24, who was shot dead at her home. Her brother, Ronald Steward, was also shot and hospitalized. Loyd has had several drug, battery and robbery charges against him. In the some of the cases, he was found guilty; others have been dismissed. Orlando Police said Clayton was trying to contact a murder suspect at the Wal-Mart just after 7 a.m. Monday when she was shot. She returned fire, according to Mina, but Loyd was not thought to be struck. After the shooting of Clayton at the Wal-Mart, an Orange County Sheriff's Office deputy spotted Loyd fleeing in a vehicle at North Lane and Pine Hills Drive. When Loyd pulled into a nearby apartment complex, he allegedly shot at the deputy and also struck his unmarked Sheriff's Office vehicle twice, officials said.  Pine Hills resident Jamie Keen was taking her two children to school and says she saw the whole thing. I was literally right behind the officer's car,” she explained. If he would have missed that car he could have definitely could have hit our vehicle or some of us in the car." The deputy was unharmed. Loyd then carjacked a vehicle and fled again, Orlando Police said. He reportedly abandoned that vehicle near the intersection of Rosemont and Cinderlane Parkway, where the manhunt was centered. Keen says enough is enough. "Stop the gun violence to be honest, this is out of control,” Keen said. "etween our youths and our kids and I have two young, young boys. This is not something I wanted them to see." Several hours into the manhunt, Crimeline raised the reward for information leading to the arrest of Loyd to $60,000. Call Crimeline at 1-800-423-TIPS (8477). Callers can remain anonymous. Gov. Rick Scott, who attended Monday morning's news conference, issued this statement: “I am heartbroken and angered to hear of the shooting and death of Master Sgt. Debra Clayton this morning. I am also saddened by the death of an Orange County Sheriff’s Deputy who tragically lost his life in a vehicle accident while responding to this morning’s shooting. My wife Ann and I join Floridians across the state in praying for these officers and their families during this unimaginable time. "I proclaimed this week as First Responder Appreciation week, and on the first day of it today, this tragic shooting serves as a sobering reminder of how important it is for each one of us to take every opportunity to thank these heroes for their service and sacrifice.” Officials described Loyd as armed and dangerous and warned the public not to approach him but to call 911. “It doesn’t matter where he goes, we will track him down to the end of the earth," Mina said Monday. “We’re bringing this dirt bag to justice and he’s going to jail." The Walmart was closed through much of the day, reopening in the afternoon. The story is making counselors available for associates, as needed. Walmart released this statement Monday: "We're heartbroken by the Orlando police officer's and Orange County deputy's passing. Our thoughts and prayers are with their families and with both departments for their losses." The last time an Orlando Police officer was killed in the line of duty was Oct. 4, 2007, according to Orlando Police, when Officer Al Gordon was gunned down in a robbery near an ATM at Silver Star and North Hiawassee roads. &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;nbsp; Orange County deputy dies, another hurt Meanwhile, an Orange County motorcycle deputy involved in the manhunt collided with a minivan on Balboa Drive and Pine Hills Road and was taken to ORMC in critical condition, according to troopers. Deputy Norman Lewis, 35, from Orlando, died at ORMC, according to FHP Sgt. Kim Montes and the Sheriff's Office. The minivan, driven by 78-year-old Billie Jarrard of Clermont, pulled directly into the deputy's path, and charges are pending against the minivan's driver, Montes said. Sean Manuel, a witness to the Balboa Drive crash, said he and some men were passing by at about 9:30 a.m. when the motor deputy approached. He said they pulled over their vehicle to let Lewis pass, but just minutes later, they saw him lying in the road. That's when they jumped out to try to help. "He didn't say anything; he was mostly unconscious," Manuel said. "He then came back and squeezed my hand, but his hand was already getting cold." At the news conference Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings praised Lewis, whose identity was not released until late Monday. "We also lost a hero today," Demings said. "In my 36-year career, this has been one of the toughest days. ... To lose two law enforcement officers on Law Enforcement Appreciation Day is a tragedy." Troopers are investigating the crash, including whether Loyd could face any charges in Lewis' death. Just 20 minutes after the fatal deputy crash on Balboa Drive, a second motor deputy responding to the first deputy's crash was himself injured in a crash, troopers said. According to the FHP, a 2006 Chevrolet Impala driven by Jerry Lewis Brown, 36, of Orlando made a U-turn in the path of Deputy Nelson Borjas's motorcycle on Pine Hills Road just north of Balboa Drive. Brown was arrested on charges of driving with a suspended license. Borjas was taken to ORMC with minor injuries. A third motorcycle officer, from Orlando Police, was injured in yet a separate crash. That officer had minor injuries and is expected to be OK, Mina said. Road closures Several major roadways were shut down near rush hour as law enforcement officers search for the man wanted in connection to the police officer shooting. Cinderlane Parkway from Lake Orlando Parkway to Orange Blossom Trail was still closed Monday afternoon, where a massive apartment complex search for the suspect continues. Orange Blossom Trail northbound and Pine Hills Road near Balboa Drive were closed earlier for investigations but have reopened.

"We have searched dozens of apartments and residences in an effort to find the suspect and bring him in. We have deployed numerous officers and detectives who specialize in looking for suspects who try and avoid capture. We are using every resource possible to find him and arrest him," Mina said. But by nightfall, only a few police cruisers remained outside a lone apartment in a complex that had been swarming with SWAT team members looking for Loyd. Mina said law enforcement believes that Loyd has been receiving help to stay hidden from officers.  Law enforcement officials warned that anyone helping Loyd hide could face serious charges.  © 2017 Cox Media Group.

(Joe Burbank/Orlando Sentinel) Rene Stutzman and Stephanie Allen Contact Reporters Privacy Policy Hundreds of law enforcement officers are searching overnight for a fugitive who is accused of killing a cop at dawn on Monday when she tried to chase him down at a Wal-Mart and arrest him. A second law-enforcement official died in a crash just hours later as officers and deputies scrambled to find the murder suspect.  By Monday evening, officers largely abandoned the apartment complex in northwest Orlando that was the focus of their search for much of the day, and Markeith Loyd, 41, was still at large. "We are going to bring this dirtbag to justice, and he's going to jail," Orlando Police Chief John Mina said. Loyd has been wanted for murder since his pregnant ex-girlfriend was shot at her front door on Dec. 13. He has a long criminal history and on Nov. 30 wrote on his Facebook page: "Goals!!!! To be on Americas most wanted." Markeith Loyd Orange County Sheriff's Office Markeith Loyd Markeith Loyd (Orange County Sheriff's Office) The manhunt prompted the lockdown of more than a dozen schools and snarled traffic for hours. “If you don’t have to be out, don’t be out,” Orange County Mayor Teresa Jacobs said Monday morning. A $60,000 reward was offered for information leading to Loyd’s capture, and both Orlando police and the Sheriff's Office described him as armed and dangerous. The violence started about 7:15 a.m. at the Wal-Mart at John Young Parkway and Princeton Street, when someone spotted Loyd, knew he was wanted for murder and told Orlando police Master Sgt. Debra Clayton, who also happened to be at the store. She was on the job, in uniform and wearing body armor, Mina said. She called dispatch, then started chasing after Loyd. OPD officer shot and killed; deputy dies in crash Orlando Police Department Debra Clayton Debra Clayton (Orlando Police Department) She yelled for him to “stop” but instead the felon opened fire. She shot back but didn’t hit him, Mina said.  Backup officers who arrived 28 seconds later tried to save Clayton with CPR, according to the city, but she was pronounced dead at 7:40 a.m. at Orlando Regional Medical Center. A short distance from the Wal-Mart, a captain at the Orange County Sheriff's Office spotted Loyd near Pine Hills Road and North Lane, according to that department. Loyd pulled into an apartment complex and fired at least once at the deputy, who was in an unmarked SUV. The bullet missed him but hit his SUV. The suspect then carjacked a vehicle and fled. He abandoned that vehicle near Cinderlane Parkway, officials said. A massive manhunt for Loyd resulted in two motorcycle crashes by Orange County deputies, one fatal.        Deputy Norman Lewis, 35, an 11-year Sheriff’s Office veteran and former football player at the University of Central Florida, was killed 2-1/2 hours after the shooting. He was traveling south on Pine Hills Road on his motorcycle when he was struck by a van turning left onto Balboa Drive, the Florida Highway Patrol said. “We’re sad on this day for many reasons," Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said at a morning news conference at the hospital. "In my 36-year career, this is possibly one of the toughest days for me." The driver of the van, Billie Jarrard of Clermont, could possibly face charges in the crash, troopers said. No one answered the phone Monday at Jarrard’s home. Records show he is a 78-year-old recent widower with no criminal history in Florida.  Ten minutes after Lewis’ crash, another deputy was involved in a wreck that sent him to the hospital. It happened just 200 yards down Pine Hills Road. Orange County Deputy Nelson Borjas, 46, had minor injuries and is expected to recover.  Officer called a hero Clayton is the first Orlando officer killed in the line of duty in a decade. The last was Al Gordon, who was shot during a robbery Oct. 4, 2007, the agency reported. Clayton, who is survived by a husband and college-age son, was one of the first officers to respond to the mass shooting at the Pulse nightclub in June that left 49 people dead and scores injured. PICTURE GALLERY: An Orlando police officer was shot on Princeton Street, just west of John Young Parkway. An Orange County deputy died in a traffic crash during the manhunt for the suspect. Mina called her a hero. “She gave her life for the community she loves." TaQueria Jones, a Wal-Mart cashier, said Clayton checked out at her register minutes before the shooting. “We talked about family, we talked about God," Jones said.  While the suspect was still at large, the cashier and others planted flowers in a spot just feet from where Clayton was killed. “I’m going to be out here every day to straighten them up. Every day," Jones vowed. Lewis, who had been with the Sheriff's Office since March 2005, was a member of the motors/DUI unit. Both Lewis and Clayton had degrees from the University of Central Florida. “They are heroes and Knights forever," UCF President John Hitt said. Deputies had been on the lookout for Loyd for weeks because of a murder warrant: He's accused of murdering his pregnant 24-year-old ex-girlfriend, Sade Dixon, on Dec. 13 and wounding her 26-year-old brother, Ronald Steward. They were shot at an Orange County home on Long Peak Drive.

(Joe Burbank/Orlando Sentinel) Loyd has a long criminal record and served 10 years in prison and five years on probation for conspiracy with intent to distribute cocaine, according to federal court records.  "To lose two law enforcement officers on this Law Enforcement Appreciation Day is indeed a tragedy,” Demings said. ... “It's a reminder that law enforcement officers put their lives on the line every single day to protect all of us." Gov. Rick Scott was in Orlando on Monday for a business meeting, but that was canceled and he joined Mina, Demings and other local officials at a morning news conference. "It breaks my heart that one of them was already senselessly killed this morning,” Scott said. Apartments focus of search On Monday, officers searched dozens of apartments, single-family homes and vehicles in the Rosemont neighborhood. Much of the search focused on the Eagle Reserve apartment complex.  An Orlando SWAT team as well as armored vehicles and a helicopter came and went twice to the complex on Cinderlane Parkway, where Loyd was last spotted by law enforcement Monday morning after the shooting. They pulled out for the second time about 6 p.m., but only after leaving some residents barred from their homes or from getting to work for several hours. Lupe Garcia and her 9-year-old son, Migul Hidalgo, were stuck outside their home for most of the day. Garcia walked to drop him off at school and came back to find her home surrounded in crime scene tape with dozens of officers holding long guns.

(Joe Burbank/Orlando Sentinel) Rene Stutzman and Stephanie Allen Contact Reporters Privacy Policy Hundreds of law enforcement officers are searching overnight for a fugitive who is accused of killing a cop at dawn on Monday when she tried to chase him down at a Wal-Mart and arrest him. A second law-enforcement official died in a crash just hours later as officers and deputies scrambled to find the murder suspect.  By Monday evening, officers largely abandoned the apartment complex in northwest Orlando that was the focus of their search for much of the day, and Markeith Loyd, 41, was still at large. "We are going to bring this dirtbag to justice, and he's going to jail," Orlando Police Chief John Mina said. Loyd has been wanted for murder since his pregnant ex-girlfriend was shot at her front door on Dec. 13. He has a long criminal history and on Nov. 30 wrote on his Facebook page: "Goals!!!! To be on Americas most wanted." Markeith Loyd Orange County Sheriff's Office Markeith Loyd Markeith Loyd (Orange County Sheriff's Office) The manhunt prompted the lockdown of more than a dozen schools and snarled traffic for hours. “If you don’t have to be out, don’t be out,” Orange County Mayor Teresa Jacobs said Monday morning. A $60,000 reward was offered for information leading to Loyd’s capture, and both Orlando police and the Sheriff's Office described him as armed and dangerous. The violence started about 7:15 a.m. at the Wal-Mart at John Young Parkway and Princeton Street, when someone spotted Loyd, knew he was wanted for murder and told Orlando police Master Sgt. Debra Clayton, who also happened to be at the store. She was on the job, in uniform and wearing body armor, Mina said. She called dispatch, then started chasing after Loyd. OPD officer shot and killed; deputy dies in crash Orlando Police Department Debra Clayton Debra Clayton (Orlando Police Department) She yelled for him to “stop” but instead the felon opened fire. She shot back but didn’t hit him, Mina said.  Backup officers who arrived 28 seconds later tried to save Clayton with CPR, according to the city, but she was pronounced dead at 7:40 a.m. at Orlando Regional Medical Center. A short distance from the Wal-Mart, a captain at the Orange County Sheriff's Office spotted Loyd near Pine Hills Road and North Lane, according to that department. Loyd pulled into an apartment complex and fired at least once at the deputy, who was in an unmarked SUV. The bullet missed him but hit his SUV. The suspect then carjacked a vehicle and fled. He abandoned that vehicle near Cinderlane Parkway, officials said. A massive manhunt for Loyd resulted in two motorcycle crashes by Orange County deputies, one fatal.        Deputy Norman Lewis, 35, an 11-year Sheriff’s Office veteran and former football player at the University of Central Florida, was killed 2-1/2 hours after the shooting. He was traveling south on Pine Hills Road on his motorcycle when he was struck by a van turning left onto Balboa Drive, the Florida Highway Patrol said. “We’re sad on this day for many reasons," Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said at a morning news conference at the hospital. "In my 36-year career, this is possibly one of the toughest days for me." The driver of the van, Billie Jarrard of Clermont, could possibly face charges in the crash, troopers said. No one answered the phone Monday at Jarrard’s home. Records show he is a 78-year-old recent widower with no criminal history in Florida.  Ten minutes after Lewis’ crash, another deputy was involved in a wreck that sent him to the hospital. It happened just 200 yards down Pine Hills Road. Orange County Deputy Nelson Borjas, 46, had minor injuries and is expected to recover.  Officer called a hero Clayton is the first Orlando officer killed in the line of duty in a decade. The last was Al Gordon, who was shot during a robbery Oct. 4, 2007, the agency reported. Clayton, who is survived by a husband and college-age son, was one of the first officers to respond to the mass shooting at the Pulse nightclub in June that left 49 people dead and scores injured. PICTURE GALLERY: An Orlando police officer was shot on Princeton Street, just west of John Young Parkway. An Orange County deputy died in a traffic crash during the manhunt for the suspect. Mina called her a hero. “She gave her life for the community she loves." TaQueria Jones, a Wal-Mart cashier, said Clayton checked out at her register minutes before the shooting. “We talked about family, we talked about God," Jones said.  While the suspect was still at large, the cashier and others planted flowers in a spot just feet from where Clayton was killed. “I’m going to be out here every day to straighten them up. Every day," Jones vowed. Lewis, who had been with the Sheriff's Office since March 2005, was a member of the motors/DUI unit. Both Lewis and Clayton had degrees from the University of Central Florida. “They are heroes and Knights forever," UCF President John Hitt said. Deputies had been on the lookout for Loyd for weeks because of a murder warrant: He's accused of murdering his pregnant 24-year-old ex-girlfriend, Sade Dixon, on Dec. 13 and wounding her 26-year-old brother, Ronald Steward. They were shot at an Orange County home on Long Peak Drive.

(Joe Burbank/Orlando Sentinel) Loyd has a long criminal record and served 10 years in prison and five years on probation for conspiracy with intent to distribute cocaine, according to federal court records.  "To lose two law enforcement officers on this Law Enforcement Appreciation Day is indeed a tragedy,” Demings said. ... “It's a reminder that law enforcement officers put their lives on the line every single day to protect all of us." Gov. Rick Scott was in Orlando on Monday for a business meeting, but that was canceled and he joined Mina, Demings and other local officials at a morning news conference. "It breaks my heart that one of them was already senselessly killed this morning,” Scott said. Apartments focus of search On Monday, officers searched dozens of apartments, single-family homes and vehicles in the Rosemont neighborhood. Much of the search focused on the Eagle Reserve apartment complex.  An Orlando SWAT team as well as armored vehicles and a helicopter came and went twice to the complex on Cinderlane Parkway, where Loyd was last spotted by law enforcement Monday morning after the shooting. They pulled out for the second time about 6 p.m., but only after leaving some residents barred from their homes or from getting to work for several hours. Lupe Garcia and her 9-year-old son, Migul Hidalgo, were stuck outside their home for most of the day. Garcia walked to drop him off at school and came back to find her home surrounded in crime scene tape with dozens of officers holding long guns. "It's scary," she said before she was let back into the complex. After she picked her son up, they waited with dozens of others outside the complex. Migul said as he and his mom were waiting, an Orange County deputy flagged him down and asked if he was hungry. The deputy pulled out a chocolate protein bar and gave it to the boy.

(MEDIA GENERAL) — A police officer shot and killed Monday morning in Orlando was a married mother who died protecting the community she loved, according to the Orlando Police Department’s chief of police, John Mina. Master Sgt. Debra Clayton passed away about an hour after she was shot outside a Walmart in a northwest neighborhood of the city. Chief Mina said Clayton, a 17-year veteran of the force, was extremely committed to Orlando’s youth. She had a “smile and a high-five for every kid she came across,” a tweet by the department stated. They later posted a picture of a smiling Clayton standing with two young boys with the caption “THIS is how we know and remember Sergeant Debra Clayton.” THIS is how we know and remember Sergeant Debra Clayton. She always had a smile for kids and always took a moment to interact w/community. pic.twitter.com/8zL46iyUe6 — Orlando Police (@OrlandoPolice) January 9, 2017 Chief Mina said Clayton also organized several marches against violence by herself. “Debra Clayon is a hero,” he declared. “She gave her life protecting the community that she loves. She will be deeply missed.” Master Sgt. Clayton was deeply committed to the community and to police work. pic.twitter.com/BBelv7Et1V — Orlando Police (@OrlandoPolice) January 9, 2017 The suspect in the shooting has been identified as Markeith Loyd. At the time of Clayton’s murder, Loyd, 41, was a suspect in the December murder of his pregnant ex-girlfriend. A second law enforcement officer, a deputy with the Orange County Sheriff’s Office, also died Monday. Deputy First Class Norman Lewis, an 11-year veteran, was killed in a motorcycle crash while pursing Loyd.

A $60-thousand-dollar reward is being offered for information for Markeith Loyd, the suspected shooter in the death of the Orlando Police Department officer Master Sargent Debra Clayton on Monday, January 9, 2017, according to a tweet from the Orlando... By Holly Yan, Ralph Ellis and AnneClaire Stapleton CNN (CNN) -- Hundreds of law enforcement officers were scouring Orlando early Tuesday for a man suspected of fatally shooting a police officer outside a Walmart. The suspect fled, triggering an intense manhunt that included door-to-door searches in apartment complexes and the placing of a dozen schools on lockdown. Another officer died while taking part in the search for the gunman. The Orange County sheriff's deputy died when his motorcycle collided with another vehicle. After the deaths of two law enforcement officers in one day, Orlando Police Chief John Mina vowed to find the suspect -- who has been identified as Markeith Loyd. "I'm confident we will find him," Mina said. "It doesn't matter where he is. We will track him down to the ends of the Earth to find him." "To lose two law enforcement officers on this Law Enforcement Officer Appreciation Day is indeed a tragedy," Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said. Loyd also is wanted in the killing of a pregnant woman in December, Mina said. A reward of up to $60,000 is offered for information leading to Loyd's arrest. The officer he is suspected of shooting was identified as Orlando police Master Sgt. Debra Clayton, 42. The second officer who died in the accident was identified as Deputy First Class Norman Lewis. "To lose two law enforcement officers on this Law Enforcement Officer Appreciation Day is indeed a tragedy," Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said. 'He shot her down' On Monday morning, someone at a Walmart had contacted Clayton and told her Loyd was in the area, Mina said. It appears Clayton briefly chased the suspect on foot. "As soon as she said stop, he basically opened fire on her," the chief said. One witness told CNN affiliate WFTV he had been outside the Walmart when the shooting happened. "I was walking down the sidewalk, right past the officer, and I heard her tell him to stop, or whatever, and he shot her. He shot her down," said James Herman. Herman said the man continued shooting behind him as he was running from the scene. He also said the man wore a security shirt, but Mina said the suspect was not a security guard. "That's not uncommon," he said. "We run into people in nightclubs that wear T-shirts that say FBI, police." Clayton returned fire but investigators don't think she struck the gunman, Mina said. Two minutes after Clayton's last radio contact, police received a call of an officer shot. Officers performed CPR but could not revive Clayton. The pursuit After the shooting, Loyd fled in a vehicle and fired shots at another officer, police said. Hundreds of law enforcement officers descended on the area. The suspect abandoned the vehicle and carjacked a different one, police said. He ditched that second vehicle shortly after and ran into an apartment complex, Mina said. Residents were urged to stay inside and several schools were put on lockdown. By 3 p.m. ET, the lockdowns had been lifted at all the schools, the school system said on Twitter. Mina said officers searched "dozens of apartments and residences" and won't slow down because of darkness. "I believe there have been people out there helping him all along," Mina said. "If we find out about those people we will criminally charge them." He said Loyd would be charged with first-degree murder of a law enforcement officer and attempted murder of the officer he fired at. Sheriff's deputy killed As authorities scrambled to find Loyd, Deputy First Class Norman Lewis died in a crash as he was traveling on his motorcycle. "A motorist turned in front of him," the sheriff said. "Based on eyewitness testimony, he had a green light, he was not traveling at any (high) rate of speed." Lewis had worked 11 years with the sheriff's department. In another incident, police said the suspect fired at an Orange County sheriff's captain who spotted his vehicle. The captain was not seriously injured, but authorities are pursuing an attempted murder charge against the suspect. Suspect had been wanted in girlfriend's death CNN affiliate WFTV reported that Loyd was wanted in the December 13 fatal shooting of Sade Dixon, 24, his pregnant girlfriend, outside her home in the Pine Hills neighborhood. She was the mother of a 5-year-old and a 7-year-old. Dixon's brother, Ronald Steward, was critically injured when he tried to come to Dixon's aid, WFTV reported, citing deputies. A hero who went above and beyond Mina said his department is grieving the death of Clayton, a 17-year veteran at the department. "I've known Debra for 17 years. She was extremely committed to our youth and the community. She did so many different projects in the community. She organized several marches against violence by herself," the police chief said. Clayton was married and the mother of a college-age son. The sheriff said his department also is mourning the death of its deputy. But with an "armed and extremely dangerous" killer on the loose, there is little time to grieve. "While we're processing our own emotional feelings, we still have a job to do," Demings said. Clayton's death marks the first fatal shooting of a law enforcement officer in the United States in 2017, said Steve Groeninger of the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund.

News Facebook Feedback Jan.10: Counterfeit money, Inmate program, Officer burned Privacy Policy Man accused of using counterfeit money The York-Poquoson Sheriff's Office is searching for a man accused of using counterfeit money at the Wal-Mart in York County last month. The man used the money at the store at 2601 George Washington Memorial Highway on Dec. 20, officials said on social media. •Steve Hurley: That Wal-Mart gets a lot of attention lately. Hampton program helps prepare inmates Darnell W. Parker Sr. is teaching a seminar at Hampton City Jail, aiming to educate incarcerated fathers about how to take back their paternal responsibility once they leave the lock-up. •Lesley DeVries: Only male inmates? What about the mothers in jail? I find it VERY discriminating that you only think men need programs like this! •Stenson Robin: Yes. There are a lot of programs for men. Not so much for women. Come on now, we need both parents. •Stacey Cooper: He is only one person. We do not know the red tape behind what he is doing. Try to see the positive side instead of the negative side. •Joy Snead Lockhart: Some prisons do have programs for mothers and even allow the babies to stay with their mothers for a time after they're born. If Mr. Parker is willing to help these men become better fathers and citizens, he should be applauded! And so should the men that are changing. •John Grady Harris: This is awesome. Police: Caustic substance thrown in officer's face A Norfolk police sergeant was significantly burned Monday after a man went up to the officer and threw a caustic substance in his face, according to police reports. The sergeant was transported to Sentara Norfolk General Hospital with what police called significant burn injuries.

By Tracey Kaplan | tkaplan@bayareanewsgroup.com | PUBLISHED: January 9, 2017 at 1:54 pm | UPDATED: January 10, 2017 at 3:04 am SAN JOSE — A man accused of a drug-addled Easter rampage that ended after he barreled his car through the window of a Wal-mart and bludgeoned shoppers with a metal bar was sentenced Monday to eight years in state prison. The sentence imposed on Haamid Ade Zaid, now 37, covers both the Easter 2013 crash, as well as a similar incident in  2012. In that case, Zaid drove his Lexus into a Chevron gas station on W. Capitol Expressway, smashing the car through the glass front doors and barely missing two employees working inside the market. Zaid had pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity, delaying the resolution of the case. But last month, he pleaded as charged to 10 counts of felony assault with a deadly weapon, as well as felony vandalism, and reckless driving. The sentence was the result of an offer by Superior Court Judge Daniel Nishigaya, rather than a plea deal. “It has been nearly four years since these incidents occurred and a long road to get justice for the victims,” prosecutor Deborah Hernandez said in a written statement. The case raised questions at the time among Zaid’s West San Jose neighbors, who wondered how Zaid, who was arrested in a string of troubling cases over a two-year period, was out of jail on March 31, 2013, the Easter Sunday when he rammed into Wal-mart.

At the time of the Wal-Mart attack, Zaid was being prosecuted in drug court for three other incidents: the Chevron crash, which prosecutors at the time did not believe was intentional; a 2012 case in which he allegedly threw a chair through the window of a Santana Row pub while high on cocaine; and a 2011 incident involving a burglary he imagined. Zaid had posted $20,000 bail after the Chevron crash. No one was hurt in the previous incidents, which all resulted in misdemeanor, not felony charges. The Chevron crash occurred just before 6 p.m. on December 16, 2012.  Zaid collided his Lexus into a vehicle at the intersection of Meridian and Hillsdale Avenues after running a red light. After a high-speed flight from the scene, he drove  into the Chevron station building. In the Easter Sunday incident in 2013, several witnesses observed a 1974 Oldsmobile Cutlass driving recklessly in an East San Jose neighborhood. At the intersection of Story and Senter Road, Zaid collided into a vehicle stopped at a red light. He continued at a high rate of speed to the Walmart parking lot off of Story Road. He sped around the crowded lanes, narrowly missing customers, and eventually collided into three occupied cars. Zaid then stopped, revved his engine and steered the Cutlass directly through the front doors of the store. As people fled, Zaid then backed his car up, stopped and again drove it further into the store – ultimately getting stuck in a tangle of shopping carts. Zaid then exited the car, swinging the metal club at people. He struck three victims before he was tackled and tied up with belts by Wal-mart customers. One victim sustained serious permanent injuries. The incident was captured on surveillance video. In all, seven people were injured in the Wal-mart incident.

(Joe Burbank/Orlando Sentinel) Rene Stutzman and Stephanie Allen Contact Reporters Privacy Policy Hundreds of law enforcement officers are searching overnight for a fugitive who is accused of killing a cop at dawn on Monday when she tried to chase him down at a Wal-Mart and arrest him. A second law-enforcement official died in a crash just hours later as officers and deputies scrambled to find the murder suspect.  By Monday evening, officers largely abandoned the apartment complex in northwest Orlando that was the focus of their search for much of the day, and Markeith Loyd, 41, was still at large. "We are going to bring this dirtbag to justice, and he's going to jail," Orlando Police Chief John Mina said. Loyd has been wanted for murder since his pregnant ex-girlfriend was shot at her front door on Dec. 13. He has a long criminal history and on Nov. 30 wrote on his Facebook page: "Goals!!!! To be on Americas most wanted." Markeith Loyd Orange County Sheriff's Office Markeith Loyd Markeith Loyd (Orange County Sheriff's Office) The manhunt prompted the lockdown of more than a dozen schools and snarled traffic for hours. “If you don’t have to be out, don’t be out,” Orange County Mayor Teresa Jacobs said Monday morning. A $60,000 reward was offered for information leading to Loyd’s capture, and both Orlando police and the Sheriff's Office described him as armed and dangerous. The violence started about 7:15 a.m. at the Wal-Mart at John Young Parkway and Princeton Street, when someone spotted Loyd, knew he was wanted for murder and told Orlando police Master Sgt. Debra Clayton, who also happened to be at the store. She was on the job, in uniform and wearing body armor, Mina said. She called dispatch, then started chasing after Loyd. OPD officer shot and killed; deputy dies in crash Orlando Police Department Debra Clayton Debra Clayton (Orlando Police Department) She yelled for him to “stop” but instead the felon opened fire. She shot back but didn’t hit him, Mina said.  Backup officers who arrived 28 seconds later tried to save Clayton with CPR, according to the city, but she was pronounced dead at 7:40 a.m. at Orlando Regional Medical Center. A short distance from the Wal-Mart, a captain at the Orange County Sheriff's Office spotted Loyd near Pine Hills Road and North Lane, according to that department. Loyd pulled into an apartment complex and fired at least once at the deputy, who was in an unmarked SUV. The bullet missed him but hit his SUV. The suspect then carjacked a vehicle and fled. He abandoned that vehicle near Cinderlane Parkway, officials said. A massive manhunt for Loyd resulted in two motorcycle crashes by Orange County deputies, one fatal.        Deputy Norman Lewis, 35, an 11-year Sheriff’s Office veteran and former football player at the University of Central Florida, was killed 2-1/2 hours after the shooting. He was traveling south on Pine Hills Road on his motorcycle when he was struck by a van turning left onto Balboa Drive, the Florida Highway Patrol said. “We’re sad on this day for many reasons," Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said at a morning news conference at the hospital. "In my 36-year career, this is possibly one of the toughest days for me." The driver of the van, Billie Jarrard of Clermont, could possibly face charges in the crash, troopers said. No one answered the phone Monday at Jarrard’s home. Records show he is a 78-year-old recent widower with no criminal history in Florida.  Ten minutes after Lewis’ crash, another deputy was involved in a wreck that sent him to the hospital. It happened just 200 yards down Pine Hills Road. Orange County Deputy Nelson Borjas, 46, had minor injuries and is expected to recover.  Officer called a hero Clayton is the first Orlando officer killed in the line of duty in a decade. The last was Al Gordon, who was shot during a robbery Oct. 4, 2007, the agency reported. Clayton, who is survived by a husband and college-age son, was one of the first officers to respond to the mass shooting at the Pulse nightclub in June that left 49 people dead and scores injured. PICTURE GALLERY: An Orlando police officer was shot on Princeton Street, just west of John Young Parkway. An Orange County deputy died in a traffic crash during the manhunt for the suspect. Mina called her a hero. “She gave her life for the community she loves." TaQueria Jones, a Wal-Mart cashier, said Clayton checked out at her register minutes before the shooting. “We talked about family, we talked about God," Jones said.  While the suspect was still at large, the cashier and others planted flowers in a spot just feet from where Clayton was killed. “I’m going to be out here every day to straighten them up. Every day," Jones vowed. Lewis, who had been with the Sheriff's Office since March 2005, was a member of the motors/DUI unit. Both Lewis and Clayton had degrees from the University of Central Florida. “They are heroes and Knights forever," UCF President John Hitt said. Deputies had been on the lookout for Loyd for weeks because of a murder warrant: He's accused of murdering his pregnant 24-year-old ex-girlfriend, Sade Dixon, on Dec. 13 and wounding her 26-year-old brother, Ronald Steward. They were shot at an Orange County home on Long Peak Drive.

(Joe Burbank/Orlando Sentinel) Loyd has a long criminal record and served 10 years in prison and five years on probation for conspiracy with intent to distribute cocaine, according to federal court records.  "To lose two law enforcement officers on this Law Enforcement Appreciation Day is indeed a tragedy,” Demings said. ... “It's a reminder that law enforcement officers put their lives on the line every single day to protect all of us." Gov. Rick Scott was in Orlando on Monday for a business meeting, but that was canceled and he joined Mina, Demings and other local officials at a morning news conference. "It breaks my heart that one of them was already senselessly killed this morning,” Scott said. Apartments focus of search On Monday, officers searched dozens of apartments, single-family homes and vehicles in the Rosemont neighborhood. Much of the search focused on the Eagle Reserve apartment complex.  An Orlando SWAT team as well as armored vehicles and a helicopter came and went twice to the complex on Cinderlane Parkway, where Loyd was last spotted by law enforcement Monday morning after the shooting. They pulled out for the second time about 6 p.m., but only after leaving some residents barred from their homes or from getting to work for several hours. Lupe Garcia and her 9-year-old son, Migul Hidalgo, were stuck outside their home for most of the day. Garcia walked to drop him off at school and came back to find her home surrounded in crime scene tape with dozens of officers holding long guns. "It's scary," she said before she was let back into the complex. After she picked her son up, they waited with dozens of others outside the complex. Migul said as he and his mom were waiting, an Orange County deputy flagged him down and asked if he was hungry. The deputy pulled out a chocolate protein bar and gave it to the boy.

(MEDIA GENERAL) — A police officer shot and killed Monday morning in Orlando was a married mother who died protecting the community she loved, according to the Orlando Police Department’s chief of police, John Mina. Master Sgt. Debra Clayton passed away about an hour after she was shot outside a Walmart in a northwest neighborhood of the city. Chief Mina said Clayton, a 17-year veteran of the force, was extremely committed to Orlando’s youth. She had a “smile and a high-five for every kid she came across,” a tweet by the department stated. They later posted a picture of a smiling Clayton standing with two young boys with the caption “THIS is how we know and remember Sergeant Debra Clayton.” THIS is how we know and remember Sergeant Debra Clayton. She always had a smile for kids and always took a moment to interact w/community. pic.twitter.com/8zL46iyUe6 — Orlando Police (@OrlandoPolice) January 9, 2017 Chief Mina said Clayton also organized several marches against violence by herself. “Debra Clayon is a hero,” he declared. “She gave her life protecting the community that she loves.

Debra Clayton was gunned down in the line of duty on Jan. 9, 2017. (Orlando Police Dept.) Related Coverage Manhunt underway for suspect in killing of Orlando officer ORLANDO, Fla. (MEDIA GENERAL) — A police officer shot and killed Monday morning in Orlando was a married mother who died protecting the community she loved, according to the Orlando Police Department’s chief of police, John Mina. Master Sgt. Debra Clayton passed away about an hour after she was shot outside a Walmart in a northwest neighborhood of the city. Chief Mina said Clayton, a 17-year veteran of the force, was extremely committed to Orlando’s youth. She had a “smile and a high-five for every kid she came across,” a tweet by the department stated. They later posted a picture of a smiling Clayton standing with two young boys with the caption “THIS is how we know and remember Sergeant Debra Clayton.” THIS is how we know and remember Sergeant Debra Clayton. She always had a smile for kids and always took a moment to interact w/community. pic.twitter.com/8zL46iyUe6 — Orlando Police (@OrlandoPolice) January 9, 2017 Chief Mina said Clayton also organized several marches against violence by herself. “Debra Clayon is a hero,” he declared. “She gave her life protecting the community that she loves. She will be deeply missed.” Master Sgt. Clayton was deeply committed to the community and to police work. pic.twitter.com/BBelv7Et1V — Orlando Police (@OrlandoPolice) January 9, 2017 The suspect in the shooting has been identified as Markeith Loyd. At the time of Clayton’s murder, Loyd, 41, was a suspect in the December murder of his pregnant ex-girlfriend. A second law enforcement officer, a deputy with the Orange County Sheriff’s Office, also died Monday. Deputy First Class Norman Lewis, an 11-year veteran, was killed in a motorcycle crash while pursing Loyd. Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer declared a day of mourning in the city, asking that the community stand united in support of officers’ families.

The suspect fled, triggering an intense manhunt that included door-to-door searches in apartment complexes and the placing of a dozen schools on lockdown. Another officer died while taking part in the search for the gunman. The Orange County sheriff’s deputy died when his motorcycle collided with another vehicle. After the deaths of two law enforcement officers in one day, Orlando Police Chief John Mina vowed to find the suspect — who has been identified as Markeith Loyd. “I’m confident we will find him,” Mina said. “It doesn’t matter where he is. We will track him down to the ends of the Earth to find him.” “To lose two law enforcement officers on this Law Enforcement Officer Appreciation Day is indeed a tragedy,” Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said. Loyd also is wanted in the killing of a pregnant woman in December, Mina said. A reward of up to $60,000 is offered for information leading to Loyd’s arrest. The officer he is suspected of shooting was identified as Orlando police Master Sgt. Debra Clayton, 42. The second officer who died in the accident was identified as Deputy First Class Norman Lewis. “To lose two law enforcement officers on this Law Enforcement Officer Appreciation Day is indeed a tragedy,” Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said. ‘He shot her down’ On Monday morning, someone at a Walmart had contacted Clayton and told her Loyd was in the area, Mina said. It appears Clayton briefly chased the suspect on foot. “As soon as she said stop, he basically opened fire on her,” the chief said. One witness told CNN affiliate WFTV he had been outside the Walmart when the shooting happened. “I was walking down the sidewalk, right past the officer, and I heard her tell him to stop, or whatever, and he shot her. He shot her down,” said James Herman. Herman said the man continued shooting behind him as he was running from the scene. He also said the man wore a security shirt, but Mina said the suspect was not a security guard. “That’s not uncommon,” he said. “We run into people in nightclubs that wear T-shirts that say FBI, police.” Clayton returned fire but investigators don’t think she struck the gunman, Mina said. Two minutes after Clayton’s last radio contact, police received a call of an officer shot. Officers performed CPR but could not revive Clayton. The pursuit After the shooting, Loyd fled in a vehicle and fired shots at another officer, police said. Hundreds of law enforcement officers descended on the area. The suspect abandoned the vehicle and carjacked a different one, police said. He ditched that second vehicle shortly after and ran into an apartment complex, Mina said. Residents were urged to stay inside and several schools were put on lockdown. By 3 p.m. ET, the lockdowns had been lifted at all the schools, the school system said on Twitter. Mina said officers searched “dozens of apartments and residences” and won’t slow down because of darkness. “I believe there have been people out there helping him all along,” Mina said. “If we find out about those people we will criminally charge them.” He said Loyd would be charged with first-degree murder of a law enforcement officer and attempted murder of the officer he fired at. Sheriff’s deputy killed As authorities scrambled to find Loyd, Deputy First Class Norman Lewis died in a crash as he was traveling on his motorcycle. “A motorist turned in front of him,” the sheriff said. “Based on eyewitness testimony, he had a green light, he was not traveling at any (high) rate of speed.” Lewis had worked 11 years with the sheriff’s department. In another incident, police said the suspect fired at an Orange County sheriff’s captain who spotted his vehicle. The captain was not seriously injured, but authorities are pursuing an attempted murder charge against the suspect. Suspect had been wanted in girlfriend’s death CNN affiliate WFTV reported that Loyd was wanted in the December 13 fatal shooting of Sade Dixon, 24, his pregnant girlfriend, outside her home in the Pine Hills neighborhood. She was the mother of a 5-year-old and a 7-year-old. Dixon’s brother, Ronald Steward, was critically injured when he tried to come to Dixon’s aid, WFTV reported, citing deputies. A hero who went above and beyond Mina said his department is grieving the death of Clayton, a 17-year veteran at the department. “I’ve known Debra for 17 years. She was extremely committed to our youth and the community. She did so many different projects in the community. She organized several marches against violence by herself,” the police chief said. Clayton was married and the mother of a college-age son. The sheriff said his department also is mourning the death of its deputy. But with an “armed and extremely dangerous” killer on the loose, there is little time to grieve. “While we’re processing our own emotional feelings, we still have a job to do,” Demings said. Clayton’s death marks the first fatal shooting of a law enforcement officer in the United States in 2017, said Steve Groeninger of the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund. The deaths of Clayton and Lewis mark the second and third on-duty law enforcement officer deaths of 2017. On Saturday, North Las Vegas police Det. Chad Parque was killed in a traffic crash.

(Joe Burbank/Orlando Sentinel) Rene Stutzman and Stephanie Allen Contact Reporters Privacy Policy Hundreds of law enforcement officers are searching overnight for a fugitive who is accused of killing a cop at dawn on Monday when she tried to chase him down at a Wal-Mart and arrest him. A second law-enforcement official died in a crash just hours later as officers and deputies scrambled to find the murder suspect.  By Monday evening, officers largely abandoned the apartment complex in northwest Orlando that was the focus of their search for much of the day, and Markeith Loyd, 41, was still at large. "We are going to bring this dirtbag to justice, and he's going to jail," Orlando Police Chief John Mina said. Loyd has been wanted for murder since his pregnant ex-girlfriend was shot at her front door on Dec. 13. He has a long criminal history and on Nov. 30 wrote on his Facebook page: "Goals!!!! To be on Americas most wanted." Markeith Loyd Orange County Sheriff's Office Markeith Loyd Markeith Loyd (Orange County Sheriff's Office) The manhunt prompted the lockdown of more than a dozen schools and snarled traffic for hours. “If you don’t have to be out, don’t be out,” Orange County Mayor Teresa Jacobs said Monday morning. A $60,000 reward was offered for information leading to Loyd’s capture, and both Orlando police and the Sheriff's Office described him as armed and dangerous. The violence started about 7:15 a.m. at the Wal-Mart at John Young Parkway and Princeton Street, when someone spotted Loyd, knew he was wanted for murder and told Orlando police Master Sgt. Debra Clayton, who also happened to be at the store. She was on the job, in uniform and wearing body armor, Mina said. She called dispatch, then started chasing after Loyd. OPD officer shot and killed; deputy dies in crash Orlando Police Department Debra Clayton Debra Clayton (Orlando Police Department) She yelled for him to “stop” but instead the felon opened fire. She shot back but didn’t hit him, Mina said.  Backup officers who arrived 28 seconds later tried to save Clayton with CPR, according to the city, but she was pronounced dead at 7:40 a.m. at Orlando Regional Medical Center. A short distance from the Wal-Mart, a captain at the Orange County Sheriff's Office spotted Loyd near Pine Hills Road and North Lane, according to that department. Loyd pulled into an apartment complex and fired at least once at the deputy, who was in an unmarked SUV. The bullet missed him but hit his SUV. The suspect then carjacked a vehicle and fled. He abandoned that vehicle near Cinderlane Parkway, officials said. A massive manhunt for Loyd resulted in two motorcycle crashes by Orange County deputies, one fatal.        Deputy Norman Lewis, 35, an 11-year Sheriff’s Office veteran and former football player at the University of Central Florida, was killed 2-1/2 hours after the shooting. He was traveling south on Pine Hills Road on his motorcycle when he was struck by a van turning left onto Balboa Drive, the Florida Highway Patrol said. “We’re sad on this day for many reasons," Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said at a morning news conference at the hospital. "In my 36-year career, this is possibly one of the toughest days for me." The driver of the van, Billie Jarrard of Clermont, could possibly face charges in the crash, troopers said. No one answered the phone Monday at Jarrard’s home. Records show he is a 78-year-old recent widower with no criminal history in Florida.  Ten minutes after Lewis’ crash, another deputy was involved in a wreck that sent him to the hospital. It happened just 200 yards down Pine Hills Road. Orange County Deputy Nelson Borjas, 46, had minor injuries and is expected to recover.  Officer called a hero Clayton is the first Orlando officer killed in the line of duty in a decade. The last was Al Gordon, who was shot during a robbery Oct. 4, 2007, the agency reported. Clayton, who is survived by a husband and college-age son, was one of the first officers to respond to the mass shooting at the Pulse nightclub in June that left 49 people dead and scores injured. PICTURE GALLERY: An Orlando police officer was shot on Princeton Street, just west of John Young Parkway. An Orange County deputy died in a traffic crash during the manhunt for the suspect. Mina called her a hero. “She gave her life for the community she loves." TaQueria Jones, a Wal-Mart cashier, said Clayton checked out at her register minutes before the shooting. “We talked about family, we talked about God," Jones said.  While the suspect was still at large, the cashier and others planted flowers in a spot just feet from where Clayton was killed. “I’m going to be out here every day to straighten them up. Every day," Jones vowed. Lewis, who had been with the Sheriff's Office since March 2005, was a member of the motors/DUI unit. Both Lewis and Clayton had degrees from the University of Central Florida. “They are heroes and Knights forever," UCF President John Hitt said. Deputies had been on the lookout for Loyd for weeks because of a murder warrant: He's accused of murdering his pregnant 24-year-old ex-girlfriend, Sade Dixon, on Dec. 13 and wounding her 26-year-old brother, Ronald Steward. They were shot at an Orange County home on Long Peak Drive.

(Joe Burbank/Orlando Sentinel) Bishop Kelvin Cobaris and Orlando commissioner Regina Hill lead a vigil  to honor the Orlando Police officer killed by an assailant at a Pine Hills Walmart, and an Orange deputy who was killed while responding to the OPD fatality, Tuesday, January 10, 2017. (Joe Burbank/Orlando Sentinel) Loyd has a long criminal record and served 10 years in prison and five years on probation for conspiracy with intent to distribute cocaine, according to federal court records.  "To lose two law enforcement officers on this Law Enforcement Appreciation Day is indeed a tragedy,” Demings said. ... “It's a reminder that law enforcement officers put their lives on the line every single day to protect all of us." Gov. Rick Scott was in Orlando on Monday for a business meeting, but that was canceled and he joined Mina, Demings and other local officials at a morning news conference. "It breaks my heart that one of them was already senselessly killed this morning,” Scott said. Apartments focus of search On Monday, officers searched dozens of apartments, single-family homes and vehicles in the Rosemont neighborhood. Much of the search focused on the Eagle Reserve apartment complex.  An Orlando SWAT team as well as armored vehicles and a helicopter came and went twice to the complex on Cinderlane Parkway, where Loyd was last spotted by law enforcement Monday morning after the shooting. They pulled out for the second time about 6 p.m., but only after leaving some residents barred from their homes or from getting to work for several hours. Lupe Garcia and her 9-year-old son, Migul Hidalgo, were stuck outside their home for most of the day. Garcia walked to drop him off at school and came back to find her home surrounded in crime scene tape with dozens of officers holding long guns. "It's scary," she said before she was let back into the complex. After she picked her son up, they waited with dozens of others outside the complex. Migul said as he and his mom were waiting, an Orange County deputy flagged him down and asked if he was hungry. The deputy pulled out a chocolate protein bar and gave it to the boy.

(AP) — The Latest on the shooting of a police officer in Orlando, Florida (all times local): 5:15 p.m. Authorities have identified the Orange County Sheriff's Office deputy who was killed in a motorcycle crash when responding to a massive manhunt for a suspect in the fatal shooting of an Orlando police sergeant. The sheriff's office said Monday that he is 35-year-old Deputy First Class Norman Lewis. Lewis was killed when his motorcycle collided with a van as he was responding to a manhunt for 41-year-old Markeith Loyd. Loyd is a suspect in the fatal shooting of Master Sgt. Debra Clayton of the Orlando Police Department. Lewis had been with the sheriff's office for 11 years and Sheriff Jerry Demings described him as "a gentle giant." The sheriff's office says he had played football for the University of Central Florida. ___ 4:05 p.m. Authorities say they've searched dozens of apartments and residences as part of a massive manhunt for a suspect in the fatal shooting of an Orlando police sergeant. Orlando Police Chief John Mina said at a news conference Monday afternoon that the focus of the manhunt was on an apartment complex in the northwest part of the metro area. Mina says authorities have probable cause to arrest 41-year-old Markeith Loyd for first-degree murder in the death of Master Sgt. Debra Clayton. Authorities say Clayton was fatally shot after she approached Loyd outside a Wal-Mart store Monday morning. He was wanted for questioning in the shooting death of his pregnant ex-girlfriend last month. Mina says Clayton returned fire but Loyd wasn't hit. The chief also says Clayton was wearing body armor. ___ 2:40 p.m. Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings is urging a suspect wanted for the murder of an Orlando police officer to turn himself in to authorities. Demings spoke Monday at a news conference held near the area in northwest metro Orlando where hundreds of officers from multiple police agencies were searching for 41-year-old Markeith Loyd. Demings says the best thing he could tell the suspect is to surrender so the situation can be resolved peacefully. Loyd is suspected in the shooting death of Master Sgt. Debra Clayton. Authorities say Clayton was shot after she approached Loyd outside a Wal-Mart store Monday morning. He was wanted for questioning in the shooting death of his pregnant ex-girlfriend last month. 11:15 a.m. Authorities say a deputy has been killed in a motorcycle crash while searching for a suspect in the shooting death of an Orlando police officer. Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings told a press conference Monday that another vehicle turned in front of the deputy, who was riding a motorcycle in pursuit of 41-year-old Markeith Loyd.

Orlando police announced the officer's death on its official Twitter account Monday morning. The shooting happened near a Walmart store in Orlando earlier Monday morning.

Accused of killing his pregnant ex-girlfriend last month, Markeith D. Loyd shot Sgt. Debra Clayton multiple times when she confronted him outside a Walmart near the Pine Hills area, police said. That wasn’t the end of the violence: A sheriff’s deputy was struck and killed by a sport-utility vehicle while responding to the shooting, and another deputy took fire while trying to stop Loyd’s presumed getaway vehicle. Hours later-as hundreds of local, state and federal officers scoured streets and apartment blocks-Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings looked into a bank of TV cameras and urged Loyd to turn himself in. “Otherwise this is going to be a very, very risky operation for all of us,” he said. The mayhem began early in the morning – apparently when a 17-year police veteran went shopping at a Walmart in the Pine Hills area. A witness told ABC affiliate WFTV that Clayton, a married mother of two, was putting her bags in her trunk when a customer walked up and told her a wanted man was inside the store. Police had been looking for Loyd since Dec. 13, the day he allegedly shot and killed his pregnant ex-girlfriend and wounded her brother, according to the Orlando Sentinel. He was considered armed and dangerous, even then. Clayton turned back toward the Walmart just as the suspect walked out, James Herman told WFTV. “I heard her tell him: Stop,” Herman said. “He shot her down and he took off running.” The suspect fired backward as he ran, the witness said. Clayton was shot twice in the chest and once in the abdomen, WFTV reported. Her heart stopped in the ambulance on the way to the hospital. Paramedics briefly revived her, but a flag-covered gurney was later wheeled out of a hospital as police officers lined up to salute it. “Oh God!!!” Orlando commissioner Regina Hill wrote on Facebook. “Please pray for my OPD Liaison. She’s been shot down in Pinehills.” In the early scramble for the suspect, an Orange County sheriff’s deputy on a motorcycle was struck by a vehicle. “He squeezed my hand. His arm was going cold,” a witness who tried to save the deputy told WFTV. “I thought he was going to make it.” The deputy died of his injuries. His name was being withheld until his family is notified. Another deputy spotted a speeding vehicle that matched the description of Loyd’s, and made a U-turn to pursue it, Sheriff Jerry Demings said at a news conference. The driver opened fire, the sheriff said, hitting the deputy’s vehicle but not harming him. According to WFTV, Loyd allegedly carjacked a vehicle and escaped again. Large swaths of the Pine Hills area were cordoned off as officers hunted for Loyd. After several hours, the Orlando Sentinel reported that SWAT police had surrounded an apartment and were calling Loyd out – rifles ready and helicopters circling. “He will be brought to justice,” Orlando Police Chief John Mina told reporters at the news conference. “I can assure the community of that.” But more hours passed with no sign of Loyd, as the searchers roved across the city. A reward for his capture was increased to $60,000, and authorities warned that anyone helping him hide would be prosecuted. Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer declared an official day of mourning. Florida Gov. Rick Scott prayed. City officials and law enforcement officers wept openly in front of TV cameras. Clayton was one of the first officers who responded to the Pulse nightclub shooting in June, arriving minutes after 911 calls came in about shots fired, according to police records. The Orlando officer appears to be the first law enforcement official fatally shot this year. Her death comes after a year that saw a surge in the number of law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty, a toll pushed upward by an increase in deadly shootings and ambush attacks. These shootings included high-profile attacks in Dallas and Baton Rouge that left a combined eight officers dead, ambushes that rattled law enforcement officers nationwide at a time of tension between police and the communities they serve. Although statistics show a steep drop in the number of line-of-duty deaths since the 1970s, officers and others in law enforcement have said in recent years that they are increasingly on edge amid protests against how police use deadly force and concerned about the public perception of police. Others have expressed concern about antigovernment attackers targeting law enforcement officers and the number of guns available on the streets. Last year, 65 police officers were killed in shootings, up from 41 the year before, according to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, a nonprofit group that monitors line-of-duty deaths. Gunfire was the common factor in nearly half of the 136 law enforcement deaths in 2016, according to the National Law Enforcement Memorial Fund, the highest percentage in more than two decades. Before 2016, it was more common in recent years for officers to die in traffic accidents than shootings. Ambushes were behind an unusually high share of these deaths, with nearly 1 in 3 officers fatally shot in such an attack. The surge in officers killed by gunfire last year was the largest on record, up 56 percent over the previous year, according to data from the memorial fund.

The suspect, identified as Markeith Loyd, was accused of murdering his pregnant ex-girlfriend last month, Fox 35 reported, adding that police had never caught him. Police hiked their reward for information on his whereabouts to $60,000. An Orlando SWAT team had surrounded an apartment complex a couple miles northwest of the Walmart around noon, demanding Loyd step outside, but eventually left. Earlier in the day, a traffic crash killed an Orange County deputy sheriff taking part in the manhunt, the sheriff announced. “We’re going to bring this dirtbag to justice,” Orlando Police Chief John Mina told reporters. “There’s going to be someone who knows where he is.” Loyd had been arrested 20 times in Orange County since 1994, according to court records. Police said the officer killed was Master Sgt. Debra Clayton, a 17-year veteran of the force and mother of two, married for one year. Officials did not identify the deputy who died. At least 64 officers were killed in gun-related incidents in 2016, a jump of more than 50 percent from the previous year, according to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund. Loyd was wearing a security uniform at the time of Monday’s shooting, a witness told WFTV. “(The shooter) was an average looking dude, he walked by me, had a security vest and everything,” witness James Herman told the station. “I was walking down the sidewalk, right past the officer, and I heard her tell him to stop, or whatever, and he shot her. He shot her down.” Police released video of the officer’s flag-draped coffin leaving Orlando Regional Medical Center. The shooting unfolded three days after the massacre at the Ft. Lauderdale airport, which left five people dead. Loyd had been on the run since Dec. 13 when police accused him of shooting and killing 24-year-old Sade Dixon, a pregnant mother of two, and critically wounding her brother, Ronald Steward, outside her home. Dixon’s surviving relatives told Fox 35 she had just broken up with Loyd. The Orange County Sheriff’s Office stated the suspect’s age as 41, but the Sentinel reported it as 43. Prosecutors reportedly had dropped drug-dealing charges against him earlier. Herman said a shopper had tipped off the officer — who was putting bags in the trunk of her vehicle — that Loyd was in the Walmart waiting to check out. As the officer walked towards the store, the suspect barged out and fired at least 12 shots, according to Herman. Three shots hit the officer, WFTV reported. After deputies launched the manhunt, the suspect pulled into a nearby apartment complex and fired shots, hitting one deputy’s unmarked SUV twice before carjacking another vehicle and escaping, Fox 35 added. Nobody was reported hurt at the apartment complex. The search also led police to the Pine Hills area a few miles west of Orlando. City Commissioner Regina Hill identified the officer as her Orlando Police Dept. liaison. The officer’s heart briefly stopped while paramedics were racing her to Orlando Regional Medical Center, rescuers said. Officials locked down more than a dozen schools in the area, and closed the Walmart. Evidence markers were spotted in the store’s parking lot. “Any act of violence against our heroes is cowardly and shameful and our state will not stand for it,” Gov. Rick Scott responded. Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer declared a day of mourning. Students and staff in the locked-down schools were safe, Fox 35 added.

The shooting occurred after 7:15 a.m. near a Walmart store in Pine Hills, which is located west of Orlando. Master Sgt. Debra Clayton, a 17-year veteran of the department, was killed in the shooting, Police Chief John Mina said. “Debra Clayton is a hero, and she gave her life to protect the community she loves,” Mina said at a Monday press conference. At least 49 dead in mass shooting at Pulse nightclub in Orlando Master Sgt. Debra Clayton (left) was killed in the shooting, and Markeith Loyd was identified as a suspect. (Orange County Sheriff's Office) Authorities identified Markeith Loyd, 41, as the shooting suspect. Loyd — wanted in connection with the December killing of his pregnant ex-girlfriend — was seen fleeing the shooting scene, the Orange County Sheriff's Office said. He fired at a deputy, who was not injured, and carjacked a vehicle before running off, the sheriff's office said in a statement. A second law enforcement officer, who has not been identified, was killed in a vehicle accident during the search for Loyd. A reward of up to $60,000 was offered for information on the suspect’s location, and the manhunt, featuring a SWAT team, focused on an apartment complex. 14 photos view gallery Massive manhunt underway after Orlando police officer is fatally shot “He will be brought to justice,” Mina said. “The community can be sure of that.” Photo captures Christina Grimmie's killer at show before shooting The circumstances surrounding the shooting weren't immediately clear. Clayton approached Loyd after she recognized him or had been tipped off to his whereabouts, police said. The gunman was wearing a security uniform when he shot the officer, a witness said.

"I was walking down the sidewalk, right past the officer, and I heard her tell him to stop, or whatever, and he shot her. He shot her down." Police officers and sheriff’s deputies escorted the ambulance to the hospital, where Clayton was later pronounced dead.

Derrick McRae, pastor of the Experience Christian Center in Orlando, attended elementary and middle school with Clayton. McRae recalled his childhood friend as calm and quiet, a good listener who never seemed to raise her voice. “You’re too nice to be a police officer,” McRae told Clayton after she joined the department. The shooting occurred outside of a Walmart store. (John Raoux/AP) “I’m going to make a change,” she responded. She did make a change in the community, McRae said, supporting numerous initiatives, including McRae’s church giving away bicycles and toys at Christmas. Clayton was one of the first responders at the June 2016 Pulse shooting, McRae said. The friends last spoke about two months ago, discussing faith. Law enforcement officials stand near the entrance to a Walmart where the officer was shot and killed. (John Raoux/AP) “Her family and friends, those who grew up with her, we’re all going to miss her, but she lived life as an example for so many others,” McRae said. Traffic was being diverted and area schools were placed on lockdown following the shooting. Loyd’s Facebook page last year featured numerous posts about his girlfriend’s pregnancy as well as workout photos. An ominous message was posted Nov. 30: “Goals!!!! To be on Americas most wanted.” He was arrested in a drug-related shooting in 1996, but first-degree murder charges were dropped after a key witness changed their story. In 2011, he was sentenced to 27 months in prison for possessing two ice pick-like homemade weapons while in federal custody. He’s also faced weapons, aggravated battery, trespassing and drug charges, according to Florida Department of Law Enforcement records.

Loyd is also accused of murdering his pregnant ex-girlfriend last month. ORLANDO, Fla. >> An Orlando police sergeant was shot and killed today after approaching a suspect wanted for questioning in the murder of his pregnant ex-girlfriend, and a second law enforcement officer was killed in a motorcycle crash while responding to a massive manhunt for the suspect. More than a dozen schools were placed in lockdown during the manhunt, and authorities were offering a $60,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of Markeith Loyd, the 41-year-old suspect wanted for the murder of Master Sgt. Debra Clayton. Officers and deputies focused their manhunt on an apartment complex in northwest Orlando, and dozens of residences had been searched. Residents who were evacuated from their homes sat on a sidewalk along a street with heavily armed officers and deputies and a parked SWAT team truck. Clayton, 42, was killed outside a Wal-Mart store in northwest Orlando early today, and an Orange County Sheriff’s Office deputy was killed in a crash while responding to a manhunt for Loyd. The deputy wasn’t identified because his family hadn’t been notified. Another Orlando police officer also was involved in a crash while responding to the shooting but only had minor injuries. Authorities said Loyd previously was a suspect in the murder of his pregnant ex-girlfriend last December. “He should be considered armed and dangerous,” Police Chief John Mina said at a morning press conference. Later in the day, the chief said, “It doesn’t matter where he is. We will track him down to the ends of the Earth.” Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said deputies had been searching unsuccessfully for Loyd for several weeks and believe he was receiving help from someone. At an afternoon news conference, Demings urged Loyd to turn himself in peacefully. “If we have to go in after him, then that jeopardizes and puts at risk the safety of law enforcement officers … and we cannot control what happens in that situation,” Demings said. Mina lauded Clayton, a 17-year veteran of the force as a “committed” officer and “a hero” who gave her life to the community she loves. The Orlando Police Department said in a tweet that Clayton always had a smile and a high five for every child she came across. Clayton had grown up in the Orlando area and was active in programs that mentored young people, Mina said. “She was always the first to step up and help kids,” the chief said. Clayton was a supervisor for a patrol division in the neighborhood where she was shot, and she previously had worked in investigations and as a school resource officer, said Deputy Chief Orlando Rolon. “She made a point, even outside her working hours, do to things for youth and do things for the community,” Rolon said. She was married and had a college-aged son. She died at 7:40 a.m., less than an hour after she was shot while on duty. Police released a video of Clayton’s body being taken out of the hospital to a waiting van in a flag-covered stretcher. A line of officers saluted as the stretcher was wheeled out. Authorities said 17 area schools were placed in lockdown following the shooting. The apartment complex that was the focus of the manhunt and shooting in northwest Orlando was nowhere near Orlando’s tourism corridor in the southern part of the metro area. “There will be a large law enforcement presence in that area until we can determine he is not there,” Mina said. Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer declared a day of mourning in the city. While at the Wal-Mart this morning, Clayton was tipped off by someone that Loyd was in the area. When she approached him, he fired multiple shots at Clayton, who was wearing body armor, Mina said. Clayton returned fire but didn’t hit him, he said. Sheriff’s officials said a deputy spotted Loyd fleeing in a vehicle. The suspect pulled into a nearby apartment complex and then fired at a deputy, striking the deputy’s SUV twice. The deputy wasn’t harmed, the sheriff’s office said. Loyd then carjacked another vehicle, drove away and then abandoned the vehicle not far away, according to the sheriff’s office. The manhunt was being conducted where he abandoned the vehicle. The Orange County Sheriff’s Office deputy was killed more than two hours after the shooting when a van collided with his motorcycle as he responded to the manhunt, authorities said. Gov. Rick Scott cancelled an appearance in Orlando because of the shooting but appeared with Orlando officials at the news conference. “I’m heartbroken and angry,” Scott said.

(AP) — A massive manhunt was underway Monday in central Florida as authorities searched for a man accused of shooting and killing an Orlando police officer. The Orlando Police Department announced the death of Master Sgt. Debra Clayton on its official Twitter account Monday morning. A short time later, authorities said at a press conference that a second law enforcement officer was killed in a vehicle accident while searching for the suspect in Clayton’s killing. The shooting occurred near a Walmart store in northwest Orlando earlier Monday.

It's been 18 years since Wal-Mart split its shares. Find out whether a split is coming this year. Dan Caplinger (TMFGalagan) Jan 9, 2017 at 9:12AM Dow component Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) revolutionized the department-store retail industry, creating new emphasis on low pricing and value. Over time, the stock's performance has also been strong, with solid performance and dividend yields that have provided income growth to investors over time as well. Yet one thing that investors haven't enjoyed in nearly two decades is a stock split from the big-box retail giant, and ongoing difficulties could make it tough for Wal-Mart to break that drought in 2017. Below, we'll look at Wal-Mart's stock split history and whether this year might finally bring an end to 18 years of going without a split. Image source: Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart stock splits in the past Here are the dates and split ratios for the stock splits that Wal-Mart has done in the past: Date of Split Split Ratio May 1971 2 for 1 March 1972 2 for 1 August 1975 2 for 1 November 1980 2 for 1 June 1982 2 for 1 June 1983 2 for 1 September 1985 2 for 1 June 1987 2 for 1 June 1990 2 for 1 February 1993 2 for 1 March 1999 2 for 1 Data source: Wal-Mart investor relations. As you can see, Wal-Mart has a long history of doing stock splits at fairly regular intervals -- until 18 years ago. Since then, those splits have come to a halt. One key element of Wal-Mart's split behavior is that the company hasn't followed some of the more typical rules in determining exactly when to do stock splits. Often, companies wait for their shares to reach triple-digit levels before splitting their shares, arguing that lower share prices are helpful for investors trying to put money to work in their stock. Yet Wal-Mart has made splits at a wide variety of prices, ranging from a low of $23 per share for its 1975 split to nearly $90 per share with its most recent split in 1999. In fact, 1999 was the only time that Wal-Mart stock had ever topped the $100 per share mark, briefly climbing above that level before the split took place. The most common range at which Wal-Mart made splits was in the $45 to $50 per share area in the 1970s and early 1980s, and the $60 to $70 per share range in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Why Wal-Mart stopped splitting its shares The basic problem that Wal-Mart has faced is that its stock hasn't performed all that well since the turn of the millennium. Its overall average annual return over the past 17 years has been just 2.3%, and that includes the dividend income that investors have received along the way. Throughout the early 2000s, the share price treaded water in the $50 to $60 range. Although the discount retailer fared quite well during the market meltdown in 2008, it nevertheless didn't participate in the rebound that ensued following the end of the financial crisis. It wasn't until early 2015 that Wal-Mart stock reached $90 per share. That had followed several years of sluggish sales performance, but once Wal-Mart stemmed the tide of same-store sales declines and started gaining ground again, some investors concluded that the company's fundamental long-term strength would finally shine through. Since then, however, Wal-Mart has fallen by as much as a third from those levels, and even now, it remains well below those previous highs from two years ago. Will Wal-Mart make a split in 2017? Looking forward, Wal-Mart faces plenty of challenges. Higher labor costs and the need to invest in its online retail presence will put demands on the company's income statement, and Wal-Mart also has to pay attention to the efforts of its brick-and-mortar rivals both in the big-box arena and among smaller-footprint dollar-store retailers. At the same time, Wal-Mart has also retained its commitment to paying strong dividends. Its current yield is almost 3%, and that puts downward pressure on the stock price that keeps it from climbing to levels that would bring suggest the need for a split. As a result, it's unlikely that Wal-Mart will do a stock split in 2017. Yet in the long run, what investors should watch more closely is whether the department store giant can regain some of the leadership that put it in its industry-dominating position in the first place. If it can, then further share-price gains will follow -- and investors won't necessarily care whether Wal-Mart splits its shares either now or in the future.

He added that she was one of the first officers to respond to the Pulse nightclub massacre on June 12.  The shooting happened just after 7:15am, as police say Clayton had been shopping in the store and was outside putting bags in the trunk of her car when someone told her that Markeith Loyd, a suspect wanted in connection with the murder of his pregnant ex-girlfriend, may have been inside the store. Scroll down for video  Orlando Police Department Master Sgt. Debra Thomas Clayton (left) died of her injuries suffered in the shooting the Pine Hills Walmart store. Markeith Loyd (right), 41, is the suspect accused in the shooting and police are still searching for him Clayton (above) was a 17-year veteran of the police department, a wife and a mother to a son. Orlando Police Chief John Mina said Clayton, 42, is a 'hero' Her flag-draped coffin (above) was removed from Orlando Regional Medical Center and was provided a police escort from the hospital Police escorted Clayton's  body from the Orlando Regional Medical Center  (above) The 17-year veteran was heading back into the store alone and had radioed in at 7:17am 'to say that she was attempting to contact a murder suspect,' Mina said.  She told the suspect to 'stop', but he immediately fired multiple shots at her before fleeing the scene, authorities said. At 7:19am, officers radioed in to say she had been shot and the first responding officers on scene began CPR on Clayton. She was pronounced dead at 7:40am at Orlando Regional Medical Center.   While trying to flee, Loyd fired at another deputy in a SUV, who was not injured. Loyd then carjacked a vehicle before getting out of the vehicle and running off, police said.  Officials said Loyd was spotted at the intersection of North Lane and Pine Hills Drive by a deputy who followed him to a nearby apartment complex.    Loyd, 41, is considered to be armed and dangerous and police are asking anyone who knows his whereabouts to please call 1-800-423-TIPS. Of Clayton (above left), Mina said: 'She gave her life to protect the community she loves.' He added that she was one of the first officers to respond to the Pulse nightclub massacre on June 12 A huge manhunt is underway for the gunman who is suspected of shooting dead Clayton near a Walmart early Monday morning (scene above) The fatal shooting happened just after 7:15am on Monday at the store located on Princeton Street and John Young Parkway (scene above) Authorities appear to be searching for him at an apartment complex near Cinderlane Parkway and Orange Blossom Trail.  Orlando police announced Monday afternoon that a reward of up to $60,000 is being offered for information leading to Loyd's arrest. 'We're going to bring this dirt-bag to justice, and he's going to jail,' Mina said of Loyd at the press conference. 'The community can be sure of that.' Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings announced during the same press conference more tragic news, as another law enforcement officer died. Demings said that the deputy was hit by a car while on his patrol motorcycle as he was working a perimeter in search for the suspected gunman. Authorities did not release the deputy's name, pending notification of his family members.  Master Sgt. Clayton was deeply committed to the community and to police work. pic.twitter.com/BBelv7Et1V— Orlando Police (@OrlandoPolice) January 9, 2017 An Orlando Police crime scene technician photographs the scene on Monday where Clayton was shot  James Herman, a witness to the shooting, said that the gunman was wearing a security uniform and fired at least 12 times at Clayton (scene above) Police and other law enforcement agencies are searching the nearby area for the suspect (above scene). He is considered to be armed and dangerous Ten minutes after that fatal crash involving the Orange County deputy, about 200 yards away OPD Officer Robert Castro was involved in a crash that sent him to the hospital with minor injuries, Mina said.  'The Orlando Police Department family is heartbroken today. One of our own was taken in the line of duty. There are no words,' the Orlando Police Department tweeted along with a video showing the Clayton's flag-draped casket being put into a vehicle, as fellow officer saluted outside of the hospital.  'I'm declaring (Monday) an official day of mourning,' Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer said.  James Herman, a witness to the shooting, told WFTV that the gunman was wearing a security uniform and fired at least 12 times at Clayton.    '(The shooter) was an average-looking dude, he walked by me, had a security vest and everything, Herman said.  Law enforcement officers hug as other officers, not seen, escort the body of the Orange County deputy that died in the line of duty on Monday Florida Gov. Rick Scott bows his head and Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings, center, salutes as the body of an unidentified OCSO deputy is transported from Orlando Regional Medical Center after the deputy was killed while responding to the Clayton's fatal shooting 'I was walking down the sidewalk, right past the officer, and I heard her tell him to stop, or whatever, and he shot her. He shot her down.'  Thirteen schools were locked down during the daytime due to the search of the suspect; but that is no longer in affect.  Aerial footage from WKMG shows several officers swarming the area, as some were spotted carrying assault rifles.  Loyd is also wanted in connection with the December shooting death of his pregnant ex-girlfriend, Sade Dixon, 24 (above) Loyd is also wanted in connection with the shooting death of his pregnant ex-girlfriend, WFTV reported.  Sade Dixon, a 24-year-old pregnant mother-of-two, was shot to death outside of her home on December 13.  Authorities say Loyd, a convicted felon who has been arrested in Orange County 20 times since 1994, has been on the run since her death.  Dixon's brother, Ronald Steward, 26, was also shot and critically injured in the incident, as he was trying to help her, police said.  Loyd has served 10 years in prison and five years probation for conspiracy with intent to distribute cocaine, according to federal court records.  Back in 1999 he was sentenced to prison and was released from probation in 2014.  A November post on his Facebook page says: 'Goals!!!!

'You can bet Walmart was tracking their sales at the stores in Thunder Bay' says Ian Lee CBC News Posted: Jan 09, 2017 7:00 AM ET Last Updated: Jan 09, 2017 7:00 AM ET Visa cards will once again be accepted at Walmart stores in Thunder Bay, Ont., after the big box retailer announced it would not allow the the cards for payment in July. (Jeff Walters/CBC) Related Stories Walmart to once again accept Visa at Thunder Bay stores Walmart to lift ban on Visa after settling of fee dispute New front open in Walmart's war with Visa, as cards will soon be banned in Manitoba 'They're going to war' — Thunder Bay, Ont., ground zero in Visa vs. Walmart fight Now that Visa and Walmart have stepped out of the ring, some experts are positing their theories on which player emerged the winner in the six-month dispute over card fees. The companies aren't saying what kind of deal was struck, but Ian Lee, an associate professor in the Sprott School of Business at Carleton University, suspects Visa came out on top. "I believe that Visa's the winner," said Lee, noting the card's popularity with consumers. "I think Walmart caved in." Visa once again accepted at Thunder Bay Walmart stores Walmart strikes deal with Visa to settle credit card fee dispute Walmart stopped accepting Visa cards at its stores in Thunder Bay, Ont. in July, and later expanded the ban to stores in Manitoba, but the promised Canada-wide roll-out of the policy never happened.  On Thursday, the two companies announced that a deal had been reached, and that Walmart would once again accept Visa at all its stores.  Lee said over the past few months, Walmart would have been watching its three Thunder Bay stores closely.  "You can bet Walmart was tracking their sales at the stores in Thunder Bay versus other stores that still accepted Visa," he said.  "And my argument — although I don't have the data, it's highly confidential — I am arguing that they suffered a loss. Their sales went down in the Thunder Bay stores that did not accept Visa." Visa has been advertising its cards on billboards across Thunder Bay, Ont. This one is located right next to the city's largest Walmart store. The two retail and credit card giants were locked in a battle over interchange fees. (Jeff Walters/CBC) Not everyone agrees that Visa must be the victor.  Steve Tissenbaum, a professor at the Ted Rogers School of Management at Ryerson University, thinks the credit card company would have had to compromise by lowering fees to some extent. The fact that they reached a resolution is good for both players, said Tissenbaum.  "I think Visa won because they kept Walmart as an account, and Walmart won because they are able to control their cost, which is really their mantra," he said.  Report Typo or Error Send Feedback To encourage thoughtful and respectful conversations, first and last names will appear with each submission to CBC/Radio-Canada's online communities (except in children and youth-oriented communities).

Updated: January 15, 2017 @ 9:20 am Full Forecast News Sports Opinion Events Obituaries Buy & Sell spotlight Who are the largest employers in the US? Jan 9, 2017 0 Some of the usual suspects make the list, including General Electric, McDonald's and Wal-Mart. However, major tech giants like Apple, Google and Amazon—which have thousands of people on their payrolls—are all absent. 1 Intro By Alex Greer Jan 3, 2017 Wal-Mart has more than 2 million employees, greater than the populations of Wyoming and Vermont combined. While some of those people work outside the U.S., it's still shocking to see a single company with such a large workforce. How does Wal-Mart stack up to the other corporate giants when it comes to employment? With that question in mind, FindTheCompany, a corporate research site by Graphiq, decided to find some of the largest employers in America. Using 2016 data from Dun & Bradstreet, the data experts ranked the companies and agencies in the U.S. with 200,000 or more employees. Employee figures reflect the number of employees who work directly for the employer, not through franchises, and include employees worldwide. In the event of a tie, companies that were founded earlier were favored. Because the federal government is overwhelmingly the largest employer in the U.S., professions under this branch were broken out into separate departments (e.g. the Department of the Treasury, the U.S. Postal Service). Additionally, FindTheCompany broke down the Department of Defense into its separate agencies. Some of the usual suspects make the list, including General Electric, McDonald's and Wal-Mart. However, major tech giants like Apple, Google and Amazon -- which have thousands of people on their payrolls -- are all absent. Note: Employment figures from Dun & Bradstreet may not be exact. 2 #44.

(Photo: AFP) Related Articles Mall monopolies keep rivals away Walmart-owned Massmart wins court battle against Pick n Pay Walmart to invest $25m in China food safety research Walmart’s UK job cuts show how Asda fell behind Walmart to test grocery delivery through Uber Walmart lifts retail shares as US stocks retreat   It’s up to retailers to adapt to these changes – and in some areas even lead the way – or they’ll fall behind and disappear, explains Walmart CEO Doug McMillon. What will shopping be like in 10 years? No one knows all the details (that’s exciting!), but one thing is for sure: it will be very different than it is today. History is clear about that. In the mid-19th century, most people in the US were shopping at small markets. They would tell the manager what they wanted, and then wait for the item to be retrieved from the back or from the supplier. After that came the urban department store, supermarkets, then strip malls and discount stores. Today, the pace of change is rapid. Ten years ago most customers were reading about the original iPhone, and wondering whether it would be useful. Now they expect to order something on their mobiles, have it delivered or pick it up in store – often on the same day, in a few hours, or even in a few minutes. It’s up to retailers to adapt to these changes – and in some areas even lead the way – or they’ll fall behind and disappear. Here’s what customers can expect their shopping experiences to be like 10 years from now: 1. Customer empowerment and even greater influence Customer satisfaction has always been the number one goal for retailers, and in the future customers will be more empowered than ever to drive the change they want, as they get more control over their shopping experience. Technology – the internet, mobile and analytics – is being used to do anything and everything a customer doesn’t want to. Customers want to explore. But they need to have easy access to items they choose to use all the time. The historic trade-off between price and service has been altered by technology and customers expect to save time and enjoy the experience while saving money. They’ll fulfill their everyday needs – items like laundry detergent, paper, light bulbs, grocery staples and shampoo – in the easiest way possible through a combination of stores, e-commerce, pick-up, delivery and supported by artificial intelligence. Customer desires – think emerging fashion, fresh produce, and items they’ve never seen before – will still be fun to explore in stores as well as with technology (think virtual reality). Retailers that provide a truly unique, enjoyable experience and prepare their associates to provide excellent service will have the advantage. At Walmart we already see the value customers place on personalisation and convenience, through our success with grocery pick-up and delivery in several markets around the world. With the growth of the internet of things, customers will enjoy an increasingly connected or “smart” shopping experience through a network of connections linking the physical and digital worlds into an ecosystem of devices, including vehicles, stores and software. The internet of things, drones, delivery robots, 3D-printing and self-driving cars will allow retailers to further automate and optimise supply chains too. Both sides of the equation – demand and supply – will change dramatically. In addition, customers will continue to demand transparency around pricing and the supply chain. They’ll have less time to research the products they buy – but they’ll care even more about how they are sourced. They’ll choose to shop with retailers who provide that transparency so they can feel good about the items they purchase. This will require retailers to work with manufacturers to source items responsibly and sustainably. Retailers who do this and share the information will further earn customers’ trust. 2. I’ve seen what you have and I want it, too Customers all over the world now know, and can see, what people in other countries have, and they want access to it all. And they want it now. Chinese customers want access to Louis Vuitton bags from France and milk from Australia. Not long ago on a visit to Nigeria and Ghana, I asked one of our local store managers what his one wish would be. His answer: “I want you to put a Walmart Supercentre like the ones you have in the US right here and let me run it. My customers and my family have seen what you have and we want it, too. We want those items at those prices.” As Tom Friedman taught us, the world got flat and now it’s moving fast. The world needs inclusive growth provided in a sustainable manner. People are demanding it. 3. Shared value With all these changes, retailers will only survive if their business creates shared value that benefits shareholders and society. Social and environmental sustainability will be engineered into our systems, and that will strengthen the communities in which we operate, which will in turn appeal to customers. These changes, however, will require new levels of cooperation and collaboration between retailers and NGOs, governments and educational institutions. Basically, we’ll design retail and other businesses so that all stakeholders (as many as possible) benefit: customers, associates/employees, shareholders, the communities we serve and those in the supply chain. At Walmart, we’ve already found that investments in training, education and wages for our associates have resulted in higher customer satisfaction. Our customers want our associates to have a great life and they want to see that reflected in their attitudes and the service they provide. When it comes to environmental sustainability, retailers and policy-makers face new challenges with the increase in packaging waste and emissions that comes with the growth of e-commerce. Shipping packages one at a time is not only wasteful and environmentally unsustainable, it isn’t cost-effective. The demand for convenience will force retailers to come up with new ways to ship items – in batches vs. one at a time –that are better for business and the environment. While all these changes pose big challenges for retailers, they also represent unprecedented opportunities to innovate on behalf of customers and create new job opportunities for retail associates. I can’t think of a more exciting time to be in retail, to be at the forefront of change and part of an industry that has the potential to provide a better life for millions around the world. * This story first appeared on the World Economic Forum Agenda website, ahead of its Davos meeting from January 17-20. * This piece draws on a new report, Shaping the Future of Retail for Consumer Industries, which can be read here.

Last week, Amazon announced that it will open its newest brick-and-mortar bookstore in New York City, while Walmart subsidiary Jet.com said it purchased online footwear retailer ShoeBuy. The Time Warner Center in Manhattan will be home to a new Amazon Books outlet, a companion to stores already operating in Seattle, Portland and San Diego. Others are planned for Illinois, New Jersey and Massachusetts. The 4,000 square foot location in New York will feature books and Amazon devices. Meanwhile, the company is running another brick-and-mortar retail experiment, Amazon Go, a concept grocery store in Seattle that offers a no-checkout experience, set to open in early 2017. While Amazon is expanding its physical presence, Walmart is strengthening its ecommerce business. Its Jet.com unit, acquired by Walmart in September 2016, purchased Shoebuy, an online footwear, clothing and accessories retailer. According to Walmart, ShoeBuy will continue to operate as a standalone site, though "Jet will gain the experience of a well-established ecommerce player in the footwear industry." Walmart expects ShoeBuy's acquisition to "bring access to a large assortment of products, strong industry relationships, and rich content that will further enhance customer experience." The moves are simply the latest signs of blurring lines in retail, and reflect consumer preference for choice. As consumers move essentially freely from physical shopping to virtual experiences, retailers are working to catch their attention in both areas. When AYTM Market Research asked US internet users how they planned to make their holiday purchases in 2016, respondents were just as likely to say they would be purchasing online as they would be in-store. Research from Market Track conducted by Qualtrics also found that US internet users were close to evenly split in how they'd primarily make their holiday purchases. Approximately 52% of respondents said they would be making most of their purchases in-store, while 45% said they'd be doing so online. Another reason why retailers are expanding their omnichannel strategies may be because omnichannel customers are simply more valuable than non-omnichannel customers. A study from Retail Systems Research found that in 2016 59% of US retailers said that omnichannel customers were more profitable. —Alison McCarthy New in eMarketer PRO This Week Forecast: US Wearables Users, 2016-2020, with Breakouts by Age, Gender and Generation Report: US Digital Ad Spending Benchmarks by Industry, H2 Update Statpack: Canada – Consumer Time and Advertiser Dollars Report: UK Digital Trends for 2017 Not a PRO subscriber?

Adam Levy (adamlevy) Jan 8, 2017 at 7:07PM Image source: Jet. Jet.com has helped reinvigorate Wal-Mart's (NYSE:WMT) online sales growth, but the megaretailer is far from done transforming its online sales operations. Wal-Mart is kicking off the year with the acquisition of ShoeBuy.com, an online shoe retailer that competes with Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) Zappos. The acquisition reportedly cost $70 million. More telling are comments from Wal-Mart's head of e-commerce, Marc Lore, (former CEO of Jet.com) who said Jet and Wal-Mart will likely pursue more acquisitions like ShoeBuy. In particular, he pointed to "categories where they are long-tail, high-margin products and harder-to-crack brands." Jet.com's selection still pales in comparison to Amazon.com's, so improving inventory through acquisition is a quick fix for the problem. Raiding the closet Apparel is the largest online sales category in the United States. It shouldn't be a huge surprise that Amazon is the largest online seller of clothing in the country -- just like nearly every other category. What's more, analysts project Amazon's share of the U.S. apparel market to triple from 2015 to 2020. While Wal-Mart sells a good amount of clothing in its brick-and-mortar stores, it doesn't crack the top 10 online apparel retailers. Thus, the ShoeBuy acquisition is a perfect fit to launch sales of the "long-tail, high-margin" categories Wal-Mart is lacking. Before Amazon bought Zappos in 2009, its apparel business was minimal. It started adding T-shirts, jeans, and other basics to its product catalog, and it rapidly grew. Amazon sold $16.3 billion in clothing and accessories in 2015, according to Internet Retailer. With the introduction of its own clothing lines, it seems like only a matter of time before Amazon surpasses Macy's as the largest overall apparel retailer in the country. While ShoeBuy isn't nearly as large as Zappos -- $315 million in revenue versus $1 billion for Zappos in 2009 -- it still gives Wal-Mart a foot in the door to more robust clothing sales sales. A big budget for improvements and acquisitions Wal-Mart plans on spending $1.1 billion on its e-commerce operations in fiscal 2018, up from $900 million this year. But Wal-Mart developed that plan before it acquired Jet.com and put Marc Lore in charge of growing its e-commerce business. If Lore wants to make more acquisitions instead of developing things internally, Wal-Mart has the capital to move some money around and make it work. Consider that ShoeBuy and its $315 million in sales only cost $70 million to acquire, Wal-Mart has room to acquire several more similarly sized companies every year. By incorporating the smaller e-tailer's inventory, retail partnerships, and operations with Wal-Mart's giant infrastructure, the company should be able to boost the bottom lines of the smaller companies it plans to snatch up. If Wal-Mart stands a chance at catching up with Amazon, it'll need to do so through both acquisitions and organic growth. Amazon is still one of the fastest-growing online retailers despite its massive sales base. Amazon's retail sales increased 27% through the first nine months of 2016.  By comparison, Wal-Mart's online sales increased just 21% in the third quarter after reporting growth of just 7% and 12% in the first and second quarters, respectively. Acquisitions like ShoeBuy to penetrate the vast apparel market or other small retailers with a small foothold in a big retail category should fit well into Wal-Mart's larger online platforms. But Wal-Mart will have to keep spending in order to grow. Adam Levy owns shares of Amazon.com. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Amazon.com. The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy.

Wasting police resource for "bears in the trash" ( Steamboat Pilot), "leaking pipes", and "I'm stuck and can't get out" should be a reason for a ticket and a fine. Maybe we could recoup some revenue by charging people for wasting the cops time. Great for a good laugh though.

FBI adds accused gunman in Orlando officer's death to most wanted list; $100K reward offered by: WFTV.com Updated: Jan 10, 2017 - 3:24 PM Twtter Law enforcement has raised the reward to $100,000 for information leading to the arrest of Markeith Loyd. >> Read more trending stories A massive manhunt for Loyd continued Tuesday, a day after an Orlando police master sergeant was shot and killed. Loyd, 41, is considered armed and dangerous.    REWARD INCREASE: There is now a $100k reward for Markeith Loyd: https://t.co/nazJUX2hry More details on #WFTVat4 pic.twitter.com/rwxHeMqDzt — WFTV Eyewitness News (@WFTV) January 10, 2017   “Any time a person guns down a law enforcement officer in broad daylight, we are going to use all resources available,“ Orlando police Chief John Mina said. Authorities said they have received many tips about Loyd's whereabouts. He is the prime suspect in the shooting death Monday of Orlando police Master Sgt. Debra Clayton outside a Pine Hills-area Walmart. Clayton, 42, died Monday morning at Orlando Regional Medical Center. Clayton's funeral will be held at the First Baptist Orlando at 3000 S John Young Parkway at 2 p.m. Saturday. "There are hundreds of officers and deputies working around the clock. There are teams of detectives assigned just to following up leads to catch Markeith Loyd. We will not stop until we find him," said Mina. WFTV.com "We are very, very optimistic that those leads will assist us today in locating (Loyd)," Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said. "So we'll just have to see how that works out." Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer declared Monday a day of mourning in memory of Clayton and senior Orange County Sheriff's Office motorcycle Deputy Norm Lewis, who died in a crash while searching for Loyd. “As in the past, I'd like to call on our entire community to stand united in support of all of the families of both the deceased and the injured. But as the sheriff and the chief have done, I am also calling on the community to provide any information that will lead to the capture of this violent criminal,” said Dyer.   Demings promised that justice would be served in Clayton and Lewis' deaths.  "We don't go home," he said. "We work 24/7, regardless of the circumstances."  Demings urged Loyd to turn himself in and warned the community to be vigilant.  Dozens of police vehicles had descended Monday on the area around the intersection of Pine Hills Road and North Lane, just south of Royal Oaks and Pineview apartments. "We have searched dozens of apartments and residences in an effort to find the suspect and bring him in. We have deployed numerous officers and detectives who specialize in looking for suspects who try and avoid capture. We are using every resource possible to find him and arrest him," Mina said. Mina said law enforcement believes that Loyd has been receiving help to stay hidden from officers.  “I am confident we will find him. I can tell you that it doesn’t matter where he is, we will track him down to the ends of the earth. Trust me on that,“ Mina said. Demings warned anyone who is helping Loyd, that they should "stand ready to be charged yourself." Aside from the legal consequences, individuals who help Loyd are putting themselves in serious danger, Demings said. "They are imperiling themselves, because he's a dangerous individual, and we certainly want to be able to peacefully take him into custody, but if we're not able to do that, you don't want to be anywhere around that," he said.  Clayton was outside the Walmart when she was approached by a shopper.  "The customer walked up to her and said that someone they were looking for, wanted, was in the store in the line to check out," a witness said said. "She went in there, I guess, to confront him. As she was going back to Walmart, he was coming out, and he shot her." An Orange County sheriff's deputy spotted Loyd at the intersection of North Lane and Pine Hills Drive and followed him to a nearby apartment complex, officials said.  The man shot at the deputy, hitting his unmarked SUV twice, and then carjacked a second vehicle and continued to flee, the Orange County Sheriff's Office said. He abandoned the vehicle near the intersection of Rosemont Avenue and Cinderlane Parkway and ran, deputies said.  Clayton, a mother and a 17-year veteran of the force, was carried out from ORMC Monday in a flag-draped coffin and was driven from the hospital, accompanied by a police escort. "We were certainly sad yesterday," Demings said Tuesday. "That was probably one of the saddest  moments that most of us will ever experience in our careers. But by the same token, because one of our loved ones was taken away so quickly yesterday, it helps to motivate us to get out today (and) to do our jobs." Loyd is a convicted felon and he has been arrested in Orange County 20 times since 1994, court records said. Authorities said Loyd was also wanted in connection with the shooting death of his pregnant ex-girlfriend, Sade Dixon. He has been on the run since Dec. 13, when Dixon, 24, was shot to death outside her home in the 6000 block of Long Peak Drive.  Dixon's brother, Ronald Steward, was also shot and critically injured when he tried to come to her aid, investigators said. © 2017 Cox Media Group.

Authorities advised that arrest warrants were being prepared for people who may have helped 41-year-old Markeith Loyd evade deputies in the past month as they searched for him for questioning in the murder of his pregnant ex-girlfriend in December. Master Sgt. Debra Clayton was fatally shot Monday morning after she approached Loyd in the parking lot of a Wal-Mart store in northwest Orlando. Many of her colleagues immediately joined the pursuit; among them was a sheriff’s deputy who died when he was thrown from his motorcycle in an accident. More than 300 tips from the public have been made, said Barb Bergin, executive director of Crimeline, the tip-line service which is offering the reward, originally set for $60,000. “We have never burned or harmed a tipster. They are kept anonymous,” Bergin said in a plea for more tips. “We will not identify you. We just need to know where he is so no one else is hurt.” Orange County Sheriff’s Office deputies in metro Orlando had been looking for Loyd since his ex-girlfriend was murdered last December. “Certainly it’s upsetting he was out and about and killed Debra Clayton, our first homicide in the city of Orlando this year, one of the officers protecting our community,” said Mina. Orlando Police confirmed that Clayton was one of the officers who responded to the shooting at Pulse nightclub in which 49 patrons were killed. Last June’s massacre in Orlando was the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Clayton, who was married and has a college-aged son, also was known for her mentoring of young people and her involvement in the community in which she had grown up. In the Wal-Mart parking lot Tuesday morning, shoppers laid more than two dozen bouquets of flowers, teddy bears and candles in a makeshift memorial. Some shoppers, like Hal Shore, stopped to say a prayer or take a photo. “It’s important that the country is aware that there is a war against police officers,” said Shore, a cabinet maker. An apartment complex that was the focus of the manhunt Monday afternoon didn’t appear to have any police searches going on Tuesday morning. Some front doors were boarded up from being kicked in Monday because residents weren’t home when authorities came knocking. “I’m confident he is gone,” said Ida Seck, a resident who had worked with Clayton in her job as a security officer at Universal Orlando Resort. “For things like this to happen, yeah I’m scared for safety and my son’s safety but really there is nothing you can do.” Court documents show Loyd’s criminal record goes back two decades. He was arrested in 1996 on a murder charge that was later dropped. Loyd was arrested for battery on an officer in 1998 and sentenced to more than four years in prison. While behind bars, he pleaded guilty to cocaine possession from a prior case and was transferred to federal prison before being released in July 2014, according to federal records. An Orange County Sheriff’s Office deputy was killed more than two hours after Monday’s shooting when a van collided with his motorcycle as he responded to the manhunt. Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings described the 35-year-old Norman Lewis as “a gentle giant,” and the sheriff’s office said he had played football for the University of Central Florida before joining the agency 11 years ago. Funerals were planned for Lewis for Friday and Clayton for Saturday. Recommended for You Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings and Orlando Police Chief John Mina were also at the news conference. Demings said agencies are working together to get arrest warrants signed for people accused of helping Loyd avoid capture since December. Mina said authorities wouldn't discuss any details on where they think Loyd might be. "We want the community to know that it's safe to go about their day-to-day activities," Mina said, adding that anyone coming across law enforcement activity should avoid the area. Anyone with information on Loyd's location is asked to call Crimeline at 1-800-423-TIPS (8477). The reward for information is $100,000.

Orlando Police teams have searched hundreds of apartments at the complex, Mina said. SWAT team members are at the scene — News 13 will not reveal any of their tactical locations for their safety. Tim Arnold lives in the apartment complex and was told by authorities to remain inside. “About 8 o’clock in the morning, I opened my back blind and I saw every cop on Earth that couldn’t get in on Cinderlane Parkway with assault rifles,” Arnold said. “I've never seen so many assault rifles in my life, not even in Lethal Weapon movies.” Other residents were reassured by the law enforcement presence. “They were polite, they were very polite. And they just wanted to search the apartment, and they checked everything to make sure he wasn’t hiding in the area, but they didn’t find anything,” Loretha Chandler said. “I’m not afraid. I would sleep on my porch tonight if I wanted to. ... They were walking around here all night long. I’m not afraid,” Arnold said. Funeral information The funeral for Orange County Sheriff's Office Deputy First Class Norman Lewis will be at 11 a.m. Friday, Jan. 13, at First Baptist Church of Orlando, 3000 S. John Young Parkway. There will also be a funeral service in Port Charlotte, which is Lewis' hometown. A day later, the funeral for Orlando Police Master Sgt. Debra Clayton will be 2 p.m. Saturday, also at First Baptist Church of Orlando. An official GoFundMe page has been set up to help Clayton's family.

Debra Clayton on Monday. On Tuesday morning, Clayton's patrol vehicle was parked outside Orlando Police Department headquarters in her honor. Master Sergeant Debra Clayton's patrol vehicle will remain outside of OPD HQ for now. pic.twitter.com/bNR1BdBnqs — Orlando Police (@OrlandoPolice) January 10, 2017 A candlelight vigil was held for the law enforcement officers at the Wal-Mart on Princeton Street, where Clayton was fatally shot. It all started just after 7 a.m. Monday, when the 43-year-old Clayton tried to make contact with Loyd at the Wal-Mart when he allegedly shot her, police said. Clayton, a 17-year veteran with the Orlando Police Department, was able to return fire, but it is not thought that Loyd, 41, was hit. After the Wal-Mart shooting, Loyd was spotted in a vehicle on North Lane and Pine Hills Drive by a Sheriff's Office deputy. When Loyd pulled into the apartment complex, he allegedly shot at the deputy and also struck his unmarked Sheriff's Office vehicle twice, officials said. The deputy was not injured. &amp;amp;amp;nbsp; Clayton was not the only fatality Monday. Orange County Sheriff's Office motorcycle deputy Norman Lewis was involved in a crash with a minivan on Balboa Drive and Pine Hills Road while he was involved with the manhunt. The minivan's driver pulled into the path of 35-year-old Lewis' motorcycle, according to troopers. Lewis was taken to Orlando Regional Medical Center in critical condition, officials said, where he died. Charges are pending against 78-year-old Billie Jarrard, the minivan's driver, Florida Highway Patrol Sgt. Kim Montes said. On Tuesday, there were flowers at the intersection where Lewis lost his life. The manhunt caused more than two dozen public and private schools to be placed on lockdown during the search for Loyd, who is also accused in the December shooting death of his pregnant ex-girlfriend, Sade Dixon, 24. According to investigators, Dixon was three months' pregnant, broken up with Loyd and living with her parents when Loyd came to the family's front door late Dec. 13. That’s when police say he shot and killed Dixon and turned the gun on her 26-year-old brother, Ronald Stewart, who was trying to help her. Stewart's family said Tuesday that he is still hospitalized after being shot five times in almost every limb and the chest. Officials describe Loyd as armed and dangerous and warned the public not to approach him but to call 911 immediately.

Markeith Loyd, 41, apparently posted on Facebook last month that he wanted his face on one of America’s most popular crime shows. “Goals!!!! To be on Americas most wanted,” a November 2016 post page read. A separate post from December was addressed to the city of Orlando: “When you talk about street legends mention ME!!!!! Me!!!!” “We are all focused on bringing Markeith Loyd to justice. We are working on having arrest warrants signed for those who have have aided him,” Orlando police said Tuesday. The reward on Monday for information into his whereabouts was $60,000. Loyd already had a long rap sheet and murder accusation to his name before police said he shot and killed an officer who confronted him outside a Walmart in Orlando on Monday. Law enforcement agencies ramped up their manhunt immediately, but signs of Loyd were few and far between. The manhunt itself led to the death of a sheriff’s deputy in a motorcycle crash and the injury of another officer. “There was a bunch of chaos, a bunch of people running, yelling, and screaming, all confused, confused as to where to go, what to do and how do to get out of there,” one witness named Chris, who did not give a last name, told Fox 35. Loyd’s December Facebook post appeared one day before investigators said he shot and killed his pregnant ex-girlfriend, and critically wounded her brother, outside her home. After that, police said he took off — and he went silent on social media. “He should be considered armed and dangerous,” Police Chief John Mina said. Later in the day, the chief said, “It doesn’t matter where he is. We will track him down to the ends of the Earth.” Loyd served 10 years behind bars, and five years probation, for conspiracy with intent to distribute cocaine, the Orlando Sentinel reported. He also did nearly four years for battery on a law enforcement officer — and was found guilty later for punching a jail officer who demanded he get off the phone for mealtime, according to the newspaper. In 1996, back when he was 21, Loyd faced murder charges, which prosecutors ultimately dropped after a teenaged witness admitted she lied. At the time, investigators said Loyd and three other people wanted drugs from the man who turned up dead. While pictures of Loyd have spread across social media, appearing on “America’s Most Wanted” seems less feasible. The show, once a mainstay on Fox TV, has not aired since 2013. Master Sgt. Debra Clayton, 42, was killed outside the Walmart in northwest Orlando early Monday, and Orange County Sheriff’s Office Deputy 1st Class Norman Lewis was killed more than two hours later in a crash while responding to the manhunt. Another Orlando police officer was involved in a crash while responding to the shooting but had only minor injuries. Mina lauded Clayton, a 17-year veteran of the force,  as a committed officer and a hero who gave her life to the community she loves. The Orlando Police Department said in a tweet that Clayton always had a smile and a high five for every child she came across. The deaths left Orlando’s law enforcement community in mourning. Clayton’s patrol SUV was displayed in front of Orlando Police headquarters Tuesday morning. The police department also started an online fund to raise money for her family. In the Walmart parking lot Tuesday morning, shoppers laid more than two dozen bouquets of flowers, teddy bears and candles in a makeshift memorial. Some shoppers, like Hal Shore, stopped to say a prayer or take a photo. “It’s important that the country is aware that there is a war against police officers,” said Shore, a cabinet maker. While at the Walmart on Monday morning, Clayton was tipped off by someone that Loyd was in the area. When she approached him, he fired multiple shots at Clayton, who was wearing body armor, Mina said. Clayton returned fire but didn’t hit him, he said. Sheriff’s officials said a deputy spotted Loyd driving off. The suspect pulled into a nearby apartment complex and then fired at a deputy, striking the deputy’s SUV twice. The deputy wasn’t harmed, the sheriff’s office said. Loyd then carjacked another vehicle, drove away and then abandoned the vehicle not far away, according to the sheriff’s office.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    Wal-Mart Stores Inc. plans to cut hundreds of jobs before the end of January, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the situation. The Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer plans to eliminate jobs at its headquarters and regional personnel that support stores, according to the report. Many of the eliminations will affect Wal-Mart's human resources department, a large team that some senior executives believe should be more efficient or whose duties could be handled by outside consultants, the newspaper reported. Other departments could be affected as well, the report said. "While we continually look at our corporate structure, we have not made any announcements," Wal-Mart spokesman Randy Hargrove said in an email. The company said in September it would cut about 7,000 back-office jobs, mostly in accounting and invoicing positions at its U.S. stores, as part of a program it announced in June. The job cuts followed the company's plans to invest $2.7 billion in programs that involve training its workforce and a series of wage hikes that took the minimum hourly pay for store workers to $10, part of efforts to improve service at stores and boost sales. The company has also been investing to increase e-commerce sales and improve stores. These measures helped the company report strong online sales growth and a smaller-than-expected decline in earnings for the third quarter despite comparable store sales coming in below estimates. Wal-Mart's shares were down marginally at $68.48 in afternoon trading. © 2017 Thomson/Reuters. All rights reserved. Click Here to comment on this article Close  More ways to share...

Sarah Nassauer 5 days ago SHARE SHARE TWEET SHARE EMAIL How to prepare for 2017 Social Security changes 21 expensive products that cost way more than they should Wal-Mart Stores Inc. is preparing another round of job cuts at its headquarters before the end of the month, according to people familiar with the situation. The world’s biggest retailer plans to eliminate hundreds of jobs before the end of its fiscal year on Jan. 31, both at headquarters and regional personnel that supports stores, these people said. Many of the eliminations will affect Wal-Mart’s human resources department, a large team that some senior executives believe should be more efficient or whose duties could be handled by outside consultants, said these people. Other departments could be affected as well, say these people. “We are always looking for ways to operate more efficiently and effectively,” said Wal-Mart spokesman Greg Hitt. “While we continually look at our corporate structure, we have not made any announcements.” The company has been cutting jobs to preserve profits while investing billions to boost e-commerce sales, improve stores and raise wages for store employees. In late 2015 Wal-Mart laid off hundreds of workers in its Bentonville, Ark., headquarters. In September, it cut about 7,000 back-office jobs in its stores, automating some tasks by adding cash recyclers that count money. “We need to manage expenses even better, which includes changing how we do work inside the company,” Chief Executive Doug McMillon said during an investor presentation in October. Wal-Mart has predicted that per-share adjusted earnings in fiscal 2018 will be flat compared with fiscal 2017, then fall at the low end of its 2019 target of 5% to 10% growth. Other retailers have recently moved to slash jobs and close stores as they battle sluggish sales and try to save money to invest in their e-commerce efforts. Last week, Macy’s Inc. said it would close stores, cutting 10,000 jobs and streamlining operations. Wal-Mart closed more than 150 U.S. stores last January, then in October said new-store openings would slow, but hasn’t announced plans for another round of large-scale closures. In late 2015, Wal-Mart hired Jacqui Canney, an executive who had spent decades with Accenture Ltd., to lead its human-resources department. Some employees in the department have been told to find other jobs internally or externally by the end of the month, said one of the people familiar with the situation. In total, the planned job cuts will affect a small percentage of Wal-Mart’s roughly 18,000 Bentonville-based staff. But the series of reductions show how the retailer is working to maintain profits at a time of change in the industry. Wal-Mart has spent heavily over the past two years to fend off Amazon.com Inc. and smaller, fast-growing discounters like Aldi. In the investor presentation last fall, executives said Wal-Mart would steer more of its $11 billion in annual budget toward boosting e-commerce sales, technology used in stores and on customer services. In September, Wal-Mart spent $3.3 billion to purchase Jet.com Inc., an unprofitable e-commerce startup. “We have a plan to win with customers and drive growth. We will be disciplined with our cost and capital as we do it,” said Mr. McMillon during the presentation.

The layoffs were first reported by the Wall Street Journal. The cuts would affect both regional workers and employees at the company's headquarters, sources told the Journal. They added that many of the layoffs will impact its human resources department. In a statement to CNBC, Wal-Mart said, "As we've previously shared, we are always looking for ways to operate more efficiently and effectively. While we continually look at our corporate structure, we have not made any announcements." The move marks the latest in a series of cuts as the retailer pares some expenses. In September, it said it would slash 7,000 back-office jobs while it said in October 2015 that it was cutting hundreds of positions at headquarters. —CNBC's Courtney Reagan contributed to this report.

(WDRB) -- The officer who resigned from the Clarksville Police Department plans to take full responsibility for shoplifting from Walmart, according to his lawyer, but he's not pleading guilty. Mike Popplewell made his first court appearance Tuesday morning on three theft charges. Court records say that on Black Friday weekend, Popplewell is seen on surveillance video stealing a Fitbit, then returning it. He's also accused of taking toys and jewelry from the Walmart on Veterans Parkway. Popplewell was freelancing as a security officer for the store. Last month he resigned from the Clarksville Police Department, and last week gave up his seat on the Clark County Council. "He realized what he did was wrong, so I would suggest right now Michael Popplewell's penalty and punishment for what he did far exceeds what a normal person would expect, because what he's done is he's, on his own volition, given up a career," said attorney Larry Wilder. Popplewell did not plead guilty this morning, but he plans to put up no defense.  "People make bad, bad decisions -- and there's not a lot of reasons why it happens sometimes," Wilder said. "He just got up one morning and made a bad decision." But will Popplewell's more recent decisions get him leniency for the crime? Prosecutor Jeremy Mull says no, though jail time is not likely.  "I want the public to understand that this matter will be treated like all other matters similar to this," Mull said, before adding that, "many times in these cases, if it is the first offense -- shoplifting with no criminal history -- my office would offer a pre-trial diversion, or an offer of misdemeanor probation." But Tuesday brought no resolution to the case. Popplewell is so familiar in the community and courtroom circles -- he even served as a resource officer for Clarksville Community Schools -- that Judge Joseph Weber had to recuse himself from the case. When asked why the former officer didn't just plead guilty, Wilder had one answer. "Because smart lawyers and good lawyers don't let clients do what they want to do." The state will appoint a new judge from outside Clark County. Popplewell is due in court again next month. Copyright 2017 by WDRB News. All rights reserved.

Mac Naughton is taking over that role from Gary Philbin, who has been promoted to enterprise president of Dollar Tree. Philbin oversaw the development of strategic initiatives and the successful achievement of budgetary, synergy, and transition goals following Dollar Tree's acquisition of Family Dollar in July 2015. In a statement, Philbin said Mac Naughton “will be instrumental in continuing to develop and improve the Family Dollar banner through an intense focus on the customer.” Mac Naughton, 54, most recently served as CEO of Mills Fleet Farm, a 36-store discount retailer based in Appleton, Wisc. He has held numerous leadership roles at Wal-Mart Stores including chief merchandising officer for Walmart US from 2011-2014; EVP of consumables, health and wellness and Walmart.com from 2010 to 2011 and chief merchandising officer at Walmart Canada from 2009 to 2010. Prior to his experience at Walmart, Mac Naughton served as Supervalu’s president of merchandising and marketing. In his new role, Philbin’s responsibilities will include store operations, merchandising, marketing and real estate across all banners including Dollar Tree, Family Dollar and Dollar Tree Canada. He will continue to report to Bob Sasser, CEO. Mills Fleet Farm, which operates discount variety stores that sell sporting goods, farm equipment and auto accessories in the Upper Midwest, said Mac Naughton would be succeeded by Wayne Sales as interim CEO. Sales currently serves on Mills Fleet’s board of directors. From 2012 to 2013, Sales served as chairman, CEO and president of Supervalu.

Debra Clayton (l.) was shot and killed outside of a Walmart Monday. Police are still searching for accused gunman Markeith Loyd (r.) (ORANGE COUNTY SHERIFF’S OFFICE) Markeith Loyd, 41, is armed and dangerous, according to reports. A Florida fugitive and felon, Loyd is a suspect in the December murder of his pregnant girlfriend, Sade Dixon, 24. She was shot at the front door of her home located in West Orange County on Dec. 3, 2016. Her brother Ronald Steward, 26, was also wounded in the December gun attack. On Nov. 30, Loyd wrote on his Facebook page, “Goals!!!! To be on Americas most wanted.” He’s achieved that sordid goal. Hundreds of law enforcement officers scoured Orlando overnight looking for the madman. On Monday, Jan. 9, 2017, Loyd opened fire on Orlando Master Sgt. Debra Clayton just after 7 a.m. after she recognized him as a wanted murder suspect. She confronted him, yelled for him to “stop.” Instead, he opened fire. She returned fire but missed. Clayton was on duty, in uniform and wearing body armor when she started chasing Loyd. Backup officers who arrived 28 seconds later tried to save Clayton with CPR, according to the city, but she was pronounced dead at 7:40 a.m. at Orlando Regional Medical Center. The Orange County Sheriff’s Office reported he fired at a deputy, who was not injured, and carjacked a vehicle before running off. Orange County Sheriff’s Office Deputy First Class Norman Lewis was killed in a motorcycle crash during the manhunt. (ORANGE COUNTY SHERIFF’S OFFICE) A second law enforcement officer, deputy Norman Lewis, 35, an 11-year Sheriff’s Office veteran and former football player at the University of Central Florida, was killed 2.5 hours after the shooting. He was responding to the call, traveling on his motorcycle when he was struck by a van, the Florida Highway Patrol said. A reward of up to $60K was offered for information on the suspect’s location, and the manhunt, featuring a SWAT team, focused on an apartment complex.

(AP Photo/John Raoux) By MIKE SCHNEIDER and TERRANCE HARRIS The Associated Press ORLANDO, Fla. — Authorities raised to $100,000 the reward for information leading to the arrest of a suspect in the fatal shooting of an Orlando police sergeant on Tuesday as he eluded hundreds of officers on the second day of a massive manhunt. Authorities advised that arrest warrants were being prepared for people who may have helped 41-year-old Markeith Loyd evade deputies in the past month as they searched for him for questioning in the slaying of his pregnant ex-girlfriend in December. Master Sgt. Debra Clayton was fatally shot Monday morning after she approached Loyd in the parking lot of a Wal-Mart store in northwest Orlando. Many of her colleagues immediately joined the pursuit; among them was a sheriff's deputy who died when he was thrown from his motorcycle in an accident. More than 300 tips from the public have been made, said Barb Bergin, executive director of Crimeline, the tip-line service which is offering the reward, originally set for $60,000. "We have never burned or harmed a tipster. They are kept anonymous," Bergin said in a plea for more tips. "We will not identify you. We just need to know where he is so no one else is hurt." Orange County Sheriff's Office deputies in metro Orlando had been looking for Loyd since his ex-girlfriend was killed. "Certainly it's upsetting he was out and about and killed Debra Clayton, our first homicide in the city of Orlando this year, one of the officers protecting our community," said Mina. Orlando Police confirmed that Clayton was one of the officers who responded to the shooting at Pulse nightclub in which 49 patrons were killed. Last June's massacre in Orlando was the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Clayton, who was married and has a college-aged son, also was known for her mentoring of young people and her involvement in the community in which she had grown up. In the Wal-Mart parking lot Tuesday morning, shoppers laid more than two dozen bouquets of flowers, teddy bears and candles in a makeshift memorial. Some shoppers, like Hal Shore, stopped to say a prayer or take a photo. "It's important that the country is aware that there is a war against police officers," said Shore, a cabinet maker. An apartment complex that was the focus of the manhunt Monday afternoon didn't appear to have any police searches going on Tuesday morning. Some front doors were boarded up from being kicked in Monday because residents weren't home when authorities came knocking. "I'm confident he is gone," said Ida Seck, a resident who had worked with Clayton in her job as a security officer at Universal Orlando Resort. "For things like this to happen, yeah I'm scared for safety and my son's safety but really there is nothing you can do." Court documents show Loyd's criminal record goes back two decades. He was arrested in 1996 on a murder charge that was later dropped. Loyd was arrested for battery on an officer in 1998 and sentenced to more than four years in prison. While behind bars, he pleaded guilty to cocaine possession from a prior case and was transferred to federal prison before being released in July 2014, according to federal records. More recently, his wife whom he is in the process of divorcing, had filed a request for a temporary injunction against him in 2015, and he followed with a similar request against her three days later. Both requests were eventually dismissed in court. He also had paternity suits from three different women filed against him. His Facebook profile had videos of him working out at a gym and hanging out at a nightclub. He said in a November post, "Goals!!!! To be on Americas (sic) most wanted," followed by a series of laughing-with-tears emojis. An Orange County Sheriff's Office deputy was killed more than two hours after Monday's shooting when a van collided with his motorcycle as he responded to the manhunt. Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings described the 35-year-old Norman Lewis as "a gentle giant," and the sheriff's office said he had played football for the University of Central Florida before joining the agency 11 years ago. Funerals were planned for Lewis for Friday and Clayton for Saturday.

Hundreds of law enforcement officers scoured Orlando overnight looking for Markeith Loyd, who has been on the run since the Monday morning shooting in front of an Orlando Walmart. He is armed and dangerous, police said. Loyd, 41, opened fire on Orlando Master Sgt. Debra Clayton just after 7 a.m. when she confronted him outside the megastore, police said. She was on duty and in uniform, and started chasing Loyd when someone at the store recognized him as the wanted suspect in the December murder of his pregnant girlfriend, the Orlando Sentinel reported.

Loyd is wanted for allegedly fatally shooting his 24-year-old pregnant girlfriend, Sade Dixon, in December. Her brother, 26-year-old Ronald Steward, was also wounded in the December gun attack. Police said they have received more than 300 tips since Monday, and more than $16,000 has been raised on a GoFundMe page for Clayton's family.

(Joe Burbank/Orlando Sentinel) By Stephanie Allen Staff Writer Suspect in cop killing remains elusive; funerals for victims planned. Privacy Policy The suspect in the fatal shooting of Orlando police Master Sgt. Debra Clayton remains elusive, even as hundreds of tips have come in and law enforcement from local, state and federal agencies work nonstop to find him. Officials are hoping a reward of $100,000 — increased from $60,000 on Monday — will be enough of a lure to help them capture Markeith Loyd, a felon who is accused of killing Clayton on Monday outside a Wal-Mart on Princeton Street at John Young Parkway. "We'll get him," Orlando Police Chief John Mina said Tuesday. "It's only a matter of time." PICTURE GALLERY: An Orlando police officer was shot on Princeton Street, just west of John Young Parkway. An Orange County deputy died in a traffic crash during the manhunt for the suspect. At a news conference with Mina and Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings on Tuesday, Barb Bergin, the executive director of Crimeline, wanted to make one thing clear: If you provide information, you will not be identified, and anonymous callers are still eligible for the reward. "Please understand, when we say anonymous, they are truly anonymous," Bergin said. "We will not identify you. We just need to know where he's at so that no one else is hurt." More than 300 tips have come in since the Monday morning shooting, Bergin said. In a typical month, the crime line usually gets 1,000. Two tips led law-enforcement officers and SWAT members to south Lake County on Tuesday.

(David Harris) Orange County sheriff's deputies and SWAT members conducted a knock-and-talk early Tuesday at a residence in the Tradd's Landing neighborhood on U.S. 27, south of Clermont. The woman at the residence consented to a full search of her property with SWAT. Loyd was not there. "The neighborhood [was] saturated with undercover officers" for several hours, said Lt. John Herrell, a spokesman for the Sheriff's office. On Tuesday evening, law enforcement searched a house in the Groveland area, just west of Clermont, with that owner's consent. Again, there was no sign of Loyd. Funerals are being planned for Clayton and Orange County Sheriff's Deputy Norman Lewis, who died in a crash just two hours after Clayton was shot while he was responding to the incident.

Clayton's funeral service is at 2 p.m. Saturday at the same church. A GoFundMe page has been set up for Clayton's family, police confirmed. By Tuesday evening, the fund had raised more than $20,000. Authorities have been searching for Loyd, 41, since Dec. 13, when his pregnant ex-girlfriend, 24-year-old Sade Dixon, was shot and killed on her doorstep. Loyd also is accused of shooting and injuring Dixon's brother when he ran to help her. "There have been times when we just missed him," Demings said.

(Shannon Green) In a Facebook Live video posted on Loyd's page on Nov. 4 — a little more than a month before Dixon was shot and killed — Loyd and Dixon talk about killing cops during a traffic stop. "Go ahead and kill him, babe, so we can get home faster," Dixon said. On Monday, Clayton was in Wal-Mart about 7:15 a.m. when a shopper flagged her down and told her Loyd was in the store. Clayton, 42, called for backup to the store and then spotted Loyd. She started chasing him and yelled for him to "stop," but instead, the felon opened fire, Mina said.

(David Harris) On Tuesday afternoon, Mina said Clayton did the right thing. "This whole incident happened within seconds," Mina said. "I think she's a hero. She did a phenomenal job. I wouldn't have done anything differently myself." Loyd fled after the shooting but was soon spotted by an Orange County sheriff's deputy near Pine Hills Road and North Lane, officials said. Loyd fired at least once at the deputy, striking his cruiser, and then carjacked a woman and sped away, according to police. He eventually ditched the car at an apartment complex off Cinderlane Parkway in the Rosemont area of Orlando. That complex, where police focused their search efforts most of Monday, was mostly quiet and empty Tuesday afternoon. Maintenance crews were seen repairing boarded-up doors and windows that had been damaged by a SWAT team. An armed security guard was thwarting media attempts to get on the property.

He said he left home Monday shortly after the SWAT team descend on the complex and came back hours later to find his door was one of more than a handful that had been boarded up. The frame was busted and Orlando fire crews were called to his unit Tuesday morning after the gas smell made a maintenance man dizzy. Mike said he never gave police permission to go inside -- or break his door -- but found a copy of a search warrant inside that mentioned Loyd was seen walking past the door. "I don't know where this cat is," Mike said. "I just want my house fixed back up." Detectives also are looking for people who have helped Loyd elude law enforcement and they're "fairly certain" they've identified a few, Demings said. As the search for Loyd continues, Mina said that if anyone sees a large police presence, they should avoid it. He would not say what areas officers are focusing on or if investigators think Loyd is still in Central Florida. "We want the community to know it's safe to go about their day-to-day activities," Mina said at the news conference.

Yet Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) has been able to buck the trend. Then again, the company has massive scale and has also been investing aggressively in its e-commerce platform. As a result, Walmart stock has logged a decent 7% return during the past 12 months. Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr So might there be more gains? Well, for the most part, there are still major headwinds – and one is downright tough to gauge. That is, Donald Trump’s trade policies. So far, it looks like there could be a tariff of 5% to 10% on imports, which could be done fairly quickly with an executive action. The goal is to help spur manufacturing and promote an “America first” policy. But it will likely make Walmart stock far from first. According to InvestorPlace.com’s James Brumley, the company imports about $50 billion in Chinese goods. While a tariff of 5% to 10% may not seem like a lot, it could still come to $5 billion. This leaves WMT in a tough position, such as to make a decision on raising prices or take a hit on margins. And of course, the company’s margins are already razor-thin, with the net income representing about 3% of overall revenues. 7 Cheap Stocks to Buy That Could Double in 2017 It is not clear-cut if anything will happen, however. Let’s face it, the Republican party has a long history of being pro free-trade. So there will likely be considerable pushback. Oh, and there are many U.S. companies that will ramp up their lobbying efforts. Regardless, all this uncertainty will probably be a negative for Walmart stock. If anything, expect lots of headlines that will cause anxiety for investors. Other Problems With Walmart Yet this is not the only nagging issue with Walmart stock. Keep in mind that growth has been lackluster. From 2012 to 2016, there was a mere 8% increase. Furthermore, during this period WMT was only able to churn out a gain of 16%. By comparison, Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) logged a return of 47% and Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) posted nearly a 100% increase. Part of the problem for WMT is that the revenue base is already massive, representing 7% of retail sales in the U.S. So it is downright tough to find revenue. It also does not help that about 55% of U.S. revenues for WMT comes from the groceries. The business has suffered from deflationary pressures as well as tough competitive forces — with fierce rivals like Kroger Co (NYSE:KR) — as the industry has consolidated.

(Joe Burbank/Orlando Sentinel via AP) ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — Orlando's law enforcement community is mourning the fatal shooting of an Orlando Police Department sergeant who was killed as she approached a fugitive outside a Wal-Mart store and an Orange County Sheriff's Office deputy who died in a traffic accident more than two hours later while responding to a manhunt for the suspect in the officer's slaying. Master Sgt. Debra Clayton, 42, was killed outside a Wal-Mart store in northwest Orlando early Monday, and Orange County Sheriff's Office Deputy First Class Norman Lewis was killed in a crash while responding to a manhunt for 41-year-old Markeith Loyd. Another Orlando police officer was involved in a crash while responding to the shooting but had only minor injuries. Authorities said Loyd previously was a suspect in the killing of his pregnant ex-girlfriend in December. A massive manhunt involving hundreds of officers was conducted all day Monday as they searched for Loyd in dozens of homes, displacing some residents of a northwest Orlando apartment complex and tying up traffic. "He should be considered armed and dangerous," Police Chief John Mina said. Later in the day, the chief said, "It doesn't matter where he is. We will track him down to the ends of the Earth." Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said deputies had been searching unsuccessfully for Loyd for several weeks since the fatal shooting of his ex-girlfriend and believe he was receiving help from someone. Mina lauded Clayton, a 17-year veteran of the force as a committed officer and a hero who gave her life to the community she loves. The Orlando Police Department said in a tweet that Clayton always had a smile and a high five for every child she came across. Clayton had grown up in the Orlando area and was active in programs that mentored young people. "She was always the first to step up and help kids," Mina said. Clayton was a supervisor for a patrol division in the neighborhood where she was shot, and she previously had worked in investigations and as a school resource officer, Deputy Chief Orlando Rolon said. "She made a point, even outside her working hours, to do things for youth and do things for the community," Rolon said. She was married and had a college-aged son. Police released a video of Clayton's body being taken out of the hospital to a waiting van in a flag-covered stretcher. A line of officers saluted as the stretcher was wheeled out. The apartment complex that was the focus of the manhunt and shooting in northwest Orlando was nowhere near Orlando's tourism corridor in the southern part of the metro area. Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer declared a day of mourning in the city. While at the Wal-Mart on Monday morning, Clayton was tipped off by someone that Loyd was in the area. When she approached him, he fired multiple shots at Clayton, who was wearing body armor, Mina said. Clayton returned fire but didn't hit him, he said. Sheriff's officials said a deputy spotted Loyd fleeing in a vehicle. The suspect pulled into a nearby apartment complex and then fired at a deputy, striking the deputy's SUV twice. The deputy wasn't harmed, the sheriff's office said. Loyd then carjacked another vehicle, drove away and then abandoned the vehicle not far away, according to the sheriff's office. The Orange County Sheriff's Office deputy was killed more than two hours after the shooting when a van collided with his motorcycle as he responded to the manhunt. Demings described the 35-year-old Lewis as "a gentle giant," and the sheriff's office said he had played football for the University of Central Florida before joining the agency 11 years ago.

Authorities advised that arrest warrants were being prepared for people who may have helped 41-year-old Markeith Loyd evade deputies in the past month as they searched for him for questioning in the slaying of his pregnant ex-girlfriend in December. Master Sgt. Debra Clayton was fatally shot Monday morning after she approached Loyd in the parking lot of a Wal-Mart store in northwest Orlando. Many of her colleagues immediately joined the pursuit; among them was a sheriff's deputy who died when he was thrown from his motorcycle in an accident. More than 300 tips from the public have been made, said Barb Bergin, executive director of Crimeline, the tip-line service which is offering the reward, originally set for $60,000. "We have never burned or harmed a tipster. They are kept anonymous," Bergin said in a plea for more tips. "We will not identify you. We just need to know where he is so no one else is hurt." Orange County Sheriff's Office deputies in metro Orlando had been looking for Loyd since his ex-girlfriend was killed. "Certainly it's upsetting he was out and about and killed Debra Clayton, our first homicide in the city of Orlando this year, one of the officers protecting our community," said Mina. Orlando Police confirmed that Clayton was one of the officers who responded to the shooting at Pulse nightclub in which 49 patrons were killed. Last June's massacre in Orlando was the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Clayton, who was married and has a college-aged son, also was known for her mentoring of young people and her involvement in the community in which she had grown up. In the Wal-Mart parking lot Tuesday morning, shoppers laid more than two dozen bouquets of flowers, teddy bears and candles in a makeshift memorial. Some shoppers, like Hal Shore, stopped to say a prayer or take a photo. "It's important that the country is aware that there is a war against police officers," said Shore, a cabinet maker. An apartment complex that was the focus of the manhunt Monday afternoon didn't appear to have any police searches going on Tuesday morning. Some front doors were boarded up from being kicked in Monday because residents weren't home when authorities came knocking. "I'm confident he is gone," said Ida Seck, a resident who had worked with Clayton in her job as a security officer at Universal Orlando Resort. "For things like this to happen, yeah I'm scared for safety and my son's safety but really there is nothing you can do." Court documents show Loyd's criminal record goes back two decades. He was arrested in 1996 on a murder charge that was later dropped. Loyd was arrested for battery on an officer in 1998 and sentenced to more than four years in prison. While behind bars, he pleaded guilty to cocaine possession from a prior case and was transferred to federal prison before being released in July 2014, according to federal records. More recently, his wife whom he is in the process of divorcing, had filed a request for a temporary injunction against him in 2015, and he followed with a similar request against her three days later. Both requests were eventually dismissed in court. He also had paternity suits from three different women filed against him. His Facebook profile had videos of him working out at a gym and hanging out at a nightclub. He said in a November post, "Goals!!!! To be on Americas (sic) most wanted," followed by a series of laughing-with-tears emojis. An Orange County Sheriff's Office deputy was killed more than two hours after Monday's shooting when a van collided with his motorcycle as he responded to the manhunt. Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings described the 35-year-old Norman Lewis as "a gentle giant," and the sheriff's office said he had played football for the University of Central Florida before joining the agency 11 years ago. Funerals were planned for Lewis for Friday and Clayton for Saturday. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Muscly thug Markeith Loyd, 41, has been on the run since December for murdering his pregnant ex-girlfriend. Sergeant Debra Clayton was responding to reports he had been sighted at a branch of the supermarket chain when she was blasted to death on Monday morning. Witnesses said Officer Clayton yelled at Loyd to "stop" but he opened fire and then fled before backup arrived. In a tragic twist of fate, a second police officer died after his motorbike crashed during the manhunt for Loyd. Deputy Norman Lewis, 35, was hit by a van while assisting with the search. Police say the driver, 78, could also face charges. In an emotional outburst at a press conference, Orlando Police Chief John Mina promised: "We are bringing this dirt bag to justice." Shooting suspect Markeith Loyd (Photo: AFP) Loyd 's chilling Facebook post before he allegedly killed his pregnant ex-girlfriend (Photo: Twitter) Meanwhile, Loyd continues to evade capture despite a dramatic shootout with cops near to the Walmart. A cop spotted him a short time after the killing of Officer Clayton, but after an exchange of gunfire, Loyd managed to carjack another vehicle and escape once again. The fugitive gave a chilling warning of his rampage in a Facebook post last year, when he bragged: "Goals!!!! To be on Americas most wanted." In December, police say he murdered his pregnant 24-year-old ex-girlfriend, Sade Dixon, on and wounded her brother. Sergeant Debra Clayton (Photo: AFP) Markeith Loyd wanted poster (Photo: Splash News) The FBI has now also joined the search for Loyd who has been branded "armed and extremely dangerous". He has a long criminal history including convictions for dealing cocaine, battering a prison worker and domestic violence.

AP Two law enforcement officers have been killed during a massive manhunt for a murder suspect in Orlando, Fla. Master Sgt. Debra Clayton radioed from a Wal-Mart shortly after 7 a.m. Monday, saying she was "attempting to contact a murder suspect," according to a statement from the City of Orlando. Other officers radioed two minutes later, reporting that an officer had been shot. The 17-year veteran of the department died after she was transported to a hospital. Police are seeking Markeith Loyd in the murder of a pregnant woman named Sade Dixon last month. Loyd fled from the Wal-Mart and pulled into a nearby apartment building, where police say he fired shots at a sheriff's deputy but did not harm him. Loyd then allegedly stole a car and escaped. This put a manhunt into motion for the suspect, described as "armed and extremely dangerous." During the search, authorities say, a sheriff's deputy riding a motorcycle was hit by a car and later died. The deputy has been identified as Deputy First Class Norman Lewis, an 11-year-veteran of the force.

There is a reward of up to $60,000 for information about the 41-year-old Loyd. The Orlando Police Department says Clayton was married with a son. "She was extremely committed to our youth and really, the community," Orlando Police Chief John Mina told reporters. "And she did so many different projects in the community. She organized several marches against violence by herself — that's how committed she is." The Orange County Sheriff's Office tweeted that Lewis was a "gentle giant" with a "million dollar smile."

Debra Clayton's death marks the first gun-related police fatality of 2017 in the United States (CNN)Hundreds of law enforcement officers were scouring Orlando early Tuesday for a man suspected of fatally shooting a police officer outside a Walmart. The suspect fled, triggering an intense manhunt that included door-to-door searches in apartment complexes and the placing of a dozen schools on lockdown. Another officer died while taking part in the search for the gunman. The Orange County sheriff's deputy died when his motorcycle collided with another vehicle. Orlando tragedy: Two officers remembered After the deaths of two law enforcement officers in one day, Orlando Police Chief John Mina vowed to find the suspect -- who has been identified as Markeith Loyd. "I'm confident we will find him," Mina said. "It doesn't matter where he is. We will track him down to the ends of the Earth to find him." Read More "To lose two law enforcement officers on this Law Enforcement Officer Appreciation Day is indeed a tragedy," Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said. Loyd also is wanted in the killing of a pregnant woman in December, Mina said. A reward of up to $60,000 is offered for information leading to Loyd's arrest. The officer he is suspected of shooting was identified as Orlando police Master Sgt. Debra Clayton, 42. The second officer who died in the accident was identified as Deputy First Class Norman Lewis. "To lose two law enforcement officers on this Law Enforcement Officer Appreciation Day is indeed a tragedy," Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said. 'He shot her down' On Monday morning, someone at a Walmart had contacted Clayton and told her Loyd was in the area, Mina said. It appears Clayton briefly chased the suspect on foot. "As soon as she said stop, he basically opened fire on her," the chief said. One witness told CNN affiliate WFTV he had been outside the Walmart when the shooting happened. "I was walking down the sidewalk, right past the officer, and I heard her tell him to stop, or whatever, and he shot her. He shot her down," said James Herman. Herman said the man continued shooting behind him as he was running from the scene. He also said the man wore a security shirt, but Mina said the suspect was not a security guard. "That's not uncommon," he said. "We run into people in nightclubs that wear T-shirts that say FBI, police." Clayton returned fire but investigators don't think she struck the gunman, Mina said. If you know the location of Markeith Loyd reward is up to $60,000. Please call @CrimelineFL pic.twitter.com/hHrf8bMDWt— Orlando Police (@OrlandoPolice) January 9, 2017 Two minutes after Clayton's last radio contact, police received a call of an officer shot. Officers performed CPR but could not revive Clayton. The pursuit Suspect Markeith Loyd After the shooting, Loyd fled in a vehicle and fired shots at another officer, police said. Hundreds of law enforcement officers descended on the area. The suspect abandoned the vehicle and carjacked a different one, police said. He ditched that second vehicle shortly after and ran into an apartment complex, Mina said. Residents were urged to stay inside and several schools were put on lockdown. By 3 p.m. ET, the lockdowns had been lifted at all the schools, the school system said on Twitter. Mina said officers searched "dozens of apartments and residences" and won't slow down because of darkness. "I believe there have been people out there helping him all along," Mina said. "If we find out about those people we will criminally charge them." He said Loyd would be charged with first-degree murder of a law enforcement officer and attempted murder of the officer he fired at.

Lewis had worked 11 years with the sheriff's department. It is with heavy hearts we announce the death of beloved Deputy First Class Norman Lewis.

The captain was not seriously injured, but authorities are pursuing an attempted murder charge against the suspect. Suspect had been wanted in girlfriend's death CNN affiliate WFTV reported that Loyd was wanted in the December 13 fatal shooting of Sade Dixon, 24, his pregnant girlfriend, outside her home in the Pine Hills neighborhood.

Debra Clayton by jon lockett 9th January 2017, 9:06 pm Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Comments A SWAT team have surrounded an apartment block after a hero cop was gunned down tackling a suspected killer near an Orlando supermarket. Master Sgt. Debra Clayton approached murder suspect Markeith Loyd at 7am today after being tipped off he was inside the Walmart store. AP:Associated Press 10 Armed cops have surrounded the block where Loyd is believed to be holed up Getty Images 10 Master Sgt. Debra Clayton was shot at a Walmart store in Orlando Splash News 10 Markeith Loyd was already wanted over the murder of his pregnant girlfriend AP:Associated Press 10 Law enforcement officers conduct a door-to-door search at an apartment complex in Orlando But she was shot ‘multiple times’ and died soon after. Sgt. Clayton – who was wearing body armour – returned fire but didn’t hit him. Now armed cops and a SWAT unit have surrounded a housing block off Cinderlene Parkway where the suspect is believed to be holed up. Police have called on Loyd to give himself up before any more blood is spilled. Police Chief John Mina said : “If we have to go in after him, then that jeopardises and puts at risk the safety of law enforcement officers … and we cannot control what happens in that situation.” Desperate Loyd – wanted over the murder of his pregnant girlfriend Sade Dixon – fled the scene of the earlier shooting, hijacking a car, and firing at least two shots at a pursuing police vehicle. He then abandoned the first car and stole another, according to police. Authorities are now offering a $60,000 reward for help in his capture. “We’re going to bring this dirtbag to justice and he’s going to jail,” added Chief  Mina.

He shot her down. He took off running. It’s unreal.” Herman said the man continued to shoot behind him as he was running from the scene. “As he was running, he was shooting back, he was shooting backwards,” Herman said. “I hit the ground on the side over here because I wasn’t sure where the shooting was coming from at first.” Police hunting gunman who shot hero female cop at Orlando supermarket AP:Associated Press 10 Officers comfort each other after news of the cop shooting broke Splash News 10 The long-serving officer was well known in her local community A massive manhunt has been launched after a female police officer was shot near an Orlando Walmart https://t.co/ObKxyaeaGq pic.twitter.com/aYdy7qWXia — CBS News (@CBSNews) January 9, 2017 Sgt. Clayton had been shopping and was putting bags into the trunk of her vehicle when she was approached by another shopper, Herman said. "The customer walked up to her and said that someone they were looking for, wanted, was in the store in the line to check out," he said. "She went in there, I guess, to confront him. As she was going back to Walmart, he was coming out, and he shot her." During the manhunt, an Orange County Sheriff’s deputy was also tragically killed in a motorcycle accident. The Florida Highway Patrol confirmed the deputy, named as Norman Lewis, was involved in the hunt at the time of the crash. Clermont, Florida resident Billie Jarrard allegedly “turned into the direct path” of the officer. The Florida Highway Patrol said in a statement that charges are pending against Jarrard. Another police officer also was involved in a crash while responding to the shooting but only had minor injuries. AP:Associated Press 10 Patrol Troopers secure the scene after cop Norman Lewis was struck and killed AP:Associated Press 10 An armoured vehicle is currently at the site of the 'siege' AP:Associated Press 10 Officers salute the body of Master Sgt. Debra Clayton Splash News 10 Loyd previously spent four years in prison for battery of a law enforcement officer Chief Mina said during a Monday morning press conference that Clayton, a 17-year veteran, was well-known on the force. “She organised several marches against violence by herself. That’s how dedicated she was,” Mina said. Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said police had circulated Loyd’s image in the community because of the previous murder case, and officers had been on the lookout for him. “That indicates to me he is receiving help,” Demings said. Loyd previously spent four years in prison for battery of a law enforcement officer and resisting arrest with violence. He was sentenced to 27 months in prison in 2011 for possessing homemade weapons while in federal custody. He was also charged in a 1995 murder case, but those charges were dropped. As hundreds of officers from multiple departments continue the manhunt, more than a dozen local schools were placed on lockdown.

(AP) — The Latest on the shooting of a police officer in Orlando, Florida (all times local): 5:15 p.m. Authorities have identified the Orange County Sheriff's Office deputy who was killed in a motorcycle crash when responding to a massive manhunt for a suspect in the fatal shooting of an Orlando police sergeant. The sheriff's office said Monday that he is 35-year-old Deputy First Class Norman Lewis. Lewis was killed when his motorcycle collided with a van as he was responding to a manhunt for 41-year-old Markeith Loyd. Loyd is a suspect in the fatal shooting of Master Sgt. Debra Clayton of the Orlando Police Department. Lewis had been with the sheriff's office for 11 years and Sheriff Jerry Demings described him as "a gentle giant." The sheriff's office says he had played football for the University of Central Florida. ___ 4:05 p.m. Authorities say they've searched dozens of apartments and residences as part of a massive manhunt for a suspect in the fatal shooting of an Orlando police sergeant. Orlando Police Chief John Mina said at a news conference Monday afternoon that the focus of the manhunt was on an apartment complex in the northwest part of the metro area. Mina says authorities have probable cause to arrest 41-year-old Markeith Loyd for first-degree murder in the death of Master Sgt. Debra Clayton. Authorities say Clayton was fatally shot after she approached Loyd outside a Wal-Mart store Monday morning. He was wanted for questioning in the shooting death of his pregnant ex-girlfriend last month. Mina says Clayton returned fire but Loyd wasn't hit. The chief also says Clayton was wearing body armor. ___ 2:40 p.m. Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings is urging a suspect wanted for the murder of an Orlando police officer to turn himself in to authorities. Demings spoke Monday at a news conference held near the area in northwest metro Orlando where hundreds of officers from multiple police agencies were searching for 41-year-old Markeith Loyd. Demings says the best thing he could tell the suspect is to surrender so the situation can be resolved peacefully. Loyd is suspected in the shooting death of Master Sgt. Debra Clayton. Authorities say Clayton was shot after she approached Loyd outside a Wal-Mart store Monday morning. He was wanted for questioning in the shooting death of his pregnant ex-girlfriend last month. 11:15 a.m. Authorities say a deputy has been killed in a motorcycle crash while searching for a suspect in the shooting death of an Orlando police officer. Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings told a press conference Monday that another vehicle turned in front of the deputy, who was riding a motorcycle in pursuit of 41-year-old Markeith Loyd. Loyd is suspected in the shooting death of Master Sgt. Debra Clayton. A massive manhunt was underway for him. Clayton was shot and killed in the line of duty near a Wal-Mart in Orlando. Police Chief John Mina says Loyd also is wanted in the slaying of a pregnant woman. ___ 10:25 a.m. An Orlando police officer who was gunned down while on duty has died. Orlando police announced the officer's death on its official Twitter account Monday morning. The shooting happened near a Walmart store in Orlando earlier Monday morning. The tweet said, "One of our own was taken in the line of duty. There are no words." With the Twitter post was a video of the officer's body being taken out of the hospital to a waiting van in a flag-covered stretcher. Police tell news outlets that suspect Markeith Loyd is still on the run. A massive manhunt is underway and several schools are in lockdown mode. Police have asked anyone with information to contact authorities. A news conference is scheduled for 10:45 a.m. at Orlando Regional Medical Center. ___ An Orlando, Florida, police officer has been taken to the hospital following a shooting as authorities searched for a suspect. According to the police department's official Twitter page, the shooting happened just after 7:15 a.m. Monday not far from a Walmart. A massive manhunt for the suspect is underway. No additional details were provided about the shooting. The Orlando Sentinel (http://bit.ly/2i8wHZ6 ) reports at least seven Orlando police officers and Orange County Sheriff's deputies were seen escorting an ambulance carrying the officer to the hospital shortly after the shooting. Traffic has been detoured around the area.

Sports How One Skater Racked Up Thousands Of Miles On Four Wheels, Two Crutches, And One Leg Nailing “Pop Shove-Its” is just Conner Millan’s latest trick by Jana K. Hoffman Share January 9, 2017 Share on Facebook Click me! Share on Twitter Click me! Copy Link For most skateboarders, that first board is unforgettable. For 23-year-old Conner Millan, it has helped shape his entire life. Millan received his—a Walmart Spiderman board—as a gift from his mother when he was 8 years old. He remembers sitting on it and riding around when another boy his age pushed his way past. “He asked me why I wasn’t standing on it, and from that day on I was determined to learn how to skate standing up,” Millan tells GOOD. Millan was born with spina bifida, a rare birth defect in which an infant’s spine fails to develop properly in the womb. According to Mayo Clinic, there are fewer than 200,000 U.S. cases of spina bifida yearly. This chronic developmental disability can’t be cured and requires an immediate medical diagnosis. Some cases may require surgery and others require treatment to help with management over time. Despite his condition, it didn’t take Millan long to skate standing up. And that was just the beginning of Millan’s unlikely journey, defying everyone’s expectations and racking up hundreds of thousands of miles on four wheels, two crutches, and, eventually, one leg. People often make assumptions about Millan’s condition and ability to perform common functions and partake in physical activities. “(They) think that I’m not in a position to stand up for myself,” he says. Then he laughs while saying he’s no different than anyone else thanks, in part, to his skateboard.   “I want to be able to spread more awareness about spina bifida,” Millan says. “Not all forms can be visually identified or seen from an outward perspective.” Much like other disabilities and the lack of knowledge surrounding them, there are many misconceptions. Millan doesn’t experience any pain or soreness unless he spends the day skating, and his case could be very different from other spina bifida cases. People assume Millan can’t drive (he can). When he’s in the wheelchair, they think he’s stuck in it, that he’s unable to walk or function. And obviously, they’re surprised to find out that Millan can skateboard. “There isn’t a lot of accessible information, and I’d like to be able to change that.” At the time of this writing, Millan was in Venice, CA, skating his way through Los Angeles. This isn’t the first time he has done that. During his first visit two years ago, he was skating in the Life Rolls On competition and took a bad fall that opened up a callous on his foot. From spina bifida, both of Millan’s feet turn to the right, and his left foot developed a callous where all the weight was centered. “They gave me a pill antibiotic,” Millan says about his Los Angeles hospital visit following the accident. “I skated out of the hospital with a hole in my foot.”   He returned to his native Florida for further medical attention and intensive recovery. “The torn callous became infected, and my leg needed to be amputated,” he says. Millan spent two months in the hospital. He didn’t know if he would ever skate again. Then local non-profit Friends of Fernandina Skate Park launched a GoFundMe campaign. Between insurance and generous donations from across the nation, Millan was able to pay for a prosthetic leg, one for which he anxiously waited seven months to receive.   It didn’t take long for Millan to learn how to skate with a prosthetic either. “Because of spina bifida, I couldn’t move my ankles or toes anyway so learning how to skate with a prosthetic wasn’t too big of a change.” He says he had to get used to the weight of the prosthetic and the stiffness of the ankle piece. “Nothing that took longer than a day or two to get used to,” he adds. I skated out of the hospital with a hole in my foot. The only remaining issue for Millan is the sweat factor. He says the rubber cup that holds the prosthetic on isn’t very breathable and if he sweats, it slides down. “I’ve talked to my friend’s buddy who’s also an amputee that skateboards,” Millan says. “He told me try deodorant or baby powder.” Millan’s GoFundMe page is still active. He is trying to raise enough funds to replace his crutches with SideStix, which are devices developed especially for performance and those who seek comfortable, limitless mobility. “They’re stronger, have suspension in them, and are a pretty big upgrade from the ones I’m using now,” he says.  Millan approaches VENICE skate park with confidence—and some caution. He prefers street skating than skate parks, and is still learning how to skate bowls. Nevertheless, he greets his friends (which he makes wherever he goes) and pops out of his wheelchair with ease, utilizing his great upper body strength borne of daily crutch use. To affix his prosthetic, he rolls a rubber sleeve on to his leg and snaps the metal rod in place. He needs to remove the prosthetic for short periods of time to allow the sweat to dry up. The socks that come with the prosthetic for fitting purposes also need to be cleaned. Unlike other skateboarders who use their feet to push, Millan uses his crutches. The maneuver may seem challenging, but for Millan, who skates regular-footed, it’s clockwork. He still needs to lean into turns, but utilizes a crutch to brake. Tricks are a bit more limiting, but Millan has the “Pop Shove It” dialed in. To start the trick out, he places his crutches down on opposite sides of the board. Next, he kicks the tail of the board downward at an angle. Using his arms and the crutches that are still placed on the ground, he pushes himself up for the jumping motion while popping the board with his feet. “I don’t have enough muscle in my legs to land on my feet alone,” Millan says. “When I land, I usually place one crutch down to catch myself.” When all is said and done, he rolls on and to the next trick. No big deal. Millan has caught the wanderlust bug like many of today’s twentysomethings. Latching on to what became one of 2016’s most-talked about alternative living styles, he plans to drive a van and skate across the country in this new year, opting to forgo modern amenities and comfort for life on the road and lasting memories. (Millan generally uses hand controls to drive but can also use his foot.) He’s already nailed the hipster vagabond look without even trying. But on this day, it’s unusually empty at the Venice park as the sun begins to dip beyond the Pacific horizon. Millan gets ready to drop in as passersby gather around to watch. A curious little boy runs up to Millan, pointing toward his leg and asking, “What happened? What happened?” Millan stops to explain, in the simplest way possible, that he had an accident. The father, clearly embarrassed, apologizes profusely, but Millan shakes it off like it’s no big deal. He always shakes it off, because to Millan, it’s never been a big deal.

The Orlando Police Department announced the death of Master Sgt. Debra Clayton on its official Twitter account Monday morning. A short time later, authorities said at a press conference that a second law enforcement officer was killed in a vehicle accident while searching for the suspect in Clayton's killing. The shooting occurred near a Walmart store in northwest Orlando earlier Monday. The suspect has been identified as Markeith Loyd, 41. Authorities said Loyd previously was a suspect in the murder of his pregnant ex-girlfriend last December. Authorities were offering a $60,000 reward for any information leading to Loyd's arrest. Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said deputies had been searching unsuccessfully for Loyd for several weeks and believe he was receiving help from someone. "He should be considered armed and dangerous," said Police Chief John Mina said at a press conference. "He will be brought to justice." Mina lauded Clayton, a 17-year veteran of the force as a "committed" officer and "a hero" who gave her life to the community she loves. The tweet said Clayton always had a smile and a high five for every child she came across. "She made a point, even outside her working hours, do to things for youth and do things for the community," said Deputy Chief Orlando Rolon, who added he assumed she was wearing a bulletproof vest since that is agency policy. She was married and had two children. She died Monday at 7:40 a.m., less than an hour after she was shot while on duty. Police released a video of Clayton's body being taken out of the hospital to a waiting van in a flag-covered stretcher. A line of officers saluted as the stretcher was wheeled out. Authorities said 17 area schools were placed in lockdown following the shooting. Mina said officers believed they knew where Loyd was. Officers were deployed to an apartment complex in northwest Orlando. The apartment complex and shooting in northwest Orlando was nowhere near Orlando's tourism corridor in the southern part of the metro area. "There will be a large law enforcement presence in that area until we can determine he is not there," Mina said. Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer declared a day of mourning in the city. Clayton either recognized Loyd or had been tipped off to his whereabouts when she approached him Monday morning, Mina said. Loyd then fired multiple shots at Clayton, according to the police. Sheriff's officials said Loyd was spotted by a deputy fleeing in the Orlando police officer's vehicle. The suspect pulled into a nearby apartment complex and then fired at a deputy, striking the deputy's SUV twice. The deputy wasn't harmed, the sheriff's office said. Loyd then carjacked another vehicle, drove away and then abandoned the vehicle not far away, according to the sheriff's office. The manhunt was being conducted where he abandoned the vehicle. Gov. Rick Scott cancelled an appearance in Orlando because of the shooting but appeared with Orlando officials at the news conference. "I'm heartbroken and angry," Scott said.

Photo: Allison Jarrell By Allison Jarrell Spoolies 844.776.6543 www.spoolies.com You could say Jeanne James is a risk taker. James, who currently resides in Dana Point, lived with her family for a year in Kenya doing missionary work and running a guest house there. She’s sailed across the Atlantic with her husband and two sons. And she quit her full-time job to dedicate all of her resources and energy on reviving a quirky 1960s hair product—Spoolies. Not only have James and her husband, Tim, succeeded in bringing Spoolies back, but they’ve won two awards for the trendsetting silicone hair curlers and are now selling the American-made styling tools at 400 Wal-Mart stores across the nation. The recent partnership with Wal-Mart is part of the retailer’s 2013 commitment to buy an additional $250 billion in U.S. products by 2023. James is completely self-taught when it comes to all things manufacturing—she attended trade shows, made endless phone calls, researched online and picked up on industry nuances. “You have to be tenacious,” James said of being an entrepreneur. “I think a lot of running a business is not giving up. You have to fight for what you want.” James initially got the idea to revamp the retro rubber curlers in 2003. After working for a year in Kenya, James was inspired to raise money to help send some of the young girls there to school, but she didn’t want to just ask for donations. James wanted a sustainable model—a business opportunity that could continuously raise funds. James eventually remembered Spoolies—the curlers she wore as a kid that allowed her to avoid the dreaded frizzy perm. She wondered whether they were still in production. After a bit of research, James discovered that Conair had pulled the Spoolies trademark in the ’90s and had since released it, giving her the opportunity to revive the product. James obtained a patent, set out to find a U.S. manufacturer and updated the design and materials—trading latex rubber for 100 percent hypoallergenic silicone. Manufacturing the curlers would have been much cheaper in China, but James said it was imperative to keep production in the U.S. so that she could truly “trust the product and the quality behind it.” Not only did she end up keeping production in the States, but she found a factory in San Clemente, just 10 minutes from her home. The new and improved Spoolies debuted in December 2014. Since then, they’ve popped up on the shelves of Wal-Mart stores, and James said they’ll be an “impulse buy” in 350 stores next year, which means the curlers will be on display throughout the store—not just in the beauty aisle. Beginning in February, stores will carry nine-packs of James’ new jumbo curlers, as well as the regular size. The retro curlers have also been getting attention online from a younger generation of beauty bloggers—recent video reviews on Instagram have reached thousands of viewers. But most importantly to James, proceeds from Spoolies’ sales have been donated to Sister Freda’s Foundation in Kenya, which operates a hospital and clinic, a girls’ high school and a college for nursing, among other programs. To date, Spoolies has funded 30 beds at the school, which will sleep 60 girls. In addition to select Wal-Mart stores, Spoolies can be found online in 12- or 24-packs.

The fallen officer, Sgt. Debra Clayton, was shot multiple times outside a Walmart near the Pine Hills area this morning, police said. The suspected shooter is on the loose. (Twitter/Orlando Police) Schools were locked down, roads closed and two law enforcement officers died near Orlando on Monday, as a month-long hunt closed in on a murder suspect and turned violent. Accused of killing his pregnant ex-girlfriend last month, Markeith D. Loyd shot Sgt. Debra Clayton multiple times when she confronted him outside a Walmart near the Pine Hills area west of Orlando, police said. Loyd then fled the scene and remains at large. That wasn’t the end of the violence: A sheriff’s deputy was struck and killed by a sport-utility vehicle while responding to the shooting, and another deputy took fire while trying to stop Loyd’s presumed getaway vehicle. Hours later — as hundreds of local, state and federal officers scoured streets and apartment blocks — Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings looked into a bank of TV cameras and urged Loyd to turn himself in. “Otherwise this is going to be a very, very risky operation for all of us,” he said. The mayhem began early in the morning — apparently when a 17-year police veteran went shopping at a Walmart in the Pine Hills area. A witness told ABC affiliate WFTV that Clayton, a married mother of two, was putting her bags in her trunk when a customer walked up and told her a wanted man was inside the store. Police had been looking for Loyd since Dec. 13, the day he allegedly shot and killed his pregnant ex-girlfriend and wounded her brother, according to the Orlando Sentinel. He was considered armed and dangerous. Clayton turned back toward the Walmart just as the suspect walked out, James Herman told WFTV. “I heard her tell him: Stop,” Herman said.  “He shot her down and he took off running.” The suspect fired backward as he ran, the witness said. OPD @ChiefJohnMina It is with such a heavy heart that I have to tell you Master Sgt Debra Clayton a 17-year veteran of OPD, died at 7:40 am pic.twitter.com/owWHyuaOtj — Orlando Police (@OrlandoPolice) January 9, 2017 Clayton was shot twice in the chest and once in the abdomen, WFTV reported. Her heart stopped in the ambulance on the way to the hospital. Paramedics briefly revived her, but a flag-covered gurney was later wheeled out of the hospital as police officers lined up to salute it. [Fort Lauderdale shooting suspect to make first court appearance on federal charges] “Oh God!!!” Orlando commissioner Regina Hill wrote on Facebook. “Please pray for my OPD Liaison. She’s been shot down in Pinehills.” A massive manhunt was underway for the man who police say shot and killed an Orlando police officer. A sheriff's deputy was struck and killed while responding to the shooting on Jan. 9. (Reuters) In the early scramble for the suspect, an Orange County sheriff’s deputy on a motorcycle was struck by a vehicle. “He squeezed my hand. His arm was going cold,” a witness who tried to save the deputy told WFTV. “I thought he was going to make it.” The deputy died of his injuries. His name was being withheld until his family is notified. Another deputy spotted a speeding vehicle that matched the description of Loyd’s, and made a U-turn to pursue it, Sheriff Demings said at a news conference. The driver opened fire, the sheriff said, hitting the deputy’s vehicle but not harming him. According to WFTV, Loyd allegedly carjacked a vehicle and escaped again. Large swaths of the Pine Hills area were cordoned off as officers hunted for Loyd. After several hours, the Orlando Sentinel reported that SWAT police had surrounded an apartment and were calling Loyd out — rifles ready and helicopters circling. “He will be brought to justice,” Orlando Police Chief John Mina told reporters at the news conference. “I can assure the community of that.” But more hours passed with no sign of Loyd, as the searchers roved across the city. A reward for his capture was increased to $60,000, and authorities warned that anyone helping him hide would be prosecuted. Markeith Loyd is the suspect who shot OPD officer this morning.

Florida Gov. Rick Scott prayed. City officials and law enforcement officers wept openly in front of TV cameras. Just spoke to @ChiefJohnMina and am praying for @OrlandoPolice. I let him know the State stands ready to help in any way. — Rick Scott (@FLGovScott) January 9, 2017 Clayton was one of the first officers who responded to the Pulse nightclub shooting in June, arriving minutes after 911 calls came in about shots fired, according to police records. The Orlando officer appears to be the first law enforcement official fatally shot this year. Her death comes after a surge last year in the number of law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty, a toll pushed upward by an increase in deadly shootings and ambush attacks. These shootings included high-profile attacks in Dallas and Baton Rouge that left a combined eight officers dead, ambushes that rattled law enforcement officers nationwide at a time of tension between police and the communities they serve. [Ambushes and fatal shootings fuel increase in police death toll this year] Although statistics show a steep drop in the number of line-of-duty deaths since the 1970s, officers and others in law enforcement have said in recent years that they are increasingly on edge amid protests against how police use deadly force and concerned about the public perception of police. Others have expressed concern about anti-government attackers targeting law enforcement officers and the number of guns available on the streets. Last year, 65 police officers were killed in shootings, up from 41 the year before, according to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, a nonprofit group that monitors line-of-duty deaths. THIS is how we know and remember Sergeant Debra Clayton. She always had a smile for kids and always took a moment to interact w/community. pic.twitter.com/8zL46iyUe6 — Orlando Police (@OrlandoPolice) January 9, 2017 Gunfire was the common factor in nearly half of the 136 law enforcement deaths in 2016, according to the group, the highest percentage in more than two decades. Before 2016, it was more common in recent years for officers to die in traffic accidents than shootings. Ambushes were behind an unusually high share of these deaths, with nearly 1 in 3 officers fatally shot in such an attack. The surge in officers killed by gunfire last year was the largest on record, up 56 percent over the previous year, according to data from the memorial fund. This post has been updated.

RESTAURANT REVIEW: LITTLE LAMB GASTROPUB IN CLEARWATER IMPRESSES WITH BOLD FLAVORS, EDGY ATMOSPHERE AND AMBITIOUS DESSERTS [DOUGLAS R. CLIFFORD | Times] Among the fare at the Little Lamb Gastropub in Clearwater is Char Siu Pork Ribs. The meat is fall-off-the-bone tender and topped with pickled onion, mint, peanuts and a kicky lime vinaigrette. Gastropub is one of those words we're still a little iffy on. Does it mean fancy food in an easygoing setting, and with a whole lot of craft beer? Or does it somehow signal a drinking joint with suspiciously delicious meats? James Renew isn't too hung up on a narrow definition: "It means elevated food served in a casual, public house-type atmosphere." Check out Laura Reiley's review of Little Lamb Gastropub, tucked in an unlikely strip mall spot for an edgy, ambitious restaurant with a spare, big-city aesthetic.

The sheriff's office said Monday that he is 35-year-old Deputy First Class Norman Lewis. Lewis was killed when his motorcycle collided with a van as he was responding to a manhunt for 41-year-old Markeith Loyd. Loyd is a suspect in the fatal shooting of Master Sgt. Debra Clayton of the Orlando Police Department. Lewis had been with the sheriff's office for 11 years and Sheriff Jerry Demings described him as "a gentle giant."

Mina says authorities have probable cause to arrest 41-year-old Markeith Loyd for first-degree murder in the death of Master Sgt. Debra Clayton. Authorities say Clayton was fatally shot after she approached Loyd outside a Wal-Mart store Monday morning. He was wanted for questioning in the shooting death of his pregnant ex-girlfriend last month. Mina says Clayton returned fire but Loyd wasn't hit.

Demings says the best thing he could tell the suspect is to surrender so the situation can be resolved peacefully. Loyd is suspected in the shooting death of Master Sgt. Debra Clayton. Authorities say Clayton was shot after she approached Loyd outside a Wal-Mart store Monday morning. He was wanted for questioning in the shooting death of his pregnant ex-girlfriend last month. 11:15 a.m. Authorities say a deputy has been killed in a motorcycle crash while searching for a suspect in the shooting death of an Orlando police officer. Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings told a press conference Monday that another vehicle turned in front of the deputy, who was riding a motorcycle in pursuit of 41-year-old Markeith Loyd.

Police Chief John Mina says Loyd also is wanted in the slaying of a pregnant woman. ___ 10:25 a.m. An Orlando police officer who was gunned down while on duty has died. Orlando police announced the officer's death on its official Twitter account Monday morning. The shooting happened near a Walmart store in Orlando earlier Monday morning.

AP By MIKE SCHNEIDER Monday, January 09, 2017 05:27PM ORLANDO, FL -- A massive manhunt was underway Monday in central Florida as authorities searched for a man accused of shooting and killing an Orlando police officer. The Orlando Police Department announced the death of Master Sgt. Debra Clayton on its official Twitter account Monday morning. A short time later, authorities said at a press conference that a second law enforcement officer was killed in a vehicle accident while searching for the suspect in Clayton's killing. The shooting occurred near a Walmart store in northwest Orlando earlier Monday. The suspect has been identified as Markeith Loyd, 41. Authorities said Loyd previously was a suspect in the murder of his pregnant ex-girlfriend last December. Authorities were offering a $60,000 reward for any information leading to Loyd's arrest. Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said deputies had been searching unsuccessfully for Loyd for several weeks and believe he was receiving help from someone. "He should be considered armed and dangerous," said Police Chief John Mina said at a press conference. "He will be brought to justice." Mina lauded Clayton, a 17-year veteran of the force as a "committed" officer and "a hero" who gave her life to the community she loves. The tweet said Clayton always had a smile and a high five for every child she came across. "She made a point, even outside her working hours, do to things for youth and do things for the community," said Deputy Chief Orlando Rolon, who added he assumed she was wearing a bulletproof vest since that is agency policy. She was married and had two children. She died Monday at 7:40 a.m., less than an hour after she was shot while on duty. Police released a video of Clayton's body being taken out of the hospital to a waiting van in a flag-covered stretcher. A line of officers saluted as the stretcher was wheeled out. Authorities said 17 area schools were placed in lockdown following the shooting. Mina said officers believed they knew where Loyd was. Officers were deployed to an apartment complex in northwest Orlando. The apartment complex and shooting in northwest Orlando was nowhere near Orlando's tourism corridor in the southern part of the metro area. "There will be a large law enforcement presence in that area until we can determine he is not there," Mina said. Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer declared a day of mourning in the city. Clayton either recognized Loyd or had been tipped off to his whereabouts when she approached him Monday morning, Mina said. Loyd then fired multiple shots at Clayton, according to the police. Sheriff's officials said Loyd was spotted by a deputy fleeing in the Orlando police officer's vehicle. The suspect pulled into a nearby apartment complex and then fired at a deputy, striking the deputy's SUV twice. The deputy wasn't harmed, the sheriff's office said. Loyd then carjacked another vehicle, drove away and then abandoned the vehicle not far away, according to the sheriff's office. The manhunt was being conducted where he abandoned the vehicle. Gov. Rick Scott cancelled an appearance in Orlando because of the shooting but appeared with Orlando officials at the news conference. "I'm heartbroken and angry," Scott said.

just-style home News & insights News Wal-Mart promotes Furner to Sam's Club CEO By Michelle Russell | 9 January 2017 Font size Email Print US retail giant Wal-Mart Stores Inc has promoted John Furner as chief executive of its Sam's Club division following the retirement of Rosalind Brewer. Furner, currently executive vice president and chief merchandising offer for Sam's Club, will take up the role from 1 February. He takes over from Brewer who has served as Sam's Club CEO since February 2012. Fruner has served in a number of roles with the retailer, including senior vice president and chief merchandising officer of Walmart China from January 2013 to October 2015, and senior vice president of home and apparel, and global sourcing, for a year before that. In its last quarter, Walmart posted "solid" results that saw e-commerce growth accelerate, and US operations strengthen. It booked a 2.3% fall in net income to $3.0bn, but revenues on a constant currency basis increased 2.5% to $120.3bn, while US comparable store sales were up 1.2%, marking the ninth straight quarterly gain.

A massive manhunt is underway in Orlando for Markeith Loyd, 41, who was spotted Monday morning fleeing in a vehicle from the Walmart near Princeton Avenue near John Young Parkway, where the Orlando officer was shot, the Orange County Sheriff's Office said.

The deputy was not injured. Loyd then carjacked a vehicle and took off, deputies said. He later abandoned the vehicle near the intersection of Rosemont and Cinderlane Parkway, where a manhunt is underway, officials said. Authorities said Loyd should be considered armed and dangerous. "We are asking the public to assist us with his whereabouts," the Sheriff's Office said. "However, we ask the public not to approach him and call 911 instead." The Orlando officer was taken to a hospital and was later pronounced dead. Officials will hold a news conference at 10:45 a.m. at Orlando Regional Medical Center.

Several law enforcement officers swarmed the area, and Orlando police said motorists should avoid driving to Pine Hills. Numerous officers were spotted carrying assault rifles at several intersections in the area. Fifteen schools in the Pine Hills area are locked down because of the search. The Orlando police officer is the second U.S. officer killed in the line of duty this year, according to the Officer Down Memorial website.

The smiley face first appeared at a store in North Carolina in 1989 and then grew to be the face of the brand. "Whenever you'd walk in the door, the greeter would have a roll of smiley face stickers," said Savannah Lester, who stopped by the exhibit during a family outing. Nearly 30 years ago, Henry Jordan, a store manager in Whiteville, North Carolina, and his wife came up with the smiley face logo hoping to get more kids to come into the store. They printed "Wal-Mart Lil' Shopper" at the bottom of the stickers, and they turned out to be a hit. Walmart Founder Sam Walton wrote a letter to Jordan praising him for his bright idea and the retailer adopted the smiley face in its stores nationwide. The face eventually became the face of the savings customers could get at Walmart. Walmart plans to bring the savings symbol out of retirement this year. The museum exhibit will be on display until Jan. 31.

VIDEO: DRAMATIC FOOTAGE OF INTENSE MIAMI STANDOFF RELEASED BY POLICE The suspect, identified as Markeith Loyd, was accused of murdering his pregnant ex-girlfriend last month, Fox 35 reported, adding that police had never caught him.

An Orlando SWAT team had surrounded an apartment complex a couple miles northwest of the Walmart around noon, demanding Loyd step outside, but eventually left. Earlier in the day, a motorcycle crash killed an Orange County deputy sheriff taking part in the manhunt, the sheriff announced. Florida Blue Alert Additional photos of suspect Markeith Loyd.

He was wearing a T-shirt that read "security" during the shooting, Mina said. Police identified the officer killed as Master Sgt. Debra Clayton, a 17-year veteran of the force and mother of two, married for one year. Officials did not identify the deputy who died. At least 64 officers were killed in gun-related incidents in 2016, a jump of more than 50 percent from the previous year, according to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund. "I was walking down the sidewalk, right past the officer, and I heard her tell him to stop, or whatever, and he shot her. He shot her down," witness James Herman told WFTV. The officer was wearing protective gear and returned fire -- but apparently missed, Mina said.

The shooting unfolded three days after the massacre at the Ft. Lauderdale airport, which left five people dead. Loyd had been on the run since Dec. 13 when police accused him of shooting and killing 24-year-old Sade Dixon, a pregnant mother of two, and critically wounding her brother, Ronald Steward, outside her home. Dixon's surviving relatives told Fox 35 she had just broken up with Loyd. The Orange County Sheriff's Office stated the suspect's age as 41, but the Sentinel reported it as 43. Prosecutors reportedly had dropped drug-dealing charges against him earlier. Herman said a shopper had tipped off the officer -- who was putting bags in the trunk of her vehicle -- that Loyd was in the Walmart waiting to check out. As the officer walked towards the store, the suspect barged out and fired at least 12 shots, according to Herman. Three shots hit the officer, WFTV reported. After deputies launched the manhunt, the suspect pulled into a nearby apartment complex and fired shots, hitting one deputy's unmarked SUV twice before carjacking another vehicle and escaping, Fox 35 added. Nobody was reported hurt at the apartment complex. The search also led police to the Pine Hills area a few miles west of Orlando. City Commissioner Regina Hill identified the officer as her Orlando Police Dept. liaison. The officer's heart briefly stopped while paramedics were racing her to Orlando Regional Medical Center, rescuers said. Officials locked down more than a dozen schools in the area for several hours, and closed the Walmart. Evidence markers were spotted in the store's parking lot. "Any act of violence against our heroes is cowardly and shameful and our state will not stand for it," Gov. Rick Scott responded. Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer declared a day of mourning. Students and staff in the locked-down schools were safe, Fox 35 added. Click for more from Fox 35.

Police said Orlando Master Sgt. Debra Clayton was approached Monday morning at around 7 a.m. by a person who recognized Markeith Loyd, a man suspected of killing his pregnant ex-girlfriend in December. The witness pointed Clayton toward Loyd, and the sergeant called dispatch to announce she was approaching the suspect. Moments later, a man believed to be Loyd shot Clayton multiple times. She died soon after. The Orlando Police Department family is heartbroken today. One of our own was taken in the line of duty. There are no words. pic.twitter.com/M48o1nnr4h— Orlando Police (@OrlandoPolice) January 9, 2017 Loyd fled the scene, hijacking a car, and firing at least two shots at a pursuing police vehicle. He then abandoned the first car he hijacked and stole another, according to police.    During the manhunt, an Orange County Sheriff’s deputy was killed in a motorcycle accident. The Florida Highway Patrol confirmed to CBS News that the deputy, identified as Deputy First Class Norman Lewis, was involved in the manhunt at the time of the crash. Clermont, Florida resident Billie Jarrard allegedly “turned into the direct path” of the deputy, am 11-year veteran. The Florida Highway Patrol said in a statement that charges are pending against Jarrard. That million dollar smile. The consummate professional.

That’s how dedicated she was,” Mina said. Police announced on Monday a reward of up to $60,000 for information leading to Loyd’s arrest. Mina said during a Monday afternoon press conference that if Loyd is arrested, he will be charged with first degree murder of a law enforcement officer and attempted murder of a law enforcment officer. Authorities have so far searched dozens of apartments and houses in their search for Loyd, who police believe has received assistance during his flight.

Loyd previously spent four years in prison for battery of a law enforcement officer and resisting arrest with violence. He was sentenced to 27 months in prison in 2011 for possessing homemade weapons while in federal custody.  He was also charged in a 1995 murder case, but those charges were dropped. © 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

The increase turned out to be economically instrumental, as it fostered greater productivity and improved employee relations among Ford assembly workers. In contemporary times, some businesses have imitated this yet-unusual tactic with hopes for similar economic gains. In 2015, Gravity Payments Inc experimented with a $70,000 minimum annual salary. The decision on the part of CEO Dan Price prompted a loss of clients and some of the company’s top employees, but the company is still afloat and functioning.

(NYSE: JPM) raised their minimum hourly pay — the former by rates between 5 and 15 percent and the latter by increments between $1.85 and $6.35. Between 2015 and 2016, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE: WMT) raised its minimum hourly pay on two separate occasions: once from $8 to $9, and then to its present rate of $10. The company is currently enduring a large-scale battle with employees demanding a $15 minimum. If successful, the “Fight for Fifteen” movement would cost Wal-Mart an estimated $4.95 billion annually according to the UC Berkeley Center for Labor Research. When The Government Intervenes While some corporations institute voluntary wages increases, others effect change more reluctantly and only to comply with federal mandates. After New Zealand enacted the first federally regulated minimum wage law in 1894, the United States was slow to follow suit. Nearly 45 years passed before the United States instituted the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, which established a minimum hourly wage of $0.25. Throughout history, the rate increased just short of 30 times, with the most recent change setting the price at $7.25. According to the Economic Policy Institute, this figure lies about $18 below the average U.S. hourly wage. Most states maintain their own wage laws. As of January 1, 29 states and D.C. enforced minimums above the federal rate and 14 states maintained the same rates as the federal government. Five had no minimum wage law, and two enforced rates lower than the federal minimum; employers in each state are obligated to comply with federal rules. Throughout 2016, 20 states increased or were in the process of increasing their minimum wages, and 12 others currently have plans to effect raises in the coming years.
