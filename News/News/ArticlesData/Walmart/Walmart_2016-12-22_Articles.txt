By Ben Levisohn Biography December 17, 2016 Nike (NKE), the company known for just doing it, stumbled in 2016. And it might not be able to get back on its feet in 2017. Nike’s route from “just do it” to “can’t do it” stemmed from its inability to keep pace with a changing footwear landscape. Consumer preference has shifted from Nike’s sports shoes to trendier styles, allowing competitors—Adidas (ADDYY) and Under Armour (UA), among them—to flourish in a way they haven’t in years.

Luckily for them, some retailers will be open with extended hours until Sunday, so folks needing to pick up a few extra presents will still have some time to take care of all their holiday needs before the holiday arrives. Read on for holiday hours at major retailers like Best Buy, Walmart, Target and more. Walmart: The superstore has faced a ton of backlash over the year for extending holiday shopping hours that started as early as 6 p.m. on Thanksgiving Day, forcing some workers to miss out on their own holiday celebration. This year, however, Walmart will try to spread a little yuletide cheer by not only remaining closed on Christmas day but also cutting store hours on Christmas Eve. In past years the store closed at 8 p.m. on Christmas Eve. This holiday season Walmart will close at 6 p.m. on Saturday and won’t reopen until Monday. Related Stories Last-Minute Tech Christmas Gifts Best Christmas Gaming Deals Best Buy: The electronics store extended shopping hours as of Thanksgiving and will remain open until 11 p.m. Friday. However, the store will only be open from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Christmas Eve and will remain closed on Sunday. Target: The store was open for business on Thanksgiving Day, but shoppers shouldn’t expect the same holiday hours for Christmas. Target closes at midnight on Friday and was scheduled to stay open from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. on Christmas Eve. The store was expected to be closed on Christmas day, but will reopen Monday at 7 a.m. Toys ‘R Us: Although it may be hard to snag some of the hottest toys of the season now – Hatchimals and other popular toys sold out not long after stores opened up on Black Friday – the toy retailer will remain open from 6 a.m. Friday until 9 p.m. Christmas Eve. Toys ‘R Us will be closed all day on Christmas. Join the Discussion Most Read Everything You Need To Know, Right Now.

A few stores will be open on Christmas Day, but you may be limited to buying candy, gift cards, and lottery tickets — and those are all great gifts, especially if the recipient cashes in on millions thanks to the Powerball ticket your bought them. Many convenience stores and pharmacies including 7-11, Speedway, CVS, Walgreens, and Cumberland Farms will be open on Sunday. Hours vary, but some stores are open 24-hours. And there’s a big surprise for anyone who needs groceries — The Balance reports that Albertson’s stores will be open 8 a.m. – 4 p.m. on Christmas Day. Restaurants open Christmas Day According to a previous report by the Inquisitr, a number of restaurants will be open on Christmas Day and that’s good news for folks who don’t want to cook. Although the always-popular Cracker Barrel will close at 2 p.m. on Christmas Eve and remain closed on Christmas, there are other options for cheap holiday dinners including Golden Corral and Hometown Buffet.

Rikki Hart and Donell Barron remain in the Palm Beach County Jail in lieu of $1,000 bail and are facing five counts of child neglect. A deputy found the family inside a Toyota during a routine patrol Saturday morning at the Walmart at Forest Hill Boulevard just east of Jog Road. Related Headlines 5 malnourished children found living in car at Walmart, deputies say Florida woman awakens to dead newborn in bed for second time Two of the children were diagnosed as “severely malnourished,” including a 14-year-old boy who weighed only 50 pounds when he was found. The children are now in the custody of the Florida Department of Children and Families. Timothy and Lorraine Motlow, who run the Helping Hands assistance program at 2930 Jog Road, provided the family with food, clothing and toys for nearly seven hours Saturday while Palm Beach County sheriff’s deputies sorted out the situation at a church next to the resource center. The Motlows said the children’s parents were “distraught” and that Barron kept asking, “How did it get this far?” Barron told deputies the family had been living in the car for about two months after they were evicted from their Port St. Lucie home in May. The couple told the Motlows that Hart had a miscarriage this year while 8 1/2 months pregnant and they “have not recovered from that.” “They are loving parents,” Timothy Motlow said of Hart and Barron, both 34. “They were doing all they can. The kids were happy and very loving with their parents. Things just snowballed for them.” Motlow said Hart and Barron did not realize the extent of their children’s poor health. Barron told deputies the children — ages 14, 8, 6, 5 and 4 — ate only vegetables and bread once a day. Lorraine Motlow said she was told by fire rescue workers that the 14-year-old boy would have died if he had remained in the car much longer. “We didn’t realize he was 14 because he was so small and tiny,” Lorraine Motlow said. The Motlow praised the work of deputies, saying the children were allowed to remain with their parents until they were taken to Palms West Hospital in Loxahatchee for evaluation. Hart and Barron remained behind and were arrested after the children departed. Barron made several bizarre comments, according to an arrest report. He is a “world citizen” with a given name as well as a “corporate name,” he told deputies. A blog compiled by the couple includes an “amendment to the State of Pennsylvania vital statistics” in which they claim to be members of the nation of Yammasee Imazighan. Barron told deputies that he is a Native American and “is not property of the U.S. or any corporation.” Robin Johnson, Hart’s mother, said her daughter was a good mother and added she and Hart’s father “were working diligently to make sure the children are safe.” Johnson declined further comment. “When you’re being taken by the police, hope seems to go out the window,” Timothy Motlow said. “But we shared with (Barron) that from this point forward, things can get better and we’re here to help them.” To that end, the Motlows and their volunteers at Helping Hands put together two bags of toys for the children and another sack filled with chips and goodies. They hope to have the gifts delivered to the children, who have been placed in foster care. “My heart goes out to them,” said Lorraine Motlow, who is a great grandmother. “I wish I could have taken those kids and brought them home.” The Motlows have been running Helping Hands, which helps struggling families get on their feet, since 2004. “They’re not the only family out there like that,” Lorraine Motlow said. © 2017 Cox Media Group.

On Dec. 20th, the president of the National Fraternal Order of Police (FOP), which is the largest police organization in the U.S., requested that Walmart cease selling tees and sweatshirts with the words “Black Lives Matter” and “Bulletproof” on the store’s website. That same night, Walmart “said it would remove the shirts which say”‘Bulletproof,” but not the “Black Lives Matter” shirts. FOP President Chuck Canterbury sent a letter to Walmart CEO C. Douglas McMillon advising him Walmart’s website was selling “offensive shirts and sweatshirts,” writing, “I urge you to prohibit the use of the Walmart name and website for the retail sale of these products.” He added: “I am concerned that allowing these articles to be sold in this way will damage your company’s good name amongst FOP members and other active and retired law enforcement officers.” Canterbury added, “Commercializing our differences will not help our local police and communities to build greater trust and respect for one another.” In response: Walmart issued a statement that said: “Like other online retailers, we have a marketplace with millions of items offered by third parties that includes Blue Lives Matter, Black Lives Matter and All Lives Matter merchandise. After hearing concerns from customers, we are removing the specific item with the ‘bulletproof’ reference.” The “bulletproof” shirts say “Bulletproof” with “Black Lives Matter” beneath that line. According to Chris Kappelman, the head buyer for Old Glory, which offers the shirts to Walmart, “Walmart had not contacted his company before removing some of their product. But he noted that Old Glory sells more than a half million shirts, including ‘All Lives Matter’ and ‘All Matter Matters,’ and they were not looking to offend anyone. He said they had removed the “Bulletproof” shirts from other third-party sites as well,” reported The Washington Post. The Fraternal Order of Police also followed up with a similar letter to Amazon.com.

Store hours for Dec. 24 By  Leada Gore | lgore@al.com AL.com Email the author Follow on Twitter on December 23, 2016 at 10:16 AM, updated December 23, 2016 at 7:40 PM Print Email Walmart will close at 6 p.m. on Christmas Eve.File photo/Gulflive.com  Most Walmart stores are open around-the-clock but the nation's largest retailer will be closing early on Christmas Eve. Walmart stores around the country will close at 6 p.m. Dec. 24, two hours earlier than the previous year. "Our associates work hard all year to make this holiday season special for our customers, and we appreciate what they do every day," said Judith McKenna, chief operating officer, Walmart U.S. "We also know that getting home on Christmas Eve to spend time with families is important. That's why this year we'll be closing at 6 p.m. on Christmas Eve." Customers who order an item available for pickup on line by 6 p.m. local time on Dec. 23 will be able to pick up their items before closing time on Dec. 24. Store pick-up is free but only available on select items. It's an increasingly population option with Walmart customers, with as many as 10 times more pickup orders taking place during the holidays compared to an average day. Walmart stores will reopen at 6 a.m. on Dec. 26. The retailer has stepped up its online presence this Christmas season and made efforts towards speeding up the in-store experience as well. In December, Walmart announced it would use existing employees as "Holiday Helpers" to assist with checkout procedures. The specially designated employees assisted customers in finding the shortest lines and with self-check out and directed new checkout lanes when needed. Walmart also utilized pick-up managers to speed up the in-store process.

MacMcCannTX.com. Dec 23, 2016 Share Tweet 0 Video via AL.com / Facebook An 89-year-old Pennsylvania man took a wrong turn on his way to store, and ended up 900 miles away in Alabama.  On Saturday, Jody Tarbutton got in his truck planning to go to the local Walmart to pick up some electrical supplies, according to WVTM. But it didn't work out as planned. The Walmart is about two miles away from Tarbutton's home in Boothwyn, Pennsylvania, a small town about 20 miles from Philadelphia. The weather was bad, and somewhere along the way he took a wrong turn. And then Tarbutton, who didn't have a cell phone, kept going. And going. And going.

He went on, "He didn't know where he was supposed to be, so the officers ran his license information and found out he was listed as missing and endangered in Pennsylvania." Tarbutton was taken to the police station, where officers contacted his family. Then, he was taken to a local hospital to be treated for dehydration and high blood pressure.  Tarbutton is now back home safe with his family, which Gatta called "a Christmas miracle," according to NBC Philadelphia.  The Associated Press reported that Gatta "said her father has never been clinically diagnosed with dementia and attributed his unexpected road trip to old age and forgetfulness."

A photo of the epic parking revenge outside the Biddeford Walmart was first shared on Facebook last weekend and it has since taken the Internet by storm, having been viewed more than 11million times. Matthew Mills, who snapped the viral image, wrote in a caption: 'This guy got a lesson in parking.' Parking revenge: Matthew Mills snapped this image of a car hogging two spots surrounded by a ring of carefully arranged shopping carts in Maine Mills’ photo depicts a small silver Nissan straddling a yellow line dividing two parking slots. The vehicle is hemmed in on three sides by about two dozen Walmart shopping carts perfectly lined up in three straight rows. Mills told Eyewitness News the owner of the car was said to have been a Walmart employee who slid into the spot after hitting a patch of ice and snow.

Two 'deadliest' police departments in US to be investigated in California Read more The shirt, which carries the words “Bulletproof: Black Lives Matter”, was removed from online sale by Walmart on Thursday, after the Fraternal Order of Police (FOP) said it was “offensive”. In an open letter, FOP president Chuck Canterbury appealed to Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos to support the FOP in “increasing the bonds of trust between the men and women of law enforcement and the communities they serve”. The shirt was still available for sale via Amazon.com on Friday. Amazon declined to comment. Speaking to the Guardian, Canterbury said he was not surprised, describing Amazon “as a pretty liberal marketer”. The issue was relevant, he said, because of the “amount of violence demonstrated at Black Lives Matter marches and the fact that eight police officers had been assassinated while protecting Black Lives Matter protests”. Canterbury said he was referring to officers who were shot in separate incidents in Dallas and Baton Rouge last summer. The gunmen in those shootings were not affiliated with the Black Lives Matter movement. In Dallas, a gunman shot dead five officers during an anti-violence protest. In Baton Rouge, three officers were killed in an ambush. Canterbury told the Guardian he believed nonetheless that anti-police rhetoric in the name of the protest group “had inspired people of feeble minds to strike out at police officers”. “It happened as a result of the rhetoric of different BLM groups,” he said. Messages seeking comment from prominent Black Lives Matter activists were not immediately returned. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Two women hold a sign at a protest against police brutality in the US. Photograph: Daniel Leal-Olivas/AFP/Getty Images In his open letter to Walmart, Canterbury accused it of allowing third-party sellers to profit from racial division. “Commercialising our differences will not help our local police and communities to build greater trust and respect for one another,” he wrote. “Turning a buck on strained relationships will not contribute to the healing process.” He added: “I wanted to let you know that my members are are very upset that you and Amazon are complicit in the sale of this offensive merchandise.” Walmart said in a statement that after “hearing concerns from customers” it had dropped the third-party sale of the “bulletproof” merchandise. Like other online retailers, it said, it would continue to offer third-party merchandise that carried protest and counter-protest slogans such as Black Lives Matter, Blue Lives Matter and All Lives Matter. The third-party vendor selling the “bulletproof” shirts was Connecticut-based Old Glory Merchandise. Calls to the company were not answered on Friday. Owner Glenn Morelli told CNN, however, that he had already decided to remove the shirt from his site. “It wasn’t a big seller at all,” he said. “The Blue Lives Matter sells more than the Black Lives Matter or bulletproof shirts combined. We don’t like to offend anybody.” He added: “You have to sell all different kinds of shirts. It’s hard to make everybody happy.” On Friday, Amazon customer reviews for “bulletproof” merchandise offered by one-third party merchant mirrored the divisive national debate over the Black Lives Matter movement. One reviewer, PhantomOfAmazon, wrote: “The slogan is divisive & misleading. Black Americans must come together to solve their issues in areas like Chicago, Detroit, Oakland, LA, etc.” Another, Vincent Alexander, commented: “Great shirt, unless you hate freedom of speech.” Killings by US police logged at twice the previous rate under new federal program Read more According to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, 64 US law enforcement officers have been shot and killed in 2016, the most in five years. The Counted, a Guardian project to record the number of people killed by law enforcement in the US, has recorded 1,045 such deaths in 2016. Last year, the total was 1,134. The Black Lives Matter movement has grown around such deaths, in high-profile cases often of unarmed African American men. Canterbury said “over 95%” of fatal shootings by law enforcement came during engagements with armed suspects. “There’s a big differences between shooting someone assassination-style while they’re enforcing the law and being shot while breaking the law and not complying with a lawful arrest,” he said. Guardian analysis of the 2015 figures showed young black men were nine times more likely than other Americans to be killed by police officers. A US government pilot program to count killings by police has recorded a sharply higher number of deaths than previous official efforts. Department of Justice officials have said their new method for counting “arrest-related deaths” should improve the “reliability, validity and comprehensiveness” of such information. Canterbury said FOP members would continue to apply pressure on retailers to drop such merchandise, “until Black Lives Matter makes statements that they do not approve of violence”.

Things to do in the Lehigh Valley this weekend News Breaking News New York weighs in on Wal-Mart's sale of ammo in Valley shooting spree Michael Engman/Getty Images/Nordic New York Public Advocate Letitia James filed a brief in Philadelphia County Court with 10 members of New York City Council and two state senators arguing a federal law giving gun and ammunition dealers immunity from lawsuits does not protect Wal-Mart because the sale was illegal.

(Michael Engman/Getty Images/Nordic) Peter HallOf The Morning Call New York watchdog joins effort to hold Walmart responsible for ammo used in Pa. killings. A New York City public watchdog has joined the families of three Lehigh Valley residents murdered in a July 2015 shooting spree in their effort to hold Wal-Mart responsible for allegedly selling the ammunition used in the killings to an underage customer. New York Public Advocate Letitia James filed a brief in Philadelphia County Court with 10 members of New York City Council and two state senators arguing a federal law giving gun and ammunition dealers immunity from lawsuits does not protect Wal-Mart because the sale was illegal. City officials have an interest in the outcome of the case because Pennsylvania is one of six states on the "Iron Pipeline" where the majority of illegally obtained guns used in crimes in New York originate, the Dec. 20 filing says. "The activities that defendants are alleged to be involved in are illegal and against the public interest in all states," the filing says, noting that such practices hinder regulation of gun ownership and contribute to crime in the city. Wal-Mart says the suit should be dismissed because the federal Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act bars claims for negligence against firearms and ammunition manufacturers and retailers. The lawsuit alleges Wal-Mart and its employees were negligent in selling a box of .38-caliber ammunition to then 20-year-old Robert A. Jourdain because he was too young to buy handgun ammunition under federal law. Police: Man charged in Easton, Allentown killing spree said devil spoke to him Laurie Mason Schroeder The white Mercedes sport utility vehicle crawled down Lehigh Street in Easton just after 3 a.m. July 5. Todd West was in the back seat, holding a loaded revolver. West, an Allentown police detective testified Tuesday, saw 22-year-old Kory Ketrow walking on the sidewalk. West ordered the driver... The white Mercedes sport utility vehicle crawled down Lehigh Street in Easton just after 3 a.m. July 5. Todd West was in the back seat, holding a loaded revolver. West, an Allentown police detective testified Tuesday, saw 22-year-old Kory Ketrow walking on the sidewalk. West ordered the driver... (Laurie Mason Schroeder) After buying the ammunition in the wee hours of July 5, 2015, Jourdain joined gunman Todd West in a sport utility vehicle driven by Kareem Mitchell, authorities say. The three men drove to Easton, where West used the ammunition Jourdain bought to kill 22-year-old Kory Ketrow just steps from his Lehigh Street apartment, according to police. They then drove to Allentown, where West fatally shot city residents Francine Ramos, 32, and Trevor Gray, 21, as they sat in a car at North Sixth and Greenleaf streets, police say. West, 24, pleaded guilty in Lehigh County Court to the murders and was sentenced in October to three consecutive life sentences. He is also charged in four New Jersey homicides. Mitchell, 24, of Newark, N.J., and Jourdain, now 22, of Easton, are scheduled to stand trial on homicide charges early next year. Lehigh County DA Jim Martin discusses killing and crime spree in Allentown Robert A. Jourdain, 20, of Easton; Todd West, 22, of Elizabeth, N.J.; and Kareem Mitchell, 23, of Newark, N.J., face three counts of homicide in the shooting deaths of two men and one woman in Allentown and Easton, along with charges in an attempted homicide and several robberies. Robert A. Jourdain, 20, of Easton; Todd West, 22, of Elizabeth, N.J.; and Kareem Mitchell, 23, of Newark, N.J., face three counts of homicide in the shooting deaths of two men and one woman in Allentown and Easton, along with charges in an attempted homicide and several robberies. See more videos Attorney Matthew Casey, who represents the Lehigh Valley families, said that while the New York officials' support is welcome, the claims are not political. "It is, plainly and simply, a case of egregiously reckless conduct on the part of one of the world's largest corporations that resulted in horrific injuries and the ultimate death of totally innocent citizens of our commonwealth," Casey said. But the public advocate's friend of the court brief says the outcome of the case will clarify the standards to which gun and ammunition sellers are held, which is significant for residents of Pennsylvania and neighboring states. The public advocate is an elected office in New York City government with the responsibility to identify systemic problems and recommend solutions, and has the power to hold hearings and draft legislation. The brief cites an analysis by the New York attorney general that found a majority of guns that were likely purchased to be sold or transferred illegally came from Pennsylvania, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia and Florida. Pennsylvania was the source of 13 percent of those weapons, behind only Virginia, where 15 percent of New York's likely trafficked crime guns originated. The attorney general's report notes the six Iron Pipeline states have less stringent gun laws than New York. Among them, only Pennsylvania requires a background check and only North Carolina requires a permit before buying a handgun. In preliminary objections to the lawsuit, Wal-Mart says the claims of the victims' families don't fall within the narrow exceptions under the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act that allow gun and ammunition dealers to be sued. The Bentonville, Ark.-based retailer notes the law bars suits for harm resulting solely from the criminal misuse of guns and ammunition. Wal-Mart also argues that the families cannot prove their claims that the sale was negligent. peter.hall@mcall.com Twitter @phall215 610-820-6581 Privacy Policy Copyright © 2017, The Morning Call Homicide Shootings GRAPHIC: New Jersey and Pennsylvania shooting spree Judge: Ammo lawsuit tied to Valley slayings going back to Philly court PICTURES: Lehigh County DA Jim Martin discusses killing and crime spree in Allentown Prosecutor: 'Horrific' shooting spree left 4 dead in Jersey, 3 in the Lehigh Valley Police: Three men fired randomly during Sunday killing spree in Allentown, Easton Breaking Popular Obits Biz Cycle Be An Angel Sports Video/Photos Classifieds 27°

HAVERHILL, Mass. — Christmas came early for the one hundred children attending the after-school care program at the YMCA in Haverhill, a small Massachusetts city close to the New Hampshire border. The Cafua Family Charitable Foundation, part of the largest privately owned Dunkin’ Donuts franchisee in the U.S., helped spread holiday cheer by presenting each child with $100 Walmart gift cards. "This is really exciting," said Rylee Spear, 9. "When my mother takes me here I see all the toys and I wish I could get one, but she usually tells me we are just there to get soap or something like that." Company owners, brothers Mark, David and Gregory Cafua told children they could buy whatever they wanted for themselves or anyone on their lists, at a Walmart in Plaistow, New Hampshire, where a special shopping night had been arranged on Monday.  Mark Cafua said he and his brothers were particularly touched after learning about some of the children. "We have six children from one family who recently lost their father," he said. About 70 or so Cafua employees along with YMCA staff waited with shopping carts decorated with green and red helium balloons, and along with Santa Claus, welcomed the children as they disembarked two school buses.  From 4 to 6 p.m., each child was paired with a Cafua Management Company employee, with CEO Mark Cafua leading the charge and YMCA regional Executive Director Tracy Fuller and YMCA of the North Shore CEO Chris Lovasco joining in to lend a hand. "In my 20 years working for the nonprofit YMCA, this is one of the coolest ways to give back to the community," Lovasco said. Shopping carts rapidly filled with toys, such as Pokemon characters and Num Noms Art Cart playsets, which Ariela Jimenez, 8, picked out for herself.  "I'm also shopping for my mom and dad," Ariela said. Isaac Acevedo, 9, studied the image on a box of Lego pieces before his attention was drawn to Star Wars toys. "I like this," Isaac said about a foot-tall Darth Vader action figure he picked out.  Their adult shopping guides kept track of how much they had left on their gift cards. "I'm looking for fashion boots," Angela Tejada told her guide. Caleb Carroll, 7, selected a Five Night's at Freddy's plush cupcake along with two Yo-kai watches and accessories. "I never had $100 before," Caleb said. "I almost couldn't sleep last night thinking about coming here." While the other little shoppers were wandering from aisle to aisle, Isabella Lombard, 6, was trying out a bicycle with training wheels. "My bike is rusty and doesn't work very well," said Isabella, who noted that she was also in need of a bicycle helmet. Jyzaiah Ferreira, 12, reached for an XBox Live gift card for himself, then asked his adult shopping guide how much he would have left as he wanted to buy Christmas presents for his mother, father and younger brother. "This has never happened to me before," Jyzaiah said. "I was going to use my birthday money to buy presents, but now I can keep saving it." Samantha Ehlers, 7, asked her shopping guide if she had enough left to donate $35 to a charity, after picking out a Disney Lion Guard Training Lair Playset, some Squinkies Do Drops characters and a Little Live Pets Tweet Talking Bird for herself, in addition to a Dinosaur Train character she planned to donate to the Toys for Tots program. "I want to donate to a charity, but I'm not sure which one," Samantha said. Some children wandered into the footwear and clothing departments, such as Ellie Cosme, 10, who was busy picking out a set of pajamas and slippers for herself while her younger brother Gabriel had just about finished filling a shared shopping cart with toys. "I was good all year and at my parent teacher conference, my mom said she was very proud of me," Ellie said before turning her attention to gifts she planned to get for her parents. Mark Cafua said his company operates about 300 Dunkin' Donut franchise locations throughout New England and Florida. "The goal of our 100 for 100 program is to spread joy, especially to the youngest members of our communities, during this most special time of year," said Mark Cafua. "We truly value our partnership with the YMCA of the North Shore, as it has provided us with the opportunity to not only reach those most in need of Christmas cheer, but also to engage our employees in meaningful programs within their own communities." Cafua said that he and his brothers have hosted similar shopping sprees for deserving children in other states where they operate, but this was the first time for Haverhill.  He said his company partnered with the Plaistow Walmart as it was a good fit for the children, who had expressed interest in not only toys, but in clothing and household items many of them planned to give as gifts on Christmas. "The holidays are especially important as we explore additional ways to help those in need,” Fuller said. “We are so grateful for Cafua Management and this wonderful 100 for 100 event. We appreciate their incredible support of so many of our programs, including camp, road races, and our financial assistance program. Their generosity is a true testament to their commitment to joining us in strengthening the communities we serve.”  Leading up to the event, the children created wish lists during their Y after school program. Fuller said Walmart management was helpful in assisting the Y and Cafua teams to ensure a smooth and fun experience for everyone involved.

Orders have been placed by over 300 growers supplying Walmart with a variety of fresh produce items. “Walmart chooses to use Wood Grain RPCs to deliver produce for a variety of reasons,” said Shawn Baldwin, SVP Produce, Floral, Global Food Sourcing, Walmart USA. “They have better ventilation, they’re ergonomically designed and very easy to use. And, our customers really like the new Wood Grain RPCs because they look more like a farmers market or roadside fruit stand which provides a level of comfort during the shopping experience.” “We are proud to partner with Walmart and its fresh produce suppliers to provide them with innovative, efficient, cost-effective and sustainable reusable packaging that transitions easily to in-store display,” said Daniel Walsh, President of IFCO North America. “Surpassing the 11 million Wood Grain RPC threshold so quickly is an impressive accomplishment made possible through strong collaboration between Walmart, the grower community and IFCO.” IFCO Wood Grain RPCs are used to ship fresh produce to Walmart under an agreement reached with the world’s largest retailer in October, 2015. The RPCs were designed to Walmart specifications and incorporated feedback received from the grower community. Like all IFCO RPCs, the Wood Grain RPCs are more efficient, protect and cool product better and are more environmentally sustainable than one-way packaging. IFCO has a strong commitment to supporting local economies, local companies and local workers in the marketplaces where it does business whenever possible. In the United States, IFCO’s Wood Grain RPCs are 100% sourced and manufactured in America and meet the Federal Trade Commission’s standard for its “Made in the USA” country of origin label. In addition, IFCO Wood Grain RPCs are cleaned and sanitized at one of six US service centers throughout their life cycle. Discussion Be the first to comment on this article!

Black Lives Matter."The national Fraternal Order of Police wrote to the retailer on Tuesday asking it to pull the shirts. Last week, an article on the right-wing web site Breitbart complained that Walmart dropped items that displayed the Confederate flag but still sold the "bulletproof" items. Walmart has agreed to stop selling t-shirts and hooded sweatshirts online that read “Bulletproof. Black Lives Matter.” The national Fraternal Order of Police wrote to the retailer on Tuesday asking it to pull the shirts. Last week, an article on the right-wing web site Breitbart complained that Walmart dropped items that displayed the Confederate flag but still sold the “bulletproof” items. Walmart (WMT) wasn’t actually selling the “Bulletproof. Black Lives Matter.” clothes itself, but they were available for purchase on its website via a third-party merchant. “Like other online retailers, we have a marketplace with millions of items offered by third parties that includes Blue Lives Matter, Black Lives Matter and All Lives Matter merchandise,” said a Walmart spokesman. “After hearing concerns from customers, we are removing the specific item with the ‘bulletproof’ reference.” Walmart’s move satisfied the police union, which does not object to the phrase “Black Lives Matters” by itself, according to James Pasco, the group’s executive director. “The bulletproof thing goes to the new assertiveness of some violence prone individuals to take action directly against police. We find it offensive for that reason,” said Pasco. Pasco added that the police union had yet to reach out to the third party vendor, Old Glory, that sells the bulletproof items. But Old Glory owner Glenn Morelli said he’s already decided to take down the shirt from his site as well. “It wasn’t a big seller at all. The Blue Lives Matter sells more than the Black Lives Matter or bulletproof shirts combined,” Morelli said. “We don’t like to offend anybody.” He said his company offers more than 500,000 different kinds of shirts and sweatshirts on its site. “When you sell that many, you have to sell all different kinds of shirts,” he said. “It’s hard to make everybody happy.” Filed in: News Suggest a correction × Suggest A Correction Your name Your email Report a typo or grammatical error Cancel Share this: Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest LinkedIn Email High Five See the positive news of the day!

Black Lives Matter." The national Fraternal Order of Police wrote to the retailer on Tuesday asking it to pull the shirts. Last week, an article on the right-wing web site Breitbart complained that Walmart dropped items that displayed the Confederate flag but still sold the "bulletproof" items. Walmart (WMT) wasn't actually selling the "Bulletproof. Black Lives Matter." clothes itself, but they were available for purchase on its website via a third-party merchant. "Like other online retailers, we have a marketplace with millions of items offered by third parties that includes Blue Lives Matter, Black Lives Matter and All Lives Matter merchandise," said a Walmart spokesman. "After hearing concerns from customers, we are removing the specific item with the 'bulletproof' reference." Related: Walmart trims its Christmas Eve hours Walmart's move satisfied the police union, which does not object to the phrase "Black Lives Matters" by itself, according to James Pasco, the group's executive director. "The bulletproof thing goes to the new assertiveness of some violence prone individuals to take action directly against police. We find it offensive for that reason," said Pasco. Pasco added that the police union had yet to reach out to the third party vendor, Old Glory, that sells the bulletproof items. But Old Glory owner Glenn Morelli said he's already decided to take down the shirt from his site as well. "It wasn't a big seller at all. The Blue Lives Matter sells more than the Black Lives Matter or bulletproof shirts combined," Morelli said. "We don't like to offend anybody." He said his company offers more than 500,000 different kinds of shirts and sweatshirts on its site. "When you sell that many, you have to sell all different kinds of shirts," he said. "It's hard to make everybody happy."

Donell Barron and Rikki Hart,  both 34, were arrested Sunday outside the store in Greenacres, Florida, according to the Palm Beach Post.  An arrest report says the deputy looked inside the Toyota after detecting a strong odor 'similar to that of homeless camps.'  Barron told the deputy the family lost their home and lived in motels until they ran out of money two months ago. Scroll down for video  Donell Barron (left) and Rikki Hart were arrested after five children were found living in a Toyota in a Wal-Mart parking lot in Florida He also told the deputy the kids bathed at a nearby park. The children are ages 14, 8, 6, 5 and 4. The police report blocked out the relationship between the couple and the children. Authorities say the children are underweight, but the 14-year-old boy's bones 'were clearly visible.' He reportedly only weighed five pounds more than his eight-year-old sibling and had unusually high blood pressure. An officer said he smelled a stench like a 'homeless camp' inside the car when he found the children, who were malnourished  Deputies said the children only ate bread and salad once a day and had not seen a doctor in years.  Unlike the children, the report said that the couple seemed healthy and clean. The pair had been evicted  twice in the past five years from homes in Port St. Lucie in for failure to pay rent.  The pair run a blog that purports to offer healthy eating services as well as a budget, saving and investment program The couple have a blog called Holistically Beautiful for 'those interested in a holistic and balanced lifestyle.' On the blog, Barron says he has a 'Master's Degree in Rehab Science/Substance Abuse' and Hart says she has her 'Bachelor's is [sic] Speech Communication and has a background in Banking, Dance Therapy, Childbirth Preparation.' Hart's LinkedIn page says she graduated from Clarion University in Pennsylvania. Barron reportedly told cops that he was Native American and 'is not property of the US or any corporation.'  Despite their history of failure to pay rent, the couple offer a 'Money Matters Initiative Program' that offered recipients counseling on budgeting and investing.

Share this article Share They also offer a program on eating healthy. Additionally, Hart says she is a doula. 'As a wife and a mother of 5 children, I understand the importance of having support while being pregnant and through the childbirth process,' she wrote on LinkedIn. The Department of Children and Families took custody of the children. The report doesn't say whether Baron and Hart have lawyers. They face charges of child neglect and are being held in Palm Beach County Jail in lieu of $1,000 bail.        Read more: Five malnourished children found living in car at Walmart cbs12.com/news/l...

Its final decision? Ceasing investing city tax dollars in all corporate bonds. At least for a few months. In a somewhat dramatic turn (and amid a reluctance among city council members to stand specifically against some companies) the council promptly turned what was supposed to be a hearing on several corporate bad actors into a decision to direct the city's treasurer to cease corporate investments altogether. The move was partly choreographed—advocates pushing for divestment from private prisons had been told of a deal before this afternoon's hearing. And the decision neatly allowed the city council to sidestep singling out companies like Wells Fargo and Caterpillar, which community members have pressed especially hard be put on the city's "Do Not Buy" list. Those two companies were among a list of nine corporations that a city committee recommended Portland officials rule out for tens of millions in city investments. Others included Walmart, Credit Suisse, and JP Morgan Chase. Last month, the Mercury examined the push to divest from Wells Fargo because of its role in funding private prison companies. Headed into this afternoon's hearing, it looked like most of those companies wouldn't be added to the Do Not Buy list. After a hearing on November 30, Commissioner Steve Novick had introduced a resolution that would have placed Credit Suisse, Nestlé, and Walmart on the list (pending council approval). Last Friday, Novick told the Mercury those were the companies he felt were most defensible to have on the list. (Novick noted that only around 50 companies issue bonds that meet Portland's strict criteria for investment, and that adding nine of them to the list would have meaningfully cut the city's options.) But something changed. At the outset of this afternoon's hearing, Novick introduced an amendment that would add Wells Fargo and Caterpillar to the list (Caterpillar was a target for its role selling weaponized bulldozers to Israel, which uses them to raze settlements in the West Bank). Then Fritz introduced another amendment directing City Treasurer Jennifer Cooperman "to suspend direct investments of cash assets in corporate debt securities" until council had adopted another investment policy next year. "You’ve won," Fritz told people who'd come to speak at the hearing—many of them pressing divestment in specific corporations. "We aren’t going to invest in things you don’t like." That message wasn't readily embraced by folks in the crowd for a couple reasons. First: Fritz's amendment doesn't forever preclude the city from investing in corporate bonds. Rather it directs the treasurer to amend the city's investment criteria to ensure corporations meet "a to-be-determined minimum rating at the time of purchase," as determined by an "environmental-, social- and governance-based investment research provider." Since no one knows what that rating will be, no one can conclusively say Walmart or Credit Suisse or Wells Fargo would be disqualified. "Let’s not repeat work that’s already been done," said Jamie Trinkle, a research coordinator with the group Enlace, which has pushed divestment from Wells Fargo. "What you’ve set in motion is powerful and visionary, but it's not worth the paper it's written on if you don’t implement it." More pressing for folks in the audience: By applying to all corporations, Fritz's amendment didn't end up slapping the wrist of very specific corporations that might be doing wrong. "Saying we’re not going to buy any companies is very different from singling out the worst of the worst," one woman told city council. Council wasn't moved, declining to add the companies Novick had put forward for the Do Not Buy list and instead unanimously ordering that the city stop purchasing corporate securities (that move doesn't have any bearing on corporate investments that have yet to mature). "We really need to be very careful about how we move forward," Fritz said. Of course, the decision will come at a cost. Cooperman, the city treasurer, told council the city makes between $4.5 million and $5 million more via corporate investments each year than it would investing in lower yield products (like treasury bonds). Cooperman plainly did not like this solution (even though the city didn't invest in corporate bonds until 2009). When asked by Commissioner Nick Fish whether ceasing buying corporate bonds for a time might present less risk, she batted the suggestion aside. "There is an opportunity lost by not investing in something Oregon state law allows us to do," she said. The decision created a situation where Novick's last vote as a city commissioner somewhat undid one of his earlier efforts. He was the person who suggested the city develop a socially responsible investment policy, with a citizen committee that helped identify bad actors. Under Fritz's amendment, that process will be effectively automated, eliminating the need for a committee, according to Fritz's office. "As far as I know, this is unique in the country," Novick said before casting his vote, noting that while other cities might have blanket policies, they hadn't adopted "specific criteria" for not investing in companies. "We’ve learned why they don’t," he said. "It’s hard." 1 Good Morning, News: Charlie Hales, Weed Delivery, and 911 Flaws Vice Is Ditching Comments, Too. Santa Must Be Real After All!

(Screenshot from Walmart website) Print Email Cliff Pinckard, cleveland.com By Cliff Pinckard, cleveland.com The Plain Dealer Email the author | Follow on Twitter on December 21, 2016 at 10:03 PM, updated December 21, 2016 at 10:06 PM comments CLEVELAND, Ohio -- Complaints from a nationwide police union prompted Walmart on Wednesday to remove T-shirts and sweat shirts for sale on its website that say "Bulletproof: Black Lives Matter." Chuck Canterbury, president of the Fraternal Order of Police, wrote an open letter on Tuesday night asking Walmart to remove "Bulletproof" items from its website, CBS News reports.  Canterbury wrote that Walmart has been supportive of police in the past, but said he worried having the items available would "damage your company's good name amongst FOP members and other active and retired law enforcement officers." "At a time of year when we as a nation and indeed, as a world, should be coming together in hopes of peace on Earth and goodwill toward men, these third-party sellers are profiting from racial division." According to the Los Angeles Times, the Black Lives Matter items are sold on Walmart's website by Old Glory Merchandise, a music and entertainment apparel dealer out of Connecticut. The dealer also sells "Blue Lives Matter" apparel. While Walmart has dropped the "Bulletproof" shirts, it will continue to allow items that say Black Lives Matter only, CNN reports. "Like other online retailers, we have a marketplace with millions of items offered by third parties that includes Blue Lives Matter, Black Lives Matter and All Lives Matter merchandise," a Walmart spokesman said, according to CNN. "After hearing concerns from customers, we are removing the specific item with the 'bulletproof' reference." James Pasco, the FOP's executive director, tells CNN the police union is satisfied with Walmart's action and does not object to Black Lives Matter by itself. "The bulletproof thing goes to the new assertiveness of some violence prone individuals to take action directly against police. We find it offensive for that reason," Pasco said. Glenn Morelli, the owner of Old Glory Merchandise, tells CNN the "Bulletproof" merchandise was not a big seller, saying Blue Lives Matter is a much more popular shirt.

(Alec Tabak/for New York Daily News) BY Erin Durkin NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Wednesday, December 21, 2016, 10:43 PM Public Advocate Letitia James and other city pols filed a brief that backed up victims suing Walmart for selling bullets used to kill three people. In an amicus brief filed this week, the officials argue Walmart should not be protected by a federal law that generally shields gun makers and sellers, because the store broke the law by selling the ammo to someone under 21. “Weak gun laws and irresponsible practices by gun makers and retailers have brought death and destruction across our country,” James said. “This court action will hold Walmart accountable for its negligence in the deaths of three innocent people.” The Pennsylvania case stems from the murders of three people last year, using bullets bought at Walmart by 20-year-old Robert Jourdain. The families charge Walmart failed to check the man’s age, even though it’s illegal to sell handgun ammo to people under 21, and he was visibly drunk at the time.

Liz Krueger and eight City Council members, who argue New York has a stake in the case because so many of the guns used to shoot people here come from out of state, especially Pennsylvania. An estimated 90% of guns recovered in New York City come from out of state — and 8% of guns used in crimes in the city from 2010 to 2015 were from Pennsylvania, according to the state attorney general. James and another group of city officials previously filed a brief in the case arguing that it should be heard in state court, instead of being moved to federal court as Walmart wanted. City pols argue the federal laws don't apply to parties who break the law and are found negligent. (CHARLES KRUPA/AP) The families won that motion and were able to sue in state court, but Walmart is now trying to get the case dismissed on the grounds they’re shielded by the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act. 'Witch' murdered in Pennsylvania Dutch country over hex The pols argue in the brief that that immunity does not apply to retailers that break the law and are found negligent, and that Walmart violated the Gun Control Act of 1968 by selling the bullets to an underage customer. "Walmart continues to extend its condolences to the families for their loss. The Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act limits lawsuits against sellers and manufacturers and doesn’t allow the claims raised against us in the plaintiffs’ complaint," said Walmart spokesman Randy Hargrove.

Black Lives Matter," a former circuit judge and police officer argued Wednesday. In an interview on "The O'Reilly Factor," Alex Ferrer, former Florida circuit court judge and police officer, applauded Walmart's decision to stop the sales after the national Fraternal Order of Police argued "third party sellers are profiting from racial division." "If you are a police officer, of course you find it offensive.... I don't find Black Lives Matter to be offensive in any way or racist because they only focus on black lives or because they don't focus on black on black crime. … I disagree with their premise… [that] police officers are unfairly targeting African-Americans. That's that is simply not true. It's not supported by any FBI statistics." He added that by putting on the t-shirt, the implication is that "cops are all shooting us – here is a shirt that says bullet proof. That's why cops are offended by the t-shirt." Radio talk show host and journalist Jamila Bey argued the t-shirt flap was a "distraction from issues that really matter." "American citizens have the right to free speech," she added. "That also means that we have the right to buy shirts with inflammatory staples on them. When police are saying 'you can't say that, ' I've got a problem...."

Vanne Alice Marie Heller No ATVs on Streets Hilbert to Replace School Roof Units Dedering Celebrates 102nd Birthday Fraud Case Stopped by CPD Dec 22, 2016Featured, News0 By Times Journal Staff Photo courtesy pixelbay A scammer with more than 150 credit cards was recently apprehended by the Chilton Police Department. The Chilton Police Department is currently working on an on-going investigation for more than a month involving major credit card fraud. “The same type of cases that happen in big towns also happen in small towns. It’s just not as frequent,” said Craig Plehn, chief of the Chilton Police Department. “Unfortunately most smaller town police departments do not have the man power, training, or time available to thoroughly investigate these types of cases. That’s why all Departments especially in this area have establish a good working relationship that we all can work together to solve these types of cases.” On Nov. 12 the Chilton Police Department received a call from a security advisor from a bank advising someone was currently at the Chilton Walmart buying $100 iTunes gift cards with stolen account information.  Officers responded to the Chilton Walmart, reviewed surveillance video and were able to give out the description of the suspect.  The suspect was stopped leaving Walmart and was found in possession of 170 credit cards, many without names just containing the magnetic strip and the security chip.  The suspect was also found to be in possession of a laptop computer and a card re-coder.  The suspect was also in possession of 34 iTunes gift cards totaling $3,400.  The complainant advised that the bank had lost over $20,000 in the last couple of days from individuals using stolen account information and purchasing iTunes gift cards.  The investigation has revealed that the suspect rented a car in North Carolina drove up to Wisconsin and hit numerous Walmart stores on the way to Chilton.  Search warrants have been done on the 168 credit cards and will be done on the laptop, iPhones and GPS to determine how many more stores were hit that the Chilton Police Department is not aware of.  The suspect has been charged with credit card theft, credit card forgery, credit card fraud, and eight counts of fraudulent use of credit cards.  Assisting the Chilton Police Department with this investigation was the Calumet County Sheriff’s Department, the Wisconsin Department of Criminal Investigations (DCI), the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI), and the Sheboygan County Sheriff’s Department.

Zoey was shopping with her family when Kociba surprised her with a gift, but she began crying when the Walmart cashier bagged the toy. Kociba came to the rescue and removed the dancing pink robot from the package. See page 2. BAD AXE — For the heroes, it’s a chance to give back to the community. For the young participants, it’s a chance to give to the ones they love. Area police, first responders, firefighters and other everyday lifesavers helped kids buy Christmas gifts during the annual Shop with a Hero program Thursday, Dec. 15 at Walmart. Event coordinator Dave Rothe, chief of the Bad Axe and Ubly police departments, said the first responders look forward to the yearly chance to help a child have a more joyful holiday. “The heroes who shop with the kids, they’re public servants. I think it’s second nature for them to want to help in any way they can. This is a great opportunity for them to do that,” he said. Harbor Beach Elementary School student Maria Potter reads her shopping list to Harbor Beach Firefighter Jason Lermont during Shop with a Hero. Photos by Kelly Krager This year, 56 children from area schools took part in the program, and 70 heroes showed up to help. Many heroes, Rothe said, opened their wallets to supplement the $50 each child received through the program. “That’s not unexpected, to see them do that. It’s part of who they are,” Rothe said. The Bad Axe Police Department collected approximately $2,500 in advance for this year’s program, and Rothe said he was given another $200 at Walmart during the event. Since there were too many volunteers to match each with a child, some heroes were given gift cards and were sent throughout the store to surprise children shopping with family. Clayton Galloway, 9, of North Huron Elementary School, shops in the toy aisle with Ubly Police Officer Matt Blaine. Bad Axe Fire Department Captain Justin Kociba helped 3-year-old Zoey Noaker, of Owendale, select and purchase a pink doll that sings and dances. “We’re just finding random kids and giving them a little Christmas present,” Kociba said. The program was also an opportunity for older students to learn the value of giving their time to benefit the community. Ascent High School Principal Russ Clark said the event was one of several the school’s students volunteer for during the year. “We always try to get them out of their little circle and little box, knowing that there are people who are worse off than they are themselves,” he said. The students also “adopted” nine families in the Bad Axe community, helping each have a more joyous holiday season. The Bad Axe Police Department accepts donations year round for the Shop with a Hero program. To donate to next year’s event, contact Rothe at 989-269-9242.

Fearless Muckraking Since 1993 Home Articles Recent Articles Magazine Current Issue Back Issues Subscribe Subscriber Access Subscribe Donate Archives Search Authors About JOIN LIST Books T-shirts podcasts FAQs December 22, 2016 The Scandal of Vast Inequality in Retirement Pay by Lawrence Wittner by Tweet Email Cato the Elder, a Roman senator and historian, once remarked:  “Cessation of work is not accompanied by cessation of expenses.”  For centuries, retirees have been aware of this unfortunate fact, which led them to demand and, in many cases, secure old age pensions to help provide financial security during their “golden years.”  But as indicated in a recently-released report by the Institute for Policy Studies (IPS), the financial security of retiring corporate CEOs is far, far greater than the financial security of average Americans. According to the extensively researched IPS report, A Tale of Two Retirements, 100 corporate CEOs possess company retirement funds totaling $4.7 billion―an amount equivalent to the entire retirement savings of 41 percent of U.S. families (50 million families, including 116 million Americans).  The retirement funds of these 100 CEOs are also equivalent to those of 75 percent of Latino families, of 59 percent of African-American families, of 55 percent of female-headed households, and of 44 percent of white working class households. Indeed, the top 100 CEO nest eggs, if averaged, would generate a $253,088 monthly retirement check to these 100 individuals for the rest of their lives.  By contrast, workers who had 401(k) pension plans at the end of 2013 had only enough in these plans to pay them an average monthly benefit of $101.  Of course, these were the lucky ones.  Among workers 56 to 61 years old, 39 percent had no employer-sponsored retirement plan at all, and would likely depend on Social Security, which pays an average of $1,239 per month, for retirement security. Of course, these are only averages.  When one looks at individuals, the contrasts are even starker.  Glenn Renwick, the Progressive Insurance Company’s CEO who retired in 2016, receives a monthly retirement check from his company for $1,035,733.  Among Walmart’s 1.5 million employees, fewer than two-thirds have a company-sponsored retirement plan and, if they do, it will pay them, on average, only $131 per month.  But Walmart’s CEO, Doug McMillon can expect to receive at least $360,000 per month―more than 2,700 times the amount a typical Walmart worker with a 401(k) account can expect.  And there’s also CEO David Cote of Honeywell―a company that has locked out its workers from its factories in Green Island, NY and South Bend, IN for seven months for rejecting a contract that eliminated workers’ pensions―who receives a monthly retirement check from the company for $908,712. Or take the case of John Hammergreen, CEO of the McKesson corporation, a drug wholesaling giant.  A few months after Hammergreen arrived at McKesson in 1996, the company froze its employee pension fund, closing it to workers who came there in 1997.  Even so, the company launched a lavish Executive Benefit Retirement Account that enriched Hammergreen’s pension with an average of $22,000 a day for the next 20 years.  Thus, today he receives a monthly retirement check from the company for $782,339. Things were not always like this.  From 1946 to 1980, a combination of union action and government policy led to the expansion of pension benefits for American workers.  By 1980, 46 percent of private sector workers were covered by defined benefit pensions.  But, in the following decades, declining union strength, corporate attacks on pension funds, and government action resulted in a severe erosion of worker retirement security.  By 2011, only 18 percent of private sector workers were covered by defined benefit plans. As demonstrated by the authors of the IPS report, the growth of economic inequality in retirement provisions resulted from rigging things in favor of CEOS through new rules for pensions, taxes, and executive compensation.   “Since more than half of compensation is now tied to the company’s stock price,” the authors note, “CEOs have a powerful personal incentive for slashing worker retirement benefits in order to boost the short-term bottom line.  Every dollar not spent on employee retiree security is money in the CEO’s pocket.” Although changes in public policy could close the widening pension gap, such changes do not seem likely to occur while a zealously pro-corporate party controls the White House, Congress, and the courts.  Indeed, as the authors point out, thanks to the shielding of enormous CEO income in tax-deferred accounts, Fortune 500 CEOs will see very substantial gains in their retirement checks if President Trump succeeds in implementing his plan to slash the top marginal income tax rate. It’s possible that, in the long run, the rising tide of retirement insecurity will spark a revolt challenging the severe economic inequality between corporate CEOs and their American workers.  Until then, however, it’s tempting to propose updating Jonathan Swift’s eighteenth century satirical suggestion, made in A Modest Proposal, that poverty among the poor might be alleviated by selling their babies as food for the rich.  Perhaps, in twenty-first century America, retirement insecurity might be alleviated by selling elderly workers to the corporate rich, who could use them for the burgers sold by their fast food companies.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Derek Hawkins December 22, 2016 The parents of a Florida woman found living in a car with her five children and their father told WPTV "she took care of" and loved her children, but they are not sure how the family got to this point. (WPTV) The deputy said he was on a routine patrol in Greenacres, Fla., Saturday morning when he spotted the blue Toyota in a Walmart parking lot. It wasn’t the look of the vehicle that caught his attention but the smell emanating from it — an odor “similar to that of homeless camps,” he said. Inside was a family of seven. The parents seemed healthy, police said, but their five children, ranging in age from 4 to 14, were filthy, fatigued and so malnourished that their bones were protruding from under their skin, according to WPTV. The oldest reportedly weighed a mere 50 pounds, just 5 pounds more than his 8-year-old sibling. The parents, Donell Barron and Rikki Hart, both 34, were arrested Saturday on charges of child neglect, according to WPTV. As of Wednesday evening, they were being held in the Palm Beach County Jail in lieu of $1,000 bail, the Palm Beach Post reported. It was not clear Wednesday if they had hired defense attorneys. The Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office told local media that the children, all of whom were described as “underweight,” were taken to a hospital, where at least one of them was treated for unusually high blood pressure. The five kids are now in custody of the Florida Department of Children and Families, the Palm Beach Post reported. Police said they took some of the children out to eat at McDonald’s, where they “ravenously ate the meals, as if they had not been fed in quite some time.” When interviewed by the sheriff’s office, Barron gave a grim account of how the family wound up living out of their car. According to the Palm Beach Post, Barron told police that they had been evicted from their home in Port St. Lucie about a year ago and had spent about 10 months hopping from one hotel to another before they ran out of money. They had lived in the car for the past two months, he told police, during which time they bathed in park bathrooms and urinated in a bucket they carried in the vehicle. Deputies reported that the children ate about once a day, their meals consisting mostly of salad and bread, and hadn’t seen a doctor in years, according to the Palm Beach Post. None of the children were enrolled in school, and instead were home-schooled inside the car, Barron told police. At times, Barron gave contradictory statements to deputies. First, he told them that he attended “three years of law school and practices law, but not as a lawyer,” according to a police report reviewed by WPTV. Later, he said he lost his money trading stocks and had never attended law school. He described himself as a Native American with a “corporate name” and said he was “not the property of the U.S. or any corporation,” the Palm Beach Post reported. Police told local media that Barron and Hart appeared to be clean and in good health at the time of their arrest. Richard Hart and Robin Johnson, identified by WPTV as Hart’s parents and the grandparents of the five children, told the station they had fallen out of touch with their daughter and didn’t know how the family ended up in such a state. They said she was once a homecoming queen and attended college on an academic scholarship. “Here I am sleeping in a comfortable bed and my babies had to be sleeping in a car all crammed up like that,” Richard Hart said. “She was a very loving parent. She was a very doting parent. She took care of her children. How we get to this point, that’s a question we can’t answer.” The Palm Beach Post reported that the couple ran a blog called “Holistically Beautiful” that they launched in 2014. The blog’s “about” page says Donell and Rikki Barron created the site “to show the benefits of living a healthier lifestyle and discuss topics which can enrich one’s life.” “They believe in the importance of living a balanced life and the importance of constantly improving oneself,” it says. A call to the number listed on the site went to a disconnected line and an email to the blog wasn’t immediately returned.

He and his fiancee searched at five stores to find a matching pair in their sizes. His determination paid off in a green sweater with a giant gingerbread man applique and candy-canestriped sleeves. “I’m wearing the only one that would fit me,” the 29-yearold from St. Paul, Minn., says. “We went to … Target, Wal-Mart and two Goodwills and all were nearly sold out. The guy at T.J. Maxx said if we could wait 90 minutes they were expecting a truck.” When the ugly sweater trend started, arguably about 15 years ago, hipsters were wearing over-the-top cardigans, mostly women’s, from the ’70s, ’80s and ’90s. Their popularity spread among thrift shops, surplus stores and vintage apparel shops. Now mainstream retailers have spotted an opportunity, as what once seemed like a fad refuses to fade. Their sweaters are newly made, not from the depths of someone’s closet, but the festive holiday styling is the same. “This could be a perennial favorite for years and years to come,” says Mary Van Note of Ginger retail consulting in Minneapolis. “It has incredible widespread adoption from kids, teens and suburban moms.” Wal-Mart has sold the ugly sweaters for three years, increasing its selection of holiday and novelty items by 40 percent this year. “Customers just can’t get enough of it, and the tackier the better,” says Deanah Baker, an apparel buying executive at Wal-Mart. There are online options as well. UglyChristmasSweater.com went from $40,000 in sales in its first year, 2012, to more than $5 million last year. James Perovich of Roseville, Minn., joined the ugly sweater club six years ago. At a singles party recently where everyone was encouraged to wear an ugly Christmas sweater, he wore his vintage red pullover that features black and plaid Scottish terriers high-stepping across his chest. Bright green pants from a Polo outlet store completed his impossible-to-ignore display. “My sweater is legit vintage,” he says. “Now they’re mass-producing them.” As mass merchandisers have stepped in with new, not used, sweaters to meet demand, they’ve also expanded the category. Novelty Christmas ball earrings, flashing brooches, green-and-red-striped socks, light-up Christmas tree hats, and Sexy Miss Santa gloves augment the sweater selection. But even the ubiquitous sweaters and slightly more sedate vests for men have evolved. This year, mass merchants are selling sweatshirts in large sizes to market to men who didn’t want to buy or couldn’t fit into the vintage sweaters that are mostly in women’s sizes. “Happy Llamakah” and “Meowy Catmus” sweatshirts provide an alternative to sweaters festooned in beads, bells and balls. Department stores added cheeky onesies, pajamas, Santa suits, hoodies and men’s suits in gaudy holiday themes. For the early adopter looking to make an indelible Christmas memory, the Oppo “Rudolph” covers the wearer from neck to ankle in a bright blue and red polyester suit imprinted with reindeer and snowflakes as big as cheese balls. Eddie Ocampo of Anoka, Minn., bought one last year at Opposuits.com. He wore it to a Christmas party for students at the University of St. Thomas School of Law last month. “It’s the fourth time I’ve worn it,” says the second-year law student. “I get reactions from open-mouthed stares to strangers who say, ‘Great suit.’” The kitschy Claus-wear is a cheap, convenient way to show holiday spirit. Most used sweaters cost less than $25 and even the new Oppo suits are less than $100. But more expensive sweaters have recently debuted from sources as varied as Whoopi Goldberg, Iron Maiden and the National Football League. Goldberg’s creations for $139 at Lordandtaylor.com include a brown Santa and an octopus with a candle in each of its eight arms. NFLshop.com created an ugly sweater, at $70, for each of the 32 teams in the league. Iron Maiden’s antidote for excessive holiday sentiment includes acrylic knitted images of skulls and barbed wire, for $85.

Black Lives Matter.” after complaints from the Fraternal Order of Police. CNN reports the national FOP wrote to Walmart on Tuesday and asked the retailer to pull the shirts. The items were available on Walmart’s website via third-party merchant Old Glory. “Like other online retailers, we have a marketplace with millions of items offered by third parties that includes Blue Lives Matter, Black Lives Matter and All Lives Matter merchandise,” said a Walmart spokesman, according to CNN. “After hearing concerns from customers, we are removing the specific item with the ‘bulletproof’ reference.” James Pasco, executive director of the FOP, said the police union does not object to the phrase “Black Lives Matter” itself. “The bulletproof thing goes to the new assertiveness of some violence prone individuals to take action directly against police. We find it offensive for that reason,” said Pasco. Old Glory owner Glenn Morelli said he took the shirt down from his site, as well. “We don’t like to offend anybody,” he said.

The non-violent movement with a simple message has been countered by rival slogans such as “All Lives Matter” and the pro-police “Blue Lives Matter.” The Fraternal Order of Police (FOP) is the country’s largest police union and they have taken their hatred of the phrase to a new level. The mega-retail giant Walmart was selling hooded sweatshirts and t-shirts with the words “Bulletproof. Black Lives Matter” online. In an article published on the alt-right website Breitbart, it was noted that Walmart stopped selling Confederate flags but it sells “Black Lives Matter” merchandise. The asinine commentary comparing the BLM movement to the traitorous, rebellious, violent and racist legacy of the Confederacy was ludicrous. However, it caused national FOP President Chuck Canterbury to send a letter to Walmart CEO Douglas McMillon. The letter states, “I urge you to prohibit the use of the Walmart name and website for the retail sale of these products,” calling the merchandise offensive. The BLM merchandise is provided by the clothing company Old Glory, which is a third party supplier that also makes “Blues Lives Matter” merchandise. Canterbury goes on to state in the letter, “I am concerned that allowing these articles to be sold in this way will damage your company’s good name amongst FOP members and other active and retired law enforcement officers.” Canterbury added, “Commercializing our differences will not help our local police and communities to build greater trust and respect for one another.” Apparently, Walmart caved and issued the following statement “Like other online retailers, we have a marketplace with millions of items offered by third parties that includes Blue Lives Matter, Black Lives Matter and All Lives Matter merchandise. After hearing concerns from customers, we are removing the specific item with the ‘bulletproof’ reference.” Jim Pasco, the executive director of the police union in Washington, is quoted as stating that the merchandise issue was raised by union members who felt Walmart was selling anti-police items. “There are a lot of people who feel too many guns are sold” Pasco said. “Why not speak out against things that might be seen as fomenting violence, rather than things that commit violence?” The Black Lives Matter movement has not called for violence at any of its rallies. It is a lie that continues to be spread by those who wish to silence the voice of protest from the Black community.

They waited until Black people spent their money for the holidays with them – then they found a conscious. What will be the response Black people? Will you arrive early to Walmart for their after Xmas sale? Stop financing your own oppression. You don’t need all that shit you buy anyway.

Why not use some of that Walmart money to buy that empty house on your block that you could easily rent out? Whiteguy Being a drug dealer should not be considered self employed.

Markets Rex Tillerson’s $180 million severance package By Jonathan Berr MoneyWatch December 22, 2016, 5:30 AM Retailers go into 2017 with too many stores Comment Share Tweet Stumble Email Last Updated Dec 22, 2016 8:09 AM EST U.S. retailers have a problem they can’t easily resolve: They have too many stores. And even though they’ve already announced slews of store closings, it’s increasingly likely they’ll have to shutter even more over the next few years. That’s especially the case as consumers keep shifting their spending online, which has left the U.S. awash in unwanted retail space, or “overstored.” According to real estate information firm CoStar, nearly 1 billion square foot of retail space will be “rationalized” in the coming years through store closures and conversions to other uses. Many retailers also are seeking rent reductions as their productivity has slumped from an industry average of $330 in sales per square foot from $350 per square foot a decade ago. The level of “overstoring” may only get worse. Retail analyst Jan Rogers Kniffen expects about half of all retail sales to be online by 2030, a huge increase from current figure of about 10 percent. “A lot of these retailers are still in denial,” said Brian Yarbrough, a retail analyst at Edward Jones. “I think the Kohl’s (KSS), the J.C. Penneys (JCP) of the world, they’re in denial. At some point, there’s probably not a need for 2,400 Kohl’s and J.C. Penney’s across the United States. There’s probably not a need for 5,800 Walmart (WMT) Supercenters.” Play Video CBSN Amazon opens store without checkout line Amazon is opening a new brick-and-mortar store, but without a checkout line. CBSN's Elaine Quijano has more on the new smart grocery store. Officials from J.C. Penney didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment for this story. A Kohl’s spokesperson declined to comment beyond pointing to executive statements on earnings conference calls about “the importance of stores.” Walmart spokesman Randy Hargrove said the company doesn’t comment on analyst reports, but he noted that in October Walmart U.S. CEO Greg Foran said “next year you will see us put more capital allocation towards remodels versus new stores.” Hargrove added: “We still see a need for supercenters.” Another major chain facing significant overstored conditions is Sears Holdings (SHLD). The struggling retailer has been closing stores and unloading assets for years to bolster its finances. Here’s a closer look at how these chains are dealing with store closings. Macy’s (M) -- The country’s largest department store chain announced plans in August to shutter 100 underperforming locations in 2017, about 15 percent of its brick-and-mortar footprint. Macy’s shed 41 locations last year and axed thousands of employees. Terry Lundgren, who had led the retailer for more than a decade, will step down next year from the CEO spot and become executive chairman. Kohl’s -- After a rocky start to 2016 when it announced 18 store closures, the Wisconsin-based no-frills retailer rebounded and reported better-than-expected results in its most recent quarter. Kohl’s, though, continues to struggle. Comparable-store sales in its latest period fell 1.7 percent, the third straight decline in this closely watched retail metric of sales at stores open a year or more, a worrisome sign for Wall Street. J.C. Penney -- CEO Marvin Ellison made headlines in March that when he told Fortune he wouldn’t undertake “any wholesale closings of stores in its 1,020-location fleet,” though it did shutter seven locations. The Plano, Texas-based retailer operates almost as many stores as it did in 2006, but its annual sales were roughly $7 billion higher back then than they were last year. Ellison told the magazine that Penney’s future lies in e-commerce and physical stores working together. Walmart -- With cost pressures in mind, Walmart said in January that it would close 269 stores around the world, including its small-format Express locations that were designed to compete against the dollar stores that have taken market share from the giant in recent years. Rising expenses are weighing on the world’s largest retailer, which raised the salaries of thousands of hourly employees last year and unveiled a plan to spend billions on expanding its e-commerce operations Sears Holdings -- The Hoffman Estates, Illinois-based company has been floundering for years under the control of hedge fund tycoon Edward Lampert, who arranged the merger of Sears and Kmart that created the current company more than a decade ago.  This year it announced the shutdown of 68 Kmart stores and 10 Sears locations and accelerated the closing of 50 locations at the beginning of the year. Sears has indicated that more stores may be shuttered. “I am hard-pressed to imagine a scenario where Sears as constituted as anything we have known it will be around in 2018,” said Jason Ankeny, editor of Retail Dive, a trade news site. He added that the Sears and Kmart brands “don’t have any relevance and value for millennial consumers.” A Sears spokesman told CBS MoneyWatch critics underestimate the company. Said spokesman Howard Reifs: “We believe that we have sufficient resources to fund our transformation and meet all of our financial obligations.” The issue for all the big retail chains, however, remains a tough one: Just how many stores will they really need as shoppers increasingly put things into their shopping carts -- digitally. © 2016 CBS Interactive Inc..

His latest book is a satirical novel about university corporatization and rebellion, What’s Going On at UAardvark? Cato the Elder, a Roman senator and historian, once remarked: “Cessation of work is not accompanied by cessation of expenses.” For many centuries, retirees have been aware of this unfortunate fact, which led them to demand and, in many cases, secure old age pensions to help provide financial security during their “golden years.” But as indicated in a recently-released report by the Institute for Policy Studies (IPS), the financial security of retiring corporate CEOs is far, far greater than the financial security of average Americans. According to the extensively-researched IPS report, A Tale of Two Retirements, 100 corporate CEOs possess company retirement funds totaling $4.7 billion―an amount equivalent to the entire retirement savings of 41 percent of U.S. families (50 million families, including 116 million Americans). The retirement funds of these 100 CEOs are also equivalent to those of 75 percent of Latino families, of 59 percent of African-American families, of 55 percent of female-headed households, and of 44 percent of white working class households. Indeed, the top 100 CEO nest eggs, if averaged, would generate a $253,088 monthly retirement check to these 100 individuals for the rest of their lives. By contrast, workers who had 401(k) pension plans at the end of 2013 had only enough in these plans to pay them an average monthly benefit of $101. Of course, these were the lucky ones. Among workers 56 to 61 years old, 39 percent had no employer-sponsored retirement plan at all, and would likely depend on Social Security, which pays an average of $1,239 per month, for retirement security. Of course, these are only averages. When one looks at individuals, the contrasts are even starker. Glenn Renwick, the Progressive Insurance Company’s CEO who retired in 2016, receives a monthly retirement check from his company for $1,035,733. Among Walmart’s 1.5 million employees, fewer than two-thirds have a company-sponsored retirement plan and, if they do, it will pay them only $131 per month. But Walmart’s CEO, Doug McMillon can expect to receive at least $360,000 per month―more than 2,700 times the amount a typical Walmart worker with a 401(k) account can expect. And there’s also CEO David Cote of Honeywell―a company that has locked out its workers from its factories in Green Island, NY and South Bend Indiana for seven months for rejecting a contract that eliminated workers’ pensions―who receives a monthly retirement check from the company for $908,712. Or take the case of John Hammergreen, CEO of the McKesson corporation, a drug wholesaling giant. A few months after Hammergreen arrived at McKesson in 1996, the company froze its employee pension fund, closing it to workers who came there in 1997. Even so, the company launched a lavish Executive Benefit Retirement Account that enriched Hammergreen’s pension with an average of $22,000 a day for the next 20 years. Thus, today he receives a monthly retirement check from the company for $782,339. Things were not always like this. From 1946 to 1980, a combination of union action and government policy led to the expansion of pension benefits for American workers. By 1980, 46 percent of private sector workers were covered by defined benefit pensions. But, in the following decades, declining union strength, corporate attacks on pension funds, and government action resulted in a severe erosion of worker retirement security. By 2011, only 18 percent of private sector workers were covered by defined benefit plans. As demonstrated by the authors of the IPS report, the growth of economic inequality in retirement provisions resulted from rigging things in favor of CEOS through new rules for pensions, taxes, and executive compensation. “Since more than half of compensation is now tied to the company’s stock price,” the authors note, “CEOs have a powerful personal incentive for slashing worker retirement benefits in order to boost the short-term bottom line. Every dollar not spent on employee retiree security is money in the CEO’s pocket.” Although changes in public policy could close the widening pension gap, such changes do not seem likely to occur while a zealously pro-corporate party controls the White House, Congress, and the courts. Indeed, as the authors point out, thanks to the shielding of enormous CEO income in tax-deferred accounts, Fortune 500 CEOs will see very substantial gains in their retirement checks if President Trump succeeds in implementing his plan to slash the top marginal income tax rate. It’s possible that, in the long run, the rising tide of retirement insecurity will spark a revolt challenging the severe economic inequality between corporate CEOs and their American workers. Until then, however, it’s tempting to propose updating Jonathan Swift’s eighteenth century satirical suggestion, made in A Modest Proposal, that poverty among the poor might be alleviated by selling their babies as food for the rich. Perhaps, in twenty-first century America, retirement insecurity might be alleviated by selling elderly workers to the corporate rich, who could use them for the burgers sold by their fast food companies.

The Fraternal Order of Police wrote to Walmart CEO Doug McMillon on Tuesday, complaining that the store should not aim to profit off racial tensions in the US. 'Commercializing our differences will not help our local police and communities to build greater trust and respect for one another Turning a buck on strained relationships will not contribute to the healing process,' said the national FOP's president, Chuck Canterbury. Walmart has pulled all its 'Bulletproof: Black Lives Matter' shirts after police deemed them 'offensive' 'This should be a time for joy, and no family who has lost a son or daughter, whether in the line of duty or in a tragic event, should have their pain turned into someone else's profit.' In response to the letter, Walmart issued a statement on Tuesday saying that it would pull all its merchandise which made reference to 'bulletproof' and 'Black Lives Matter' on the same shirt.

Each item is black with red lettering across it which states: 'Black Lives Matter. Bulletproof.' The line has since been removed from the Walmart website.  The line, which was provided by third party supplier Old Glory, included hoodies, tank tops and t-shirts, which range from $16.95 to $36.95 for the sweatshirt Walmart issued a statement on Tuesday saying that it would pull all its merchandise which made reference to 'bulletproof' and 'Black Lives Matter' on the same shirt Walmart will continue to sell clothes with slogans such as Blue Lives Matter, Black Lives Matter and All Lives Matter.  Chris Kappelman, the head buyer for supplier Old Glory, told the Washington Post that Walmart had not informed him before removing the clothing line. But out of respect for their customers, they had removed the 'Bulletproof' shirts from other third-party sites as well. 'We understand where the FOP stand and their point of view,' Morelli said. 'We didn't want to ruffle any feathers. Also, too, we support the police in different ways.' The Black Lives Matter movement, which began after the death of Trayvon Martin in 2012, and has gathered pace with a slew of other police shootings of black men in subsequent years. The Fraternal Order of Police wrote to Walmart CEO Doug McMillon complaining that the megastore should not aim to profit off racial tensions in the US The movement, which has sparked protests across the country, states on its website that is an 'ideological and political intervention in a world where Black lives are systematically and intentionally targeted for demise.' However, some in law enforcement see the protest movement as anti-police and a pro-cop Blue Lives Matter movement has begun in response.  FOP Executive Director Jim Pasco said that while his organization doesn't oppose the 'Black Lives Matter' movement, or that slogan being printed on t-shirts, he was against the inflammatory use of 'bulletproof' alongside it - a direct reference to the police shootings. The FOP also wrote to Amazon Chairman and CEO Jeff Bezos to ask him to pull a similar clothing line although Amazon have not yet responded.  Share or comment on this article e-mail 40 shares Most watched News videos Dan Bilzerian show off glitzy lifestyle as 'King of Instagram' Cyclist forced off the road by dangerous braking driver Blind man attaches GoPro to guide dog to record his commute Heartbreaking moment horse cries at owner's funeral 'I thought he was going to hit me': Ann Widdecombe on Philpott Great White shark breaches the water in pursuit of a tasty treat "UFO" has been filmed demonstrating highly unusual behaviour Stepdaughter surprises stepmom with adoption papers at Christmas Meryl Streep arrives at Debbie Reynolds' and Carrie Fisher's memorial Dangling kid rescued from a ski lift at Whistler Mountain Police Video Shows Rescue Of Kidnapped Man Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds are buried together Pictured: The Fort Lauderdale 'air rage' gunman who 'argued...

The startling dash-cam video showed 45-year-old Jonathan Joseph Czech swerving all over the highway last July as police tried to pull the drunken semi-truck driver over. Minnesota State Patrol troopers say they were alerted to a semi-truck that was swerving over the lanes of Highway 10. The semi swerved off the road and onto the right shoulder at one point, when the driver hit a sign and swerved back onto the highway before eventually coming to a stop on the right shoulder, Fox 9 reports. Once the officer was able to pull the drunk semi-truck driver over, the overly inebriated driver tried to step out of the truck and fell into the highway. Czech was unable to stand even with assistance. The drunk driver rolled and crawled on the ground, forcing the trooper to redirect traffic around him as he was too intoxicated to get up and move out of the way of oncoming vehicles. The state patrol was forced to shut down one lane of the highway while they worked to get the drunk driver back on his feet and off the road to safety. Czech, who lives in Isle, Minnesota, told the trooper that he was traveling from Minot, North Dakota. The trooper reported that Czech’s speech was slurred, his eyes were bloodshot and watery, and he smelled of alcohol. The drunk semi driver told the trooper that he had consumed a “few beers.” EXCLUSIVE:Jonathan Czech had a great fall. Blew a .28 breath test once he rolled out of@Walmart semi he drove. More on his illegal load @ 9. pic.twitter.com/g7nmW07o8u — Iris Pérez (@IrisPerezFOX9) December 21, 2016 An inventory of the Walmart truck revealed two bottles of vodka next to the driver’s seat, one of which had been partially consumed. Czech’s blood alcohol level measured 0.28 on a breathalyzer test two hours later, more than three times the legal limit of 0.08 percent. The drunk semi driver was charged with two counts of driving while intoxicated and was convicted of third-degree DWI this week. This is the second drunk driving violation on his record. Minnesota drunk driving laws say that people convicted of a second offense face up to a year in jail and fines of up to $3,000. Drivers convicted of drunk driving also have their licenses revoked for 180 days. While Czech was driving a Walmart semi-truck, he is not employed by Walmart. The driver was working for third-party transportation company Crete Carrier Corporation. The company reports that Czech was fired after the drunk driving arrest. Over-the-road truck drivers for Walmart travel approximately 700 million miles each year, delivering merchandise to Walmart and Sam’s Clubs, Walmart says. The company maintains that their drivers manage “one of the largest and safest private fleets in the world.” A first-year Walmart truck driver earns an average of $82,000, they say, and drives an average 300-mile length of hauls with a regular work schedule. The company further says they will not hire drivers who have had convictions for a DUI, DWI, OUI, or reckless driving involving alcohol or drugs within the last 10 years, though it is unknown if that applies to contract drivers as well. Walmart also reports that Sam Walton said 25 years ago that “Walmart drivers are the safest drivers on the road. It’s a culture that helps us deliver Every Day Low Prices to customers.” Walmart says this is still true today.

The Lehigh Township Planning Commission met Dec. 12 to discuss the Walmart planned for Route 145. It abuts the Hills of Greenock and most of the people attending were from that development. Engineer John Hornick said sidewalks have been added along Birch Road. There has been talk with township engineer Phil Malitsch about uncontained runoff and energy dissipaters to cut down on flows. More detention ponds and bigger on-site facilities are planned. The building has been given a different shape, and new sound studies are being done. “Walmart has a rigorous audit before application to the Conservation District,” Hornick said. Planning Chairman David Shulman said the public will have questions they want answered. He said he believed left and right turn lanes should be included. If in the future the remaining land is developed, traffic will need to be able to go onto Birch Drive. Malitsch said by township ordinance, if traffic reaches a certain volume it has to be designed to Pennsylvania Department of Transportation standards. John Wichner, traffic planner, said they actually counted cars and made projections into the future. There were three counts made: rush hour at 7-9 a.m. and 4-6 p.m. and Saturday at midday. There were counts taken at nine intersections with the major one at Birch and Route 145. By PennDOT estimates there would be 700 vehicles in a 24-hour period. The intersection at Washington Street would be realigned. There will be a gas station with five pumps for 10 fueling stations. That will create cross traffic, which will be treated like a convenience store. Vegetation will be removed to increase sight distance. Planner Cindy Miller said she would rather have bus stops in the development instead of along a road, but Malitsch said it would be a liability issue to have them stop on development property. Shulman asked about the largest truck that would come in. It would be a WE57 semi. No doubles would come in. The truck lanes will be 25 feet wide with parking along the sides. Shulman wants to see more detail of the area. There will be a pickup area in the back where trucks are parked. Malitsch said that would be a drive-thru, not a parking space. None of the land will be mortgaged as of Dec. 31. A concern was that an unpaid mortgage would mean the store would not happen or continue. Resident Martin Baksembaum asked about the increase in runoff or how it will affect the rural aspects of the community. On the second issue Shulman said it is a permitted use at that location. To maintain the rural aspect it would have to be in the new comprehensive plan and Baksembaum said what he is seeing is similar to the present plan. The plan could be changed in the future by changing zoning, Shulman said. He asked about the possibility of failure because the supermarket in Walnutport did. That would be a business decision, not a planner’s concern. Wiehner said there would possibly be 280 extra cars and a dozen trucks per day. Resident Al Bodzin asked when they hoped to break ground. Delaney said it all depends on clearing the permitting. Shulman said it would probably be 2019 until they are finished with the number of variables. Resident Jim Albert asked how many bays there would be for tractor-trailers and what about non-Walmart trucks such as Coca-Cola and trucks used for overstock. Hornick said that information depends on the sound studies. Resident Mike Gabovitz asked about the sound wall between Walmart and the Hills of Greenock. Shulman said it was on an earlier plan. Hornick said there is sewage capacity at the Walnutport Authority. Resident Lorraine Wessner asked about lighting at the intersections. Shulman said it should be considered at both intersections. In other business: Weiner’s Auto Services, 4811 Lehigh Drive, may affect stormwater, Malitsch said, and the land use is a concern. The 120-foot building will have four bays with 60 percent used for storage. Weiner wants to keep the rural aspect. He expects 15 cars a day and said he does mostly motor work. He said he was just giving a little history and did not expect an answer that day. The person he brought the property from was present and said though it was used for warehousing it had been previously used for auto repair and was permitted.

Sheriff’s Office Shop With a Cop 0 By CBN on December 22, 2016 E-Headlines Shop with a Cop is a joint venture between local law enforcement agencies throughout Deschutes County, local Walmart stores and McDonalds. Its primary focus is to help make the holidays a little brighter for less-fortunate families, and provide an opportunity for children to engage in positive police interaction. Shop with a Cop completed its 16th year collecting items and assisting children and families throughout the year with basic needs during emergencies. “I am proud to say this program has stayed true to the ideals since founded in 2000: To provide less fortunate students with a one-on-one experience with uniformed law enforcement while shopping for holiday presents for themselves and family members. In addition, this program assists children and families throughout the year with basic needs during emergencies,” stated Sheriff L. Shane Nelson. This program helps to establish positive law enforcement interaction with the children and their families. “Each year the children surprise us. We see many shoppers pass by the toy aisle and go directly to the clothing section of Walmart. They say they need warm clothes and shoes for themselves and their siblings. However, nothing can prepare a deputy for the realization of what he or she may encounter when escorting their student shopper home. Last year, one deputy was puzzled by his student’s shopping list containing mostly disposable items and blankets. When the deputy took the boy “home” he came to realize the depth of this child’s need. The boy and his family lived in the Bend Walmart parking lot in their car. With temperatures below freezing, this 10 year old boy said he and his family struggle to stay warm at night.” This year the team shopped with over 123 students. Their shopping lists included 558 family members. The compassion and generosity of our citizen’s really do make a difference in the lives of children in Deschutes County. 100 Percent of the donations are applied to the local program. This year the students shopped on December 13th at the Redmond Walmart store and on December 14 and 15 at the Bend Walmart store. “We thank all the citizens who donated to this cherished annual event and the members of the Deschutes County Sheriff’s Office, Bend Police Department, Redmond Police Department, Sunriver Police Department, Black Butte Police Department, U.S. Forest Service-Law Enforcement Division, Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office, Oregon State Police, Prineville Police Department, Bureau of Land Management-Law Enforcement Divison and Crook County Sheriff’s Office who took the children shopping and delivered them and their presents to their home.” SheriffPIO@deschutes.org Share.

With the holiday shopping season creeping earlier in the calendar and Black Friday deals starting to show up weeks before Thanksgiving, retailers are offering deeper cuts in their after-Christmas sales in the hope of breaking through the retail fatigue. The week after Christmas offers the last chance to draw in customers before they settle into winter hibernation, so stores will go the extra mile to make it worth their while. The retail website TheBlackFriday.com has compiled a list of all the after Christmas sales, showing that deals on flat-screen televisions and video game bundles remain just as popular after the holiday as they were before. Some of the top after Christmas deals include the following items. Walmart: Vizio 55-inch HDTV for $378 Target: Xbox One (with controller and digital download of Minecraft) for $249.99 Best Buy: LG 55-inch HDTV for $399.99 But major retailers aren’t the only ones trying to draw in shoppers for their after Christmas 2016 sales. Many smaller chains and local outlets are also slashing prices to clear the shelves of excess holiday gifts and seasonal items, so picking up the local newspaper on or after Christmas (or checking directly on their websites) can reveal even more savings. After Christmas sale. Use coupon code SHOPSMALL10 at Frugal Fortune in our online Etsy shop to… https://t.co/3oDZwWCh2R #couponcode #Deals — Frugal Fortune (@frugalfortune) December 22, 2016 The after-Christmas 2016 sales are mostly aimed at enticing shoppers to spend the gift cards they got over the holiday, retail experts noted. “Years ago, before online shopping became a big deal, the week after Christmas used to be all about returns,” Jim Easley, general manager of the Staten Island Mall, told SILive.com. “Now that week has become when everyone comes to the mall and spends those gift cards that they got over the holidays.” For shoppers looking to hit up the after-Christmas 2016 sales, experts offer a bit of advice on what to buy and what to avoid. Melissa Martin of BlackFriday.com told SILive.com that clothing will be available at a great discount, as retailers are eager to empty their stock before the clothes are out of style. Toys that didn’t sell as well during the holiday season will also have prices clashed, and holiday decorations can be found at anywhere up to a 90 percent discount — depending on how long shoppers are able to wait to buy it. And DealNews.com noted that shoppers looking for cameras can find some great deals in the after Christmas 2016 sales. “One category of electronics stands out as a hot post-holiday buy: cameras. During after-Christmas sales last year, 37% of camera deals were Editors’ Choice. Canon offered some of the hottest deals we’ve seen on both refurbs and new models in late January. We saw refurb lenses starting as low as $49.99 and up to $700 off new cameras.” But other purchases may not be so wise during the after Christmas sales. The National Retail Federation noted that television prices will actually be lower in the week before the Super Bowl and that luxury brands often end their deals before Christmas arrives. 10 Things That Go On Sale After Christmas https://t.co/teQKtee2qz on @bloglovin — TOTS Family (@totsfamily) December 20, 2016 “The great buys are on the after-Christmas wear, the coats, the hats and boots will be marked down considerably,” Melissa Martin told SILive.com last year. “But stay away from those luxury coat brands, like North Face, because those [prices] usually don’t go down regardless.” But those looking to hit up the after Christmas sales should keep time on their side. Many of the deals will last only as long as the stores have sale items in stock, so the earlier they can get out to do their shopping, the better.

(Photo: Saul Loeb, AFP/Getty Images) From the depths of grandma's closet to the shelves of major retailers, the deliberately “ugly Christmas sweater” is turning into big business. Whether it's a sweater depicting a knit Darth Vader wearing a neck scarf or a cheery "Chillin' with my Snowmies" pullover, the more outrageous, the better. Major chains like Target, Sears and Walmart report they have been offering wider assortments every year. “Since Halloween, customer interest in ugly Christmas sweaters has exploded,"  Walmart spokeswoman Meggan Kring, adding that searches on Walmart's site peaked in the second week in November. Now, she says many items are sold out, though they’re replacing inventory with other ugly sweater options. Sears says it's sold out of some of its worst -- or best, depending on how you look at it -- holiday sweaters. Target offered a two-person sweater this year, and one of their top selling items was an ugly sweater dress that looks a little like “Mrs. Claus’ gingerbread dress,” according to spokeswoman Jessica Carlson. “Hanukkah themed sweaters have also been popular over the past couple years. So it’s not just Christmas -- it's across all of the holiday celebrations,” she said. Sears spokesman Mitchell Lee said consumers want the most garish sweater items available for their “Ugly Christmas Sweater” parties or picture days at work. "Success comes from how fun the sweaters can be and whose is the most outrageous…or, I suppose, “ugliest.'" Lee says. Shortages of of the worst is leaving some holiday celebrants scrambling. On Twitter, many shared stories of their fruitless searches for the perfect ugly Christmas sweaters. “I looked all over for an ugly Christmas sweater today, and every place was sold out,” tweeted @RickyyLopezz this week. USA TODAY Don't forget to pick up your ugly Chrismukkah sweater as tchotchkes abound I looked all over for an ugly Christmas sweater today and every place was sold out 😔— RICKY (@RickyyLopezz_) December 21, 2016 Couldn't find a nice ugly Christmas sweater 😭they all sold out— Roberto Reyes (@RReyes46) December 17, 2016 For decades, ugly Christmas sweaters were considered white elephants foisted on the unsuspecting by grandmothers or others with the best of intentions. They started taking on a life of their own a few years ago when some revelers started deliberately seeking out the over-the-top items from thrift stores or garage sales. At the time, no one would have suspected they would become such hot-ticket apparel at major retailers. USA TODAY Don't forget to pick up your ugly Chrismukkah sweater as tchotchkes abound Target has carried “ugly or festive holiday sweaters” in its inventory since 2013, according Target's Carlson. “It has certainly been a product that people have wanted and increasingly each year come back to Target to buy.” Carlson said Target had seen double-digit growth in its festive and ugly Christmas sweater merchandise compared to last year. It’s becoming increasingly clear that the ugly Christmas sweater is having its “pet rock” moment, Mark Cohen, a Columbia Business School professor, referring to a 1970s fad that has become a symbol of the ultimate useless gift. “It’s the perfect gift for someone you feel you must buy something for, but who has everything," he said. USA TODAY Hanukkah overlaps with Christmas this year. But why all the moving around? As for the sweater craze, it’s not just traditional retailers that are cashing in. Fred Hajjar, president of UglyChristmasSweater.com, said his team went from $40,000 in ugly Christmas sweater sales in 2012, to almost $5 million last year. Hajjar said he and his brother noticed the ugly Christmas sweater trend in 2011 when they saw horrendous holiday sweaters going for hundreds on eBay. “We purchased the domain name UglyChristmasSweater.com, and in 2012 launched the site and sold tons of sweaters,” he said. “That year it was more grandma-type sweaters, but it’s now transitioned to a mixture of grandma, trendy and crazy.” Hajjar said this year has been a transition year for the company as his crew has made changes to compete with big-box stores. “We had some sweaters that were more risqué, where we knew the big box retailers couldn’t carry them,” he said, describing a sweater with a stripper on a pole and elves throwing cash at the dancer. Will the ugly Christmas sweater trend persist? Cohen said the 2016 holiday season will go down in history as a crazy year when people will pay a fortune for something supremely ugly. "In 1,000 years, if the planet is still viable, ... no doubt an archaeologist doing a Ph.D thesis will try to delve into the meaning of this ugly sweater phenomenon that came from nowhere in 2016," he said.

Time A group of people wear Black Lives Matter t-shirts. (Photo: Jack Gruber, USA TODAY) Walmart stopped selling shirts featuring the word "bulletproof" on Black Lives Matter merchandise after the world's largest police organization called the slogan offensive. Walmart said Tuesday it removed the specific item after the Fraternal Order of Police (FOP) asked them to in a letter. "Like other online retailers, we have a marketplace with millions of items offered by third parties that includes Blue Lives Matter, Black Lives Matter and All Lives Matter merchandise," said a Walmart representative. "After hearing concerns from customers, we removed the specific item with the 'bulletproof' reference." Walmart pulls 'Bulletproof,' 'Black Lives Matter' shirt after FOP request https://t.co/JQbRCs6T8npic.twitter.com/rSv1gRFMIr— PoliceOne.com (@PoliceOne) December 21, 2016 FOP National President Chuck Canterbury, in a letter sent Tuesday to Walmart President and CEO C. Douglas McMillon, called the shirts offensive and said he was concerned Walmart's decision to sell them would "damage your company's good name amongst FOP members and active and retired law enforcement officers." Canterbury also chided third-party sellers for what he called an attempt to profit off racial division. "Commercializing our differences will not help our local police and communities to build greater trust and respect for one another," the letter said. "Turning a buck on strained relationships will not contribute to the healing process." The "bulletproof" shirt did not appear on Walmart's website Thursday morning, but dozens of other "Black Lives Matter" shirts were listed. The Black Lives Matter organization, which describes itself as trying to rebuild the black liberation movement, has risen to prominence for activism in light of police shootings involving African Americans. Glenn Morelli, the owner of Old Glory Merchandise, the shirt's maker, said he's not surprised by the FOP's request. He got a call from the organization last week and decided he'd pull the shirt himself. He said the shirt now isn't featured on any of the websites selling Old Glory merchandise. "We understand where the FOP stand and their point of view," Morelli said. "We didn't want to ruffle any feathers. Also, too, we support the police in different ways." FOP Executive Director Jim Pasco said his organization doesn't oppose the "Black Lives Matter" phrase, but does object to those who intend to divide Americans racially. The organization, he said, decided to take action after the shirt was flagged by members. The FOP also posted a similar letter addressed to Amazon Chairman and CEO Jeff Bezos. The letter, dated Wednesday, raised concerns over the slogans "bulletproof," "Black Lives Matter" and "Hands Up, Don't Shoot." It urges Amazon to stop selling the items. "Because I believe you share the FOP's goal of increasing the bonds of trust between the men and women of law enforcement, I wanted to let you know that my members are very upset that you and Amazon are complicit in the sale of this offensive merchandise," Canterbury wrote. A version of the "bulletproof" t-shirts are still available on Amazon, who did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Photo / Supplied Five malnourished children have been found living in car at Walmart with healthy parents, police say. A deputy said he was on a routine patrol in Greenacres, Florida, last weekend when he spotted a blue Toyota in a Walmart parking lot. It wasn't the look of the vehicle that caught his attention but the smell emanating from it - an odour "similar to that of homeless camps", he said. Inside was a family of seven. The parents seemed healthy, police said, but the five children, aged from 4 to 14, were filthy, fatigued and so malnourished that their bones were protruding from under their skin, according to WPTV. The oldest reportedly weighed a mere 23kg, just 2kg more than his 8-year-old sibling. The parents, Donell Barron and Rikki Hart, 34, were arrested on charges of child neglect, according to WPTV. As of Wednesday evening, they were being held in the Palm Beach County Jail in lieu of $1000 bail, the Palm Beach Post reported. The Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office told local media that the children, all of whom were described as "underweight," were taken to a hospital, where at least one was treated for unusually high blood pressure. The five kids are now in custody of the Florida Department of Children and Families, the Palm Beach Post reported. Police said they took some of the children to eat at McDonald's, where they "ravenously ate the meals, as if they had not been fed in quite some time". When interviewed by the sheriff's office, Barron gave a grim account of how the family wound up living out of their car. According to the Palm Beach Post, Barron told police that they had been evicted from their home in Port St Lucie about a year ago and had spent about 10 months hopping from one hotel to another before they ran out of money. They had lived in the car for the past two months, he told police, during which time they bathed in park bathrooms and urinated in a bucket they carried in the vehicle. Deputies reported that the children ate about once a day, their meals consisting mostly of salad and bread, and hadn't seen a doctor in years, according to the Palm Beach Post. None of the children was enrolled in school, and instead were home-schooled inside the car, Barron told police. At times, Barron gave contradictory statements to deputies. First, he told them that he attended "three years of law school and practices law, but not as a lawyer", according to a police report reviewed by WPTV. Later, he said he lost his money trading stocks and had never attended law school. He described himself as a Native American with a "corporate name" and said he was "not the property of the US or any corporation," the Palm Beach Post reported. Continued below. Related Content Cartoon: Boxing Day shopping craze Editorial: Life's still a beach 'It's just not worth the heartache': Grieving daughter's plea to drivers still using their cell phones while behind the wheel Police told local media that Barron and Hart appeared to be clean and in good health at the time of their arrest. Richard Hart and Robin Johnson, identified by WPTV as Hart's parents and the grandparents of the five children, told the station they had fallen out of touch with their daughter and didn't know how the family ended up in such a state. They said she was once a homecoming queen and attended college on an academic scholarship. "Here I am sleeping in a comfortable bed and my babies had to be sleeping in a car all crammed up like that," Richard Hart said. "She was a very loving parent. She was a very doting parent. She took care of her children. How we get to this point, that's a question we can't answer." The Palm Beach Post reported that the couple ran a blog called "Holistically Beautiful" that they launched in 2014. The blog's "about" page says Donell and Rikki Barron created the site "to show the benefits of living a healthier lifestyle and discuss topics which can enrich one's life." "They believe in the importance of living a balanced life and the importance of constantly improving oneself," it says. A call to the number listed on the site went to a disconnected line and an email to the blog wasn't immediately returned. - Washington Post Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Loading Discover more Loading Loading Herald Services Book your ad Driven Photos for sale True Commercial Death Notices Public Notices Our Regional News Stories The Northern Advocate Charges over Kerikeri ute crash The driver of a ute that crashed into three lamp posts and rolled in Northland yesterday… Hawke's Bay Today Tourists' envy at best job around Gannet Beach Adventures managing director Kim Lindsay says the company is seeing a hike… Bay of Plenty Times Book shop closure end of an era The boom in charity fundraising book sales has killed off the last book exchange on the… Our Features' Top Stories Driven Steady start for new Mustang drift car New Mustang prepped for opening D1NZ drift hit out at Manfeild...

When Arnold was first diagnosed with diabetes she needed to test her blood sugar 10 times a day. She went to Wal-Mart and found that one box, which contained only a five-day supply of test strips, was $80. Arnold called her parents and told them she didn't know what to do. She didn't have the money. Arnold then did what a lot of people do when they need help: She searched on Google. She typed in the words "cheap test strips," and Craigslist came up. She bought eight boxes for less than $100. At Wal-Mart, she would have paid $640. Arnold said, "it was like having a life sentence and then realizing that there's a cure." With this Google search, Arnold stumbled into an underground economy for diabetic supplies. It's a market that offers a lower-cost option for test strips, though it is hard for customers to know where the boxes come from. Some boxes may be repackaged and unsafe to use, and some boxes are sold by diabetics who are desperate for cash. But many of them come from people who have health insurance and have accumulated extra test strips. Article continues after sponsorship Trey falls into this category. (He asked us not to use his last name, because he fears retribution from his insurance company, even though he feels he hasn't broken any laws.) He moved from one type of blood sugar monitoring system to another type of monitoring system and ended up with 20 extra test strip boxes. At that point, Trey began researching. He said, "Obviously No. 1: Is it legal to be able to sell test strips?" Trey realized that it is legal, with a caveat. "It's kind of a gray market as long as you don't get them from Medicare and Medicaid," he said. Trey then found a local buyer on Craigslist. It starts to look a little seedy here. He put the 20 boxes in a brown paper lunch bag. "When I went to sell the test strips we met in a McDonald's parking lot," Trey said. "I came out with the bag full of test strips, and he had his wallet full of money and it was like we were doing a geriatric drug deal in the McDonald's parking lot to get rid of some test trips." Trey made $300 off the geriatric drug deal. He jokingly calls the cash he made "blood money." He used his "blood money" to buy Christmas presents for his kids. As far as we can tell, his test strips went on to the next stop: a gray market middleman, something like a wholesaler, someone like Christa Kral. Along with her cousin, Kral purchases diabetic test strips from people like Trey. Their website is called sellusdiabeticteststrips.com. To advertise, Kral used to post fliers near the train station in her town. Now her ads are online. She thinks the company's unusual tagline has also brought in customers: "Two moms will buy your test strips." Kral operates her business out of her dining room. She has a cardboard box with about 20 boxes of test strips inside. She might pay $50 a box. It depends on the brand, the condition of the box, and the expiration date for the test strips. Then she sells them at a markup to the next part of this chain: retailers. Arnold, the woman who bought test strips off Craigslist because they were too expensive at Wal-Mart, is now a retailer. That time when she couldn't afford her test strips and keep her blood sugar in check — it scared her, and it made her decide to change her career path. Arnold had been planning to go to medical school. But "that's what really made me think I shouldn't be a doctor and that I should go and help people try to afford the test strips," she said. Arnold started a website, glucomart.com. It's a place where people can buy affordable test strips. She turned her garage into a kind of pharmacy. Her floor is epoxied, and she has pharmacy shelves. Arnold realizes that if manufacturers or insurance companies lowered the price of test strips, she could be put out of business. She's actually OK with that, because, she said, "the business exists to help people afford the test strips they need." Arnold would be happy to go back to her original plan and trade in her pharmacy shelves for a doctor's coat.

He moved from one type of blood sugar monitoring system to another type of monitoring system and ended up with 20 extra test strip boxes. At that point, Trey began researching. He said, "Obviously No. 1: Is it legal to be able to sell test strips?" Trey realized that it is legal, with a caveat. "It's kind of a gray market as long as you don't get them from Medicare and Medicaid," he said. Trey then found a local buyer on Craigslist. It starts to look a little seedy here. He put the 20 boxes in a brown paper lunch bag. "When I went to sell the test strips we met in a McDonald's parking lot," Trey said. "I came out with the bag full of test strips, and he had his wallet full of money and it was like we were doing a geriatric drug deal in the McDonald's parking lot to get rid of some test trips." Trey made $300 off the geriatric drug deal. He jokingly calls the cash he made "blood money." He used his "blood money" to buy Christmas presents for his kids. As far as we can tell, his test strips went on to the next stop: a gray market middleman, something like a wholesaler, someone like Christa Kral. Along with her cousin, Kral purchases diabetic test strips from people like Trey. Their website is called sellusdiabeticteststrips.com. To advertise, Kral used to post fliers near the train station in her town. Now her ads are online. She thinks the company's unusual tagline has also brought in customers: "Two moms will buy your test strips." Kral operates her business out of her dining room. She has a cardboard box with about 20 boxes of test strips inside. She might pay $50 a box. It depends on the brand, the condition of the box, and the expiration date for the test strips. Then she sells them at a markup to the next part of this chain: retailers. Arnold, the woman who bought test strips off Craigslist because they were too expensive at Wal-Mart, is now a retailer. That time when she couldn't afford her test strips and keep her blood sugar in check — it scared her, and it made her decide to change her career path. Arnold had been planning to go to medical school. But "that's what really made me think I shouldn't be a doctor and that I should go and help people try to afford the test strips," she said. Arnold started a website, glucomart.com. It's a place where people can buy affordable test strips. She turned her garage into a kind of pharmacy. Her floor is epoxied, and she has pharmacy shelves. Arnold realizes that if manufacturers or insurance companies lowered the price of test strips, she could be put out of business. She's actually OK with that, because, she said, "the business exists to help people afford the test strips they need." Arnold would be happy to go back to her original plan and trade in her pharmacy shelves for a doctor's coat.

And, even if you aren’t of color you may have heard of high-profile women like Oprah Winfrey exposed to racial discrimination while shopping. The phrase "shopping while black” is alive and according to the members of the campaign, Making Change at Walmart (which is funded by the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union), Walmart is its most recent discriminator. Two weeks ago, members of the Making Change at Walmart campaign claimed three Walmart stores in Virginia added extra security packaging on black hair care products. Now, this week, that same group launched a television ad asking viewers to call the mayor of Suffolk, Virginia, Linda Johnson, and "tell her to demand Walmart stop." More on stories on Walmart: The Smart Way to Shop for Beauty Products at Walmart These New Makeup Brushes At Walmart Are Under $10 and Amazing This Drugstore Curling Iron Is the Secret to the Sexiest Waves Ever Though the group claims this is happening at three Walmart locations in Virginia, The Virginian-Pilot visited the three locations they cited, but found only one store had some black hair products enclosed in plastic security containers. “We are disappointed with these allegations because they are false and offensive. Like every retailer, we take steps to make sure the items that might be high on a shoplifter’s list are protected against theft,” E. Blake Jackson, director of corporate communications told Allure. “Unfortunately, the hair care items in question are heavily targeted by shoplifters in this particular store, so we are taking normal measures to protect the items against theft so they are available for the customers who need them.” Jackson couldn’t comment if the store plans to offer extra security packaging on mainstream hair products not targeted to black women or if there are plans to remove the packaging in an effort to make amends with any shoppers they may have offended. We also reached out to the Virginia stores for additional detail, but no one was available for comment at the time of going to press. This racial issue comes on the heels of Walmart agreeing to stop selling t-shirts and hooded sweatshirts online (via a third-party merchant) that read "Bulletproof. Black Lives Matter." But as for this controversy with the Virginia stores, “these measures are not a reflection of our valued customers and any attempt to insinuate otherwise by this particular group is shameful,” says Jackson.

Wal-Mart told Fox News Insider that it will no longer sell the shirts with the words "Bulletproof: Black Lives Matter" on its website. The move came after the Fraternal Order of Police called the shirts offensive and asked the retailer to stop sales. Wal-Mart responded by providing a statement Tuesday to the Associated Press pledging to cease sales of the shirts. The statement said the company has a marketplace with millions of items offered by third parties, including Blue Lives Matter, Black Lives Matter and All Lives Matter merchandise. It said Wal-Mart removed the Black Lives Matter shirt after hearing concerns from customers. The shirts were sold by Connecticut-based Old Glory Merchandise. A company representative was not immediately available for comment. TRADE U.S. threatens action in beef with Europe The Obama administration has moved closer to taking trade actions against the European Union over its ban on most American beef products. The office of the U.S. Trade Representative said Thursday that it would schedule a hearing and seek public comment that could result in tariffs imposed on food products imported from the E.U. to the United States. In the past, products subjected to that retaliatory tariff have included Italian mineral water, Roquefort cheese and truffles. American beef exports represent a $6 billion a year business, and the move could be significant for the country's largest beef-producing states, which include Kansas, Texas and California. The E.U. has banned meat produced with growth-inducing hormones since 1989. U.S. officials have long maintained there is no scientific basis for banning hormone-treated beef, and many other countries use hormones to stimulate growth in beef cattle. In 1997, the World Trade Organization ruled that the ban violated international trade rules. AVIATION Attendants say uniforms make them ill American Airlines flight attendants filed a grievance with the carrier over new uniforms, saying they have caused headaches, skin irritation and other problems since being introduced several months ago. The airline should either stop issuing the uniforms or allow workers to wear their previous outfits, Bob Ross, president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, said in a letter to American's general counsel. The union also requested that the airline, the biggest U.S.-based carrier by traffic, reimburse flight attendants for any uniform-related health care costs and set aside $2 million to fund a study of the outfits. American Airlines Group Inc. has tested the uniforms three times and will conduct a fourth test jointly with the union, spokesman Ron DeFeo said. TRANSPORTATION Airbus secures $18 billion Iran Air deal Airbus and Iran Air finalized Thursday a deal for 100 planes worth more than $18 billion dollars at list prices — a contract that is potentially a big boost for Iran's post-sanctions economy. Under the terms of the deal, which was initially announced in January, Airbus said deliveries are expected to begin early next year. The contract includes single-aisle A320 and A330 jets and widebody A350 XWB planes. As well as further modernizing Iran's aging aviation fleet, which has been hobbled by years of sanctions, the deal is a boon to Airbus too as Iran's flag carrier had finalized a deal for 80 jetliners from U.S. plane maker Boeing Co. — Airbus' key rival — earlier this month. HOUSING Long-term mortgages climb again Long-term U.S. mortgage rates climbed again this week, hitting the highest levels since 2014. Mortgage giant Freddie Mac said Thursday that the rate on 30-year fixed-rate loans jumped to an average 4.30 percent from 4.16 percent last week and the highest since April 2014. The average for a 15-year mortgage rose to 3.52 percent from 3.37 percent last week and is the highest since January 2014. Rates on adjustable five-year mortgages shot up this week to 3.32 percent from 3.19 percent last week and highest since mid-2011. Rates have surged since the Nov. 8 election of Donald Trump. Investors have bid rates higher because they believe the president-elect's plans for tax cuts and higher infrastructure spending will drive up economic growth and inflation.

When Arnold was first diagnosed with diabetes she needed to test her blood sugar 10 times a day. She went to Wal-Mart and found that one box, which contained only a five-day supply of test strips, was $80. Arnold called her parents and told them she didn't know what to do. She didn't have the money. Arnold then did what a lot of people do when they need help: She searched on Google. She typed in the words "cheap test strips," and Craigslist came up. She bought eight boxes for less than $100. At Wal-Mart, she would have paid $640. Arnold said, "it was like having a life sentence and then realizing that there's a cure." With this Google search, Arnold stumbled into an underground economy for diabetic supplies. It's a market that offers a lower-cost option for test strips, though it is hard for customers to know where the boxes come from. Some boxes may be repackaged and unsafe to use, and some boxes are sold by diabetics who are desperate for cash. But many of them come from people who have health insurance and have accumulated extra test strips. Article continues after sponsorship Trey falls into this category. (He asked us not to use his last name, because he fears retribution from his insurance company, even though he feels he hasn't broken any laws.) He moved from one type of blood sugar monitoring system to another type of monitoring system and ended up with 20 extra test strip boxes. At that point, Trey began researching. He said, "Obviously No. 1: Is it legal to be able to sell test strips?" Trey realized that it is legal, with a caveat. "It's kind of a gray market as long as you don't get them from Medicare and Medicaid," he said. Trey then found a local buyer on Craigslist. It starts to look a little seedy here. He put the 20 boxes in a brown paper lunch bag. "When I went to sell the test strips we met in a McDonald's parking lot," Trey said. "I came out with the bag full of test strips, and he had his wallet full of money and it was like we were doing a geriatric drug deal in the McDonald's parking lot to get rid of some test trips." Trey made $300 off the geriatric drug deal. He jokingly calls the cash he made "blood money." He used his "blood money" to buy Christmas presents for his kids. As far as we can tell, his test strips went on to the next stop: a gray market middleman, something like a wholesaler, someone like Christa Kral. Along with her cousin, Kral purchases diabetic test strips from people like Trey. Their website is called sellusdiabeticteststrips.com. To advertise, Kral used to post fliers near the train station in her town. Now her ads are online. She thinks the company's unusual tagline has also brought in customers: "Two moms will buy your test strips." Kral operates her business out of her dining room. She has a cardboard box with about 20 boxes of test strips inside. She might pay $50 a box. It depends on the brand, the condition of the box, and the expiration date for the test strips. Then she sells them at a markup to the next part of this chain: retailers. Arnold, the woman who bought test strips off Craigslist because they were too expensive at Wal-Mart, is now a retailer. That time when she couldn't afford her test strips and keep her blood sugar in check — it scared her, and it made her decide to change her career path. Arnold had been planning to go to medical school. But "that's what really made me think I shouldn't be a doctor and that I should go and help people try to afford the test strips," she said. Arnold started a website, glucomart.com. It's a place where people can buy affordable test strips. She turned her garage into a kind of pharmacy. Her floor is epoxied, and she has pharmacy shelves. Arnold realizes that if manufacturers or insurance companies lowered the price of test strips, she could be put out of business. She's actually OK with that, because, she said, "the business exists to help people afford the test strips they need." Arnold would be happy to go back to her original plan and trade in her pharmacy shelves for a doctor's coat.

Photo by J.B. Forbes, jforbes@post-dispatch.com Shoppers on the hunt for last-minute gifts are packing St. Louis area stores and malls, but some of them are finding ways to avoid long lines and save time. Taking advantage of a service more retailers are offering this season, customers are ordering merchandise online, then picking it up near store entrances. Tom Brooks, 50, of St. Charles, spent just a few minutes Thursday morning at the Kohl’s in Creve Coeur, gathering the items he’d ordered — and skipping the registers. “I have 95 percent of my shopping done,” he said. “I will finish today. I hope.” Since Tuesday, Kohl’s stores have been open around-the-clock — and they won’t close their doors until 6 p.m. Saturday. That’s 107 hours of uninterrupted selling this week. Amanda Zamarripa, 36, of St. Louis County, also planned to complete her shopping Thursday. “I’ve been shopping since Black Friday but I’m still not done,” she said, adding she’s further along than her husband, who hasn’t started yet. “He’s a true Christmas Eve shopper,” she said. “It’s his tradition.” Other stores are offering extended shopping hours to accommodate last-minute holiday shoppers. Most Macy’s stores are open until 11 p.m. or midnight Friday and from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Christmas Eve. Macy’s offers customers the ability to buy online and pick up in store up until noon on Christmas Eve as an added convenience, said Macy’s spokeswoman Andrea Schwartz. “We also hope you stay and buy a little more in the store,” she said. Over the last year, traditional brick-and-mortar retailers made greater investments in their online and mobile offerings to better meet consumer needs and attract spending, said Brian Field, senior director of advisory services at ShopperTrak, a Chicago-based retail analytics firm. “This holiday, a significant number of consumers shopped both online and via their mobile device, and retailers were particularly successful in capturing such sales.” Two of the busiest shopping days this year are expected to be Friday, when procrastinators get in on the act, and Monday, the day after Christmas when people make returns and spend gift cards they received, according to ShopperTrak. Wal-Mart, the nation’s largest retailer, will close its stores at 6 p.m. on Christmas Eve, two hours earlier than last year. Like most retailers, its stores will be closed on Christmas. This year, Wal-Mart offered customers the ability to order merchandise online, including toys and electronics, with a guarantee that the items will be available for pickup in stores anytime before 6 p.m. on Christmas Eve. The retailer also is putting extra effort on restocking its digital and physical aisles to ensure there’s an abundance of last-minute gifts, said Wal-Mart spokeswoman Danit Marquardt. “We know that there are still customers who have shopping to do,” Marquardt said. “We’ve moved up shipments of Barbie, Lego, Pajanimals and My Little Pony toys that typically would have come in January to arrive instead in December.” Most local malls are open extended hours Friday and Saturday to allow procrastinators a chance to complete their shopping. At Chesterfield Mall, shoppers at several stores that are permanently closing soon — the Limited, Pottery Barn and Williams Sonoma — scoured the aisles and racks Thursday for clearance markdowns. At the Limited, which is closing Wednesday, all merchandise was 70 percent off, and even the store mannequins were available for purchase. Zenova Harris and James Williams, students at Northwest Missouri State University, were finishing their holiday shopping at the St. Louis Galleria mall Thursday. The friends waited until they returned home to St. Louis to visit family to shop. “There’s no mall near our school,” Harris said, as they made a pit stop to buy a pretzel at Auntie Anne’s.

West County Mall and South County Center will be open from 8 a.m. to 11 p.m. Friday and 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. Saturday. St. Clair Square and Mid Rivers Mall open from 8 a.m. to 11 p.m. Friday and 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. Saturday. The St. Louis Galleria is open 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. Friday and 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. Saturday. Chesterfield Mall is open Friday from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. and Saturday from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. Also in Chesterfield, both St. Louis Premium Outlets and Taubman Prestige Outlets will be open Friday 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. St. Louis Premium Outlets will be open 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Saturday, and Taubman will open Saturday, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. “The final shopping week before Christmas is always a busy week,” said Liz Harry, St. Louis Premium Outlet’s director of marketing, adding many of the outlets are offering even deeper discounts than usual. For those who put off a visit to see Santa to the very last minute, there’s still time. At St. Louis Premium Outlets, Santa and Mrs. Claus will be available for photos on Christmas Eve from 1 to 3 p.m. And, shoppers who weren’t able to find one of the most popular toys this season, Hatchimals, can still find the hatching egg toys on store shelves before Christmas, said Toys R Us spokeswoman Jessica Offerjust. Toys R Us stores are opening Friday at 6 a.m. and plan to remain open for 39 hours straight until Saturday at 9 p.m. Other top-selling items this season are Power Wheels Wild Thing ride-on vehicles and the Nintendo NES Classic Edition, she said. “We knew this was going to be one of the hottest toys,” Offerjust said of the Hatchimals, which have prompted some shoppers to wait in lines for hours outside of stores before they open in a quest to find the sought-after items. “We’ll have more after the holidays.” Editor's Note: The Saint Louis Galleria will be open from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Christmas Eve. An earlier version of this story listed incorrect operating hours for the mall.  Business Briefing from St. Louis Post-Dispatch Make it your business.

A Walmart representative said, "Like other online retailers, we have a marketplace with millions of items offered by third parties that includes Blue Lives Matter, Black Lives Matter and All Lives Matter merchandise. After hearing concerns from customers, we removed the specific item with the 'bulletproof' reference." (It can be seen in the tweet below). Walmart pulls 'Bulletproof,' 'Black Lives Matter' shirt after FOP request https://t.co/JQbRCs6T8n pic.twitter.com/rSv1gRFMIr — PoliceOne.com (@PoliceOne) December 21, 2016 The letter came from Fraternal Order of Police National President Chuck Canterbury, who called the shirts “offensive” and damaging to the company name. He said the shirts would "damage your company's good name amongst FOP members and active and retired law enforcement officers." Canterbury denounced the shirts in no uncertain terms. "Commercializing our differences will not help our local police and communities to build greater trust and respect for one another," he wrote. "Turning a buck on strained relationships will not contribute to the healing process." The Bulletproof shirt was made by Old Glory Merchandise, whose owner Glenn Morelli said he was contacted by the FOP last week and pulled the shirt. "We understand where the FOP stand and their point of view. We didn't want to ruffle any feathers. Also, too, we support the police in different ways," Morelli said. That support includes the company's own Blue Lives Matter shirt. The FOP also reportedly sent a similar letter to Amazon Wednesday, complaining about people using Amazon to sell shirts like Bulletproof: Black Lives Matter and the, in the organization's words, “urban myth” of “Hands Up, Don’t Shoot.”   The Fraternal Order of Police, the largest police union, endorsed Donald Trump and has now called for the president-elect to further militarize police.

Thomas / Getty Images Walmart has reportedly pulled a line of T-shirts reading "Black Lives Matter" from its online store after receiving a complaint letter from the Fraternal Order of Police, the country's largest police organization. The letter, written by FOP president Chuck Canterbury, requested that the retail chain remove shirts that read "Bulletproof" and "Black Lives Matter," stating that the merchandise was "offensive" and encouraged "racial division." In response, Walmart pulled the "Bulletproof" shirts (which also include the phrase "Black Lives Matter" beneath that text), but not the "Black Lives Matter"-only ones, according to the Washington Post. In a statement Wednesday night, Walmart noted that the shirts were being sold via their online marketplace by a third-party retailer, Old Glory but stated, "After hearing concerns from customers, we are removing the specific item with the ‘bulletproof’ reference.” Old Glory also produces items that read "Blue Lives Matter" and "All Lives Matter." “Commercializing our differences will not help our local police and communities to build greater trust and respect for one another," said Canterbury in his original letter to Walmart. The Washington Post also reports that the Fraternal Order of Police sent a similar request to Amazon today, though the company has yet to comment on the issue.

The five wives enter the store to shop. Three minutes later, the husbands are released to find their spouses. “The participants cannot speak or use any electronic devices. “We watch on a split screen — with a floor-plan overhead shot on one side, and bread-crumb-trail GPS tracking — in a different color for each couple — on the other (like the old PAC-MAN game). The players are allowed to eat anything they want and use the restrooms. “The first couple to reunite wins $100 million. “If none of the players find each other by the end of the season (12 one-hour episodes), they all depart the store, and we watch them search for their cars.” Till death them did part Writes The Hastings Crazy Quilter: “This is my parents’ wedding picture. Aren’t they a beautiful young couple? “What you can’t see is the right side of my father’s face. The photographer carefully posed them to hide that side of his face, because it had been blown open by shrapnel on a hillside in Italy during World War II. As he and several others lay there, they were first visited by a medical corpsman, and then by two clergymen — one Catholic and one Lutheran — who crept up the hillside to give them aid and comfort. Brave men, one and all. “When he got back to the States, my dad was in the hospital for a long time. While he was lucky the shrapnel had missed major blood vessels, the wound extended from the middle of his cheek, down his neck and out toward his shoulder bone. He underwent several (six? seven?) surgeries to close the wound. Each time, it would break open and spread a little wider. “Through this time, my mother waited. And waited. And finally they decided they weren’t going to wait any more; the surgeries weren’t working, and it was time to get on with his life. He left the hospital, and they got married. Not a fancy wedding, because it was right after a war, but a lasting one. “November 23 would have been their 70th wedding anniversary. Happy Anniversary, Mom and Dad. I miss you both. “They really were the Greatest Generation. “Thirty-five years later, Mom and Dad visited Italy with my husband and me. Dad said he really hadn’t seen much of the country on his first visit. He had a much better visit the second time.” The Permanent Maternal Record And: ‘Tis the season! (Ah, the Smell of It Division) Dolly Dimples: “This is a tribute to my mom — and memories of Christmases past. “Memories of Christmases past can be triggered by many things — by a beautiful snowfall like we had this weekend, which transformed our ordinary-looking neighborhood into a Wonderful Winter Wonderland, or seeing houses and yards decked out in festive lights, or hearing favorite Christmas carols on the radio. What transports me into the Christmas seasons of the past is the fragrance of Christmas cookies being baked. “Mom baked lots of cookies, but Christmas cookies were baked only in season — and the variety was amazing. To name a few: cut-out cookies, sugar cookies, stollen, spritz, lebkuchen, pfeffernusse, anise, springerle, thumbprint, Christmas wreaths. Mom had all things in order when she was ready to make cookies. The bowls, utensils, ingredients were in place on the kitchen table, as well as the recipes (but I doubt she needed to refer to them). She was ready to start. “There were no electric mixers in those days. All batter had to be stirred by hand — vigorously. I marveled at the strength it took for Mom to spend hours mixing cookie dough and not seeming to tire. (I think it was the love she mixed in that kept her going.) “I tried to help. While Mom stirred and baked, she kept me busy with other tasks. My role was to sprinkle colored sugar on the cut-out cookies, to press the Hershey’s Kisses in the thumbprint indentations, to complete the sticky wreaths by placing the little red cinnamon candies in place. She’d put a package of Dromedary dates in front of me and instruct me to make a slit in each date, stuff in a half-walnut, and roll the date in granulated sugar. That was a treat we all enjoyed at Christmastime. Another favorite was baked apples. She would core the apples, and my job was to fill the cavity with the red cinnamon candies. When the apples emerged from the oven, they were fragrant, pink and soft inside the skin … and tasty. “I was fascinated when Mom made the springerle cookies. She sprinkled anise seeds on the baking board, placed the rolled-out dough on top of the seeds and pressed down on the springerle form. The little pictures of people working at trades were so clear and remained so when they were baked. Nowadays I believe springerle forms are rolling pins with designs etched in them, but Mom’s was a square metal plate on which the pictures were etched, and it was fastened to a wooden block. “With some guilt, I must admit I didn’t take after her, as baking was not one of my favorite things to do.”   Life as we know it Kathy S. of St. Paul writes: “This Christmas season has been shadowed for me, though I had the joy of attending a party yesterday where there was a bountiful bevy of beautiful babies. And what could be more fitting than that? “To cheer myself up, I am binge-watching the movie ‘Love Actually,’ on cable. Some channels are playing it two or three times in a row, so I can catch my favorite scenes or watch the whole thing. It follows a number of love stories: all the beginnings, then the ‘middles,’ and the denouements. Not all the stories are happy, but there is sheer joy in the cheerful ones. And the scene with Joni Mitchell’s song ‘Both Sides Now’ in the background truly makes you understand the words in that song. “What hooked me on this movie is the voice you hear at the beginning of the movie, as you see joyous people run to hug and kiss their loved ones. These scenes (and those at the end of the movie) were filmed clandestinely (and later OK’d) at Heathrow Airport near London. “The voice says that, on 9/11, people called from the Towers, etc., to tell people they loved them — and that love is all around us. “It’s a message I need to hear, this year.”   Our theater of seasons Reports KH of White Bear Lake: ‘Subject: For every season, there is a thing. “Spring is a wonderful time of year. Trees leaf out and flower. Grass turns green. The vista changes from monochrome to color. Days get longer and begin to warm. All things appearing to have been dead spring to back to life. It is a miraculous time. “Summer is a wonderful time of year. Fruit grows on trees, gardens flourish, and flowers produce more colors than a palette can hold. There is enough daylight for all our waking hours, with some left over. The sun finally removes all the memories of cold from our bones. “Fall is a wonderful time of year. The trees compete (or is it collaborate?) with the flowers to produce colors that inspire the use of the word brilliant. The nights chill, but the days warm as bountiful harvests take on a sense of urgency. “Winter is — cold, dark, messy. Or is it? This year, for the first time in my life, I decided to head for the woods and find out for myself. “The first day, after a fresh snow, I noticed tracks. Tracks of every size from mouse to deer. They were seemingly everywhere. Under a flowering crabapple tree, there weren’t just tracks; there had been a party. Deer and pheasants apparently had a late Thanksgiving feast. “The second day, I decided to see if I could be a witness to one of these parties. I stationed myself about 50 yards away from several of these trees and then waited motionlessly. The temperature was in the single digits. After nearly two hours, I was close to falling asleep when I saw movement out of the corner of my eye. In swooped a dozen pheasants. Six of them landed in two trees (females in one tree, males in the other). The rest landed on the ground under the trees. The ones in the trees began to attack the crabapples. Some they ate, and some fell down for those below. I tried not to scare them away with my gaping jaw. I was reminded of the photographer (Sean O’Connell) in the ‘Walter Mitty’ movie when he said: ‘Sometimes I don’t (take the picture). If I like a moment, for me, personally, I don’t like to have the distraction of a camera. I just want to stay in it.’ That, and I had left my camera in the car because it was too cold, and I hadn’t expected to see anything. “The next day, I decided to see if I could find a deer. I walked up and down rows of trees for several miles when suddenly I spotted a deer about a hundred yards away. He looked in my direction, and I froze. (Single-digit weather with a strong breeze will do that to a person.) Even though I didn’t move, I knew he could see my breath just as I could see his. Over the next 45 minutes, I inched closer. Every time he put his head down to eat, I shuffled a few inches closer. Then he would look up, and I would freeze. This went on until I was about 40 yards away. At that point, he’d had enough of the game and loped away. “This morning it was 19 degrees below zero. I decided to take my camera with me for a few minutes, just in case I saw something. And I did. “I saw this lone pheasant in a flowering crabapple tree, having breakfast in the brilliant sunlight. The pheasants usually won’t stay around long enough for a photo, but for some reason, this one did. After a few shots, I put the camera away and took my stroll. I followed my tracks from yesterday and soon noticed that I wasn’t the only one following my tracks. In each one of my shoe prints was a clear print of a fox or coyote. (I’m no expert on animal prints.) Suddenly I felt like a trail blazer. “On another portion of my walk, I noticed deer prints in my shoe prints. Then it occurred to me that they might have been following my tracks just like I follow theirs. “When I started this venture of embracing winter, I had hoped to find it tolerable. I found that it was neither tolerable, nor enjoyable. Instead it has been exhilarating, and dazzling. Despite what the mercury said, I never felt the cold. Cold, dark, messy? Maybe. But that’s not what I’m going to remember about this winter.”     Band Name of the Day: The Beautiful Babies Bulletin Board appears each Sunday in the Pioneer Press.

Photo: Nintendo The NES Classic Edition might be Nintendo’s most successful gaming console till date. It has better sales numbers than other consoles such as Nintendo Wii. The console, which was launched on Nov. 11, has been sold out on Amazon, Best Buy and Walmart.  Among big retailers, Target is still selling the console, but only in its brick-and-mortar stores. Owing to high demand, it is necessary for customers to look out for places to buy the console, which is where Meijer and B&H Photo Video come in. Related Stories Where To Buy NES Classic Edition: Stock Sparse At Walmart, Target, Toys 'R' Us, But Pricier Options Available Nintendo Black Friday Deals Meijer tweeted Wednesday that it would be selling NES Classic Edition in “limited quantities,” while B&H Photo Video will start selling the Classic Friday morning. In terms of purchasing a NES Classic Edition gaming console, physical stores seem to be the better bet compared to online ones, which have mostly run out of stock. The NES Classic Edition might become the highest selling gaming console of 2016, if the trend continues. NPD group projected that Nintendo had sold 196,000 gaming consoles in November alone. Since the device launched on Nov. 11, this means that it sold those numbers in just 19 days. Nintendo is expected to generate good sales of the Classic in the holiday season, if it can make stocks available in time, the possibility of which seems bleak now.

The surveillance footage, released by the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office on Wednesday, shows Michael Foster, 43, tackling Clarence Daniels from behind as he was walking into a Brandon, Fla. Wal-Mart on Tuesday. Foster followed Daniels into the store after seeing him exiting his vehicle with a gun holstered under his shirt — which was perfectly legal for the 62-year-old Daniels to do since he holds a concealed weapon license. Nevertheless, Foster tackled Daniels from behind as he entered the store, and put him in a chokehold before taking him to the ground. Witnesses said that Foster yelled out that Daniels had a gun. They also said that Daniels yelled out that he had a license for it. Foster called 911 only after he tackled accosted Daniels. He was arrested and charged with battery.

By the time most of us are cramming the Christmas wrapping paper into the rubbish and regretting that third serve of turkey, more than 2 million Ooshies will have been sold through Australian retail chains, as well as US and British retail behemoths such as Target and Walmart and Amazon. But the real power of these tiny comic book collectables is what they represent, an Australian business that has adapted to a rapidly changing retail landscape. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link Illustration: Simon Bosch.  It's responded to a retail revolution spearheaded by tech giant Amazon that threatens to unpick the fabric of traditional retail and stitch it back together as a consumer-led movement peopled by companies and brands that most of us have never even heard of yet. What the toys can teach retail is the value of agility and that big rewards are the pay off for big risks. Advertisement From shipping to shaping Headstart International's Ooshie toys are proving a Christmas hit. Ooshies only hit the supermarket shelves in May but Headstart's creative team is already working on new accessories, including "environments", which will be quickly developed and distributed around the world. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link The increasingly popular kids collectable has thrust Headstart International into the global playground.  "Because of our success we have committed to another four concepts and we are well under way with that," Headstart International's executive chairman David Hendy said. "Internationally this has suddenly given us credibility ... and in the next six months we will be selling Ooshies to the rest of the world." What's even more interesting than the Ooshie phenomenon is how these shrunk superheros fit into the evolution of Headstart, a business that up until three years ago was a distributor for the major licensed brands such as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, StarWars and Bratz. The turning point for Headstart was Guy Russo's transformation of the Kmart chain, a turnaround that radically reduced the number of brands the chain carried and also increased its direct sourcing of product. JB Hi-Fi, Harvey Norman and Myer are most at risk from Amazon's launch in Australia. Citi research note It's a trend that has permeated the entire discount department store sector as well as the broader retail market, as supermarkets, department stores and apparel chains battle the rising tide of costs. At the same time, Headstart, along with competitors such as Hunter Products, was watching the big toy companies take back control of their international distribution operations. They set up their own Australian offices and turned off the commission tap on big-name brands. Hendy saw the writing on the wall and established an in-house design team to create toy concepts and nurture a new revenue stream. "Prior to a couple of years ago, all we were doing was distributing [toys] for Australia," Hendy says. "When all the retailers made major changes, we thought perhaps we should make some changes too." The creative department is now Headstart's biggest team and Hendy is convinced the business is on the right track, despite the intense focus on price at Australia's major supermarket chains Coles and Woolworths as well as concerns over the future of the discount department store chains. "I'm sure a lot of people want price but when you get to toys it's more than just price," Hendy says. "It's about the product, it's about the brand, and in Australia compared to other parts of the world we've moved more quickly into price." Hunter Products distributes merchandise for some of the leading children's brands, including pester-power favourite Peppa Pig and Paw Patrol as well as sporting and outdoor lines such as Lance Franklin's Buddy Ball. However it's also investing in its own product lines and nurturing an overseas client network to diversify its revenue base. "We have learned to adapt to the requirements of the major retailers in Australia and maximise our opportunities here," Hunter's James Hunter says. "In addition, we have taken significant steps to diversify and develop our own products for the world market. "We have successfully shipped product to over 35 countries around the world and we were thrilled to ship our first products to customers in the United States in 2016. "There is no doubt tough times require businesses to think outside of their own small backyard and we are continuing to do that in looking at new opportunities and ideas." Endangered discounters Moose Toys CEO Paul Solomon. Photo: Simon Schluter Target's decision to abandon its toy sale this year had an impact on all of Australia's toy operators, who relied on the annual sale to get a "read" on the hot products for Christmas and adjust their order and supply chain accordingly. At the release of its first-quarter sales in October, Wesfarmers department store chief Guy Russo revealed the decision to cancel the annual toy sale cost it $75 million in lost toy sales at Target, as well as sales from adjacent categories such as kidswear. Target lost $50 million in 2016 and it's on track to post another big loss in the 2017 financial year after its same-store sales plunged 22 per cent in the September quarter and total sales fell 17 per cent to $643 million, suggesting the turnaround had stalled. The results have not shifted Russo's commitment to an every-day low price model at Target, the same model he instigated at Kmart. For now, insiders report it's working on a hybrid high-low, everyday low pricing model and making slow work of moving to the new pricing structure. Suppliers tell a slightly different story, reporting Target buyers were "highly motivated" to drive sales in the vital Christmas period and use any measure to move stock off the shelves, including discounting. Analysts are sceptical about whether Russo can turn Target around, with or without a toy sale. One retail insider has urged him to return Target to its "fashion roots" in 2017 and create a distinctly different identity to its fellow discount trader Kmart. The discount department stores are the "most endangered" species in the retail ecosystem, according to retail analyst Steve Kulmar, especially with Amazon on the horizon. Toy distributors claim Big W is enjoying a late surge in Christmas toy sales, but the outlook for the chain is uncertain after the jarring departure of chief Sally Macdonald in November, less than one year into the job. The star of Australia's toy sector is Moose Toys, which has turned its wildly popular Shopkins collectable into a global empire that's poised to take new territory as it rolls out licence agreements across multiple retail sectors, including apparel and even food. Co-chief Paul Solomon is confident there's a big role for bricks and mortar retailers but he believes the innovation that is at the heart of Moose can also future-proof Australia's big name chains. "Online is having a big impact on what's going on out there as have the international arrivals," Solomon says. "There's definitely a role for bricks and mortar retailers and a market for them but they've got to have a reason for being, a point of difference, something that's going to set them apart from the competition. "And that's the same for us." Shopkins phenomenon Moose's wildly popular Shopkins characters were named the Toy Industry Association's Girl Toy of the Year in 2015 and its Little Live Pets "Snuggles" puppy was the No.1 selling toy in Australia last week and destined to be sold out by Christmas Eve. Not bad for a business that was teetering on the brink of collapse in 2007 after it was engulfed in a scandal over traces of a "date rape" drug in its Bindeez craft kit toy. Nine years later, it's transformed Shopkins into an international lifestyle brand with a global following and significant growth potential but it's not chasing growth at any cost. "It's not necessarily about being everywhere, it's about being with the right retailers," Solomon says. "We are focused on creating great toys and helping our retail partners. "The industry we are in is truly magical, we are selling our toys to adults who get to give those toys to kids and that makes adults smile as well." Solomon said Moose prides itself on its partnerships with its retailers, including the major supermarket chains and discount department stores in Australia as well as US giants, including Target, Walmart and Toys "R" Us. Moose's financial results reflect the runaway success of its Australian-designed products, supporting a $57 million full-year net profit in fiscal 2016, a big jump from its $21 million net profit result a year earlier. The genius of collectables is they bring kids (and their parents) back to retailers again and again to expand or update their collection, building ant trails to the major bricks and mortar retailers as well as online operators like Amazon. Bring on Amazon The digital giant is expected to make landfall in Australia as early as next February and take a $4 billion bite out of Australia's retail revenue, a sector already under pressure from the exchange rate, labour costs as well as competition from online and international brands. Amazon Web Services staff have been working out of an office in Sydney for the past six months and some analysts claim Amazon could launch its Prime service as early as February next year followed by fresh food later in the calendar year. But not everyone is frightened of the US behemoth. Suppliers are excited, not anxious. They're counting down the days until they can sell through another major channel in what is a highly concentrated market. Headstart already sells its lines, including Ooshies, through Amazon in other parts of the world and Hendy believes an Australian launch is an "opportunity". "From my experience with Amazon in other countries, they buy locally and have depth in their range," Hendy says. "In Australia for a long time we've just had retail monopolies." The collapse of Dick Smith, the closure of Masters and the sale of The Good Guys have concentrated retail ownership across a number of influential sectors in Australia. JB Hi-Fi's $870 million purchase of The Good Guys chain in September reduced the appliance and electronics markets to an arm wrestle between JB Hi-Fi and Gerry Harvey's Harvey Norman. Woolworths' decision to finally draw a line under its massive losses from its disastrous Masters hardware chain left Wesfarmers' Bunnings in charge of the hardware market as Metcash finalises the integration of its Mitre 10 store network with the Home chain. Australia's grocery sector is where the concentration of ownership hits its high notes. This might explain why Coles' owner Wesfarmers and its chief Richard Goyder have been so vociferous in their commentary about Amazon. Coles' same-stores sales grew at their lowest level in seven years in the September quarter, and after years of double-digit gains, earnings growth has also slowed. Analysts suggest Coles may be on track to endure its first decline in earnings since Wesfarmers added the supermarket chain to its conglomerate in 2008, as the Woolworths turnaround gains momentum and competition from Aldi's new territories intensifies. But the business that successfully saw off Woolworthss epically unsuccessful assault on hardware cannot be underestimated. Goyder has been warning Australian retail to shape up for Amazon's arrival for years and Woolworths chairman Gordon Cairns revealed at its recent annual meeting that Australia's biggest supermarket chain had set up an internal "unit" to analyse this significant shift in Australian retail. The Woolworths Food Digital unit includes Tristan Butt, a former Amazon staffer, who moved to the team in November after heading up Woolworths' health, beauty and baby team for two years. In a letter to suppliers, Woolworths said Butt would help to "strengthen the collaboration" between its increasingly important online business with its commercial team. A recent Citi recent research note suggests JB Hi-Fi, Harvey Norman and Myer are most at risk from Amazon's launch in Australia, with the broker's head of research Craig Woolford suggesting JB Hi-Fi's earnings before interest and tax could track backwards by as much as 23 per cent. You won't hear any of this fear-mongering on the supply side of retail, especially not the grocery suppliers who are eagerly awaiting the arrival of the master disrupter. One supermarket supplier, who would only talk on the basis of anonymity, said he had already appointed a staff member to determine what Amazon might do to the Australian grocery market. He plans to take a look at Amazon's high-tech Seattle store as soon as possible, to get a clear idea of its bricks and mortar strategy. "Amazon's motto is 'your margin is our opportunity' and Coles and Woolworths are still the most profitable supermarkets in the world," the supplier says. He is optimistic about partnering with Amazon but he knows the supermarkets will have their game plan too and they're not going to get caught out by underestimating the global retailer. "They've learnt from the issues they've had with Aldi, which now has 12.5 per cent market share," says the supplier. The supermarkets won't make the same mistake they made with Aldi, they're not going to get caught out by underestimating Amazon. "If it doesn't happen in 2017 or 2018, it will happen sometime soon without a doubt and everyone from suppliers to retailers are reacting." Shopping for change The timing of Amazon's expected arrival coincides with a significant shift in social values in Australia and a move away from an era of social conservatism, according to research group Colmar Brunton. Research director Peter Kenny says the move to the so-called "rebellion" phase has big ramifications for retailers, particularly given the focus on price at the major retail chains in Australia. "There's a lot of discussion around price with campaigns like Coles' Down Down but people are not feeling like their products are getting cheaper," says Kenny. "We are going to see a willingness to change ... the next point on the [social] clock is the word 'better' and so people will look for a better way to do things. "It's already creeping into advertising with companies offering better financial services, better insurance, better milk products." Kenny says retailers need to think about another way to meet consumers' needs that is not just about price, including the supermarkets. "There's a battle about to come between Amazon, Alibaba and other new players that haven't even got to the market yet," Kenny says. "It won't be 2017 but in the years ahead there will be so many alternative channel options and they will be providing all sorts of new services. "And when they come, we will be very much in a period of reshaping the establishment model, which will affect all the retailers." Kenny claims too many of Australia's big retail brands have been doing too much of the same thing for too long. But former David Jones chief Paul Zahra argues these are big ships to turn around. Zahra, who is PwC's global retail adviser said both Target and Big W had to decide where they wanted to "play" in 2017, in a market where Wesfarmers' Kmart has already staked a claim on the lowest prices. "Suppliers complain retailers are myopically focused on price but that's because price is where the customer is as well," Zahra says. "It's much easier for a supplier to react than a retailer with a large workforce." SourceHub operates in the electronics market, developing and distributing private label product that is sold through traditional retail and online channels. The business has pushed into the international market in the past few years and offshore customers now represent about 40 per cent of its sales. "We pushed into Walmart because of the changes to retail in Australia," chief Vanessa Garrard says. "For us the growth had to come from leveraging into other countries." SourceHub has also focused on developing its own apps to sell to retailers along with popular consumer products. Garrard says for retailers like the discount department stores to survive they have to collaborate with suppliers and recognise that consumers are hungry for unique products. "It's naive [for the retailers] to think sourcing the same products from the same trade shows is a sustainable model," Garrard says. "I'm working through a major supermarket submission at the moment and the range is exactly the same as what's going into every other retailer, so it's just price fighting." And this is the challenge for Australian retail as Christmas bleeds into the new year, Boxing Day sales and the launch of yet another new season. Price alone will not buy consumer loyalty and that's a problem even a pocket-sized super hero can't solve. 0 comments Log in to comment New User?

(WKRN) – Two people were arrested earlier this month after police allegedly found them using heroin in their vehicle with two children inside. According to an arrest affidavit, Wesley Somers, 21, and Traci Orrand, 30, were both arrested and charged with two counts of child neglect and possession of a controlled substance. Metro police said they found a 2-year-old and 8-month-old in the backseat at the Walmart on Dickerson Pike. The 2-year-old was reportedly unrestrained in the back seat. Orrand was also in the backseat of a vehicle used to buy narcotics, according to police. Officers followed the vehicle to a Walmart parking lot where officers saw Somers and one other person using heroin. Orrand allegedly admitted to using heroin and taking her children with her to buy drugs. Both were booked in the Davidson County Jail and their bond has been set at $10,000 each. Somers is also wanted for an outstanding warrant in Sumner County. Police also arrested Benjamin Scharff, 38, at the Walmart on Dickerson Pike. According to an affidavit, police found nearly 20 grams of marijuana, a half gram of heroin and a cooking spoon with him.

A police officer in an area known for drug dealing and the homeless approached a car in a Walmart parking lot. As the officer approached the vehicle, he noticed the smell of body odor and urine similar to a “homeless camp,” according to his report. Inside the parked vehicle, he found Donell Barron and Rikki Hart, both 34, and their five severely malnourished children. The family had been living in the car for about two months after losing their home and staying in hotel rooms until they ran out of money. While parked at the Walmart Super Store in Greenacres, Florida, they bathed infrequently at a lake in a nearby park. The children’s age range is reported as 14, 8, 6, 5 and 4. The 14-year-old weighed only 50 pounds and was so thin his bones were clearly visible. In addition, the 8-year-old was suffering from high blood pressure and was also malnourished. The children only ate once a day with a meal that consisted of salad and bread. They had not been enrolled in school for an extended period and were homeschooled by their parents in the vehicle. It is reported that the children had not seen a doctor in several years. Barron and Hart reportedly run a blog website titled “Holistically Beautiful for ‘those interested in a holistic and balanced lifestyle.” The website states, “This blog was created by Donell and Rikki Barron in 2014 to show the benefits of living a healthier lifestyle and discuss topics which can enrich ones’ life. Donell has his Master’s Degree in Rehab Science/Substance Abuse and is a Writer, Holistic Living Consultant, Personal Trainer, and Motivational Speaker. His wife, Rikki, has her Bachelor’s is Speech Communication and has a background in Banking, Dance Therapy, Childbirth Preparation and is also an Holistic Living Consultant. They believe in the importance of living a balanced life and the importance of constantly improving oneself. They currently reside in FL and they have been coaching others to live balanced lives for 10 years.” At the time of his arrest, Barron stated to police that he was Native American and “is not property of the US or any corporation.” In addition, he stated that he practices law but is not a lawyer. The children are now in state custody and the parents face five counts of criminal child neglect. They are being held in Palm Beach County Jail in lieu of $1K bail.

Matthew Mills of Biddeford, Maine posted the picture on Sunday and it has since been shared thousands of times. He captioned the photo with “This guy got a lesson in parking.” Since the photo was posted, a man who says he’s a friend of the driver told WMTW-TV that it was an accident because of snow and ice and says the photo was taken after it melted. “She came into work and slid into her spot because of an icy spot and couldn’t park straight and then someone rudely put carts around her car,” the friend said.

Phoebe Sheehan psheehan@centredaily.com 1 of 5 i By Lori Falce lfalce@centredaily.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story DECATUR TOWNSHIP, Clearfield County The office building near Philipsburg didn’t look much like the North Pole. There were Wal-Mart semis outside instead of sleighs. The elves were about six feet tall and debating where they should pick up pizza for lunch. The workshop was an empty room with bags organized by numbers. The one thing that seemed right on point was the little woman in the heart of it all. Judy Sinclair, in her festive sweatshirt, marshaled her forces, organized her charts and got Christmas happening for hundreds of families in need who signed up for the Christmas program at the Moshannon Valley branch of the YMCA of Centre County. On Sinclair’s detailed list were the names of 205 families. Each name corresponded to a numbered bag — some a giant festively decorated gift bag but most a simple opaque black — filled with the things that would turn a normal day into a holiday for a whole family. A coat for each family member. Some warm clothes. New socks. And a present for each child. A parade of families — mostly a parade of moms with the occasional tag-along child unaware of what was actually happening — came in to the makeshift wonderland on Monday one or two at a time. They would give Sinclair their names. She would call out the right number. One helper would dash off to grab the corresponding bag and take it to the family’s car. “Food!” Sinclair would say sometimes. Then the families that weren’t already getting a holiday dinner from another agency got a box with a turkey, 10 pounds of potatoes and more festive fixings. It’s been happening for 37 years. Sinclair says it started simply, when a local cable company ran a special one season. Donate a toy, get HBO for free. It got a lot of new HBO subscribers and a lot of toys. The cable company reached out to the Y. Did they have any idea what kids might need some toys? They did. And those few toys way back then grew and grew and grew. “I couldn’t believe it,” Howard Long, CEO of the YMCA of Centre County, said of his first year watching the Christmas program unfold in front of him. The other Centre County locations do smaller programs, but nothing like the Mo Valley event that puts toys in the hands of more than 500 kids. After the Philipsburg Y joined the Centre County overall group a few years ago, Long saw it all up close and personal and was amazed. “It’s incredible,” he said. Sinclair estimates the value of gifts, coats and food given out this year at more than $100,000, and believes that the program has given out well more than $1 million in good cheer over the years. With so many parts coming from donations from other groups, it’s hard to calculate. While the Y puts the presents in families’ hands, it gets a boost from other local groups like Kiwanis — which buys a lot of the coats when they go on sale at the end of the season — and the National Wild Turkey Federation. Plenty of the food comes from collections at Philipsburg-Osceola school concerts. “This is really a year-round thing,” Sinclair said. But why do so many people put so much effort into that one day for parents to show their kids a great holiday? “I don’t do it for the parents,” Sinclair said. “It’s all about the kids. Every kid deserves to go back to school in new clothes in January. Every kid deserves to have a new toy to take to show-and-tell. Every kid.” Lori Falce: 814-235-3910, @LoriFalce Related content LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Philipsburg Suggested for you   Comments Videos facebook twitter email Share More Videos 1:56 A Dog's Tale from Jail helps inmates and furry friends Pause 1:33 James Franklin explains what cost Penn State the Rose Bowl 1:06 You've got to see how State College's ice sculptures were made 1:43 Avoid Tanning Beds to Prevent Skin Cancer 3:22 Remapping the human mesentery in a way never seen before 1:03 Malcolm Morrison gives a tour of his Aero Commander U9 1:28 Sheriff: multiple people have died in shooting at Fort Lauderdale airport 1:33 Students hold #NotMyPresident protest at Penn State 0:24 Saquon Barkley thanks seniors for keeping the program together 0:24 Saquon Barkley will use loss as motivation Share Video Video link: Select Embed code: Select facebook twitter email a day ago Funeral procession for Trooper Landon Weaver 2:06 a day ago Funeral procession for Trooper Landon Weaver 1:02 12 hours ago Rings trailer 3:22 2 days ago Remapping the human mesentery in a way never seen before View more video Philipsburg Fire destroys Philipsburg auto shop Osceola Mills intersection sees change in traffic signal, signage Community rallies around family who lost Rush Township home in fire Retired P-O teacher celebrates 85th birthday with ‘whole town’ Fire ignites ammunition, destroys Rush Township home Editor's Choice Videos Subscriptions Digital Subscriptions Subscriber Services e-Edition Home Delivery Vacation Hold Site Information Customer Service About Us Contact Us Photo Store Social, Mobile & More Mobile & Apps Facebook Twitter YouTube Advertising Information Place a Classified Local Deals Shopping Place an Obituary Today's Circulars Copyright Privacy Policy Terms of Service Subscriptions Digital Subscriptions Subscriber Services e-Edition Home Delivery Vacation Hold Site Information Customer Service About Us Contact Us Photo Store Social, Mobile & More Mobile & Apps Facebook Twitter YouTube Advertising Information Place a Classified Local Deals Shopping Place an Obituary Today's Circulars More Copyright Privacy Policy Terms of Service

EMBED </>More News Videos <iframe width="476" height="267" src="http://abc7ny.com/video/embed/?pid=1671979" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe> Candance McCowan reports on procrastinators who hit the mall on Christmas Eve to finish their shopping WABC Saturday, December 24, 2016 ELMHURST, Queens (WABC) -- The last-minute holiday shopping rush came to its frantic conclusion Saturday, and Christmas Eve rain wasn't enough to keep procrastinators from hitting stores and malls in an effort to complete their gift lists. Shopping centers like the Queens Center Mall stayed open late to help out, as retailers across the country wheeled out the savings and cleaned house before the even steeper post-Christmas sales promotions begin. Online shipping deadlines had long passed, but many retailers offered other ways to get gifts at the last minute, whether it was staying open through the wee hours of the night like Toys R Us or offering Christmas Eve store pickup like Walmart. Many stores extended their hours in the days leading up to Christmas. Toys R Us stayed open until 9 p.m. on Christmas Eve, while Kohl's and Macy's were 24/7 over the past few days until 6 p.m. Christmas Eve. Sears closed at 6 p.m. on Christmas Eve, while Target was open until at least 10 p.m. on Christmas Eve. K-Mart and Big Lots also had extended Christmas Eve hours until 10, while most other retailers closed up shop at 6 or 7 p.m. If you couldn't make it to the mall, a quick stop at a drug or specialty store worked for many. CVS, Walgreens and Rite Aid are increasingly stocking their shelves with more toys for the little ones, and those three drugstores also have a big selection of plastic gift cards for use at other stores. Meanwhile, office supplies store Staples sells flying drones and adult coloring books, while Dick's Sporting Goods has Apple Watches, headphones and GoPro cameras. Then there were websites of some major stores that offered a way to give an instant gift, called an e-gift. It's similar to a gift card, but is supposed to be a little more personal: You choose the item you want to buy - say sneakers or a sweater - click the "E-Gift" or "GiftNow" button, pay, and then the recipient gets an email telling them you bought them a gift. The gift receiver accepts it and can make adjustments, such as changing the color or size, before it ships. Or they can just get something else entirely from the store. The service carries no extra charges to the gift giver or receiver, and is available on several websites, including Saks Fifth Avenue, Nordstrom and Ralph Lauren. The luckiest of the bunch may have been Amazon Prime members, though, as online retailer let shoppers in Miami, New York and other cities order toys, electronics and other gifts as late as 9:45 p.m. on Christmas Eve for delivery in two hours, meaning it would arrive by midnight. Still, procrastination may work in your favor if you end up not seeing a person you're shopping for until after Christmas. That's when after-holiday sales kick in. If the timing works, you'll likely pay less for a gift than you would if you had bought it before the holidays.

(Photo/Riverdale Police Department via Facebook) Friday, December 23, 2016 RIVERDALE, New Jersey -- Police say a woman seen on video picking up a wallet at a New Jersey Walmart store has been located and issued a summons, and the wallet has been returned. Riverdale police said a 15-year-old girl dropped her wallet in the store Sunday while shopping for a Christmas gift her grandmother, who had just lost her husband of 69 years three weeks ago. In her wallet was $125 cash she collected from her own birthday last week. Surveillance video showed another shopper - a woman - walk by the girl and kick the wallet away while the teen is shopping, police said. The woman is then seen picking up the wallet and leaving. Police said she didn't turn it over to Walmart staff or to law enforcement officials. On Thursday, police met with the woman seen on the video. The wallet and cash were returned, and the woman was issued a summons for theft of property lost. She was released with a future court date. Police say she is from the North Jersey area, but that due to the vast amount of social media attention and to protect the defendant, her name and location are being withheld.

Memphis Mayor Jim Strickland’s office, Memphis Fire Department, and Walmart teamed up to make the holidays happier for 80 kids, spreading Christmas cheer all around. “Do we have any future firefighters here?” Memphis Fire Department Director Gina Sweat asked. “Raise your hand. I hope to see some fire trucks in those baskets today that you’ll get for Christmas.” Parents were excited to see their children light up with joy. “This is a blessing,” mother of five Stacie Jackson said. “They are so excited; they don’t know what to do. They are just picking up everything they can.” A significant donation allowed Walmart on Elvis Presley Boulevard to hand out $150 to each child and firefighters helped pick out gifts for the kids. “We’re trying to make sure the community understands that we are here for the community and we want to continue to be here for the community…our support to the community,” Kendale Hutton with Walmart said. Days before Christmas, great excitement and gratitude filled the aisles for dozens of young children and their families. Copyright 2016 WMC Action News 5. All rights reserved.

Michigan Ave. in Saline as part of Warm the Children, a program that provides children with winter clothes. Siblings Juwone, 12; Tyana, 10; Jaylen, 9; and Tiera, 5, waited patiently as their mom zipped up coats and helped them to try on boots. The Phelan's youngest daughter, 3-year-old Ta'Nya, sat in a cart as the older siblings finished their shopping. Mary Stewart is the campaign's program coordinator in Washtenaw and Livingston counties, and was there to help the children try on coats. Stewart's father, Mack W. Stewart, was a publisher of a newspaper in Connecticut when he was inspired to start the Warm the Children campaign after seeing some children waiting for the school bus in clothing that did little to protect them from the elements. Since 1988, the national initiative has connected local newspapers and service organizations to raise donations to provide warm winter clothing for local children. The program for Washtenaw and Livingston counties recently secured a new partnership with the Kiwanis Club and Foundation of Ann Arbor. The Kiwanis Club has aided the Warm the Children campaign over the past several years through volunteers who assist children with shopping for winter clothing items. Warm the Children continues with support from Ann Arbor's Kiwanis Club The Ann Arbor group is one of many Kiwanis organizations across the United States that participate and partner with the Warm the Children campaign, Stewart said.   "I'm excited to partner with them to sponsor the program. They are so well-known in the community," Stewart said. "They've done it for years, they've shopped with the families and see how much it means to the family to have warm clothes for the kids." For the Phelan family, the Warm the Children campaign has been a big help in getting their children ready for the Michigan winter. "It seems like every year, we got to get some more boots," said their father, Juwone Phelan, noting how fast the children grow and then outgrow their clothing. "It means a lot." Phelan is happy to be home with his family for Christmas; he said he is on dialysis and recently finished chemotherapy. "Just being with the family," Phelan said when asked about his plans for the weekend, adding that they are going to visit family and share a holiday meal together. As their mother finished up shopping, the younger Juwone talked about wanting a hover board for Christmas. He tried one before and liked the experience.  "I went pretty far," Juwone said. His brother, Jaylen, said he asked Santa Claus for a Lego Dimensions video game featuring some of his favorite characters, like Batman and Robin. Reaching into the cart, he showed off a Minecraft shirt he picked out himself. Walmart Assistant Manager Denise Jones scanned the items for the Phelan family as Stewart placed their purchases in bags to take home and celebrate over the Christmas weekend. Jones has seen around 1,700 children come through Walmart and pick out a new coat or winter boots as part of Warm the Children. It is a program she and Walmart are happy to support, even organizing smaller items like gloves and socks so the children were able to reach the $90 voucher limit on items. "This year, we were all prepared for it," Jones said. "We love the program, it's such a good program." The children are planning to wear their new pajamas Christmas Eve, with Tyana especially excited about her hot pink Hello Kitty pajamas, and went up to thank Stewart, a smile on her face as she spoke to each one. The family exchanged hugs with Stewart and wished everyone a merry Christmas as they left Walmart to get ready for the holiday weekend. "Merry Christmas!" shouted Ta'Nya from her spot in the shopping cart.  The Ann Arbor Area Community Foundation and Old National Bank are sponsors of the Warm the Children campaign this year. The Warm the Children campaign is accepting donations for next year's program. Those interested in contributing can visit the Ann Arbor Area Community Foundation site and see how they can donate.

The surveillance footage, released by the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office on Wednesday, shows Michael Foster, 43, tackling Clarence Daniels from behind as he was walking into a Brandon, Fla. Wal-Mart on Tuesday. Foster followed Daniels into the store after seeing him exiting his vehicle with a gun holstered under his shirt — which was perfectly legal for the 62-year-old Daniels to do since he holds a concealed weapon license. Nevertheless, Foster tackled Daniels from behind as he entered the store, and put him in a chokehold before taking him to the ground. Witnesses said that Foster yelled out that Daniels had a gun. They also said that Daniels yelled out that he had a license for it. Foster called 911 only after he tackled accosted Daniels. He was arrested and charged with battery.

By the time most of us are cramming the Christmas wrapping paper into the rubbish and regretting that third serve of turkey, more than 2 million Ooshies will have been sold through Australian retail chains, as well as US and British retail behemoths such as Target and Walmart and Amazon. But the real power of these tiny comic book collectables is what they represent, an Australian business that has adapted to a rapidly changing retail landscape. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link Illustration: Simon Bosch.  It's responded to a retail revolution spearheaded by tech giant Amazon that threatens to unpick the fabric of traditional retail and stitch it back together as a consumer-led movement peopled by companies and brands that most of us have never even heard of yet. What the toys can teach retail is the value of agility and that big rewards are the pay off for big risks. Advertisement From shipping to shaping Headstart International's Ooshie toys are proving a Christmas hit. Ooshies only hit the supermarket shelves in May but Headstart's creative team is already working on new accessories, including "environments", which will be quickly developed and distributed around the world. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link The increasingly popular kids collectable has thrust Headstart International into the global playground.  "Because of our success we have committed to another four concepts and we are well under way with that," Headstart International's executive chairman David Hendy said. "Internationally this has suddenly given us credibility ... and in the next six months we will be selling Ooshies to the rest of the world." What's even more interesting than the Ooshie phenomenon is how these shrunk superheros fit into the evolution of Headstart, a business that up until three years ago was a distributor for the major licensed brands such as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, StarWars and Bratz. The turning point for Headstart was Guy Russo's transformation of the Kmart chain, a turnaround that radically reduced the number of brands the chain carried and also increased its direct sourcing of product. JB Hi-Fi, Harvey Norman and Myer are most at risk from Amazon's launch in Australia. Citi research note It's a trend that has permeated the entire discount department store sector as well as the broader retail market, as supermarkets, department stores and apparel chains battle the rising tide of costs. At the same time, Headstart, along with competitors such as Hunter Products, was watching the big toy companies take back control of their international distribution operations. They set up their own Australian offices and turned off the commission tap on big-name brands. Hendy saw the writing on the wall and established an in-house design team to create toy concepts and nurture a new revenue stream. "Prior to a couple of years ago, all we were doing was distributing [toys] for Australia," Hendy says. "When all the retailers made major changes, we thought perhaps we should make some changes too." The creative department is now Headstart's biggest team and Hendy is convinced the business is on the right track, despite the intense focus on price at Australia's major supermarket chains Coles and Woolworths as well as concerns over the future of the discount department store chains. "I'm sure a lot of people want price but when you get to toys it's more than just price," Hendy says. "It's about the product, it's about the brand, and in Australia compared to other parts of the world we've moved more quickly into price." Hunter Products distributes merchandise for some of the leading children's brands, including pester-power favourite Peppa Pig and Paw Patrol as well as sporting and outdoor lines such as Lance Franklin's Buddy Ball. However it's also investing in its own product lines and nurturing an overseas client network to diversify its revenue base. "We have learned to adapt to the requirements of the major retailers in Australia and maximise our opportunities here," Hunter's James Hunter says. "In addition, we have taken significant steps to diversify and develop our own products for the world market. "We have successfully shipped product to over 35 countries around the world and we were thrilled to ship our first products to customers in the United States in 2016. "There is no doubt tough times require businesses to think outside of their own small backyard and we are continuing to do that in looking at new opportunities and ideas." Endangered discounters Moose Toys CEO Paul Solomon. Photo: Simon Schluter Target's decision to abandon its toy sale this year had an impact on all of Australia's toy operators, who relied on the annual sale to get a "read" on the hot products for Christmas and adjust their order and supply chain accordingly. At the release of its first-quarter sales in October, Wesfarmers department store chief Guy Russo revealed the decision to cancel the annual toy sale cost it $75 million in lost toy sales at Target, as well as sales from adjacent categories such as kidswear. Target lost $50 million in 2016 and it's on track to post another big loss in the 2017 financial year after its same-store sales plunged 22 per cent in the September quarter and total sales fell 17 per cent to $643 million, suggesting the turnaround had stalled. The results have not shifted Russo's commitment to an every-day low price model at Target, the same model he instigated at Kmart. For now, insiders report it's working on a hybrid high-low, everyday low pricing model and making slow work of moving to the new pricing structure. Suppliers tell a slightly different story, reporting Target buyers were "highly motivated" to drive sales in the vital Christmas period and use any measure to move stock off the shelves, including discounting. Analysts are sceptical about whether Russo can turn Target around, with or without a toy sale. One retail insider has urged him to return Target to its "fashion roots" in 2017 and create a distinctly different identity to its fellow discount trader Kmart. The discount department stores are the "most endangered" species in the retail ecosystem, according to retail analyst Steve Kulmar, especially with Amazon on the horizon. Toy distributors claim Big W is enjoying a late surge in Christmas toy sales, but the outlook for the chain is uncertain after the jarring departure of chief Sally Macdonald in November, less than one year into the job. The star of Australia's toy sector is Moose Toys, which has turned its wildly popular Shopkins collectable into a global empire that's poised to take new territory as it rolls out licence agreements across multiple retail sectors, including apparel and even food. Co-chief Paul Solomon is confident there's a big role for bricks and mortar retailers but he believes the innovation that is at the heart of Moose can also future-proof Australia's big name chains. "Online is having a big impact on what's going on out there as have the international arrivals," Solomon says. "There's definitely a role for bricks and mortar retailers and a market for them but they've got to have a reason for being, a point of difference, something that's going to set them apart from the competition. "And that's the same for us." Shopkins phenomenon Moose's wildly popular Shopkins characters were named the Toy Industry Association's Girl Toy of the Year in 2015 and its Little Live Pets "Snuggles" puppy was the No.1 selling toy in Australia last week and destined to be sold out by Christmas Eve. Not bad for a business that was teetering on the brink of collapse in 2007 after it was engulfed in a scandal over traces of a "date rape" drug in its Bindeez craft kit toy. Nine years later, it's transformed Shopkins into an international lifestyle brand with a global following and significant growth potential but it's not chasing growth at any cost. "It's not necessarily about being everywhere, it's about being with the right retailers," Solomon says. "We are focused on creating great toys and helping our retail partners. "The industry we are in is truly magical, we are selling our toys to adults who get to give those toys to kids and that makes adults smile as well." Solomon said Moose prides itself on its partnerships with its retailers, including the major supermarket chains and discount department stores in Australia as well as US giants, including Target, Walmart and Toys "R" Us. Moose's financial results reflect the runaway success of its Australian-designed products, supporting a $57 million full-year net profit in fiscal 2016, a big jump from its $21 million net profit result a year earlier. The genius of collectables is they bring kids (and their parents) back to retailers again and again to expand or update their collection, building ant trails to the major bricks and mortar retailers as well as online operators like Amazon. Bring on Amazon The digital giant is expected to make landfall in Australia as early as next February and take a $4 billion bite out of Australia's retail revenue, a sector already under pressure from the exchange rate, labour costs as well as competition from online and international brands. Amazon Web Services staff have been working out of an office in Sydney for the past six months and some analysts claim Amazon could launch its Prime service as early as February next year followed by fresh food later in the calendar year. But not everyone is frightened of the US behemoth. Suppliers are excited, not anxious. They're counting down the days until they can sell through another major channel in what is a highly concentrated market. Headstart already sells its lines, including Ooshies, through Amazon in other parts of the world and Hendy believes an Australian launch is an "opportunity". "From my experience with Amazon in other countries, they buy locally and have depth in their range," Hendy says. "In Australia for a long time we've just had retail monopolies." The collapse of Dick Smith, the closure of Masters and the sale of The Good Guys have concentrated retail ownership across a number of influential sectors in Australia. JB Hi-Fi's $870 million purchase of The Good Guys chain in September reduced the appliance and electronics markets to an arm wrestle between JB Hi-Fi and Gerry Harvey's Harvey Norman. Woolworths' decision to finally draw a line under its massive losses from its disastrous Masters hardware chain left Wesfarmers' Bunnings in charge of the hardware market as Metcash finalises the integration of its Mitre 10 store network with the Home chain. Australia's grocery sector is where the concentration of ownership hits its high notes. This might explain why Coles' owner Wesfarmers and its chief Richard Goyder have been so vociferous in their commentary about Amazon. Coles' same-stores sales grew at their lowest level in seven years in the September quarter, and after years of double-digit gains, earnings growth has also slowed. Analysts suggest Coles may be on track to endure its first decline in earnings since Wesfarmers added the supermarket chain to its conglomerate in 2008, as the Woolworths turnaround gains momentum and competition from Aldi's new territories intensifies. But the business that successfully saw off Woolworthss epically unsuccessful assault on hardware cannot be underestimated. Goyder has been warning Australian retail to shape up for Amazon's arrival for years and Woolworths chairman Gordon Cairns revealed at its recent annual meeting that Australia's biggest supermarket chain had set up an internal "unit" to analyse this significant shift in Australian retail. The Woolworths Food Digital unit includes Tristan Butt, a former Amazon staffer, who moved to the team in November after heading up Woolworths' health, beauty and baby team for two years. In a letter to suppliers, Woolworths said Butt would help to "strengthen the collaboration" between its increasingly important online business with its commercial team. A recent Citi recent research note suggests JB Hi-Fi, Harvey Norman and Myer are most at risk from Amazon's launch in Australia, with the broker's head of research Craig Woolford suggesting JB Hi-Fi's earnings before interest and tax could track backwards by as much as 23 per cent. You won't hear any of this fear-mongering on the supply side of retail, especially not the grocery suppliers who are eagerly awaiting the arrival of the master disrupter. One supermarket supplier, who would only talk on the basis of anonymity, said he had already appointed a staff member to determine what Amazon might do to the Australian grocery market. He plans to take a look at Amazon's high-tech Seattle store as soon as possible, to get a clear idea of its bricks and mortar strategy. "Amazon's motto is 'your margin is our opportunity' and Coles and Woolworths are still the most profitable supermarkets in the world," the supplier says. He is optimistic about partnering with Amazon but he knows the supermarkets will have their game plan too and they're not going to get caught out by underestimating the global retailer. "They've learnt from the issues they've had with Aldi, which now has 12.5 per cent market share," says the supplier. The supermarkets won't make the same mistake they made with Aldi, they're not going to get caught out by underestimating Amazon. "If it doesn't happen in 2017 or 2018, it will happen sometime soon without a doubt and everyone from suppliers to retailers are reacting." Shopping for change The timing of Amazon's expected arrival coincides with a significant shift in social values in Australia and a move away from an era of social conservatism, according to research group Colmar Brunton. Research director Peter Kenny says the move to the so-called "rebellion" phase has big ramifications for retailers, particularly given the focus on price at the major retail chains in Australia. "There's a lot of discussion around price with campaigns like Coles' Down Down but people are not feeling like their products are getting cheaper," says Kenny. "We are going to see a willingness to change ... the next point on the [social] clock is the word 'better' and so people will look for a better way to do things. "It's already creeping into advertising with companies offering better financial services, better insurance, better milk products." Kenny says retailers need to think about another way to meet consumers' needs that is not just about price, including the supermarkets. "There's a battle about to come between Amazon, Alibaba and other new players that haven't even got to the market yet," Kenny says. "It won't be 2017 but in the years ahead there will be so many alternative channel options and they will be providing all sorts of new services. "And when they come, we will be very much in a period of reshaping the establishment model, which will affect all the retailers." Kenny claims too many of Australia's big retail brands have been doing too much of the same thing for too long. But former David Jones chief Paul Zahra argues these are big ships to turn around. Zahra, who is PwC's global retail adviser said both Target and Big W had to decide where they wanted to "play" in 2017, in a market where Wesfarmers' Kmart has already staked a claim on the lowest prices. "Suppliers complain retailers are myopically focused on price but that's because price is where the customer is as well," Zahra says. "It's much easier for a supplier to react than a retailer with a large workforce." SourceHub operates in the electronics market, developing and distributing private label product that is sold through traditional retail and online channels. The business has pushed into the international market in the past few years and offshore customers now represent about 40 per cent of its sales. "We pushed into Walmart because of the changes to retail in Australia," chief Vanessa Garrard says. "For us the growth had to come from leveraging into other countries." SourceHub has also focused on developing its own apps to sell to retailers along with popular consumer products. Garrard says for retailers like the discount department stores to survive they have to collaborate with suppliers and recognise that consumers are hungry for unique products. "It's naive [for the retailers] to think sourcing the same products from the same trade shows is a sustainable model," Garrard says. "I'm working through a major supermarket submission at the moment and the range is exactly the same as what's going into every other retailer, so it's just price fighting." And this is the challenge for Australian retail as Christmas bleeds into the new year, Boxing Day sales and the launch of yet another new season. Price alone will not buy consumer loyalty and that's a problem even a pocket-sized super hero can't solve. 0 comments Log in to comment New User?

Are Any Banks Open? Shopping 50 0 0 December 23, 2016 2016 Christmas Hours: What Hours Are Stores And Restaurants Open On Christmas Day And Night? Are Any Banks Open? Danny Cox Christmas Day and into the night will be a time for those wanting to be with their friends, family, and loved ones so that they can enjoy gifts, togetherness, and great food. While it should be a day for either being at home with loved ones or traveling to see them, there are those times you need to head out and pick up one or two or 20 things. Here are the stores and restaurants you can visit or head out to and their hours on Christmas Day 2016. While many are about to start watching for the bearded man in the red suit on Santa Trackers, others will be heading out to get last-minute gifts or items for Christmas meals. If you’re planning on doing any kind of end-of-the-holiday gathering, you may want to do it early because there won’t be a lot open on Christmas Day itself. One big word of warning is to always call ahead to your local store or restaurant and make sure it is open before driving out to it. Not all branches or locations will always have their doors unlocked on Christmas so be prepared for a lot of closures. Stores Closed on Christmas Day 2016: Academy Sports Apple Store Bed, Bath & Beyond Best Buy Big Lots BJ’s Wholesale Club Costco Dollar General GameStop Gap Hobby Lobby IKEA JCPenney Kmart Kohl’s Macy’s Marshalls Meijer Michaels Nordstrom Old Navy Office Depot/Office Max Publix REI Sears Staples Target TJ Maxx Toys ‘R Us Walmart [Image by Joe Raedle/Getty Images] The majority to all of those stores will be open starting on Dec. 26, and that is when the ever-popular “Day After Christmas” sales will start, but not on the holiday. A few places will be open, though, and that is pretty much limited to pharmacies, some groceries, and a number of convenience stores. As reported by the New York Times, places like Walmart (6 p.m.) and Target (10 or 11 p.m.) will close early on Christmas Eve and be closed all the way through Christmas. Kohl’s is still open 24 hours and going until either 6 or 7 p.m. on Christmas Eve. Grocery Stores and Pharmacies open on Christmas Day 2016: Albertsons: 10 a.m. – 4 p.m. CVS Family Dollar Kroger Rite Aid Walgreens 7-Eleven Now, there are going to be those who celebrated with a big lunch or dinner with their families on Christmas Eve. That could leave you without a celebratory meal on Christmas day or night and have you wondering what to do to quench your hunger pains. Maybe you won’t feel like cooking another big meal or anything at all, and the option to go out to eat is still there. Well, the possibility is there but there aren’t many options as a number of restaurants will indeed be closed for the holiday. Due to many restaurants being franchised out, there are even those who may have one location open but not another. Always call ahead to your nearest location to make sure they’re open before venturing out on Christmas. That is especially true for restaurants and while it would be great to have a home-cooked meal, sometimes, that just isn’t possible. Here are the restaurants that are open on Christmas Day 2016: Applebee’s Baskin-Robbins (Closing early) Boston Market Buca di Beppo Buffalo Wild Wings Denny’s Dominos Dunkin’ Donuts (Some locations open) Golden Corral IHOP Jack in the Box McDonald’s Panda Express Perkins Pizza Hut Ruby Tuesday Ruth’s Chris Steak House Sizzler Sonic Drive-In Starbucks Coffee (Not all locations will open) Subway Waffle House [Image by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images] Now, there is one other business that a lot of people end up worrying about when it comes to Christmas Eve and Christmas Day and that is their bank. Believe it or not, there will be 23 different banks open on Christmas Eve, according to Go Banking Rates, but make sure to check with your local branch for exact hours. On Christmas Day, no banks will be open, as it is one of the 10 holidays recognized by the Federal Reserve. They are set to reopen for business on Monday, Dec. 26, and get things back into working order before the New Year’s Eve weekend. Store and restaurant hours are going to be extremely limited to nonexistent on Christmas Day 2016 in many locations. Even on Christmas Eve, there will be stores, restaurants, and other businesses that close early so employees can get home for the holidays. With very little time until the big day arrives, it may be best to get as much of your gift and food shopping, along with all other errands, done before December 25.

KGW viewer Alisa Wise was in line at Walmart, picking up last-minute items for her family’s annual Christmas Eve sledding trip, when she noticed the man in line in front of her, step ahead of the woman in front of him. Then this happened:   “Standing in front of this man was a cute, young, pregnant gal who had a cart load of groceries and toys,” Wise said. “I was a little confused when I saw him run his credit card. ‘She must have not had enough money’ I thought, ‘that was nice of him.’ The gal came to him and shook his hand and thanked him graciously. The cashier printed the receipt and gave it to the man, and he quickly gave it to the gal. Then the cashier says, ‘That is such a wonderful thing to do!’” Wise said the man smiled, looked at her and said, “I do it every year. It’s become a tradition.” “This amazing man just bought the entire cart full of groceries and toys for this young, pregnant mother!” Wise said. “My heart swelled and I almost began to cry right there in the Walmart line! A little Christmas miracle right there in the line of our local Walmart! Faith in humanity alive and well!  Christmas love lit up and I was left wondering what I can do today to make someone's days a little brighter!” What a wonderful gesture!

Find A Full List Of Store Hours And What’s Closed On December 24 BuzzWorthy 15 0 0 December 23, 2016 Christmas Eve 2016: Are Banks Open Today? Find A Full List Of Store Hours And What’s Closed On December 24 Nathan Francis Christmas Eve 2016 is here, but those looking to make a trip to the bank or just finding out which stores are open or closed might have a difficult time. The day before Christmas is one for meeting with family, sharing a meal, opening some early presents — and for many people, doing a lot of last-minute errands to get all of that ready. But with some stores open and some closed, others closing early, and a select few staying open all 24 hours, it’s hard to tell how to schedule all those stops. So those looking to schedule a few last-minute stops on December 24 can find a full list of what’s open and what’s closed on Christmas Eve below. What’s closed on Christmas Eve 2016 The list of what’s closed on Christmas Eve 2016 is actually quite short. While most stores and restaurants are closing early to give their employees a chance to spend the holiday at home, few are actually closed during the day. Banks appear to be the main exception. Many financial institutions will be closed, but largely because December 24 happens to fall on a Saturday. Those that normally offer Saturday hours will stay on the same schedule, and anyone who needs to make a late deposit can make use of the “smart” ATMs offered by institutions like Bank of America. Municipal offices will also mostly be closed on Christmas Eve. What’s open on Christmas Eve 2016 Those looking to do some shopping or make a stop are in luck, as most every store will be open on Christmas Eve, at least for some hours. It is not a federal holiday, so government offices like the United States Post Office will be open. But Christmas Eve does fall on a Saturday, so the offices that are normally closed on the weekend will remain that way. Most stores are open at least during the day on Christmas Eve, though most are also closing early. Target will be open until either 10 p.m. or 11 p.m. depending on the location — and will also be closed on Christmas Day. Walmart locations will be closing a bit earlier, with stores shutting their doors at 6 p.m. so employees can go home and celebrate the holiday with families. But anyone looking to make a late pick-up will still be able to do it. “Customers who order an item available for pickup on line by 6 p.m. local time on Dec. 23 will be able to pick up their items before closing time on Dec. 24,” Al.com noted.

Walgreen’s will stay open all day and night (for its 24-hour locations, at least), and some Giant-Landover stores across Maryland, Virginia, Delaware, and the District of Columbia will also be open all day on Christmas Eve and Christmas, the New York Times noted. There will be a few other stores open 24 hours on Christmas Eve, the Buffalo News noted. These include CVS, Rite Aid, and NOCO Express locations, but only those normally on 24-hour schedules. For many other stores — including most drug stores and fast food — they will be open on Christmas Eve, but the exact hours will depend on the location. As the New York Times found, shoppers are best to check ahead to see what hours the stores might be open. “That was a common response we received from large retailers: many leave holiday scheduling up to local branch managers or individual franchise owners. “CVS is also open on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, although hours will vary store to store. ‘It would be best for customers to check with their store,’ said Stephanie Cunha, a spokeswoman.” There will be plenty of other locations open on Christmas Eve 2016, including movie theaters. Those who want to know if a local store or restaurant is open or closed on Christmas Eve 2016 would be best served to call ahead early enough to find out.

See Offers Business Posted December 21, 2016 increase font size Last-minute shopping options If you haven't finished getting gifts for those on your holiday list, it's time to think outside the box. Associated Press Share Comment Read Article NEW YORK — Holiday shopping procrastinators can breathe easy. Yes, most online shipping deadlines have passed. But many retailers are offering other ways to get gifts at the last minute, whether it’s staying open through the wee hours of the night like Toys R Us, or offering Christmas Eve store pickup like Wal-Mart. Here are some options for those still scrambling to buy presents: For those still scrambling to buy presents, many stores – including Toys R Us, Kohl's, Macy's and Target – are extending their hours in the remaining days before Christmas. Associated Press/Elise Amendola Search photos available for purchase: Photo Store → MIDNIGHT RUNS Many stores are extending their hours in the days leading up to Christmas. Toys R Us will stay open from 6 a.m. Dec. 23 straight to 9 p.m. on Christmas Eve, while department store Kohl’s will stay open from Dec. 20 until Christmas Eve. Certain Macy’s department stores will be open all night between Dec. 22 and 23. Sears will close at midnight through Dec. 23 and at 6 p.m. Christmas Eve. And Target will be open from 7 a.m. to midnight through Dec. 23 and stay open until at least 10 p.m. on Christmas Eve. SHOP THE UNEXPECTED If you can’t make it to the mall, a quick stop at a drug or specialty store might work. CVS, Walgreens and Rite Aid are increasingly stocking their shelves with more toys for the little ones. And those three drugstores also have a big selection of plastic gift cards for use at other stores, such as video game retailer GameStop or bookseller Barnes & Noble. Meanwhile, office supplies store Staples sells flying drones and adult coloring books. And Dick’s Sporting Goods has Apple Watches, headphones and GoPro cameras. STORE PICKUP If you want to avoid searching for items in the store, you’re in luck. Many retailers let you buy items online and pick them up at a store the same day. After ordering and paying online, walk to a special section of the store with the confirmation email and ID and that’s it. Macy’s, Target and Best Buy are just some of the stores that offer store pickup. Wal-Mart says customers who order items before 6 p.m. Dec. 23 can pick them up on Christmas Eve and even launched a website with the items that qualify at walmart.com/lastminutegifts. And at Sears.com, those who opt for store pickup between now and Christmas Eve can get 20 percent off clothing, jewelry and home goods if they type in a special promo code. SEND AN E-GIFT The websites of some major stores are offering a way to give an instant gift, called an e-gift. It’s similar to a gift card, but is supposed to be a little more personal: You choose the item you want to buy – say sneakers or a sweater – click the “E-Gift” or “GiftNow” button, pay, and then the recipient gets an email telling him you bought him a gift. The gift receiver accepts it and can make adjustments, such as changing the color or size, before it ships. Or she can just get something else entirely from the store. The service carries no extra charges to the gift giver or receiver, and is available on several websites, including Saks Fifth Avenue, Nordstrom and Ralph Lauren.

The surveillance footage, released by the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office on Wednesday, shows Michael Foster, 43, tackling Clarence Daniels from behind as he was walking into a Brandon, Fla. Wal-Mart on Tuesday. Foster followed Daniels into the store after seeing him exiting his vehicle with a gun holstered under his shirt — which was perfectly legal for the 62-year-old Daniels to do since he holds a concealed weapon license. Nevertheless, Foster tackled Daniels from behind as he entered the store, and put him in a chokehold before taking him to the ground. Witnesses said that Foster yelled out that Daniels had a gun. They also said that Daniels yelled out that he had a license for it. Foster called 911 only after he tackled accosted Daniels. He was arrested and charged with battery.

Home Archives Ed Morrissey Show Newsletters   New York man still believes he shot and killed “Donald Trump” posted at 9:21 am on December 21, 2016 by Jazz Shaw Share on Facebook 1 1 SHARES This is one of those “local news” stories which probably wouldn’t have made it outside the confines of a couple of counties were it not for an odd twist. A UPS driver was tragically shot and killed in Ithaca, New York a couple of weeks ago, not far from where I live. In a time of rising violent crime rates this is horrible for the victim’s family, but sadly not all that unusual. The strange part came when the suspect was ready and willing to confess to the crime. He informed the police that he had no regrets because he’d done the world a great service by murdering President Elect Donald Trump. (Ithaca Voice) An Ithaca man accused of killing a UPS driver from Candor said in court Monday afternoon that not only did he believe he shot and killed Donald Trump, but that no evidence could be presented to him to suggest otherwise. Justin R. Barkley, 38, said during his arraignment and subsequent attempt to plead guilty, “I shot and killed Donald Trump purposely, intentionally and very proudly.” He told the court that he knew where president elect Donald Trump would be on Dec. 8 and waited in the Ithaca Walmart parking lot kill him. “I went there to purposely shoot and kill him and put him down,” Barkley said. So he was familiar with Donald Trump’s schedule and knew that he would be at the Walmart in Ithaca… driving a UPS truck. There are two possibilities which inevitably come to mind when you hear this story. The first is that Barkley knew precisely what he was doing and either had some animus against the driver or perhaps was looking to rob the delivery truck and the situation spiraled out of control. Then, having been caught in the act, he comes up with some wacky story to begin building an insanity defense. But the results of the initial police investigation seem to indicate that he had no idea who William Schumacher (the driver) was and the two had no shared history. Also, there’s no mention of any packages being stolen or disturbed as you might expect to find in a robbery scenario. So what about the insanity defense idea? Barkley was offered the chance to either make that case or, at a minimum, admit that he had shot Schumacher in a case of mistaken identity. No dice. The shooter told the judge that he knew precisely what he had done (that being the assassination of the President Elect) and was ready to plead guilty to it. When he was asked if there was any evidence the court might offer to prove that the victim was not Trump and that the next president was in fact still alive, Barkley indicated that there was not. The judge refused to accept his guilty plea, at least for the time being. This case has been covered on TV where I live and it may turn out to be a fairly rare instance of something being precisely what it seems. While I tend to cast a dim view on insanity defense pleas in many cases, I’m starting to think that this guy is actually insane. And I mean seriously loony tunes. If he’s that disconnected from reality, perhaps he needs a long stretch in some sort of mental institution rather than just being shipped off to jail. If we did that he’d probably think he was being sent to Mars. Either way, our thoughts and prayers go out to the Schumacher family and their friends. This was indeed a senseless, tragic murder.

Hot Topics: Latest police blotters Fall Harvest Car Show top 50 Addressing FM biz rumors Alzheimer's Walk Chat with Coroner Obits Print   Email   Font Resize Editorials Global roundtable for sustainable beef By Elisabeth Erickson-Noe Posted:   12/21/2016 07:44:34 PM MST The Global Roundtable for Sustainable Beef (GRSB) has an agenda all too familiar to U.S. ranchers. The environmental group, World Wildlife Fund (WWF aka World Wide Fund for Nature), seeks to fundamentally change the entire beef industry through the GRSB. WWF's website states that they are a founding member of the GRSB and are "actively involved in the newly established U.S. Roundtable for Sustainable Beef and Canadian Roundtable for Sustainable Beef as well as related pilot projects to develop key sustainability indicators and methods to verify sustainable beef." Their goal is to transform the beef supply chain by influencing the "companies [which] control twenty- five percent of all fifteen of the most significant commodities that threaten biodiversity" (Clay, 2010). The WWF claims beef and biofuels are two of these threatening commodities. (Clay, 2010). A 2012 WWF press release listed GRSB founding members as "AllFlex, Cargill, Elanco, Grupo de Trabalho da Pecuaria Sustentavel (GTPS), JBS, McDonald's, Merck Animal Health, National Wildlife Federation, Rainforest Alliance, Roundtable for Sustainable Beef Australia, Solidaridad, The Nature Conservancy, Walmart and World Wildlife Fund." The 2014 UN's Climate Summit Agriculture Action One-Year Report recognized McDonald's commitment to "holistically transform the entire beef value chain". In 2015, the WWF listed Cargill and McDonald's as two of their largest corporate partners. Advertisement In a 2011 BEEF Issues Quarterly interview, WWF Senior V.P. of Markets, Jason Clay stated: "We've come to a time where a farmer or rancher can't simply . . . point to their own performance and show how good they are and expect to somehow avoid the ire of people who look at the whole system." Clay classified producers at the "top" as those belonging to beef organizations. "I think NGOs and producers working together can figure out how to move the top . . . [while] government's role is probably to move the bottom . . . And that's where regulation has to come in." Clay continued, "Many people have a vested interest in beef, whether they're the customers of particular companies, whether they're civil society more broadly, whether it's researchers, government officials, NGOs. I think all of them have a role to play. But this transition won't occur in a vacuum and it won't just be shaped by ranchers. In fact the question that I would say is before us all, is will it even be mostly shaped by ranchers?" At TED Global 2010, Clay addressed whether producers should have to provide proof of sustainable production in order to sell beef to suppliers and whether sustainability is a pre-competitive issue. In 2014, Clay wrote, "Simply put, sustainability is a pre- competitive issue." (WWF, Fall 2014). In 2010, Clay said, "If sustainability is a pre- competitive issue, then we need collusion to address it." (Clay, 2010, 8:30). Collusion? Webster's Dictionary provides a single definition for collusion: a "secret agreement or cooperation especially for an illegal or deceitful purpose." Clay speculated that, "we can actually impact 40-50 percent of global [beef] production by working with a carefully selected group." (Clay, 2010). A conclusion reached after he observed the failure of the organic movement to transition all of agricultural to organic production. He felt they had relied on a group too large to adequately "inform" - 6.9 billion consumers. Clay estimated they could impact the entire beef supply chain by focusing on the smallest group, packers and retailers. "If we change those companies [that control 70 of trade for the 15 identified commodities] and the way they do business, then the rest will happen automatically." As for any companies that didn't agree to participate, they would "twist arms" and "use whatever leverage we have available to bring them to the table." (Clay, 2010). In Brazil, the Nature Conservancy (TNC) is also working towards transformation. "A victory here could ignite global change in beef production." TNC's theory involves developing a sustainable livestock plan while utilizing their "expertise in satellite imagery mapping systems to help the government monitor land use and Forest Code compliance . . . [TNC] is working with Wal-Mart in Brazil to buy meat from Marfrig, who only buys from deforestation-free ranches." (TNC, n.d.). The real threat to sustainability for American ranchers is excessive government regulation under the Endangered Species Act and the Environmental Protection Agency. Other issues impacting American ranchers and farmers are the estate tax, rising land values, urban encroachment, manipulation of the live cattle market, and lack of protection and labeling for USA-raised beef. Meanwhile, government funded NGOs operate freely, largely without accountability, with agendas aimed directly at dismantling the free enterprise of the American beef industry. Can the WWF be trusted to determine the amount of Earth's total resources or accurately predict the future? The big problem with the sustainability agenda, is the lengthy track record of failed environmental predictions. In the 1970s, environmental science claimed Earth would soon enter an ice age due to manmade global cooling, basing their models on temperatures trends. Another consensus reached through "sound" science predicted the Earth's inability to support an estimated population of 7 billion by 2000. The projected 7 billion wasn't reached until 2012 with the earth still supporting human life today. Scientists claimed mass starvation worldwide was to occur by the year 2000 with only North America, Africa and Western Europe unaffected. Additionally, natural resources like oil, nickel and copper were predicted to be depleted by the year 2000. Yet recent fracking has made it possible to access new oil reserves in shale formations. Mass extinction hasn't occurred, Earth hasn't run out of oxygen or sunlight, and acid rain hasn't fallen from the sky. The only consistency in their science, is the apocalyptic view that the Earth is doomed at the hands of man and they alone know how to save it. When their science fails, they swing the other way as is evident with the current claim of global warming. All the while, groups like the WWF ignore trends in climate, populations, and agriculture production that don't fit their agenda. They further ignore ever-advancing human innovation and ingenuity, which has elevated agriculture production to unprecedented levels. Representation of concepts related to the earth's sustainability, as undisputed scientific fact, undermines science itself. The names of industry organizations involved in these roundtables are used as endorsements to further the WWF's agenda. Through participation, organizations suggest an acceptance of the opinion that current beef production is not sustainable in some way. An opinion with which many multigenerational ranchers disagree. The sheer coexistence of nature and ranching for centuries disproves that beef is a threat to biodiversity. To the contrary, ever-improving, thriving ranches indicate that cattle are healthy contributors to the biodiversity of the environment in which they live. Despite environmental propaganda, and in the face of demeaning rhetoric questioning their intelligence, ranchers as a whole continue to be most excellent stewards of the land on which their livelihoods depend. Like many so-called "locally" and "stakeholder" driven initiatives, the GRSB and national roundtables were not created due to consumer demand, but rather by environmental organizations who seek to control what is not theirs. Clay laid out the plan at TED Global 2010, identifying the target companies, WalMart, McDonalds, JBS, Cargil, and others, then helped found the GRSB and national roundtables. Clay's complete presentation can be found on www.youtube.com or www.ted.com (video and transcript). The beef industry should not sit at any table with environmentalists who use greenwashing and collusion to get what they want. It is more pressing than ever to become well educated about the agenda of these "stakeholders" and to speak up as producers to policymakers and industry leaders about the collusion taking place in our industry. The Colorado Independent CattleGrowers Association's mission is to actively promote policy that will beneficially affect the live cattle industry at the local, state and national level, securing and preserving a viable livelihood for present and future generations. The Association shall serve to support the financial, environmental, cultural and historical interests of independent cattle producers throughout Colorado and across America.

Recently at the Team Cornwall Kool Aid drinking party a screen cap was projected with an image from a story by Veteran Journalist David Reevely of the Ottawa Citizen which referred to information that the Cornwall Sector had lost 5,000 residents during a period of time.      CITIZEN STORY LINK It’s traditional in journalism, even Gonzo journalism, to back up your facts.   CFN reached out to Mr. Reevely who responded to a few of our questions.  A call out to Councilor Towndale and the rest of council led to zero responses.  Peter Gault, President of Team Cornwall still hasn’t returned our call from last week. Then again, this newspaper, which has the highest amount of viewers in the market, and is locally owned, was not invited to the Team Cornwall AGM either.   Peter Gault and friends seem to be hypersensitive to any criticism or are too deeply up Bob Peter’s nether regions to hear their phone when it’s ringing? The youthful Towndale, who while meaning well, sometimes seems to cater to the local establishment far too deeply for someone so young, also reached out to Editor Hugo Rodrigues as the Standard Freeholder is also owned by Post Media. @JTowndale To tie this off, if he had reached out with the same data table, I wouldn’t have challenged it, given it’s CMA, not city proper — Hugo Rodrigues (@HugoAPRodrigues) December 21, 2016 Of course, this is a now a city with no public art gallery or real tourism or cultural sector.  In other words we’re losing our youth and those that are most important to a vital successful community and becoming a senior’s residence.   Bragging about saving money on community agencies is shameful and something not to be proud of.  That $45K would have kept the Art Gallery in Cornwall alive for a year. Even more oddly, sacred cow, Aultsville Theatre was moved from that envelope to Economic Development, and is now protected from the scrutiny of council directly.  Again, why is the city kicking in $100K to essentially subsidize the auditorium of St. Lawrence College?   This is again taxation without representation.    That amount of money could fund the purchase of, or help maintain a city owned facility as opposed to the weird failure and tax drain that Aultsville has been.    The same for the Woodhouse museum’s even larger budget.   The city has now apparently capped outside agency requests to $25K except for those entities.  Again, why? Community Agencies Committee has finished it’s work. $45,000 under budget. Savings to be passed along to main budget. #cwlpoli — Justin Towndale (@JTowndale) December 14, 2016   We asked Mr. Reevely four questions.  He answered all promptly, unlike all of our council which hadn’t responded as of publication time. CFN 1)   Your wrote “From 2011 to 2015, Cornwall’s population shrank by 5,000, or nearly 10 per cent. Four thousand more jobs disappeared.” How did you come up with that number?  Is that the Cornwall number or Eastern Ontario? REEVELY 1) The numbers are from Statistics Canada, based on the 2011 census and updated information from the Labour Force Survey. They’re Cornwall numbers but — importantly — they’re for the Cornwall “census agglomeration,” which includes South Stormont Township, not just the City of Cornwall. For anyone who doesn’t live in Cornwall, this is the area people think of as “Cornwall,” in the same way as the Montreal or Vancouver census areas include politically separate but obviously linked municipalities. CFN 2) Cornwall itself isn’t on Hydro One, but actually gets its power from Quebec.   We actually have some of the cheapest power in the province and we should be doing better economically because of that.  Would that info factor into your story? REEVELY 2) The point of the piece wasn’t to explore Cornwall’s economy in detail so I can’t speak to the specifics of hydro prices.   CFN 3) You touch on the losses for Cornwall, and your chart shows Eastern Ontario having he largest decline, but your story doesn’t give many specifics explaining those numbers.   Did your research show any factors or areas that could possibly lead to the negative results? REEVELY 3) I imagine Cornwall is affected by the same factors that affect lots of smaller centres: a combination of automation and cheaper imports have made it really hard for the factories and resource-processing businesses that were the mainstays of their economies to survive. We see it in the mass closures of sawmills and related industries like pulp and paper plants all over Ontario. We see it in the closure of the Hershey plant in Smiths Falls. We see it in the death of domestic textiles and clothing manufacturing. Bigger cities have done well in service industries and high-tech and culture production, but except for some pockets of advanced manufacturing like in the auto industry in southwestern Ontario, industry in rural areas has taken a beating. This is true throughout the advanced industrial economies. CFN 4)  Do you think you owe Councilor Towndale or Cornwall an apology for your story?  Do you think you erred at all? Finally, feel free to add a quote for publication summing up the reaction and your opinion. REEVELY 4) If I’d known how much the distinction between Cornwall-the-city and Cornwall-the-census-agglomeration would upset some people, I’d have made it clearer which I meant. Again, though, the piece wasn’t about Cornwall, and as written I think the worst thing you can reasonably say about it is it’s imprecise. But I used “Cornwall” the way Statistics Canada uses it.   This is incorrect @davidreevely @OttawaCitizen. Needs a #factcheck. Population has actually grown, jobs added. pic.twitter.com/zF66GTTuxy — Justin Towndale (@JTowndale) December 15, 2016 Again, when silly people do silly things like post images like that and then have Team Cornwall President go all Stepford wives as he was quoted in other media as stating: Chair of Team Cornwall Peter Gault ended the meeting by asking members of the community to help dispel rumours of a struggling Cornwall economy. Gault said stories of job losses in the community are in contrast to what Peters had shared with the audience. That silly quote is as goofy as Bob Kilger and Rick Shaver complaining about the Methodology of the Moneysense Entrepreneurial rankings which see a well deserved near bottom ranking for Cornwall yearly. It’s epic fail 101.   In this day and age we all compete to succeed and technology makes the World a smaller and faster place.  You can’t hide and just circle jerk your economy any longer with good results.   And of course it gives experienced journalists at the Citizen, and the few that might notice this silliness a giggle as they shake their heads and laugh at Cornwall, again. Mostly though it’s time to review why we simply don’t replace those that fail, like Bob Peter’s who clearly isn’t developing our Economy, with someone that might?     Giant Tiger just set up a distribution centre in Hydro One territory near Morrisburg.    Amazon just set up theirs in Quebec citing higher hydro rates in Ontario.   Yet Mr. Peters is on the home page of the Team Cornwall website and featured in its AGM.  If Mr. Peters is the best you have, or all you have, to pimp your best of year….well maybe it’s time to bring Gilles Latour back?  Think about that one for a moment….. How did Cornwall miss out on both of those distribution centers when that’s supposed to be one of our key growth sectors?  Did Mr. Peters even reach out to either company? When you have to raise water rates because you lose a factory doesn’t that truly echo what Mr. Reevely’s story was getting at, or was it simply Team Cornwall reacting to a single quote without reading a well written story?  When you’re looking at raising property taxes over 4% because your commercial real estate revenues drop is that economic growth? Could it simply be that a riding that keeps not voting with the sitting government, mixed with a backwards local economic business community, and no real cultural economy simply can’t keep up with the rest of the Province? Should we really be shooting the messengers or should we as a community take a sober look at what’s not working and come together to make the community grow?   Isn’t it time to stop celebrating failure? Or is this some feeble attempt to get some outside attention for Cornwall as the clique made a fuss over a Chez FM meme about our city recently as well?

The lawsuit filed by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), charged Wal-Mart with failing to accommodate Nancy Stack, a cancer survivor with physical limitations, and subjected her to harassment based on her disability. Stack worked at a Walmart store in Hodgkins, Ill. Wal-Mart’s alleged conduct violates the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), which prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability, which can include denying reasonable accommodations to employees with disabilities and subjecting them to a hostile work environment, the EEOC said. As a workplace accommodation, Stack needed a chair and a modified schedule. EEOC alleged that while the store provided Stack with a modified schedule for a period of time, it revoked the accommodation for no stated reason. Further, according to EEOC, the store did not ensure that a chair was in Stack’s work area, telling her that she had to haul a chair from the furniture department to her work area, a task that was difficult, given her disability. Making matters even worse, EEOC alleged that a co-worker harassed Stack by calling her “cripple” and “chemo brain.” EEOC filed suit in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division (Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.; Civil Action No. 15-cv-5796). Wal-Mart will pay $75,000 in monetary relief to Stack as part of a consent decree settling the suit. The two-year decree also provides additional, non-monetary relief intended to improve the Hodgkins store’s workplace. Under the decree, the store will train employees on disability discrimination and requests for reasonable accommodations under the ADA. The Walmart store will also monitor requests for accommodation and complaints of disability discrimination and report those to EEOC.

Advertisement A group opposed to Walmart’s expansion in Chico has filed a lawsuit challenging the City Council’s recent decision to greenlight the project. On Oct. 5, the Chico Planning Commission voted 5-2 to approve the nearly 64,500-square-foot expansion; a couple of weeks later, Brett Jolley, an attorney out of Stockton, filed an appeal on behalf of Chico Citizens for a Responsible Economy (CARE), which mounted a successful campaign against Walmart’s plans for a supercenter a decade ago. On Nov. 15, the council voted 4-3 to deny the appeal. On Thursday (Dec. 15), Jolley filed a petition for a writ of mandate, which “is necessary to remedy the city’s failure to address the project’s environmental impacts,” the document reads. The council met to discuss the litigation in closed session during its meeting on Tuesday (Dec. 20).

The surveillance footage, released by the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office on Wednesday, shows Michael Foster, 43, tackling Clarence Daniels from behind as he was walking into a Brandon, Fla. Wal-Mart on Tuesday. Foster followed Daniels into the store after seeing him exiting his vehicle with a gun holstered under his shirt — which was perfectly legal for the 62-year-old Daniels to do since he holds a concealed weapon license. Nevertheless, Foster tackled Daniels from behind as he entered the store, and put him in a chokehold before taking him to the ground. Witnesses said that Foster yelled out that Daniels had a gun. They also said that Daniels yelled out that he had a license for it. Foster called 911 only after he tackled accosted Daniels. He was arrested and charged with battery.

(WKRN) – Two people were arrested earlier this month after police allegedly found them using heroin in their vehicle with two children inside. According to an arrest affidavit, Wesley Somers, 21, and Traci Orrand, 30, were both arrested and charged with two counts of child neglect and possession of a controlled substance. Metro police said they found a 2-year-old and 8-month-old in the backseat at the Walmart on Dickerson Pike. The 2-year-old was reportedly unrestrained in the back seat. Orrand was also in the backseat of a vehicle used to buy narcotics, according to police. Officers followed the vehicle to a Walmart parking lot where officers saw Somers and one other person using heroin. Orrand allegedly admitted to using heroin and taking her children with her to buy drugs. Both were booked in the Davidson County Jail and their bond has been set at $10,000 each. Somers is also wanted for an outstanding warrant in Sumner County. Police also arrested Benjamin Scharff, 38, at the Walmart on Dickerson Pike. According to an affidavit, police found nearly 20 grams of marijuana, a half gram of heroin and a cooking spoon with him.

So on an overcast December afternoon in Rapid City, S.D., she strapped the baby into its animal-print car seat, swung by Taco John’s to pick up her paycheck, and made her way to the nearest Walmart. In the toy aisle, Shaila picked out a robotic turtle for her 4-year-old cousin, with whom she shares a room in their aunt’s single-wide trailer. Seconds after she paid the cashier, the baby began to cry, so Shaila perched the car seat on a vacant checkout counter and swapped a green diaper for a yellow one. An elderly man with long white hair approached in a motorized wheelchair. Shaila had draped a blanket to shield the baby from view. Without asking, the man used his thumb and two forefingers to peel it back for a glimpse. “They still make ’em that small!” he said, laughing, and rolled away. Shaila, who has a pretty, round face and big brown eyes that she makes look bigger with a catlike swoop of black liner, froze in a nervous half-smile. “I don’t know if he thinks I’m weird because it’s fake, or if he thinks it’s real,” she said. “I’m so confused. I don’t know what to think!” The baby was indeed a phony, made of vinyl and circuitry instead of flesh and bone. Shaila had to take it everywhere—to fill up the tank of her beat-up Mercury Cougar, to her grandfather’s house to eat dinner, to the grocery store to buy cat food—as part of a school assignment designed in part to prevent her from becoming an actual teen mom. A teen mom like her own mother was when she gave birth to Shaila at 14. A teen mom she doesn’t want to become, because she knows it could forestall her dreams of being the first in her family to go to college and eventually to law school. “I like to argue,” she’d said when I asked her the night before why she wanted to become a lawyer, her dark hair pulled high into a topknot. “And also because I want to help people.” “I think it’s pooping!” Jasmine squealed.  “Well, I think it’s fine,” Shaila said, then headed out the door Since its invention in 1992, the infant simulator that Shaila carried around has become a staple of American education, reaching more than 6 million students at 17,000 schools. It’s used in 91 countries around the world—an impressive footprint for the private, 63-person company in Eau Claire, Wis., that invented it, Realityworks, which estimates it controls 95 percent of the infant-simulator market. For educators such as Wendy Conrad, Shaila’s child development teacher at Rapid City Central High School, the appeal of the robot baby is straightforward: Once teenagers see how tough parenthood is, the last thing they’ll want to do is have unprotected sex. At $649 each, not counting software and accessories such as car seats and diaper bags, the simulators are no small purchase for schools. But purchase they do, despite a growing body of research raising doubt about their effectiveness. The latest study, the first randomized, controlled trial to test the intervention’s long-term effectiveness on pregnancy outcomes, was the most damning of all. Published in August by Australian researchers in the Lancet, a prominent British medical journal, it found that girls who cared for the electronic progeny got pregnant and gave birth at a higher rate than those who didn’t. Recognizing the threat the study posed to its babies, Realityworks came out like a mother grizzly. “I can only trust that researchers do a good job,” says Chief Executive Officer Timm Boettcher, 45. “But that doesn’t happen every time, which is why we have the term ‘junk science.’ ” In 1992 a recently unemployed rocket scientist named Rick Jurmain was sitting on a couch next to his wife, Mary, in their ranch-style home in a San Diego suburb. They were exhausted parents of a newborn baby girl and a 4-year-old boy whose colic had left them sleepless for his first 11 months. On the TV flicked a PBS show on sex education, showing teens carrying flour sacks to mimic parenthood. (Chicken eggs, with their obvious fragility, were also popular at the time.) “I remarked to Mary rather wearily and skeptically that a sack of flour doesn’t wake you up in the middle of the night,” Jurmain recalls when I call him at his new home in Vermont. “Mary responded, ‘Well, why don’t you build something that does?’ She was being flippant, but I said, ‘That’s not a bad idea.’ ” Included in the Good Business Issue of Bloomberg Businessweek, Dec. 26, 2016-Jan. 8, 2017. Subscribe now. Illustration by Caroline David Jurmain read a book to teach himself electronics and made his way to the garage, where his son helped him insert parts into circuit boards that Jurmain then soldered in a frying pan. Soon he and Mary had a prototype that they felt better simulated a newborn. They began cold-calling schools. They hired sculptors for the head and body molds; found engineers and manufacturers; and eventually tapped a family-and-consumer-science teacher from Wisconsin, where they’d moved, to develop curriculum. “My official title back then was vice president in charge of things that go beep,” Jurmain says—meaning phones, cars, the fax, and computer. Mary became CEO. They called their first product Baby Think It Over, and it exploded in popularity almost immediately. Mary was a guest on The Oprah Winfrey Show—becoming an early benefactor of the Oprah effect—and was written up in the New York Times. The product has since appeared on 90210, Project Runway, and a Jersey Shore spinoff, where Snooki and JWoww took their robot babies to a gay bar. Early models did little more than cry, and users had to insert a key into their backs to make them stop. The ninth and latest iteration, the RealCare Baby 3, is more technologically advanced. At Rapid City Central High, Conrad has 22 of them, kept when not in use inside a $5,399 storage/charging cart, all purchased, as is common, with a federal Perkins grant. (For classroom instruction, she also has Realityworks babies that mimic the effects of drug exposure ($399), premature birth ($299), and fetal alcohol syndrome ($295).) The babies weigh 7 pounds and come in seven skin tones, with “ethnic-specific facial features.” With each wail—recordings of real infants, timed to real schedules—Shaila would have two minutes to swipe a sensor-equipped bracelet over another sensor in the baby’s stomach. Then she’d have to determine what to do: feed the baby with a sensor-equipped bottle, change its sensor-equipped diaper, or simply rock it until it went back to sleep mode. Just as with a real newborn, Shaila would need to support the baby’s neck and monitor its temperature. On Monday, Conrad would download the baby’s data to assess how she did. Students often name their babies. Shaila throughout the weekend referred to hers simply as “No. 9,” after its place in Conrad’s inventory. On Saturday afternoon, I met her inside the cramped three-bedroom trailer where she lives with Rachael Wannigman, her aunt who’s been her guardian since her mom went to prison in 2010; Wannigman’s husband; her half-sister, Jasmine, 11; and her two cousins, Destiny, 8, and Xavier, 4. They were headed to their grandfather’s house nearby, and as the kids packed what they needed to spend the night into white plastic bags, Shaila readied the car seat. The vinyl body lay motionless, its facial expression poised in a state of alert, brown eyes unblinking, lips pursed for feeding. Then, from the speaker on its chest, No. 9 started to emit tiny groans. “Oh no, this isn’t good timing!” Shaila said in a panic. Wannigman smiled knowingly. “It never is.” Shaila swiped her wristband and held up the bottle. But that elicited no sucking sound, indicating that wasn’t what No. 9 wanted. “I think it’s pooping!” Jasmine squealed. Silence. “Well, I think it’s fine,” Shaila said, then headed out the door. The last Thursday in August, Boettcher was standing at his desk in his small, windowless office in Eau Claire when an e-mail arrived. A reporter sought a comment on the study about to be released by the Lancet. Boettcher knew nothing about it. But soon there were headlines around the world. The Wall Street Journal: “Robot Babies Not Effective Birth Control, Australian Study Finds.” The New York Times: “A Strategy Backfires, Increasing Teen Births.” New York magazine: “Creepy Robot Babies Don’t Deter Teens From Spawning.” The study had followed 2,834 girls age 13 to 15 at 57 schools in Perth, Australia. From 2003 to 2006, students in the intervention group cared for a Realityworks infant simulator over a weekend as part of a pregnancy prevention curriculum, while the control group received only standard health education. Researchers led by Sally Brinkman at the University of Adelaide’s School of Population Health then used medical records from hospitals and abortion clinics to track the girls until they turned 20. Empathy ‘R’ Us Realityworks says much can be taught through simulation. The company’s tag line is “Live it. Learn it.” The Pregnancy Profile, $735, simulates third-trimester burdens. The RealCare Baby 3, starting at $649, needs to be fed, have its diaper changed, and be rocked The Geriatric Simulator, $2,499, makes users feel hobbled by old age Their findings, Brinkman says, came as a surprise: Girls in the intervention group were twice as likely to give birth and one and a half times more likely to terminate a pregnancy than girls in the control group. In the Lancet, Brinkman wrote that the devices were “likely to be an ineffective use of public resources aimed at pregnancy prevention.” In Eau Claire, Boettcher and Scott Jameson, Realityworks’ vice president for sales and marketing, were beside themselves. They obtained a copy of the study to parse its every word. They held late-night conference calls to discuss strategy and contacted lawyers and a crisis public-relations firm. And they crafted a statement that fumed with indignation. “The study had nothing to do with us, our curriculum, or our RealCare Baby infant simulators, nor are its conclusions about us credible,” they wrote. They called the Australian curriculum “not even a CliffsNotes version of ours” and added, “You can’t gut the curriculum the way these authors did and expect good performance or draw any inferences whatsoever about our program.” They cited a cash “Baby Bonus” program started by the Australian government to boost birthrates, suggesting it gave the study’s intervention group, which was slightly poorer, more financial incentive to get pregnant. “What distresses us most about this study, apart from the obvious flaws, is that it confuses a vital public health issue,” they concluded. As the RealCare Baby’s use has grown, “Teen pregnancy has also declined. There are doubtless many reasons for this, and we believe one is the marked change in attitude toward teen pregnancy and parenting found in RealCare Program participants.” But Brinkman’s study wasn’t the first to question the value of baby simulators. Previous ones had focused on short-term changes in attitudes and perceptions, and their findings were mixed. Several publications said the devices had “no effect” or a “minimal” impact on students’ beliefs. “Infant simulation experiences focus on teaching teens the responsibilities of parenting, the realities of a teen pregnancy, and the personal consequences involved with early sexual behavior,” said a 2004 study in Public Health Nursing. “They do not teach teens the skills required to actually prevent a pregnancy.” One of the positive reviews, published in 2009 in the journal Health Educator, was underwritten by Realityworks. The Lancet study was the first unbiased, randomized controlled trial on the infant simulators. That kind of experiment is the gold standard in research, which added to the power of the findings. The study was also the first to look at actual outcomes over the long term: Did girls get pregnant or not? Bill Albert, chief program officer at the National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy, says this distinction between outcomes vs. intentions is crucial. Take dieting, he says: Success depends not on whether someone intends to lose weight, but on whether they actually do. “It is a reasonable thing, when taxpayer dollars are involved, to say, ‘Does this particular intervention work?’ ” he says. “Based on the research we have, the answer is no, it doesn’t work to change teen behavior. Communities should consider the Hippocratic oath here: First, do no harm.” Alison Chopel, the director of the California Adolescent Health Collaborative, has a harsher view. “The company should consider reevaluating how they market their products,” she says. “It might have other positive advantages, but if they continue to market their intervention as teen pregnancy prevention, they’re going to be defrauding their customers.” “The company should have a responsibility to the communities, schools, and students to know—not just believe—that the program works” Educators looking to fight teen pregnancy, Albert says, should consult the list of evidence-based interventions compiled by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Adolescent Health. Realityworks’ program isn’t on it. “The overwhelming majority talk about delaying both the onset of sex and the importance of contraception—not either/or, both,” says Albert. “When you look at the historic gains this country has made in reducing teen pregnancy since the early 1990s, it has been driven by this magic formula of less sex and more contraception.” Some of the more recent promising interventions include a focus on healthy relationships and a Colorado experiment offering free long-acting birth control. While the teen pregnancy rate has fallen drastically, the U.S. still battles the highest in the developed world. In 2014 some 250,000 babies were born to women age 15 to 19, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Teen pregnancy and childbirth cost U.S. taxpayers $9.4 billion in 2010. The tragedy isn’t just financial: Babies born to teens face higher rates of abuse, neglect, and incarceration, and in turn are more likely to become teen parents themselves. The potential for harm grows as robot babies proliferate into lower-income countries, where poor access to contraception and safe abortion and high rates of rape are common, says Brinkman. “Isn’t it beholden upon them,” she says of Realityworks, “to actually find out if the program works or not before selling it to the public, when it may indeed cause more harm than good? I question the ethics of implementing such programs without rigorous evaluation. For vulnerable countries and populations, I question the ethics even further. The company should have a responsibility to the communities, schools, and students to know—not just believe—that the program works.”   When I traveled to Realityworks in October, Boettcher and Jameson argued the Lancet study was flawed from the start because it measured the wrong thing. “We’re not about teen pregnancy prevention,” Jameson told me. “We’re about educating young people on the choices they make and what the outcomes are going to be like after going through that experience.” He added, “If you talk to our educators, they look at it as a parenting tool.” This seems to contradict the company’s own messaging. Under the heading “target audience” on its website, “teen pregnancy prevention” is listed first, “childcare” is second, and “parenting skills” is fourth. “Since the company’s inception,” press releases read, Realityworks has “had a vision of reducing unplanned and unwanted pregnancies.” In a blog post on its website, it directs teachers having trouble obtaining federal funding to seek grants aimed at tackling teen pregnancy. A RealCare Baby being repaired at Realityworks headquarters. Photographers: Ackerman + Gruber Boettcher and Jameson’s second argument was that long-term evidence is unnecessary because educators aren’t asking for it. They like the program, and “they believe firmly that it works,” Jameson told me. “Our educators who work with us for years are better sources for what they see occurring with individuals than a study.” But that’s anecdotal, I responded. “So it’s not valid?” Jameson said. “Don’t refute thousands of educators who’ve been using this for 20 years. All of those educators who’ve been using this firsthand and seeing it—why are we muting their voice? Why aren’t we listening to that?” I interviewed 17 educators from across the country to do just that. None used the RealCare program solely for teen pregnancy prevention, but they saw that as one of several potential benefits. Most hadn’t heard of the Lancet study or those prior, but once I gave them an overview, they brushed them aside. Jameson was right. The emerging science didn’t match educators’ experiences (even though they admitted they had no way to track actual pregnancy outcomes), and thus they dismissed its relevance to their classrooms. Not one said they’d stop using the RealCare Babies. “It’s working for me,” said Marcia Farrar, a family and consumer sciences teacher in Boise, Idaho. “I’m still going to use them.” “I don’t have a lot of time to go and spend researching,” said LaRae Rosenfeldt, a teacher in West Fargo, N.D., who uses RealCare Babies in her child development class. “Lots of parents say this has value.” I thought back to a tour Jameson had led of the Realityworks warehouse, where babies undergoing repairs before getting shipped out sit next to a giant box of plastic arms and legs destined to be recycled into lawn furniture. He pointed out a hole in the ceiling that Boettcher had made when popping the cork on a celebratory bottle of Champagne. In September, the month after the Lancet review, Realityworks’ revenue had reached a record high. Since Boettcher became CEO in 2005, Realityworks has diversified, and the RealCare Baby line now makes up only about 30 percent of sales. The company has gone further into “simulation learning,” part of the career technical-education industry—also known as CTE or simply vocational training—which is fast-growing and enjoys government funding. In 2007, Realityworks introduced a “pregnancy profile” suit that gives wearers a sense of third-trimester burdens. (I tried on the $735 apparatus during my visit. Hard plastic balls dug into my ribs to mimic fetal limbs. A warm weight pressed on my bladder, making me have to pee. And when I bent over to pick up a pen from the floor, the 30-pound belly almost tipped me over.) Realityworks has since released products to teach welding, culinary safety, and the debilities of old age; it’s exploring ways to enter the medical-education market. “Profitability alone does not define our success,” reads the company’s mission on a sign greeting visitors in the office lobby. “We measure our impact by how many lives are changed in positive ways, and how profoundly they are changed, as a result of our efforts.” Left to right: Realityworks’ Mary Stenvig, CFO; CEO Boettcher; and sales and marketing VP Jameson in Eau Claire, Wis. Photographers: Ackerman + Gruber In South Dakota, Shaila had enrolled in Conrad’s elective class in part because babies are “fun” and “cute,” she said. But as her weekend with No. 9 wore on, the excitement wore off. As the oldest of her generation within her family, she’d taken care of her half-sister and younger cousins plenty—even overnight, as the sole provider. No. 9, she decided, was easier. “You don’t have to pay as much attention to it, and you don’t have to hold it,” she said. “I think a real baby would be awake more, and you’d have to interact with it more. And if it was real, I wouldn’t let it sleep in my bed with me.” Shaila told me she doesn’t plan to start having sex anytime soon and pegged her late 20s as the ideal age to begin motherhood. But she’d felt that way before the robot baby came into her life—and doubted that caring for one would change anyone’s mind. On her classroom door, Conrad had hung a Realityworks poster listing the drawbacks of teen pregnancy. Inside, she told me that while the vast majority of her students can’t wait to be done caring for the baby, some do return the following semester pregnant. “I just can’t believe it after all the things I’ve talked to them about in my class,” including contraception, she said. The Lancet study “doesn’t make me want to stop using the babies, like they’re worthless now,” she said. “Because I do feel like even if it’s not preventing that particular thing, it still helps me cover a lot of the standards of the curriculum. It does make me think about how I want to present it to my kids, though.” Students had returned the babies that morning. “I don’t think I want kids!” a girl named Kassidy said in a huff. A cheerleader named Rachel, who was redoing the assignment for extra credit, said her second time with a robot baby was harder, but overall, not bad. Shaila came in with a friend and placed No. 9 on a shelf. It was early, and she was tired and quiet. She held out her wrist for Conrad to snip off the sensor bracelet. She was free.   Terms of Service Trademarks Privacy Policy ©2017 Bloomberg L.P. All Rights Reserved Careers Made in NYC Advertise Ad Choices Website Feedback Help

It wasn't the look of the vehicle that caught his attention but the smell emanating from it — an odor "similar to that of homeless camps," he said. Related News/Archive Police: Package stolen from doorstep of Hulk Hogan's Clearwater Beach mansion (w/video) 3 Weeks Ago Video of fatal shooting shows Chicago officers firing at car (w/video) 5 Months Ago Black Lives Matter activists stage protests across Britain (w/video) 5 Months Ago Inside, the deputy found a family of seven. The parents seemed healthy, he said, but their five children, ranging in age from 4 to 14, were filthy, fatigued and so malnourished that their bones were protruding from under their skin, according to WPTV-TV in West Palm Beach. The oldest reportedly weighed a mere 50 pounds, just 5 pounds more than his 8-year-old sibling. The parents, Donell Barron and Rikki Hart, both 34, were arrested Saturday on charges of child neglect. As of Wednesday evening, they were being held in the Palm Beach County Jail in lieu of $1,000 bail, the Palm Beach Post reported. It was not clear Wednesday if they had hired defense attorneys. The Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office told local media that the children, all of whom were described as "underweight," were taken to a hospital, where at least one of them was treated for unusually high blood pressure. The five kids are now in custody of the Florida Department of Children and Families, the Palm Beach Post reported. Police said they took some of the children out to eat at McDonald's, where they "ravenously ate the meals, as if they had not been fed in quite some time." When interviewed by the sheriff's office, Barron gave a grim account of how the family wound up living out of their car. According to the Palm Beach Post, Barron told police that they had were evicted from their home in Port St. Lucie about a year ago and had spent about 10 months hopping from one hotel to another before they ran out of money. They had lived in the car for the past two months, he told police, adding that the children bathed in park bathrooms and urinated in a bucket they carried in the vehicle. Deputies reported that the children ate about once a day, their meals consisting mostly of salad and bread, and hadn't seen a doctor in years, according to the Palm Beach Post. None of the children were enrolled in school, and instead were home-schooled inside the car, Barron told police. At times, Barron gave contradictory statements to police. First, he told deputies that he attended "three years of law school and practices law, but not as a lawyer," according to a police report reviewed by WPTV. Later, he said he lost his money trading stocks and had never attended law school. He described himself as a Native American with a "corporate name" and said he was "not the property of the U.S. or any corporation," the Palm Beach Post reported. Police told local media that Barron and Hart appeared to be clean and in better health than the children. Richard Hart and Robin Johnson, identified by WPTV as Hart's parents and the grandparents of the five children, told the station they had fallen out of touch with their daughter and didn't know how the family ended up in such a wretched state. They said she was once a homecoming queen and attended college on an academic scholarship. "Here I am sleeping in a comfortable bed and my babies had to be sleeping in a car all crammed up like that," Richard Hart said. "She was a very loving parent. She was a very doting parent. She took care of her children. How we get to this point, that's a question we can't answer." The Palm Beach Post reported that the couple ran a blog called "Holistically Beautiful" that they launched in 2014. The blog's "about" page says Donell and Rikki Barron created the site "to show the benefits of living a healthier lifestyle and discuss topics which can enrich one's life." "They believe in the importance of living a balanced life and the importance of constantly improving oneself," it says. A call to the number listed on the site went to a disconnected line and an email to the blog wasn't immediately returned. Donell Barron and Rikki Hart, both 34, were arrested on child neglect charges.

Matthew Mills posted a photo to Facebook Sunday that shows a car straddling two parking spaces at the Walmart store in Biddeford. "This guy got a lesson in parking," Mills wrote. Mills said the bad parking job was made all the more egregious by the fact that the car was taking up two handicapped spots and didn't have a placard. Mills said the word on the street was that the inconsiderate driver was actually an employee at the store. "I was told it was an employee," Mills told KTRK-TV. "It was icy and they [allegedly] slid into the spot this way and later found the carts arranged around their car.

Any hopes of the Dow hitting 20,000 before next week have likely been dashed. Shares of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE: WMT) were the biggest drag on the index and fell roughly 2.5%. The Nasdaq was pulled down by a shaky performance in the technology sector. Shares of Apple Inc. (Nasdaq: AAPL) dipped nearly 1% after the company was named the defendant in several patent infringement lawsuits filed by hardware rival Nokia. Meanwhile, shares of Amazon.com Inc. (Nasdaq: AMZN) fell more than 0.4%. Despite the downturn, it was a positive day for economic data in the United States. The nation saw an uptick in new capital goods orders, while third-quarter GDP was revised upward to 3.5%. The third-quarter figure represents the fastest quarterly growth in roughly two years and sets the tone for increased optimism for the U.S. economy heading into 2017. Let's look at the numbers from Thursday for the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq: Dow Jones: 19,918.88; -23.08; -0.12% S&P 500: 2,260.96; -4.22; -0.19% Nasdaq: 5,447.42; -24.01; -0.44% Now, here's a look at today's most important market events and stocks, plus a preview of Friday's economic calendar. DJIA Today: Dow Slides Despite Q3 GDP Bump; China Trade Deals in Focus The Dow Jones slipped 23 points on Thursday as consumer stocks dipped thanks to a round of lackluster earnings reports. Markets were slightly rattled today after President-elect Donald Trump announced that he has nominated Peter Navarro to head the White House National Trade Council. Navarro is a professor of economics and public policy in the Paul Merage School of Business at the University of California, Irvine. He is also an outspoken critic of China's trade policies and author of a book on the country's impact on the U.S. economy called "Death by China." Don't Miss: How to Make a Killing… When Everyone Else Is Panicking The decision is seen as an effort by Trump to double-down on the hard talk about China's currency devaluation, its growing trade balance against the United States, and its shaky trade relationship with the country. Some are worried that Trump's policies – which include proposals for tariffs on Chinese goods — could spark a trade war between the world's two largest economies. Crude oil prices were ticking higher despite a report on Wednesday by the Energy Information Administration stating that U.S. crude inventories increased last week. The WTI crude oil price today added 0.3%, while Brent crude added 0.7%. The combination of positive economic data and increased optimism that OPEC members will honor their production deal pushed crude higher. Money Morning Global Energy Strategist Dr. Kent Moors argues that powerful forces are manipulating the global oil markets. And he's identified one company that is poised to profit from this ongoing conspiracy. But the big story today is what is happening in the mainstream financial media. Right now, all the major news sites are compiling their annual forecasts for 2017. But we've discovered something very disturbing about stories like the one in Barron's that offers 2017 stock market forecasts. You see, in too many cases, these predictions are no better than throwing a dart at a dartboard with a blindfold. Even worse, when they're wrong, there is little accountability to the people who took this so-called "expert" advice from Wall Street sell-side analysts. We've put together a report on the futility of sell-side forecasts on Wall Street and made a shocking discovery. More important, Money Morning Chief Investment Strategist Keith Fitz-Gerald has devised a strategy to help you cut through all the noise and profit in 2017. Check it out, right here. Top Stock Market News Today, Dec. 22, 2016 Shares of Weight Watchers International Inc. (NYSE: WTW) added more than 11% after Oprah Winfrey announced a new campaign about the 40 pounds of weight she lost since starting her dietary program. Winfrey is a board member of the company and owns roughly 10% of the enterprise. It's a big pop for the stock, which is still off more than 50% from its 52-week high. In deal news, it looks like McDonald's Corp. (NYSE: MCD) is set to finalize its departure from the Chinese and Hong Kong markets by selling its stores to a private-equity group led by Citigroup. The deal is expected to return roughly $3 billion. In earnings news, shares of ConAgra Foods Inc. (NYSE: CAG) added nearly 3% after the company topped Wall Street profit expectations. Meanwhile, shares of Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. (Nasdaq: BBBY) cratered nearly 10% after the firm's third-quarter earnings report fell well below Wall Street's expectations. The company was among the top three stocks to watch today, including Micron Technology Inc. (Nasdaq: MU) and Rite Aid Corp. (NYSE: RAD). Here's more on today's top stocks to watch. After the bell, look for additional reports from Cal-Maine Foods Inc. (Nasdaq: CALM) and Cintas Corp. (Nasdaq: CTAS). Friday's U.S. Economic Calendar (all times EST) New Home Sales at 10 a.m. Consumer Sentiment at 10 a.m. Baker Hughes Rig Count at 1 p.m. Bond Market Close: 2 p.m. An $80 Billion Cover-Up? Feds use obscure loophole to threaten retirees… Under the watchful eye of Congress, the government will soon be implementing a controversial plan that threatens the retirement of millions of Americans. And they're using an obscure loophole buried in Title 29 of the U.S. Labor Code to do it. If you have a 401(k), IRA, or any type of retirement account, this could cause you to miss out on $68,870 or more. Full Story Follow Money Morning on Facebook and Twitter Join the conversation.

Claiming to be concerned about the “racial divide” our country is currently experiencing they have encouraged Walmart to cease and desist the sale of ‘Bulletproof: Black Lives Matter’ T-shirts. But Walmart is like…not so fast. Though the retail giant has agreed to stop selling the Bulletproof merchandise, it will continue to sell other Black Lives Matter items; along with Blue Lives Matter and All Lives Matter merchandise. They ain’t stupid. The merchandise is making too much money to just stop selling. The initial upset came on Tuesday, when Chuck Canterbury, president of the Fraternal Order of Police sent a letter to Wal-Mart CEO Douglas McMillon and encouraged him to stop selling Black Lives Matter and Bulletproof t-shirts. The merchandise is currently being sold on the company website by way of third party vendors. The correspondence read… “I am writing on behalf of the membership of the Fraternal Order of Police to advise you that third-party sellers are using your website to sell offensive shirts and sweatshirts with the slogans “BULLETPROOF” and “Black Lives Matter.” Read more at EURThisNthat.   Share this: Tweet Print More Email Share on Tumblr BLMFraternity of Police threatens WalmartWalmart stops selling Bulletproof BLM Previous ArticleOprah Winfrey Says She's Lost 40 Pounds & Still Eats Bread in New Weight Watchers Ad (Video) Next ArticleFormer ’16 and Pregnant’ Star Valerie Fairman Dies at 23 Show/Hide Comments Speak your Mind Cancel reply Follow Us Recent Videos Top Views Condola Rashad: Phylicia Rashad’s Daughter Engaged to Fellow Actor January 6, 2017 Lamar Odom Considering Reality TV Comeback, Watch Video Of Brawl At Ricky Harris’ Funeral January 6, 2017 Serial Killer Charles Manson No Model Prisoner During Decades in Jail January 6, 2017 Ciara Drops $15M Defamation Lawsuit Against Ex Future January 6, 2017 Jeanette J.

Schaefer Arrow icon A Boothwyn man who got lost on a trip to Walmart and ended up 900 miles away in Alabama is home safe in what family members are calling a "Christmas miracle." Jody Tarbutton, 89, left home on Dec. 17 in his 2010 silver Toyota Tacoma and headed out to pick up electrical supplies, according to a story on WVTM13-TV. Tarbutton, who has dementia, took a wrong turn in the bad weather and kept driving, hoping to find his way home.  When relatives couldn't find him, they contacted police, filed a missing persons report and blanketed social media with his photo. "HELP!!! My grandfather Jody Tarbutton has not been seen since yesterday at noon in Boothwyn, PA. He is 89 and suffers from dementia. Please say a prayer and keep your eye out for him. He's in a 2010 silver Toyota Tacoma. Thank you," Traci Porter Raftowich posted on Facebook. Tarbutton eventually realized he needed help and approached two Haleyville, Ala., police officers eating in a restaurant and told them he was lost. Once the officers saw the Pennsylvania driver's license, they contacted the elderly man's family. "Man said I drove 900 miles and I don't remember," Tarbutton told the station. "Christmas miracle. ... our Dad has been located safe and alive in Alabama," Cindy Gatta posted on Facebook just before boarding a plane Tuesday to get her father. She thanked police and the media for their help in locating her missing father.  Tarbutton's truck will be towed back with the help of Alabamians, according to the story.

(Photo: Hyosub Shin, AP) NEW YORK — Holiday shopping procrastinators can breathe easy. Yes, most online shipping deadlines have passed. But many retailers are offering other ways to get gifts at the last minute, whether it's staying open through the wee hours of the night like Toys R Us, or offering Christmas Eve store pickup like Wal-Mart. Here are some options for those still scrambling to buy presents: MIDNIGHT RUNS Many stores are extending their hours in the days leading up to Christmas. Toys R Us will stay open from 6 a.m. on Dec. 23 straight to 9 p.m. on Christmas Eve, while department store Kohl's will stay open from Dec. 20 until Christmas Eve. Certain Macy's department stores will be open all night between Dec. 22 and Dec. 23. Sears will close at midnight through Dec. 23 and close at 6 p.m. on Christmas Eve. And Target will be open from 7 a.m. to midnight through Dec. 23 and stay open until at least 10 p.m. on Christmas Eve. SHOP THE UNEXPECTED USA TODAY Last minute holiday deals: What to buy now and what to wait for If you can't make it to the mall, a quick stop at a drug or specialty store might work. CVS, Walgreens and Rite Aid are increasingly stocking their shelves with more toys for the little ones. And those three drugstores also have a big selection of plastic gift cards for use at other stores, such as video game retailer GameStop or bookseller Barnes & Noble. Meanwhile, office supplies store Staples sells flying drones and adult coloring books. And Dick's Sporting Goods has Apple Watches, headphones and GoPro cameras. STORE PICKUP If you want to avoid searching for items in the store, you're in luck. Many retailers let you buy items online and pick them up at a store the same day. After ordering and paying online, walk to a special section of the store with the confirmation email and ID and that's it. Macy's, Target and Best Buy are just some of the stores that offer store pickup. Wal-Mart says customers who order items before 6 p.m. on Dec. 23 can pick them up on Christmas Eve and even launched a website with the items that qualify at walmart.com/lastminutegifts. And at Sears.com, those who opt for store pickup between now and Christmas Eve can get 20 percent off clothing, jewelry and home goods if they type in a special promo code. SEND AN E-GIFT The websites of some major stores are offering a way to give an instant gift, called an e-gift. It's similar to a gift card, but is supposed to be a little more personal: You choose the item you want to buy — say sneakers or a sweater — click the "E-Gift" or "GiftNow" button, pay, and then the recipient gets an email telling them you bought them a gift. The gift receiver accepts it and can make adjustments, such as changing the color or size, before it ships. Or they can just get something else entirely from the store. The service carries no extra charges to the gift giver or receiver, and is available on several websites, including Saks Fifth Avenue, Nordstrom and Ralph Lauren. SAME-DAY DELIVERY It will cost you more, but if you're desperate, you can get some items delivered the same day you order them online. Macy's offers same-day delivery in some cities and so does Nordstrom. But be aware, some may not deliver on Christmas Eve, like Nordstrom. If you're an Amazon.com Prime member paying the annual fee, the online retailer is lets shoppers in Miami, New York and other cities order toys, electronics and other gifts as late as 9:45 p.m. on Christmas Eve for delivery in two hours, meaning you'll get it before midnight. OR JUST WAIT Procrastination may work in your favor if you end up not seeing a person you're shopping for until after Christmas. That's when after-holiday sales kick in, says Sara Skirboll, a shopping and trends expert at shopping deal app RetailMeNot. If the timing works, you'll likely pay less for a gift than you would if you had bought it before the holidays, says Skirboll.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple Last-minute NES Classic stock is hitting one more store Chris Mills BGR NewsDecember 22, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share You’ve probably abandoned all hope of getting a NES Classic Edition before Christmas, and just accepted that you’re going to be wrapping a $60 gift card under the tree instead. But with 2.5 shopping days left until Christmas, there is still hope. Don't Miss: The best TV shows on Netflix you’ve never heard of Meijer has made a last-moment entry into the fiercely competitive NES Classic Edition race, announcing on Twitter that limited stock of the NES Classic is available in some Meijer stores today. This might actually be a good opportunity to grab the console: while everyone else is focused on Target, Amazon and Walmart, Meijer is flying under the radar of most NES Classic hunters. Limited quantities of this season's hot NES Classic available tomorrow morning. Visit @Meijer stores for details! — Meijer PR (@MeijerPR) December 21, 2016 Meijer confirmed that the consoles were in stock as of 8AM this morning, so you’ll want to be fast. For anyone on the West Coast, the day is still young, so you’ve got a better shot than people in the East. As always, your best bet is to call your local store and see what the word is on availability. It’s worth trying, because while stock has still been coming in intermittently to Walmart and Target stores, overnight lines are snapping up consoles a lot faster than they come in. Amazon Prime Now cities are also getting occasional stock, and that’s definitely worth keeping an eye on over the next couple days. Amazon has been announcing stock in a timely fashion through its Twitter feed, so I’d recommend setting up a custom notification or text alert for Amazon tweets, so you can beat the masses to it. Otherwise, Target has proven to be the most fruitful of the local stores. If you see stock come in overnight, it’s time to grab a good book, head over to the store, and wait in line until opening. A lot of stores are using a ticketing system so that you don’t have to physically wait in line all night, but it’s worth contacting your local store to see exactly how they’re distributing stock as it comes in. GameStop has also seen stock coming in, and the company confirmed earlier that shipments are arriving today. If you’ve got a local store, it’s worth calling or heading over to chat to the employees, who may reveal when the trucks are arriving. If all this sounds like a lot of hassle to you, there are alternatives. The market for secondary sales is exploding at the moment. eBay is the obvious place to pick up a console, with prices currently running around $200 for the console, plus up to $50 for overnight shipping. That’s obviously a lot more than the $60 you’ll pay at Target, but then again, this is Christmas. Craigslist prices seem to be a little lower, but you’re also running a greater risk meeting with someone in person.

Don’t be fooled, though: these aren’t the NES Classics you’re looking for. Instead, they’re listings from third-party sellers, not Walmart itself, and the price has been suitably gouged as a result. In fact, if you were to buy from Walmart.com right now, you’d pay a whopping $259.99. That’s more than four times the standard retail price of $60 for the NES Classic. At that point, you’d be better off buying one from eBay, where most of the listings don’t even come close to $260. As cool as the NES Classic Edition is, it isn’t worth that much. So what other options do you have? Luckily, there are a couple of retailers that have announced returning stock. If you’re in the midwest (meaning, in this case, Michigan, Illinois, Ohio, Indiana, or Kentucky), it may be worth checking with your local Meijer. The grocery store chain announced over Twitter that it will have limited quantities in stock beginning today. Today is also the last day that GameStop expects the NES Classic Edition to be in stock. Again, quantities are limited, and you’ll have to go to a store to stand any chance at picking one up. GameStop says this batch of NES Classics isn’t available online, so that means braving the flood of last-minute shoppers to potentially get one. Hopefully the NES Classic Edition is more readily available once the holiday shopping season has come to a close. It’s proven to be one of the hottest items of the year, and it’s been nearly impossible to find since launching on November 11. Let’s just hope we don’t see a repeat of Wii-level stock shortages moving forward. Story Timeline NES Classic Edition returns to Best Buy December 20, but for how long?

(Photo by Leah Wankum/Richmond News) By Leah Wankum, Editor The children who participated in Shop with a Sheriff in Richmond already think that giving is more important than receiving. The Ray County deputies wanted to show the importance of giving through their first Shop with a Sheriff program this Christmas, but it turned out that the local children were already well acquainted with that attitude. Sheriff Garry Bush and his deputies invited seven underprivileged families Tuesday to shop with them at Walmart in Richmond, and provided 19 children with $150 each so they could purchase Christmas gifts for their loved ones. Two of the families live in Richmond, while the other five families live in Orrick, Hardin, Henrietta, Lawson and Camden. Deputy Jeff Perkins, who worked with Sgt. David Benham to coordinate the program, said he saw a lot of thoughtful gift-giving throughout the evening, including one boy who wanted to make sure his sister could get her ears pierced for free at Walmart if he bought her first pair of earrings. “The biggest highlight that I saw was the majority of the kids focused on their families or other people instead of wanting to buy something for themselves,” Perkins said. “That makes me feel good because part of this program was to try to instill some values that it’s better to give, and a lot of them I didn’t even have to tell them twice. They didn’t even second-guess it. They went right into wanting to give everybody else something.” The picking and choosing happened in a flurry of excitement, as the children took their carts and deputies up and down the aisles in search of the best gifts for their loved ones. “It’s a little overwhelming, but it’s neat,” said Rose Shepard of Hardin. “There’s just a lot going on, a lot to process.” Rose and Jared Shepard’s house in Hardin caught on fire a few weeks ago, and the local community has been providing their family with food, clothes, household items, toys and other amenities. Including the Shepard family in the Shop with a Sheriff program was just one of many local efforts to help the family while they recover from the loss. “It’s a good thing,” Rose Shepard said. “We just appreciate it.” You must be logged in to post a comment Login   Archives Archives Select Month January 2017 December 2016 November 2016 October 2016 September 2016 August 2016 July 2016 June 2016 May 2016 April 2016 March 2016 February 2016 January 2016 December 2015 November 2015 October 2015 September 2015 August 2015 July 2015 June 2015 May 2015 April 2015 March 2015 February 2015 January 2015 December 2014 November 2014 October 2014 September 2014 August 2014 July 2014 June 2014 May 2014 April 2014 March 2014 February 2014 January 2014 December 2013 November 2013 October 2013 September 2013 August 2013 July 2013 June 2013 May 2013 April 2013 March 2013 February 2013 January 2013 December 2012 November 2012 October 2012 September 2012 August 2012 July 2012 June 2012 May 2012 April 2012 March 2012 February 2012 January 2012 December 2011 November 2011 October 2011 September 2011 August 2011 July 2011 June 2011 May 2011 April 2011 March 2011 February 2011 January 2011 December 2010 November 2010 October 2010 September 2010 August 2010 July 2010 June 2010 May 2010 April 2010 March 2010 February 2010 January 2010 December 2009 November 2009 October 2009 September 2009 August 2009 July 2009 June 2009 May 2009 April 2009 March 2009 February 2009 January 2009 December 2008 November 2008 October 2008 September 2008 August 2008 July 2008 June 2008 May 2008 April 2008 March 2008 February 2008 January 2008 December 2007 November 2007 October 2007 September 2007 August 2007 July 2007 June 2007 May 2007 April 2007 Home Contact Us Community Calendar Legal Notices Classifieds Submit Your News City of Richmond Advertise with us © 2016, ↑ Richmond Daily News Log in- Posts - Add New -
Skip to navigation Skip to content Skip to sidebar News World More Five malnourished children with bones protruding under their skin found living in car with healthy parents Derek Hawkins, Washington Post  12.22.2016 ShareAdjustCommentPrint The deputy said he was on a routine patrol in Greenacres, Fla., Saturday morning when he spotted the blue Toyota in a Wal-Mart parking lot. It wasn’t the look of the vehicle that caught his attention but the smell emanating from it – an odor “similar to that of homeless camps,” he said. Inside, the deputy found a family of seven. The parents seemed healthy, he said, but their five children, ranging in age from 4 to 14, were filthy, fatigued and so malnourished that their bones were protruding from under their skin, according to WPTV. The oldest reportedly weighed a mere 50 pounds, just 5 pounds more than his 8-year-old sibling. The parents, Donell Barron and Rikki Hart, both 34, were arrested Saturday on charges of child neglect, according to WPTV. As of Wednesday evening, they were being held in the Palm Beach County Jail in lieu of $1,000 bail, the Palm Beach Post reported. It was not clear Wednesday if they had hired defense attorneys. Police said they took some of the children out to eat at McDonald’s, where they “ravenously ate the meals, as if they had not been fed in quite some time.” The Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office told local media that the children, all of whom were described as “underweight,” were taken to a hospital, where at least one of them was treated for unusually high blood pressure. The five kids are now in custody of the Florida Department of Children and Families, the Palm Beach Post reported. Police said they took some of the children out to eat at McDonald’s, where they “ravenously ate the meals, as if they had not been fed in quite some time.” When interviewed by the sheriff’s office, Barron gave a grim account of how the family wound up living out of their car. According to the Palm Beach Post, Barron told police that they had were evicted from their home in Port St. Lucie about a year ago and had spent about 10 months hopping from one hotel to another before they ran out of money. They had lived in the car for the past two months, he told police, adding that the children bathed in park bathrooms and urinated in a bucket they carried in the vehicle. Deputies reported that the children ate about once a day, their meals consisting mostly of salad and bread, and hadn’t seen a doctor in years, according to the Palm Beach Post. None of the children were enrolled in school, and instead were home-schooled inside the car, Barron told police. At times, Barron gave contradictory statements to police. First, he told deputies that he attended “three years of law school and practices law, but not as a lawyer,” according to a police report reviewed by WPTV. Later, he said he lost his money trading stocks and had never attended law school. He described himself as a Native American with a “corporate name” and said he was “not the property of the U.S. or any corporation,” the Palm Beach Post reported. Here I am sleeping in a comfortable bed and my babies had to be sleeping in a car all crammed up like that. Police told local media that Barron and Hart appeared to be clean and in better health than the children. Richard Hart and Robin Johnson, identified by WPTV as Hart’s parents and the grandparents of the five children, told the station they had fallen out of touch with their daughter and didn’t know how the family ended up in such a wretched state. They said she was once a homecoming queen and attended college on an academic scholarship. “Here I am sleeping in a comfortable bed and my babies had to be sleeping in a car all crammed up like that,” Richard Hart said. “She was a very loving parent. She was a very doting parent. She took care of her children. How we get to this point, that’s a question we can’t answer.” The Palm Beach Post reported that the couple ran a blog called “Holistically Beautiful” that they launched in 2014. The blog’s “about” page says Donell and Rikki created the site “to show the benefits of living a healthier lifestyle and discuss topics which can enrich one’s life.” “They believe in the importance of living a balanced life and the importance of constantly improving oneself,” it says. A call to the number listed on the site went to a disconnected line and an email to the blog wasn’t immediately returned.

By JEN CARDINES STAFF WRITER Sen. Joe Markley, State Rep. Rob Sampson and Rep.-elect John Fusco braved the cold weather on Thursday, Dec. 15 to collect money for the Salvation Army. In below freezing temperatures, Southington’s political figures “rang the bell” from 3 p.m. to 5 p.m. at the Queen Street Walmart to benefit town residents in need. Every year, Markley and Sampson make an appearance in the Christmas season to raise funds. This is the sixth year Markley and Sampson have rung the bell for charity and the first year Fusco will join them. State Rep. Rob Sampson (R-Wolcott, Southington) jokes with a Walmart customer as she donates to the Salvation Army. Southington’s elected officials gathered to ring the bell for charity last Thursday. Sampson said they’ve produced record amounts over the past five years because Wal-Mart matches the donations received in those two hours 100 percent.  Markley added that they raised $12,000 in the first year. “They thought we’d never do it again, but we did, and then we went over that,” Markley said.  Through this annual event, Wal-Mart has donated more than $100,000 over the years. Southington UNICO presented a check for $1,875. “We donated $1,500 and Liberty Bank added $375,” said UNICO board member and State Rep. Dave Zoni, who lost his seat to Fusco in the November election. “Now Wal-Mart is going to double it.” With a beaming smile, UNICO President Victoria Triano said, “We did this because we knew they’d match it dollar for dollar.  Our members worked so hard to make this possible and we are so happy that the senator and representatives are here to receive it.” All of the money collected in the Salvation Army buckets in Southington stays in Southington, through Community Services.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on: Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink: Purchase: Order Reprint As the top of an hour approached, about 15 drivers began filing into Amazon's Prime Now hub in Minneapolis. The first eight lined up, then the others, as black carts with sealed brown bags were wheeled out to each of them. The drivers, some of whom had left their cars running outside to keep them warm and get a head start on the one- to two-hour delivery window, scanned the bar codes on each package and then were off to courier them to various corners of the Twin Cities on Thursday morning. This warehouse in an industrial area of southeast Minneapolis has been hopping since Amazon first opened it in October 2015. In fact, it has become so busy that the Twin Cities is now one of Amazon's top markets for Prime Now, its two-hour delivery service in more than 30 cities, a company spokeswoman confirmed. The hub will be buzzing right up until the last hour of the holiday shopping season. While it usually ends deliveries at 10 p.m., Amazon has extended its hours until midnight on Friday night and Christmas Eve for last-minute purchases. "We expect to be pretty busy," said Amazon spokeswoman Leah Bibbo. "You can imagine while people are wrapping gifts, you discover that a toy you bought needs batteries. Or maybe you have people over for the evening and you run out of eggnog." The deadlines for free delivery of online orders for most other retailers has already passed. So the best option for last-minute shopping at those establishments is heading out to the stores in person. While many shopping centers have extended hours this week in the final sprint to Christmas and Hanukkah, retailers are taking different approaches to their hours on Christmas Eve, which falls on a Saturday this year. Minneapolis-based Target Corp. will keep its stores open until 10 p.m. or 11 p.m. for last-minute procrastinators that night, with a 6 p.m. deadline for placing online orders that can be picked up later in stores on Christmas Eve. Richfield-based Best Buy will close at 6 p.m., the same time as it did last year, with a 4 p.m. deadline for online orders to be picked up in stores. Wal-Mart, which stays open all day on Thanksgiving, also will close at 6 p.m. on Christmas Eve, two hours earlier than last year. "Our associates work hard all year to make this holiday season special for our customers, and we truly appreciate what they do every day," Judith McKenna, Wal-Mart's chief operating officer, said in a statement. "We also know that getting home on Christmas Eve to spend time with families is important. That's why this year we'll be closing at 6 p.m. on Christmas Eve." In the last year or so, Amazon, which has been siphoning away customers from brick-and-mortar retailers, has been aggressively expanding its operations around the Twin Cities. Over the summer, it opened a sprawling, newly built fulfillment center in Shakopee where it has hired 1,500 employees and is already looking to recruit another 1,000 workers. In recent weeks, Amazon quietly launched free same-day delivery in the Twin Cities to members of its $99-a-year Prime membership program, which already promises free two-day delivery on many items nationwide. More than a million items are available for free same-day delivery through Amazon seven days a week on orders of at least $35. On top of that, a smaller assortment — still tens of thousands of items — are available to Prime members for free delivery within two hours through the Prime Now app with a $20 purchase. Customers also can pay an extra fee of $7.99 to get deliveries within an hour. Amazon has also added other perks to the Prime Now service such as restaurant and alcohol delivery in the Twin Cities. The one- to two-hour Prime Now orders are fulfilled through the 40,000-square-foot hub on Kasota Avenue in Minneapolis. Amazon contracts with drivers who use their own cars to deliver the packages, similar to how Uber and Lyft work. "We have staffed up significantly for the holidays to make sure we can deliver orders to our customers," Bibbo said. But she declined to say how many drivers Amazon is working with in the Twin Cities. Last year during the holidays, she said the Amazon Echo, Fire tablets, HDMI cables and pressure cookers were some of the top sellers on Prime Now locally. Throughout the year, other items such as bananas, sparkling water, eggs and Gummy Bears are usually the most popular items, she said. "At the beginning of December, popular items were things like toys and games for a family to play over the holidays," she said. "And then this week, the last week before Christmas, it's a lot more last-minute items, so party supplies, wrapping paper, host and hostess gifts as well and electronics." In the Prime Now hub, a group of employees stand around computer screens monitoring orders. When a one-hour delivery order comes in, they call it out and a worker puts the items on a special cart with red and white tape on it to set it apart from other orders and get it out the door more quickly. Workers carry handheld devices that tell them where to locate various items. They push around carts with empty brown paper bags, filling them with items they pick from the shelves. In one corner, there are several racks of bananas with signs reminding the pickers not to select ones that have any brown spots on them. There's also a freezer section with a large selection of frozen pizza and other items that are placed in cold-pack bags. In the back, there's an area for larger items such as 12-pack cartons of Diet Coke, Mountain Dew and La Croix water as well as other items that don't fit into bags such as TVs, printers and small appliances. As they wait for their turn to make a delivery, drivers wait in the lobby where there's a TV and some tables and chairs. On the wall that separates the waiting room from the warehouse, it says in large letters: "Work Hard. Have Fun. Make History." kavita.kumar@startribune.com kavitakumar View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive, mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

This is because U.K. supermarkets are much further along the curve of both e-commerce and the combined impacts of Aldi and Lidl, the two German limited assortment store retailers. The latter now hold market shares in the U.K. of 6.1% and 4.6%, respectively: almost 11% combined, versus under 3% for the limited assortment format in the U.S. The result of the intensifying store development and competition from Aldi and Lidl in the U.K. has been prolonged deflation for over two years, with grocery prices now about 6% lower than they were in late 2014. And now Britain's grocery retailers are also threatened by the arrival of AmazonFresh. As in the U.S., the new wave of small store competition (including the threat of Amazon) has increased “supply,” squeezed profits, and forced major and wrenching responses by British food retailers. For example: • Widespread cost-cutting and price reductions — although the continuing deterioration of the market position of Walmart's Asda operation (the former price leader) appears to be proving that this, by itself, is not enough. • Severe cutbacks in the numbers of new stores being opened and on individual store sizes (few, if any Tesco Extras). Reduced store sizes are the inevitable result of the weakened position and appeal of center-store products and brands. • Biting the bullet on bad locations, and improving the quality of new store site selection. For example, the new management at Morrison's has closed all its hastily opened M-Local convenience stores (many were former Blockbuster Video stores!) and is now working with Rontec, a fuel retailer that has a proven site selection record. • Reflecting changing demographics, such as smaller households, any expansion is now focusing on small (3,000-square-foot) stores such as Marks & Spencer's Simply Food. These "convenience stores" are totally unlike the American model, focusing on fresh foods and ready meals, and including finely honed ranges of grocery staples. As a result, they attract more female customers than do U.S. c-stores. • There is a renewed focus on core operations. Under new leadership, Tesco and Marks & Spencer have closed distractions, formerly justified by "extending the brand" groupthink. In Tesco's case, the axe has been wielded on overseas expansion (Fresh & Easy), restaurant operations (Giraffe) and garden centers (Dobbies). • Central to the focus on core operations is increasing the appeal and performances of existing supermarkets via premium private brands (e.g. Tesco's Finest) and products (e.g. organics, “free-from,” locally sourced). In addition, true meal solutions (not U.S.-style portions or kits) remain a core weapon in “restaurant substitution.” That is, preventing sales losses to — or taking sales from — the inherently more labor-intensive and higher-priced restaurant business. There are signs these strategies are working. The growth rates of both Aldi and Lidl are now cooling — although still leading the pack. However, problems remain. Sainsbury failed with its Netto franchise (from Dansk Supermarkets), an attempt to imitate the Aldi format, and is now pursuing an ambitious “digital strategy” through the acquisition and integration of Argos (the non-foods catalog showroom retailer). Time will tell if this is successful. For competitive reasons — and the opportunity presented by a densely populated market — British grocery retailers have invested heavily in e-commerce. However, there is now a major question mark over the economics of money losing "click-and-deliver" operations, even in densely-populated Britain. Reportedly, the average cost of a grocery delivery in the U.K. is about $20 (U.S.) — but the average fee to each customer is only approximately $7 (U.S.). Amazon may work out these economics but outside of London and other major cities “click-and-collect” is emerging as a much sounder business model. Most grocers — in both the U.K. and U.S. — may ultimately have to recognize Sol Price's wisdom concerning the “intelligent loss of business.” There are obvious implications from much of the above commentary for the U.S. supermarket industry. However, the key takeaways may be the following: a) Don't wait for deflation to end. For competitive reasons, it may not — particularly if the U.S. dollar remains strong. b) Margins and prices will have to fall, as belatedly recognized by The Fresh Market, for example. This process is being driven in the U.S. by Walmart as it confronts the growing competition presented by Amazon as well as the continuing impacts of Aldi, Lidl and the dollar stores. c) Price impacts will not be conveniently limited to the low end of the market. Reflecting the Domino Theory, they are working their way upwards throughout the entire spectrum of store formats — including local and regional quality and service chains as well as Whole Foods and the other natural/organic retailers. d) Finally, grocery retailers need to be cautious about their “digital strategy,” particularly outside the fashionable inner districts of major urban areas. Grocery delivery should not be viewed as a must-have premium service. Remember that Amazon is allergic to profits, and that service and quality problems go with the territory. It may be a business that needs to be surrendered to a small number of providers — with click-and-collect being the best bet for an economically viable digital offering.

A deputy from the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office said he was on routine patrol at 10:50 a.m. Saturday when he spotted a blue Toyota in the parking lot. The driver of the car, identified as Donell Barron, 34, told the deputy that he and his family lost their home in Port St. Lucie about a year ago. The registered owner of the car is Rikki Hart, 34, but the report doesn’t state what her relationship is with Barron. Barron said they had been living in various hotels for about 10 months until they ran out of money and had been living in their car. In that time, Barron told the deputy that his five children, ages 14, 8, 6, 5 and 4, had been bathing in the Okeeheelee Park bathrooms and urinating in a bucket that is carried in the car. The children, who do not attend school, were all found to be underweight with their bones visible and lethargic, according to the sheriff’s report. Barron said the children were only fed once a day and mostly vegetables. PBSO said when they went to McDonald’s to buy the children some food, the children “ravenously ate the meals, as if they had not been fed in quite some time.” Greenacres Fire Rescue responded to the scene and determined the children needed to be transported to Palms West Medical Center and placed them in custody of the Florida Department of Children and Families. The police report said Barron made a variety of strange statements saying he attended “three years of law school and practices law, but not as a lawyer.” Barron also said he was a “world citizen” and has a given name as well as a “corporate name.” Later, the sheriff’s report says Barron changed several of his original statements and said he lost all of his money in the stock market and had never been to law school but wants to give legal advice. The Sheriff’s Office said both Barron and Hart appeared to be in good health with relatively clean clothing despite the conditions of their children. The couple have a blog created in 2014 called “Holistically Beautiful” that says was created “to show the benefits of living a healthier lifestyle and discuss topics which can enrich ones’ life.” Both were booked into jail Saturday and face child neglect charges.

Matthew Mills of Biddeford, Maine, posted the picture on Sunday and it has since been shared thousands of times. He captioned the photo with “This guy got a lesson in parking.” Since the photo was posted, a man who says he’s a friend of the driver told WMTW-TV that it was an accident because of snow and ice, and said the photo was taken after it melted. “She came into work and slid into her spot because of an icy spot and couldn’t park straight, and then someone rudely put carts around her car,” the friend said.

Here’s an example of a home-delivered meal from Blue Apron. Photo: Matthew Mead, Associated Press Walmart pulls Black Lives Matter T-shirt; Pokémon on Apple Watch 1 / 1 Back to Gallery At Walmart, blue trumps Black Lives Matter Walmart has pulled a Black Lives Matter T-shirt from its online offerings amid complaints by police. The company told Fox News Insider that it will no longer sell the shirts with the words “Bulletproof: Black Lives Matter” on its website. The move came after the Fraternal Order of Police called the shirts offensive and asked the retailer to stop sales. Pokémon go to Apple Watch “Pokémon Go” is now available on the Apple Watch, squashing rumors that the game’s maker was scrapping such plans. The game, from San Francisco’s Niantic, will let players discover the animated characters on their watches, but they still need their iPhones to catch them. The Watch should make it easier for players to log their steps (needed to advance in the game and to hatch Pokémon out of eggs), and to avoid walking around with their phones held out to search for nearby monsters. Blue Apron’s IPO simmers Meal-kit delivery company Blue Apron has put preparations for an initial public offering on hold, people familiar with the matter said, as its leaders focus on improving its finances. Even with more than $800 million in revenue this year, the company has struggled to improve profit margins as much as management wanted in the face of more competition, the people said. A stronger performance is needed to support the $3 billion valuation that the company is seeking for its IPO. The Daily Briefing is compiled from San Francisco Chronicle staff and news services.

Chris Johnston December 22, 2016, 6:52 PM Chris Johnston   December 22, 2016, 6:52 PM PHOENIX, Ariz. – There’s a running joke among the guys who keep the Arcadia Ice Arena going year-round about the Zamboni now being the most valuable thing in the place. The 50-year-old rink is tucked behind a Walmart in the corner of a mall parking lot and has a certain time-worn charm about it. In this unexpectedly fertile ground for hockey, Arcadia holds two significant distinctions: 1.) It is the oldest of the 11 sheets of ice currently operating in the Valley of the Sun. 2.) It is the place where Auston Matthews joined his first mite team after being turned away elsewhere. That helps explain how the Zamboni came to have the 19-year-old’s signature scrawled large across a panel below the driver’s seat. Matthews stopped by a couple days before the NHL draft in June and arena worker Rob Holthaus seized on the opportunity to have him gild the ice resurfacer. He even took a picture of Matthews wielding the sharpie in case anyone ever called its authenticity into question. “He’s just such a humble kid,” said Holthaus. “I figured the only thing better than getting something signed for myself was getting something for the entire rink.” At this ice cube in the desert, securing ice time is a challenge. The facility is open 365 days a year and the schedule is crammed full – well, other than the four one-hour sessions that just opened up on Friday night. You see, so many families involved with the Arizona Bobcats youth program have bought tickets to see Matthews play his first NHL game at Gila River Arena that the coaches decided there wasn’t much point in holding practice. The Coyotes-Leafs game had been circled on calendars here for months, but the interest went up another notch earlier this week when word started circulating that Matthews had committed to joining Arizona forward Max Domi for a picture with all local youth hockey players in attendance afterwards. “It just blew up,” said Cammielle Becker, the board administrator for the Bobcats. Never mind that the organization had already pre-paid at a rate of $350 per hour. Call it a sunk cost in the name of dream-building. “They’re willing to walk away from four sheets of ice in order to go to a game so that the kids that skate in this program can see someone who wore their logo,” said Becker. Matthews is already a beacon. A local legend. The folks at Arcadia are so mindful of his growing status in the wider hockey world that they carefully protect any memorabilia tied to him. The Zamboni is kept behind an “authorized personnel only” sign in an area not visible to the public. A signed Bobcats sweater and some pictures hang behind closed doors in the office of Jim Rogers, who owns the facility and was Matthews’ first coach. Even a trophy won by the 2003-04 Vosha Mustang Mites – featuring No. 14 Auston Matthews – is tucked away in the pro shop, away from where others are more openly displayed. That was the first organized team Matthews played for. Rogers still recalls the young boy showing up here with his father Brian – “tears in his eyes” – after being denied the chance to join other organizations. The six-year-old Matthews was given a spot on the eight-and-under Mustangs, thus starting a unique journey to the NHL that saw him play all over the Valley. “He just went wherever he could find competition,” said skills coach Boris Dorozhenko, an influential figure who became a close family friend. “Everyone put a little pebble in his development.” Matthews is, in many ways, the product of a divided system. The Bobcats and Jr. Coyotes organizations are fierce AAA rivals – akin to the Montague and Capulets, according to Becker – and have been known to court each other’s players. Matthews spent time with both youth programs and several other teams. It took him to the Oceanside Ice Arena in Tempe and a now-shuttered 3-on-3 facility closer to where he grew up called Ozzie Ice. He also skated in close proximity to his Coyotes heroes at the Scottsdale Ice Den. Rogers describes Matthews as a strong-minded kid who possessed an insatiable desire to score goals. His path from modest beginnings to stardom with the Toronto Maple Leafs isn’t much of a mystery to a man who witnessed his first formative strides. “There was no magic wand,” said Rogers. “It all started with Auston’s character.” It is still too early to quantify what kind of impact he’s had on hockey in the region, although former Coyotes GM Mike Barnett predicts it could end up being as significant as anything Wayne Gretzky did previously in the U.S. southwest. “He can make it the game everyone wants to try and play here,” said Barnett. His son, J.T., was also raised in Scottsdale and is currently playing in the KHL. He’s five years older than Matthews and phoned his dad one day after participating in a skills session led by Dorozhenko at Arcadia. “He called me in my office and said: ‘I just skated with the sickest 13-year-old I’ve ever seen; his name is Auston Matthews,”’ recalled Barnett. “I’ve never forgotten that conversation.” Barnett, now a senior advisor with the New York Rangers, will be there to watch Matthews play on Friday night. So will Dorozhenko and Rogers and Ron Filion, his Arizona Bobcats coach for three seasons. So will an estimated 500 local youth hockey players, many of whom will be wearing the same yellow Bobcats jerseys Matthews once donned. “A lot of people are claiming to know him,” observed Coyotes captain Shane Doan. Here at Arcadia they seem more proud than possessive. The rink was buzzing during two afternoon public skating sessions this week. They even lowered a fully decorated Christmas tree onto the ice surface, claiming it was the only place other than Rockefeller Center you could find such a thing. They speak fondly of Auston’s last visit here in the summer – “He signed everything,” said Becker, including her son Blaise’s blocker – and are following his career closely. They packed the Ice House Tavern built into the visitor’s end of the rink for a party on the night Matthews was drafted – nearly missing him become Arizona’s first No. 1 pick because the power went out – and grew to an overflow crowd again as he scored goal after goal in a record-breaking NHL debut against Ottawa. Now they’ll get to see him play the Coyotes live and in the flesh. For Rogers, a straight-talking local who was drawn to hockey by Team USA’s “Miracle on Ice” at the 1980 Olympics, an event like this is a long time coming. He lied about his age to land a part-time job driving the Zamboni at Arcadia back in high school and has since turned the sport into his life’s work. He’s also a Coyotes season-ticket holder who has seen a lot of kids take their first tentative steps on a rink he now owns. One of them was a six-year-old who could improbably fire the puck over the net from centre ice. His name? Auston Matthews. “People say it’s a one-shot wonder, but we’re going to have another one,” said Rogers. “I promise you that.” %2Fhockey%2Fnhl%2Fauston-matthews-childhood-rink-beams-pride-ahead-hometown-return%2F Join the Discussion EDITORS' PICKS Florida Panthers honour victims of airport shooting | 1 hour ago West Coast Bias: Flames, Canucks play in crucial home-and-home | 5 hours ago Will the Leafs try to acquire a defenceman via trade this season? | 4 hours ago Galchenyuk, Markov practising good news for banged-up Canadiens | 3 hours ago Why Evgeny Kuznetsov is pacing towards a 23-point dip in production | 7 hours ago MOST DISCUSSED Uncomfortable off-season testing patience of Blue Jays fans 706 COMMENTS Maroon's hat trick leads Oilers to narrow victory over Bruins 455 COMMENTS USA wins gold in shootout win over Canada; Terry hero again 278 COMMENTS Canucks-Flames matchups highlight NHL's weekend betting action 305 COMMENTS Canadiens' Brendan Gallagher out at least eight weeks after hand surgery 270 COMMENTS Maple Leafs increasing level of Auston Matthews' competition Decreased obstruction calls obstructing NHL's best attractions Sports NHL MLB NBA NFL CFL SOCCER CURLING TENNIS AUTO RACING More TELEVISION RADIO TIM & SID BIG READS INSIDERS SN WORLD SN NOW RSS Social FACEBOOK TWITTER YOUTUBE GOOGLE+ About SN MEDIA CENTRE COMPANY INFO ADVERTISE FAQ FEEDBACK © 2000-2017 Rogers Media.

Article Tweet Change text size for the story Print this story Report an error Trees have been trimmed, halls have been decked, tables are being set and relatives are all gathering as Edmontonians prepare for the Christmas season. But as the countdown to Christmas turns from days into hours, Edmonton Sun Adopt-A-Teen still has 2,880 teens in need on our list who are unaccounted for. As of Thursday afternoon, generous donors have gifted Adopt-A-Teen with $306,000 — enough to put a gift under the tree for 6,120 teens on our list, teens who without you would go without. Adopt-A-Teen's 2016 campaign was the biggest ask we've yet made of Edmontonians, hoping to provide a $50 Walmart gift card for as many as 9,000 impoverished teens at Christmas. It can be hard to picture the full scale of poverty in Edmonton, but on the first day of the Christmas Bureau of Edmonton's Walk-In Days — where families who missed the deadline to apply can come to the Jerry Forbes Centre at 12122 68 St. on Thursday and Friday and apply in person to receive a Christmas hamper through the Christmas Bureau of Edmonton, toys for their children from 630 CHED Santas Anonymous and a $50 Walmart gift card for every teen in their home from Adopt-A-Teen on the spot — lines stretched outside the door. “I think there are a lot of families that have tried to see as best they could if they could pull things together, and they just can't,” said Darlene Kowalchuk, executive director of the Christmas Bureau of Edmonton. “They want to give their kids a proper Christmas, a traditional Christmas, something they have done year after year, that we do year after year and take for granted.” Tough economic times across the province have pushed many families into poverty, and as demand for services grows, donations dwindle. “There's a lot of desperation out in the community now,” said Kowalchuk. “Definitely with the economy, everything that is happening right now has caused a lot of people to come looking for help that normally wouldn't.” While impoverished families struggle throughout the year to make ends meet, Christmas can prove an especially trying time. By working together, the Christmas Bureau of Edmonton, 630 CHED Santas Anonymous and Adopt-A-Teen help ensure every family, regardless of their circumstances, can be included in the joy the holidays bring. “Thank you for your kind gesture and making my daughter's Christmas wish come through, God bless you all,” wrote one mother, who was able to afford the perfect gift for her teenage daughter through help from Adopt-A-Teen. Help us make Christmas wishes come true for every underprivileged teen on our list. For more information, or to donate online, visit us at www.adoptateenedmonton.ca To make a donation over the phone, call the Christmas Bureau of Edmonton at 780-414-7694 during regular business hours. Cash or cheques made out to "Adopt-A-Teen Edmonton" can be dropped off in person at any Edmonton fire hall. Cheques can also be mailed to Adopt-A-Teen, c/o The Christmas Bureau, #200, 4230 118 Ave. NW, Edmonton, AB, T5W 1A4. twitter.com/AdoptATeen  As Advertised in the Edmonton SUN Adopt-A-Teen Adopt-A-Teen: Hours left and thousands of teens still need your help at Christmas By Claire Theobald First posted: Thursday, December 22, 2016 06:10 PM MST | Updated: Thursday, December 22, 2016 06:19 PM MST Trees have been trimmed, halls have been decked, tables are being set and relatives are all gathering as Edmontonians prepare for the Christmas season.

Business Home LBoard Police: Religious depts not tough enough against extremism Muzliza Mustafa Read More FMT BAHASA FMT BORNEO+ FMT VIDEO CONTRIBUTE NEWS HOME NATION OPINION WORLD LEISURE SPORTS BUSINESS ADVERTISE WITH US Asian stocks fall after Wall Street rally stalls AFP | December 23, 2016 Asian markets were hit after the Dow's closely monitored quest to hit 20,000 points hit another roadblock Thursday, with declines by retailers Wal-Mart Stores and Home Depot contributing to the index's second straight fall. HONG KONG: Most Asian markets fell Friday following a retreat on Wall Street and as oil prices weakened on the last trading day before Christmas. Regional stocks mirrored negative sentiment globally, with shares of US retailers falling sharply Thursday on anxiety about the holiday shopping period, and European stocks under pressure over worries about Italy’s ailing Monte dei Paschi di Siena bank. Hong Kong, Shanghai and Sydney were all down Friday amid muted sentiment ahead of the holiday, although Seoul posted a modest rise, while Tokyo was closed for a public holiday. Oil was also struggling Friday, with both contracts down. Asian markets were hit after the Dow’s closely monitored quest to hit 20,000 points hit another roadblock Thursday, with declines by retailers Wal-Mart Stores and Home Depot contributing to the index’s second straight fall. But volume was depressed due to many traders taking a vacation ahead of the holiday weekend. The yen — which has fallen sharply against the greenback since Donald Trump’s shock US presidential election win in November — rose against the dollar Friday as the greenback’s rally stalled. However, analysts tipped the US currency to build on its recent strength in the New Year. “Going into next year, we are confident the dollar will continue to make headway. It will be the currency that appreciates in 2017, it’s just a question of how much,” Andrew Milligan, head of global strategy at Standard Life Investments in Edinburgh, told Bloomberg News. Italy bank bailout Observers are widely betting Trump’s plans for a fiscal stimulus will stoke growth in the world’s largest economy, and speculation of higher spending has already sent the dollar to near a 14-year high against the euro. Mainland Chinese investors have been fretting over a weakening yuan, which has plunged 13 percent against the greenback since its peak in January 2014. The world’s second largest economy is also facing massive capital outflows as investors seek better and more stable investments abroad. The mood in Asia was not helped despite news Friday the Italian government has approved a bailout plan to rescue the country’s struggling banks on Friday, with Monte dei Paschi di Siena (BMPS) likely the first in line to receive state aid. BMPS is at the centre of a crisis in Italy’s financial sector, which includes some 700 banks and is buckling under the weight of bad loans estimated to total 360 billion euros. The plight of the stricken Italian lender has sparked fears of a possible rekindling of the eurozone debt crisis.

Well, you want to buy something that ties into the person’s interests or hobbies. You want something that’s reliable, safe and recommended by a good source. And you want something that fits in your budget.  To match all those criteria, consider the venerable Consumer Reports and its 2016 Holiday Gift Guide, which breaks down products by different categories to make it easier to pick out the right gift. Play Video Your Holiday Financial Guide Popular tech gifts this holiday season If you got a late start on your Christmas shopping, don't worry. CNET senior editor Ashley Esqueda joins CBSN with some ideas for last-minute tec... CR’s Gift Guide suggests presents for people who are into technology, those who like to cook or just eat, and those who like home appliances. You’ll also find categories based on who you’re shopping for and how much you want to spend. You can browse each category to view the top picks, along with brief descriptions, price and where to purchase. Since it doesn’t accept advertising, Consumer Reports has long enjoyed a reputation as an impartial and independent judge of the best products on the market. So following its advice seems like a good way to pick out just the right gift for people who aren’t always easy to shop for. So let’s peruse the gift ideas CR suggests by category to see if it takes some of the challenges out of holiday shopping. Gifts for tech lovers Personal technology is a hot category and one that CR has filled with a variety of gift ideas. Under the category called “The Gift of Tech,” CR has served up recommendations on everything from headphones to to computers. Here are some the many gift ideas: 1) The Phiaton BT 100 NC headphone is available from Amazon for $100. Offering very good sound quality and noise-canceling technology, this headphone sits in place securely through a collar that fits around your neck. 2) The Sonos Play:5 (2015) wireless home speaker is sold by Amazon for $465. The speaker delivers very good sound, is simple to set up and can provide audio for a medium to large room. 3) The Apple TV (32 GB) (4th Gen) streaming media player is available from Amazon for $150. The latest version of Apple’s set-top box comes just in the nick of time for the holidays. It offers a speedier processor, a touchpad remote control and support for the Siri voice assistant. 4) The Amazon Echo wireless speaker is sold by Amazon for $180. Using a voice assistant known as Alexa, the Echo is a speaker system that resides in your home to provide news and weather, play music, order products online and control smart home appliances. Alexa can respond to your questions and commands, perform specific tasks and connect to Amazon’s cloud-based services. 5) The Lenovo Ideacentre 700 all-in-one 24-inch computer sells for $900. This one is a “lightning-fast desktop computer,” according to CR, with the power to help you edit videos and provide ample storage with its 1 terabyte hard drive. 6) The Epson Expression Premium XP-830 inkjet printer, scanner, and copier will cost you $104 at Amazon. This device offers a touchscreen display along with a feeder for copying and scanning documents. You can also send paperless faxes via your computer. 7) The Samsung Galaxy S7 smartphone goes for $650 at its full retail price. Outfitted with a 5.1-inch screen, Samsung’s latest flagship phone offers a 12.2-megapixel rear camera, healthy battery life and a water-resistant glass body. The base model comes with only 32GB of on-board storage, but you can up that to more than 128GB with the right microSD card. 8) The Apple Watch Series 2 (38mm) Aluminum case smartwatch runs $470. Apple has updated its smartwatch series with new features, most notably ones geared toward fitness buffs. The watch is now water-resistant up to 164 feet, includes built-in GPS to track your jogs and lets you share your workout details with other people. 9) The Microsoft Surface Book laptop starts at $1,499 at Walmart. Equipped with a detachable screen that transforms it into a tablet, the base model of Microsoft’s Surface Book offers a 13.5-inch touchscreen display, an Intel Core i5 processor, 8GB of RAM and 128GB of onboard storage. Those specs provide a hefty amount of power, but you can upgrade the processor, memory, and storage to truly beef up the machine. The Surface Book is ideal for photo and video editing, said CR, while the included Surface Pen helps you draw and take notes easily and precisely. 10) The Apple MacBook 12-inch MF855LL/A computer goes for $1,200 at its base configuration. Outfitted with a 12-inch Retina display, this model features a speedy Intel Core M 1.1GHz processor, 8GB of memory, a 256GB solid state drive and Intel HD Graphics 5300 graphics. A weight of only 2 pounds and 16 hours on a single battery charge are icing on the cake. The one item missing is an optical drive, so you’d have to buy an external drive if you need to use a CD or DVD. Appliance gifts Home appliances may not always be sexy, but they can certainly come in handy to help your gift recipient better take care of the home, more easily tackle housework, and cook up tasty meals more quickly. Here you’ll find everything from robot vacuums to microwaves to cookware to coffee makers. Some of the gift ideas include: 1) Samsung POWERbot SR20H9051 Series vacuum cleaner sells for $1,000. This robotic vacuum earned a top score from CR because of its ability to effectively clean both carpets and bare floors. The Samsung product’s edge brushes serve nicely to clean along walls, while the unit’s squared-off front helps it clean corners better than most of the competition. 2) The Roomba 880 vacuum cleaner is a less pricey robot vacuum than Samsung’s model, selling for just $500. The Roomba 880 was CR’s top pick before Samsung’s vacuum debuted and is still highly rated for its ability to clean both carpets and bare floors. And since it’s only 4 inches tall, this Roomba excels at cleaning under sofas and other low-ceiling objects. 3) The Samsung MC11H6033CT microwave oven goes for $300. Equipped with a convection mode, Samsung’s microwave can brown and crisp food better than rival units. The unit earned good grades for its ability to heat and defrost food evenly. You can even use it to bake a cake. 4) The Swiss Diamond Reinforced 10 piece #6010 kitchen cookware sells for $500 to $600. For that price, you get 8-inch and 9-inch frypans, 1.4-quart and 2.2-quart saucepans, a 3.2-quart saute pan, an 8.5-quart stockpot, and glass lids. The cookware is made of cast aluminum and offers nonstick coating. 5) The Bialetti Moka Express Stovetop Espresso Maker starts at $22 at Amazon. Available in five different sizes and various colors, the Bialetti Espresso Maker impressed Consumer Reports as it’s found in the homes of almost 90 percent of Italian households. The design ensures that heat is distributed evenly and that the two halves are easy to connect. Gifts for teens and ’tweens Looking for a present for your son, daughter, nephew, niece or someone else in the younger crowd? CR serves up some suggestions here, such as the Apple MacBook 12-inch MF855LL/A computer,  the Apple Watch Series 2 (38mm) Aluminum case smartwatch, and the The Lenovo Ideacentre 700 all-in-one 24-inch computer. Other ideas included the $99 1MORE E1001 Triple Driver headphone that offers “excellent sound quality” and comes with nine different earpieces in various sizes, the $350 Braven BRV-XXL wireless Bluetooth speaker that’s rugged enough to take with you on outdoor excursions, and the $200 Fujifilm FinePix XP90 digital camera equipped with a 6-megapixel lens, a 2.9-inch LCD, and 5x optical zoom. Gifts for moms and dads Find it harder to pick the right gift for your parents each year? CR’s suggestions may just help narrow down the choices. For mom, the magazine recommends Apple’s iPhone 7 starting at $650, the Fitbit Surge fitness tracker running for $250, and an iCoffee RCB100-BC12 coffee maker for $105. For pops, you may want to consider such items as a Garmin Vivosmart HR fitness tracker for $119, an LG OLED55E6P 55-inch 3D-capable OLED Ultra HD TV for $3,165, or a $600 Nikon Coolpix P900 digital camera. Gifts for grandmas and grandpas Looking for the right present for your grandparents? Some ideas from Consumer Reports include the Amazon Kindle Oasis WiFi e-book reader for $289, the $92 Clarity BT914 cordless phone with built-in answering machine, and the $40 Hunter QLS-03 portable humidifier. Gifts that best fit your budget Sometimes you’re seeking the right present for a family member, relative, friend, co-worker, or even just a casual acquaintance and don’t want to spend too much. CR’s gift ideas include items under a certain price if you’re working with a specific budget. Don’t want to spend more than $200. Consider such items as the $150 Apple TV (32 GB) (4th Gen) streaming media player, the $180 Asus ZenPad S 8.0 Z580C-B1 (32GB) tablet, and the $120 Brother MFC-J680DW all-in-one inkjet printer. For less than $100, you can snag a $60 Bell Draft Mips bike helmet for bicyclists, a Krups 2-Slice KH732D50 toaster for as little as $40, and a Ninja Personal Blender for $75. Need to go even cheaper? CR’s gift ideas under $50 include a Cuisinart CastLite Non-Stick 10-inch CIL22-26R kitchen cookware for $35, a Cuisinart Power Advantage HM-50 mixer for as little as $33, and a Scosche SportClip 3 headphone for as low as $28. And finally, if you don’t want to shell out more than $25 on a gift, check out the $22 Bialetti Moka Express Stovetop Espresso Maker, a bag of Blue Bottle Three Africans coffee beans for $15, and the Proctor-Silex Cool-Touch 22203 toaster for a little as $16. © 2016 CBS Interactive Inc..

Regional stocks mirrored negative sentiment globally, with shares of US retailers falling sharply and European stocks under pressure over worries about Italy's ailing Monte dei Paschi di Siena bank. Shanghai suffered the sharpest downturn Friday of almost one percent, while Hong Kong ended 0.28 percent down and Sydney also shed 0.28 percent on a shortened trading day in Australia ahead of the Christmas holiday. Tokyo was closed for a public holiday, Singapore fell 0.28 percent and Seoul edged up 0.01 percent. "Hong Kong stocks are troubled by capital outflows," Ben Kwong, executive director at KGI Asia in Hong Kong, told Bloomberg News. China is facing massive capital outflows as investors seek better and more stable investments abroad. Traders on the mainland were also grappling with fears over rising borrowing costs in the world's two largest economies. The US Federal Reserve raised borrowing costs earlier this month, while China has tightened monetary conditions. And oil struggled Friday, with both contracts down. Asian markets were hit after the Dow's closely monitored quest to hit 20,000 points struck another roadblock Thursday, with declines by retailers Wal-Mart Stores and Home Depot contributing to the index's second straight fall. - Italy bank bailout - In forex trade, the yen -- which has fallen sharply against the greenback since Donald Trump's shock US presidential election win in November -- rose against the dollar Friday.

Related News/Archive Have you noticed golf carts zipping down your street? That's UPS delivering holiday packages 3 Weeks Ago Which Tampa Bay neighborhood home values will rise most this year? The answer may surprise you. 9 Hours Ago Shhh, your washing machine might overhear you 1 Day Ago You may not have heard of the 96-year-old company, but chances are you come in contact with people wearing its apparel every day. "Sometimes when going home, I look on either side of the road and see our clients everywhere," Michael Benstock, Superior Uniform Group's CEO since 2003, said recently during an interview at his office. More than 5 million employees in the United States wear Superior's uniforms every day in sectors like health care, retail, transportation, private security and food service. Superior's portfolio of impressive Fortune 500 clients include household names like Walmart, Lowe's, Waffle House, CVS, Walgreens, Disney, Sonic and many more. The company was founded in 1920 by Benstock's Lithuanian great-grandmother in Long Island, N.Y., with his grandfather building and expanding the business. It went public with an IPO in 1968, relocated to Pinellas County in 1978 and switched from the American Stock Exchange to the Nasdaq in 2008. From 2011 through 2015, the company experienced 17 percent growth, practically doubling its net sales from $112.4 million to $210.3 million, and is expected to top out at roughly $250 million for 2016. Superior has diversified, too, stepping into other industries like the production of promotional products, staffing remote call centers, distribution and program management, and now has manufacturing facilities in Central America, the Horn of Africa, and south and east Asia. Superior posted net income of $13.1 million, or 90 cents a share, in 2015, compared to net income of $11.3 million, or 82 cents a share, a year earlier. With accolades, awards and prestigious annual rankings to its credit, Superior Uniform Group was named to Fortune magazine's list of the 100 fastest-growing companies in the world in September, coming in at No. 24. How did it get there? Much of it can be credited to the growth under Benstock's leadership. "You have to be laser-focused on projecting where you want to be and tuning out some of the day-to-day noise," Benstock, 61, said. "We manage our business long term, and you've got to have great people. I'll take fire in the belly over a college degree any time." Benstock's style and background go against the grain of what most people think makes up a typical executive profile. Although he finished high school at 16 and attended Cornell, Lehigh and Tel Aviv universities, he readily admits he never graduated from college, instead winding up in Israel, where he said he became a citizen and joined the Israeli Defense Forces, serving from 1974 to 1979 as a member of its underwater demolition teams. He's up at 4 a.m., out of the gym by 5:30 and the last out of the office, he said. Keeping his 1,200 employees happy starts by being engaged, he said. "Everybody wants to know that what we're doing is interesting, but they also want to know if there's something else available that's more interesting and pays better," he said. "Business is not about standing still and still succeeding. You've got to satisfy shareholders, so you've got to grow." Negotiating deals and buying companies are challenges that appeal to Benstock — not for the vanity and ego, but for the simple reason that most of what is earned is typically poured back into the company, he said, which makes it stronger. And he doesn't mind letting people know Superior Uniform Group is well organized. "There's not another publicly traded company in Florida that has as solid of a balance sheet than we have," he said. The company has an ambitious long-term objective of exceeding organic net sales growth at a rate of 6 percent per year, he said. With the number of acquisitions Superior has been undertaking, it's a realistic goal, Benstock said. In March, Superior bought Los Angeles-based BAMKO Inc., a merchandising company with subsidiaries in Hong Kong, England, Brazil and China, and an affiliate in India, according to a statement Superior released at the time. Benstock confirmed Superior bought BAMKO Inc. for $15.8 million in cash. As a part of the deal, the uniform company issued about $5.5 million in shares of its stock that will vest over five years. Further, Superior agreed to a possible payment in the future of up to $5.5 million in additional contingent consideration through 2021 and is assuming some of BAMKO's liabilities. Before BAMKO, Superior acquired uniform maker HPI Direct in 2013 for $34.8 million in cash and stock, plus future payouts, Benstock said. He hinted at another acquisition on the horizon for Superior but wouldn't give a name. According to Sanjiv Bhaskar, an analyst and vice president of research at Frost and Sullivan, the fact that Superior made the top 100 fastest growing companies in the world in Fortune is significant. "Superior has their own manufacturing facilities around the world — that helps them have control over their design," Bhaskar said by telephone from San Antonio, Texas. "The good news for the uniform services industry is that there are plenty of smaller companies to gobble up. And they are a good acquisition company. They have the experience of acquiring and integrating those companies successfully, something they seem to have mastered, which is good for them." Benstock suggested the company may have to think about expansion when asked how Superior keeps the good times going. "Just keep doing what we're doing," he said. "It seems to be working so far. I've only got room for 80 more cars in the parking lot." You may not have heard of Superior Uniform in Seminole, but you probably see their apparel every day 12/23/16 [Last modified: Friday, December 23, 2016 6:12pm] Photo reprints | Article reprints © 2017 Tampa Bay Times      Abuse Policy Commenting Guidelines Join the discussion: Click to view comments, add yours Loading...

Home FREE KP CLASSIFIED AD Submit Announcement About Us Circulation Contact Us CONTEST Watch Family-Life TV Live Stream Here NewsDesk Puzzles INFORMATION CENTER Today’s Edition Obituaries Hundreds Participate in Annual Lion’s Club Holiday Dinner Approximately 500 meals were prepared for senior citizens by Kittanning Lion’s Club volunteers on Sunday, December 10. by David Croyle The dog may not have been sitting at their feet waiting for a morsel of food to fall from their plate, but everything else resembled a holiday meal with family in a really big dining room of the St. Mary Parish Hall. This was the 41st year for the Kittanning Lion’s Club to serve up large helpings of turkey, stuffing, potatoes, a vegetable, and, of course, dessert. Delores Croyle, an East Franklin Township resident and Secretary for the Club, recalled the humble beginnings of the festive event. “They started it because of when they first built the highrises, they said there were senior citizens who either had lost their spouse or their family had moved away and they would not bother preparing a holiday meal. So, we thought that we would give them a free dinner between Thanksgiving and Christmas so that they would at least have one nice meal. And, then it just expanded to everybody.” Prior to the meal on Sunday, December 11, there were 475 reservations. However, despite a snowy day, the final count was more than 380 meals packaged for take-out and 120 people dining in the hall. As the event has grown throughout the years, so has the budget. Delores praised various merchants and organizations for their support. “We’ve been getting donations from different people. Wal-Mart is a big donor towards this event. We received donations from Rosebud Mining; from Dr. Frank Genovese -who is one of our associate members; and from Representative Jeff Pyle. Because of all the donations people give, it really doesn’t cost our Lion’s Club all that much, usually about $300-$400 total to feed a turkey dinner to 500 people.” It takes quite a few helpers – from meal preparation through the actual serving of the meal. “Other than getting the orders by individual members ahead of time, we spent 4 hours (Saturday). There were 16 of us here getting things ready (Sunday morning),” Delores estimated. “Sprankles cooked the turkeys for us and brought them over like 7 yesterday morning and then our members deboned them and we make everything ahead. We bought the buns from Sprankles. We got other things from Shop-n-Save and Sam’s Club – all the supplies for the meal. We have the Armstrong River Hawks Leo Club and the Lenape Vo-Tech Leo Club helping. Without them, we probably could not be serving all these people. We’ve probably got 20-25 people helping today from 7 in morning and til 3PM.” Alice Kammerdeiner lives at Garden Towers in Kittanning. She normally spends Thanksgiving and Christmas with her daughter on Hazel Street, but this is a special time for them. She was grateful for the hard work of the volunteers. “It’s delicious! The food is very, very good,” she said. “I’ve been here before.” Delores said the outreach by the Lion’s Club has special meaning to her. “I know my mother used to like getting this dinner because she was one that wouldn’t be preparing a dinner at this time. I’ve got relatives who’ve come in and they are enjoying the dinner. I like watching the people. They make it a social event. There are several that get together with their friends. I take the reservations and I’ll see like 6 people all signed up at once. And, they come in, and they sit, and they talk, and socialize. They spend longer than it takes just to eat a meal. The people enjoy themselves and then they stay with coffee afterwards and just talk.  It’s a nice socialization type of little party before Christmas.” Delores said the Kittanning club has members from different areas. “Our members are out in Adrian; we have some down Freeport; but basically Kittanning. We have some from Ford City even though there is a Ford City club. The Manor Club closed and so we have some from that area and out towards Kittanning Township. Rural Valley has its own Club and Worthington has its own Club. So, we’ll take anyone in between. We’d like to have members from Templeton too, but no one from that direction has asked to join us. We’re always looking for new members.” Persons who are considering joining the Lion’s Club can contact a member for an application. Annual dues are $55. A group of 25 volunteers did everything from preparation to serving a holiday meal to nearly 500 senior citizens at the St. Mary Parish Hall. This is the 41st year that the Kittanning Lion’s Club has offered a turkey dinner with all the trimmings between Thanksgiving and Christmas.

The company, which has been in her family four generations, ceased operations at the end of June. Rick West | Staff Photographer   Lauren Rohr Follow @LaurenRohr     Political battles in Kane County, a new chairman in McHenry County, construction projects throughout the area and some leadership changes at the municipal level were among the most memorable moments for towns in the Fox Valley in 2016. Here are some of the top stories: Haeger Potteries closes after 145 years: Haeger Potteries, a family-operated business for four generations, closed its doors last summer after 145 years because of overseas competition and the economic downturn. After the announcement of its closing this spring, however, people throughout the suburbs and beyond rushed to the East Dundee factory store to purchase the final pieces of Haeger pottery. President Lexy Haeger Estes said the outpouring of support from Haeger fans and collectors was humbling and overwhelming. The building has since been sold to local manufacturer Golden Plastics USA. Elgin Tower Building redevelopment: The Tower Building in downtown Elgin has new owners after nearly two years of negotiations for a project to turn it into apartments. - Rick West | Staff Photographer Built in 1929, the Elgin Tower Building suffered a slow deterioration with tenants gradually leaving until the building was condemned in 2014. In late September, after nearly two years of laborious negotiations, was the groundbreaking of a $16.6 million project, led by Capstone Development of St. Louis, to turn the building into rental apartments expected to be ready for opening in May. Free college credits: A select group of Community Unit District 300 high school seniors are getting a free full year of college this school year. The district is partnering with Elgin Community College on an Accelerate College program. The first of its kind in the suburbs, the program allows eligible high school seniors the ability to take a full year of college classes toward a two-year associate degree -- completing roughly half the required credits for a 60-hour program -- in arts, science and applied science. Upon graduation from high school, students can choose to complete their associate's program at ECC or transfer those college credits to any Illinois college or university. This prompted state legislators to approve the creation of a statewide pilot program modeled after District 300's program.

Seven months later, her social media accounts have stayed silent, her friends haven't heard from her, and nothing has come from leads and tips -- numerous at first, dwindling as of late -- received by South Elgin police. Her mother, Fiona Galvin, hasn't given up hope that Kianna, who turned 18 in July, will return home safely. Fliers and pink ribbons are still posted throughout town, and loved ones held a vigil last month to remind people of Kianna. Clash between Kane County officials: Kane County Board Chairman Chris Lauzen The fallout between Kane County Board Chairman Chris Lauzen and State's Attorney Joe McMahon began when Lauzen condemned McMahon for giving state's attorney's office employees what Lauzen deemed as year-end bonuses. Shortly after, McMahon provided a legal opinion that Lauzen had broken the law and county code by giving no-bid contracts to an outside law firm. Lauzen then expressed no confidence in the legal abilities of McMahon and his employees. McMahon also pointed out Lauzen's "disconcerting" involvement in the awarding of a bid to another law firm that would help the county sell bonds to pay down pension debt. At the end of the year, McMahon sent a letter warning that Lauzen was in violation of the Illinois Open Meetings Act for not posting meeting minutes in a timely fashion. Lauzen then attacked McMahon for the bonuses again, calling them payments for loyalty and popularity. School board president thwarts shooting: St. Charles School District 303 Board President Steve Spurling and his wife Diane were out for a walk in early May when they saw a bloodied woman running from her home and her husband following behind her. Spurling's wife went to comfort the woman when, according to police, Scott Turyna pulled a gun and fired several shots in her direction. Spurling tackled Turyna, disarmed him and held him until authorities arrived. Turyna, 65, was charged with attempted murder. Spurling was later recognized for his actions, which police said saved two lives. McMahon named special prosecutor: Kane County State's Attorney Joe McMahon is sworn in by Judge Vincent Gaughan as the independent attorney to prosecute former Chicago police officer Jason Van Dyke during a hearing in August at the Leighton Criminal Courts Building in Chicago. - Pool Photo / Nancy Stone / Chicago Tribune In early August, Kane County State's Attorney Joe McMahon was named a special prosecutor in the case of former Chicago police officer Jason Van Dyke, who is accused of first-degree murder in the shooting of Laquan McDonald, 17, in October 2014. "We have one goal in this case, and that's to present the truth in court and seek justice," said McMahon, an Elgin resident who also is rumored as a candidate for U.S. Attorney under the new Republican presidential administration. McMahon also has three Kane prosecutors and a prosecutor from Winnebago County on his team. Locker room access for all: The state's second-largest school district's move to allow locker room access to a transgender student sparked controversy and upset many parents. As of Sept. 6, Elgin Area School District U-46 has allowed a transgender middle school student use of the locker room corresponding with the student's gender identity at the same time as other students. District practice previously had been to allow transgender students to change in the locker room of their choice when other students weren't present. A decision on Haines: Middle school closure and construction became the focus of efforts to address declining enrollment and threats to state funding for St. Charles schools. After more than a year of discussion, the district decided to close Haines Middle School and expand and improve the district's two remaining middle schools. Haines parents made a late, unsuccessful push for a tax increase referendum to delay the closure and expand the improvements. Franks elected McHenry County Board chairman:   Jack Franks is sworn in as McHenry County Board chairman in December by his father, Herb Franks. - Lauren Rohr | Staff Photographer In what was considered a historic race for McHenry County, Democrat Jack Franks claimed a victory in the Nov. 8 election as the first popularly elected county board chairman. The Marengo resident defeated Republican Michael Walkup, a District 3 board member. He has already begun implementing some of his plans to lower the county's property tax levy and restructure county government. U-46 board member criticized for Facebook post: Jeanette Ward is an Elgin Area U-46 school board member. Parents, teachers and community members chastised Elgin Area School District U-46 school board member Jeanette Ward over a Facebook post about Black History Month, with some calling for her resignation. The Feb. 1 post by Ward quoted author Jason L. Riley's book "Please Stop Helping Us: How Liberals Make It Harder for Blacks to Succeed." It was posted on Ward's board member page. She quoted Riley as saying, "Blacks have become their own worst enemy, and liberal leaders do not help matters by blaming self-inflicted wounds on whites or 'society.' The notion that racism is holding back blacks as a group, or that better black outcomes cannot be expected until racism has been vanquished, is a dodge. And encouraging blacks to look to politicians to solve their problems does them a disservice." It created a firestorm of criticism. Drug treatment center near Campton Hills: Plans to put a drug treatment facility just outside of Campton Hills failed when the Kane County Zoning Board of Appeals and county board both gave the project failing marks. The Campton Hills village board rejected a nearly identical project and continued to fight the plan in county hearings that proved to be the longest public hearing for a project in the county's history. The investors behind the facility then threatened a $68 million discrimination lawsuit. County board members recently agreed to give the project another look. Elgin leadership changes: Rick Kozal took over as Elgin city manager this year after his predecessor, Sean Stegall, left his post. The city of Elgin this year got a new city manager, Rick Kozal, and a new fire chief, Dave Schmidt, after predecessors Sean Stegall and John Fahy left their posts after seven and six years, respectively. Stegall took a job in North Carolina while Fahy retired and took a job with Elgin Community College. Also, Democrat Cristina Castro was elected in November to represent the 22nd Senate District, a seat held for a decade by Mike Noland, who didn't run for re-election. Pheasant Run agreement: The DuPage Airport reached an agreement with nearby Pheasant Run Resort in St. Charles in August that will not only keep the majority of the existing resort property open, but also help pave the way for an expansion with retail outlets closer to Main Street. Fulfilling a dream:   Kelly Schultz could walk when she was young, but spina bifida took away that ability. She worked toward her black belt this year at Focus Martial Arts in Lake in the Hills and is regaining some use of her legs. - John Starks | Staff Photographer Kelly Schultz of Crystal Lake became the only wheelchair-bound athlete to test for and earn her black belt in karate -- her dream since she was 11 -- in the able-bodied division earlier this year at Focus Martial Arts and Fitness in Lake in the Hills. Schultz, 33, has spina bifida, a birth defect affecting the spine that often causes mild to severe physical and intellectual problems. Higher tax levy for Kane County: Though every candidate on the Kane County Board/Kane County Forest Preserve District Commission ran on platforms of keeping tax levies frozen as long as possible, levy increases went into place for both taxing bodies at the end of 2016. The rising cost of staff salaries was a factor for both entities, as was the loss of some major revenue streams on the county side with the loss of a federal marshal contract at the county jail. New leadership in Dundee-area fire entities: West Dundee Fire Chief Randy Freise will also oversee the East Dundee & Countryside Fire Protection District starting next year. Fire districts in East and West Dundee took a step forward toward a functional consolidation this year by agreeing to share a fire chief. With Chief Steve Schmitendorf, of the East Dundee & Countryside Fire Protection District, retiring, West Dundee Chief Randy Freise will begin overseeing both departments Jan. 1. The Carpentersville Fire Department also hired a new leader this summer after former Chief John Skillman retired. His successor, John-Paul Schilling, created a list of 10 goals and is working to revamp the department. U.S. 20 interchange done in Elgin: Construction of the new interchange at Route 20 and McLean Boulevard in Elgin was completed this year. - Rick West | Staff Photographer The reconstruction of the interchange of Route 20 and McLean Boulevard was finally completed this fall, after more than four years of construction work that affected area businesses and residents. The goals of the $44 million-plus project by the Illinois Department of Transportation were to enhance the flow of traffic, improve safety and reduce the potential for accidents. Queen Noor visits Judson:   Queen Noor of Jordan speaks at the sixth annual World Leaders Forum at Judson University in Elgin. - Rick West | Staff Photographer Queen Noor of Jordan spoke of the urgency of humanitarian response to the Syrian refugee crisis at Judson University's sixth annual World Leaders Forum. Noor's visit was the Christian liberal arts university's and Elgin's first brush with royalty. The widowed queen is the first leader from the Middle East to speak at Judson's forum. In 2015, former Mexican President Felipe Calderón was the first Latin American former head of state to appear at Judson. The American-born Noor, 64, is the widow of Jordan's King Hussein, who died in 1999. She is an advocate for cross-cultural understanding and conflict prevention, missing people, poverty, climate change and disarmament. Dundee-Crown student competes on national TV:   Dundee-Crown High School junior Riley Elmore was a contestant on NBC's "The Voice" this year. The school hosted a rally in honor of the 16-year-old West Dundee resident after he was eliminated from the competition. - Patrick Kunzer | Staff Photographer Dundee-Crown High School junior Riley Elmore made it to the live playoffs on Season 11 of NBC's "The Voice" before the young jazz singer was eliminated from the competition. Elmore, a 16-year-old West Dundee resident, wowed judges during blind auditions with his Frank Sinatra-style voice and ended up competing on coach Adam Levine's team. His peers, teachers and administrators from Community Unit District 300 hosted a rally in his honor when he returned home this fall. Judges, attorneys retire in Kane: The Kane County legal community lost two judges with a combined 46 years of experience on the bench to retirement, along with a highly respected Geneva defense attorney. Judith Brawka, who was the first female chief judge for the 16th Judicial Circuit and served 25 years on the bench, retired last summer. So did Thomas Mueller, an Aurora resident who presided over juvenile court and promoted diversity. Kathleen Colton, a private defense attorney known for her tenacity, knowledge and thoroughness, retired in August. Wal-Mart opens in Carpentersville:   Carpentersville Village President Ed Ritter addresses the large crowd gathered in June during the grand opening of the new Wal-Mart at 365 Lake Marian Road. - Brian Hill | Staff Photographer The highly-anticipated Wal-Mart Supercenter opened at 365 Lake Marian Road in Carpentersville last summer. The company had been planning the move from its former East Dundee location less than two miles away for about four years -- a source of great contention between the two municipalities. Sheriff's deputies returned to schools: Kane County Sheriff Don Kramer made a decision to pull school resource officers away from their usual posts at Burlington and Kaneland high schools in favor of putting them back on patrol. Parents, school administrators and county board members fought the move. After winning some staffing and financial concessions from the board, Kramer returned the officers to the schools. New hospital opens in Huntley:   Centegra Hospital-Huntley opened in August. It's just the third new hospital in Illinois in 35 years. - Brian Hill | Staff Photographer The $230 million, 360,000-square-foot Centegra Hospital-Huntley opened Aug. 9 off Haligus Road, between Algonquin and Reed roads. It is expected to employ more than 1,000 people, including roughly 200 physicians and 450 associates. It offers 100 medical surgical beds, a full-service emergency department, a women's center with 20 private obstetric rooms, eight intensive care beds, 24-hour pediatric care and a helipad for transporting critical patients. Huntley High School students also began serving as part of a unique school-hospital partnership, which allows them to do extensive job-shadowing of physicians and health care professionals. Retirement fund investigates pensions: The Illinois Municipal Retirement Fund launched an investigation into whether McHenry County Board members were expected to work the annual 1,000 hours required to participate in the pension program. The inquiry began after then-state Rep. Jack Franks, who later was elected board chairman, questioned whether several board members enrolled in IMRF were eligible. The county board later voted to be removed from the program altogether, and the investigation was determined to be inconclusive, as program leaders couldn't find enough evidence to prove board members weren't putting enough time into their county positions. Plans unveiled for Batavia apartments: Developer Shodeen Inc. unveiled plans for a $40 million apartment-and-commercial complex in downtown Batavia, at Washington and Wilson streets. The city has agreed to give the land to the developer, including the former First Baptist Church, and to pay for construction of a new city-owned parking deck. Elgin teen tortured by cigarettes: In late February, Elgin police were called to a residence for a report of a woman being held against her will. They found a 19-year-old who was stripped, beaten and who had her shoulder tattoo repeatedly burned by cigarettes, according to Kane County court records. Three females were arrested in short order, but the accused ringleader of the group and ex-boyfriend of the woman, Luis Palomar of Lake in the Hills, wasn't caught until March 22 in Mexico. Each faces up to 30 years in prison if convicted. New Elburn church to be built: St. Gall Catholic Church in Elburn began construction in the spring of a new facility on the southern edge of town. It is trying to sell the current sanctuary and rectory at Shannon Street and Route 47. Famous gymnast visits Elgin: Mary Lou Retton, the first American to win the all-around gold medal in women's gymnastics at the 1984 Summer Olympic Games in Los Angeles, headlined Judson University's World Leaders Forum Inspirational Series this fall. Her five Olympic medals were the most won by any athlete at the Games. Electronics for students: By 2020, all students in Algonquin-based Community Unit District 300 will be equipped with a personal computing device. The district began deploying one-to-one electronic devices in the 2016-17 school year for all students entering first through eighth grades, and will be adding a grade of high school in each ensuing year. New TIF in Geneva:   Demolition of the Mill Race Inn in Geneva began this year. Workers were separating the oldest part of the building, a 170-year-old manufactory, by hand. - Brian Hill | Staff Photographer Geneva also created a new tax-increment financing district for the eastern portion of its downtown, saying buildings in it were at risk of becoming blighted, or were vacant, or were obsolete. Included in the TIF was the vacant Mill Race Inn restaurant. A developer razed most of that building in the fall. U-46 expands dual language program: Elgin Area School District U-46 expanded its dual language program to middle schools this school year. Abbott, Ellis, Kimball, Larsen and Tefft middle schools implemented the 80:20 Dual Language Program in seventh grade -- "80:20" refers to the youngest students starting out with 80 percent of their instruction in Spanish and 20 percent in English. The Spanish-language portion is reduced by 10 percentage points each year from kindergarten through third grade until the split reaches 50-50, where it remains through sixth grade. Alternative school gets new focus: Elgin Area School District U-46's alternative school this fall changed its focus to provide more individualized care for struggling students. Gifford Street High School, which served high school and middle school students who needed help catching up to graduate with their class, is now the Dream Academy. The school now better accommodates students who are not flourishing in a traditional, comprehensive high school setting using a trauma-informed approach. • Daily Herald staff writers Elena Ferrarin, James Fuller, Harry Hitzeman, Madhu Krishnamurthy and Susan Sarkauskas contributed to this story.

Motley Fool Staff (the_motley_fool) Dec 23, 2016 at 6:00AM In this video from Motley Fool Answers, Alison Southwick and Robert Brokamp welcome Motley Fool Chief Wellness Officer Sam Whiteside to the show, as she offers her best advice on how to make it through the holiday season without adding to your waistline. Her first suggestion: Don't use the holidays as an excuse to drink too many of your calories!  A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on Nov. 22, 2016. Alison Southwick: Today we are joined by the Fool's chief wellness officer, Sam Whiteside, and she brings us her best advice to maintain and not gain over the holidays. Hi, Sam. Sam Whiteside: Hi, Fools. Southwick: Thanks for coming back to the show. Whiteside: Absolutely. It's been too long. Southwick: It has been too long. Brokamp: It has. Southwick: So what I like about your "Maintain, Don't Gain" challenge that you do here at the Fool is the idea that, "Listen. We know you're going to overindulge. Just try to maintain. I'm not asking you to lose weight. Just try not to get fatter." Whiteside: Exactly. It's more about being cognizant in the moment, and making sure that you're aware of the choices that you're making. Southwick: Yeah, those choices. All of the choices. Whiteside: All of the choices. Brokamp: So many choices. Southwick: Because many of those choices are around the holidays, and take place at a party or among friends and family, I think it only makes sense for us to eavesdrop, a little bit, on a get-together and discover what trips people up the most over the holidays. Shall we go eavesdrop on a party? Brokamp: Let's do that. Southwick: Let's! [Door opens. Sounds of people talking at a party] Brokamp: I love living in New Hampshire! Southwick: Fill the pool with whiskey! Cannonball! Brokamp: Cannonball! [Door shuts] Southwick: So, yeah. Drinking alcohol. That happens a lot around the holidays. Whiteside: It sure does. Every single party [or get-together] I'm sure we will all attend this holiday season will have some sort of booze. Have you been to a party without booze during the holidays? Brokamp: Not that I'm aware of. Southwick: No. No. Maybe like a kid's birthday... Whiteside: No ... Southwick: ... no, even kids' birthday parties these days have like ... beer. The funny thing about alcohol is not only does alcohol have a lot of calories, but the mixers have a lot of calories and then you end up eating all this horrible food after you drink alcohol. It's just horrible. Brokamp: Did I mention eggnog yet? [00:08:57] Whiteside: Well, it's a funny thing. Let's take a guess. How many calories do you think an average pour of eggnog has? Southwick: Bro looks so sad right now. Brokamp: [Sobs] Don't confront me with reality! Whiteside: I'm going to tell you. It's 340 calories. Southwick: Wow! Whiteside: And 19 grams of fat. Brokamp: But eggs are good for you! Whiteside: Twelve grams of sugar ... Southwick: Wow. Whiteside: ... in a typical eggnog concoction ... Brokamp: Mm. Whiteside: ... so that brings me to my first point. The holidays -- don't use that as an excuse to overconsume and overindulge, specifically on alcohol. There are calories in those alcoholic beverages and just because it's liquid, it does not mean it doesn't count. It definitely goes into your total caloric intake. And so I usually recommend trying some alcohol-free days, specifically during the week when you know that you have a party to go to that Friday or Saturday. Number two. Every other alcoholic beverage -- maybe swap it out for a glass of water. Have that glass of water in your hand when you're walking around the party. That way someone won't come up to you and be like, "Hey, you don't have a drink in your hand." Southwick: Oh, yeah. Fools do that. Whiteside: How many times does that happen? That does happen a lot here. Your hands are empty! Brokamp: Every day, all day long. Southwick: No, not at work. Well, sometimes at work, but not often. Whiteside: So that will reduce someone coming up to you and saying, "Your hands are empty. You don't have anything in your hand." You do, and every other drink is a glass of water.

Be the change you want to see on your buffet table. Motley Fool Staff (the_motley_fool) Dec 23, 2016 at 7:00AM In this video from Motley Fool Answers, Alison Southwick and Robert Brokamp welcome Motley Fool Chief Wellness Officer Sam Whiteside to the show, as she offers her best advice on how to make it through the holiday season without adding to your waistline. Her second tip regards those wonderful holiday potluck meals. But at this time of year, even most vegetable dishes stop being healthy (how many sticks of butter?). So when you contribute to the feast, choose your dish wisely. A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on Nov. 22, 2016. Alison Southwick: I'm going to eat all the carbs. Robert Brokamp: And the dairy. Cheese everyone. Cheese! [Door closes] Southwick: So sometimes going to parties, there's a lot of food. No, always there's food. We're Americans. Of course, at every party there is food and it's not always the healthiest. Whiteside: Yeah. And funny that you mentioned cheese. Most of the vegetables that you will likely see at holiday parties will be covered in cheese or... Southwick: Ooh, fondue! Whiteside: Right, fondue! Southwick: Cannonball! Whiteside: ... are going to be covered in things you might not typically cover vegetables with. Brokamp: Eggnog, for example? Whiteside: Eggnog, yes. Dipped in asparagus. Southwick: Ooh! Whiteside: That sounds amazing. And so I usually instruct Fools or clients to not only make sure you prepare for these parties, [but to] bring a health dish; specifically if it's a potluck get-together. Be the change in the world by bringing a healthy dish to an unhealthy party. Brokamp: You'll be so popular, too. Southwick: Well! Whiteside: And don't just bring a crudités plate or a vegetable tray that you picked up at your local grocery store. Make it fun. I usually do a sweet potato dish that's diced sweet potatoes, red potatoes, and purple potatoes drizzled with olive oil and a little bit of pesto. Stick it in the oven. Pull it right out five minutes before and top it with goat cheese. Not exactly the healthiest option you could ever eat in your entire life, but it's definitely one of the healthier options you might be able to bring to a holiday party. Southwick: You know what blew my mind when I had it? And we had it here at the Fool and we had a nutritionist come. And it was cauliflower to be made like mashed potatoes. Brokamp: I have heard of this, but I never tried it. Southwick: [Whispers] It was amazing. Brokamp: Really? Southwick: It was just cauliflower, salt, and like olive oil. Whiteside: It's hard, sometimes, to tell the difference between a really good cauliflower mash and regular mashed potatoes. Brokamp: Wow! Whiteside: So a good resource that I use a lot is a website called SparkPeople.com. On that website you can easily find all kinds of fitness and nutrition tips and you can also search for recipes that are low in sugar, or heart-healthy recipes, or that might be more diabetic friendly. Or with a specific vegetable. That website I definitely recommend for anyone looking for a healthy option. Southwick: I would also recommend making the recipe at least once before you take it to the party. Whiteside: That, too ... Southwick: Because I have made that mistake so many times where I just show up with this casserole dish and I'm like, "I'm sorry." I hand it over and then I walk away. Whiteside: It looks bad, but it might taste good. Brokamp: So let's say someone doesn't want to gain over the holidays, they go to a party, and they overindulge. Is it reasonable to compensate the next day by basically fasting or just eating vegetables? Can you counteract what you do by going the extreme other way on the next day or for the following week? Whiteside: That's a great question. I'm never really a great proponent of fasting. Your body is a machine. You need to feed it for it to perform, and so I definitely do not recommend fasting. Increasing your vegetable count during the holidays is always a good idea. And it's funny that you mentioned that. The Washington Post actually came out with a piece today that says "11 strategies for getting through the holidays without weight gain," and one of those strategies was to increase your vegetables during this time. So I would recommend that. I would definitely not recommend fasting. Southwick: You also recommended in the past eating before you go to a party. Whiteside: Absolutely. Southwick: So there you go. Get your vegetables in then, Bro ... Brokamp: OK. Southwick: ... so you can pound all the eggnog you want. Brokamp: And my asparagus-nog. Try any of our Foolish newsletter services free for 30 days.

No one quite thought the camps at Standing Rock would be besieged by over four thousand veterans on the same weekend.  Here’s the story in pictures – we’ll have an essay to follow by Ruth in the forthcoming CounterPunch magazine. – Joshua Frank ***   Former Combat Medic Christa McDermont takes selfies with the other veterans’ wives shortly before boarding a bus at Union Station, headed to the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in North Dakota with a cargo of 25 veterans, five civilians and many donations. USAF Vet Sharne Matson, a mother of four, looks rested as she takes her seat on a bus journey which was estimated to take 22 hours. After the first driver takes multiple wrong turns, nearly hits several vehicles and freezes everyone by blasting the a/c throughout the night, the journey extended into 30 hours. Around 4am, the bus stops outside a hotel in Utah for the bus driver to swap out for a new driver. Anthony Aragon, wrapped in a sleeping bag, stretches his legs with the other vets before bedding down for the night. The Veterans wake up the next morning in frozen Utah. Steven Lee, a 37 year old with a soft Southern drawl and a baby face, was a cryptolinguist in the Marines. He now campaigns for deported Veterans and teaches in schools. After 24 hours on the bus, everyone takes a supply break at Walmart and stocks up on last minute items. Amanda Silvestri, one of the first female paratroopers in the 509th airborne infantry, strides along the aisles with 30 year old Elizabeth Torrance, an Iraq Vet. Around 6am on the second morning, the bus eventually finds its way to the Lakota Cultural Center in Fort Yates where a makeshift welcome area has been set up to welcome Vets and provide sustenance, rest, support and directions to the High School where they will sleep for a few hours before heading to the main camp. Sebastian Braidhair of Arizona plays while his Grandfather, Eric Braidhair, a Navajo veterans of fifteen years, sits in the background and waits for the Navajo Nation Veterans to show up at a registration office set up in Cannonball. Sebastian’s uncle is a combat marine who has completed four tours. Elizabeth Torrance takes a picture of camp as the Veterans march over the bridge to Oceti Sakowin after hearing the news that the Army Corps easement was denied. Native American children play in the snow as the various camps celebrate the news that the drilling is temporarily on hold. Around the Sacred Fire many veterans proudly display their cultural roots alongside their military honors. The celebration doesn’t last long for the LA veterans as the bus driver heads into Oceti Sakowin and immediately gets stuck in ice as the temperature drops and night closes in. Martina One Star and Vale Clements watch, amused, as the Vets try and free the bus. They are from the Rosebud Sioux tribe in Arizona and have been at Standing Rock for three months. After the bus is freed, the Vets are informed that because of the huge influx of Veterans, their accommodation has been given away. They are taken in by Camp Rosebud and housed in a former supply store with a faulty stove. Amanda sits surveying their new home with dismay. The next morning a blizzard sets in just as the Vets set off for a ceremonial march to the front lines. Veterans look confused as the Standing Rock elders stop the march from crossing the bridge. Many veterans had planned to be at the front line, taking hits, and were disappointed their role had become merely symbolic. The march is abandoned after an hour, and the Vets stumble back to their camp in zero visibility. As the blizzard worsens, the condensation formed on the roof of the canvas starts to fall back on the girls in the form of snow, and they have little choice but to get in their sleeping bags, cover themselves with a tarp, and get through the night. As the blizzard continues to worsen, tents fall down, catch on fire, and get snowed out. People frantically trying to leave in cars unequipped for the weather cause utter chaos within the camp. The vets make the call to try and leave to the local casino. At the Casino, hundreds of vets and water protectors alike are camping out in the hallways, amongst the slot machines, and under the bleachers while business continues regardless. Will McMichael stands wreathed in smoke having just discovered the elders made the decision not to serve alcohol until the Casino is cleared out. Co-founder Wesley Clark Jr. talks to the LA vets shortly before returning to LA and making the announcement that he had parted ways with the organization, leaving it clear for Michael Wood to form a 501c4 and deal with the catastrophic finances of over 4,500 vets seeking expenses for their trip. Join the debate on Facebook Ruth Fowler is a single mom of one small dog and a large twenty month old living in Venice Beach.

So what if the Republican Party is a widely hated institution, viewed with disapproval by nearly two-thirds of the U.S. populace? Fourteen Narratives to Reject As we struggle to build and expand popular resistance in this new era, here are fourteen narratives for left progressives (and others) to avoid about how this happened and what we must now do: 1 “The Green Party spoiled things for Hillary and elected Trump.” This story line is false. The numbers don’t remotely support it. If one makes the very bad assumption that all the voters who selected Jill Stein would have gone for Hillary if Stein had not been on the ballot, then Stein made the difference in Michigan and Wisconsin.  But that flawed calculation doesn’t explain Trump’s triumph in Pennsylvania, Ohio, or Florida, all bigger battleground states Mrs. Clinton lost.   Stein came in at one percent, nationally. 2 “Hillary was defeated by a big ugly racist, sexist, and nativist white working class ‘rustbelt rebellion’ that catapulted Trump into power.” Nope. The purported great white-Trumpenproletatian uprising has been badly oversold. Trump got pretty much the Republican presidential candidate’s usual voting share of non-college educated whites and whites making less than 50K a year while the Democratic candidate lost working class voters both white and non-white. As the left political scientist Anthony DiMaggio recently noted on Counterpunch, “The real story of the 2016 election is not that Trump won over working class America, so much as Clinton and the Democrats lost it…’Trump did not really flip white working-class voters in the Rust Belt. Mostly, Democrats lost them.’ Per data pulled from various exit polls, Slate reports that the decline of Democratic voters among the working class in 2016 (compared to 2012) was far larger than the increase in Republican voters during those two elections. Of those earning less than $50,000 a year, the decline in Democratic voting from 2012 to 2016 was 3.5 times greater than the rise in Republican voting.” 3 “Vladimir Putin’s Russian hackers did it.” There’s no real smoking-gun proof on Putin’s involvement. The notion that possibly Russia-initiated document dumps to WikiLeaks illustrating the Democratic National Committee(DNC)’s rigging of the primaries against Bernie Sanders cost Hillary the general election is a big reach, to say the least. The Russian hacking charge seems designed in part to help the DNC and the neoliberal Democratic Party elite more broadly avoid responsibility for blowing the election.  The Democrats went with a wooden, Wall Street-captive, and corruption-tainted candidate and campaign that couldn’t mobilize enough working- and lower-class voters defeat the noxious and highly unpopular Trump. The “Moscow Stole It” narrative is a fancy version of “My Dog Ate My Homework” for a dismal dollar-drenched Democratic Party that abandoned the working class and the causes of peace, social justice, and environmental sustainability a long time ago. 4 “The Electoral College screwed Hillary.” Yes, Hillary won the popular vote by nearly three million ballots. The Electoral College (EC) is an absurd violation of the core democratic principle of “one person, one vote.” It is a purposefully undemocratic institutional overhang from the aristo-republican Founding Fathers and their holy Constitution, which was explicitly designed to keep the Founders’ ultimate nightmare – democracy – at bay. It works to Republicans’ advantage because it over-represents disproportionately white and rural states with small populations. But the Clintons and the DNC knew all about the EC, of course, going into the campaign. It’s nothing new, after all.  The 2016 presidential election is the fifth one in American history given by the EC to a candidate who lost the popular vote. The Democrats made no efforts – Constitutional or otherwise – to challenge the Monty Python-esque EC after it (with some help from Florida Governor Jeb Bush, viciously racist and systematic voter suppression, and a Republican Supreme Court) handed the presidency to the open moron George W. Bush in 2000-2001. And Hillary still had no business losing key Electoral College states like Ohio, Florida, and Pennsylvania to Trump, who is heading into the White House with the lowest approval rating of any incoming president. 5 “Comey did it.” Of all the excuses the Democrats advance for why Trump’s victory wasn’t their fault, the chilling James Comey fiasco and the problem of Republican-led racist voter suppression (Greg Palast’s recurrent topic) in contested states are the most credible ones. But there’s no precise way to measure the impact of FBI Director Comey’s creepy political intervention ten days out from the election. The Comey card should not be seen as grounds to pardon Hillary and the Democrats for the dismally uninspiring and centrist campaign they ran. 6 “The Democrats’ 2016 humiliation will show them that they have no choice but to make themselves over as a progressive champion of all working people against the wealthy Few.” Don’t hold your breath. The Democratic Party’s recently installed new U.S. Senate Minority Leader isn’t a liberal or progressive Democrat like Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Bernie Sanders (D-VT), or even Sherrod Brown (D-OH). It’s the neoliberal Wall Street Democrat Charles Schumer (D-NY). The House Minority Leader continues to be the big money San Francisco pro-war corporate Democrat Nancy Pelosi, idiotically endorsed by the supine AFL-CIO over the pro-union heartland progressive Democrat Tim Ryan (D-OH). Yes, the Bernie Sanders-affiliated Congressman Keith Ellison [D-MN] is considered a top contender for the chairmanship of the DNC.  But don’t be surprised if that falls through. He’s getting bashed for past association with Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan and for making some “anti-Israel” comments as a law student in the 1980s. Ellison’s ascendancy to the job of party chairman could cost the Democrats big money.  CNN recently quoted one of party’s biggest donors, Haim Saban, as saying that Ellison is “clearly an anti-Semitic and anti-Israel person.” It gets worse. Last Monday morning on CNN, Daily Beast columnist Patricia Murphy reported on interviews she’d recently conducted with Democrats around the country.  She found “no soul-searching” or critical self-reflection among the Hillary voters with whom she spoke. To the contrary, some Democrats even told her that “we won” because Mrs. Clinton did better than Trump in the popular vote – as if the EC is an irrelevant technicality.  Murphy also reported that the Democrats she spoke with seem ridiculously content to simply write off a huge part of the U.S. electorate – the white working class – as a mass of appallingly racist and sexist brutes (“deplorables”): “What I am astounded by talking to Democrats about what happened in the election, there is no consensus among Democrats about why they lost, or even whether they really lost. So it’s going to be very difficult for them to come up with a cohesive plan about how to move forward. I talked to Democrats and some of them will go back to saying, hey, we won the popular vote, we really did win. You know, it’s just a technicality that we didn’t win the White House. So when you have that kind of an attitude going forward, there are not — there’s very little soul searching, very little effort to look inside and say, what do we need to say and do differently in order to get more people to win? In particular, I mean, they’re writing off a large portion of the electorate as a group of people they don’t even want.” Soul-searching? Nah, it’s more fun to blame others – the Greens, Comey, Russia, and the big mythical racist-sexist-nativist “rebellion” of the “deplorable” white working class – than it is to take an honest look at one’s own failings. 7 “Trump’s election is an antiwar victory.” Come on. Yes, the Russia-hating NATO-expansionist warmonger Hillary “Queen of Chaos” Clinton seemed recklessly Hell-bent on a dangerous confrontation with Moscow – a confrontation that candidate Trump clearly wanted not to have. And yes, we do have some breathing space on the score for the next few months. Still, Trump’s campaign reeked with hyper-masculinist white-nationalist and anti-Muslim militarism. The coming “militarization of the West Wing” is quite pronounced. Trump has said profoundly dangerous things about the use and spread of nuclear weapons. His “defense” appointments and his rhetoric and Tweets (seriously?) point to coming dangerous conflicts with China and Iran, both key Russia allies. Don’t rule out conflict with Russia and the cooling of Trump’s hot bro-mance with Putin down the road.  Anyone who thinks Trump’s ascendancy heralds a new American era of pacifist isolationism – a retreat from imperial war as a central tool of U.S. “statecraft” – is engaged in some very seriously delusional thinking. 8 “The corporate and financial establishment hates Trump and will undermine him.” There may be some truth in this assertion but it should be treated with extreme skepticism. Hillary was their first choice, but Wall Street is playing make-up with Trump. Top financial services trade groups like the American Bankers Association have run to help Trump fill top financial regulatory positions in the next White House.  The Financial Services Roundtable is raising $4 million to help Trump “pay for the transition process.”  After Trump defeated Mrs. Clinton, the former harsh Trump critic and current Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein praised the victor as “market friendly and asset friendly.”  A Wall Street Journal three weeks ago was titled “Wall Street and Trump Make Up Quickly.” It matter-of-factly noted that “After largely opposing his 2016 presidential campaign, financial service executives are making fast friends with President-elect Trump… Wall Street,” the newspaper reports, “could wind up being a big winner under Mr. Trump, despite his broadsides against big banks during the campaign.” The accommodation makes perfect sense. Janus-faced finance capital runs like water to the powers that be at the end of the day. The elite financial sector is looking forward to significant regressive corporate and personal tax cuts and financial deregulation with Republicans in charge of both the White House and Congress in coming years.   The stocks of Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have been on a great run ever since the election. And Trump has given current and former Goldman Sachs elites and other top finance-capitalists (including coming Commerce Secretary and noted billionaire Wilbur Ross) numerous key economic policy positions in his coming administration. Every month, CNN reports, President Trump will consult with a group of top U.S. business executives convened by Steven Schwartzman, CEO of the infamous “alternative investment” firm the Blackstone Group. The group includes a “who’s who” of current and former Fortune 25 CEOs, featuring (so far) GM’s Mary Barra, JP Morgan Chase’s Jamie Dimon, GE’s former CEO Jack Welch, Disney’s Bob Iger, and Walmart’s Doug McMillon. The “populist” Trump is certainly doing his best to seduce the financial chieftains he sometimes railed against on the campaign trail. It isn’t just the financial elite he’s making up with. A New York Times report nine days ago related how Trump reached out to Silicon Valley captains: “The meeting between President-elect Donald Trump and the nations tech elite was hyped as something out ‘The Apprentice’: The new boss tells his minions to shape up. It turned out to be a charm offensive, a kind of ‘Dancing with the Silicon Valley Stars.’” ‘This is a truly amazing group of people,’ the president-elect said on Wednesday in a 25th-floor conference room at Trump Tower in Manhattan.  The gathering included Jeff Bezos of amazon; Elon Musk of Telsa; Timothy D. Cook of Apple; Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook; and Satray Nadella of Microsof, among others. ‘I’m here to help you folks do well,’ Mr. Trump said.” “He kept going in that vein. ‘There’s nobody like you in the world,’ he enthused.  ‘In the world!’ There’s nobody like the people in this room.’ Anything that government ‘can do to help this along,’ he made clear, ‘we’re going to be here for you.’” “And that was just in the first few minutes.  The candidate who warned during the presidential campaign that Amazon was going to have antitrust problems, that Apple needed to build its iPhones in the United States instead of China, was nowhere to be seen…on the way out, Safra Catz, the co-chief of Oracle who attended the meeting, gave a thumbs-up.” (NYT, 12/14/2016). Smart move by Trump. Silicon Valley stands alongside Wall Street and the military-industrial complex (MIC) as the three most powerful Big Business components of the state-capitalist Deep State that runs the nation beneath and beyond the marionette theater of electoral politics. As Mike Lofgren notes in his indispensable new book The Deep State: The Fall of the Constitution and the Rise of a Shadow Government (Penguin, 2016), “the Valley has far outstripped traditional smokestack industries as a generator or wealth and has generated individual fortunes that easily rival those of Wall Street. Its research and development operations are vital to the operation of the Deep State – not only for its globe-spanning surveillance technology, but for the avionics, sensors, and guidance systems of every plane, ship, tank, missile, and drone that the military buys.” Could Wall Street, Silicon Valley, and/or the MIC end up undermining Trump before it’s all over? Certainly. But there’s a honeymoon of sorts of underway right now and it would be foolish now to invest one’s hopes for the destruction of the Trump nightmare in the corporate and financial elite. 9 “Trump doesn’t really mean all the nasty stuff he said to get elected. He will govern differently than how he ran for office.” Well, candidate Trump certainly didn’t really mean it when he claimed to be a populist champion of the American working class in its struggle with Wall Street and other corporate-globalist evil-doers. Just look at his arch-plutocratic transition team and cabinet-in-formation.   Trump’s populism was fake, of course.  But Trump’s quasi-fascism probably isn’t and it would be foolish indeed to normalize what’s happened. Expect the administration’s racist and nativist scapegoating to accelerate in rough proportion to Trump’s service to the wealthy Few. The more he makes policy in the interest of his super-opulent upper-class comrades, after all, the more Trump is going to have to try to distract and divide the working-class majority with ugly racist and nationalist finger-pointing. 10 “All the people and others who have protested the Trump victory and ascendancy are silly sore losers manipulated by George Soros and MoveOn.” Yes, the left needs to watch out for elite liberal/neoliberal and Democratic Party-affiliated agents (for me that includes Sanders’ “Our Revolution”) working to control and manipulate anti-Trump resistance. Absolutely. But the reflexive denunciation of all anti-Trump protesters as childish agents of the Democratic establishment takes pseudo-radical cynicism to a new low. Folks don’t need to be prodded by slimy actors like Soros and MoveOn to find some very good and obvious reasons to march against incoming Trump administration. 11 “Resistance to Trump is illegitimate on the part of people who failed to adequately protest the neoliberal and imperialist Barack Obama presidency.” Yes, it is depressing that many U.S. citizens can’t seem to get it together to fight back when the White House is held by a smooth-talking teleprompter-ized Democrat like Bill Clinton, Obama, or (as I and most left analysts expected) Hillary Clinton. It’s sad and irritating that it seems to take a brutish white male Republican in the White House for a lot of Americans to protest and resist Deep State policies that are in fact richly bipartisan. But, okay, it’s a fact. Work with the opportunity afforded by the new public enemy number one – the coming appalling Trump administration – to build a new popular resistance movement that cannot be hijacked by movement-killing Democratic Party electoralists and opportunists and the deadly election cycle. Connect with people on issues and do your best to show them why such a movement is worthwhile 12 “Noam Chomsky and other left intellectuals and activists who called (again) for Lesser Evil Voting [LEV] were shills for Hillary Clinton.” There is a recurrent debate on the U.S. left about whether progressives should vote for Democratic Party candidates as the “lesser evil.” I’m on the anti-LEV side of that debate for reasons I won’t rehearse here. But it’s a difference about strategy and tactics, not underlying world-view. It’s unfair to call fellow leftists “shills” for Hillary when they referred to Mrs. Clinton as a “lying neoliberal warmonger” (Adolph Reed, Jr.), a “right-wing fanatic” (Arun Gupta), and, well, evil. (I used to make the left-LEV argument myself and was no less of a radical when I did than I am now. My position changed on tactical and strategic grounds.)  Demonizing folks who come (often for some defensible if ultimately flawed reasons) to the LEV position (I know some very smart and radical folks who do)  is also dysfunctional going forward. As Chomsky himself has long argued, the question of how to vote (or not) for five minutes in the one-every-four-years candidate circus is a secondary matter compared to much more important and urgent politics of movement-building beneath and beyond the nation’s populace-marginalizing and mass-marketed quadrennial electoral extravaganzas. Do we really want sniping over the question of what was the best lane to be in on the bourgeois-electoral highway to get in the way of acknowledging the many things you agree with, say, Chomsky or Reed or Gupta about? In the way of forming an anti-Trump resistance?  In the way of building great people’s movements beyond the election cycle – movements that should include in their list of demands a call for radical electoral reforms what would allow progressives to back candidates aligned with their values without fear that doing so might help the rightmost of the major capitalist parties prevail?  I think not. At the same time, many on the other side of the quadrennial intra-leftist voting debate also need to stand down from snotty sniping over what was the best way to respond to the terrible “choices” on offer in the U.S. presidential voting booth.  Both sides might want to think of this endless and ugly debate as yet another form of top-down divide-and-conquer. 13 “The 2016 Election Shows the Futility of Any and All Identity Politics. Serious Progressives Must Reject Any and All Such Politics in Favor of Class Politics.” Nonsense. Yes, the Left is committed to the bottom-up political struggle of the (multiracial-multiethnic-multi-religious [partly irreligious] and multi-gendered) working class against the capitalist wealthy Few. But we cannot and must not simply abandon the particular realities of: female experience and oppression: Black experience and oppression; Latino experience and oppression; Muslim experience and oppression; gay experience and oppression, and so on. Such class-reductionist denialism leads nowhere morally or politically. What needs to be rejected is the sickening kind of bourgeois identitarianism that candidate Hillary advanced. As Conor Lynch noted on Salon last month, “The Clinton campaign tried to make this election all about Trump’s hatefulness (‘Love Trumps Hate’) and his ‘basket of deplorables,’ while offering no real vision of progressive and populist change. And when those on the left raised legitimate concerns about Clinton’s uninspiring message or her political baggage during and after the primaries, they were ridiculously labeled sexist or racist ‘bros’ by establishment figures (even though some of Clinton’s harshest progressive critics were in fact women and people of color ).” Earlier in the year, Daniel Denvir insightfully described the Clinton’s strategy as “peak neoliberalism, where a distorted version of identity politics is used to defend an oligarchy and a national security state, celebrating diversity in the management of exploitation and warfare.” The left at its best has always understood identity differently – in ways that are opposed to both ruling class divide-and-conquer (ala Hillary Clinton and Herr Trump) and to class reductionism (ala some of Bernie Sanders’ supporters). As the “unrepentant Marxist” Louis Proyect recently reflected on Counterpunch: “While the idea of uniting workers on the basis of their class interests and transcending ethnic, gender and other differences has enormous appeal at first blush, there are no easy ways to implement such an approach given the capitalist system’s innate tendency to create divisions in the working class in order to maintain its grip over the class as a whole…My own experience goes back to the 1960s when the Trotskyist movement was still rooted in American realities. Party leaders conceived of the coming American revolution as a kind of united front of different struggles that would come together on a basis of shared class interests. If that is a concession to ‘identity politics,’ I plead guilty…A socialist movement that disavows particular Black demands and those of other sectors of the population acting on their own interests on the basis of gender, sexual preference, etc. will inevitably lack the universality it needs to triumph over a unified capitalist class. To state it in dialectical terms, denying the existence of contradictions and refusing to resolve them will only lead to deeper contradictions.” (emphasis added) That strikes me as brilliantly stated – and emblematic of the sort of intelligent, reality- and history-based Marxism for which no repentance is due.  Working class left “identity politics” is very different from what Denvir calls “neoliberal identity politics.” 14 “Trump’s election shows that U.S. politics and society is completely hopeless and pathetic. It’s time to retreat into personal concerns.” That’s your option, of course, but it will only make things worse. The Chicago-based anti-racist writer and activist Jamie Kalven rightly worries about the “danger…that people will become demoralized and retreat into denial, that they will seek refuge amid the pleasures and fulfillments of private life.  That would give carte blanche to power…That is certainly tempting at a time like this,” Kalven adds: “to live one’s life in the wholly private realm, enjoying the company of friends, good food and drink, the pleasures of music and literature, and so on.  Privileged sectors of our society are already heavily skewed that way.  It’s a real danger at a time like this.  If we withdraw from public engagement now, we aid and abet that which we deplore.” (The Chicago Reader, December 8, 2016,emphasis added). The threat to become an “expatriate” (which I am hearing again and again online) is a particularly pouty and privileged version of the same dysfunctional syndrome.  Becoming an émigré – either internal (retreating into private life) or external and literal (leaving the county if you can) – will fix nothing. (And, by the way, you can’t really escape the American Empire on this planet.) Two Narratives to Handle with Extreme Care Here are two narratives not to be rejected so much as to be handled with extreme care. 1 “There are great popular movement-building and system-challenging silver linings – from a dialectical and radical perspective – in Trump’s victory.” I do not simply reject this “accelerationist” storyline. To the contrary, I recently specified what some of those “silver linings” might be. Kalven is right, I think, when he says that “this is a moment of great opportunity – and also peril. The election of Trump certainly increases peril, but it may also increase the clarity we need to be effective…one door closes, another door opens.” But the “silver lining” trope should come with two key qualifications.  Caveat number one is that none of the movement opportunities afforded by Trump’s coming presidency (and by the discrediting of a dismal dollar-drenched Democratic Party that proved itself too corrupt, unimaginative, corporatized, dull and conservative to defeat Trump) are going to show themselves in real history without dedicated and difficult day-to-day rank and file activism connected to radical-reformist and revolutionary vision – real progressive policy ideas and societal alternatives.  The second caveat is that Trump’s election is a grave threat to vast swaths of humanity at home and abroad and indeed to life itself. It is indeed a great black cloud. If you are or seem happy that a vicious racist and sexist bastard like Donald Trump is moving in the White House, then God help you, comrade. “It’s important now.” Kalven adds, “to take time to absorb what’s happened and to grieve…I’m looking for a word besides catastrophe.” The word fits. 2 “The left must overcome single-issue obsessions.” I agree with that statement to a very significant degree. How could I not after decades of witnessing progressives fighting on numerous separate causes that cry out for consolidation and common struggle in a many-sided anti-capitalist movement? The left is way too scattered, issue- and other-wise. But it’s not true that none of the left’s issues stand out above all others.  We need to be candid and forthright about the primacy of the environmental question. The capitalogenic climate change-driven threat of ecosystem collapse by the end of the current century is now “the biggest issue of our or any time” (John Sanbonmatsu). As Noam Chomsky has argued, nothing that we care about on the left is going to matter all that much if environmental catastrophe isn’t averted soon by serious efforts to – among other things but first and foremost – keep fossil fuels in the ground and shift to renewable energy. Who wants to more equitably share out the pieces of a poisoned pie? What good is it to turn the world upside down and “inherit” (take) it from the ruling classes if the planet has been poisoned beyond safe habitation? Of all the dreadful things about the coming Trump administration, the one that strikes me as most horrific and most urgently in need of dedicated popular opposition is Trump’s arch-petro-capitalist commitment to the Greenhouse Gassing-to-death of life on Earth. The opposition already has a North America movement vanguard, so to speak: the remarkable multi-tribal struggle of Native Americans and others who came together beneath and beyond the election cycle to confront Energy Transfer Partners’ planet-cooking Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) in Standing Rock.  Expect Trump to target the North Dakota pipeline fighters and water-/climate-protectors as “economic terrorists.” Prepare to defend those environmental heroes as the leading symbols and agents of the Resistance we need to build and expand if humanity is going any shot at a decent future.

Find Christmas Eve Deals At Walmart, Best Buy, Amazon And Apple Stores By Tim Marcin @TimMarcin On 12/23/16 AT 8:34 AM Close It's almost Christmas and you still haven't gotten gifts for everyone. Don't panic! In a world that's increasingly wired and well connected, a great tech gift might be the perfect fix for your Christmas gift woes.  Here are some items you can get in stores this week at the last second, all of which will be sure to please this Christmas. Best Buy The Google Home could be a perfect product for any techie. It's essentially like living in a long-imagined future where you speak commands  — such as "Play a favorite song" or ask a random question — and the little, oblong speaker calmly answers. You can purchase one at Best Buy for $129 but you could save up to $30 on a combined purchase, according to the store's site. The store is also running a "deal of the day," which you can find here. A recent example was a 39-inch, Insignia LED television for just $159, a $30 discount. The store also has a page dedicated to ongoing deals, which you can find here. Some of the best deals include HP laptops for $80 less than usual, nearly half-off Skullcandy headphones and half-off Bluetooth speakers. Best Buy is also still running deals on iPhone 7s. For Verizon customers that means a discounted price on an installment plan while AT&T customers can buy one and get one free. Sprint customers, meanwhile, get a $200 store gift card. Walmart There are a number of tech deals at Walmart this holiday season. Some tablets are about $60-$100 off in the lead-up to Christmas. A higher-end Samsung Galaxy tablet can be had for $188, which represents $112 in savings. There are also too many deals on TVs to list as well as a number of deals on laptops, including some HPs and Samsungs for less than $200. Almost everything on sale can be ordered online and picked up in store the same day. Amazon The online e-tailer famously runs 12 days of Christmas deals, but has also put together a holiday electronics gift guide here, which has a number of ideas for gamers, drone hobbyists, computer-lovers and everyone in between. Related Stories CES 2017: 5 Smartphones Expected To Be Launched Last Minute Gift Ideas For Christmas 2016 It's also running deals on its entire Alexa home system, which is a lot like the Google Home. The Amazon Echo is going for $139.99 while and Echo Dot (a smaller speaker that allows the Echo's range to expand to other rooms) is on sale for $40.  The electronic deals shift at Amazon, but they can provide good savings. One recent deal was a gaming keyboard at a 60 percent price reduction. Apple stores It's a bit more difficult to find deals at Apple stores, but that doesn't mean there aren't great gifts to be had. Apple Watches now go for as little as $269 while accessories like specialty bands go for about $50. The Apple TV, which goes for $149, could also be a good idea for a cord-cutter.

McIntyre December 23, 2016 8:40 am EST Print Email Tweet Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google sites were at the head of U.S. internet properties in November, based on unique visitors. They posted over 246 million according to comScore, ahead of second-place Facebook Inc. (NASDAQ: FB) at 209 million. Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ: YHOO) sites were the only others above 200 million, as a group logging in third place at 206 million. Other than the largest search engine company and world’s largest social medium, the media and portal sites at the top of the list have struggled to drive advertising revenue enough to be highly profitable. Microsoft sites ranked fourth at 189 million, which included its MSN portal. Portal company AOL ranked in eighth place with 160 million unique visitors. The only e-commerce site in the top 10 was Amazon at 141 million. Wal-Mart sites ranked 17th with 111 million. Among the largest media sites, CBS Interactive had 167 million, followed by NBCUniversal, which was behind it by only a few hundred thousand visitors. Behind them, Turner Digital, which includes CNN, had 152 million. The Time Network had 128 million, followed by the USA Today Network at 122 million and New York Times Digital operations at 118 million. While e-commerce company Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) has had spectacular success, portals and media companies continue to battle over the very modest ad market that is left after ad spending on Facebook and Google, the revenues of which have been put at over 50% of all new online spending in 2015. The nature of the trouble for media companies that have moved much of their content online from traditional TV and print has shown up in their earnings. For example, Yahoo and Time Inc. have been dealing with falling revenue, with no ready solutions. Google and Facebook are the largest U.S. properties, and they get an outsized portion of online revenue. I'm interested in the Newsletter Get Newsletter terms and conditions   By Douglas A.

Nineteen-year-old Sawyer Lee Aston was apprehended during the lunch hour Thursday, Dec. 22, in the parking lot of the Walmart shopping center along the 31700 block of Grape Street. Deputies were summoned to investigate a report of a mentally disturbed person, Sgt. Luke Torres said in a written statement. "The suspect's mother called police, stating she saw him walking though the parking lot...and she believed he was possibly carrying a firearm," according to the statement. Shortly before deputies arrived, a business manager was accosted in the parking lot as he was entering his vehicle. "The suspect pressed a pistol against the manager's head and demanded the...keys," Torres wrote. "Deputies arrived during the crime...and took (Aston) into custody. "The pistol was found to be a semi-automatic BB gun replica." Anyone with additional information may call deputies at 951-776-1099.

While the Walmart-owned supermarket Asda is selling the seasonal veg for just 20 pence, budget retailers Aldi and Lidl have undercut the chain by a penny. The offer from Asda, which boasts numerous stores across Coventry and throughout Warwickshire, includes 1kg Grower's Selection Carrots, 500g Grower's Selection Sprouts, 500g Grower's Selection Parsnips and 360g Growers Selection Broccoli. Asda say shoppers will save around £2.2million on Christmas vegetables thanks to the price-cuts. For those who prefer to shop at Lidl, the German supermarket has also lowered their prices of some Christmas staples too. For 19p you can buy either a pack of 1kg of carrots, 500g of sprouts, 1.5kg of British mini-roast potatoes, or 500g of parsnips. Andrew Moore, Asda’s chief merchandising officer, told The Sun: “There’s been a lot of talk about food inflation this year but Asda customers can be confident that their festive feast will deliver on value as well as taste this Christmas. “Sprouts will sit proudly on every plate next Sunday and when they cost 49% less than last year, you’re more likely to love them than hate them – especially when they are served next to our delicious Butcher’s Selection turkey crown that is just £6.75 per kilo."

Hong, File 296 Follow Share Tweet With many running out to get their last minute shopping done, parking lots tend to get frustratingly busy a week before Christmas. So when someone trying to finish up their Christmas shopping arrived at a Wal-Mart in Maine and found a car carelessly taking up two parking spots, they decided to take action. Matthew Mills of Biddeford, Maine, posted a picture on Facebook of a silver Nissan boxed in the parking spots with shopping carts, writing, “This guy got a lesson in parking.” Perhaps the owner of the car will think twice before committing such a crime against humanity.

"I think the personal income number yesterday was disappointing, the spending number was disappointing," The Lindsey Group's chief market analyst told "Squawk Box." Boockvar was referring to the Commerce Department report for November's personal income and spending. Personal income remained unchanged from October, while spending edged up 0.2 percent. "Consumers are still stretched, they're still allocating more of their wallet to health-care cost and rising housing costs, leaving less to spend on other things," Boockvar said, making the case that Trump's plan will pass Congress despite trade-related risks for large companies. "I agree there's going to be political pushback here, but the tax plan's going to pass. It's just a matter of how we respond to it," he said. "The whole 'border adjustment' thing is getting [to be] a big deal." Border adjustment refers to the way imports and exports are taxed. A tax reform blueprint written by House Republicans suggests that products should be taxed based on where they are consumed, not where they are manufactured. It also proposes that U.S. exports do not get taxed and imports coming into the country do. "From a company standpoint, the border adjustability is a big deal for them," Boockvar said. Multinational retailers like Wal-Mart that import many of their products are worried that taxes on imports will outweigh their profits, forcing them to raise prices on consumers. "Wal-Mart is at the head of the class in lobbying against this," Boockvar said. Stifel Wealth and Investment Management's Hans Olsen said corporate lobbyists on Washington's K Street could generate enough resistance to the tax overhaul to slow it down. "What he hasn't run into yet is K Street, and when you start monkeying around with tax deductions, tax rates, cherished items that vested interests have, you run into a wall," Olsen told "Squawk Box." "Because K Street, the lobby class, starts to spool up, and they will slow things down. I think that's the risk," Olsen said. show chapters Markets need more clarity: Pro    Friday, 23 Dec 2016 | 6:06 AM ET | 02:37 Independent consultant Alison Deans told CNBC she's concerned that the market rally since the election is based on a lack of clarity about Trump's plans. "It's been a bit of a Goldilocks attitude towards what's going to happen coming out of the policies he's stated, and so at these levels, I'd be concerned," Deans told "Squawk Box." "No matter how you look at it, it's looking expensive in an environment of uncertainty," she added. "I also feel as if the rally seems to be biased towards all the good aspects of the Trump policy without concerns of some of the potential trade issues that could crop up."

Everyone judging each other and themselves. We suggest you shift from “oh my god” to “ommmmm". Motley Fool Staff (the_motley_fool) Dec 23, 2016 at 9:00AM In this video from Motley Fool Answers, Alison Southwick and Robert Brokamp welcome Motley Fool Chief Wellness Officer Sam Whiteside to the show, as she offers her best advice on how to make it through the holiday season with a focus on your health. Her fourth tip can make a big difference to your mental state, which is directly connected to your physical well-being. Just a little meditation will go a long way toward improving both, and it is not nearly as hard as you might think. A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on Nov. 22, 2016. Robert Brokamp: Everyone in my family has opinions on how to cook the turkey and fix our economy. I'm so stressed. [Door closes] Alison Southwick: Yeah, so stressed. I'm actually pretty lucky that my holidays are usually pretty stress-free, but for other people like old Bro, over here ... Brokamp: I think this holiday season will be very interesting, given the recent election, for people who come from mixed political families like I do. So it will be interesting. Sam Whiteside: It will be interesting. So a great way, and an easy way, and a way that will not take very much of your time to make sure that you're handling, managing, decreasing your stress is the "M" word, meditation. The "M" word ... Brokamp: The "M" word ... Whiteside: Some people are so scared of meditation. You'll be so surprised. Or they think, "Oh, gosh. That's not for me. I can't do that." Or, "That's too left field." The idea of meditation is simply to find a quiet space and to try and put more time in between the thoughts that come through your mind. It's not about doing yoga, or standing on your head, or having a certain pose, or being completely quiet and having no thoughts come in. It's basically trying to put more space in between the thoughts that come through your brain. Because we're humans, our brains are consistently trying to create stories around things that come through, and it's basically just trying to decrease that. [To] give yourself more quiet space in your brain. There's some really great apps out there. Some free ones. Calm, Headspace, Omvana, Take a Break, and Smiling Mind are some of the top free apps out there. Some cheap ones are Buddhify and Simply Being. And with each of these apps you can go anywhere from five minutes to 45 or 60 minutes of meditation. You can play with the music. Different themes. There can be guided imagery. An easy way to make sure that you're taking care of yourself and decreasing that stress. Southwick: So what does that mean, though? I think when people think of meditation, they think of someone sitting in the lotus position. Is that what it's called? And just being like, "Ohhmmm." Whiteside: Right. Southwick: While incense is wafting through, and chimes, and stuff like that. Brokamp: Boomm ... Southwick: So what are you going to get from one of these apps? What is this app going to ask me to do? Because if there's some funky mind control in there by some tech company... And yes, maybe I got these conspiracy theories from watching Westworld, but ... Brokamp: Pull out your credit card ... Southwick: What's going to happen when I use one of these apps? Whiteside: That's the great thing about all the apps that I mentioned. There's a lot of different variability that you can play with. You can play with different music or the different sounds. Or having someone speak to you. Or, "No, I don't want to listen to anyone talk right now. I just want to listen to some waves crashing on the beach." And so you definitely have all of those choices with all of those apps that I just mentioned. Brokamp: In a previous episode I mentioned the Beck Diet Solution, which is based on cognitive therapy ... basically how you think affects how you act, and one of the premises of the book is we have all these permission-giving thoughts about eating when we know we shouldn't, and I think stress is a big part of that. I'm very stressed. I know I shouldn't eat this, but I'm so stressed I'm going to go ahead ... Whiteside: Exactly. Brokamp: ... and eat this, or I need that drink because I'm so stressed. Whiteside: Right. We place a link between those things, and there should be no link. Don't give yourself an excuse to have two brownies just because you're stressed out. If you're stressed out, find a different coping mechanism. Find a positive one that's going to impact you in a positive way. Southwick: I'm currently in the process of trying to link running and destressing. Brokamp: It will work, too. Southwick: It does work. I just have to keep reminding myself that I will feel better, and I will feel less stressed if I go run for a little bit. Whiteside: Right. Southwick: But it's like reprogramming myself. Whiteside: Right. And as a Western culture, we associate food with happiness and food with decreasing stress. Or food as a gift. Those are things in our culture I see we can probably work on. It definitely plays a huge role in a family unit. Every time that you get together with your girlfriends, or you have a big family outing, we all eat, or drink, or eat and drink a lot. That's something that provides a lot of joy, but you can find joy in other ways. Southwick: Make it a sometimes. Sometimes food. Try any of our Foolish newsletter services free for 30 days.

Volunteering and doing good works refills your emotional tank during this busy period, which can make it easier not to fill up in other ways. Motley Fool Staff (the_motley_fool) Dec 23, 2016 at 10:00AM In this video from Motley Fool Answers, Alison Southwick and Robert Brokamp welcome Motley Fool Chief Wellness Officer Sam Whiteside to the show, as she offers her best advice on how to make it through the holiday season with a focus on your health. Her final piece of advice: Get out and give back. The best way to improve your mental state amid the stress of the holidays is to volunteer. And the busier you are helping out, the less busy you are eating the cookie batter. A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on Nov. 22, 2016. Alison Soutwick: I do want to hear Sam's bottom-line, best piece of advice for everyone over the holidays, and it is... Sam Whiteside: Shoo! That's a hard one, but if I had to choose one thing, it would definitely be to volunteer. Give back. Specifically during the holiday season, we not only are stressed out, but we're making possibly poor decisions. We're being pulled at all different angles and what I call "keeping your tank full"... Our tanks start to decrease. We start to feel frazzled. So for me, an easy way to keep my tank full or to refill that tank is to give back in some capacity. An easy way to do that for me is to go onto a couple of different websites. One is HandsOn Network. It's definitely an easy way to find local volunteer opportunities wherever you are. If you going to PointsofLight.org/HandsOnNetwork, you will be able to find local volunteer opportunities pretty much in whatever zip code you live in. I have been using that network, probably, for about six or seven years. On Thursday morning on Thanksgiving Day, I will be volunteering at New Hope Housing's Thanksgiving lunch, so I will be making dinner rolls the night before and a potato dish of some kind, and a healthy... Robert Brokamp: A healthy one, of course. Southwick: I've heard of one that has sweet potatoes and regular potatoes. Whiteside: Yeah, where'd you get that from? Brokamp: And asparagus-nog. Southwick: Someone is making asparagus-nog. That's like the meanest thing you could make for someone. Whiteside: That is horrible. That sounds gross. And so I will be serving that food to some of our chronically homeless here in Alexandria. So, yeah. Brokamp: Good for you. Southwick: Yeah! Brokamp: That's great. Southwick: I love that idea, because if you're volunteering, you're not eating, you're not overindulging, and you're also not spending money which we also like to do. Whiteside: Save that money. Brokamp: Could you imagine serving food to the homeless and then overindulging? Taking all their food? That would be horrible. Absolutely horrible. Whiteside: That is not giving back well. That is not going to help you lose those 10 pounds. Brokamp: I'm here for the free food. Southwick: If you did donate asparagus-nog, you would get it all to yourself Try any of our Foolish newsletter services free for 30 days.

An optimistic person could interpret the ornament’s slogan as a calling for all races to come together in a colorblind society. But many interpret it as a direct attack against the goals of the Black Lives Matter movement, which was organized in part to accentuate the plight of black people who feel marginalized by U.S. institutions that disproportionately benefit the white majority. News of the controversy quickly circulated across the internet Wednesday night when one shopper posted a picture of the maligned Christmas decoration to a private Facebook group. The Facebook group had originally been created to support Hillary Clinton’s presidential candidacy this past election.

Photo: Reuters Related Stories ‘Bulletproof: Black Lives Matter’ Clothing Pulled Off Walmart Shelves Trump Plans African-American Issues Meeting After the photo was posted, the Facebook page for the gardening store in the town of Grove Heights was inundated with complaints to remove the ornament. Those offended gave the store negative Facebook reviews in an attempt to tarnish its public image.  “It’s sad and disturbing that a local company would take a swipe at the Black Lives Matter movement during the Christmas season,” said Nekima Levy-Pounds a civil rights activist who was once been the president of the NAACP in Minneapolis, Minnesota. “This time of year is very painful and challenging for family members and loved ones mourning those who have died as a result of police violence. Beyond that, it is clear that all lives will not matter until black lives matter in this country, a pinnacle that has not yet been reached.” In accordance to the tremendous amount of political polarization currently in the U.S., Walmart announced Tuesday it would discontinue selling t-shirts and hooded sweatshirts that alternatively had the words “Bulletproof. Black Lives Matter” on them. An article published last week by the conservative Breitbart news website criticized Walmart for selling the pro Black Lives Matter merchandise after it had stopped selling products that displayed images of the Confederate flag in June 2015.  Walmart had also received condemnation from police departments across the country that thought the slogan insinuated violence against law enforcement officers, according to the Washington Post Tuesday. The national Fraternal Order of Police penned a letter to the retailer on Tuesday requesting it to stop selling the shirts.

This conference is held annually with most attendees being involved directly in the pork genetics industry. One of the key topics this year was consumer perspective and pork quality. Three different speakers, one from the National Pork Board, one private consultant, and one from the warehouse retailer Sam’s Club (owned by Wal-Mart) gave excellent talks about consumers’ wants and how the industry is not meeting these demands, writes Nick Boddicker, PhD. Here are some interesting facts from the speakers: 38% of US households are non-pork consumers 29% of US households account for 62% of the total fresh pork consumed 41% of US households consume bacon Pork is losing linear feet in the meat counter to: - Beef – it's hard to beat a good steak - Chicken – it's healthy and versatile - Salmon – tastes good, healthy, and versatile Seafood is growing in linear feet in retail stores Poultry is winning poundage shares, but not dollar shares Poultry continues to increase in per capita consumption It’s the only meat that is expected to increase based on Sam’s Club models Pork loin demand is on the decline Belly and ribs are supporting the pork cutout Not many pork options on restaurant menus As a whole, these are concerning figures and statements for the swine industry. Clearly, the consumer has spoken by consuming less pork year after year (4% decrease in the last 10 years according to the United States Department of Agriculture), but is the industry listening? At the producer and packing level, pork production is all about pounds of lean meat. This is probably why there are no meat quality standards and why the pork quality grading system has not been updated since 1985, nearly 31 years ago. According to consumer research presented by Laura Bachmeir from the National Pork Board, there is a considerable amount of variation in terms of color and marbling within pork products, such as fresh pork chops, offered to consumers at the retail level. This is not positive as consumers desire with-in product consistency over time. It is difficult to go into a store and get the same quality of product week after week. In order to improve the above figures the industry should change its objectives. All three speakers independently said the same thing; “the pork industry needs to align the grading with consumers demands.” The beef industry has done this and has been successful. Their grading system ranges from select to prime depending on the amount of marbling and the color of the meat. One of the speakers discussed a blind study that aimed to see if consumers could taste the difference between select and choice beef, and they could. However, the consumers could not describe the difference in the grading categories, only that the choice beef was a better eating experience. One limitation to grading pork is the lack of technology that can grade at the speed of the line. Human grading is subjective and time consuming. Once the technology is available and standards (marbling, color, pH) are developed, the consumer should be informed as to what they mean and what are acceptable values. The consumers can tell the difference when they eat pork with more marbling and tenderness. Panelists in a recent taste test of Genesus pork gave better sensory scores (higher overall texture, juiciness, flavor, and overall opinion) for the meat with higher pH and intramuscular fat, two important measures of pork quality. With a grading system similar to that of the beef industry, consumers could relate choice or prime pork with a positive and consistent eating experience. Another issue that leads to a poor eating experience is cooking techniques. Many consumers still believe that pork should be cooked to 165 F (74 C) because of trichinosis. Modern swine production has almost eliminated the disease through production practices, i.e. the pigs are not reared outside and fed table scraps. According to the US Center for Disease Control (CDC), trichinosis has decreased from 400 cases per year in the 1940s to 20 cases per year in the 2000s. The current recommended cooking temperature for pork is 145 F, or 63 C (http://www.porkbeinspired.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/2924.pdf). As we have previously written, Genesus is dedicated to improving carcass and meat quality. Genesus pigs regularly meet Japan’s pork quality requirements, which has strict criteria for marbling, color, and pH. Once the North American market develops its own standards (currently being reevaluated and developed by the National Pork Board), Genesus customers will be able to collect premiums without changing their population structure or production practices. There appears to be a growing interest as an industry to improve pork quality. Now words need to be turned into action. References: "Trichinellosis Fact Sheet – Division of Parasitic Diseases".

(Judy Benson/The Day) Published December 23. 2016 11:59AM | Updated December 23. 2016 3:46PM By Judy Benson  Day staff writer j.benson@theday.com  BensonJudy Often after a family member dies, customers come to Simply Pharmacy or another local drug store to ask one of the pharmacists what to do with all their loved ones’ unused prescription medications. “A lot of people never throw stuff out,” Lisa Bragaw, clinical pharmacist at the Waterford store, said Thursday, describing medicine cabinets full of decades-old prescription vials. She and other local pharmacists have long been advising customers to bring the unused pills to medication drop boxes at local police departments. Or, they would hand them an instruction sheet describing steps for self-disposal: mix the unused portion with water or, if it’s a liquid, kitty litter, salt, coffee grounds, flour, charcoal or a powdered spice. The container should then be sealed with duct tape, placed inside a non-transparent bag and thrown in the trash. “We tell people one of the most important things is not to flush medication down the toilet,” said Phani Daggubati, pharmacy manager at Fort Hill Pharmacy in Groton. “And that they shouldn’t just keep it, because it can be easily abused.” Now, Daggubati, Bragaw and other pharmacists around the state have a new tool to help ensure that medications are disposed of properly. On Thursday, Gov. Dannel P. Malloy announced that 80,000 drug deactivation kits had been distributed free of charge to 600 pharmacies around the state, including Fort Hill and Simply Pharmacy, as well as CVS, Rite Aid, Walgreens, Wal-Mart, Stop & Shop, ShopRite and Big Y stores. The kits, in purple pouches about the size of a small tablet computer, were donated by the British-based company Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals and are now being given out for free to customers at the participating pharmacies. “Absolutely this is a good thing,” said Marghie Giuliano, executive vice president of the Connecticut Pharmacists Association. “It certainly raises awareness about the safe disposal of medications, and provides pharmacists with a new tool.” For years, she said, pharmacists have been telling customers not to flush drugs down the toilet, because municipal sewage treatment systems aren’t equipped to remove these substances from the waste stream, meaning residues end up being discharged into rivers and streams. In the past few years, though, with the worsening opioid crisis, proper drug disposal has taken on a new urgency. Getting unused drugs out of the house prevents them from being stolen and misused. Excess prescription opioids are “known to contribute to misuse, abuse and addiction,” according to a news release from Malloy. “These kits will allow Connecticut residents to safely dispose of these drugs at home without contaminating water sources or harming the environment,” the release said. Each kit can dispose of up to 45 pills or six ounces of liquid. The medications are placed inside the pouch, which contains charcoal. It is then filled halfway with warm water, and allowed to sit for 30 seconds. After that, it should be shaken gently and disposed of in the trash. “It’s very important to get drugs off the street, but also not to get it in the water supply,” Bragaw said. “This is small, and easy to use, and it’s free.” Simply Pharmacy has received about 250 of the packets, and Fort Hill Pharmacy has received about 65. Both say they’ve already given some away. Giuliano said the kits will be especially helpful for senior citizens, who may have difficulty bringing medications to a police department drop box or following the steps for proper self-disposal. “It can be a challenge for the elderly,” she said. j.benson@theday.com  More information: For locations of medication drop boxes, visit http://bit.ly/2hkNmNw. Any Connecticut pharmacy that has not received kits or would like to request additional ones should contact the state Department of Consumer Protection’s Drug Control Division at dcp.drugcontrol@ct.gov">dcp.drugcontrol@ct.gov or (860) 713-6065.

(Michael Goulding/The Orange County Register via AP, File) Holiday splurging not an option for many workers scraping by By Anne D'Innocenzio • AP Retail Writer Dec 23, 2016 (…) The Associated Press In this Sunday, Dec. 26, 2010, file photo, a shopper at the Brea Mall in Brea, Calif., carries bags full of packages. Amid the holiday decorations and cheerful ads, splurging is not an option for many Americans struggling to get by. (Michael Goulding/The Orange County Register via AP, File) ELIZABETH, N.J. • At the brightly lit mall, clothing stores highlight holiday sweaters and big signs tout the sales, while Duquan Allen keeps his expectations in check. Allen, who works full-time cleaning planes at Newark Airport, says his mother doesn't expect anything big, and he usually gets a hooded sweatshirt. He plans to spend about $150 on presents for his grandmother, mother and 21-year-old sister. "I'm good at budgeting," says Allen, who makes $10.10 an hour. Heading into this holiday season, with gas and food costs down, unemployment at its lowest point since 2007 and clothing prices on the decline, economists and retail executives declared it a great time to be a consumer. But seven years into the recovery, there's a stubborn divide that hourly workers see more starkly during the holidays, between themselves and better-off consumers who have benefited more as the economy improved. "I see people traveling. I wish I could afford it," said Allen. Many workers are indeed earning more. Average hourly earnings have picked up 2.5 percent over the past year, and major retailers have raised wages as competition for workers has increased. Thanksgiving weekend featured crowds of shoppers at stores and malls, snapping up new TVs and clothing. Luxury stores have promoted "feel-good" gifts like $1,000 silk pajamas. Americans spent $3.45 billion online on Cyber Monday, according to Adobe Digital Insights, and nearly that much on Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving. The National Retail Federation trade group expects holiday sales for the November and December period to rise 3.6 percent to $655.8 billion. From the data, people seem very able to buy. Overall, people plan to spend about $935 per person this holiday season, according to an NRF survey. Behind that figure, though, there's a split. Consumers with income under $50,000 plan to spend a little over $362 on gifts for their family and friends, while for those with income of $50,000 and higher, that number is about $768. Throwing in decorations, greeting cards, flowers and food, the difference is even larger — around $512, compared to about $1,020. That divide also hasn't budged since the recession. "The U.S. economy is not creating high-wage jobs for lower- and middle-income consumers," said Ken Perkins, president of research firm Retail Metrics LLC. "This is making it extremely difficult for lower-income consumers to make a living. There's really not a lot left for Santa Claus." About half of American workers have seen their share of overall income growth shrink since 1980, according to a recent study by economists Thomas Piketty, Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman. In 1980, the top 1 percent of adults earned on average 27 times more than the bottom 50 percent adults; now, they earn 81 times more. Workers at Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the nation's largest private employer, now earn an average of $13.38 an hour, while the average hourly pay for cashiers and low-level retail sales staff across the industry is $9.26, according to a Hay Group survey. But some groups say hourly employees across the board still don't make enough to live on. Their fight will face hurdles with President-elect Donald Trump's pick for labor secretary: fast-food CEO Andrew Puzder, who has been critical of minimum wage increases. "It's a scary-looking administration," said Scott Courtney, executive vice president of the Service Employees International Union. But he said the "Fight for $15" campaign that began with retail and restaurant workers is not giving up. "You are going to see a lot more opposition and a lot more people taking part." Besides the hourly wage, some workers say an issue is they can't get enough hours. The share of people working part-time because that's all they can get remains at recessionary low levels, according to research by Penn State professor and the University of Illinois' Project for Middle Class Renewal senior research analyst Lonnie Golden, published by the Economic Policy Institute. That level is nearly 45 percent higher than it was in 2008, fueled by a few industries like the retail sector. Who's hired?

"I wish I could shop for my mother, my grandmother and my sister," said Coates, who plans to spend $50 for the whole family. More than that, she'd like to be able to afford to study accounting. "What I really want is to go to school so I can get a better job." After rent and rising health care costs, some workers find there's not much left. Allen says of the $1,260 per month he takes home, more than half goes toward rent. After food, Wi-Fi, phone and utilities, he has about $310 per month for any other needs. He doesn't have health insurance and recently paid $100 to fix an abscessed tooth — the equivalent of about ten hours of work. "The real story for the economic pinch seems to be the rise in health insurance costs," said economist Michael P. Niemira, who examined 2015 data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and focused on the second-lowest income strata, which had an average pretax income of $28,343 — about $13.63 an hour for full-time work. Niemira, principal at The Retail Economist LLC, says health insurance costs as a share of pretax wages for that group were 15 percent in 2015, up from 8 percent in 2005. Other needs like rent are a bigger burden as well. For those in the income group Niemira examined, rent accounts for nearly 12 percent of pretax income, compared to less than 7 percent for all consumers, and just 2.7 percent for those in the highest 20 percent of income. In metropolitan areas like New York, it can be much, much higher. Mojisola Arogundade, who like Allen works at Newark for contractor PrimeFlight, says she saved about $250 since July to spend on presents for her six grandchildren. She's hoping to buy them clothes, but usually goes to thrift shops or local stores in Elizabeth, New Jersey, where she lives. "For a nightgown, I can get $2.99," says Arogundade. She rarely finds what she can afford at the mall: "I just come here for sightseeing." Business Briefing from St. Louis Post-Dispatch Make it your business.

Kissel of the Associated Press BENTONVILLE, Ark. — A Frank Lloyd Wright house that was flooded by Superstorm Sandy in New Jersey is high and dry in Arkansas. And it's getting thousands of visitors as part of the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art. The Bachman-Wilson House, originally located in Millstone, N.J., was one of Wright's famed Usonian homes. The architect created these small, simple structures for middle-class Americans, and about 60 were built. The Crystal Bridges Museum, founded by Wal-Mart heiress Alice Walton, had the home moved to Bentonville, Ark., where it was aligned on the same axis Wright used when laying out the building in 1954. More than 80,000 people have toured the Bachman-Wilson House in the past year. The home is presented as a retreat — a place to get away from it all without having to get away. "You're completely immersed in your natural environment," said Dylan Turk, a curatorial assistant at Crystal Bridges. "Wright's using materials that are American and comfortable — woods and natural materials — because he feels that is more connectible than steel, which is what other architects were using at that time." Wright desired an American identity among everyday homes and labeled his style "Usonian," for the "United States of North America." He wanted them to be affordable, and charged just $400 for the plans for the Bachman-Wilson House. The house cost about $30,000 to build. Wright actually never visited a Usonian home, Turk said. He was busy working on the Price Tower in Bartlesville, Okla., and the Guggenheim Museum in New York, when the Bachman-Wilson House was built. "Wright valued everything he designed, but he was also working on, at the time, The Guggenheim, which he thought would be his shining moment as an architect. He may have been a little preoccupied," Turk said. While it wasn't part of the Crystal Bridges' initial plan, the Wright-designed home fits in with the museum's concentration on art, architecture and nature, Turk said. Crystal Bridges architect Moshe Safdie sited the museum above Town Branch Creek. The Bachman-Wilson House overlooks Crystal Spring, a tributary well out of the flood plain. Students from the University of Arkansas' school of architecture, which is named after Wright protege Fay Jones, designed a welcome pavilion nearby. Wright, Jones and Safdie each won the American Institute of Architects' Gold Medal. "I wish I could have said I initiated the action to get the house, but I didn't," Safdie said. While he hasn't yet seen the Bachman-Wilson House in Arkansas, he said he was thrilled to hear about the acquisition and noted that he, Jones and Wright each now have an influence on the museum's grounds. "The trilogy has pleased me," he said. Before the house opened on a recent chilly morning, Turk sat down on the living room's low-slung bench, which abuts a cinder block wall designed as a barrier for the world outside. Across the room is a wall of glass, broken up by mahogany door frames and window frames cut in the shape of a maple tree's winged seed pod. The room faces southwest to catch the afternoon sun. "He wanted you to be as close to the ground as you possibly could be because he thought that grounded you," Turk said. "You're looking up. You can see the tops of the trees through the clerestory windows." A rust-colored floor, heated from beneath, extends beyond the glass. "He pioneered radiant heat in the United States. If you are outside on a cool night, you can feel your house," Turk said. "He wanted you to feel your house in as many ways as you possibly could." The Bachman-Wilson House flooded a number of times in New Jersey, most recently when Sandy hit in 2012. When its owners considered moving it to preserve it, Crystal Bridges said it would fit in with its mission. "Art is not just a painting that hangs on the wall," Turk said. "If you want to be creative, it doesn't have to be limited to a canvas. "This is familiar. It's a house," he said.
