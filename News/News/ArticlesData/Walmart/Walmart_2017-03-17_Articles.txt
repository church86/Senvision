KABC By ABC7.com staff Saturday, March 18, 2017 02:46PM VERNON, Calif. -- A Vernon company is issuing a recall of 21,000 pounds of frozen pizza sold at Walmart stores because of possible Listeria contamination. The 16-inch pizza made by RBR Meat Co. is sold as "Marketside Extra Large Supreme Pizza" with lot code 20547. Routine testing by the company revealed the presence of Listeria monocytogenes in pizza produced on Feb. 23, 2017, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. About 1,600 people are infected with listeriosis every year and of those 260 die, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Symptoms include fever, muscle aches, diarrhea and other gastrointestinal issues. The most vulnerable are pregnant women, newborns, older adults and people with weakened immune systems. The company said there have been no confirmed reports of illness. The pizza is sold at Walmart stores throughout the West Coast. Anyone who purchased the product is urged to throw it away or return it to the place of purchase. More information about the recall is available from the USDA here.

I'm doing a roundup on my YouTu… https://t.co/eGi7PdYot5 pic.twitter.com/qQD7a8CFEq — Noelle Downing (@NoelleBlog) June 20, 2016 The blog Jezebel noted that ModCloth employees were called in for meeting and told that their paychecks would soon be coming from Walmart. ModCloth’s is a women’s retailer known for celebrating size diversity. It is not uncommon to see ad campaigns for the clothing company featuring models of all sizes side by side. In 2015, the company announced on their style blog that they were officially retiring their plus size section stating, “we could all agree that shopping categories should be defined by types of clothing, not types of bodies.” For super cute swimsuits, shop @ModCloth and save 10% with your college discount! https://t.co/g5RsCPmspQ pic.twitter.com/AOAImqXkec — UNiDAYS US (@UNiDAYS_US) February 10, 2016 Through embracing body-positive practices, ModCloth quickly became a favorite of the curvy girl fashion movement that plus size millennials embraced on Instagram and Pinterest.

However, the company has been slowing purchasing smaller niche e-commerce brands such as footwear and accessories site ShoeBuy as part of an overall aggressive strategy to cut into Amazon’s stranglehold on retail. The Shoebuy purchase was made to compete with Amazon’s Zappos brand. Going somewhere? https://t.co/4MqSySx7bD pic.twitter.com/FjLwqxqXFp — ShoeBuy (@shoebuy) June 15, 2016 Walmart’s ModCloth buy goes after one of Amazon’s major weaknesses, which is a unique women’s apparel brand that appeals to a younger demographic. With featured companies such as Halston Heritage, Lacoste, and Calvin Klein, Amazon’s current catalog of women’s fashion tends to skew older and affluent. Walmart’s market strength has always been in providing inexpensive brands for people outside of metropolitan regions. The ModCloth buy broadens the reach of Walmart’s existing customer base. [Image by Gunnar Rathbun/AP Images] The sale of ModCloth comes at a time when the company is coming off of a widely-publicized downturn that had investors worried about its long-term prospects. Featured frequently on NBC’s The Today Show, ModCloth built its brand on the retro revivalism favored by celebrities such as Zooey Deschanel and Taylor Swift in the early years of her career. Founded in 2002, the Pittsburgh-based company was the brainchild of Susan Gregg Koger and Eric Koger. The pair, now based in Los Angeles, nurtured a company they started as Carnegie Mellon Students into what was thought to be a global success story with over $150 million in sales in 2014. However, there were signs that the company was struggling. Walmart kauft nach Shoebuy und Moosejaw auch Modcloth https://t.co/NrVcnBGReM pic.twitter.com/b2QVri7XHv — Exciting Commerce (@excomm) March 15, 2017 When Matt Kaness took over as ModCloth’s CEO in 2015, he had goals for massive expansion. According to Bloomberg, Kaness put into place sales initiatives to double ModCloth’s earnings potential. However, the company failed to meet those ambitious sales goals, and cracks began to appear in the once promising retailer’s veneer. Though the company had decent earnings, there were several setbacks which ultimately led to the Walmart deal. As TechCrunch reported, ModCloth laid off nearly 15 percent of its employees in 2014. The company has also had to deal with a changing aesthetic in millennial fashion, which is embracing a different kind of retro with the nineties inspired pastels and grunge apparel. 90's fashion that is trendy right now on the blog. https://t.co/42hJZoxGOc pic.twitter.com/15rMW2tVRS — Mode By Cece (@ModebyCeCe) March 3, 2017 ModCloth’s vintage-style aesthetic may not provide the most trendy clothing in the marketplace; however, they remain a staple for many young women due to their innovative advertising strategy which incorporates real-life customers into its marketing. For instance, ModCloth’s website features a modern style gallery where consumers can upload pictures of their outfits.

For many, news that the body-positive ModCloth would be joining Jet.Com is a sign that the indie clothing line has sold out by embracing a corporate brand. Indeed, as news spread of the sale, ModCloth’s loyal customers began expressing their displeasure online.

(@kiersi) March 18, 2017 As an online backlash builds against both ModCloth and Walmart, it remains to be seen if there will be any impact on sales. To get ahead of a potential boycott, ModCloth co-founder Susan Gregg Koger released a statement reaffirming that the clothing company would retain their current website in addition to appearing on Jet.com.

We have about $285,000 in stocks plus a $122,000 annuity we just bought from our stockbroker. We hope to retire in 10 years and then work just part time. Now we are looking for income and growth. We own 146 shares of Costco, which we bought at $43 in 2005, and have reinvested all the dividends — which have increased each year, so each year, I get more shares. We do this with all our stocks, which is what you recommended to us years ago. Unfortunately, Costco yields only 1 percent. Because we’re now looking for more income, our broker wants us to sell Costco (I have a large tax-loss carryforward in two other stocks our broker sold us) and buy Wal-Mart because it yields 2.9 percent. Wal-Mart also has a good record of dividend and profit growth. This would triple our income, and we would stay in the same investment sector, which makes good sense to us. My wife and I would appreciate your opinion and good advice. — L.L., Fort Lauderdale, Fla. Dear L.L.: Jumpin’ Jehoshaphat, that stockbroker has cracker crumbs on his brain and is dangerous to your wealth. If his annuity recommendation is as bad as his stock recommendation, then you folks are in big trouble. Fire this cad before he gives you any more stinking advice. As certain as the sun will shine somewhere in the world today, that sleazeball has given you the worst possible stock advice. I strongly recommend that you get your account reviewed by a knowledgeable, wise and experienced professional whom you can trust. There are some highly qualified brokers in your area, so I suggest that you ask your accountant or one of the lawyers you work with for a couple of names. And after your interviews, if you come back to me with their recommendations, I will help you select the right professional to help you and your spouse meet your retirement goals. Meanwhile, don’t you dare sell Costco. Costco (COST-$164), with 505 wholesale membership warehouses in the U.S. — plus 91 in Canada, 36 in Mexico, 28 in the United Kingdom, 12 in South Korea, 12 in Taiwan and eight in Australia — is one of the finest mega-retailers in the world. Because less than 25 percent of its merchandise is imported, COST is well-insulated from potential changes in the tax code, if Congress has the guts to follow through with trade tariffs. (Some 68 percent of Wal-Mart’s merchandise is imported.) Membership trends continue to be solid. The 89 percent renewal rate is the best in the industry, and based on the successes of prior increases, I suspect that management will hike its membership fee later this year. It takes about seven or eight quarters for such a fee hike to be fully felt on the income statement, and a small hike would add importantly to COST’s bottom line. Based on past performance, I’d prefer being an owner of COST over being an owner of Wal-Mart (WMT-$71) stock, which has basically acted like flotsam and jetsam for the past dozen years. COST’s net profit margins of 4 percent are 35 percent higher than WMT’s 2.7 percent, and certainly COST’s sweet stock performance — a fourfold increase in the past dozen years — must be the envy of the WMT boys in Bentonville. The companies sell similar products, but Wall Street believes that COST does it better. And indeed it does. COST’s 218,000 employees generated $120 billion in revenues last year, creating $2.6 billion in net income, which translates to $18,000 net profit per employee. Meanwhile, WMT’s 2.3 million employees put $500 billion in revenues on the books last year, producing $13.5 billion in net income, or $6,000 net profit per employee. So COST’s employees take home bigger paychecks and better retirement benefits than all those at WMT. Argus Research, Thomson Reuters, Market Edge and Merrill Lynch have “hold” recommendations on WMT and “buy” recommendations on COST. Malcolm Berko addresses questions about stocks. Reach him at P.O.

The company declined to specify the price on the deal that closed Friday, saying only that it was in the same range as its previous two purchases of online businesses. Those were $51 million and $70 million. Wal-Mart is working hard to attract younger and more affluent shoppers, but winning over ModCloth's devoted customers, fans of its vintage-inspired patterned dresses, inclusive sizing and community feel, may be a challenge. Many expressed their disappointment on social media when they heard talk of a deal with Wal-Mart. Bentonville, Arkansas-based Wal-Mart said ModCloth will continue to operate as a stand-alone and complementary brand to its other e-commerce sites, and will bring experience and talent to strengthening the company's fashion business aimed at millennials. Independent designers who sell on ModCloth's site, it said, will gain the opportunity to expand their reach. ModCloth CEO Matthew Kaness, his executive team and the company's 300-plus employees will stay based in San Francisco, Los Angeles and Pittsburgh, and will join Wal-Mart's U.S. e-commerce retail organization. Wal-Mart spent more than $3 billion for upstart Jet.com last year and since then has purchased other smaller companies, including online footwear retailer ShoeBuy.com and the outdoor gear seller Moosejaw. Marc Lore, the founder of Jet.com who is now CEO of Walmart.com, said last month that the company was still looking for new startups to buy.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars COMMERCE Walmart could soon use drones to deliver purchases Jonathan Vanian, Fortune@JonathanVanian March 17, 2017 7:30 PM Tags: drone, drone delivery, patent, Walmart, Walmart News Walmart may use drones like in-store messenger pigeons. The retail giant was granted a patent this week for a system in which drones would shuttle products between different departments inside its stores. The idea is to free customers from having to walk across its super-sized emporiums to find what they want and from having to wait while employees return from far-away storerooms. Ultimately, Walmart believes that drones “can greatly improve the customer experience without overburdening the human associates of the facility.” Waiting, the filing said, “can contribute to reduced customer satisfaction.” The drones would mostly avoid buzzing above customers’ heads by being routed over shelves instead of store aisles, according to the patent filing. But the filing did leave the door open to humans and flying delivery assistants crossing paths. Although flying drones over people’s heads may not be a safety risk, steering clear of customers may “nevertheless provide an increased feeling of security for those below,” the filing said. Of course, Walmart’s new patent is no guarantee that it will use drones. Companies file patents all the time, and not every one of them is put into use. Fortune contacted Walmart for more information and will update this story if it responds. As part of the drone delivery system, each store would have a computer system that would function as automated air traffic control for dispatching drones and deciding their flight paths. Sensors on the drones would help them avoid obstacles. Several drone landing zones would be created in stores, some of which would be in plain sight of customers while others may be hidden from view. Drones may uses nets or hooks to grab and carry items, depending on the product’s shape and weight. If needed, employees would attach items to drones after getting specific instructions through text messages or through an app. Above: Walmart drone delivery patent Image Credit: Fortune Walmart’s proposed drone delivery system is different from other high-profile drone delivery projects by the likes of Amazon, Google parent company Alphabet, and UPS. Those initiatives involve drones delivering goods to people’s homes, but drone experts generally say that such delivery systems are years away because of factors like federal regulations, limited drone battery life, and the high cost of larger drones that are capable of traveling long distances. A recent Gartner report said that businesses could start using drones to deliver goods within their own facilities, something akin to what Walmart is proposing. Additionally, a business that operates in a large office park could use drones to distribute packages like pneumatic tube systems used years ago for inter-office mail, Gartner analyst Gerald Van Hoy told Fortune in February.

The company declined to specify the price on the deal that closed Friday, saying only that it was in the same range as its previous two purchases of online businesses. Those were $51 million and $70 million. Walmart is working hard to attract younger and more affluent shoppers, but winning over ModCloth’s devoted customers, fans of its vintage-inspired patterned dresses, inclusive sizing and community feel, may be a challenge. Many expressed their disappointment on social media when they heard talk of a deal with Walmart. Walmart said ModCloth will continue to operate as a stand-alone and complementary brand to its other e-commerce sites, and will bring experience and talent to strengthening the company’s fashion business aimed at Millennials. Independent designers who sell on ModCloth’s site, it said, will gain the opportunity to expand their reach. ModCloth CEO Matthew Kaness, his executive team and the company’s 300-plus employees will stay based in San Francisco, Los Angeles and Pittsburgh, and will join Walmart’s U.S. e-commerce retail organization. Walmart spent more than $3 billion for upstart Jet.com last year and since then has purchased other smaller companies, including online footwear retailer ShoeBuy.com and the outdoor gear seller Moosejaw. Marc Lore, the founder of Jet.com, is now CEO of Walmart.com, which has headquarters in San Bruno. He said last month that the company is still looking for new startups to buy. ModCloth, founded in 2002, has one physical store in Austin, Texas. Latest from the SFGATE homepage: Click below for the top news from around the Bay Area and beyond.

KABC By ABC7.com staff Friday, March 17, 2017 04:25PM VERNON, Calif. (KABC) -- A Vernon company is issuing a recall of 21,000 pounds of frozen pizza sold at Walmart stores because of possible Listeria contamination. The 16-inch pizza made by RBR Meat Co. is sold as "Marketside Extra Large Supreme Pizza" with lot code 20547. Routine testing by the company revealed the presence of Listeria monocytogenes in pizza produced on Feb. 23, 2017, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. About 1,600 people are infected with listeriosis every year and of those 260 die, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Symptoms include fever, muscle aches, diarrhea and other gastrointestinal issues. The most vulnerable are pregnant women, newborns, older adults and people with weakened immune systems. The company said there have been no confirmed reports of illness. The pizza is sold at Walmart stores throughout the West Coast. Anyone who purchased the product is urged to throw it away or return it to the place of purchase. More information about the recall is available from the USDA here.

Login Search Wal-Mart (WMT) Recalls Frozen Pizzas on Contamination Risk March 17, 2017, 05:25:00 PM EDT By Zacks Equity Research, Zacks.com Shutterstock photo Retail giant Wal-Mart Stores Inc . WMT announced that it is recalling its most popular frozen pizzas on the grounds of contamination risk with listeria, per Reuters. The issue was discovered during a sample test conducted by the manufacturer RBR Meat Company, which makes these Marketside Extra Large Supreme 16-inch pizzas and sells exclusively to Wal-Mart. As per media reports, The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) has found that about 21,000 pounds of the frozen pizza products might be contaminated with L. monocytogenes bacteria. These bacteria can cause infection that can be fatal for senior citizens, pregnant women, and people with weaker immune systems. High fever, stiffness, and nausea are some of the common symptoms of the contamination. The FSIS has warned customers against the purchase of frozen pizzas, although no cases of indisposition have been reported yet. Wal-Mart has always remained under media's scrutiny due to the size and scale of operations. In the past, it had to face criticism for issues such as labor disputes and breach of food safety measures in China. Wal-Mart is also facing bribery allegations and lobbying charges in China, India and Brazil. All these issues not only raises expense burden, but also adversely impacts the company's business practices. Despite a number of potential headwinds, share price of Wal-Mart has been rising as the company remains focused on building its e-commerce capabilities, foraying into new markets, expanding product assortments and implementing innovative ways to drive traffic. Wal-Mart Stores has increased in comparison to the index since the past one year. We note that in the said period, the stock gained 4.4%, in comparison to the Zacks categorized Retail-Supermarkets industry's growth of just 0.2%. Further, the company delivered positive earnings surprises in the past six consecutive quarters. In fact, recently, analysts of Bank of America and Merrill Lynch have shown optimism in Wal-Mart's valuation. The analysts foresee much potential in the stock owing to the recently reported robust fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results. This can be attributed to the company's strong same-store sales and growing e-commerce business. Despite having a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), Wal-Mart carries a VGM score of 'A', and a Value and Growth score of 'A.' This indicates that there is substantial potential in the stock. Higher Comps Wal-Mart reported higher comparable store sales (comps) in fourth-quarter fiscal 2017, wherein earnings and revenues exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company's Wal-Mart U.S. same-store sales beat estimates by 1.8% amid a challenging environment that saw many retailers report negative same-store sales. Investments in e-commerce Business Wal-Mart is making huge investments in e-commerce to compete better with brick-and-mortar rivals as well as Amazon.com Inc. AMZN . These efforts are also aimed at growing the company's hold in the online business. In this regard, Wal-Mart is executing acquisitions that provide access to more upscale customers and new technologies. Further, the company continued to forge ahead with its Walmart.com initiatives, with offers like free two-day shipping on purchases of $35 or more for over 2 million items, which could earlier be availed for a membership fee of $50. Wal-Mart also expects to expand its online grocery pickup - Walmart Grocery - from the current 600 to roughly 1,200 stores in fiscal 2018. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.

Courtesy of ModCloth ModCloth founder Susan Gregg Koger: By Stephanie Ritenbaugh / Pittsburgh Post-Gazette ModCloth, an independent online clothing retailer with roots in Pittsburgh, and Arkansas-based behemoth Walmart have confirmed that the two unlikely partners have tied the knot. Modcloth has been acquired by e-commerce company Jet.com, which is owned by Walmart, in an all-cash deal. Neither company would disclose the price tag for the deal, which closed Friday, but said it was along the same lines as Walmart’s two recent acquisitions. Walmart bought online footwear retailer ShoeBuy.com for $70 million and the outdoor and gear seller Moosejaw for $51 million. The company, an indie-darling known for vintage and quirky styles was founded in Pittsburgh in 2002 and later moved its headquarters to San Francisco. It has 350 employees across offices in San Francisco, Los Angeles and Pittsburgh. “All three Modcloth offices will stay intact,” said Aire Plichta Reese, a Modcloth spokeswoman. Like many retailers, Walmart has been fighting for a stake in online sales. Last year, it paid more than $3 billion for Jet.com, which Walmart said would “infuse Walmart with fresh ideas and expertise, as well as an attractive brand with proven appeal, especially with millennials, the first generation of true digital natives.” Since then, the company has bought two other online retailers. A Walmart spokesman described the deal as Modcloth “joining our U.S. e-commerce organization (alongside Jet, Shoebuy, Moosejaw and Walmart.com).” In a blog post on Friday, Susan Gregg Koger said the deal “will give us the necessary resources and support that we need as a business to grow. Growth allows us to reach more women, grow our community, and amplify our message.” Ms. Gregg Koger created the company in 2002 with fellow Carnegie Mellon University Eric Koger. “And we can open more stores — in your hometown!,” she continued. The digital-native retailer, which targets women between 18 and 35, has been touched by the overall downturn in retail and undergone rounds of layoffs. ModCloth had been breaking into the brick-and-mortar space with its ModCloth IRL (in real life) Tour, with temporary storefronts set up in cities around the country. The tour included a stop in its hometown of Pittsburgh in September. ModCloth also operates one physical store in Austin, Texas.

By Natalie Gagliordi for Between the Lines | March 17, 2017 -- 20:09 GMT (13:09 PDT) | Topic: E-Commerce Modcloth was founded in 2002 in Pittsburgh by Susan Koger. Walmart is buying Modcloth, an online retailer known for its vintage and geek-chic inspired fashion designed to fit a range of female body types. Financial terms were not disclosed, but Walmart said it acquired Modcloth's assets and operations and that the deal has already closed. what's hot on zdnet After liftoff, Samsung's Galaxy S8 will face many unknowns Feature or flaw? How to hijack a Windows account in less than a minute Five biotech inventions the US is not ready for IBM launches blockchain as a service for the enterprise Modcloth was founded in 2002 in Pittsburgh by Susan Koger, then a student at Carnegie Mellon University. The brand earned a cult following for its range of quirky apparel and accessories and eventually expanded operations to include three offices across the country. In a blog post, Koger cited recent layoffs within Modcloth and challenges in the industry as reasons behind the deal, saying it would give the company "the necessary resources and support that we need as a business to grow." In a separate post on Facebook, Koger lamented the backlash she's received since news of the deal leaked on Jezebel earlier in the week and pointed out that she's not profiting off of the sale. "I am incredibly proud of my time at ModCloth," Koger wrote. "I'm also filled with regret. We did a lot of things right but also made tons of mistakes. No one, in life or business, is perfect. To those who are calling me a 'sell out', or worse, please know this: I'm not making any profit on this sale. I haven't had a controlling stake in the business for years. And this was the only way forward that allowed ModCloth to continue to exist. Trust me, it's a good thing." As for Walmart, the retail giant said that ModCloth CEO Matthew Kaness, his executive team, and ModCloth's 300-plus employees will continue to be based in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Pittsburgh. ModCloth and its website will operate as a standalone yet "complementary" brand to Walmart's other ecommerce sites. Officially the company will join Walmart's US ecommerce business, giving Modcloth access to Walmart's deep financial coffers and logistics resources. For designers that sell on Modcloth, Walmart is pitching the deal as a way to expand their consumer reach through Jet.com and its other ecommerce sites. In the end, Walmart is hoping to capitalize on Modcloth's strong social media presence, diverse product line and close customer relationships as it looks to expand its reach with new audiences. What's unclear is whether Modcloth's legion of devoted shoppers will stick around with Walmart at the helm.

Postal Connections Express™ will be located directly next to the east entry into the Walmart SuperCenter. “The joint business arrangement represents a tremendous commitment to customer service and satisfaction by both brands,” said Pete Pierce, who has owned the local Postal Connections in Bend at 2660 NE Highway 20 since 1998. “The world’s largest retailer is seeking to improve convenience for its customers. At Postal Connections, we are constantly evolving our business to ensure that customers are receiving top-notch services that make their lives easier.” The Postal Connections stores within the giant retailer will offer convenient access to postal products, shipping with the leading carriers, freight, printing, creative services, copying, fax, passport photos, notary, shredding and other services.

It's official. Wal-Mart on Friday confirmed that it has acquired ModCloth, a specialty online apparel retailer that caters to curvy women. The announcement comes two days after a report by fashion blog Jezebel said a deal between the two was imminent. It also marks Wal-Mart's fourth digital acquisition since September, when it closed its $3.3 billion purchase of Jet.com. The company did not disclose the price it paid for ModCloth. However, a spokesman said it was "along the same lines" of the previous two companies Wal-Mart snatched up. Wal-Mart purchased Shoebuy for $70 million in December. And last month, it bought outdoor apparel retailer Moosejaw for $51 million. "Assortment is driving a lot of these acquisitions," CEO Doug McMillon said at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Consumer & Retail Technology Conference Tuesday, before any mention of ModCloth had been made. "We can pick up some of these companies that are great in terms of the assortment and the service they provide, but they don't have enough money to lose, to go market their brand and scale it." ModCloth will continue to operate its own website as a standalone and complementary brand, Wal-Mart said. The company noted that apparel and accessories are the No. 1 category for online shopping, and the ModCloth acquisition positions it to "gain the experience of a well-recognized specialty apparel e-commerce brand that's trusted by millions of millennial women." However, not all of those shoppers were thrilled. Some women took to Twitter to voice their disappointment with the deal, which they said takes away the independent vibe ModCloth has built its name on. Tweet Tweet Founded in 2002, Modcloth is headquartered in San Francisco and employs roughly 300 workers. Krystina GustafsonEditor Related Securities Symbol Price   Change %Change WMT ---

Fire officials said a fire left the home the family shared on Dogwood Lane in Glen Carbon a total loss. The seven children of Cristy and Justin Campbell lost their home in the fire. The Walmart in Glen Carbon where the children ran to escape the fire is accepting donations Friday, said assistant manager, Melinda Maple. The children's sizes and ages are as follows: Boy, age 14; eighth grade; shoe and socks size 9; pants and shirt size 14 to 16 Boy, age 13; seventh grade; shoe and sock size 7 1/2; pants size 12 shirt size 12 to 14 Girl, age 11; fifth grade; shoes size 5; pants and shirt size 10 to 12 Boy, age 8; second grade; shoes size 2; pants and shirt sizes 7 and 8 Girl, age 7; first grade; shoe size 13; pants and shirt sizes 4 to 5 Boy, age 4; shoe size 10; pants and shirt size 4 to 5 Infant, age 3 months; shoe size 6 to 9 months; pants and shirt three to six months A list of the children's sizes will be distributed at the door to Walmart, and any monetary donations or toiletries are being kept in the personnel office, Maple said. "A lot of our associates are raising donations," she said. "They are volunteering to stand outside and take donations as well. It's in our community and we want to stick together." Walmart workers plan to deliver the goods to the Tiger Country Building behind Edwardsville High School between 6 and 8 p.m. Friday. Clothing, shoes, toys and cash donations will be accepted there, and, depending on the amount that is received, volunteers may establish a college fund for the children, according to organizers with the Little Tigers Football team and Edwardsville Wrestling Club. Checks should be made payable to Little Tigers Football. To donate online visit https://squareup.com/store/edwardsville-little-tigers-football or for more information call 314-705-0164.

Fire officials said a fire left the home the family shared on Dogwood Lane in Glen Carbon a total loss. The seven children of Cristy and Justin Campbell lost their home in the fire. The Walmart in Glen Carbon where the children ran to escape the fire is accepting donations Friday, said assistant manager, Melinda Maple. The children's sizes and ages are as follows: Boy, age 14; eighth grade; shoe and socks size 9; pants and shirt size 14 to 16 Boy, age 13; seventh grade; shoe and sock size 7 1/2; pants size 12 shirt size 12 to 14 Girl, age 11; fifth grade; shoes size 5; pants and shirt size 10 to 12 Boy, age 8; second grade; shoes size 2; pants and shirt sizes 7 and 8 Girl, age 7; first grade; shoe size 13; pants and shirt sizes 4 to 5 Boy, age 4; shoe size 10; pants and shirt size 4 to 5 Infant, age 3 months; shoe size 6 to 9 months; pants and shirt three to six months A list of the children's sizes will be distributed at the door to Walmart, and any monetary donations or toiletries are being kept in the personnel office, Maple said. "A lot of our associates are raising donations," she said. "They are volunteering to stand outside and take donations as well. It's in our community and we want to stick together." Walmart workers plan to deliver the goods to the Tiger Country Building behind Edwardsville High School between 6 and 8 p.m. Friday. Clothing, shoes, toys and cash donations will be accepted there, and, depending on the amount that is received, volunteers may establish a college fund for the children, according to organizers with the Little Tigers Football team and Edwardsville Wrestling Club.

To date, no reports of listeria food poisoning have been linked to the recalled pizza. The Walmart supreme frozen pizzas are being recalled due to the potential that the products may be contaminated with listeria monocytogens, a foodborne bacteria that may cause serious and sometimes fatal infections among those with weakened immune systems, such as children, the elderly and pregnant women. Included in the recall are 50.6 ounce Marketside Extra Large Supreme Pizzas, which were sold in corrugated boxes containing 1 shrink wrapped 16-inch pizza. The pizza boxes are marked with lot code 20547 and are marked with the establishment number “EST. 1821” inside the USDA mark of inspection. The recalled pizzas were manufactured by RBR Meat Company Inc., of Vernon, California on February 23, 2017. They were shipped to Walmart distribution centers in California, Nevada, Utah and Washington. According to the recall, an estimated 21,220 pounds of the frozen pizza products are included in the recall. Listerosis is a foodborne illness that can cause serious health consequences and death, especially for children, the elderly and those with weakened immune systems. The infection is considered by the FDA as one of the more dangerous foodborne illnesses, frequently resulting in hospitalizations and has a 25% fatality rate. Symptoms of listeria infections may include nausea, muscle ache, diarrhea, fever, and fatigue. In severe cases for the elderly and young children, the bacteria could spread through the bloodstream to the nervous system resulting in sometimes fatal infections. For pregnant women, listerosis can pose a risk of miscarriages, still births, premature delivery or life-threatening infection of the newborn. Customers with recalled supreme frozen pizzas are being asked to stop consuming them immediately and to either discard the products or return them to their place of purchase. Customers with furthers questions should contact Eunice Wu, QA Director, of RBR Meat Company, at 323-826-2144 Ext. 190.

Chances are, you have, too. Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon.com, has infiltrated every corner of my day. Before I leave the house, I holler at Amazon’s voice-activated personal assistant, Alexa, who tells me the news and weather and the fastest way to work. Advertisement No matter when I arrive at the office, at Harvard Business Review, Bezos is already there in spirit. Our website at work is housed in the cloud thanks to Amazon Web Services, a.k.a. AWS. Our press sells books through Amazon.com. I’ve even started testing a new video conferencing service called Chime, built by no other than Amazon. Around lunchtime, when I stop to check the news on Facebook, more and more of it comes from The Washington Post — which Bezos owns.

View Story Amazon in hunt for Boston offices The tech and retail giant is looking to lease 100,000 to 200,000 square feet of office space in downtown Boston. Amazon founder Bezos to buy Washington Post You get the point. If my Bezos-ification has reached these depths, how far gone will I be a year from now? Even as I was talking with a Globe editor about this very piece, Alexa kept interrupting me: “Hmm, I can’t seem to answer your question.” I’m not alone in this Bezos bubble. As the prolific entrepreneur has plowed cash into everything from the Post to virtual grocery stores, along with the physical and virtual infrastructure to zoom it all to your door, we’ve become captive Bezos consumers, relying increasingly upon his technology to anticipate what we’ll want to watch, gift, like, and wear. Advertisement His empire now threatens big name companies as diverse as The New York Times and Walmart. And the list of rivals keeps expanding. Amazon has gone head to head with Hulu, Netflix, and HBO with original television and movie production. When the rapacious company announced that it needed to increase shipping capacity, UPS and FedEx were quickly put on high alert. There seems to be no limit to Bezos’s desire to grow — his space-exploration company, Blue Origin, envisions Amazon-style delivery to the moon — and that means that countless other companies may no doubt find themselves in Amazon’s crosshairs. As his empire and his ambitions swell, Bezos looks like a new kind of competitor on the global scene: someone with essentially bottomless pockets, an ever-expanding cache of data, and a willingness to keep investing in insurgent businesses until the rest of the world recognizes the value in them. Ironically, in an economy fixated on short-term results, exceptional patience pays off. Massive growth was always Bezos’s plan. When he left Wall Street for Seattle in 1994 to start selling books online, Bezos famously chose the name “Amazon” because he wanted to connote the exotic and gigantic. Books were always just a gateway to his mega-retailing ambitions, and he was unrelenting with his growth strategy: invest in the brand and steal market share at any cost. In many ways, Amazon was an anti-Walmart. Bezos focused on expanding his customer base and never seemed to make a dime. Walmart, on the other hand, scrimped together lots of dimes to make its profit. But eventually Bezos’s philosophy won out. He’s now worth about $71 billion, putting him in the top five of the Forbes billionaires club. Bezos is using his ample capital to fund ever new and more daring ventures and innovations. Not everything is a huge success — to wit, the Kindle Fire tablet device never blazed much in sales. But missteps don’t stop Amazon from launching new efforts like the Echo and its personal assistant, Alexa, which was a huge hit this past holiday season. More surprising was his push into the newspaper business. Bezos purchased the Post for about $250 million from Don Graham, the scion of Katharine Graham, who had built the paper into a powerhouse during the 1970s and ’80s. By 2013, when Bezos scooped up the paper, it had been ravaged by an ever-receding print advertising market. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Jeff Bezos conducts a “digital ribbon cutting” during the opening ceremony of the Washington Post’s new headquarters on January 28, 2016. Bezos went right to work running his same old plays: He invested in the brand and began undercutting and outmaneuvering the competition. Despite its national profile, the Post was still a local D.C. paper. But now, thanks to Bezos, it has become a global player, competing in a different league for readers and ad dollars. The early signs show that the approach just might be working. The Post is expanding its footprint at a ferocious pace. While it’s a private company and not required to report its numbers, the Post has claimed more than 80 million unique visitors per month, and says that it’s seen massive growth of online subscriptions. From the outside, it looks like something rare: a growing newspaper. All of this has clearly caught the attention of the top brass at The New York Times. Rivalries between big media companies are nothing new. But what makes this one so intriguing is that Bezos is an interloper who is leveraging his tech background to catapult the Post onto a global stage. Bezos’s approach has a big advantage in the world of newspapers — most of which are struggling to pay reporters and photographers, let alone duke it out for developers on par with a Facebook or Google. But Bezos can, in fact, afford both, and he has the fortitude to try new things that might rankle industry stalwarts. Last year, the Post launched Heliograf, an artificial-intelligence engine that can create stories with just a little help (today) from human editors. The new technology, which was piloted with the Rio Olympics, allows an editor to create a template that the computer then fills out using data from digital sources. The outcome is that the Post can create a vast sea of stories and push them out digitally, offering news on a local, national, and international level. In an interview with Wired, chief information officer Shailesh Prakash described the Post’s approach like this: “It’s the Bezos concept of the Everything Store.” The Post has been aggressive in its use of Facebook Instant Articles, a format that the social-networking giant promotes to reduce download times. Other publishers have stood on the sidelines, fearful of giving away their content to yet another digital behemoth, but under Bezos the Post can afford to take more risks. As it seeks to expand its reach in the Donald Trump era, the Post has also positioned itself as the paper of resistance and adopted a stark new slogan — “Democracy Dies in Darkness.” It’s too early to say if Bezos’s approach at the Post will succeed, but his long-term (really long-term) investment strategy is striking. Bezos’s most insidious products, however, might be the ones you don’t see. Amazon Web Services owns about 45 percent of the market for cloud computing — the remote servers that host websites and store and process data on behalf of client companies. Amazon’s share of this vast and growing industry is larger than those of Google, IBM, and Microsoft combined. To limit its reliance on Amazon, Apple recently moved some of its cloud storage off AWS to its smartphone rival Google. Cloud services are important because they hold the key to how all of our devices will be interconnected one day. Here, again, Bezos is playing the long game, accumulating key puzzle pieces that may form a picture of dominance one day in the future. While Alexa may seem like a novelty at first, the code behind it is impressive, and Amazon is making it available for use by other companies. Ford, for example, plans to embed Alexa into car operating systems. (If so, maybe voice-enabled commands will actually work.) Variations of the Amazon story are playing out around the world. Bezos has been battling for years in markets like India — where an upstart player called FlipKart took an early lead in e-commerce, only to watch it erode over time because of Amazon’s persistence and deep pockets. So, it would seem we are heading for total Bezos-ification. Imagine riding around town in your self-driving vehicle, and hearing Post stories served through the cloud and read by Alexa, who will also have your favorite movies and television shows — all courtesy of Amazon. If you’ve forgotten an important anniversary, don’t worry: Alexa will have flowers delivered by drone to that special someone before you even make it home. Bezos-ification sure is convenient. It’s also influenced the business world in powerful ways. When a company like Snap warns, on the cusp of a multibillion-dollar public offering, that it may never turn a profit, its founders are echoing Jeff Bezos. Companies like Uber and Airbnb are following in Bezos’s footsteps, too, as they burn through cash to make their brands into household names. Can they sustain it? And can Bezos? While the Amazon Echo was a hit for sure, many of these new holiday purchases were promptly returned as fearful consumers worried about Amazon listening in on their conversations. On privacy matters, Bezos and his fellow tech entrepreneurs are encountering real resistance, especially in Europe, which has been clamping down on tech companies for some time now. The United States might follow suit — yes, even in the pro-business, antiregulation Trump era. Another challenge might be one of focus. Bezos’s empire is already sprawling, and he’s now taking on even further-flung pursuits like space travel. Still, back here on Earth, people like me will keep getting more Bezos-ified by the day. What’s next? Will his package-delivering drones eventually soar? Will his Amazon delivery trucks be self-driving? Will his artificial-intelligence bots tell us what to buy? Will he construct a virtual Amazon world for 24/7 shopping? If you’re not quite ready to sign up for this level of Bezos-ification, that’s perfectly fine. Bezos can wait.

 Walmart ramps up e-commerce with two new initiatives BI Intelligence Mar. 17, 2017, 11:43 AM 1,778 facebook linkedin twitter email print BI Intelligence See Also Walmart's e-commerce sales soared in its latest quarter Amazon has brought Prime to Mexico Amazon would fare better than legacy retailers under a US import tax This story was delivered to BI Intelligence "E-Commerce Briefing" subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here. Walmart has been actively expanding its efforts to boost its e-commerce operations recently, as the company looks to better compete with online retail giant Amazon. And this week, it announced two new initiatives to that end:  Its subsidiary, Jet.com, will acquire ModCloth — a bohemian vintage clothing brand selling primarily online, as reported by Jezebel. In addition, it plans to invest 17 billion pesos ($863 million) in Walmart de Mexico in 2017, according to The Wall Street Journal. This is an increase of 19% from last year's investment in the Mexican business unit, commonly referred to as Walmex, and the retail giant plans to allocate 23% of the budget to logistics and e-commerce.  ModCloth is Walmart’s third acquisition in 2017 aimed at building its e-commerce presence among millennials. ModCloth’s customer base is made up of mostly millennial women, which could help Walmart increase engagement beyond its typically older clientele. Walmart also just bought Moosejaw, an outdoor apparel and gear retailer with a strong millennial following and online presence, for $51 million in February. And at the beginning of 2017, it acquired e-commerce shoe retailer ShoeBuy for $70 million. Moreover, apparel is the top retail category in terms of online sales, and currently dominated by Amazon. Walmart is likely positioning itself in a high-growth segment, with a customer base known for online shopping, to fight growing competition from the e-commerce titan. Meanwhile, the company's increased investment in Walmex signals it's fighting to keep its market share as Amazon expands in Mexico. Indeed, this announcement comes a little more than a week after Amazon announced it's bringing its Prime subscription service to the country. Walmart and Amazon each have a 5.5% share of the e-commerce market in Mexico, but with Amazon Prime entering the space, Walmart may lose customers due to Prime’s free and fast shipping. As Walmart stated in December, it plans to build out its logistics network by adding more distribution centers in Mexico and upgrading its existing ones. And although it didn’t specify which e-commerce initiatives it had planned, it could utilize its physical locations to provide ways for shoppers to pay in cash for online purchases, similar to the service MercadoLibre provides through Occo convenience stores. Reaching Mexico’s largely unbanked population will be key for any e-commerce player in that market. Although there is a huge gap between Walmart and Amazon in terms of online sales, the retail giant still overshadows Amazon in total revenue, and it can leverage its enormous amount of capital to build a strong online presence quickly. Amazon’s online sales were $92 billion last year, while Walmart had an estimated $13.7 billion in 2015. However, Walmart reported total revenue of $486 billion in 2016, compared with the $136 billion Amazon generated. Walmart is clearly leveraging this advantage, as its been making acquisitions at a breakneck pace, and quickly increasing its investment in markets where it directly competes with Amazon. BI Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, has compiled a detailed report on new e-commerce strategies that looks at some of the top trends affecting retailers at each stage of the purchase funnel and how they're responding to those shifts. Here are some of the key takeaways: Within digital, consumers are spreading out their retail purchasing across channels, forcing retailers to spread out their online marketing budgets. Paid search, affiliate marketing, and email all increased their share of e-commerce referrals last year, according to Custora. Paid search especially stood out as a major source of spending by retailers. Search ad spending grew 18% YoY in Q4 2015, according to IgnitionOne. Mobile continues to drive the most sales growth for retailers, but sales still aren't keeping up with retail traffic. IBM found that smartphone traffic beat both tablet and desktop, making up 53% of all online traffic. But mobile still only accounted for 29% of all online sales. Retailers only have themselves to blame for underperformance on mobile, as many still aren't using best practices for mobile websites and apps. Only 60% of the top 100 global retailers currently have a dedicated mobile website, according to The Search Agency. The increase in online shopping has put stress on the shipping and logistics industry. The number of UPS ground packages delivered on time during the holidays fell from 97% in 2014 to 91% in 2015, according to ShipMatrix. Retailers are beginning to explore alternative shipping options. Earlier this year Gilt Groupe switched its primary ground shipper from UPS to Newgistics.

Tech Apple Science Cars Geneva Motor Show Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 Nintendo NES     NES Classic Edition Stock Updates Posted: Mar 17 2017, 1:56pm CDT | by Luigi Lugmayr, in News | Technology News   NES Classic Shopping Guide   Here are the latest NES Classic availability updates. Quick Tips: Buy the Nintendo NES Classic on Amazon Enter our Nintendo NES Classic Giveaway Don't Miss: Enter the I4U News NES Classic Giveaway! The NES Classic Edition reseller prices are dropping for some reason again. The supply is not increasing, but it could be that finally the demand caves in. Reseller prices on March 16 drop to $149, plus $3.99 shipping on amazon.com. There are several offers around the $150 mark.  Prices have been $20 higher at the beginning of the week. We have been able to secure a NES Classic and a Switch to give away to our readers in March. Enter now to win a new Nintendo Switch and a Nintendo NES Classic in our two exclusive I4U News Giveaways. The NES Classic supply has not improved after months on the market. Target and Walmart stores have been the source of NES hunters a couple weeks ago, but both stores have not gotten significant new inventory in a long time. The last time the NES was on sale on amazon.com for the regular retail price of $59.99 was on Feb. 23. The only option that has worked in past days is Amazon Prime Now. The local delivery service of Amazon has offered the NES in select cities. The supply is extremely constraint and very sporadic. It is suspicious that only Amazon has the NES in stock and only sells them through Amazon Prime Now. It looks like Amazon set aside some NES inventory to use it to promote its local delivery service. Amazon only allows one NES Classic order per person. There is strict limit on how many NES an account can order for a set period of time, at least 24 hours. Ordering a NES via Amazon Prime Now is though great, but its a hassle to spot one in stock and ready for order. It arrives in 2 hours for free in the cities where Amazon Prime Now is available. NES hunters have to refresh the search for the NES Classic for their ZIP code on a regular basis to spot the NES in stock. There is also no pattern where the NES Classic will be available next on Amazon Prime Now. Target and Walmart stores have not shown significant inventory in the past days. Consumers scored NES classic consoles through Amazon Prime Now and Amazon Spain. NES Classic Edition Stock Updates NES Classic at Amazon.com The NES Classic reseller prices keep on rising. The NES Classic offers on the reseller market on Amazon.com on Monday, March 12 starting at $174.99 plus $3.99. Many offers are in the $178 to $190 region now. Amazon Prime Now has shown the NES Classic available in select cities for very short period of times throughout Wednesday. On Thursday at 1:25am ET, we spotted the NES Classic in stock for Las Vegas on Amazon Prime Now. NES hunters also are keeping an eye on Amazon.es as NES supply in the United States has dried up. Cost of ordering a European version of the NES on Amazon Spain is reasonable. NES Classic at Target The NES Classic at Target stores availability is still very low with 1% according to BrickSeek on Friday, March 15. The chances to find a NES at a Target store are low. NES Classic at Walmart The NES Classic at Walmart stores stock indicator drops to 1% according to BrickSeek on Friday, March 16. The chances to find a NES at a Walmart store are low. NES Classic at GameStop The NES Classic was last in stock at GameStop online on Feb. 9. GameStop only offered the NES Classic as part of bundles starting at $79.99. Inventory lasted about 9 minutes. NES Classic at Best Buy The Nintendo NES Classic was on sale online at bestbuy.com on Friday, March 10. Overall the $59.99 NES inventory lasted about 12 minutes. This means that the consumer electronics giant only received a small shipment. NES Classic at ToysRUs Stores No new updates. NES not in stock at ToysRUs stores and online shop. TRU is only selling NES accessories online. See also our latest Nintendo Switch Stock Updates. BrickSeek has relaunched recently with a new modern interface. The inventory searches for Target and Walmart are still available. To check the NES stock situation at a nearby Walmart use this page on brickseek and for NES stock at Target stores use this page. Zoolert is now also offering a service to check inventory of retail locations. Zoolert supports besides Target and Walmart also ToysRUs, GameStop and Best Buy. Looking to buy a new Nintendo Switch console? Check out the latest in stock updates for the Nintendo Switch online. GameStop is offering a Switch bundle with April delivery online. The ability to mod the NES Classic and install an unlimited number of games has renewed the hype around the retro console. The latest version of hakchi2 allows NES owners to install over 800 NES games. A new hack even allows NES owners to run SNES games via an emulator.  It is easier to find NES Classic controllers Amazon now, although they are not from Nintendo. Here is a list of popular NES accessories on sale on Amazon. NES Classic Edition Accessories Nyko MiniBoss Controller for NES Classic Edition USB Cable for NES Classic (Eliminates the Need for AC Adapter) Classic USB NES Controller for PC / Mac Pernos 2Pack 10ft 3M Extension Cable for Nintendo NES Classic Mini Edition Controller Ortz 10ft Controller for NES Classic Mini [TURBO EDITION] Buttons 8Bitdo NES30 Classic Edition Wireless Controller Set with Bluetooth Retro Receiver 10ft Extend Link Extension Cable For Nintendo Mini NES Classic Edition RDS Industries NES Classic Edition Carrying Case Nintendo Classic Mini: Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) Controller Nintendo is under criticism for bad demand forecasting since years. Part of it is intentional as shortage generates buzz. The downside are the countless hours of people spent in line and the caused frustration. There is no update from Nintendo when the Japanese video game maker will resolve the shortage. The $59.99 Nintendo NES Classic Edition console launched on November 11 in stores and online. The supply was extremely constraint in stores and especially online. The palm-sized NES console, retailing for $59.99 list price, features the classic Nintendo NES controller many geeks have grown up with. The retro console comes pre-installed with 30 classic NES games including Super Mario Bros., Pac-Man, Metroid, Donkey Kong, The Legend of Zelda and Kirby's Adventures. The NES Classic Edition system is a miniaturized version of the groundbreaking NES, originally released in 1985. The Holiday shopping season 2016 has been dominated by the hunt for Hatchimals and the Nintendo NES classic edition. The NES Classic demand is still strong amidst ongoing shortage. In about one months the new Nintendo Switch will go sale and Nintendo fans brace for the worst. The Nintendo Switch pre-order are sold out. The supply situation might no be as bad as for the NES, but it will be difficult to get a Switch at launch for customers who have not pre-ordered the Switch. Find out how to get the Nintendo Shift on March 3.  Win a new Nintendo Switch and a Nintendo NES Classic in two exclusive I4U News Giveaways.

There is a sliding price of what the female farmer turned entrepreneur is willing to sell her product for — a 5 percent window from her starting price down to her rock-bottom discounted price, the walk-away number that is the same for every retailer in the world. Block has also figured out the value of everything that a retailer could offer that might factor into a discount: prominent product placement on the shelf or near a store's entrance, free catalog advertising, longer deal terms, special in-store or online promotions. "I always use margin requirements, but we'll take less margin for a strategic win that helps us meet a new goal or gain efficiencies in some other way, like less marketing costs," said Block. Her products, known as Fresh Cab (commercial) and Stay Away (her mass brand), offer a safer, more sustainable and more humane way to rid farms, homes and businesses of mice and bugs. "It's always an open discussion — creativity grows when you have restraint." Source: EarthKind Kari Warberg Block, founder of EarthKind Honed over the 15 years since founding her company, Block's negotiation techniques have helped win business with national stores like Lowe's, Ace Hardware and Target (online). She's grown EarthKind into a profitable $8.5 million, 30-employee entity since the discovery at her kitchen table in New Town, North Dakota, that balsam fir essential oil and ground-up corn cob repel mice effectively. But there's one Holy Grail of a customer that, despite saying it wants to sell EarthKind products, refuses to take part in Block's negotiations: Wal-Mart Stores. In 2013 Block flew to Bentonville, Arkansas, home of the retail giant, for an initial meeting with a Wal-Mart buyer (Block had hired a consultant to coach her on Wal-Mart's average price points and profit margins). Shortly after, the retailer emailed her a purchase order, but with a catch. Block said the price at which Wal-Mart wanted to buy EarthKind was 12 percent to 15 percent less than what they had discussed in person. (That's 12 percent to 15 percent less than Block's lowest price for any retailer.) Then Block couldn't get the buyer on the phone. "I received an email," she recalled. "'That's not in our policy to negotiate on price,' [the buyer] said. It was disappointing." A second email, saying the same thing, followed another unreturned phone call from Block. Wal-Mart did not respond to repeated requests for comment. Block decided on her bottom-line message to Wal-Mart: She wouldn't work with the company, "not until you let me make money." "I would really like to do business globally with Wal-Mart … but if they're going to reduce the price on the shelf and use it as a loss leader, that's bad for my brand," the EarthKind founder said. Walking away from Wal-Mart and its hundreds of millions of weekly customers would dumbfound many small-business suppliers, but it turned out to be one of the best things Block, at the time, could have done for EarthKind. The Wal-Mart squeeze Stories of Wal-Mart squeezing suppliers are not new — it has, after all, built itself into the world's largest retailer mainly by offering rock-bottom prices to lure customers, an approach that became even more important when earnings sagged in recent years. The pain that comes from working with it includes difficulty scaling and maintaining business at the level that Wal-Mart demands. Even though Wal-Mart's leverage in deals is no secret, saying no to Wal-Mart's business isn't something most small firms want to do. Landing the behemoth as a buyer of their goods is a dream for many suppliers, as it can swiftly lead to rocketing sales and market share. Wal-Mart's CEO, Doug McDillon, boasts on the company's web site, "For our suppliers, working with Wal-Mart means access to the 260 million customers who shop our stores around the world each week." More from iCONIC: Business lessons that fueled Reed Hastings' 20-year $60 billion Netflix run A booming start-up center north of the border is rivaling Silicon Valley Lending gap or not, women are beating out men 5 to 1 in this booming sector Reaching even a small percentage of Wal-Mart shoppers would have been a good step in growth for EarthKind, which has just only started to break into mainstream, big-box retail. Its first customers, whom Block persuaded to try free samples of the solution she came up with by trial and error, were farmers and equipment dealers near her family's farm in New Town, North Dakota. "Farmers hate getting ripped off. They're cheap in that respect," Block said. The idea for the product came to Block during the early 2000s, at a time when she was looking to subsidize her family's $30,000-a-year farm income. One day while driving her truck, a mouse ran up her leg. After warding it off with perfume, she did some research. She found that 98 percent of the then-$100 million mice-control market was made up of poison-based products. By calling around to farm-supply stories, she also estimated that U.S. farmers lose roughly $8 million a year in farm equipment damage caused by pests. "Saying no to Wal-Mart allowed us to make sure we have good execution with our other customers. And it doesn't break their hearts when you say no to their competitors." -Kari Warberg Block, EarthKind founder Block handed out the initial samples in the fall of 2002. "I was also looking at human behavior. [Farmers] aren't going to take the time to hang something up or do anything extra; they were tossing in a bag of poison, so they might as well try this pouch," Block said. By February of the next year, most of the trial clients were happy. "They didn't have to clean up dead bodies; they didn't have to worry about poisoning their dogs," Block said. Selling the farm to grow the business Sales grew incrementally as EarthKind picked up more equipment dealers including her local John Deere, but then Block hit a roadblock. Her brand had just received some local press, and an Environmental Protection Agency representative sought her out at a tradeshow to tell her that any product being sold to control pests needs a license, a process that could cost up to $2 million. "[The rep] recommended that I not go through with it, but I made up my mind — my product had to come out because we just keep killing things, it goes against nature." Block said. "If I grew to have 2 percent of the market, that's a good little business." It took Block about four years of back-and-forth with the EPA and about $200,000 — much of which came from grants, the selling of her beloved pack horse and camper, and income selling produce — to finally get her license. She officially launched EarthKind in 2007, and on the backs of John Deere (her first national account) and a small army of farmers, she was able to work her way into RV and marine dealers. It took three years to get a callback from Menards, the Eau Claire, Wisconsin-based home improvement chain with about 300 stores in the Midwest. Dealing with Menards foreshadowed the experience she'd go through with bigger chains. It wanted a lower price, and it wanted her to change her brown-box packaging to a plastic clamshell. "They said, 'If you manufacture it in China, you'll get the price down to where you're going to sell it,'" Block recalled. "That defeats the whole purpose of growing a business using U.S. agricultural products that are environmentally-friendly, too." Block eventually hooked Menards on another idea, a store locator service technology on EarthKind.com that lets customers see which stores are selling non-poison pest control. "I went back into their office and showed that we've got 30,000 customers in their area who would buy our product in your store if you had it," she said. Menards was impressed, and after a heated price negotiation — Block left the room when the buyer wanted a price lower than her walk-away limit — the retailer bit. Today, the retailer is one of EarthKind's most consistent buyers. The allure of all-natural IRI, a Chicago-based market research firm, estimates that year-over-year retail sales for the overall pest-control market — which includes chemical products and devices intended to kill insects and rodents — was almost $800 million as of late December 2016, up 5.5 percent from the previous year. Unlike most of the poison-based products, 90 percent of this sector, EarthKind's are safe to use around food, children and pets. Driven by consumer demand in other industries as well, the all-natural category is growing. Sixty-one percent of pest-control users polled prefer to use natural, non-chemical alternatives, according to a recent Mintel Group research report. This is what eventually led Lowe's, the world's second-largest home improvement chain, to strike up a deal with EarthKind two years ago, after meeting Block at a woman business owner-focused tradeshow. Lowe's had conducted some surveys and found that customers were asking for all-natural options for things like herbicides and pesticides. Lowes was impressed with EarthKind's history selling to the agricultural industry, and after some trial and error on new packaging and price negotiations, Lowe's placed EarthKind's Stay Away in a prime spot in 350 of its stores. "Her products do really well," said Jason Miller, Lowe's merchandising director for lawn and garden. "We were happy with the accretive sales it has produced; it didn't steal from the category." In December, Lowe's extended its deal with EarthKind to place its products in 1,700 of its stores, a program that will extend into April. The Lowe's business is indicative of how EarthKind has grown over the past year. Sales to hardware stores and farm/home stores grew 51.5 percent and 44 percent respectively, while new sales to grocery stores and lawn and garden stores grew 695 percent. Lowe's also illustrates the type of partnership that Block says is integral to growing her firm the way she wants. The back and forth she carries out with such retailers — price negotiations almost always follow each big new order — is typical of what analysts call a good relationship between vendor and buyer. "Key vendor relationships with retailers are very collaborative and not adversarial," said Charlie O'Shea, a senior analyst at Moody's who covers large retail. "It may get down to the nitty-gritty on price every so often, but it's hard for a large retailer to flip a switch and replace a key vendor." show chapters The two questions to ask yourself if you really want to be an entrepreneur    Monday, 3 Oct 2016 | 10:29 AM ET | 01:15 While accepting the deal (sans negotiation) with Wal-Mart would have definitely boosted EarthKind's revenue, it would have strained the firm on a few different levels. "We didn't have the infrastructure to support the customer — I didn't want my people focusing on one customer solely. … Such a big [account] ends up risking the report cards with others," Block said, who decided early on that no single retailer would make up more than 15 percent of EarthKind's business. (Lowe's made up 15 percent of the firm's sales last year.) Settling on a lower price with Wal-Mart could have also impacted deal-making with everyone else. "All of a sudden my negotiation in that room [with another retailer] becomes much more difficult if they throw the Walmart [price] up," she said. There was also the fear that Wal-Mart's lower price may have eroded EarthKind's profit margins and hindered Block's growth plan. That plan includes sourcing American-grown raw materials from family farms, manufacturing stateside, keeping a low carbon footprint, and investing in a workforce of which 20 percent is made up of developmentally-disadvantaged workers, who help with packaging. She also provides 100 percent paid health care, vacation packages and bonuses for all employees based on company growth and profitability. While a deal with Wal-Mart won't happen until Block can facilitate a more involved price debate, she's slowly ramping up operations so EarthKind can handle other big retail brands — maybe Target and Costco — in the next year or so. In 2015, she moved manufacturing from North Dakota to North Carolina so she could ship product quickly and more cost-effectively to retailers. Last year, she added robotics to the plant floor. She has also hired three executives to fill out her leadership team. One indirect way to finding more big customers — and another possible way into Wal-Mart and Target — is via Burt's Bees, the all-natural skincare line owned by The Clorox Company that Wal-Mart already sells. EarthKind is an inaugural member of Burt's Bees Launchpad, an annual grant program that helps start-ups operating in the all-natural health and well-being market. Through the contacts she's made in the program, Block recently toured the Burt's Bees factory, where she picked up ideas on how to reward and motivate employees. Block is also mentoring a Burt's Bees sales planner, who previously ran the firm's business with Target. "We've not been able to get into Target stores — they own the moms and millennials market," Block said. Meanwhile, Block has no regrets about playing hard-Moneyball with the world's biggest retailer: "Saying no to Wal-Mart allowed us to make sure we have good execution with our other customers," she said. "And it doesn't break their hearts when you say no to their competitors." — Maggie Overfelt, special to CNBC.com show chapters Wal-Mart wanted to stock her homemade product … but she had to say no    Monday, 13 Jun 2016 | 8:16 AM ET | 01:22 To view this site, you need to have JavaScript enabled in your browser, and either the Flash Plugin or an HTML5-Video enabled browser.

By John Kimelman Biography March 15, 2017 7:35 p.m. ET Getty Images Amazon has what might be called a high-class problem. The company is frighteningly good at its core business, which is selling goods of all kinds online – even groceries now -- to consumers who are happy to forfeit a trip to a store. As a result, the company generated $136 billion in revenue last year and now reportedly has a 43% share of all online retail sales in 2016, according to Slice Intelligence.

But Amazon’s hypersuccess has led to a common belief that the company’s better mousetrap – a great technological interface, reliable fulfillment, and customer service that puts most others to shame -- is almost single-handily destroying the brick-and-mortar retail industry. And that perception has drawn a certain amount of unwanted attention. During the president’s campaign, then-candidate Donald Trump argued that the company had an “antitrust problem,” though Trump’s criticism was also tied into his personal animus for CEO Jeff Bezos, whose Washington Post was quite tough on him during the election. More From Barron’s The Future of ETFs Ball Corp.: A Can-Do Can Maker What Fund Flows Really Say About the Market Since Trump was elected president, Amazon has taken steps to deal with its high-class problem. In January the company announced that it would hire more than 100,000 people in the U.S. in the next 18 months. And Trump has lightened up on his criticism of Amazon and other large tech companies – at least for now. But that hasn’t stopped press accounts that tend to view Amazon’s gains as coming at the expense of brick-and-mortar retailing ranging from electronics to food. For example, a recent piece on the Cheat Sheet Website profiles four traditional retailers – Macy’s, Best Buy, Office Depot, ODP -1.050420168067227% Office Depot Inc. U.S.: Nasdaq USD4.71 -0.05 -1.050420168067227% /Date(1490043600148-0500)/ Volume (Delayed 15m) : 4016327 AFTER HOURS USD4.71 % Volume (Delayed 15m) : 664821 P/E Ratio 6.826086956521739 Market Cap 2450548001.13395 Dividend Yield 2.1231422505307855% Rev. per Employee 290026 More quote details and news » ODP in Your Value Your Change Short position and grocery chains -- “that are getting destroyed by Amazon.” The piece, for example, writes that Amazon “is set to unseat Macy’s as the biggest seller of clothing in the U.S., which is bad news for the struggling department store. Sales are down at the mall chain and the retailer plans to shutter stores across the country.” Perhaps most remarkable in Amazon’s emerging role in groceries, a business that might have seem like a bridge too far for the online retailer just a few years ago. “Amazon may only control 1% of the grocery business in the U.S., but it’s poised to take a much bigger piece of the pie, threatening both small and large supermarket chains in the process,” writes Cheat Sheet. “Amazon is already the number one online grocery retailer in the country, Investor’s Business Daily reported, and it’s starting to expand its Amazon Fresh offering to more cities. The company’s offered grocery delivery for years, but it seems newly committed to making the service work, even though it presents logistical challenges. If enough people get on board with buying their canned goods, fresh produce, and meat online, it could spell big trouble for traditional supermarkets.” But some publications seem troubled by this characterization of Amazon as a company that is laying waste to entire industries. Tech publication Wired, for example, has run at least two articles recently that amount to full-throated defenses of the company. In January, Wired ran a piece that argued that Amazon has done nothing to deserve the label, monopoly. “So far, experts say Amazon’s dominance is just that: a company outdoing the competition in capitalism’s grand tradition,” the article adds. “But it may be on the verge of becoming the kind of monopoly that Trump’s top techie, Peter Thiel, says all companies should strive to be: ’the kind of company that is so good at what it does that no other firm can offer a close substitute.’ ” A more recent Wired article goes deeper in its defense of Amazon’s practices, arguing that it’s wrong to view the success of online retailers like Amazon and brick-and-mortar retailers as mutually exclusive. In fact, Amazon is partly a platform to help small retailers who now have access to more customers through Amazon’s online platform. Also, Amazon’s success, while killing certain traditional retail jobs, is also creating new types of employment tied to Amazon’s complex logistical system. “If e-commerce platforms continue to appeal to buyers and sellers, this may mean fewer traditional retail jobs —or it could simply mean a shift in the types of activities performed by people in retail occupations,” says the piece, written by Geoffrey A. Manne, executive director of the International Center for Law & Economics, and Jennifer MacLean, director of operations at ICLE. “It might also mean more jobs in manufacturing, transportation, advertising, coding, and logistics, to name a few. And while online distribution and automation may present certain challenges to traditional retailers, they also create significant opportunities. In fact, almost half of retail sales on Amazon’s platform are from third-party merchants who have chosen to sell their wares online instead of (or often, in addition to) through brick-and-mortar stores.” The piece adds that “while many are quick to disparage Amazon’s effect on local communities, these arguments fail to recognize that by reducing the costs associated with physical distance between sellers and consumers, e-commerce enables even the smallest merchant on Main Street, and the entrepreneur in her garage, to compete in the global marketplace.” Of course, it’s always troubling when the authors of a piece admit that their organization is receiving financial support from the company they are writing about, in this case Amazon. One wonders how differently the article might have been if Amazon wasn’t a benefactor. Still, if Amazon follows through on its commitment to hire 100,000 workers over the next 18 months, it will go a long to mitigating the criticism.

FILE PHOTO -- Shopping carts are seen outside a new Wal-Mart Express store in Chicago July 26, 2011.  About 6,700 pizzas sold under Wal-Mart's Marketside brand were affected by the recall, a representative of the supplier said on Thursday. RBR Meat Company recalled about 21,220 pounds of Marketside Extra Large Supreme Pizza that were shipped to retail distribution centers in California, Nevada, Utah and Washington, the USDA said on Wednesday. The product carries the code 20547. Wal-Mart and the USDA said they were unaware of illnesses linked to the pizzas. The retailer said it started removing the products from its shelves and inventory as soon as it received notice of the recall from Rose & Shore, a food company affiliated with Vernon, California-based RBR. The pizzas were available in California, Colorado, Nevada, Washington state, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Utah, Wyoming, Alaska and Hawaii, Wal-Mart said. Sam's Club was not affected. People should not eat the pizzas, according to the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service. It said RBR discovered the possible listeria contamination during routine sampling. Listeriosis is a serious illness caused by eating food contaminated with listeria bacterium, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The infection is most likely to sicken pregnant women and babies, adults older than 65, and people with weakened immune systems. An estimated 1,600 people contract listeriosis each year and about 260 die, according to the CDC. In an unrelated case, the CDC is investigating a multistate outbreak of listeriosis linked to the consumption of soft raw milk cheese made by Vulto Creamery that has led to two deaths.

Area residents say their community lacks grocery stores. Todd Sumlin tsumlin@charlotteobserver.com A pedestrian crosses West Blvd. near Remount Road. Area residents say their community lacks grocery stores. Todd Sumlin tsumlin@charlotteobserver.com 1 of 2 i By Katherine Peralta and Gavin Off kperalta@charlotteobserver.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Getting to the nearest grocery store takes Tribonia Ponder about an hour. Ponder, who lives off West Boulevard and does not have a car, typically takes the No. 10 bus uptown, then transfers to the No. 2, which drops her off at the Wal-Mart Supercenter on Wilkinson Boulevard. Ponder, who works as a locker room attendant at a fitness center uptown, has five grown kids, and nine grandkids who sometimes accompany her on grocery-shopping trips. Having a supermarket close by, she says, would make life much easier. “Shopping with my grandkids is an adventure,” Ponder says. “Plus, you never know if the bus is going to be late or early.” The West Boulevard corridor is home to approximately 14,000 predominantly low-income residents, most of them African-American. Those who want to shop nearby can choose from a handful of small convenience stores and gas stations, as well as two Family Dollar stores. What they won’t find nearby is a full-service supermarket with a full selection of fresh produce, meat and dairy. “Our residents have to travel beyond the community boundaries to access fresh healthy groceries and other amenities,” says Rickey Hall, a longtime resident of the West Boulevard area and president of the West Boulevard Neighborhood Coalition. Less than 3 miles away, it’s a different story, as Charlotte’s grocery wars heat up in the heart of fast-growing South End. Publix opened a 55,000-square-foot store – its 12th in the Charlotte region – in 2015 at South Boulevard and Iverson Way. Less than half a mile down South Boulevard, construction on a new Harris Teeter store is underway – and half a mile from there, German grocer Lidl is planning a new 33,000-square foot store. It’s a pattern repeated in other higher-income parts of Charlotte. In Cotswold, a new Publix is under construction across Randolph Road from a Harris Teeter. And in the Arboretum area, near another Harris Teeter, developers are seeking approval to rezone an office park to accommodate a 49,000-square-foot grocery store, rumored to be a Publix. The paradox of Charlotte’s grocery wars heating up in some areas, but not others, underscores the uneven economic growth in a city that has ranked among the worst in America for providing opportunities for poor residents to lift themselves out of poverty. “If we were to create a map of food deserts and places where you would consider cultural deserts, places that don’t interface with cultural institutions ... it wouldn’t surprise me if all of those would line up in the same way that middle school proficiency, officer-involved shootings and concentrated poverty do,” says Brenda Tindal, a Charlotte native and historian at the Levine Museum of the New South. The seven grocery stores that have opened in Mecklenburg County since 2015 are located in thriving, predominantly white neighborhoods where the median household income is nearly 50 percent higher than the county’s median of $56,800, according to an Observer analysis. Developers continue to target higher-income areas like uptown – where a Whole Foods is going up on Stonewall Street, and where Publix is planning a store on North Tryon – and remain less likely to build in lower-income areas. Retailers, too, tend to follow population growth – more rooftops mean more profits. That’s especially true in the grocery industry, which operates on thin profit margins. It’s no wonder grocers are flocking to South End: Up and down South Boulevard, new restaurants, breweries, clothing shops and offices are popping up at the same time renters flock to the area. Mecklenburg County has permitted more than 20 apartment developments in the South End area, worth some $360 million since 2012, records show. In its 2015 “State of the Plate” report, the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Food Policy Council identified three areas in the city as “high food insecurity risk areas” – the West Boulevard Corridor between Billy Graham Parkway and I-485, the Brookshire Boulevard corridor between I-85 and I-485, and the Albemarle Road corridor between I-485 and the Mecklenburg County boundary line. Simply put, experiencing “food insecurity” means a job loss or a car breakdown could disrupt your household’s access to food. In these areas, where the median income is lower than that of the county, most people could reach a full-service supermarket by car within five minutes. Trouble is, many don’t have a car. Over half of those in the report living in “high food insecurity risk areas” listed transportation as a challenge. And even for those who have cars, options are limited. There are simply fewer food stores of any kind in those areas. “It really comes down to median income of the census tract that you’re in. A lot of these lower-income areas aren’t going to see a major grocer come in,” says Katherine Metzo, a principal at Elemental Research and Consulting and an author of the report. “Most food insecurity is episodic, not chronic. Hunger is not a huge problem in Charlotte, but food insecurity is,” Metzo explains. “Maybe you lost your job and had to sell your car. Or suddenly you’re not working, so now you have to go far outside your neighborhood to buy milk.” On West Boulevard, Robin Lunn’s family has owned the BP gas station for years. She said having a full-service supermarket in the West Boulevard area would “mean a lot” for her customers. “We have a lot of groceries (at the gas station), but it’s not the same. We don’t have meat – it’s a lot of canned goods and stuff like that,” Lunn says. Location, location, location Phil Lempert, a supermarket industry analyst, says he sees opportunity for smaller format stores – such as Wal-Mart’s new convenience store concept, as well as low-cost European grocers Aldi and Lidl – in lower income areas like those identified in the State of the Plate report. “Those (grocers) are the ones that make money and serve at the same time,” Lempert says. A Wal-Mart spokeswoman said there are no plans yet to open convenience stores in Charlotte. Lidl and Aldi have not disclosed plans to open new stores in the three areas identified in the report, either. “For traditional supermarkets – Wegmans, Harris Teeter, Kroger, and the like – they have to look at what can the market do to really support a store that’s 50,000 or 60,000 square feet? Can they generate a couple million dollars in sales each week in that area?” For Matthews-based Harris Teeter, for example, factors involved in site selection include size and configuration of sites, existing and future traffic patterns, the proximity of existing Harris Teeter stores, as well as other demographic and economic considerations, including residential growth, according to spokeswoman Danna Robinson. Florida-based Publix, which entered the Charlotte market in 2014 and competes most closely with Harris Teeter, declined to discuss the site selection process. But, “all of our stores are exceeding our projected sales,” spokeswoman Kimberly Reynolds said. Still, some grocers like Food Lion do cater to lower-income shoppers – spokeswoman Christy Brown-Phillips said the company’s heritage is rooted in “low prices and convenient locations.” The Salisbury-based chain did not open any new stores in the Charlotte area over the last couple of years, but it did recently wrap up the $215 million renovation of its supermarkets in the Charlotte area. Bi-Lo also has converted three of its Charlotte stores into Harveys Supermarkets over the last year. Harveys focuses on low prices and has a special price point called the $1 Zone, in which 650 items are priced $1, including beverages, canned goods, cleaners, meals, greeting cards, baby and health items. None are in the “food insecurity” risk areas – although one, on Albemarle Road, sits close by. A total of 27 grocery stores – nearly all of them Food Lions – are under renovation or have recently been renovated around the Charlotte region. Unlike Mecklenburg’s new supermarkets, these stores are in areas where the median income is less than the county’s average, an Observer analysis found. Most of those stores are also in neighborhoods where minorities comprise more than half the population, records show. Community activism Efforts are underway in areas like the West Boulevard corridor to create neighborhood-run grocery co-ops, or nonprofit food-buying clubs. Hall, president of the area’s Neighborhood Coalition, has been involved with trying to get a supermarket to open in the area for almost three decades. His efforts began in the early 1990s, when the federal government seized the property of the Westover Shopping Center at the corner of West Boulevard and Remount Road. The shopping center sat vacant and neglected for a decade before it was turned into City West Commons. Hall says all kinds of stores were approached – including Food Lion, Bi-Lo and Winn-Dixie. Nothing materialized. So now, Hall is teaming up with other residents to launch a 15,000-square-foot community co-op grocery store and gardens at the corner of Clanton Road and West Boulevard. It’s a five-year effort that will cost an estimated $6.6 million. Among other things, the project will include a learning lab, gardens, production greenhouses and a co-op grocery store. Wells Fargo is helping to fund part of the initiative. Metzo lauds such grassroots efforts. “It’s not the same as having a grocery store and I wouldn’t pretend that it is, but it’s an important step in gaining a partnership at the level of people who are in a position to affect policy in a big way,” she says. facebook twitter email Share More Videos 0:44 The Oinker food truck helps to feed homeless Pause 2:46 Sharon UMC congregation says goodbye to 'ski slope' church building 0:24 Gamecocks coach Frank Martin conducts hugfest 0:58 Gov.

Photo by Robert Cohen, rcohen@post-dispatch.com A family tragedy unfolded Thursday in a series of dramas in Glen Carbon and Highland: a deadly house fire, an infant saved from a sinking SUV, a body recovered in a lake. A woman's body was pulled from the lake. The body was later identified as Cristy L. Campbell, 32, of Dogwood Lane in Glen Carbon. She was the mother of the infant. A body found in the Glen Carbon house was a man, a source said. The baby boy was taken to a St. Louis hospital for treatment after being pulled from the SUV in Silver Lake around 6 a.m. He was expected to make a full recovery and to be released Friday, Madison County Sheriff John Lakin said at a news conference Thursday afternoon. "Fortunately there is something good that can come of this," Lakin said of the child's survival. Authorities were notified about 5:15 a.m. that a house on Dogwood Lane in Glen Carbon was burning. Six children who were in the house when the fire began escaped. Some of those children ran to a nearby Wal-Mart to call 911, said Glen Carbon Police Lt. Wayne White. The caller said there was a possible victim inside, White said, but the house was fully involved and firefighters could not safely enter until they had put the fire out. The body was removed midafternoon Thursday. An autopsy will be done. A surveillance video obtained from a neighbor shows an SUV's headlights switching on in the driveway of the house about 4:50 a.m. Several minutes later, the SUV backs out of the driveway. About 3 minutes later, a reflection from the flames of the burning house can be seen on the side of a nearby house. Four children run across the street, heading in the direction of Wal-Mart. The smallest child is carrying a blanket. Around 5:30 a.m. about 16 miles east of the Glen Carbon house, a 911 caller notified the Madison County Sheriff's Office that a vehicle had driven into Silver Lake, off Route 143. Highland EMS made it to the lake first and paramedic Todd Zobrist rushed into the cold water and searched the vehicle.  Lakin lauded Zobrist as a "hero," saying he swam out 50 to 75 feet into the lake, did a sweep of the car and found the three-month-old baby floating inside the vehicle with about six or eight inches of air space. The baby was lifeless when Zobrist pulled him from the SUV and Zobrist began CPR on the roof of the vehicle, which was partly submerged, Lakin said. The infant was rushed to a St. Louis hospital. At the same time, authorities launched a boat to search for the driver. They issued a plea for the public's help in finding Cristy Lynn Campbell, a "person of interest." +12  Police have released his photo of Cristy L. Campbell, 32, who is a person of interest in the house fire that killed one person in Glen Carbon, Ill., Thursday morning.  Glen Carbon police Cristy Campbell's body was found around 11:15 a.m. about 400 feet from where the vehicle went into the water, Lakin said. It was pulled from the lake around 1:15 p.m. A gun was found inside the SUV, a source said. Cristy Campbell was divorced in Madison County in 2012 from Justin Campbell, according to court records. She identifies Justin Campbell on Facebook as being the father of her children. The divorce was granted by default when he failed to appear in court. Cristy Campbell was awarded custody of the children. Cristy Campbell has published photos of herself with seven children, including a baby boy, Julian, born in December. The four boys and two girls range in age from 4 to 14. A neighbor, Sherry Ricker, said she believed that Justin Campbell was living at the house, a split level on a street of well kept ranch and two-story houses. She said the family was always busy because the kids were involved in a variety of activities, and that the house was filled with trophies. She said she saw Cristy Campbell and held the baby three days ago. "She was happier than I had seen her in a long time," Ricker said. All seven children, "to include the infant child rescued from the submerged vehicle," are accounted for and safe, the Madison County Sheriff's Office said in a press release. They are with family members, Lakin said. Court records point to a tumultuous relationship between Cristy and Justin Campbell. In 2005, Justin Campbell was charged with domestic abuse. Prosecutors said he caused bodily harm to Cristy Campbell, then known as Cristy L. Brueggemann, by slapping her in the head when she was 16 weeks pregnant. He was sentenced in March 2006 to a year of probation and fined $500. The couple, who by this time had three children, was married on Nov. 3, 2006, at the Madison County Court House. Justin Campbell's probation was revoked when he failed to pay on time and appear in court, and he was arrested in October 2007. The case was closed again in December 2007. In 2010, Cristy Campbell sued her husband for divorce, but withdrew the suit. On April 24, 2012, she alleged abuse again. "He has choked me, he has pushed me several times, he has slapped me in my head, he has pushed me into bricks,” she wrote. A judge granted an emergency order of protection on April 25, 2012, and Cristy Campbell sued again for divorce. On May 10, 2012, the couple appeared in court together and Cristy Campbell asked for the protection order to be dismissed; it was. The divorce was finalized on July 27, 2012. She was awarded custody, he was granted visitation rights. In February 2014, Cristy Campbell requested supervised visitation, alleging that one of the children told her his father had pinched and punched him, and another child said he had been choked. The court ordered that Justin Campbell’s visitation take place at a court-approved neutral location. In May 2014, Glen Carbon Police cited Cristy Campbell after she allegedly allowed a 5-year-old child to leave their home on Dogwood Lane and “wander around the streets of Glen Carbon unattended.” She attended parenting classes in exchange for prosecutors dropping the charge. Authorities said at the news conference that they had answered about 50 calls at the house since 2010, including hangup 911 calls, barking dog calls and some domestic calls. The house stood Thursday with melted siding and a charred roof line. A Spiderman bicycle was propped against a wall, near an angel statue. A manager at Bob Evans restaurant in Collinsville, where Justin Campbell was employed and worked on Wednesday, said the staff is distraught. Campbell was "an outstanding guy," he said, who "loved his kids." Silver Lake is about 16 miles east of the Glen Carbon home that burned. Jeremy Kohler, Ashley Jost and Robert Cohen of the Post-Dispatch contributed to this article. Here's our earlier coverage: A deadly house fire early Thursday in Glen Carbon and an SUV carrying only an infant rolling into a lake in Highland are connected, authorities said. The body of a man was found in the Glen Carbon house, and a woman's body was pulled from the lake, a source said Thursday afternoon. The woman was identified as Cristy L. Campbell, 32, of Glen Carbon, according to the Madison County Sheriff's Office. The baby was taken to a St. Louis hospital for treatment after being pulled from the SUV in Silver Lake around 6 a.m. The baby was expected to make a full recovery and to be released Friday, Madison County Sheriff John Lakin said at a news conference Thursday afternoon. The body was pulled from the lake around 1:15 p.m. It was found in a brushy area near the edge of the lake. A gun was found inside the SUV, a source said. An ID found inside a purse in the SUV belonged to a female who lived at the address where the fire occurred in Glen Carbon, the press release said. The man's body found at the house has not yet been identified. Law officers had launched a boat to search the lake and the coroner was called shortly after 11 a.m. Police in Glen Carbon, where one person died in the house fire early Thursday, had asked for help in finding the owner of the home. Cristy Campbell was a "person of interest," police said. By the time of the press conference Thursday afternoon, authorities said they were no longer looking for Cristy Campbell. Six children who were in the home when the fire began all escaped, authorities said. Cristy Campbell has published photos of herself with seven children, including a baby boy, Julian, born in December. The four boys and two girls range in age from 4 to 14. "We believe the infant in the lake at Highland could be the seventh in the family," said Glen Carbon Fire Chief Ralph Well. A paramedic went into the water to search the vehicle and found a baby floating in water with about 6-8 inches of air space inside the SUV. The baby was unresponsive when the paramedic pulled him out and the paramedic began CPR on the hood of the SUV, Lakin said. The baby was taken to a St. Louis hospital, said Fire Department Capt. Brad Menz. Menz said the SUV appeared to have rolled down a hillside into the lake around 6 a.m. near Illinois Route 143. No one else was in the vehicle, and it was not immediately clear how the car wound up in the water. At least 20 police officers were seen at the house next to where the car went into the lake. It was unclear if there was a connection between the home and the SUV. Detectives at the scene did not answer questions. Campbell was divorced in Madison County in 2012 from Justin Campbell, whom she identifies on Facebook as being the father of her children, according to court records. The divorce was granted by default when Justin Campbell failed to appear in court. Cristy Campbell was awarded custody of the children. Months prior to the divorce, Cristy Campbell sought and obtained an order of protection from the father, alleging abuse. The order was dismissed about two weeks later at the request of Cristy Campbell.  In a news conference earlier Thursday, Glen Carbon Police Lt. Wayne White said two of the children ran to a nearby Wal-Mart and called 911 after the fire broke out about 5:15 a.m. The caller said there was a possible victim inside, Well said, but the house was fully involved and firefighters could not safely enter it until they had put the fire out. Police informed firefighters that it was a crime scene and possibly related to the Highland incident, Well said. The body inside the house was removed about 3:40 p.m. A surveillance video obtained from a neighbor shows the headlights turning on in an SUV parked in Campbell's driveway about 4:50 a.m. Thursday. Several minutes later, the SUV backs out of the driveway and two small children can be seen in the headlights. About 3 minutes later, a reflection from the flames of the burning house can be seen on the side of a nearby house. Four children run across the street, heading in the direction of Wal-Mart. The smallest child is carrying a blanket. About 5:01 a.m., a black sedan pulls into the frame and parks across the street from the house. Two men walk in the direction of the Wal-Mart. A few minutes later, the men return to the car, turn around in the cul de sac and sit there as a fire truck comes down the street. The car leaves when the fire truck passes it. Sherry Ricker lives across the street from the Campbell residence. She said the family was always busy because the kids were involved in a variety of activities, and that the house was filled with trophies. She said she saw Cristy Campbell and held the baby three days ago. "She was happier than I had seen her in a long time," Ricker said.

Quotes in the article Wal-Mart Stores Inc WMT ▲ 69.98 +0.09 +0.13% About 6,700 pizzas sold under Wal-Mart's Marketside brand were affected by the recall, a representative of the supplier said on Thursday. RBR Meat Company recalled about 21,220 pounds of Marketside Extra Large Supreme Pizza that were shipped to retail distribution centers in California, Nevada, Utah and Washington, the USDA said on Wednesday. The product carries the code 20547. Wal-Mart and the USDA said they were unaware of illnesses linked to the pizzas. The retailer said it started removing the products from its shelves and inventory as soon as it received notice of the recall from Rose & Shore, a food company affiliated with Vernon, California-based RBR. The pizzas were available in California, Colorado, Nevada, Washington state, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Utah, Wyoming, Alaska and Hawaii, Wal-Mart said. Sam's Club was not affected. People should not eat the pizzas, according to the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service. It said RBR discovered the possible listeria contamination during routine sampling. Listeriosis is a serious illness caused by eating food contaminated with listeria bacterium, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The infection is most likely to sicken pregnant women and babies, adults older than 65, and people with weakened immune systems. An estimated 1,600 people contract listeriosis each year and about 260 die, according to the CDC. In an unrelated case, the CDC is investigating a multistate outbreak of listeriosis linked to the consumption of soft raw milk cheese made by Vulto Creamery that has led to two deaths.

Marineci is heading to a remote area of Idaho this summer hoping to help a community in need. Small-town America relies on a program that attracts foreign physicians to underserved areas. A recent federal change, however, could delay newcomers. NYT Dr. Fadel Nammour, a gastroenterologist who recently became an American citizen and came to North Dakota from Lebanon 14 years ago, in an operating room at the Sanford Medical Center Fargo in Fargo, N.D., March 17, 2017. Small-town America relies on a program that attracts foreign physicians to underserved areas. A recent federal change, however, could delay newcomers. (Tim Gruber/The New York Times) By Miriam Jordan / The New York Times In Coudersport, Pa., a town an hour’s drive from the nearest Wal-Mart, Cole Memorial Hospital counts on two Jordanian physicians to keep its obstetrics unit open and is actively recruiting foreign specialists. In Fargo, N.D., a gastroenterologist from Lebanon — who is among thousands of foreign physicians in the state — has risen to become vice president of the North Dakota Medical Association. In Great Falls, Mont., 60 percent of the doctors who specialize in hospital care at Benefis Health System, which serves about 230,000 people in 15 counties, are foreign doctors on work visas. Small-town America relies on a steady flow of doctors from around the world to deliver babies, treat heart ailments and address its residents’ medical needs. But a recent, little-publicized decision by the government to alter the timetable for some visa applications is likely to delay the arrival of new foreign doctors, and is causing concern in the places that depend on them. While the Trump administration is fighting, in the courts of justice and public opinion, for its temporary travel ban affecting six countries, the slowdown in the rural doctor pipeline shows how even a small, relatively uncontroversial change can ripple through the country. In Montana, where nine counties do not have a single physician, it means Benefis Health does not know when a Romanian doctor trained in kidney transplants will arrive. The health care company spent months recruiting the doctor and had been expecting her in July. The doctor, Silviana Marineci, who is completing a fellowship at the University of Minnesota, said she was frazzled by being in limbo. “I won’t have an income, I don’t know if I will afford rent, I don’t know where I will be,” she said. “It’s insane.” The procedural change regards temporary visas for skilled workers, known as H-1B visas. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services recently announced it would temporarily suspend a “premium processing” option by which employers could pay an extra $1,225 to have H-1B applications approved in as little as two weeks, rather than several months. Companies using that option, the government said, have effectively delayed visas for others that did not pay the extra fee. A spokeswoman for the immigration agency, Arwen Consaul, said in a statement that the measure was necessary to “work down the existing backlogs due to the high volume of incoming petitions.” The H-1B program has raised questions about whether it displaces American workers, particularly in computer programming and engineering jobs, for which most of the visas are issued. H-1B recipients also include foreign physicians who practice in places shunned by American doctors for personal and professional reasons. About 25 percent of all physicians practicing or training in the United States are foreign, but in some inner cities and most rural areas, that share is significantly higher. There were 211,460 international medical graduates practicing in the United States in December 2015, according to the latest data available from the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates. Sens. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn.; Susan M. Collins, R-Maine; and Heidi Heitkamp, D-N.D., have urged the agency to continue premium processing. “Slowing down this successful two-decade-old program and the doctors it brings to rural areas will hurt families across North Dakota and rural America,” Ms. Heitkamp wrote in an email. It was a North Dakota senator, Kent Conrad, who in 1994 proposed to relieve a shortage of doctors by tapping foreign physicians who have completed medical education in the United States. His program waives the requirement that foreign doctors who graduate from residency programs in the United States return to their home countries for two years before working here. It lures such graduates to practice in underserved areas by offering them the chance to apply for a green card to live permanently in the United States after three years. The program must be reauthorized by Congress every two years. Ms. Klobuchar, who twice has introduced legislation to make the program permanent, plans to do so again in the coming weeks. Since the program’s inception, tens of thousands of foreign physicians have flocked to clinics and hospitals in Appalachia, the Mississippi Delta region, the Great Plains and elsewhere. Many of them, such as Dr. Fadel E. Nammour, vice president of the North Dakota Medical Association, put down roots and never leave. The friendliness that he found in Fargo reminded him of his home country, Dr. Nammour said. “We provide not only the care but also our leadership,” said Dr. Nammour, who is now a U.S. citizen. “The focus should be on making it easier to bring people in to cover the physician shortage we have.” Sign up for free newsletters and get more of the Post-Gazette delivered to your inbox Most Read Most Emailed Advertisement Most Commented Your e-mail: Your Name: Friends e-mail: Friends Name: Message: Captcha Submit Advertisement Create a free PG account.

(AP) — A Wal-Mart in the Phoenix area was evacuated over what turned out to be a fake bomb. Peoria police say a store employee reported the suspicious-looking device found in a stockroom about 10:20 a.m. Saturday. A bomb squad and robot were called in to check the item, which was made to look like an explosive with wires and flashing lights. It was removed and the store was combed to ensure safety. The scene was cleared in about four hours, and the store reopened. Police say the hoax device didn't pose a danger but it caused fear and concern and authorities will be checking surveillance video as part of their investigation. No suspect has been identified. Wal-Mart issued a statement saying it takes "the safety and security of our customers and associates seriously at all times" and is helping the police with the investigation.

Ross was referencing Snoop Dogg’s music video for “Lavender,” which features a scene in which a gun that shoots a flag reading “BANG” is pulled on a clown Trump lookalike. “Can you imagine what the outcry would be if @SnoopDogg, failing career and all, had aimed and fired the gun at President Obama? Jail time!” Trump tweeted Wednesday, three days after the video’s release. Ross, who has been an ardent critic of the President, is no stranger to Trump-related music controversies himself. In his 2015 song, “Free Enterprise,” he raps about assassinating Trump: “Assassinate Trump like I’m Zimmerman / Now accept these words as they came from Eminem.” Billboard reported in December 2015 that Walmart allegedly pulled Ross’ album off the shelves because of the lyric. Walmart did not return Billboard’s requests for comment. Ross has never shied away from expressing his political views, and his newest album touches on the issues he cares about. “The title, ‘Rather You Than Me,’ that’s just the perspective of a young black dude coming up in an urban community,” the Florida rapper said. “As soon as the music come on, just let the music talk to you. You know I’ve always been open and I speak my mind on whatever the topic may be.” The album, released Friday, includes songs like “Dead Presidents,” featuring Jeezy, Yo Gotti and Future, “Powers that Be,” featuring New York rapper Nas and “Maybach Music V,” featuring DeJ Loaf, which Ross described as “a really airy type of feeling record.” The hip-hop star got political at the Woodie Awards, which recognizes the music voted best by college students, telling the audience during the live broadcast on MTV that in this divided time, it’s good to get together and be united by music. “The Woodies always been cool to me because it was a spot you can see artists while they’re still underground, before they’ve achieved mainstream success,” he told CNN. “When I came and performed at the Woodies, that was real big for me.” El Paso R&B artist Khalid, who performed his hit “Location” at the show, won “Woodie to Watch,” and The Chainsmokers, who presented Khalid with the award, won “Woodie of the Year.” Ross told audiences during the live MTV broadcast that he would make a great president because he would “pass the kind of laws we can support,” and asked them to “Vote Rozay” — a reference to the rapper’s nickname, “Ricky Rozay.” Rick Ross says he would make a great president one day because he would pass laws people can support: 1️⃣ Mike Ice Cube's birthday a federal holiday 2️⃣ Free haircuts at the barbershop on Friday's 3️⃣ Buy @richforever's new album 4️⃣ Legalize marijuana everywhere #mtvwoodies #RickRoss #sxsw2017 #sxsw A post shared by دينا زرو (@deenazeina) on Mar 16, 2017 at 9:51pm PDT He jokingly outlined his platform, but also touched on issues that he cares about, such as marijuana legalization: “No. 1, we make Ice Cube’s birthday a federal holiday. Free haircuts at the barbershop on Fridays,” Ross joked. “No. 2, you all have to go out and buy my new album available at 12 a.m., baby! Of course, I’ll legalize marijuana everywhere. God bless, everybody! Vote Rozay!” His remarks drew loud cheers from the audience. Ross said this was his first time “hosting anything,” adding that above all, he knew he would have a good time doing it. “Me being a boss, I’m only going to have a good time,” he said. “That’s the only thing that matters.” 30.267153 -97.743061 Filed in: NewsFix Suggest a correction × Suggest A Correction Your name Your email Report a typo or grammatical error Cancel Facebook Twitter Pinterest Reddit LinkedIn Email Got a Tip?

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    Wal-Mart Stores Inc. acquired online apparel seller ModCloth Inc. in an all-cash deal, part of an effort to expand its online operations and appeal to customers that may have avoided the retailer in the past. ModCloth will continue to operate as a stand-alone site, as well as work with Wal-Mart’s other operations, the retail giant said on Friday. ModCloth Chief Executive Officer Matt Kaness and his 300-plus employees will join Wal-Mart’s e-commerce team. Terms of the transaction, which was completed on Friday, weren’t disclosed. The move follows Wal-Mart’s acquisition of Jet.com for $3.3 billion last year in a deal that revamped its web division and brought in a fresh team of e-commerce executives. Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon has vowed to turn the brick-and-mortar colossus into “more of a digital enterprise” that can better challenge Amazon.com Inc. The Bentonville, Arkansas-based company also bought outdoor e-tailer Moosejaw last month, adding trendy brands like Patagonia and the North Face to its assortment. Founded in 2002 by Susan and Eric Koger, ModCloth began as a vintage clothing seller, hawking items hand-picked by Susan. The business grew into a $150 million retailer known for its whimsical dresses and quirky outfits for the retro girl, but it faltered in 2014 as struggling sales growth led to two rounds of layoffs. The business had run into a problem many niche fashion companies experience: being unable to attain mass appeal even though it had won over a patch of devout shoppers. The founders stepped aside and hired Kaness, a retail veteran and former Urban Outfitters Inc. executive, to help bring ModCloth into the mainstream. The brand dialed back on its more outlandish offerings, hoping to appeal to a broader range of women, and it created its first private-label apparel line. Then the company embarked on a physical retail expansion, opening pop-up shops as it honed an approach for an upcoming fleet of boutiques. In late 2016, it opened its first-ever permanent store in Austin, Texas. “Designers that sell on ModCloth who are interested in expanding their consumer reach will now have the opportunity to serve more customers through Jet.com and our other e-commerce sites,” Wal-Mart said in a statement Friday. © Copyright 2017 Bloomberg News.

MAIN REVIEWS MOVIES TV MUSIC CELEBS ABOUT US Privacy Policy SUBMIT A GUEST POST Connect with us Shockya.com Shockya.com MAIN REVIEWS MOVIES TV MUSIC CELEBS ABOUT US Privacy Policy SUBMIT A GUEST POST Kenny Johnson Uncovers a Terrorist Plot at a Check Point as Thriller Released on Home Entertainment Share Tweet Kenny Johnson Uncovers a Terrorist Plot at a Check Point as Thriller Released on Home Entertainment By Karen Benardello Published on March 18, 2017 Share Tweet Comment Actor Kenny Johnson is embarking on a determined mission to protect America in his latest thriller, ‘Check Point.’ The timely war film shows how an insurgent attack is threatening to escalate into a full-blown invasion of the US. As a result, Johnson’s character, Roy, is leading a team of unlikely heroes in his fight against the enemy. Roy and his supporters’ attack on the terrorists can now be witnessed by audiences across the country, as the drama is now available on home entertainment. ‘Check Point’ has been distributed on all formats, including such online platforms as iTunes US, Google Play, Xbox, Amazon Instant, Amazon DVD, Vudu (Walmart online) and Playstation. The cable providers that are broadcasting the action thriller are Comcast, Cos, Time Warner Cable, Brighthouse, Verizon Fios, Frontier, Suddenlink, Charter, Mediacom, CenturyLink, Google Play, Dish, DirecTV and Blockbuster/Sling TV. The DVD retailers releasing the movie are Walmart, Best Buy, Amazon.com, Netflix, Redbox, and Military Base shops. Award-winning filmmaker Thomas J. Churchill wrote, directed and produced the movie. While discussing ‘Check Point,’ the helmer revealed, “I have written many scripts and produced (and) directed a few films. But nothing compared to where my mind went with ‘Check Point.'” Churchill added that “The idea of ‘Check Point’ was something that has been with me since 1987. At one time, I wanted to be in the service as my father, uncles, grandfather and even my brother served our country. But I realized that it takes a very special kind of person to wear the uniform and defend their country. At that time in my life, my mind drifted more to the cinema and I wanted to make movies…where people can escape their worries and problems and lose themselves for a bit and get caught up in the world of cinema.” In addition to Johnson, ‘Check Point’ stars an ensemble cast, including WWE Universal Champion Bill Goldberg, William Forsythe, Martial Arts Hall of Famer Mel Novak, Kane Hodder, Tyler Mane, Fred “The Hammer” Williamson, Former UFC Champion John Lewis and Krista Grotte. The thriller also features the last last on screen performance by the late Ricky Harris. ‘Check Point’ follows the result of what happens when a sleeper cell terrorist plot is discovered in a small town where everyone knows one another, or so they thought. Justice seems lost, especially when an insurgent attack threatens to escalate into a full-blown invasion of the US. But a team of unlikely heroes, who are led by Roy, rises up to protect their beloved country.

The G20 meeting: Score One for the Economic Nationalists Dan Griswold: The foreign stake in our economy continues to grow, but the net worth of Americans has grown even more Evidence and the Trump budget More options: Share, Mark as favorite Some economic lessons from the demise of Gander Mountain: creative destruction, consumer sovereignty, Amazon effect View related content: Carpe Diem The chart above shows the phenomenal 127.5% rise in Amazon’s stock over the last two years, compared to a 18.5% increase in the NASDAQ Index (green line), an 11.3% increase in Apple shares (red line), and a nearly 15% decrease in Wal-Mart stock (purple line) over that same period. That rise in Amazon’s stock price is from the “Amazon Effect” and the “Amazon Doctrine,” which are described below as they relate to an article in today’s Detroit Free Press titled “Gander Mountain latest sports retailer to fail.” Here’s an excerpt of that article (emphasis added): Outdoor goods company Gander Mountain is the latest retailer to falter under competition from online sellers, announcing that it has filed for bankruptcy protection and will close dozens of stores. The St. Paul, Minn-based chain says that it will begin shuttering 32 stores over the next several weeks. It filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Friday in the face of dwindling store traffic and shelves stocked with more goods than it was able to sell. Throughout the retail sector, traditional stores, from big box chains to specialty shops, have struggled to entice shoppers through their doors as consumers increasingly do their buying online. Last month, roughly 14% of retailers monitored by Moody’s Investors Service could be deemed “distressed.’’ And several chains have sought bankruptcy protection, including American Apparel, Wet Seal, and The Limited. But the sporting goods sector appears to be in particular peril, with e-commerce competitors often offering consumers more options for lower prices. There have been at least ten other bankruptcies among sports chains with over $10 million in liabilities in the last year and a half. Prior to Gander’s announcement, MC Sports was the most recent sports retailer to seek bankruptcy protection, saying last month that it would close 68 locations. That move that will wipe out 1,300 jobs throughout the Midwest. Others shutting their doors include Sports Authority, once the second biggest sports retail company in the U.S., which shuttered more than 400 locations when it liquidated last year. Golf equipment giant Golfsmith filed for bankruptcy protection in September, and Sport Chalet, a southern California-based chain closed in 2016 after being in business for 57 years. Here are some economic lessons from the demise of Gander Mountain: 1. The forces of creative destruction, including the destruction of jobs, are unstoppable and beneficial to the economy. Economic progress and job destruction go hand in hand, as economist Richard McKenzie explained in the Wall Street Journal 25 years ago. This recent wave of job destruction in the retail sector is a good thing, and should not be impeded or stopped.  That is something that Team Trump should keep in mind as they pursue their  misguided public-policy philosophy of jobism, which mistakenly makes the count of jobs the key measure of a country’s economic success or failure. While Team Trump is quick to blame outsourcing and international trade for US job losses, it’s important to recognize that the domestic forces of innovation, disruption, technological advances, creative destruction, competition and changing consumer tastes are even more to blame for the loss of jobs in this country. But while bankruptcies and job losses are usually reported as bad news, there is an upside to these business closings – they release resources and labor to be re-deployed to other sectors of the economy that are growing and are doing a better job of operating efficiently and pleasing consumers. To quote Richard McKenzie, “Revitalized competitiveness mandates a willingness to replace much that is old with much that is new. It requires widespread (not wanton) job destruction.” 2. Consumer sovereignty – consumers are the ultimate rulers (kings and queens) in the market economy and they — not producers — “run the show.” Producers, sellers and retailers are constantly at the mercy of consumers’ changing tastes, behavior, and buying habits. As US consumers increasingly prefer doing their shopping online for more convenience, greater selection, and lower prices, traditional brick-and-mortar stores will continue to struggle and many more will disappear. This trend should be welcomed as a sign of economic progress and job creation. To help the economy grow to its full potential, we have to be willing to tolerate (and welcome) job losses and business closings. 3. Consumer greed. While the term “greed” is frequently used for CEOs, corporations and businesses, it’s almost never used to describe the behavior of consumers. Just do a Google search of “corporate greed” and “consumer greed” and you see that there’s a ratio of about 67-to-1 in favor of “corporate greed.” But I think the term “greed” describes pretty accurately the behavior of most of us consumers, who have a laser-like focus on low prices, high quality, large selection and speedy delivery. Therefore, Gander Mountain’s demise should be blamed on “consumer greed.” If “greed” is too strong of a description, substitute the term”enlightened self-interest” to describe consumer behavior. But either way, if US consumers weren’t so damned concerned about low prices and their own convenience, Grander Mountain wouldn’t have declared bankruptcy. 4. The Amazon Effect is term used to describe the incredibly disruptive effects Amazon is having on the retail industry as it revolutionizes retailing, supply chain management and delivery, with a laser-like focus on creating value for consumers. Related to the Amazon Effect is Amazon’s official corporate version of consumer sovereignty known as The Amazon Doctrine (featured on CD here), summarized here: Above all else, align with customers. Win when they win. Win only when they win. There may be no other large company operating today that better illustrates the economic concepts of creative destruction and consumer sovereignty than Amazon – to the significant benefit of consumers, who are the direct beneficiaries of Amazon’s success as an internet-based online retailer. The remarkable rise in Amazon’s share price (illustrated above) is a market measure of its success at fulfilling The Amazon Doctrine of aligning with customers – its stock is winning in the market only because its customers are winning daily with low prices, a wide selection of great products and the convenience of shopping online from home – or from anywhere with a Smartphone. More than any other factors, it’s likely the combination of the Amazon Effect and Amazon Doctrine that are most responsible for Gander Mountain’s demise. Bottom Line: Here’s my economic forecast for the retail industry: Expect continued and very strong hurricane-strength Schumpeterian gales of innovation from the Amazon Effect, with a high likelihood of market disruption and creative destruction including more brick-and-mortar stores and jobs disappearing, accompanied by huge tsunami-level tidal waves of increased consumer surplus in the future. Hurricane Joseph (Schumpeter) and creative destruction are the consumer’s best friend, and ultimately the best friend of economic progress and job creation in the long run. Amazon Creative destruction Discussion: (74 comments) Tom March 14th, 2017 We agree! Though, the one I’m afraid of that is coming like a freight train aimed right at jobs is self driving vehicles. On one side I can’t wait because the benefits are huge… on the other side the large scale elimination of jobs all at once is going to be traumatic to say the least. Reply Share Michael March 15th, 2017 Tom I feel this is such flawed logic on your behalf. If we went back just 100 years and adopted this same mindset, what would be the affect moving from a more agriculture based society to information age vua automation of tractors, automation of industrialism, the advent of recent communication (radio, phone, tv, satellite, internet), air travel, supply chains, robotics, and the uncountable in numerous other inventions aided to benefit humanity. Should there be LESS jobs today give all this? In actuality aren’t there MORE jobs? I see no traumatic issue here. Reply Share Tom March 15th, 2017 I don’t think we’re in disagreement… but there will be trauma. It will be short term and then we’ll move on. But it could end up with violent protests etc until the economy can create new jobs to absorb the millions that will be laid off. Reply Share Barry March 15th, 2017 Fair point. The “transition” period will be tough for some people. Reply Share howard2374 March 16th, 2017 The ‘transition’ is always a tough period for some people. Change is constant, be prepared for change. Share morganovich March 16th, 2017 tom- 1. i think self driving cars are further off than many are currently claiming. 2. i think a shift to self drive is going to be gradual and a patchwork. the transition period will be long and further lengthened by laws and regulation. 3. the number of jobs this affects is likely about 1.5% of the US workforce. for such a shift to take place over, say, 5 years, is not going to be terribly tumultuous. we’ve had a great many transitions in employment far sharper than that. 4. but yes, if you are a long haul class 8 trucker, this is going to put pressure on you, though i doubt that pressure gets terribly intense for at least another decade, especially on interstate routes. 5. the natural attrition in that field alone swamps the impending automation. jobs may go away, but few people who were not leaving anyway will lose jobs. turnover in trucking jobs is 90%. there is currently an serious and persistent shortage of drivers. that alone will suck up the early parts of automation. i’m just having a hard time seeing how this winds up being a serious and damaging disruption. there’s lots of breathless media on it, but the facts seems to argue the opposite. Reply Share Warren Platts March 19th, 2017 Re: self-driving cars, consider this: at any given time, 15% of all drivers licenses are suspended, and 1 in 10 of drivers on the road at any moment doesn’t have a valid driver’s license, and there are many more “discouraged drivers”, if you will, that have ceased to drive and ceased to seek a new driver’s license. Discouraged workers probably many of them don’t have a license, and have given up on trying to get one, or the process just takes years, then when most job ads list a requirement for a valid driver’s license, they quit looking for work. Not to mention the number of jobs within walking distance can be limited in number and quality. So I predict if true self-driving cars where no one needed a license–if they’d let you do that–that would get a lot of discouraged workers back in the game, and be a big net stimulus to the economy. IMHO YMMV Share Jay March 16th, 2017 Don’t believe the breathless hype. It will be a long time before self driving cars dominate. The”devil is in the details” and those details are the hardest part. What will happen quickly are computer assisted safety systems. Reply Share lyle March 16th, 2017 Gartner has a curve on how technology is adopted and autonomous vehicles are listed at the peak of the hype cycle, soon to be falling into the valley of disillusionment. Their guess is 10+ years. Note that computer assisted safety systems are available today on higher end cars, systems such as forward crash mitigation, side blind spot alert, autonomous cruise control, rear object detection, can be had on many mid to high end vehicles but you will have to special order because dealers don’t feel in general that the features sell well. (Depends on city, they sell well in Austin, but not San Antonion for example a 1k add on Honda Sensing package is not common on San Antonio dealers lots but is common on Austin dealers lots.) Reply Share Ron H. March 16th, 2017 lyle What is a Honda Sensing package, and why would I want to detect Hondas? As common as they are, I would think my detection system would be alerting almost continuously, thus rendering the system virtually useless. More useful, perhaps, would be a Non-Honda detection system that only alerts when there are NO Hondas in my immediate vicinity. That probably happens only infrequently, and is something a driver might be interested in knowing. Share Tim March 16th, 2017 https://youtu.be/M_IrQO42RI8 Reply Share Marque2 March 14th, 2017 Ma y retail stores could do a better job of helping customers. I went to Best Buy, for instance, to look for a particular type of keyboard because I needed it right away. Staff person said, I think we have one in the back, and pointed in the general direction, leaving me to hunt it down. After saying it wasn’t right, I would have been happy if the staff person went on the BB web page and helped me order one, delivered to the store. No such luck. I pointed out I came to BB first before I went to Amazon, and then left the store. Though I do try to not purchase from Amazon any more because Bezos annoys me with his ham handed, supercilious political activism. I don’t know why he publically insults at least half his customers. If he gave to lefty causes in private like the Costco’s and the Progressives (insurance) I would be more comfortable. Reply Share Sprewell March 15th, 2017 Stores like Best Buy cannot afford to hire as many or as knowledgable sales staff to stand around waiting to help their lower customer traffic, which means people go there less, so they hire less and so on: a vicious cycle till they go out of business. Meanwhile, I can read a bunch of Amazon or Newegg reviews much more cheaply than hiring that sales staff and get exactly the keyboard I want. That is how the internet is killing off retail. I don’t know what “political activism” you think Bezos is involved with. People who try to figure out his politics aren’t really sure, but it’s probably libertarian. Of course, he’s no Trump fan, which is what probably annoys you, but likely agrees with him on deregulation and low taxes, while disliking his immigration and protectionist trade policies, both of which are standard views of most libertarians, such as most of the commenters here. That’s a fairly mixed view towards Trump: funny how you Trump fans always want to cast everybody as dead-set against Teflon Don, regardless of how nuanced their position is. PS, I considered Don almost as bad as Hillary, but the lesser of the two evils. I would never vote for either, and didn’t vote this time, but gun held to my head and only given those two to choose, it’d be Don every time, as I can’t stand Queen Hilldog and her entitled ways. The media completely covered up for how she was almost as dumb as Trump and worse on most policy issues. Reply Share howard2374 March 16th, 2017 I concur. However, stores like Best Buy should be places where people can go to see and touch the items, get person to person dialog about the object of interest, and be able to order on line and have the option of going to the store to pick up the item or have the item home delivered. Trying to get explinations over the phone, going through the ‘calling tree’ is not user friendly or information satisfying. Brick & Mortar must recognize their strengths, tout their advantages, and capitalize on it. Reply Share Sprewell March 16th, 2017 Yes, Ron and I discussed more than a year ago how some of the retail space might be kept around as showrooms, only for certain goods that need to be handled first, say a new smartphone. However, I don’t think an in-person or phone dialogue will be the way people get information, as that’s fairly outdated and doesn’t scale. You will simply tell your smartphone that you want a keyboard that is less than $10 and has a number pad and it will go find the ones that fit that description. You can’t go to the store for pick-up when they become showrooms exclusively, as it makes no sense to hold any inventory there, ie everything will just be delivered. With those exceptions, yes, some fraction of the retail space will be turned into showrooms and everything will be bought online. Reply Share lyle March 16th, 2017 It may work the way web ordering works at Best Buy today that you can pick up your order the next day. Or like Wal-Mart where it can be delivered to the nearest store. However Brick and Mortar have a problem that you might look at the merchandise and the order it on your smart phone. Reply Share Benjamin Cole March 14th, 2017 “That is something that Team Trump should keep in mind as they pursue their misguided public-policy philosophy of jobism, which mistakenly makes the count of jobs the key measure of a country’s economic success or failure.”—-Perry. Well… A nation with labor shortages is a happy nation—and one in which the public can be expected to think “free enterprise seems to work.” The policies of the last 40 years in the US have instead consistently promoted looser labor markets. The fe facto open borders policy; the the de facto Federal Reserve position that at least one in 20 Americans who want work must instead be unemployed; the laws against push-cart vending or truck-vending; the property-zoning laws limiting retailing only to those spaces zoned retail. Though debatable, it appears we tax exports heavier than imports. If the above is the playing field, and I think it is, I do not blame the public for voting for Trump or Sanders. I like more jobs in America. The more the better. I hope to hear whining about “labor shortages.” Music to my ears. Reply Share Michael Hutton March 15th, 2017 I essentially agree with Prof Perry’s take on creative destruction. But….what happens when a free market doesn’t work. Is it possible that market forces can lead a nation in a disastrous direction for any number of reasons? Corporations can, for example, cheat and rig a a free market market in their favor. When that endeavor collapses, resources are not deployed more efficiently. Instead, people’s lives are destroyed through no fault of their own. Does any of that aspect apply here? Reply Share Jon Murphy March 15th, 2017 An answer to your question depends on what you mean by “Corporations can, for example, cheat and rig a a free market market in their favor. “ Reply Share Michael Hutton March 15th, 2017 The ways that corporations cheat are varied and creative. In 2015, the Chicago Sun Times (among others) reported a settlement between the Justice Department and five giant banks that “had engaged in the biggest price-fixing conspiracy in modern history. Their self-described “cartel” used an exclusive electronic chat room and coded language to manipulate the $5.3 trillion-a-day currency exchange market. It was a “brazen display of collusion” that went on for years, said Attorney General Loretta Lynch.” But there will be no trial, no executive will go to jail, the banks can continue to gamble in the same currency markets, and the fines – although large – are a fraction of the banks’ potential gains and will be treated by the banks as costs of doing business. Reply Share Not Sure March 15th, 2017 If the government is letting corporations cheat, you can’t honestly say the problem is that “the free market doesn’t work”, can you? Reply Share Michael Hutton March 15th, 2017 No, that’s not correct. It’s not the government is letting corporations cheat. The issue is that some corporations are not satisfied with taking their best shot in a market or simply trying — through better business models — to achieve a competitive advantage. They’re rigging the free market. Sometimes they are caught and then they stop doing the illegal activity — we hope. But, an unregulated free market will always be abused. How should that be dealt with? We’ve already seen that CEOs and others are not held accountable for illegal actions. We’ve also seen that CEOs are rarely held accountable for being stupid, that is, they rarely suffer the consequences of foolish or ill-advised actions in the market; such as, the risk that Bob Rubin allowed Citigroup to take from 2007-2009. While they were being bailed out by the government, he was raking-in something like $126 million in cash and stock. Anyway, I’ve wandered far afield of the original comment and my question. My question is: are their legitimate actions a government can or should take in the face of creative destruction? Share Ron H. March 15th, 2017 Michael “My question is: are their legitimate actions a government can or should take in the face of creative destruction?” No. No there is not Share Not Sure March 15th, 2017 “It’s not the government is letting corporations cheat.” Who runs the Justice Department? Share Ron H. March 15th, 2017 Not “Who runs the Justice Department?” Hmm. I think you’re on to something. Until recently it was that despicable Loretta Lynch who never indicted a criminal in her entire career. Share Not Sure March 15th, 2017 Wasn’t she working as a government employee in that capacity? Share Dan J March 15th, 2017 Seems a highly regulated market like banking was/is abusive. For over 100years, a bank can’t sneeze without having a regulator there questioning them on whether they sneezed into their hands, arm, or openly allowing droplets to spread. Banks are bent over a barrel, pants down, yet eager as they know govt will protect them from the market. A quid pro quo, but govt has the leverage. Share Ron H. March 15th, 2017 Lynch? Im Not Sure about that. I do know she was a Clinton employee. Share Jon Murphy March 16th, 2017 Michael- Forgive the late reply. It is true that there is nothing capitalists hate more than capitalism, and they will go to extreme lengths to prevent free markets from forming, but most (if not all) of their actions can only be successful though the power of the State. Regulation, protectionism, taxes, etc can all be used by companies to squash competition and the free market. Market manipulations are considerably harder if the market is freer. This is why I asked my question. Knowing what you had in mind helps me shape my answer. As for your example of rate manipulation, I’m afraid I don’t know any specific details, so I won’t comment on that directly, save to make a more generalized point: Cartels and monopolies are sometimes the result of free markets; do not confuse “free market” with “perfectly competitive market.” Indeed, sometimes monopolies can be desirable to perfectly competitive markets (sometimes it’s better to have one seller than no sellers). Share Robert Guzauskas March 15th, 2017 I appreciate Creative Destruction in free markets. Ours are not free. Example: Health care. Insurers and Providers established State laws that restrict business operations and interstate movement and competition. Those laws kill people and bankrupt people and business’. Unregulated Nepotism is another destroyer. Look at Wall Street and Hollywood for examples. Reply Share Jon Murphy March 15th, 2017 So free the markets. Problem solved. Reply Share Ron H. March 15th, 2017 You are channeling Walter Williams here. Reply Share William Ryan March 15th, 2017 Not so sure that the extreme wealth and political power hoarding of Mark Zuckerburg , Bill Gates, Carlos Slim or any other self gratifying oligarch is a good thing for any economy in terms of democracy or sovereignty. We today are dealing with many disruptive technologies that perhaps should not be the sole domain of any one individual. The Wal-Mart effect showed this and so does the Amazon effect. The rate increase today is only for the benefit of the too big to fail China bond holders and Wall St.benefit. This is the controlled creative destruction of animal spirits I see. If you want the real story about how and why these things keep happening go see and Pam Martens at WallStreetonParade.com and get educated. Reply Share Jon Murphy March 16th, 2017 With respect, your comment is long on buzzwords and short on content. Reply Share Greg March 16th, 2017 “Mr. Martens’ career spans four decades in publishing and printing management, including magazine and music publishing and the non-profit sector. Ms. Martens worked on Wall Street for 21 years. Ms. Martens’ earlier career was in publishing.” You won’t learn anything from two publishers who know little about finance or investing. Reply Share Ron H. March 15th, 2017 William “Not so sure that the extreme wealth and political power hoarding of Mark Zuckerburg , Bill Gates, Carlos Slim or any other self gratifying oligarch is a good thing for any economy in terms of democracy or sovereignty.” How did those people become wealthy? Did they provide something to customers that those customers valued to the extent that a lot of customers willing handed over a lot of money to get what these wealthy people were offering? Reply Share Sprewell March 16th, 2017 Yes, let’s look at how they became so rich. Bill Gates worried back in the’90s that big companies would “patent some obvious thing” and come after him, then proceeded to do the same to everyone else. Carlos Slim used connections to wrangle telecom monopolies, minting money as the only option in many markets. Zuckerberg tricked a bunch of people into giving him a lot of their personal data, which he sells to a bunch of advertisers so they can track and market to their customers better. While I’m sure all are competent businessmen, what distinguishes them more than anything else is their sharp elbows in their drive to the top, ie the willingness to make shady decisions in order to get as rich as possible, not just centi-millionaires but billionaires at the top of the list of the world’s richest. In Bill and Carlos’s cases, they used questionable tactics and govt force to keep competition out. Zuck simply profits off the naivety of the public, which will inevitably end badly once the privacy scandals hit. So while William’s probably got some confused case about what to do about all this- no doubt he wants to empower the very govt that these crony capitalists use to get so rich, making the problem worse- he’s not wrong in implying their rise was not exactly clean. Reply Share Ron H. March 16th, 2017 Sprewell “Yes, let’s look at how they became so rich.” Yes, let’s: Gates and Slim enlisted the sharp elbows of government to get as rich as possible. Nothing unusual about that. It is the nature of the game. The solution is to make government elbows unavailable. Nonetheless, money was handed to them by willing customers who valued the product or service more than the money they paid to get it. Zuckerberg offered people something “free” in exchange for their personal information. Whether or not early adopters knew the price they were paying, by now, everyone in the world should be aware of the arrangement, and yet millions find the price acceptable. Reply Share Sprewell March 17th, 2017 Nonetheless, money was handed to them by willing customers who valued the product or service more than the money they paid to get it. No, money was handed to them by unwilling customers who had no choice of other sellers to buy from. That’s the whole point of a monopoly. As for Zuck, his customers are the advertisers, as they’re the ones who pay him, no point in talking about the suckers whose privacy he sells to them. I’m sure he provides the ad guys with plenty of useful data, but they have to wonder how long that will last. Reply Share Ron H. March 17th, 2017 “No, money was handed to them by unwilling customers who had no choice of other sellers to buy from. That’s the whole point of a monopoly.” None of those customers could have bought from Apple? Speaking of monopolies, a study of gates rise riches is a great argument against the patent system. “ I’m sure he provides the ad guys with plenty of useful data, but they have to wonder how long that will last.” I suspect that will last as long as people enjoy using Facebook. I see no lessening of people’s insatiable desire to know what everybody they know is doing today, hour by hour. Reply Share Briguy March 16th, 2017 Wonder what would happen to amazon’s costs if the taxpayer didn’t subsidize the post office and Fedex (through its arrangement to have the post office deliver fedex packages to out of the way locations) and lets not forget amazon’s not paying sales taxes for many, many years. As I see amazon lose control of the quality of its products through the sheer enormity of the vendors it allows to sell through its website ( the descriptions of technical items are often just wrong) I also wonder how much more it can grow Reply Share Jon Murphy March 16th, 2017 Given Amazon is moving toward its own logistics model (drones, delivery trucks, etc), I don’t think your concerns are too warranted. Further, the fact Amazon didn’t pay sales tax has nothing to do with their costs. That’s a cost to the customer. Reply Share Ron H. March 16th, 2017 briguy “Wonder what would happen to amazon’s costs if the taxpayer didn’t subsidize the post office and Fedex (through its arrangement to have the post office deliver fedex packages to out of the way locations …” The USPS charges for every package it delivers. If that charge is inadequate for any reason, including subsidies, your complaint is with the USPS, not Amazon or FedEx. Do you ever complain that you aren’t paying the full cost when you mail something to an out-of-the-way place? Do you attach additional postage to assuage your guilt? Reply Share Briguy March 16th, 2017 John – so if it cost $100 to mail vs $10 it wouldn’t afffect sales? Need to rethink that one! Only the govt could continue that subsidy as long as it has, any private business would have long ago changed their rates, gone out if business, or, like FedEx, figure out how to transfer the loser shipments to someone else Reply Share Jon Murphy March 16th, 2017 Ok…not sure what this has to do with my response to you. Reply Share Briguy March 16th, 2017 So the consumer isn’t aware that they save 8-10% by not paying sales tax? Really? Need to rethink that concept. Reply Share Jon Murphy March 16th, 2017 You’re right. The customer is aware they’re saving 8-10% by not paying sales tax. That’s my whole point: it’s a cost to the consumer, not Amazon. Reply Share William Ryan March 16th, 2017 If your only goal in life is to MSV and nothing for all those who make that possible then you have a fatally flawed business model . Creating wealth and efficiency has to be more than an end to it self. It must be for the benefit of the people in society in general and not just the share holders only interest. Go see Ron and try to learn something because without learning there can be no improvement.

March 16th, 2017 I would imaging the consumer is well aware, and chooses the lower overall price for that reason, but the problem is government manipulation of the market by favoring one type of transaction over another, not the business model of the retailer. Do you recommend charging some consumers higher prices as a remedy? Reply Share Jon Murphy March 17th, 2017 Another thought, Briguy, (which I must admit I am embarrassed I didn’t bring up earlier), on your raised concerns: Eliminating subsidies for the USPS et al and the sales tax thing would be an industry-wide issue, not just Amazon. Yes, Amazon’s costs (shipping) and their customers’ costs (taxes) would rise. So would all their competitors’. You wouldn’t change the relative rankings or even the major point of Mark’s post. Some decimal points may be moved around, but that’s it. Reply Share William Ryan March 17th, 2017 Now you two idiots are going to try to tell me that it is not a political problem but a purely economic problem? More b.s. and more nonsense from the peanut gallery. If the oligarchs who control and dominate most world trade by any measure, which they do. Have extreme wealth hoarding of political power and control ,which they do. And absolute power leads to absolute corruption. And everybody knows this,Then how can you say it is only a surplus or deficit problem of simple accounting book keeping? You are only talking about the numbers off some chart. I’m talking about bringing back real livable wage manufacturing jobs back to America so we make thinks here again and consume our own goods made here again. The specifically targeted BAT will do that and so will the MAC. It was flawed government economic policy set by idiots like you that allowed companies to leave the country to make things cheaper overseas eliminate American jobs and to ship cheaper goods back into the country unfairly and with no penalty. Where was your economic blog back when all that happened? Nowhere to be found as you and many other sat by and did or said nothing about it. The -$500B trade deficit per year just with China may only mean money numbers on charts to you But we are talking about jobs, plants and whole communities devastated by the largest transfer of wealth in the history of the world. This is not political? Please spare me the torture of your ignorance! Reply Share Jon Murphy March 17th, 2017 Simply put, protectionism costs jobs. It does not (in fact, cannot, create them). Further, if the issue is, as you say: ” If the oligarchs who control and dominate most world trade by any measure, which they do. Have extreme wealth hoarding of political power and control ,which they do. And absolute power leads to absolute corruption,” then the issue is to reduce the power of government and the oligarchs in power, not increase it. After all, who do you think is calling for the very protectionist measures you demand? The oligarchs… Reply Share Sprewell March 17th, 2017 Funny how ignorant idiots like yourself see your faults in everyone else. 🙂 There is an easy way to get the outcome you want: go tell all your fellow Americans not to buy Chinese and only buy American. No need to pass laws: they all agree with you about your obvious points, I’m sure. They won’t listen to you? Well, now you know the root of the “problem:” most of your fellow Americans would rather buy cheaply from the Chinese than from you! 😀 Of course, there’s the whole fact that your beloved “real livable wage manufacturing jobs” were an artifact of the post-WWII boom and the global manufacturing base not coming online yet, never to be repeated again. The only jobs left in manufacturing are either highly technical, which your buddies are too dumb to do, or highly painstaking, which millions of Asians are willing to do for pennies, at wages you no doubt think are not livable. Keep dreaming that you can go back into some imagined halcyon past, it’s not going to happen. Reply Share William Ryan March 17th, 2017 Here is more content to shed more light for those still in the dark. http://www.manufacturing.net/news/2017/03/aerospace-industry-calls-congress-pass-tax-plan-including-border-adjustment?abm_pos=7&abm_ Reply Share Not Sure March 17th, 2017 From your link: “The Times noted that Boeing, in particular, stands to benefit from other provisions in the tax package.” Manufacturers support tax policy that provide them with benefits? Who’da thunk it? Reply Share William Ryan March 17th, 2017 Murphy you really have your hat on backwards. It is the wealth hoarding predatory globalist who want to keep their supply chains and MSV ideals of the NWO unchanged or unchallenged. Why do you thing people like Soros gives millions to the DNC and the current establishment not to make any meaningful political changes? You need to read something more than the WAPO , the NYTimes and the MSNM to really know and understand what is really happening with trade and many other things happening in the world today…As for not sure that is an appropriate name to choose since you seem to thing that Wal-Mart junk and toymaking ares more important industries to protect that our national security that manufacturing provides. Intel says they want to spend $7B on new chip making in the US while China plans to spend $150B on chip making in China. Can you see the picture? If we could not make tanks and planes during WWll do you thing we would had won the war? Detroit was the arsenal of democracy and I grew up on the “golden corridor” but I wouldn’t expect you to know anything about that. Reply Share Jon Murphy March 17th, 2017 Again, long on buzzwords short on content. Why do you thing people like Soros gives millions to the DNC and the current establishment not to make any meaningful political changes? Indeed so. Soros, Democrats, and Republicans are constantly fighting against free trade. They’re not fighting to make it so. That’s my whole point. Murphy you really have your hat on backwards. Perhaps, but you’ve not really explained to me why. If the problem is oligarchs control the government and use it to profit, how will increasing the power of the government and increasing the incentive of oligarchs to capture government reduce the problem? Yes, I may just be a simpleton, but that just don’t make sense to me. Surely you, in your enlightened glory, could take pity on a poor fool and explain why I am wrong. Reply Share Not Sure March 17th, 2017 There were a number of strawmen in there, too. Reply Share William Ryan March 17th, 2017 Murphy so called “free trade ” is a buzz word the oligarchs use for one way trade. Got it. If it were really fair and free then we would most likely not be running these huge trade deficits with China and others. WE need greater democratic controls of world trade from America and all trading countries so to follow the rules of the road in global world trading not to be giving any one country and unfair economic advantage. But the root problem being China does not believe in democracy or human rights only in the ever expanding of their military power from the economic surplus we gave them as they created a 20-30-M middle class that is now on par with our wages…The other moronic twit that I keep hearing is that Americans wealth per capita is now at $237,000 per person. This is hog wash as all the wealth gained in the past 10 years has gone to the top 1%. Not a very good way to measure a countries wealth or economic progress as we will surely get the “Canadian Disease” where the citizens get little to no investment from the old wealth hoarding billionaires. Perhaps you should take a look at Michael Hudson’s book “J is for Junk Economics” so you can see the bigger more accurate picture of things economically. Reply Share Jon Murphy March 17th, 2017 Ok…wow. lot going on here. 1) If it were really fair and free then we would most likely not be running these huge trade deficits with China and others. Assertion without evidence. 2) WE need greater democratic controls of world trade from America and all trading countries so to follow the rules of the road in global world trading not to be giving any one country and unfair economic advantage. Long on buzzwords, short on content. 3) But the root problem being China does not believe in democracy or human rights only in the ever expanding of their military power from the economic surplus we gave them Confusing statement given your above rant. 4) as they created a 20-30-M middle class that is now on par with our wages Interesting. The statistics I see say otherwise. Their middle class wages are about 1/10th ours. Their standard of living is about 1/10th ours. 5) “Canadian Disease” This is the third or fourth time I’ve seen this phrase, but I can’t find anything meaning to it. Google reveals nothing Reply Share William Ryan March 17th, 2017 Murphy have you been drinking too much green beer today or what? Let me help teach you a bit. “Canadian Disease” in my notes implies super slow GDP growth. I saw it used by Guy Rolnik on Pro Market @ U. of Chicago Booth School of Business meaning “by using pyramids or monopolies old money often does not grow well”…Over at Manufacturing.Net and EPI.com have shown many articles that state that the Chinese are now on about equal pay with Americans in manufacturing…Greater democratic controls needed for globalism comes from too many books to list here but I,ll give you one. Joe Stiglitz in “Rewriting the rules of the American economy”.

Over at Manufacturing.Net and EPI.com have shown many articles that state that the Chinese are now on about equal pay with Americans in manufacturing… If that’s what they’re reporting, then they’re reporting false information. Reply Share William Ryan March 17th, 2017 Murphy I give up on you because you cannot learn so you fit the definition of an ( ) maybe can fill in the blank… Go see http://chiefexecutive.net/big-companies-reinvesting-american-manufacturing/ Reply Share Jon Murphy March 18th, 2017 Ok. Not sure what you think this link says that supports your contention. It works against you, actually. Reply Share Warren Platts March 19th, 2017 Interesting article on the great success of AMZN, but it’s actually an argument for Hamiltonian protections. In a perfect world, the management of Gander Mountain would redirect their capital and convert their sporting goods retail shops into sporting goods manufacturing, then rehiring the retail staff to be makers, who at least would have a pre-existing knowledge of the sporting goods world. Workers make more money, and management does too because now the number of their customers isn’t limited to a small geographic area, because they’re selling through Amazon. As it is, this cannot happen, because of our free-trade economic policies. We should instead follow the advice of Alexander Hamilton, whose economic theory was the mainstream view for 200 years, and institute some judicious protections for our manufacturing sector–the same thing they do in Germany and China. If, through protections, we can encourage 1 million new manufacturing jobs, 3 million other jobs will be created because of the manufacturing multiplier effect, and could be filled by displaced retail workers. Reply Share Ron H. March 19th, 2017 Warren But where will the extra money come from to pay the higher prices necessary to pay the New American workers? Yours is pretty much the same argument used to advocate for a higher minimum wage. Where does the money for the higher wage come from? Higher manufacturing employment can only result from higher demand for manufactured products, which can only occur if more people have more money to spend. You cannot literally lift yourself by your bootstraps. Increasing the amount and cost of labor doesn’t result in prosperity. Better standards of living result from capital investment, which increases productivity, which reduces the number of jobs required per dollar of output. Maybe it isn’t more jobs that are needed but more output per job so consumers can buy more for the same amount of money. Here’s an example of lot’s of jobs, but I doubt these guys get paid much. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mctUNUQSJCo Reply Share Warren Platts March 20th, 2017 Your analysis ignores the fact that consumers are not just consumers. They are also people that are either working, or on the dole. If the cost of stuff goes up by 20%, but you are making 200% more than the unemployment insurance you were getting, are you better off? A: Yes. Reply Share Jon Murphy March 20th, 2017 For that the hold true, Warren, you’d need such an effect for everyone. Since, by design, tariffs only help a certain group, then it is not true that people will be better off following a tariff hike. Gordon Tullock has written a ton on this matter (as have Adam Smith, David Ricardo, Frederic Bastiat, Milton Friedman, etc). Reply Share Ron H. March 20th, 2017 Warren “Your analysis ignores the fact that consumers are not just consumers. They are also people that are either working, or on the dole. ” Yes, but the ultimate goal of all production is consumption. We produce in order to consume. That which best satisfies each of us as consumers is the best use of productive resources. People sometimes picture production as a goal in itself, but it isn’t. “If the cost of stuff goes up by 20%, but you are making 200% more than the unemployment insurance you were getting, are you better off? A: Yes.” That’s true for those few who become employed, but the many who are already employed become worse off due to the higher prices. There are deadweight losses involved with imposing import tariffs which means that on net, we are worse off as a society, than before. The cost is greater than the benefit.

There are far better ways to shrink the federal budget deficit. By Gene Epstein Biography March 18, 2017 “Anytime I hear border adjustment, I don’t love it,” Donald Trump told The Wall Street Journal shortly before his inauguration, noting that the proposed border adjustment tax was “too complicated.” Trump isn’t always right when he makes off-the-cuff remarks such as that, but this time he was. The proposed border adjustment tax is so complicated that even its advocates can’t agree on how its disruptive effects on the U.S. economy will play out, and there’s nothing to love about that.

Saint Clair police said the crash occurred as Douglas Mennig, 54, of 610 N. Third St., Pottsville, was driving a 2008 Ford Fusion north on Route 61 while a 2008 Chevrolet Silverado, operated by William F. Shafransky, 84, of 21 Trailer Road, Ringtown, was being driven south on Route 61. Police said Shafransky was turning into the Walmart plaza when the two vehicles collided in the intersection. Both drivers were taken to a Pottsville hospital for treatment while two passengers in the Mennig vehicle — Karen Rohrbach and Felicia Baltra, both of 4 Sammy Mobile Home Park, Schuylkill Haven — escaped injury. Police said their investigation into the crash is continuing and that Saint Clair firefighters assisted at the scene. Police: Man harassed woman ASHLAND — A 40-year-old borough man was arrested by state police at Frackville and charged in connection with an incident March 11 at Ashland Bar and Grill. Police said Michael J. Barry became involved in a verbal argument with a 33-year-old Shamokin woman and at some point displayed a 10-inch knife and asked the woman to go outside. Barry was asked to leave the business by staff members but returned later, approached the woman again, prompting the two to become involved in a physical altercation that had to be stopped by patrons. Barry was charged with harassment and disorderly conduct and will now have answer before Magisterial District Judge Christina E. Hale, Frackville, police said.

On Friday, the Glen Carbon Walmart store had been collecting toys, books, clothes, and other necessities that will be given to the children. Store employees also stood outside of the store collecting money from customers. "The community cares about them," said assistant store manager Melinda Maple, "and each of us cares about their well-being and we want to see them thrive and we want to see them do well and we are going to do everything that we can to make sure they are being taken care of." A few miles away at Edwardsville High School, the Little Tigers Football and Edwardsville Wrestling clubs also set up donation boxes to collect items. It's something that many in the community said is a duty and wouldn't think twice about. "We want to be there to show them that it's not just about the tragic loss," said football club president Eddie Lowry. "It's about people coming behind them and we are going to support them and that people are good at heart." There was no shortage of parents, grandparents, and kids doing their part to show their support. "Having three kids, especially an 8-month-old, I just can't imagine what they are going through," said Sean McMeen, a father of three, "but coming out here and just supporting the organizations and the community is just unbelievable and it's what I expect from this area." The store will continue taking donations through the weekend. To make a monetary donation, visit www.littletigersfootball.com.

(AP) — Just because President Trump may weaken U.S. fuel economy requirements, don’t expect gas guzzlers like the giant 13 mpg Hummer H1 to make a comeback. Executives from automakers and suppliers gathered at a conference said looser fuel economy standards might allow for sales of more trucks in areas where they’re popular. But otherwise, the pursuit of fuel-efficiency technologies would proceed unabated. ___ S&P 500 limps to the finish line in another winning week NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks limped into the weekend with mixed results on Friday, but the market nevertheless capped off yet another winning week. Gains for dividend-paying stocks offset drops for banks and health care stocks. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index delivered its seventh week of gains in the last eight, following a big rally sparked by the Federal Reserve’s announcement on interest rates. ___ Wells Fargo CEO: Fixing fake accounts will take more time NEW YORK (AP) — Wells Fargo CEO Tim Sloan said the company could need several more months to resolve customer damage tied to its massive sales practices scandal. That includes figuring out if people had trouble getting approved for other loans because of the fake accounts bank employees opened. Speaking with The Associated Press, Sloan reiterated what he [auth] has said since becoming CEO in the wake of the scandal, that rebuilding trust with customers is the primary focus. ___ NEW YORK (AP) — Trumpism is slowly taking hold on your phone and computer, as the Federal Communications Commission starts chipping away at hard-fought protections on privacy and competition. These measures, put in place before President Donald Trump took office, had upset the phone and cable industries. The new regime says consumers win if businesses face less regulation and have more incentives to invest. ___ Wal-Mart buys online clothing seller ModCloth NEW YORK (AP) — Wal-Mart is buying trendy online clothing selling ModCloth. The company has been making a big push to pick up smaller online brands as it tries to make headway against Amazon. But winning over ModCloth’s customers, who are fans of its vintage-inspired patterned dresses and inclusive sizing, may be a challenge. ___ Slammer sale: Closed prisons are a tough sell, states find ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) — States are having a hard time selling places where prisoners have done hard time. Developers say thick-walled cell blocks and dormitories at closed prisons tend to be too expensive to tear down, and too restrictive to turn into viable enterprises. In New York, a mountaintop site in the Adirondacks has sat on the market for a year despite stunning views and other amenities. ___ US, global partners wrestle over trade stance BADEN-BADEN, Germany (AP) — Top finance officials are debating what stance to take on free trade at a meeting that will help set the tone for the global economy. The gathering of finance ministers and central bank heads from the Group of 20 countries has focused on shifting attitudes toward trade, particularly after U.S. President Donald Trump vowed to impose border taxes and rewrite free trade deals. ___ “Soda tax” stakes escalate in pivotal Philadelphia fight PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Philadelphia has become a pivotal battleground in the beverage industry’s push to stop “soda taxes” from gaining momentum. Since a new tax on sweetened drinks went into effect Jan. 1, a coalition of businesses looking to overturn the tax say sales are down so much they need to cut jobs. Tax supporters question the announcements of layoffs so soon after the tax went into effect, and note beverage distributors and supermarkets aren’t required to pass on the entire cost of the tax to shoppers. ___ Israeli tech firms revving up engines for self-driving cars JERUSALEM (AP) — As the world moves toward an era of self-driving cars, Israel is positioning itself to be the Detroit of the future. The country has emerged as a global leader in the fast-growing field of driverless cars, as illustrated by Intel’s more than $15 billion acquisition of Israeli firm Mobileye this week. ___ Dallas offers cautionary tale as it moves to fix 911 woes DALLAS (AP) — Dallas has been experiencing disruptions in its 911 service that began in October and at one point last week resulted in 360 calls being placed on hold. More dispatchers have been assigned to field 911 calls and technological glitches have been fixed, which should smooth operations, a city spokeswoman said Friday. But the problems plaguing Dallas can be found with other 911 systems that rely on increasingly obsolete networks that are incompatible with new technologies and protocols. ___ The Dow Jones industrial average fell 19.93 points, or 0.1 percent, to 20,914.62. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index slipped 3.13 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,378.25. The Nasdaq composite rose 0.24 points, or 0.004 percent, to 5,901.00. Benchmark U.S. crude rose 3 cents to settle at $48.78 per barrel. Brent crude, which is used to price international oils, rose 2 cents to $51.76 per barrel. Natural gas rose 5 cents to $2.95 per 1,000 cubic feet. Wholesale gasoline inched up less than a cent to $1.60 per gallon, and heating oil rose a fraction of a penny to $1.51 per gallon.

MST March 17, 2017 A Phoenix police officer arrests a woman in a car at a Walmart March 17, 2017. (Photo: Screengrab from Facebook) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST PHOENIX - A Phoenix Walmart parking lot erupted in screams and vulgarities as a police officer forcefully arrested a woman accused of shoplifting Thursday afternoon. The woman, 26-year-old Delores Imboden, shouted that the officer was choking her while inside a car in the parking lot. Dozens of people gathered around with cellphones to record the violent arrest, during which the officer hit Imboden and threatened to shoot as she fought against being handcuffed and taken out of the car. Police say Imboden bit the officer before he "used strikes to prevent any further injury to himself." According to police, the bite came as the officer reached to turn off the car, which the driver refused to do. The video is on Facebook and may be upsetting to some viewers. Police have not provided the officer's name. Police say the driver, now-arrested Steven Katzeek, was holding on to Imboden, keeping the officer from pulling her out of the car. They also said Katzeek began driving forward slowly during the altercation. Police officials said security personnel and the officer, who was working off-duty in the area, had monitored Imboden via security camera in the store as she put merchandise in a duffel bag and started walking toward the exit. According to police, as the officer approached the exit, Imboden put down the bag and ran for the exit, getting into the car driven by Katzeek. The video begins shortly after, with the officer on top of Imboden, trying to handcuff her. Eventually, she was dragged out of the car by two officers and handcuffed. A third officer got Katzeek out of the car and handcuffed him. Police said they recovered stolen merchandise and drug paraphernalia from the scene. Imboden was booked on one count of resisting arrest and one count of shoplifting. Katzeek was booked on one count of hindering prosecution. © 2017 KPNX-TV CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST JOIN THE CONVERSATION To find out more about Facebook commenting please read the Conversation Guidelines and FAQs Leave a Comment TRENDING VIDEOS Anti-Trump billboard artist gets death threats Two crashes results in 3 deaths, 16th patients Shoplifting arrest caught on camera Giraffe Birth Facts Controversial billboard of President Trump in Phoenix Must-watch: Rock-crawling buggy lands amazing drop Arizona Teachers: Underpaid and overburdened Wheat heart 3 secrets to finding deals on Amazon Fatal crash on I-17 at Pinnacle Peak More Stories 9-year-old boy shot, killed in north Phoenix Mar 20, 2017, 3:05 p.m. High school teacher explains why she 'loathes'… Mar 20, 2017, 6:13 p.m. Man arrested, suspected of having sex with goat Mar 20, 2017, 1:17 p.m. About Us Contact Us Reporters Index Help Connect With Us FCC Online Public Inspection File • EEO Public File Report Home Weather 7 Day Forecast Health Detail Weather Alerts Closings & Delays Location Search Conditions More...

Ross was referencing Snoop Dogg’s music video for “Lavender,” which features a scene in which a gun that shoots a flag reading “BANG” is pulled on a clown Trump lookalike. “Can you imagine what the outcry would be if @SnoopDogg, failing career and all, had aimed and fired the gun at President Obama? Jail time!” Trump tweeted Wednesday, three days after the video’s release. Ross, who has been an ardent critic of the President, is no stranger to Trump-related music controversies himself. In his 2015 song, “Free Enterprise,” he raps about assassinating Trump: “Assassinate Trump like I’m Zimmerman / Now accept these words as they came from Eminem.” Billboard reported in December 2015 that Walmart allegedly pulled Ross’ album off the shelves because of the lyric. Walmart did not return Billboard’s requests for comment. Ross has never shied away from expressing his political views, and his newest album touches on the issues he cares about. “The title, ‘Rather You Than Me,’ that’s just the perspective of a young black dude coming up in an urban community,” the Florida rapper said. “As soon as the music come on, just let the music talk to you. You know I’ve always been open and I speak my mind on whatever the topic may be.” The album, released Friday, includes songs like “Dead Presidents,” featuring Jeezy, Yo Gotti and Future, “Powers that Be,” featuring New York rapper Nas and “Maybach Music V,” featuring DeJ Loaf, which Ross described as “a really airy type of feeling record.” The hip-hop star got political at the Woodie Awards, which recognizes the music voted best by college students, telling the audience during the live broadcast on MTV that in this divided time, it’s good to get together and be united by music. “The Woodies always been cool to me because it was a spot you can see artists while they’re still underground, before they’ve achieved mainstream success,” he told CNN. “When I came and performed at the Woodies, that was real big for me.” El Paso R&B artist Khalid, who performed his hit “Location” at the show, won “Woodie to Watch,” and The Chainsmokers, who presented Khalid with the award, won “Woodie of the Year.” Ross told audiences during the live MTV broadcast that he would make a great president because he would “pass the kind of laws we can support,” and asked them to “Vote Rozay” — a reference to the rapper’s nickname, “Ricky Rozay.” He jokingly outlined his platform, but also touched on issues that he cares about, such as marijuana legalization: “No. 1, we make Ice Cube’s birthday a federal holiday. Free haircuts at the barbershop on Fridays,” Ross joked. “No. 2, you all have to go out and buy my new album available at 12 a.m., baby! Of course, I’ll legalize marijuana everywhere. God bless, everybody! Vote Rozay!” His remarks drew loud cheers from the audience. Ross said this was his first time “hosting anything,” adding that above all, he knew he would have a good time doing it. “Me being a boss, I’m only going to have a good time,” he said. “That’s the only thing that matters.” Secret Service: White House jumper was captured after more than 15 minutes Russian bank claims effort to frame it for connections to Trump Organization Related Posts House approves bill barring taxpayer money for abortions Perry and Trump trade shots over border security Mitt Romney’s son considering Utah gubernatorial run Melania Trump’s speech plagiarizes parts of Michelle Obama’s Leave a Reply Cancel reply You must be logged in to post a comment.

Switch prompts online traffic boost for US retailers by Ben Parfitt Wednesday, March 15th 2017 at 10:49AM GMT Print this page Email Share on Twitter Share on Facebook Share on Google Share on LinkedIn The launch of the Nintendo Switch earlier this month saw all major US retailers enjoy a boost to their online traffic. VentureBeat reports that data from analyst SimilarWeb shows that both GameStop and Toys R Us saw monthly traffic peaks on the day Switch launched – March 3rd. Traffic from Nintendo.com also had a measurable year-on-year impact on sites such as Amazon and Toys R Us. The site also pushed referral traffic to GameStop, Best Buy, Walmart and Target. Looking at Amazon in isolation, Nintendo.com sent 1.4m clicks Amazon’s way in the month leading up to Switch’s launch. The boost for the Toys R Us website was big, too, with February traffic up 813 per cent over January. Looking at overall web activity, GameStop grabbed over three per cent of all search traffic for the term ‘Switch’ in the launch run-up, although again Toys R Us, Best Buy, Walmart and Target all enjoyed similar bumps. March 3rd itself was also a big day for Nintendo.com, although the numbers weren’t able to match the frenzy that followed the Switch’s official video reveal in January. Neither of these were able to measure up to the traffic generated by launch of smartphone title Miitomo, either, which generated 1.7m visitors to the platform holder’s official site. Switch launch day, meanwhile, attracted just under 1m. Analyst SuperData yesterday said that it believes Nintendo sold 1.5 Switch consoles worldwide. The number was calculated by adding together the estimated 500k US sales, 360k Japanese sales and data from across Europe. Switch sold around 80k in the UK, for instance, and an estimated 110k in France. Nintendo had previously said that it aimed to sell 2m Switch consoles by the end of the month – a number it looks to have a good chance of now hitting. The big driver is the critical smash that is The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, which SuperData says was purchased by 89 per cent of Switch owners. That of course means nearly 1.35m sales for the game on Switch alone, to which sales on Wii U must be added.

About 6,700 pizzas sold under Wal-Mart’s Marketside brand were affected by the recall, a representative of the supplier said on Thursday. RBR Meat Company recalled about 21,220 pounds of Marketside Extra Large Supreme Pizza that were shipped to retail distribution centers in California, Nevada, Utah and Washington, the USDA said on Wednesday. The product carries the code 20547. Wal-Mart and the USDA said they were unaware of illnesses linked to the pizzas. The retailer said it started removing the products from its shelves and inventory as soon as it received notice of the recall from Rose and Shore, a food company affiliated with Vernon, California-based RBR. The pizzas were available in California, Colorado, Nevada, Washington state, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Utah, Wyoming, Alaska and Hawaii, Wal-Mart said. Sam’s Club was not affected. People should not eat the pizzas, according to the USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service. It said RBR discovered the possible Listeria contamination during routine sampling. Listeriosis is a serious illness caused by eating food contaminated with Listeria bacteria, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The infection is most likely to sicken pregnant women and babies, adults older than 65, and people with weakened immune systems. An estimated 1,600 people contract listeriosis each year and about 260 die, according to the CDC. In an unrelated case, the CDC is investigating a multistate outbreak of listeriosis linked to the consumption of soft raw milk cheese made by Vulto Creamery that has led to two deaths.

ModCloth will continue to operate its website and bricks-and-mortar store, located in Austin, Texas, as a complement to Wal-Mart's other e-commerce sites. In recent weeks, Wal-Mart has acquired other e-commerce sites, including Moosejaw, an outdoor retailer, and Shoebuy. ModCloth was founded in 2002 and had been headquartered in San Francisco since 2009, with offices in Los Angeles and Pittsburgh. ModCloth Chief Executive Matthew Kaness, along with his executive team, and more than 300 employees, will continue to run the business. Wal-Mart shares are up 0.3% in Friday trading, and 4.7% for the last year. The S&P 500 index is up 16.6% for the past 12 months, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up nearly 20% for the period.

The company declined to specify the price on the deal that closed Friday, saying only that it was in the same range as its previous two purchases of online businesses. Those were $51 million and $70 million. Wal-Mart is working hard to attract younger and more affluent shoppers, but winning over ModCloth's devoted customers, fans of its vintage-inspired patterned dresses, inclusive sizing and community feel, may be a challenge. Many expressed their disappointment on social media when they heard talk of a deal with Wal-Mart. Bentonville, Arkansas-based Wal-Mart said ModCloth will continue to operate as a stand-alone and complementary brand to its other e-commerce sites, and will bring experience and talent to strengthening the company's fashion business aimed at millennials. Independent designers who sell on ModCloth's site, it said, will gain the opportunity to expand their reach. ModCloth CEO Matthew Kaness, his executive team and the company's 300-plus employees will stay based in San Francisco, Los Angeles and Pittsburgh, and will join Wal-Mart's U.S. e-commerce retail organization. Wal-Mart spent more than $3 billion for upstart Jet.com last year and since then has purchased other smaller companies, including online footwear retailer ShoeBuy.com and the outdoor gear seller Moosejaw. Marc Lore, the founder of Jet.com who is now CEO of Walmart.com, said last month that the company was still looking for new startups to buy. ModCloth, founded in 2002, has one physical store in Austin, Texas. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The Marketside pizza is produced exclusively for Walmart and was shipped to distribution centers in California, Utah, Washington, and Nevada. The recalled pizzas were produced on February 23rd and carry the product code 20547. An RBR supplier representative told the Huffington Post that about 6,700 sold pizzas were affected, so if you recently purchased a Marketside pizza, throw it out immediately or return it to the place you purchased it.

Listeria symptoms often mimic those of the flu and can be deadly to the elderly and those with weakened or compromised immune systems. Pregnant women are also at particular risk, as the infection can cause miscarriages and birth defects. Symptoms generally appear a few days to a few weeks after eating the contaminated item.

The company did not reveal the purchase price.   ModCloth is Walmart’s fourth online acquisition since September, when it completed its purchase of Jet.com. In December, the chain bought Shoebuy, and in February it acquired outdoor apparel retailer Moosejaw. Shoebuy, Moosejaw and ModCloth all target younger and more affluent customers than those that make up Walmart’s core audience.    Founded in 2002, ModCloth sells its own vintage-inspired branded merchandise in a full range of sizes, along with a curated selection of styles from hundreds of indie designers. The brand enjoys a strong social media following. The company has made several forays into brick-and-mortar, including pop-up sites along with a permanent store in Austin, Texas.     Similar to the model Walmart has used with its other online acquisitions, the ModCloth team will continue to operate its site and store as a standalone and complementary brand to Walmart’s e-commerce sites. ModCloth CEO Matthew Kaness, his executive team, and the company’s 300-plus employees will continue to be based in San Francisco, Los Angeles and Pittsburgh, and will join Walmart’s U.S. e-commerce retail organization.   “Designers that sell on ModCloth who are interested in expanding their consumer reach will now have the opportunity to serve more customers through Jet.com and our other e-commerce sites,” Walmart stated.   In a statement on her blog, ModCloth co-founder Susan Gregg Koger said that the acquisition will give ModCloth the resources and support it needs as a business to grow, including in the brick-and-mortar space.    “Growth allows us to reach more women, grow our community, and amplify our message,” Gregg stated. “Our mission to help our customers feel like the best version of themselves continues. And our commitment to inclusivity continues. Our amazing team continues. And we can open more stores — in your hometown!   Click here to read Gregg’s full statement.  Login or Register to post a comment. ﻿ Newsletter Sign Up Get the latest news sent to your inbox   Popular Most Commented The world’s most valuable retail brands are… Confirmed: Walmart acquires another online retailer Walgreens makes executive moves Report: Walmart to acquire another online retailer Report: Walmart testing kiosks to create ‘an endless aisle’ President-elect hurting traffic at some major retail flagships Rebecca Minkoff puts virtual mirror into shoppers hands Dollar Tree comes out on top Restaurant giant in $1.8 billion acquisition German grocery giant to make a big U.S. debut ahead of schedule Solutions Spotlight Taking Stock of Retail’s Analytics Capabilities When it comes to using data and analytics to drive business results, where does the retail industry stand relative to other industries?

The SSA’s Office of the Inspector General has received several reports from citizens who have received phone calls from scammers posing as OIG investigators saying the citizen’s Social Security account, number and/or benefits are suspended. The scammers then direct the victim to call a non-SSA phone number to “resolve the issues.” Here is what you should know if these scammers contact you: • Do not call this number as it is an attempt to get your personal information fraudulently. • Details of the scam may vary, refuse to give out sensitive information over the phone. • OIG investigators do contact citizens by phone but never ask for sensitive information over the phone. • Report suspicious calls to the OIG at 1-800-269-0271 or online at oig.ssa.gov/report.

Staff report Two people are facing charges after allegedly shoplifting from Wal-Mart in Lincolnton early Wednesday morning. Lincolnton Police Department officers said Logan David Turner, 29, and Emilee Louise MacCarroll, 26, both of 1247 Blackwood Street in Gastonia, were confronted by officers as they attempted to leave the store and that the pair ran outside into the parking lot, where they threw away the stolen merchandise. They were apprehended after a brief pursuit, according to a press release from the Lincolnton Police Department. Officers said Turner had removed anti-theft devices from the merchandise, which upgraded his theft charge to a felony. Officers said they also found a small amount of heroin in Turner’s possession. Turner was charged with felony larceny by removal of anti-theft device, felony possession of heroin and possession of drug paraphernalia and was issued an $11,000 secured bond. Officers said Turner has prior felony convictions of fleeing to elude arrest, possession of methamphetamine, identity theft, safecracking, conspiracy, second degree burglary and breaking and entering and prior misdemeanor convictions for resisting an officer and is currently on probation. MacCarroll was charged with misdemeanor larceny and given a $1,000 secured bond. She has charges pending in Gaston County for felony possession of a schedule II controlled substance.

RBR Meat Company Inc. issued the recall for its Marketside Extra Large Supreme Pizza after possible listeria was discovered during routine sampling. The product was available for purchase in Walmart store locations across California, Colorado, Nevada, Washington state, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Utah, Wyoming, Alaska and Hawaii. According to a news release on the USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) the products were produced on Feb. 23 and are packaged in a 50.6-ounce corrugated box containing one shrink-wrapped 16-inch pizza with lot code 20547. More on this... At least 2 dead in multi-state listeria outbreak linked to cheese Ohio company recalls more than 40,000 pounds of veal Evanger's expands dog food recall over potential death drug contamination According to FSIS, no illnesses tied to the recall had been reported as of March 15. However, consumers who have the product in their freezer or who have purchased it are urged to discard of it or return it for a refund. The recall comes amid a deadly listeria outbreak linked to a New York-based creamery that has resulted in at least six illnesses and two fatalities. Consuming foods contaminated with listeria could cause fever, muscle aches, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance, convulsions, diarrhea or other stomach issues. Pregnant women who are exposed to listeria may suffer miscarriage, stillbirths or premature delivery. Those with compromised immune systems are also considered at an increased risk of health complications after exposure. Consumers with additional questions may contact FSIS at AskKaren.gov or 1-888-674-6854.    Advertisement Trending in Health 1 The dangers of strep throat 2 Studies shed light on opioid exposures among US children and young adults 3 Woman loses fingers, toes after deadly strep throat infection 4 Care guidelines for cancer survivors often unclear 5 Officials investigating patient's death after butt lift procedure at Miami clinic See all Trends Top Health Centers View All Back Pain Cancer Depression Heart Disease Pain Management Sexual Health Beauty & Skin Cold and Flu Digestive Health Nutrition Pregnancy Site Index Sections Home Video Politics U.S. Opinion Entertainment Tech Science Health Travel Lifestyle World Sports Weather On Air Tools Live Video Trending Newsletters Alerts Podcasts Radio Apps & Products About Careers College Students Fox Around the World Advertise With Us New Terms of Use (What's New) New Privacy Policy Ad Choices Help Email Newsroom Media Relations Closed Captioning Policy Follow Facebook Twitter Google+ Instagram RSS Newsletters Fox News Back to Top This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2017 FOX News Network, LLC.

LOUIS - A fast-acting paramedic dove into the frigid water of an Illinois lake where a SUV was submerged and found an infant floating inside, then administered CPR on the hood and swam the child to shore, authorities said. The baby is expected to make a full recovery. The infant was one of seven siblings who survived a tragic chain of events in which a father was found shot dead in a burning home and a mother was found drowned in the lake from which the baby was rescued, reports CBS affiliate KMOV. Cristy Campbell’s body was found inside an SUV submerged in a frigid lake. Her 3-month-old son was also in the vehicle and was rescued by a paramedic KMOV It all began at 5:15 a.m. Thursday in Glen Carbon, Illinois, when fire broke out at a home owned by Cristy Lynn Campbell, 32. Six children, siblings ranging up to age 14, escaped.  Campbell’s estranged husband and the father of the children, Justin Campbell, was found dead in the home, but the Madison County Coroner’s Office determined Friday he died of a gunshot wound and not as a result of the fire, reports KMOV. It’s not clear how he was shot, or how the fire started. Glen Carbon is about 30 miles east of St. Louis.   Some of the children ran to a nearby Wal-Mart, others to a home in the neighborhood. The kids at the Wal-Mart asked an arriving worker to call 911, Sheriff John Lakin said. Cristy Campbell was not in the home when firefighters arrived, nor was the couple’s seventh child, a 3-month-old boy. At 5:31 a.m., a motorist passing near Silver Lake in Highland, Illinois, about 16 miles from the home, saw a car heading down a hill toward the water and called 911, Lakin said. Highland paramedic Todd Zobrist arrived quickly, jumped into the 46-degree water and swam 50 to 75 feet to the SUV, where he found a baby floating inside the car. He pulled the baby by the arm to the hood of the SUV, where he began CPR, then swam with the child to shore. The child, initially unresponsive, is expected to recover and could be released Friday from a hospital in St. Charles, Missouri, Lakin said. “Today was a tragic day all the way around because of both scenes,” Lakin said Thursday. “Fortunately, there is something good that can come of this.” Highland Emergency Medical Services chief Brian Wilson said Zobrist’s actions were heroic. “He definitely saved the child’s life,” Wilson said. After finding the baby, authorities began searching the water. A body was pulled from the lake around 11:15 a.m. CBS affiliate KMOV reports that police have identified the body in the submerged SUV as Cristy Campbell.  A weapon was also found in the submerged car, reports KMOV.   Firefighters on the scene on a fatal house fire in Glen Carbon, Ill. Paige Hulsey / KMOV Court records showed that Cristy Campbell and Justin Campbell, 37, had a volatile relationship. In 2005, before they were married, Justin Campbell was charged with domestic abuse for allegedly attacking Cristy Campbell, then known as Cristy Brueggemann, by slapping her in the head when she was pregnant. He was sentenced in March 2006 to probation and fined $500. Despite the violence, they wed on Nov. 3, 2006. She filed for legal separation in September 2010, but the matter was dismissed two months later. In April 2012, Cristy Campbell obtained an emergency protection order against her husband and filed for divorce, alleging in court papers that he “abuses me on a weekly basis,” including punching and choking her. “He has told me that I’m a no good wife,” Campbell wrote in her application for the protection order. The divorce was granted in February 2013. Lakin said Glen Carbon police have answered several calls to Campbell’s home, including some “domestic-related situations,” but he declined to elaborate. “The Glen Carbon Police Department was aware of that house,” Lakin said. Authorities said the children are with Illinois authorities and will be placed with relatives. © 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Tech Apple Science Cars Geneva Motor Show Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 Nintendo NES     Nintendo Switch Stock Updates Posted: Mar 21 2017, 1:25am CDT | by Luigi Lugmayr, in News | Technology News     The new $299.99 Nintendo Switch is hard to find. Updated. Update: Starting on March 22, GameStop stores will have the $299.99 Nintendo Switch in stock. GameStop has announced that the retailer received new Switch inventory from Nintendo. Don't Miss: Win a FREE Nintendo Switch in our Giveaway The Switch will only be available in stores and not online. We have visited three GameStop store locations and talked to the sales associates about how to get a Nintendo Switch on Wednesday. Find out how to buy a Nintendo Switch on Wednesday. Quick Links: Buy the Nintendo Switch on Amazon.com  Enter to win the Switch in our Giveaway ending soon The new Nintendo Switch was launched on March 3. As expected, it sold out on launch day. Nintendo's comments that there would be enough Switch consoles in March to satisfy demand turned out to be untrue. Nintendo plans to double the production of the Nintendo Switch. The company plans to make 16 million Switch consoles starting April 1 until March 2018. The original plan was to produce 8 million Switch consoles. The reseller prices of the Nintendo Switch have honed in on about $470 for the Switch with Gray Joy-Con and $489.99 for the Switch with Neon Red and Blue Joy-Con. The colorful Switch is slightly harder to find than the console with gray controllers. The premium resellers charge is with 50 to 65% still much lower than it is the case for the Nintendo NES Classic. Amazon has been offering the hard to find Nintendo Switch through its local delivery service Amazon Prime Now. We tracked the Nintendo Switch with Neon Joy-Con in stock for select cities on Amazon Prime Now last week. Customers report on social media to have found the Switch on Amazon Prime Now in their city in the past days. The Lucky customers can receive the Switch with 2 hour free delivery once the Amazon Prime Now. Some Prime Now shoppers have their orders shipped to a UPS store and than forwarded to an address outside the Amazon Prime Now delivery area. Target has started to offer the Nintendo Switch online on Monday. Inventory sold out extremely fast. Also Jet.com had some Switch consoles on sale online. Some lucky shoppers spotted the Switch on sale at kohls.com on March 16. No tracker is monitoring Kohls, but the inventory still sold out in minutes. Walmart had the Switch on sale on walmart.com on Tuesday, March 14, but might have totally over sold the console. Buyers report that their order is "undefined." The common theme is that their order is backordered. More and more US shoppers are now ordering the Nintendo Switch at Amazon in Spain and also on Amazon UK. This works the same way as for the NES Classic. Amazon UK offers the Nintendo Switch for £279.99 (~ $341) with an in stock date fo on March 31, 2017. Amazon Spain offers the Nintendo Switch for 319 Euro (~ $338), but is currently sold out. The only other option to find a Nintendo Switch we know of are the $500 GameStop Switch bundles with April delivery and of course our Nintendo Switch Giveaway. The video game retailer has started to take pre-orders for the Nintendo Switch with a mid-April delivery date on March 7.  GameStop is offering a $599.99 Nintendo Switch bundle for pre-order with a delivery of April 16th online. Right now the $599.99 Switch bundle is market as unveilable. The release date is now set for March 31. The delivery is still April 16. GameStop also offers a $509.99 Nintendo Switch Bundle, but that is only available for pre-order in stores. The $599.99 Nintendo Switch with Gray Joy-Con Console Starter Bundle Two includes: Nintendo Switch with Gray Joy-Con Console, Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Expansion Pass, Snipperclips, Just Dance 2017, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild The Complete Official Guide, Nintendo Switch Joy-Con Charging Dock, Nintendo Switch Hybrid Cover, SanDisk Ultra 64GB microSD Card with Adapter, and Power Kit AC-Adapter for Switch. The bundle features sensible items, but not all consumers will need all that stuff. This expensive Nintendo Switch bundle is available for pre-order on gamestop.com. You can also try your luck and win a new Nintendo Switch and a Nintendo NES Classic in our two exclusive I4U News Giveaways. We have both hot Nintendo consoles in the office and are giving them away this month. GameStop says that the Digital Season Pass Code and Digital Game Code Download Instructions will be emailed when orders ship. Items in this bundle may ship separately. GameStop also warns that any products that were sold as part of a bundle are not allowed for return, unless the bundle is returned complete and in sealed new condition. No other store is currently offering the Nintendo Switch online. Below is the list of shops that have carried the Switch at launch. Amazon  Best Buy  GameStop  Target  ToysRUs Nintendo lists six official stores that sell the Nintendo Switch including Amazon, Best Buy, GameStop, Walmart, ToysRUs and Target. Other stores have also listed the Switch including NewEgg, Fry's, BHPPhotoVideo and Nintendo's own store. We expect the Switch to be sold out after Friday and go down a similar route as other successful Nintendo consoles before i t. The Wii was a hard to find console and the surprise NES Classic hit is still very hard to find months after its release. The Nintendo Switch is expected to sell out on launch day and will be hard to find for weeks or even months after launch. Resellers are already preparing to snag up as many Switch consoles to resell them on eBay. Resellers have not yet settled on a profit margin as it is not clear yet how hard the Switch will be to find on launch day. The listings prices are all over the place, ranging from $400 to $1,000. We already received a Nintendo Switch on Thursday that we are giving away. Enter the I4U News Nintendo Switch Giveaway now to get a chance to win a free Nintendo Switch. Nintendo is expected to ship 2 million Switch consoles in March for the global market. The number is too low and finding Nintendo Switch in stock after the initial launch batch sells out is very difficult. The Switch gave Nintendo their biggest console launch ever. The first 2-days of sales beat the Wii and all other Nintendo consoles. The $59.99 NES Classic continues to be also in extreme short supply and Nintendo is unable to ship a significant resupply to resellers in weeks. Nintendo sold through 1.5 million NES Classic consoles and the demand is by far not satisfied. It might take Nintendo until Fall to make enough Switch consoles to satisfy demand. The Switch will be one of the most popular Holiday gifts for the Holiday shopping season 2017.  For video game fans who have not pre-ordered a Switch yet, there are still chances on launch day. There have been midnight launches for the Nintendo Switch at several retailers. The online availability of the Switch is expected to be very limited on launch day. How to Find a Nintendo Switch in stock online To track online inventory and get alerts, shoppers can use zoolert and NowInStock. Both inventory tracker have already setup the Nintendo Switch trackers. We also recommend to use the Chrome browser extension Page Monitor Pro to monitor Nintendo Switch product pages in the hours ahead of the release. How to Find a Nintendo Switch in stock in stores Once the Switch is released, consumers can use BrickSeek to try to find a Switch in stock at Walmart Stores and Target Stores. The Target DPCI for the Nintendo Switch console with neon blue and neon red Joy-Con is 207-29-1001. The DPCI for the Nintendo Switch with grey Joy-Con is 207-29-1000. The Walmart SKU number for the Nintendo Switch with grey Joy-Con is 52901821. The Walmart SKU for the Nintendo Switch with neon blue and new red Joy-Con is 52901822. We will provide continuous updates about the availability of the Nintendo Switch. The Nintendo Switch is a completely new video game concept. It's a mobile console first with removable small controllers. The mobile unit with display rest in a Nintendo Switch console connected to your TV. The mobile unit slides inside the Switch docking station, where it also gets charged. The small controllers that are detachable from the mobile unit also slide onto a home controller. A new Zelda game will be amongst the launch titles for the new Nintendo Switch, formerly known as Nintendo NX. The Nintendo Switch games sell for $59.99 like the games for the PS4 and Xbox One. The announced Nintendo Switch game line-up includes Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Nintendo killed region locking on the Nintendo Switch.

(Laurie Skrivan/AP) Illinois paramedic saves infant from SUV submerged in frigid lake Add to ... Jim Salter ST. LOUIS — The Associated Press Published Friday, Mar. 17, 2017 8:36AM EDT Last updated Friday, Mar. 17, 2017 8:40AM EDT Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print A fast-acting paramedic dove into the frigid water of an Illinois lake where a SUV was submerged and found an infant floating inside, then administered CPR on the hood and swam the child to shore, authorities said. The baby is expected to make a full recovery. The infant was one of seven siblings who survived a tragic chain of events that left one person dead in a house fire and second body recovered from the lake where the baby was found. It all began at 5:15 a.m. Thursday in Glen Carbon, Illinois, when fire broke out at a home owned by Cristy Lynn Campbell. An adult died in the fire but six children, siblings ranging up to age 14, escaped. Glen Carbon is about 30 miles east of St. Louis. Sheriff John Lakin said the person killed has not been identified, but Campbell’s estranged husband and the father of the children, Justin Campbell, has not been accounted for. Some of the children ran to a nearby Wal-Mart, others to a home in the neighbourhood. The kids at the Wal-Mart asked an arriving worker to call 911, Lakin said. Cristy Campbell was not in the home when firefighters arrived, nor was the couple’s seventh child, a 3-month-old boy. At 5:31 a.m., a motorist passing near Silver Lake in Highland, Illinois, about 16 miles from the home, saw a car heading down a hill toward the water and called 911, Lakin said. Highland paramedic Todd Zobrist arrived quickly, jumped into the 46-degree water and swam 50 to 75 feet to the SUV, where he found a baby floating inside the car. He pulled the baby by the arm to the hood of the SUV, where he began CPR, then swam with the child to shore. The child, initially unresponsive, is expected to recover and could be released Friday from a hospital in St. Charles, Missouri, Lakin said. “Today was a tragic day all the way around because of both scenes,” Lakin said Thursday. “Fortunately, there is something good that can come of this.” Highland Emergency Medical Services chief Brian Wilson said Zobrist’s actions were heroic. “He definitely saved the child’s life,” Wilson said. After finding the baby, authorities began searching the water. A body was pulled from the lake around 11:15 a.m. While the body has not been identified, Lakin said police are no longer searching for Cristy Campbell. Court records showed that Cristy Campbell and Justin Campbell, 37, had a volatile relationship. In 2005, before they were married, Justin Campbell was charged with domestic abuse for allegedly attacking Cristy Campbell, then known as Cristy Brueggemann, by slapping her in the head when she was pregnant. He was sentenced in March 2006 to probation and fined $500. Despite the violence, they wed on Nov. 3, 2006. She filed for legal separation in September 2010, but the matter was dismissed two months later. In April 2012, Cristy Campbell obtained an emergency protection order against her husband and filed for divorce, alleging in court papers that he “abuses me on a weekly basis,” including punching and choking her. “He has told me that I’m a no good wife,” Campbell wrote in her application for the protection order. The divorce was granted in February 2013. Lakin said Glen Carbon police have answered several calls to Campbell’s home, including some “domestic-related situations,” but he declined to elaborate. “The Glen Carbon Police Department was aware of that house,” Lakin said. Authorities said the children are with Illinois authorities and will be placed with relatives.

LOUIS — A man found dead inside a burned home in southern Illinois had been shot in the head, and a gun was found in his ex-wife’s SUV after she drove into a nearby lake and died shortly after the fire was reported, authorities said Friday. The pair’s infant son was pulled from the submerged SUV by a paramedic who swam through frigid water, quickly realized a baby and not a doll was floating inside, and performed CPR on the boy atop the vehicle’s roof. Six other children safely escaped the Thursday fire at the house, where the divorced parents — who had a history of domestic violence — both lived. Preliminary autopsy results released Friday show 37-year-old Justin Campbell died from the gunshot wound. But testing can’t be done to determine whether the gun found in Cristy Campbell’s SUV was used to shoot Campbell because the bullet that struck him hasn’t been found, according to Madison County Coroner Steve Nonn. Nonn later told The Associated Press that nothing in the investigation or autopsy suggests the gunshot wound was self-inflected. Police said the tangled chain of events began when some of the children ran to a Walmart store near their home around 5:15 a.m. Thursday in Glen Carbon, Ill. They told an arriving worker to call 911 because their house was on fire. Responding firefighters found Justin Campbell’s body. About 16 minutes later, a motorist called 911 after seeing an SUV travel down a hill and into Silver Lake in Highland, about 16 miles away from the house. Paramedics Todd Zobrist and Ty Barr arrived minutes later. Zobrist said he could see headlights in the water and knew there might be someone inside the SUV, which was submerged in about five feet of water. He stripped off his shirt, socks and boots, and swam 75 feet to the vehicle. “When I got halfway there I was thoroughly thinking to myself, ’This is a terrible decision and I really need to just turn around and go back to the dock because I’m going to get myself in a lot of trouble,”’ Zobrist said at a news conference Friday. “At that point, though, I was committed, I was already wet, I was already cold.” Dark outside and difficult to see, he found the only access inside the vehicle was through an open driver’s side window. Zobrist peered into the back seat — and saw something. “It looked like two feet and two hands,” he said. “And at first I thought it was just a doll, a kid’s toy of some sort.” It was three-month-old Julian Campbell, alone and floating inside the SUV with about 8 inches of air space. Zobrist pulled the unresponsive infant out the window and began CPR on the SUV’s roof. Once the baby spit out water and began breathing, Zobrist, his muscles aching from the cold, called back to his partner to see if firefighters with a boat and wetsuits were coming. But the team was delayed by a train blocking access to the lake, so Zobrist swam back to shore with the baby in one arm. The baby was hospitalized and expected to recover. Zobrist, who has two young sons of his own, was treated for hypothermia in an emergency room but said he was fine. He shied away from any talk about his heroics. “It was just right place, right time,” he said. Cristy Campbell’s body was found hours later in the lake. Preliminary autopsy results determined she died of “environmental exposure and drowning,” Nonn said. The Illinois State Fire Marshal’s office is investigating the cause of the fire. The Campbells had a volatile history but were living together with their children, said Capt. Mike Dixon of the Madison County Sheriff’s Department. Before they married, Justin Campbell was charged with domestic abuse in 2005. He was accused of attacking Cristy Campbell, known then as Cristy Brueggemann, when she was pregnant by slapping her in the head. He was sentenced in March 2006 to probation and fined $500. Despite the violence, they wed on Nov. 3, 2006. She filed for legal separation in September 2010, but the matter was dismissed two months later. In April 2012, Cristy Campbell obtained an emergency protection order against her husband and filed for divorce. She alleged in court papers that he “abuses me on a weekly basis,” including punching and choking her. “He has told me that I’m a no good wife,” Campbell wrote in her application for the protection order. The divorce was granted in February 2013. Glen Carbon police have answered around 50 calls to the Campbell home, including some “domestic-related situations,” Madison County Sheriff John Lakin said. He declined to elaborate. Authorities said the children are with Illinois authorities and will be placed with relatives. ——— Associated Press writer Jim Suhr in Kansas City, Missouri, contributed to this report.

The baby is expected to make a full recovery. A woman found dead in a St. Louis-area lake was identified as the mother of an infant rescued earlier by a paramedic from a submerged SUV shortly after a fatal fire erupted at their home. (The Associated Press ) By Jim SalterThe Associated Press Fri., March 17, 2017 ST. LOUIS—A woman found dead in a St. Louis-area lake was identified Friday as the mother of an infant rescued hours earlier by a paramedic, who performed CPR on the roof of the submerged SUV in which the child was found shortly after a fatal fire erupted at their home. The coroner in nearby Madison County, Ill., released the information as investigators tried to untangle the events that preceded the death of the woman, 32-year-old Cristy Lynn Campbell. Six of her children escaped the fire Thursday morning at her house in Glen Carbon, Illinois, but a man in the house was killed. An autopsy will be conducted Friday to identify the man. Campbell’s ex-husband, 37-year-old Justin Campbell, lived at the home and remains unaccounted for. Court records show they had a volatile relationship, with several reports of domestic violence. About 15 minutes after the fire was reported, a passing motorist spotted an SUV driving down a hill and into Silver Lake in Highland, Illinois, about nine kilometres from the fire scene.

The child, initially unresponsive, is expected to recover and could be released Friday from a Missouri hospital, according to Madison County Sheriff John Lakin. “He definitely saved the child’s life,” Highland Emergency Medical Services chief Brian Wilson said. After finding the baby, authorities began searching the water. Cristy Campbell’s body was pulled from the lake Thursday around 11:15 a.m., about six hours after the SUV plunged into the lake. Before they married, Justin Campbell was charged with domestic abuse in 2005. He was accused of attacking Cristy Campbell, known then as Cristy Brueggemann, when she was pregnant by slapping her in the head. He was sentenced in March 2006 to probation and fined $500 (U.S.).

ASSOCIATED PRESS A body is recovered near Silver Lake in Highland, Ill., on Thursday, after a car with an infant was pulled from the lake earlier in the morning. ASSOCIATED PRESS Firefighters and other emergency workers at the scene near Silver Lake, where a submerged SUV was found with a baby inside in Highland, Ill., on Thursday. ASSOCIATED PRESS Share Tweet Share Email Comments Print ST. LOUIS — A fast-acting paramedic dove into the frigid water of an Illinois lake where a SUV was submerged and found an infant floating inside, then administered CPR on the hood and swam the child to shore, authorities said. The baby is expected to make a full recovery. The infant was one of seven siblings who survived a tragic chain of events that left one person dead in a house fire and second body recovered from the lake where the baby was found. It all began at 5:15 a.m. Thursday in Glen Carbon, Illinois, when fire broke out at a home owned by Cristy Lynn Campbell. An adult died in the fire but six children, siblings ranging up to age 14, escaped. Glen Carbon is about 30 miles east of St. Louis. Sheriff John Lakin said the person killed has not been identified, but Campbell’s estranged husband and the father of the children, Justin Campbell, has not been accounted for. Some of the children ran to a nearby Wal-Mart, others to a home in the neighborhood. The kids at the Wal-Mart asked an arriving worker to call 911, Lakin said. Cristy Campbell was not in the home when firefighters arrived, nor was the couple’s seventh child, a 3-month-old boy. At 5:31 a.m., a motorist passing near Silver Lake in Highland, Illinois, about 16 miles from the home, saw a car heading down a hill toward the water and called 911, Lakin said. Highland paramedic Todd Zobrist arrived quickly, jumped into the 46-degree water and swam 50 to 75 feet to the SUV, where he found a baby floating inside the car. He pulled the baby by the arm to the hood of the SUV, where he began CPR, then swam with the child to shore. The child, initially unresponsive, is expected to recover and could be released today from a hospital in St. Charles, Missouri, Lakin said. “Today was a tragic day all the way around because of both scenes,” Lakin said Thursday. “Fortunately, there is something good that can come of this.” Highland Emergency Medical Services chief Brian Wilson said Zobrist’s actions were heroic. “He definitely saved the child’s life,” Wilson said. After finding the baby, authorities began searching the water. A body was pulled from the lake around 11:15 a.m. While the body has not been identified, Lakin said police are no longer searching for Cristy Campbell. Court records showed that Cristy Campbell and Justin Campbell, 37, had a volatile relationship. In 2005, before they were married, Justin Campbell was charged with domestic abuse for allegedly attacking Cristy Campbell, then known as Cristy Brueggemann, by slapping her in the head when she was pregnant. He was sentenced in March 2006 to probation and fined $500. Despite the violence, they wed on Nov. 3, 2006. She filed for legal separation in September 2010, but the matter was dismissed two months later. In April 2012, Cristy Campbell obtained an emergency protection order against her husband and filed for divorce, alleging in court papers that he “abuses me on a weekly basis,” including punching and choking her. “He has told me that I’m a no good wife,” Campbell wrote in her application for the protection order. The divorce was granted in February 2013. Lakin said Glen Carbon police have answered several calls to Campbell’s home, including some “domestic-related situations,” but he declined to elaborate. “The Glen Carbon Police Department was aware of that house,” Lakin said. Authorities said the children are with Illinois authorities and will be placed with relatives.

Zobrist, who has two young sons of his own, was treated for hypothermia in an emergency room but said he was fine. He shied away from any talk about his heroics. “It was just right place, right time,” he said. Cristy Campbell’s body was found hours later in the lake. Preliminary autopsy results determined she died of “environmental exposure and drowning,” Nonn said. The Illinois State Fire Marshal’s office is investigating the cause of the fire. The Campbells had a volatile history but were living together with their children, said Capt. Mike Dixon of the Madison County Sheriff’s Department. Before they married, Justin Campbell was charged with domestic abuse in 2005. He was accused of attacking Cristy Campbell, known then as Cristy Brueggemann, when she was pregnant by slapping her in the head. He was sentenced in March 2006 to probation and fined $500. Despite the violence, they wed on Nov. 3, 2006. She filed for legal separation in September 2010, but the matter was dismissed two months later. In April 2012, Cristy Campbell obtained an emergency protection order against her husband and filed for divorce. She alleged in court papers that he “abuses me on a weekly basis,” including punching and choking her. “He has told me that I’m a no good wife,” Campbell wrote in her application for the protection order. The divorce was granted in February 2013. Glen Carbon police have answered around 50 calls to the Campbell home, including some “domestic-related situations,” Madison County Sheriff John Lakin said. He declined to elaborate. Authorities said the children are with Illinois authorities and will be placed with relatives. ___ Associated Press writer Jim Suhr in Kansas City, Missouri, contributed to this report.

By Stefanie O'Connell | March 17, 2017 For many, a six-figure salary is the endgame, the true sign that you've made it in life. But, among those who top lists like the Forbes 100, a six- or even seven-figure salary is pocket change, just another step toward true riches. If you're raring to dial up your earnings and be among the world's richest, you'll need to emulate the habits and accomplishments of the wealthy. Here's how you can get started. Kostenko Maxim / Shutterstock.com Start and Commit to Your Business The world's elite tend to have one thing in common: They own or have founded successful businesses. On Forbes' list of the richest billionaires in the world, you'll find great entrepreneurs like Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg. Notably, each have taken risks to build wealth and grow their enterprises. Take Bezos as an example. Amazon's chief grew his net worth by $20 billion over a 14-month period ending December 2016. Those gains, however, were hard-earned, with the company investing in projects without a promise of return (here's to looking at you Fire phone). But, you'll also need to consider that it doesn't pay to just take risks. One of Bezos' core business-building philosophies is to grow slowly. It took a decade before Amazon turned a full-year profit. Now, its growth shows no signs of slowing. As for Zuckerberg, the man behind Facebook, success in business lies in focus. In a 2015 Facebook Q&A, he said, "I feel like I'm not doing my job if I spend any of my energy on things that are silly or frivolous about my life so that I can dedicate all my energy into building the best products and services." Ollyy / Shutterstock.com Make Smart Investments The third highest-ranking billionaire on Forbes is Warren Buffett. By March 2017, he was worth an estimated $60.8 billion. Although some of his multibillion-dollar fortune comes from his company, Berkshire Hathaway, Buffett also enjoys gains from his investments. And if there's one thing Buffett is known for, it's his sage advice on investing. Most notably, he preaches the importance in finding and investing in companies you can trust for the long haul. "If you aren't willing to own a stock for 10 years, don't even think about owning it for 10 minutes," Buffett wrote in his 1996 Berkshire Hathaway chairman's letter. Of course, don't forget about diversifying your assets either, touts life and business strategist Tony Robbins. In addition to traditional investments, Buffett also recommends investing in yourself. "Anything you do to improve your talents and make yourself more valuable will get paid off in terms of appropriate real purchasing power," he said in an interview with CNBC. Unlike other investments, the value you get from investing in yourself can't be stolen or taxed away. Stock-Asso / Shutterstock.com Invent a Solution Many self-made billionaires have made their fortunes by inventing products to fill a specific need or want. Michele Ferrero, for example, took his father's sweets company to the next level by helping people satisfy their sweet tooth with Nutella. The tasty spread was born at a time when cocoa was rationed but hazelnuts were plentiful — offering a creative and practical solution for sweet makers. Sometimes, the best inventions are not original but instead innovations or improvements on existing products. A prime example of innovation comes from billionaire businessman Sam Walton, who opened the first Walmart in 1962. What made Walmart an innovation was the idea that the business could expand enough to sell products to consumers at lower prices than other retailers, saving them money on basic necessities. This basic premise transformed the way America shopped, while making Walmart one of the biggest retailers in the world — and Walton one of the richest men. Related: 10 Most Legendary Ways People Struck It Rich mavo / Shutterstock.com Pursue Your Passion Passion is a popular topic of discussion among self-made billionaires. In fact, one of the common denominators of interviews with billionaires in Robert Jordan's book, "How They Did It: Billion Dollar Insights From the Heart of America," revealed that whereas skills can be learned, passion cannot. It makes sense too, turning your hobby into a business. If you don't enjoy what you do, you might struggle to sell your product — or downright convince others of the value of your work. But although leaping headfirst into a business venture might be romanticized by those who succeeded from the get go, it doesn't hurt to take your time. Start a side business while you work full time, and scale up until you're confident you can make the leap. Milan Zokic / Shutterstock.com Take Action Sometimes, it pays to be proactive. Sara Blakely, founder of Spanx, started her billion-dollar business with just $5,000. Her business venture started when she couldn't find something to wear under her pants. So, she cut the feet off a pair of stockings and — having her own eureka moment — put her savings into designing and marketing a product. The lesson: Take action. You don't need to wait for funding to move forward with your idea if there's a need for it, and you believe in it. "It won't be easy. Your ideas won't work all the time," said Farnoosh Torabi, finance expert and host of the So Money podcast. "People won't always have your best interest at heart. You will trust the wrong people. But nobody makes a million — let alone a billion — dollars because they gave up, gave in or listened to haters." Read: Key Signs You're Ready to Start Your Own Business Monkey Business Images / Shutterstock.com Collaborate Some of the newest and youngest members of the billionaire club are business partners. Snapchat founders Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy, and Airbnb founders Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia, are two examples of the best dynamic duos. A good co-founder complements your skill set and vision. So, if you have a good idea and strong marketing skills but no way to develop your product, you might want to start networking to find someone you click with. It also helps to get friendly with distributors and other people you'll work with on your way to success. Establishing strong relationships can help you learn the ins and outs of what it takes to take a business from idea to execution. Ollyy / Shutterstock.com Adopt a Billionaire Mentality Rich people have a rich mentality, according to Steve Siebold, author of "How Rich People Think." He has interviewed over 1,200 of the world's wealthiest people to uncover the secrets to becoming rich. "While the masses believe becoming wealthy is out of their control, rich people know that making money is really an inside job. It's a cause and effect relationship," he wrote on Business Insider. "Anyone can become wealthy. It has nothing to do with your education or where you come from. It's not what you do that guarantees wealth, it's what you are." So, focus on making things and crafting solutions. Create new products, improve current products and help people. But most importantly, be resilient and keep pushing forward. "The one thing the most successful people I've worked with have in common is true and utter resilience," said entrepreneur and best-selling author of "Shark Tank Jump Start Your Business," Michael Parrish DuDell. "They are not only good at picking themselves up, but they recognize that in the moments they get thrown off the horse or they stumble, those are actually the most important moments, the moments that end up dictating the next move that they make." To grow your own worth into the realm of billions, combine savvy business sense with a passion for excellence, execution and superhuman resilience.

Nine of us had come to the city to photograph the festivities of Mardi Gras week, and now it was time for us to part ways. They were heading home and I was ready to drive back to Seattle to return the RV, a 4,000-kilometer drive with 5 days to be there. I needed to drive 800 kilometers a day to make it on time. I didn't go far that day as I was tired and hadn't slept much the days before. But by Thursday I had made it to Wichita Falls, Texas, and on Friday I was in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Having heard that Albuquerque wasn't exactly the safest city, I decided against sleeping in a Walmart parking lot as I usually do and opted for a motel instead. I woke up around 6:30 the next day. I checked on the RV from my room window, and then gathered my stuff and went down to the lobby to have some breakfast before heading towards Lebanon, Colorado for a short visit, the last destination on my route. At most one hour could have passed between waking up and leaving the motel, but much had happened during that short period of time. I walked around the parking lot and couldn't find my RV. I must have circled that lot 5 times. "You must have been looking in the wrong place", I was telling myself, before it finally hit me that the RV was stolen. I went numb and could no longer hear or feel anything around me. I walked back to the front desk, panic stricken, and told the manager what had happened. There were no security cameras around the motel. She called the cops immediately. Within 10 minutes a patrol car had arrived. Officers Fitzpatrick and Mares asked me to describe the car, took my statement, gave me a case number, and told me they'd call if they get any news. Their tone of voice wasn't optimistic and it wasn't long before I found out why. The other woman working the front desk told me that her car had also been stolen from in front of her house the month before. "Car thefts are very common in Albuquerque", she said.  After finding out I drove a motorhome, she shook her head and said "It's probably already on its way to Mexico". The border was four and half hours away.   Getting paranoïd I went back to my room after booking it for another night and just lay in bed, motionless. I started listing the losses in my mind. At least I had my computer bag and hard drive on me, I figured. If it weren't for that, I'm not sure I would have remained sane. Still, all my clothes, cameras, books, photo prints given to me by photographers met along the way, as well as souvenirs collected from the different Lebanons were in the RV, and that was a huge loss to me. As for the car, it was a rental. I spoke to the owner and luckily he wasn't as upset as I figured he'd be. He was insured, but I wasn't. I spent most of the day in bed and, even when I got hungry and wanted to go out to eat, I started getting paranoid about walking the streets. My computer files were all I had left. Do I leave them in the room? What if someone steals them? Do I take my bag with me? What if someone tries to mug me? I wasn't very rational that day. But I did take a lot of comfort in all the messages I received from friends on facebook offering their support; it really made the ordeal lighter and I felt less alone. Around 10:30 at night that same day, my telephone rang. It was the owner and he informed me that the RV was found. The cops had called him and informed him that it was now in an impound lot, but no further details were given. It's not exactly the kind of information one could easily fall asleep after. But I couldn't wait for the next day to come so I could get more information.         Breaking Bad On Sunday morning at 8:00, I received a call from officer Fitzpatrick. He did confirm that the RV was found, and then he asked me to list all the bags I remember having in the RV before it was stolen. He then gave me an address and asked that I go there as soon as possible; they were waiting for me. I expected the address to be a police station. But when I arrived I found that it was a gated residential community. I walked into the parking lot and saw that a police car was blocking a pick-up truck. Officer Mares came to greet me. "Where is my RV" I asked. I was thinking that's what I came to see." It's more complicated", the officer told me.  He asked me to look at the bed of the pickup truck and there they were, my camera bags, my coat, my jeans, and one of my suitcases. After listing some of my belongings over the phone, the officer knew that what was in the truck was mine. But he cautioned me that I wasn't allowed to touch or move anything. I was confused; these bags were mine, so why couldn't I take them. His explanation was straight out of an episode of "Breaking Bad", which was coincidentally also set in Albuquerque. Early in the afternoon the day before, a few residents from the community had seen the pickup truck circling the street around them for some time and then park inside, and they reported the suspicious activity to the police. When the cops came, they found the RV next to the truck. Since it fit the description I had given to them – the license plates had been removed – they knocked on the back door and were greeted with a woman high on drugs. As it happened, two women had stolen the RV from the motel's parking lot, had also stolen that pickup truck, and drove both of them to the gated community. They took out anything they believed to be valuable from the RV and dumped it in the truck bed. My RV was then on its way to being transformed into a meth lab. When the cops found it, it couldn't be turned on, so they had to call a towing company to take it to the impound lot. All of these events happened in less than 12 hours. And since the pickup truck was stolen property and the owner couldn't be contacted, the police needed a search warrant before releasing my belongings to me. As my friend Tyler Simpson who was with me in New Orleans would joke, this "Breaking Fad".     Warrant-signing iPad A few minutes later, a detective joined the two officers at the scene. Detective Ronald Clipp assured me that I would have no problem getting back what I owned as soon as possible. He had left a message for the judge so he could sign the search warrant. Because it was a Sunday, the detective was hoping for the judge to have his warrant-signing iPad on him, a technological advance I wasn't aware of whereby the warrant didn't need to be a physical piece of paper. Unfortunately, the judge didn't have his iPad and I would have to wait until Monday. I left the scene relieved that not all had been lost. But I still wanted to see what condition the RV was in. So I requested an Uber and went on my way. As I was recounting my story to the Uber driver, he was apologetic about the city being in the state it's in, but then said: "I love Albuquerque though. I've only been mugged once since I've moved here." Stockholm Syndrome at its finest. The impound lot did not allow any photography on site, and the manager, a nasty man in his fifties, told me I had 5 minutes to check the RV and empty my stuff if I ever find any. As he walked me past the gate into the lot, I was met by a wide field filled with RVs, all stolen. I immediately identified mine and it didn't look bad from a distance. As I drew nearer I found that the front tires were flat; still a minor issue. But when I walked into the car, it was one horrible shock. Everything was upside down. The dashboard was removed and loose wires were dangling from it. The cabinets were emptied and debris was all over the floor. One of My suitcases was half-filled and lay open on the couch, as if someone was interrupted while filling it up. I gathered all of what I could find into two suitcases and hurried out. It was painful to watch what had become of my temporary home. I had been living in it for only 5 months but still, I had grown attached to it and it was hard accepting that I had to leave it behind in such a condition. But I had no other choice.   A kit to shoot up heroin The next morning, Monday, March 6th, I received a phone call from Detective Clipp. He was able to secure the warrant, with the pickup truck having been covered the night before, sealed, and towed to the same lot where the RV was. I met him as fast as I could and we were both joined by CSI Megan Maestas so she could photograph the evidence while the crime scene was being investigated; no one had yet taken a look at the contents of the truck since the arrest. Detective Clipp was able to confirm that one woman was directly arrested over the theft, an Ashley Leah G., but he couldn't disclose how the other woman, supposedly her mother, was implicated. There was also the possibility that a third male suspect was involved. As the detective and the CSI went over every inch of the truck, much was discovered about the unfortunate life of Ashley. I was extremely relieved to recover all my cameras and most of my books. One carry-on bag that had the photo prints and the souvenirs collected from the Lebanons was never recovered. A relatively minor loss given the circumstances. Still, I was honestly more enamored by Ashley's life than by what I lost. On the passenger side, we found a large purse. In it were her driver license, photos with her son, and my notebook. The pages I had written on were torn off and she had inventoried every piece of equipment I had, including their serial number, and was trying to get quotes to sell them. She was arrested before she was able to sell anything. There was also a leather binder I had which held paper documents. These documents, relatively unimportant, were missing, but the binder pouches were filled with needles, tourniquets, and q-tips, the kit to shoot up heroin. A small package containing heroin was found there as well. Ashley was extremely organized. The needles were perfectly lined up next to each other, the inventory of my equipment so methodically written, and strangely, after opening the suitcase that was half-filled in the RV, I found that she had folded each of my t-shirts and underwear into neat squares and lined them up in a row next to each other. She was obviously not a messy person and I kept picturing scenarios about how she could succeed in a corporate job if only she didn't choose a life of crime. Her records showed that this wasn't her first offense. The last discovery we found in the binder was a journal she had written on March 1st and included with the heroin shooting kit. It turned out that Ashley used to live in a Winnebago, a motorhome like mine, but that she was going to lose it, for unwritten reasons, in 4 days. She had stolen my RV on the same day she lost hers. Despite the awful past days I went through after discovering the theft, I can honestly say that I bear the woman no ill will. Perhaps it's the thought that she lost her home, that she has a young son, and that she might not have been dealt the best hand in life. Hopefully she'll find her way and be rehabilitated in jail. Now that I had recovered most of what I was had, it was time to leave this city. The RV's owner had found a local repair shop and was handling the matter with them over the phone. There was no need for me to stick around. So I rented a compact car, stacked it with my suitcases, and drove off towards San Francisco where I'd be spending a week with my aunt and cousins before returning to Beirut. Hopefully all the excitement was now behind me, at least for the near future.    (This article is part of Fadi Boukaram's road trip on the path of cities called Lebanon in the USA.

LOUIS A man found dead inside a burned home in southern Illinois had been shot in the head, and a gun was found in his ex-wife's SUV after she drove into a nearby lake and died shortly after the fire was reported, authorities said Friday. The pair's infant son was pulled from the submerged SUV by a paramedic who swam through frigid water, quickly realized a baby and not a doll was floating inside, and performed CPR on the boy atop the vehicle's roof. Six other children safely escaped the Thursday fire at the house, where the divorced parents — who had a history of domestic violence — both lived. Preliminary autopsy results released Friday show 37-year-old Justin Campbell died from the gunshot wound. But testing can't be done to determine whether the gun found in Cristy Campbell's SUV was used to shoot Campbell because the bullet that struck him hasn't been found, according to Madison County Coroner Steve Nonn. Nonn later told The Associated Press that nothing in the investigation or autopsy suggests the gunshot wound was self-inflected. Police said the tangled chain of events began when some of the children ran to a Wal-Mart store near their home around 5:15 a.m. Thursday in Glen Carbon, Illinois. They told an arriving worker to call 911 because their house was on fire. Responding firefighters found Justin Campbell's body. About 16 minutes later, a motorist called 911 after seeing an SUV travel down a hill and into Silver Lake in Highland, about 16 miles away from the house. Paramedics Todd Zobrist and Ty Barr arrived minutes later. Zobrist said he could see headlights in the water and knew there might be someone inside the SUV, which was submerged in about 5 feet of water. He stripped off his shirt, socks and boots, and swam 75 feet to the vehicle. "When I got halfway there I was thoroughly thinking to myself, 'This is a terrible decision and I really need to just turn around and go back to the dock because I'm going to get myself in a lot of trouble,'" Zobrist said at a news conference Friday. "At that point, though, I was committed, I was already wet, I was already cold." Dark outside and difficult to see, he found the only access inside the vehicle was through an open driver's side window. Zobrist peered into the back seat — and saw something. "It looked like two feet and two hands," he said. "And at first I thought it was just a doll, a kid's toy of some sort." It was 3-month-old Julian Campbell, alone and floating inside the SUV with about 8 inches of air space. Zobrist pulled the unresponsive infant out the window and began CPR on the SUV's roof. Once the baby spit out water and began breathing, Zobrist, his muscles aching from the cold, called back to his partner to see if firefighters with a boat and wetsuits were coming. But the team was delayed by a train blocking access to the lake, so Zobrist swam back to shore with the baby in one arm. The baby was hospitalized and expected to recover. Zobrist, who has two young sons of his own, was treated for hypothermia in an emergency room but said he was fine. He shied away from any talk about his heroics. "It was just right place, right time," he said. Cristy Campbell's body was found hours later in the lake. Preliminary autopsy results determined she died of "environmental exposure and drowning," Nonn said. The Illinois State Fire Marshal's office is investigating the cause of the fire. The Campbells had a volatile history but were living together with their children, said Capt. Mike Dixon of the Madison County Sheriff's Department. Before they married, Justin Campbell was charged with domestic abuse in 2005. He was accused of attacking Cristy Campbell, known then as Cristy Brueggemann, when she was pregnant by slapping her in the head. He was sentenced in March 2006 to probation and fined $500. Despite the violence, they wed on Nov. 3, 2006. She filed for legal separation in September 2010, but the matter was dismissed two months later. In April 2012, Cristy Campbell obtained an emergency protection order against her husband and filed for divorce. She alleged in court papers that he "abuses me on a weekly basis," including punching and choking her. "He has told me that I'm a no good wife," Campbell wrote in her application for the protection order. The divorce was granted in February 2013. Glen Carbon police have answered around 50 calls to the Campbell home, including some "domestic-related situations," Madison County Sheriff John Lakin said. He declined to elaborate. Authorities said the children are with Illinois authorities and will be placed with relatives.

LOUIS — A fast-acting paramedic dove into the frigid water of an Illinois lake where a SUV was submerged on Thursday and found an infant floating inside, then administered CPR on the hood and swam the child to shore, authorities said. The baby is expected to make a full recovery. The infant was one of seven siblings who survived a tragic chain of events that left one person dead in a house fire and second body recovered from the lake where the baby was found. It all began at 5:15 a.m. in Glen Carbon, Illinois, when fire broke out at a home owned by Cristy Lynn Campbell. An adult died in the fire but six children, siblings ranging up to age 14, escaped. Glen Carbon is about 30 miles east of St. Louis. Sheriff John Lakin said the person killed has not been identified, but Campbell’s estranged husband and the father of the children, Justin Campbell, has not been accounted for. Some of the children ran to a nearby Walmart, others to a home in the neighbourhood. The kids at the Walmart asked an arriving worker to call 911, Lakin said. Cristy Campbell was not in the home when firefighters arrived nor was the couple’s seventh child, a 3-month-old boy. At 5:31 a.m., a motorist passing near Silver Lake in Highland, Illinois, about 16 miles from the home, saw a car heading down a hill toward the water and called 911, Lakin said. Highland paramedic Todd Zobrist arrived quickly, jumped into the 46-degree water and swam 50 to 75 feet to the SUV, where he found a baby floating inside the car. He pulled the baby by the arm to the hood of the SUV, where he began CPR, then swam with the child to shore. The child, initially unresponsive, is expected to recover and could be released Friday from a hospital in St. Charles, Missouri, Lakin said. “Today was a tragic day all the way around because of both scenes,” Lakin said. “Fortunately, there is something good that can come of this.” Highland Emergency Medical Services chief Brian Wilson said Zobrist’s actions were heroic. “He definitely saved the child’s life,” Wilson said. After finding the baby, authorities began searching the water. A body was pulled from the lake around 11:15 a.m. While the body has not been identified, Lakin said police are no longer searching for Cristy Campbell. Court records showed that Cristy Campbell and Justin Campbell, 37, had a volatile relationship. In 2005, before they were married, Justin Campbell was charged with domestic abuse for allegedly attacking Cristy Campbell, then known as Cristy Brueggemann, by slapping her in the head when she was pregnant.

RBR Meat Company Inc. recalled its Marketside supreme frozen pizza, which may have been “adulterated with Listeria monocytogenes,” according to FSIS. The pizzas were sold at select Walmart stores in a 50.6-oz. box containing single shrink-wrapped 16-inch pizzas labeled as “Marketside Extra Large Supreme Pizza,” with lot code 20547. The pizzas were shipped to Walmart distribution centers in California, Nevada, Utah and Washington. During routine sampling, FSIS discovered the Listeria monocytogenes bacteria. “There are no confirmed reports of adverse reactions from consumption of the pizzas at this time,” according to the recall announcement. This recall is a Class I recall, which means it is “a health hazard situation where there is a reasonable probability that the use of the product will cause serious, adverse health consequences or death,” according to the USDA. FSIS urges consumers who have bought the product to not eat it. They advise throwing away the pizzas or returning them to the place of purchase. Listeriosis is a serious infection usually caused by eating contaminated food and can be particularly dangerous for pregnant women and older people. Symptoms include fever, muscle aches and sometimes diarrhea or other gastrointestinal problems, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About 1,600 cases are reported in the United States every year, with 260 resulting in death, according to the CDC. Last week federal health officials announced an unrelated recall of soft raw milk cheese made by Vulto Creamery due to a listeria outbreak responsible for six cases of illness including two deaths. Last month Sargento Foods announced its own recall of several cheeses due to potential listeria contamination, which prompted the company to cut ties with one of its suppliers.

(Laurie Skrivan/St. Louis Post-Dispatch via AP) ST. LOUIS (AP) — A fast-acting paramedic dove into the frigid water of an Illinois lake where a SUV was submerged on Thursday and found an infant floating inside, then administered CPR on the hood and swam the child to shore, authorities said. The baby is expected to make a full recovery. The infant was one of seven siblings who survived a tragic chain of events that left one person dead in a house fire and second body recovered from the lake where the baby was found. It all began at 5:15 a.m. in Glen Carbon, Illinois, when fire broke out at a home owned by Cristy Lynn Campbell. An adult died in the fire but six children, siblings ranging up to age 14, escaped. Glen Carbon is about 30 miles east of St. Louis. Sheriff John Lakin said the person killed has not been identified, but Campbell’s estranged husband and the father of the children, Justin Campbell, has not been accounted for. Some of the children ran to a nearby Wal-Mart, others to a home in the neighborhood. The kids at the Wal-Mart asked an arriving worker to call 911, Lakin said. Cristy Campbell was not in the home when firefighters arrived nor was the couple’s seventh child, a 3-month-old boy. At 5:31 a.m., a motorist passing near Silver Lake in Highland, Illinois, about 16 miles from the home, saw a car heading down a hill toward the water and called 911, Lakin said. Highland paramedic Todd Zobrist arrived quickly, jumped into the 46-degree water and swam 50 to 75 feet to the SUV, where he found a baby floating inside the car. He pulled the baby by the arm to the hood of the SUV, where he began CPR, then swam with the child to shore. The child, initially unresponsive, is expected to recover and could be released Friday from a hospital in St. Charles, Missouri, Lakin said. “Today was a tragic day all the way around because of both scenes,” Lakin said. “Fortunately, there is something good that can come of this.” Highland Emergency Medical Services chief Brian Wilson said Zobrist’s actions were heroic. “He definitely saved the child’s life,” Wilson said. After finding the baby, authorities began searching the water. A body was pulled from the lake around 11:15 a.m. While the body has not been identified, Lakin said police are no longer searching for Cristy Campbell. Court records showed that Cristy Campbell and Justin Campbell, 37, had a volatile relationship. In 2005, before they were married, Justin Campbell was charged with domestic abuse for allegedly attacking Cristy Campbell, then known as Cristy Brueggemann, by slapping her in the head when she was pregnant. He was sentenced in March 2006 to probation and fined $500. Despite the violence they wed on Nov. 3, 2006. She filed for legal separation in September 2010, but the matter was dismissed two months later. In April 2012, Cristy Campbell obtained an emergency protection order against her husband and filed for divorce, alleging in court papers that he “abuses me on a weekly basis,” including punching and choking her. “He has told me that I’m a no good wife,” Campbell wrote in her application for the protection order. The divorce was granted in February 2013. Lakin said Glen Carbon police have answered several calls to Campbell’s home, including some “domestic-related situations,” but he declined to elaborate. “The Glen Carbon Police Department was aware of that house,” Lakin said. Authorities said the children are with Illinois authorities and will be placed with relatives.

(Westfield Police Department) Print Email Lucas Ropek | lropek@repub.com By Lucas Ropek | lropek@repub.com The Republican on March 16, 2017 at 8:58 PM comments WESTFIELD - The Westfield Detective Bureau has admitted to using a picture of an "innocent shopper" in a social media press release regarding a criminal suspect.  On Wednesday, Westfield detectives announced that the man pictured above was suspected of using a stolen credit card to buy an electrical snow blower at a local Walmart. However, the pictured used Wednesday is apparently of the wrong man, according to police.  "We would like to apologize to the male party depicted in the pictures from the Walmart stolen credit card incident and our followers," reads a statement from the Bureau's Facebook page. "There was a mix-up in the information we received about the transaction from Walmart and the pictures of the male party we posted as the suspect, was actually an innocent shopper," the statement continues.  According to the new press release regarding the incident, Westfield detectives say the stolen credit card had the same last four numbers as the man captured in the published surveillance images. Police also said that the man who was used in the press release bought the same item at roughly the same time on the same day as the suspect who used the stolen credit card. "We are working on getting the correct information," the statement concludes.  MASSLIVE ON SOCIAL MEDIA MassLive News on Facebook MassLive News on Twitter MassLive on YouTube Breaking News newsletter When the big stories break, we'll send you an alert.

Beth DeLaurentis says she went back to the store on George Washington Memorial Highway twice and called three times, but never had any luck. "I just totally gave up hope," she says. For that reason, when she got a letter that she had a package waiting for her at the post office, she says she didn't think anything of it. The package, with a return address to only "Parsons, Yorktown, VA" had a note on the back saying, "This was found in a cart @ Walmart :)" Inside the "priority mail" package, she found her wallet inside, untouched. "I was ecstatic I was so happy, then I came to terms with it, that there's really good people out there," says DeLaurentis. "You've just got to find them." So that's what she did. DeLaurentis posted about what happened on Facebook in the hopes that it could connect her with the Good Samaritan. The post got 1,100 likes and was shared hundreds of times. Laura Parsons spotted it while scrolling through Facebook on Wednesday. "I didn't want anyone to really know it was me because I was just making sure she got her wallet," she says, while laughing, calling the situation embarrassing. Parsons says she didn't even realize the wallet was in her cart until after she checked out and loaded her bags into the car. "I took it back in to take it to customer service, but the line was really long in customer service, so I just thought, it's probably just easier for me to do the right thing rather than turn it over to someone else to do the right thing." Parsons responded to DeLaurentis' post, saying: "You are welcome!

Documents filed with securities regulators say the daughter of defeated U.S. presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has joined its 14-member board. The company is controlled by Barry Diller. Chelsea Clinton is also a director of another company that Diller controls, IAC/InterActiveCorp. Expedia did not disclose how much she would be paid, but non-employee directors each earned more than $250,000 in 2015, according to the most recent regulatory filings. Filings for IAC say Chelsea Clinton is entitled to receive $300,000 in a mix of stock and cash each year for serving as a director. The Expedia filing on Friday came a day after publishers Penguin Young Readers announced it will publish a children's book by Chelsea Clinton on May 30. The book is called "She Persisted." In the book, Clinton will honor 13 American women "who never take no for an answer," including Harriet Tubman, Sonia Sotomayor and Oprah Winfrey. U.S. temporarily bans larger electronics from cabins of certain flights Published: Tuesday, March 21, 2017 @ 3:07 AM By: Patrick McMahon, Rare.us Woman typing on laptop computer in commercial airplane (Jason Dewey / The Image Bank / Getty Images)(Jason Dewey/Getty Images) Jason Dewey/Getty Images A temporary ban on carry-on electronics is set to take effect Tuesday on certain flights into the U.S., according to reporting from The Hill and supported by tweets posted by Royal Jordanian Airlines. Those tweets have since been deleted but read, “Following instructions from the concerned U.S. departments, we kindly inform our dearest passengers departing to and arriving from the United States that carrying any electronic or electrical device on board the flight cabins is strictly prohibited,” according to The Hill. >> Read more trending news The ban will be formally announced Tuesday but is said to affect 13 countries for the next 96 hours and is a response to a specific intelligence threat, The Hill reported, citing Fox News. The ban reportedly has nothing to do with President Donald Trump’s travel ban, two versions of which have now been struck down by courts across the country. Affected countries, airlines and flights are in the process of being informed, CNN reported. The ban reportedly applies to all electronics except mobile phones and medical devices; items such as laptops, tablets and cameras may not be brought into the cabin but can fly in checked luggage. White House promotes satirical article praising Trump's new budget Published: Sunday, March 19, 2017 @ 2:34 AM By: Elizabeth Vale, Rare.us Talk about "fake news.”  The White House reportedly shared a story Friday that was written as satire.  This was in today's email from the White House.

In that story, “How the White House made me Real News,” she came to the conclusion that either White House officials “read it and loved it, especially the part where I wrote that all schoolchildren will be taught by an F-35 in a Make America Great Again hat, or they … did not read it but liked the headline.” The White House has yet to comment on the presumed mistake.

 Six charts that illustrate the divide between rural and urban America Brian Thiede, Lillie Greiman, Stephan Weiler, Steven C. Beda, and Tessa Conroy, The Conversation Mar. 17, 2017, 8:08 PM 413 facebook linkedin twitter email print Editor’s note: We’ve all heard of the great divide between life in rural and urban America. But what are the factors that contribute to these differences? We asked sociologists, economists, geographers and historians to describe the divide from different angles. The data paint a richer and sometimes surprising picture of the U.S. today. 1. Poverty is higher in rural areas Discussions of poverty in the United States often mistakenly focus on urban areas. While urban poverty is a unique challenge, rates of poverty have historically been higher in rural than urban areas. In fact, levels of rural poverty were often double those in urban areas throughout the 1950s and 1960s. While these rural-urban gaps have diminished markedly, substantial differences persist. In 2015, 16.7 percent of the rural population was poor, compared with 13.0 percent of the urban population overall – and 10.8 percent among those living in suburban areas outside of principal cities. </p> <p> Contrary to common assumptions, substantial shares of the poor are employed. Approximately 45 percent of poor, prime-age (25-54) <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/cps/technical-documentation/subject-definitions.html#householder" rel="nofollow">householders</a> worked at least part of 2015 in rural and urban areas alike. </p> <p> The link between work and poverty was different in the past. In the early 1980s, the share of the rural poor that was employed exceeded that in urban areas by more than 15 percent. Since then, more and more poor people in rural areas are also unemployed – a trend consistent with other patterns documented below. </p> <p> That said, rural workers continue to benefit less from work than their urban counterparts. In 2015, 9.8 percent of rural, prime-age working householders were poor, compared with 6.8 percent of their urban counterparts. Nearly a third of the rural working poor faced extreme levels of deprivation, with family incomes below 50 percent of the poverty line, or approximately US$12,000 for a family of four. </p> <p> Large shares of the rural workforce also live in economically precarious circumstances just above the poverty line. Nearly one in five rural working householders lived in families with incomes less than 150 percent of the poverty line. That’s nearly five percentage points more than among urban workers (13.5 percent). </p> <p> According to <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0743016716300225" rel="nofollow">recent research</a>, rural-urban gaps in working poverty cannot be explained by rural workers’ levels of education, industry of employment or other similar factors that might affect earnings. Rural poverty – at least among workers – cannot be fully explained by the characteristics of the rural population. That means reducing rural poverty will require attention to the structure of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/storyline/wp/2014/08/07/the-places-are-poor-and-the-people-are-poor/?utm_term=.2a95ae1858d2" rel="nofollow">rural economies and communities</a>. </p> <p> – <em>Brian Thiede, Assistant Professor of Rural Sociology and Demography, Pennsylvania State University</em>  </p> <h2> 2. Most new jobs aren’t in rural areas </h2> <p> It’s easy to see why many rural Americans believe the recession never ended: For them, it hasn’t. </p> <p> <iframe width="100%" height="500" frameborder="0" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/YFJz6/3/"/> </p> <p> Rural communities still haven’t recovered the jobs they lost in the recession. Census data show that the rural job market is smaller now – 4.26 percent smaller, to be exact – than it was in 2008. In these data are shuttered coal mines on the edges of rural towns and boarded-up gas stations on rural main streets. In these data are the angers, fears and frustrations of much of rural America. </p> <p> This isn’t a new trend. Mechanization, environmental regulations and increased global competition have been slowly whittling away at resource extraction economies and driving jobs from rural communities for most of the 20th century. But the fact that what they’re experiencing now is simply the cold consequences of history likely brings little comfort to rural people. If anything, it only adds to their fear that what they once had is gone and it’s never coming back. </p> <p> Nor is it likely that the slight increase in rural jobs since 2013 brings much comfort. As the resource extraction economy continues to shrink, most of the new jobs in rural areas are being created in the <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/rural-economy-population/employment-education/rural-employment-and-unemployment/" rel="nofollow">service sector</a>. So Appalachian coal miners and Northwest loggers are now stocking shelves at the local Walmart. </p> <p> The identity of rural communities used to be rooted in work. The signs at the entrances of their towns welcomed visitors to coal country or timber country. Towns named their high school mascots after the work that sustained them, like the Jordan <a href="http://www.jhsalumniassociation.com/why_beetdiggers.php" rel="nofollow">Beetpickers</a> in Utah or the Camas <a href="http://chs.camas.wednet.edu/" rel="nofollow">Papermakers</a> in Washington. It used to be that, when someone first arrived at these towns, they knew what people did and that they were proud to do it. </p> <p> That’s not so clear anymore. How do you communicate your communal identity when the work once at the center of that identity is gone, and calling the local high school football team the “Walmart Greeters” simply doesn’t have the same ring to it? </p> <p> Looking at rural jobs data, is it so hard to understand why many rural people are nostalgic for the past and fearful for the future? </p> <p> – <em>Steven Beda, Instructor of History, University of Oregon</em> </p> <h2> 3. Disabilities are more common in rural areas </h2> <p> Disability matters in rural America. Data from the <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/about.html" rel="nofollow">American Community Survey</a>, an annual government poll, reveal that disability is more prevalent in rural counties than their urban counterparts. </p> <p> The rate of disability increases from 11.8 percent in the most urban metropolitan counties to 15.6 percent in smaller micropolitan areas and 17.7 percent in the most rural, or noncore, counties. </p> <p> <iframe width="100%" height="227" frameborder="0" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/2AKpL/3/"/> </p> <p> While <a href="http://scholarworks.umt.edu/ruralinst_independent_living_community_participation/5/" rel="nofollow">rural-urban differences</a> in disability have been analyzed previously, researchers have had little opportunity to further explore this disparity, as updated data on rural disability were unavailable until <a href="http://rtc.ruralinstitute.umt.edu/research-findings/geography/" rel="nofollow">recently</a>. Fortunately, the census released updated new county-level disability estimates in 2014, ending a 14-year knowledge gap. </p> <p> The release of these estimates has also allowed us to build a picture of geographic variations in disability across the nation. Disability rates vary significantly across the U.S. Although the national trend of higher disability rates in rural counties persists at the regional and even divisional <a href="http://rtc.ruralinstitute.umt.edu/research-findings/geography/disability-region/" rel="nofollow">level</a>, it is clear that disability in rural America is not homogeneous. Rates of rural disability range from around 15 percent in the Great Plains to 21 percent in the central South. </p> <p> <span class="KonaFilter image-container display-table image on-image" data-post-image=""> <img src="http://static6.businessinsider.com/image/58cc4961d349f949008b5233-754" alt="image 20170308 24192 1xrq31w" data-mce-source="American Community Survey (ACS) 2011-2015 5 year estimates, Table S1810, CC BY" data-mce-caption="Data reveal notable differences between rural and urban America" data-link="http://rtc.ruralinstitute.umt.edu/resources/disability-counts-data-finder/"/> <span class="caption-source"> <span class="caption">Data reveal notable differences between rural and urban America</span> <span class="source"> <a href="http://rtc.ruralinstitute.umt.edu/resources/disability-counts-data-finder/">American Community Survey (ACS) 2011-2015 5 year estimates, Table S1810, CC BY</a> </span> </span> </span> </p> <p> A variety of factors may be behind these regional and rural differences, including differences in <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953601000880" rel="nofollow">demographics</a>, <a href="https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ556558" rel="nofollow">economic patterns</a>, health and <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/104420730001000205?legid=spdps%3B10%2F2%2F207&amp;patientinform-links=yes&amp;" rel="nofollow">service access</a> and state disability <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1970314" rel="nofollow">policies</a>. </p> <p> While this survey provides a glimpse into the national prevalence of disability and reveals a persistent rural-urban disparity, it is important to note its limitations. <a href="http://www.who.int/topics/disabilities/en/" rel="nofollow">Disability</a> is the result of an interaction between an individual and his or her environment. Therefore, these data do not directly <a href="https://www.census.gov/people/disability/methodology/acs.html" rel="nofollow">measure disability</a>, as they measure only physical function and do not consider environmental factors such as <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15575330.2015.1108989" rel="nofollow">inaccessible housing</a>. </p> <p> – <em>Lillie Greiman and Andrew Myers, Project Directors at the Rural Institute for Inclusive Communities at the University of Montana; Christiane von Reichert, Professor of Geography, University of Montana</em> </p> <p>   </p> <hr/> <p>   </p> <h2> 4. Rural areas are surprisingly entrepreneurial </h2> <p> The United States’ continuing economic dominance is perhaps most attributable to the very smallest elements of its economy: its entrepreneurial start-ups. <a href="https://www.census.gov/ces/dataproducts/bds/" rel="nofollow">Nearly 700,000 new job-creating businesses</a> open each year. That’s almost 2,000 every day, each helping to create new market niches in the global economy. </p> <p> Most people mistakenly believe these pioneering establishments occur in overwhelmingly in metropolitan areas, such as in the now-mythic start-up culture of Silicon Valley. </p> <p> Yet, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, it is in fact nonmetropolitan counties that have higher rates of self-employed business proprietors than their metropolitan counterparts. </p> <p> <iframe width="100%" height="528" frameborder="0" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/n3sbw/5/"/> </p> <p> Furthermore, the more rural the county, the higher its level of entrepreneurship. Some of these counties have a farming legacy – perhaps the most entrepreneurial of occupations – but farmers represent <a href="https://www.bea.gov/regional/" rel="nofollow">less than one-sixth</a> of business owners in nonmetro areas. Even for nonfarm enterprises, rural entrepreneurship rates are higher. </p> <p> The reality is that rural areas have to be entrepreneurial, as industries with concentrations of wage and salary jobs are necessarily scarce. </p> <p> Start-up businesses have notoriously difficult survival prospects. So it is perhaps even more surprising that relatively isolated nonmetropolitan businesses are on average more resilient than their metro cousins, despite the considerable economic advantages of urban areas, which boast a denser networks of workers, suppliers and markets. The resilience of rural start-ups is perhaps due to more cautious business practices in areas with few alternative employment options. </p> <p> <iframe width="100%" height="500" frameborder="0" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/5bZO2/4/"/> </p> <p> This resilience is also remarkably persistent over time, consistently being at least on par with metro start-ups, and regularly having survival rates up to 10 percentage points higher than in metro areas over 1990-2007. </p> <script type="text/javascript" src="https://theconversation.com/javascripts/lib/content_tracker_hook.js"

By Priya Joshi Updated March 18, 2017 23:24 GMT Fire broke out at a home owned by Cristy Lynn Campbell, 32 in Glen Carbon, Illinois where her estranged husband was found deadKVOV In a tragic sequence of events, an Illinois man was found dead in a burning house with a gunshot to his head. Several hours later, his ex-wife's body was recovered from a nearby lake. Fire broke out at a home owned by Cristy Lynn Campbell, 32 at 5:15 a.m. on Thursday (16 March) in Glen Carbon, Illinois. Six of her seven children, ranging up to age 14, escaped the burning building and fled to a nearby Walmart store where they raised the alarm. Arriving at the scene, fire-fighters found Cristy's estranged husband and the father of the children, Justin Campbell, 37, dead. Christy had apparently fled in an SUV with the couple's seventh child, a 3-month-old boy. The car was seen driving down a hill into Silver Lake in Highland about 15 minutes after the fire was reported. The baby boy, who was floating inside the car was pulled from the sinking vehicle by paramedic Todd Zobrist who put the baby on the SUV's roof and successfully performed CPR, reviving the child before swimming with him back to shore. Several hours later the body of his mother was recovered from the lake. Madison County Coroner's Office determined Friday that Justin Campbell had died of a gunshot wound and not as a result of the fire, reports KMOV. Investigators have not yet determined how he was shot or how the fire started. A gun was found in the SUV Sheriff John Lakin confirmed. According to court records, there were several reports of domestic incidents at the former couples home. In 2012, Ms Campbell obtained an emergency protection order against her husband and filed for divorce, claiming in court papers he "abuses me on a weekly basis". She was granted a divorce the following year. The children are currently in the care of authorities and will be placed with relatives Sky News reports.

I thought for sure we were jinxing ourselves out of a snowstorm when everything started getting shut down on Monday afternoon, but Mother Nature decided to agree with the weather forecasters for once, and we had a glorious snow day. The stars were not aligned for us to have a cozy, relaxing day of rest, however. March Madness isn’t limited to basketball. March is also championship month for swimmers. So, I’ve been on the road with the swim team for the past few weekends, and will be for the rest of the weekends in March. This means that none of the regular household chores have been kept up with, like the cleaning, the grocery shopping, and the laundry. Part of me really wanted a snow day as an excuse to stay home and catch up on some of that, but the other part of me knew that if it was bad enough to stay home from work, the grocery shopping wasn’t going to get done either. That meant being holed up with a bunch of “starving” children who I was going to try to coerce into doing housework. The odds of that turning out well were absolutely nonexistent. So, on my way home from the swim meet on Sunday night, I made a pit stop at the grocery store and tried to stock up on blizzard supplies. I grabbed the makings for a hearty breakfast and a big pot of homemade chicken potpie. I also grabbed the fixings for a plate of nachos, because I was hoping that at some point, we would get to relax and catch up on some family movie time. I also, proactively, I thought, remembered to get lunch supplies for when they eventually did head back to school. About halfway through my grocery shopping trip, I got a text from A. It just so happens that he needed a “non-store bought” superhero costume for school Monday morning. He did tell me about it Friday night, at which time, I informed him that I would be gone all weekend, and he knew where the craft supplies and the dress-up clothes were, and he could have at it. I have to say, this is probably the first time ever that A has waited until the last minute for a project like this. Normally, his brain is bursting with so many ideas, that he can’t wait to get started. But, as our luck would have it, the one time he did wait until the last minute was just about the worst possible timing. So, the text he sent me was the list of supplies that he absolutely needed to finish his costume. At that point, I realized I had two choices: one, I could not buy anything on his list, and then have to deal with a bad attitude from him and more wasted time as he re-evaluated and replanned, or two, I could stop at Walmart and see what I could find. It was already after 9 p.m., so I wasn’t optimistic, but Walmart seemed like the better option. I quickly checked out at the grocery store. In my haste and panic, I also forgot some of the staple items that I haven’t kept up with since I haven’t done a major grocery shopping trip in a few weeks. So, the little bit of time I had on Sunday night to try to catch up with some laundry and household chores was diverted into helping “Grammar Lord” finish his superhero costume. The assignment was to create a superhero to help them defeat the bad guy “PSSAs.” As I was gluing myself together with the hot glue gun, all I could think was that now I understand why everyone hates these things. Monday evening, as I left swim practice, knowing full well that school and work were already canceled, I decided to brave one more run to the grocery store, “just in case.” I texted the Wonderful Husband to ask what we needed. His response was “diet soda and breakfast stuff.” Actually, his response was a lot longer than that, but my phone battery died in the middle of the list, and since I had already gotten the breakfast stuff, I grabbed a few bottles of diet soda and a few baking supplies, as I thought a batch or two of cookies would be a nice treat for the kids when they came in from shoveling. Home I went, blissfully ignorant that the WH had sent an urgent text that we were also almost out of ketchup. The next morning, as the snow piled up, we all sat down to a delicious breakfast of home fries, eggs, bacon, and sausage, topped off with warm blueberry muffins. In a matter of minutes, the kids started circling the remaining half bottle of ketchup like a pack of hyenas. We took the only course of action we could and started everyone on ketchup rations. It was not an auspicious start to the day. I decided that we needed big projects to keep everyone engaged, so I put the kids to work cleaning out the craft/school supply station. There were alternately squeals of joy as long lost projects were happened on and “missing” artifacts were recovered. Then there were squabbles as to who saw what first and of course, someone meandered off to start coloring “because they felt like it.” When at last, the fighting finally got on my nerves, I bundled them up and sent them out to help the WH shovel. We cycled through this for most of the day, and by the time we were on each other’s last nerve, the potpie was ready to eat and we finally settled down to watch “Doctor Strange.” It wasn’t the most memorable snow day ever, but at least it was a productive one.

Facebook Google Investing Analyst Upgrades Bankruptcy Buffett Corporate Governance Corporate Performance Dividends and Buybacks Earnings ETFs and Mutual Funds International Markets IPOs and Secondaries Mergers and Acquisitions Personal Finance Rumors Value Investing Economy Energy Government Regulation Healthcare Housing Jobs Special Report Brands and Products Cities Countries States Another Huge Walton Family Trade Highlights Insider Selling: Wal-Mart, Kodak, Analog Devices, Del Taco Restaurants and More By Lee Jackson March 18, 2017 10:45 am EDT Print Email Tweet Clearly with St. Patrick’s Day falling on Friday, the volume of trading dropped as Wall Street enjoyed the festivities. However, once again the market continued the inexorable climb higher this past week. For the first time this year, the insider buying volume looked to be much closer to the selling in share count, though insider sellers still seemed to dominate in the dollar amount. Either way, with earnings season right around the corner, you can bet many insiders are taking advantage of open transaction windows. We cover insider selling every week at 24/7 Wall St., and we like to remind readers that just because an individual or 10% institutional owner sells stock, that is no cause for immediate alarm. Many top executives, and even directors, are compensated with stock and often sell just to diversify portfolios or purchase other assets. Here are companies that reported notable insider selling this past week. One of the members of the richest family in America was again selling shares of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE: WMT) this past week. Robson Walton parted with a block of 3 million shares of the iconic retailer at prices that ranged from $70.34 to $70.86 apiece. The total for the sale was a stunning $212 million. Shares closed last Friday at $69.89. The 52-week trading range for the stock is $62.72 to $75.19, and the Wall Street consensus price target is $74.37. Another famous American company caught a seller last week. Eastman Kodak Co. (NYSE: KODK) had a 10% owner selling shares. Blue Mountain Capital sold a total of 1,353,653 shares, and prices ranged from $11.54 to $11.75 a share. The total for the sale was set at $16 million. The shares closed Friday at $11.50, in a 52 week range of $10 to $17.30. There was no consensus target as the stock is not followed on Wall Street. Del Taco Restaurants Inc. (NASDAQ: TACO) had a director at the company selling stock last week. The board member shed a total of 831,314 shares at between $11.40 and $11.84 apiece. The total for the sale was $10 million. The shares ended the week at $12.36, in a 52-week range of $8.43 to $15.32. The consensus price target is $17.07. Another director at Tyler Technologies Inc. (NYSE: TYL) was also busy selling stock last week. That director sold a total of 53,069 shares of the integrated information management solutions provider at prices that ranged from $155.24 to $156.26. The total for the sale was set at $8 million. The stock closed Friday at $156.35. The consensus price target is $180.09, and the 52-week range is $118.16 to $175.17. Analog Devices Inc. (NYSE: ADI) has been on a huge run, and a director at the chip company took advantage by selling a block of 50,000 shares of the stock at prices that ranged from $83.00 to $83.50. The total of the sale was set at $4 million. The shares ended Friday at $83.26, in a 52-week trading range is $52.17 to $84.24. The consensus price target is $89.42. These companies also reported insider selling last week: Corcept Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ: CORT), Customers Bancorp Inc. (NYSE: CUBI), Ellie Mae Inc. (NYSE: ELLI), Fiserv Inc. (NASDAQ: FISV) and Ulta Beauty Inc. (NASDAQ: ULTA). It is pretty safe to assume we will continue to see insider selling strong until earnings season, and if the market stays at or trades up from current levels, the volume and dollar amount could go up as well.

Print Email Michaelangelo Conte | The Jersey Journal By Michaelangelo Conte | The Jersey Journal The Jersey Journal Follow on Twitter on March 18, 2017 at 9:58 AM comments JERSEY CITY - A 22-year-old Pennsylvania woman has been charged with kicking a police officer arresting her following a disturbance at Walmart in Kearny on Thursday. Aniyyah Harrell is charged with aggravated assault on a police officer, resisting arrest and purposely causing or recklessly creating the risk of public inconvenience, annoyance or alarm, the criminal complaint says. Responding officers said they were flagged down by about 15 customers and employees who directed them to the grocery section vestibule where Harrell was assaulting someone, the criminal complaint says. "Harrell's behavior was out of control as she was kicking, pulling away from officer, screaming and cursing." When the officers managed to calm Harrell down, she allegedly provided a fake name, the complaint says. An officer helped Harrell make a few phone calls in an attempt to get a ride but she again became belligerent and violent and the officers placed her under arrest. While being handcuffed, Harrell allegedly kicked an officer in the knee twice, the complaint says. Harrell made her first appearance on the charges yesterday in Criminal Justice Reform Court in Jersey City via video link from Hudson County jail in Kearny. At the hearing, she was order released pending trial with conditions of supervision.

Here's what the company has planned to stay relevant in a digital world. Nicholas Rossolillo (nrossolillo) Mar 18, 2017 at 6:43AM Target (NYSE:TGT) has been pummeled after reporting disappointing 2016 holiday sales and forecasting falling profits in the year ahead. The big-box store is battling a tough retail environment brought on by falling foot traffic as an increasing number of shoppers opt for an online experience. Data by YCharts. Recent investor pessimism was sparked partly by fourth-quarter numbers that showed a fall in revenue and comparable sales, which declined 4.3% and 1.5%, respectively. The other reason for worry coming out of the fourth-quarter report was that management said 2017 earnings per share will come in between $3.80 and $4.20, a 15% decrease at the midpoint from 2016. The reason for the expected drop in the bottom line? Target plans to spend $1 billion in 2017 out of its operating profits to adapt its business model to changing shopper preferences. Over the next three years, a total of $7 billion in investment is planned. It's ambitious, and investors are obviously nervous about it, but Target is ready to fight back against declines in sales. Target's history of innovation Target is no stranger to changing consumer shopping preferences. In the early 1900s, Target, then known as Dayton's after the family that owned it, was a regional department store in the Midwest. By the 1960s, the Dayton's department store chain was doing well in its home state of Minnesota. Times were changing, though, and big-box discount retailers like Wal-Mart were just beginning to pop up around the country. The Daytons decided to jump in the game and launch a new type of discount chain, one that combined department store qualities with the value slant that many shoppers were looking for. The new format was named Target. A Dayton's Department Store in the 1950s. Image source: Target. Times are changing again, but this time, physical stores in general are under attack from more convenient online competition like Amazon.com. Target was an early adopter of online shopping and launched its own digitally formatted store back in 1999, but sales from it have remained a very small part of the overall business. The problem and the solution However, it's worth noting that, since 2013, Target has doubled sales from the internet. In the last reported quarter, online sales increased 34% from the previous year, with digital sales making up 6.8% of sales. However, the problem has been that the move to online hasn't been able to outpace declines in foot traffic. To stop the bleeding, Target's upcoming spending spree is aimed at adapting business to what the consumers now want, including a streamlined digital shopping experience, exclusive brands, competitive prices, and faster delivery. The merchandiser will continue to enhance its online experience, but its existing stores will also play an important role in digital strategy. For starters, by 2019, all physical locations will serve the secondary purpose of distribution center. When customers shop online, their order will be delivered from their nearest Target location. That helps delivery times, but also helps the company operate more efficiently. Target has also been experimenting with smaller-format stores in urban areas and on college campuses. Thirty more are planned to cut ribbons this year, doubling the company's reach with the small format. Other features that will be available this year will include the ability for Target associates to search inventory, place orders, and arrange delivery of merchandise for guests who can't find what they're looking for in-store. Image source: Target. The final area of work will involve the launch of 12 new exclusive brands, an area that has been successful in the past. Over the last year, Target has reported positive sales growth from its exclusive line-ups even while overall sales have struggled. Look for more information in the months ahead on what these new brands will be. Can Target pull it off? Target will be attempting a comeback in a crowd of other traditional retailers all trying to navigate the move to a digital-first shopping experience. It will be a difficult task since Amazon already has a substantial lead in the online selling world. Even in the midst of a tough year, though, Target has managed to increase its free cash flow, or money left over after operating expenses are paid for. Data by YCharts. That spare change will play an important role in the years ahead. Investors can expect to see this metric drop as the company puts some of it to work executing its new plans. Ultimately, the real test will be if sacrificing profitability can help grow top-line sales. Nicholas Rossolillo owns shares of Target. The Motley Fool has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

This Popular Natural Food Grocer Now Ranks Dead Last in Customer Loyalty A new survey by Brand Keys may explain this grocer's recent woes. Jeremy Bowman (TMFHobo) Mar 18, 2017 at 7:09AM For years, the natural and organic grocery sector was a growth star in an otherwise sleepy industry. Companies like Whole Foods Market (NASDAQ:WFM) and Sprouts Farmers (NASDAQ:SFM) spread like wildfire across the country, trouncing the industry in same-store sales. Through the aughts, Whole Foods' comparable sales were regularly in the double digits as it introduced a new kind of gourmet emporium to much of the country, complete with olive bars and cheesemongers. More recently, though, things have changed. Mainstream grocers like Kroger, Wal-Mart, and Costco have caught on to the organic movement, introducing brands and using their economies of scale to undercut competitors like Whole Foods and Sprouts on price. Image source: Getty Images. As a result, stocks in the organic segment have plummeted.  SFM data by YCharts. As the chart above shows, leading natural foods suppliers like United Natural Foods (NASDAQ:UNFI) and Hain Celestial (NASDAQ:HAIN) also took a hit from the industry shift. Still, another surprising trend appears to be afoot in the industry.  Brand Keys, a consulting firm that does an annual Customer Loyalty Engagement Index, has measured such relationships between consumers and brands for years across several industries. Customer loyalty is a key factor for almost all companies' success, but especially for grocers who rely on repeat customer visits. Without customer loyalty, grocers are much more likely to lose business to competitors.   Surprisingly, Brand Keys found that the company ranking dead last in customer loyalty among natural food stores was Whole Foods, the company generally considered to be the industry leader.  Trader Joe's ranked No. 1 in the survey, followed by The Fresh Market, which was taken private last year by Apollo Global Management, and then Sprouts, and finally Whole Foods.  Is Whole Foods broken? Perhaps it shouldn't be surprising that Whole Foods would rank last in customer loyalty in its industry. The company has seen comparable sales fall for six quarters in a row as management has struggled to turn around performance. The company, long derided as "Whole Paycheck" by detractors who claimed that their prices were too high, also saw its reputation take a hit when an NYC investigation in 2015 found the company had been mis-weighing some packaged items and was therefore overcharging some customers, which caused a brief sales dip as the news went national. Whole Foods has not been sitting still as its sales have wilted, though. To combat its reputation for high prices, the company has begun offering more sales and discounts, and it even introduced a loyalty program. CEO John Mackey has said that the company is trying to compete on quality rather than price, but he understands the need to be competitive on pricing.  Image source: They Motley Fool. Last year, Whole Foods also launched a new budget-priced chain, 365, which is targeted at millennials and bears a close resemblance to Trader Joe's. The new concept heavily features Whole Foods' private-label 365 brand and prepared foods and eschews the specialists like butchers and fishmongers that are found at a traditional Whole Foods. The company also streamlined its management structure, eliminating the co-CEO positions, along with former co-CEO Walter Robb, in favor of just one CEO. None of those changes have had a noticeable effect on sales or the bottom line for Whole Foods, though, as the company continues to struggle with headwinds affecting the entire industry like food deflation, which has brought down retail prices across the board. That the rest of the natural foods sector is challenged may indicate that the company is not fully responsible for its own problems, but the industry is quickly changing. Whole Foods faces competition from more than just traditional grocers. Meal-kit services have popped up lately, allowing to the kind of customers Whole Foods targets to skip the trip to the grocery store and get their weekly dinners in a box. Similarly, farmers markets and community-supported agriculture co-ops have also become more popular, relieving the need for grocery-store visits. Consumers are also increasingly seeking out delivery options as well, and Amazon has spread its Fresh grocery delivery service to most major metropolitan areas across the country. Whole Foods' latest guidance was also discouraging as the company sees comparable sales for the fiscal year ending in September falling as much as 2.5%. Comparable sales will eventually hit bottom, but it's clear from both Whole Foods' and the overall industry's results that the days of double-digit comp sales increases are not coming back. At this point, Whole Foods stock seems unlikely to return to its former heights. John Mackey, CEO of Whole Foods Market, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Follow Raw Story! Follow @rawstory Brian Thiede, Pennsylvania State University; Lillie Greiman, The University of Montana; Stephan Weiler, Colorado State University; Steven C. Beda, University of Oregon, and Tessa Conroy, University of Wisconsin-Madison Editor’s note: We’ve all heard of the great divide between life in rural and urban America. But what are the factors that contribute to these differences? We asked sociologists, economists, geographers and historians to describe the divide from different angles. The data paint a richer and sometimes surprising picture of the U.S. today. 1. Poverty is higher in rural areas Discussions of poverty in the United States often mistakenly focus on urban areas. While urban poverty is a unique challenge, rates of poverty have historically been higher in rural than urban areas. In fact, levels of rural poverty were often double those in urban areas throughout the 1950s and 1960s. While these rural-urban gaps have diminished markedly, substantial differences persist. In 2015, 16.7 percent of the rural population was poor, compared with 13.0 percent of the urban population overall – and 10.8 percent among those living in suburban areas outside of principal cities. Contrary to common assumptions, substantial shares of the poor are employed. Approximately 45 percent of poor, prime-age (25-54) householders worked at least part of 2015 in rural and urban areas alike. The link between work and poverty was different in the past. In the early 1980s, the share of the rural poor that was employed exceeded that in urban areas by more than 15 percent. Since then, more and more poor people in rural areas are also unemployed – a trend consistent with other patterns documented below. That said, rural workers continue to benefit less from work than their urban counterparts. In 2015, 9.8 percent of rural, prime-age working householders were poor, compared with 6.8 percent of their urban counterparts. Nearly a third of the rural working poor faced extreme levels of deprivation, with family incomes below 50 percent of the poverty line, or approximately US$12,000 for a family of four. Large shares of the rural workforce also live in economically precarious circumstances just above the poverty line. Nearly one in five rural working householders lived in families with incomes less than 150 percent of the poverty line. That’s nearly five percentage points more than among urban workers (13.5 percent). According to recent research, rural-urban gaps in working poverty cannot be explained by rural workers’ levels of education, industry of employment or other similar factors that might affect earnings. Rural poverty – at least among workers – cannot be fully explained by the characteristics of the rural population. That means reducing rural poverty will require attention to the structure of rural economies and communities. – Brian Thiede, Assistant Professor of Rural Sociology and Demography, Pennsylvania State University 2. Most new jobs aren’t in rural areas It’s easy to see why many rural Americans believe the recession never ended: For them, it hasn’t. Rural communities still haven’t recovered the jobs they lost in the recession. Census data show that the rural job market is smaller now – 4.26 percent smaller, to be exact – than it was in 2008. In these data are shuttered coal mines on the edges of rural towns and boarded-up gas stations on rural main streets. In these data are the angers, fears and frustrations of much of rural America. This isn’t a new trend. Mechanization, environmental regulations and increased global competition have been slowly whittling away at resource extraction economies and driving jobs from rural communities for most of the 20th century. But the fact that what they’re experiencing now is simply the cold consequences of history likely brings little comfort to rural people. If anything, it only adds to their fear that what they once had is gone and it’s never coming back. Nor is it likely that the slight increase in rural jobs since 2013 brings much comfort. As the resource extraction economy continues to shrink, most of the new jobs in rural areas are being created in the service sector. So Appalachian coal miners and Northwest loggers are now stocking shelves at the local Walmart. The identity of rural communities used to be rooted in work. The signs at the entrances of their towns welcomed visitors to coal country or timber country. Towns named their high school mascots after the work that sustained them, like the Jordan Beetpickers in Utah or the Camas Papermakers in Washington. It used to be that, when someone first arrived at these towns, they knew what people did and that they were proud to do it. That’s not so clear anymore. How do you communicate your communal identity when the work once at the center of that identity is gone, and calling the local high school football team the “Walmart Greeters” simply doesn’t have the same ring to it? Looking at rural jobs data, is it so hard to understand why many rural people are nostalgic for the past and fearful for the future? – Steven Beda, Instructor of History, University of Oregon 3. Disabilities are more common in rural areas Disability matters in rural America. Data from the American Community Survey, an annual government poll, reveal that disability is more prevalent in rural counties than their urban counterparts. The rate of disability increases from 11.8 percent in the most urban metropolitan counties to 15.6 percent in smaller micropolitan areas and 17.7 percent in the most rural, or noncore, counties. While rural-urban differences in disability have been analyzed previously, researchers have had little opportunity to further explore this disparity, as updated data on rural disability were unavailable until recently. Fortunately, the census released updated new county-level disability estimates in 2014, ending a 14-year knowledge gap. The release of these estimates has also allowed us to build a picture of geographic variations in disability across the nation. Disability rates vary significantly across the U.S. Although the national trend of higher disability rates in rural counties persists at the regional and even divisional level, it is clear that disability in rural America is not homogeneous. Rates of rural disability range from around 15 percent in the Great Plains to 21 percent in the central South. Data reveal notable differences between rural and urban America. American Community Survey (ACS) 2011-2015 5 year estimates, Table S1810, CC BY A variety of factors may be behind these regional and rural differences, including differences in demographics, economic patterns, health and service access and state disability policies. While this survey provides a glimpse into the national prevalence of disability and reveals a persistent rural-urban disparity, it is important to note its limitations. Disability is the result of an interaction between an individual and his or her environment. Therefore, these data do not directly measure disability, as they measure only physical function and do not consider environmental factors such as inaccessible housing. – Lillie Greiman and Andrew Myers, Project Directors at the Rural Institute for Inclusive Communities at the University of Montana; Christiane von Reichert, Professor of Geography, University of Montana 4. Rural areas are surprisingly entrepreneurial The United States’ continuing economic dominance is perhaps most attributable to the very smallest elements of its economy: its entrepreneurial start-ups. Nearly 700,000 new job-creating businesses open each year. That’s almost 2,000 every day, each helping to create new market niches in the global economy. Most people mistakenly believe these pioneering establishments occur in overwhelmingly in metropolitan areas, such as in the now-mythic start-up culture of Silicon Valley. Yet, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, it is in fact nonmetropolitan counties that have higher rates of self-employed business proprietors than their metropolitan counterparts. Furthermore, the more rural the county, the higher its level of entrepreneurship. Some of these counties have a farming legacy – perhaps the most entrepreneurial of occupations – but farmers represent less than one-sixth of business owners in nonmetro areas. Even for nonfarm enterprises, rural entrepreneurship rates are higher. The reality is that rural areas have to be entrepreneurial, as industries with concentrations of wage and salary jobs are necessarily scarce. Start-up businesses have notoriously difficult survival prospects. So it is perhaps even more surprising that relatively isolated nonmetropolitan businesses are on average more resilient than their metro cousins, despite the considerable economic advantages of urban areas, which boast a denser networks of workers, suppliers and markets. The resilience of rural start-ups is perhaps due to more cautious business practices in areas with few alternative employment options. This resilience is also remarkably persistent over time, consistently being at least on par with metro start-ups, and regularly having survival rates up to 10 percentage points higher than in metro areas over 1990-2007. – Stephan Weiler, Professor of Economics, Colorado State University; Tessa Conroy and Steve Deller, Professors of Economics, University of Wisconsin-Madison Brian Thiede, Assistant Professor of Rural Sociology and Demography, Pennsylvania State University; Lillie Greiman, Research Associate, The University of Montana; Stephan Weiler, Professor of Economics, Colorado State University; Steven C.

That means trouble for the federal deficit and for Congress’ fiscal conservatives who repeatedly warn about leaving their children and grandchildren worse off financially. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite) Washington — Republicans intent on scrapping Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act have a budget problem. As it turns out, repealing and replacing the law they hate so much won't save nearly as much money as getting rid of it entirely, the goal they've been campaigning on for seven years. That means trouble for the federal deficit and for Congress' fiscal conservatives who repeatedly warn about leaving their children and grandchildren worse off financially. President Donald Trump and other GOP leaders know they can't just get rid of the law; instead they've vowed to "repeal and replace" it. So they've come up with a bill that would fix Obama's "disaster" and insist it would give Americans more choices on health coverage. But it only reduces the deficit by $337 billion over a decade and doesn't move the federal budget much closer to being balanced, if at all. That's one big reason many budget-conscious Republicans have joined Democrats in opposing the repeal-and-replace version pushed by the White House and House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis. In proposing his 2018 budget on Thursday, Trump called for spending billions more on defense while slashing domestic programs. He vowed during the campaign to leave the costly mandatory programs such as Medicare and Social Security untouched, and he won't raise taxes. That budget plan guarantees large deficits. "Our military is more important to me than a balanced budget," Trump said in a Fox News interview in January. The initial Republican plan to completely scuttle the 2010 health care law promised a cut of more than $2 trillion from the deficit over 10 years. The GOP health care bill cuts the deficit by much less. "Now that (health care repeal) is actually going to happen, they've changed their priorities greatly so that they're not actually trying to generate any significant savings," said Maya MacGuineas, president of Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a Washington-based advocacy group for budget discipline. "And there's no sign what they can fill it in with." A senior member of the House Budget Committee, Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., says: "Oh yeah, there's no question. It's much tougher, much tougher" to balance the budget after repealing and replacing the health care law. What would be left behind, according to the Congressional Budget Office, is $9 trillion in projected deficits over the coming decade and fewer ways for Trump and Republicans controlling Congress to cut. The worsening deficit creates a huge problem for other critical pieces of Trump's agenda, including tax reform, a big infusion of infrastructure spending or helping people with the costs of child care. First, swelling deficits mean less money for such legislation. The deepening debt hole also means problems when Republicans try to pass a budget outline this spring, since some tea party Republicans and deficit hard-liners will insist on promising to balance the budget even though the math no longer works. More realistic lawmakers will resist that. Under the arcane congressional budget process, the yearly budget blueprint doesn't by itself make any changes to government programs, but it makes it easier to enact follow-up legislation like tax reform, which is the top GOP priority after dealing with health care. But if they can't pass a budget, Republicans can't pass tax reform — at least without help from Senate Democrats — because of Senate rules. The fiscal picture, meanwhile, has another complication. If Republicans can successfully pass their health care repeal and replacement they will have used up their opportunity to cut Medicaid to generate savings toward a balanced budget. The health measure promises an enormous $880 billion cut from Medicaid over 10 years and it's not credible to say Republicans could claim more in subsequent legislation. "They've taken (Medicaid) off the table," said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a conservative economist and former Congressional Budget Office director. "The math doesn't work," said Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md. "Just nothing that they're doing adds up right now." How big is the problem? According to calculations by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, if House Republicans were to simply plug their health repeal and replace bill into last year's budget resolution, they would fall $350 billion short of balance by the end of their 10-year goal. And if further Medicaid savings are taken off the table, the gap is more like $500 billion. "It's going to be extremely difficult," admitted budget panel member Cole. U.S. temporarily bans larger electronics from cabins of certain flights Published: Tuesday, March 21, 2017 @ 3:07 AM By: Patrick McMahon, Rare.us Woman typing on laptop computer in commercial airplane (Jason Dewey / The Image Bank / Getty Images)(Jason Dewey/Getty Images) Jason Dewey/Getty Images A temporary ban on carry-on electronics is set to take effect Tuesday on certain flights into the U.S., according to reporting from The Hill and supported by tweets posted by Royal Jordanian Airlines. Those tweets have since been deleted but read, “Following instructions from the concerned U.S. departments, we kindly inform our dearest passengers departing to and arriving from the United States that carrying any electronic or electrical device on board the flight cabins is strictly prohibited,” according to The Hill. >> Read more trending news The ban will be formally announced Tuesday but is said to affect 13 countries for the next 96 hours and is a response to a specific intelligence threat, The Hill reported, citing Fox News. The ban reportedly has nothing to do with President Donald Trump’s travel ban, two versions of which have now been struck down by courts across the country. Affected countries, airlines and flights are in the process of being informed, CNN reported. The ban reportedly applies to all electronics except mobile phones and medical devices; items such as laptops, tablets and cameras may not be brought into the cabin but can fly in checked luggage.

In that story, “How the White House made me Real News,” she came to the conclusion that either White House officials “read it and loved it, especially the part where I wrote that all schoolchildren will be taught by an F-35 in a Make America Great Again hat, or they … did not read it but liked the headline.” The White House has yet to comment on the presumed mistake.

Required fields are marked * Name * Email * Website three  +   =  8 Comment Some HTML is OK Sign me up for the Money Morning newsletter The markets have soared since Donald Trump won the presidency, with the Dow up 14.5% since Nov. 8. But that doesn't mean every stock is climbing. In fact, some of the best profit opportunities in the market can be found in the three top stocks to short, which are all dropping quickly. The recent rally for the Dow is part of a much longer rally for the index. In the past year alone the Dow is up almost 21%, and it's up 190% over its eight-year bull run. While the markets as a whole may be rising, the top stocks to short today that we're targeting have lost between 15% and 40% of their value in 2017 alone. And the dips won't stop there… The losses stem from systemic issues that will be extremely difficult to overcome. And it's not far-fetched to think these companies will eventually declare bankruptcy, driving share prices to $0. The first of the top stocks to short has been hanging on to "nostalgia" too long and has continually failed to innovate…. Stocks to Short No. 3: Avon Products Inc. (NYSE: AVP) "The company for women" was founded in 1886. Since then, the iconic slogan of "Avon calling" has become synonymous with the door-to-door sale of cosmetics. Despite an amazing history of helping women, Avon Products Inc.'s (NYSE: AVP) future is troubling. Surprisingly, one of the first trends that has led to Avon's demise is the increase of women entering the workforce. In 1950, only about 30% of women participated in the workforce. By 1990, about 60% of women worked outside of the home. Must See: This Great Depression-Era "Secret" Helped Transform Two Teachers into Millionaires. Read more… On the surface, women working should be good for a cosmetics company. The issue is twofold, though. First, women were not home during the day to answer the door when the Avon ladies made their rounds. The second issue is that door-to-door sales became less appealing as more opportunities for women became available. In fact, Avon saw a decline of 2% in active representatives just last quarter. Fewer sales representatives means lower revenue, which declined 2.4% last quarter. If that wasn't enough, Avon has also been facing increased competition. For starters, high-quality and affordable cosmetics are easy to find everywhere women shop these days. Drug stores, grocery stores, even Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE: WMT), all have a large selection of cosmetics. In these stores you can see the physical product before you buy. When you order from Avon, you either order online or from a catalog. High-end stores have been gaining in popularity for those who want a consultation and to try products before they buy. Ulta Beauty Inc. (Nasdaq: ULTA), MAC Cosmetics, and Sephora USA Inc. all have stores where you can try products. They also have knowledgeable staff that can help you make selections based on your skin type and preferences, something an Avon representative used to help with. The last part of the Avon model was convenience. You didn't need to leave your house to buy cosmetics. The representative came to you. These days the Internet has taken over the convenience market. In fact, 73% said Amazon.com Inc. (Nasdaq: AMZN) was their number one destination for beauty products in a 2015 eMarketer survey. All of this has led to decreasing revenue and profit over the last five years. So in a last-ditch effort to regain profitability, Avon entered a restructuring deal with Cerberus Capital Management LP in December 2015. Cerberus specializes in investing in distressed companies. Having to make a deal with this company in order to get the cash you need is never a good thing. In the deal, Avon spun off its underperforming North American business. Avon then sold 80.1% of the business to Cerberus for $170 million. Despite unloading the underperforming arm of the business, Avon still has a lot going against it. Avon's international business (that the company owns the majority stake in) has been marred in controversy since 2008. The company has faced Chinese corruption charges, animal-testing allegations, and labor harassment accusations in Turkey. The once-iconic brand is falling hard. AVP stock has dropped 15.67% so far in 2017 and is currently trading at $4.28 per share. But we expect the stock to continue falling even further as punitive fines from the harassment accusations are levied. This next company to short continues to make headlines for its purportedly illegal business practices… Stocks to Short No. 2: Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. (NYSE: VRX) Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. (NYSE: VRX) is known for its questionable business practices. The company is notorious for buying smaller pharmaceutical companies (financed with debt), firing the staff of the newly acquired company, and dramatically raising prices of the new drugs at its disposal. Valeant has also been accused of defrauding insurers. This led to a criminal investigation in August 2016. The allegations pointed to close ties to Philidor Rx Services LLC, a mail-order pharmacy that has since gone under. Philidor worked on behalf of Valeant to persuade insurers to approve the higher-priced Valeant drugs over cheaper alternatives in exchange for kickbacks. By November 2016, charges were filed against Gary Tanner, a former executive of Valeant, and Andrew Davenport, the former CEO of Philidor. They were charged with federal wire fraud and money laundering. The media coverage of the investigations into Valeant's business practices, along with a push for generic drugs, caused a decline in sales and profit. In 2014, the company announced operating income of $2 billion. However, 2016 saw an operating loss of $566 million. This decline in profitability spells disaster when coupled with the ever-increasing debt load that will be subjected to higher interest rates when refinanced. The company's long-term debt has almost doubled between 2014 and 2016 from $15.229 billion to $29.846 billion. Declining profits are already putting pressure on this highly leveraged company. The fines that are sure to follow the criminal investigations may be the final nail in the coffin for Valeant. So far this year, VRX stock has declined 25% and currently trades for $10.98. It is likely the stock will continue to crumble as ex-executives are convicted of crimes and the U.S. Department of Justice issues fines for the company. While 25% is a large three-month decline, this next company is down almost 40% so far this year, and the losses show no sign of stopping… Join the conversation.

Pret-a-Reporter Fashion Week New York Fashion Week London Fashion Week Milan Fashion Week Paris Fashion Week Reviews Beauty Red Carpet Retail Report Subscribe Newsletters Facebook Twitter Instagram Tumblr The Hollywood Reporter Billboard Subscribe Newsletters Pret-a-Reporter Fashion Week New York Fashion Week London Fashion Week Milan Fashion Week Paris Fashion Week Reviews Beauty Red Carpet Retail Report Americans Were Cautious Spenders in February Despite Economic Optimism 11:47 AM PDT 3/15/2017 by Christopher Rugaber, Associated Press FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Leon Neal/Getty Images Compared to January, spending in February saw minimal growth. Americans spent only slightly more last month at retail stores compared with January, a sign of consumer caution despite rising optimism about the economy. The Commerce Department said Wednesday retail sales ticked up a seasonally adjusted 0.1 percent in February, after a much bigger gain of 0.6 percent the previous month. January's gain was revised higher. The figures suggest that strong job gains this year, near record-high stock prices and decent pay gains haven't yet lifted spending. But last month's sluggish pace could prove temporary. Economists note that spending was likely held back by delays in tax refund payments. A new law has required tougher scrutiny of a tax credit claimed by lower-income taxpayers. Walmart said last month that the delay had slowed sales at its stores in February. Other retailers have reported similar concerns. Yet tax refunds have started to flow this month, which could trigger a rebound. Economists also were encouraged by the upward revisions to January's sales data, which point to potentially faster growth in the first three months of the year. A separate report showed inflation rose in February and is now comfortably above the Federal Reserve's target of 2 percent. The Fed is expected to announce its third rate hike in 15 months on Wednesday. "Inflation is trending gradually higher and underlying retail sales are healthy enough," said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics. "Nothing here to suggest the Fed shouldn't raise interest rates at the FOMC meeting that concludes later today." Sales rose in February at furniture stores and home and garden centers. But they fell sharply at electronics and appliance stores. Sales also fell at gas stations, though that mostly reflects lower prices. Clothing stores, sporting goods retailers and department stores also all reported lower sales. There are several additional factors that could drive spending higher in the months ahead. Consumer confidence soared to its highest level in more than 15 years in February, according to the Conference Board, a business research group. Hiring and average hourly pay growth have picked up since the new year. Americans' finances are in better shape, with average home prices back to their pre-recession levels in much of the country. Yet the boost in confidence may not be broadly shared. That could limit any spending that might result. For Americans younger than age 35, who are less likely than older age groups to own a home or stocks, confidence actually fell last month. And the consumer confidence data has grown increasingly political in recent years, with Republicans reporting much greater optimism than Democrats. That reverses a pattern that emerged under former President Barack Obama. Retail sales make up about one-third of total consumer spending, with the other two-thirds consisting of healthcare and other services. Economists closely monitor spending, because it makes up about 70 percent of the economy. Growth has yet to catch up with the recent burst of optimism that has followed Donald Trump's election. The economy expanded at a modest 1.9 percent pace in the final three months of last year. Most economists expect it will grow at roughly a 2 percent pace in the January-March quarter.

To spy on executives, you don't need permission, Just filings to the Securities and Exchange Commission. As a wise investor, you might pay attention To the buys and sells I'm about to mention. Elliott Management continues to accumulate shares in Arconic Inc. (ARNC) while it fights to oust Arconic's CEO. Following a buying spree in February, Elliott is the biggest shareholder in Arconic, owning about 13 percent of the company. Based in New York, Arconic is the raw-aluminum operation split off from Alcoa Inc. last November. It is one of this this year's best-performing stocks, up 44.7 percent through March 10. Elliott Management, one of the largest hedge fund organizations, has said it would put Larry Lawsen, formerly the CEO of Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc., in charge of Arconic. I made good money investing in Spirit AeroSystems in 2013-16, and I think Lawson would do a good job at Arconic. Spirit says if Lawson takes that job, he would be violating a non-compete clause. I doubt that Spirit will win that dispute. Even if it does, I still think Lawson will take the helm at Arconic if the dissidents win. Arconic's current CEO, Klaus Christian Kleinfeld, wants to stay on. He owns about $24.6 million in Arconic stock, $17.7 million in Alcoa and 2.4 million in Morgan Stanley shares. If he loses this proxy fight, he may be sad but he will not be broke. If I were an Arconic shareholder, I would be voting the “blue card” to bring the dissidents to power. International fragrances I'm not sure whether Elliott will experience any “buyer's remorse” if it captures Arconic. But I suspect that may happen with Winder Investment PTE's recent purchases in International Flavors and Fragrances Inc. (IFF). Winder is a private company is Singapore. I consider International Flavors a good company. But its revenue growth has slowed to less than 2 percent annually in recent years. Meanwhile, the stock reflects the company's excellent reputation. It sells for 23 times earnings and six times book value (corporate net worth per share). Winder has recently added 280,000 shares to its position in the company. It now owns 10.4 percent of the company, or 8.2 million shares. Up to now, Winder has said it intends to be a passive investor. Chesapeake Energy At Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK), director and former chairman Archie Dunham recently purchased 500,000 shares, bringing his holding to 4.6 million shares worth almost $24 million. For more than a decade, under former CEO Aubrey McClendon, Chesapeake was a grab-all-you-can acquirer of natural gas assets. In the process, it ran the company's total liabilities up to a peak of $26 billion in 2012. Chesapeake shares peaked at more than $62 in 2008, and have fallen to a little above $5 now. Today, Chesapeake's net worth is negative. It may pull out of the hole and is trying hard to do so under new management that is selling off assets and shrinking the company. Such stories often end badly, though, and I'm not optimistic here. Wal-Mart Members of the Walton family have sold more than $1 billion of stock in Wal-Mart Inc. (WMT) in February and March. Yet it scarcely puts a dent in the family's holdings. The Walton clan owns more than 50 percent of the company, which is valued at $215 billion. Revenue at the retail giant grew at less than 4 percent the past five years, and just over 4 percent last year. Track record This is the 41st column I've written about insider trades. I've tabulated the 12-month results for all columns written from the beginning of 1999 through March 2016. •Stocks that I recommended and that showed insider buying beat the Standard & Poor's 500 Index by 6.50 percentage points, on average. •Stocks that showed insider buying but that I said I would avoid have trailed the S&P 500 by more than 27 percentage points. •Stocks that showed buying but where I made no clear recommendation have beaten the index by 15.9 points. •Stocks where I commented on insider selling have trailed the index by 1.69 points. One year ago, I said I found Bank of New York Mellon Corp. (BK) “attractive,” but recommended avoiding Hertz Global Holdings Inc. (HTX) and Boston Beer Co. (SAM). Bank of New York rose 30.8 percent. The other two fell 48.50 percent and 12.33 percent respectively. Bear in mind that my column recommendations are theoretical and don't reflect actual trades, trading costs or taxes. Their results shouldn't be confused with the performance of portfolios I manage for clients. And past performance doesn't predict future results.

Appointed to the Court himself in 1967, Marshall would take up the case against monopoly long championed by Justice Louis Brandeis, whose portrait hangs in the background. Donate Subscribe Share Tweet Print Email At the new National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, D.C., a hallway of glass display cases features more than a century of black entrepreneurial triumphs. In one is a World War II–era mini parachute manufactured by the black-owned Pacific Parachute Company, home to one of the nation’s first racially integrated production plants. Another displays a giant time clock from the R. H. Boyd Publishing Company, among the earliest firms to print materials for black churches and schools. Although small, the exhibit recalls a now largely forgotten legacy: by serving their communities when others wouldn’t, black-owned independent businesses provided avenues of upward mobility for generations of black Americans and supplied critical leadership and financial support for the civil rights movement. This tradition continues today. Last June, Black Enterprise magazine marked the forty-fourth anniversary of the BE 100s, the magazine’s annual ranking of the nation’s top 100 black-owned businesses. At the top of the list stood World Wide Technology, which, since its founding in 1990, has grown into a global firm with more than $7 billion in revenue and 3,000 employees. Then came companies like Radio One, whose fifty-five radio stations fan out among sixteen national markets. The combined revenues of the BE 100s, which also includes Oprah Winfrey’s Harpo Productions, now totals more than $24 billion, a ninefold increase since 1973, adjusting for inflation. A closer look at the numbers, however, reveals that these pioneering companies are the exception to a far more alarming trend. The last thirty years also have brought the wholesale collapse of black-owned independent businesses and financial institutions that once anchored black communities across the country. In 1985, sixty black-owned banks were providing financial services to their communities; today, just twenty-three remain. In eleven states that headquartered black-owned banks in 1994, not a single one is still in business. Of the fifty black-owned insurance companies that operated during the 1980s, today just two remain. Over the same period, tens of thousands of black-owned retail establishments and local service companies also have disappeared, having gone out of business or been acquired by larger companies. Reflecting these developments, working-age black Americans have become far less likely to be their own boss than in the 1990s. The per capita number of black employers, for example, declined by some 12 percent just between 1997 and 2014. What’s behind these trends, and what’s the implication for American society as a whole? To be sure, at least some of this entrepreneurial decline reflects positive economic developments. A slowly rising share of black Americans now hold white-collar salaried jobs and have more options for employment beyond running their own businesses. The movement of millions of black families to integrated suburbs over the last forty years also is a welcome trend, even if one effect has been to weaken the viability of the many black-owned independent businesses left behind in historically black neighborhoods. But the decline in entrepreneurship and business ownership among black Americans also is cause for concern. One reason is that it largely reflects not the opening of new avenues of upward mobility, but rather the foreclosing of opportunity. Rates of business ownership and entrepreneurship are falling among black citizens for much the same reason they are declining among whites and Latinos. As large retailers and financial institutions comprise an ever-bigger slice of the national economy, the possibility of starting and maintaining an independent business has dropped. The Washington Monthly has addressed the role of market concentration in suppressing opportunity and in displacing local economies in depth (see, for example, “The Slow-Motion Collapse of American Entrepreneurship,” July/August 2012, and “Bloom and Bust,” November/December 2015). Other studies, including a report published last year by President Obama’s Council of Economic Advisors, have substantiated these developments. The role of market concentration in depressing black-owned businesses is also troubling because of the critical role that such enterprises have played in organizing and financing the struggle for civil rights in America. In the 1950s and ’60s, black Americans employed by whites, including professionals like teachers, often faced dismissal if they joined the civil rights movement, whereas those who owned their own independent business had much greater freedom to resist. This is a largely forgotten history, but one that is gaining new urgency for all Americans in the age of Donald Trump. It shows the crucial way in which advancing and protecting basic civil rights can depend not only on moral and physical courage, but also on possessing the economic independence to stand up to concentrated power. The decline of black-owned independent businesses traces to many causes, but a major one that has been little noted was the decline in the enforcement of anti-monopoly and fair trade laws beginning in the late 1970s. Under both Democratic and Republican administrations, a few firms that in previous decades would never have been allowed to merge or grow so large came to dominate almost every sector of the economy. This change has hurt all independent businesses, but the effects have disproportionately hit black business owners. Marcellus Andrews, Bucknell University professor of economics, says that pulling back on anti-monopoly enforcement was a “catastrophic intellectual and political policy mistake,” and that for the black community, the “presumed price advantages of concentration often do not translate into better economic opportunities.” A case in point is the decline of black-owned financial institutions, including banks and insurance companies. “Mainstream insurers went after black insurance companies for their top personnel to sell their products,” says Wichita State professor Robert Weems Jr. When MetLife bought United Mutual Life Insurance Company in 1993, this was the end of the sixty-three-year existence of the last black-owned insurance company in the Northeast. Black Enterprise called the 1990s “a virtual bloodbath” for the black insurance industry, noting that from 1989 to 1999, the number of black-owned insurers declined by 68 percent. Parks Sausage—which many readers of a certain age may remember for its jingle “More Parks Sausages, Mom, please”—also serves as an example of how market concentration led to the decline of black-owned independent businesses. Founded in 1951 by Henry Parks Jr., the Baltimore-based company grew into a multimillion-dollar operation, selling pork products from New England to Virginia. In 1969, Parks took the company public, making the 200-employee firm the first black-owned business on the New York Stock Exchange. Yet by the 1990s, after a turbulent series of ownership changes, the company had fallen into bankruptcy. In 1996, two black Americans, the former football stars Franco Harris and Lydell Mitchell, attempted to revive the company, but faced an increasingly consolidated meatpacking industry in which the four largest meatpackers controlled 78 percent of the market. As Harris put it, before selling out, “it’s been hard to get distribution.” Much the same story occurs with black-owned grocers. In 1969, J. Bruce Llewellyn grew ten Bronx supermarkets into the nation’s largest minority-owned retail business. By the 1990s, however, a retreat from antitrust enforcement and other fair trade laws permitted a few giant corporations like Walmart to engage in anticompetitive behaviors that in previous decades would have resulted in civil and criminal prosecution. These included undermining the pricing power of suppliers and loss leading, or the practice of selling below cost in order to drive competitors out of business. In 1999, Llewellyn sold his last remaining stores to the Dayton-Hudson Corporation, now known as the Target Corporation. In 1986, a top executive at Revlon made a prediction about the future of the beauty and hair care industry. “In the next couple of years,” he told Newsweek, “the black-owned businesses will disappear. They’ll all be sold to white companies.” The prediction proved accurate. In 1993, IVAX Corp. purchased Johnson Products Co., the thirty-nine-year-old maker of Ultra Sheen, beginning a decade-long series of acquisitions that wiped out remaining black ownership in the hair care industry. One consequence was fewer new hair care products for black customers. Funds once channeled into research and development, University at Buffalo professor Robert Mark Silverman explains, now were accrued as profits by the larger firms. Much the same has happened to black-owned firms in the entertainment, communications, and publishing sectors. In response to the merger wave, the founder of Black Entertainment Television, Robert Johnson, told an audience at an investment conference in 1997, “You cannot get big anymore by being 100 percent black-owned anything.” Four years later, Viacom bought out BET for $2.34 billion. In 2005, Time Warner acquired Essence Communications Partners, the publisher of the then-leading black women’s magazine, Essence. Meanwhile, “small enterprises,” writes the business scholar John Sibley Butler, “could not compete with the expansion of larger retail chains, shopping malls, and franchises which developed.” Black-owned funeral homes are a prime example. During the civil rights era, writes author Suzanne Smith in her book To Serve the Living, “funeral directors were usually among the few black individuals in any town or city who were economically independent and not beholden to the local white power structure.” Yet, today, black-owned independent funeral homes are an imperiled institution, as national chains like Service Corporation International muscle out more and more businesses. Charlotte Clark, a black funeral home owner in Roanoke, Alabama, explains that these companies “buy local folks’ funeral parlors but leave up the signs and play it off like there’s been no change, but call the shots from elsewhere.” The National Funeral Directors and Morticians Association, which represents black funeral directors, has seen its membership decrease by 40 percent since 1997. Reflecting on the past three decades, Bob Dickerson, CEO of the Birmingham Business Resource Center in Alabama, says, “Had our institutions and businesses been maintained, had that money been plowed back into our communities, it could have meant a world of difference.” The role of market concentration in driving down the number of black-owned independent businesses becomes all the more concerning when one considers some mostly forgotten history. In principles, people, and tactics, the fight for black civil rights, going back to before the Civil War, was often deeply intertwined and aligned with America’s anti-monopoly traditions. An early example is the Free Soil Party. Emerging in the 1840s, its members opposed slavery on moral grounds. They also opposed all forms of monopoly power as a threat to liberty, including its most terrible manifestation: the monopoly of slave owners over slaves. Marching under the banner of “Free Soil, Free Speech, Free Labor, and Free Men,” the movement focused on granting equal citizenship to all Americans, in large part by promoting the then-radical idea of giving black freedmen and slaves the right to own the land on which they labored. Courtesy Black Enterprise No more Parks Sausages: Former National Football League star Franco Harris made the cover of Black Enterprise magazine in 1996 when he tried to rescue the first black-owned business listed on the New York Stock Exchange. A rapidly monopolizing meat processing industry doomed the effort. Free Soilers proposed breaking up land monopolies and dividing western lands into 50-to-100-acre homesteads that would grant white and black families independence. As the antebellum history scholar Jonathan Earle explains, “Opponents of aristocracy, land monopoly, and slavery saw yeoman farming and inalienable landownership as the true opposites of servitude.” It was therefore no surprise when Helen Douglass, the wife of the Free Soiler and abolitionist Frederick Douglass, wrote that his opposition against any type of coercion “not only made him a foe to American slavery, but also to all forms of monopoly.” After the Civil War, passage of the Fourteenth Amendment, which outlawed racially discriminatory laws like the Black Codes, depended in no small part on white supporters who saw it as a means of prohibiting all grants of monopoly or class privilege. An 1866 article in the Boston Daily Advertiser said it “[threw] the same shield over the black man as over the white, over the humble as over the powerful.” In fact, one of the earliest applications of the law was by a group of independent Louisiana butchers who argued that a state-sanctioned twenty-five-year slaughterhouse monopoly violated the Fourteenth Amendment. During Reconstruction, the relationship between black political enfranchisement and economic independence gained strength. Abolitionists in Congress passed the Southern Homestead Act, which promised to replace the monopoly of slavery with the creation of a black yeomanry secured with grants of free land. Like General William Tecumseh Sherman’s Special Field Order No. 15, with its promise of “forty acres of tillable ground” to newly freed slaves, it fell victim to white backlash and sectional compromise, and was rescinded. Nevertheless, by the 1890s, black Americans who owned or aspired to own their own land joined with independent white farmers in the multiracial Populist Party, in states including Georgia and Texas. Library of Congress Keeping it in the community: During the mid-twentieth century, anti-monopoly laws, particularly fair trade legislation, contributed to an increase in the number of black-owned, independent businesses like this one in Harlem. The natural alliance between supporters of black civil rights and opponents of monopoly, though strained by race-baiting demagogues, especially during the darkest days of Jim Crow, would endure. As a 1913 editorial by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) put it, the Emancipation Proclamation and the legacy of the Free Soil movement “gave black men not simply physical freedom, but it attempted to give them political freedom and economic freedom and social freedom. It knew then, as it knows now, that no people can be free unless they have the right to vote, the right to land and capital, and the right to choose their friends.” To be sure, many black leaders during this era recognized that economic independence was a necessary but not sufficient condition for securing full rights as citizens. Unlike their white counterparts, independent black business owners were vulnerable to the brutality of lynching, to voter suppression at the polls, and to the plundering of black business districts by white supremacists. Yet many black leaders nonetheless saw that the fight for racial justice also required expanded economic independence, which in turn depended on containing market concentration. In the early twentieth century, groups like the National Negro Business League, for instance, supported anti–chain store legislation as a way to preserve black Americans’ economic self-sufficiency and freedom. As an editorial in the black newspaper New Journal and Guide bemoaned, “Chain stores are constantly draining every dollar, every week, from all of our Southern communities . . . never putting any of it back so that the communities can use it again.” Indeed, many black leaders supported these laws, even though the Ku Klux Klan and many racist white populists also championed them for their own reasons. In 1928, W. E. B. Du Bois validated the black community’s embrace of anti-monopolism when he wrote, “To ask the individual colored man . . . to sell meat, shoes, candy, books, cigars, clothes or fruit in competition with the chain store, is to ask him to commit slow but almost inevitable economic suicide.” In 1932, the Associated Negro Press and the National Negro Business League, with the cooperation of the U.S. Department of Commerce, printed a newspaper column called “Business and Industry.” One article in the series noted that “an embarrassing problem confronts the 70,000 or more Negro-owned individual enterprises in the U.S. today[:] . . . Big Business, which so perceptibly handicaps the small industrial business units in which category Negro enterprise unquestionably belongs.” Coming into the New Deal era, the federal government adopted many policies that enormously benefited whites but did little or nothing to help black Americans. The Federal Housing Authority engaged in redlining, the destructive practice of refusing to issue mortgages in predominately black neighborhoods. The Wagner Act left black workers still unable to join unions. Black agricultural and domestic laborers couldn’t reap the benefits of Social Security. “Roosevelt’s New Deal,” Ta-Nehisi Coates has argued, “rested on the foundation of Jim Crow.” But the expansion of anti-monopoly laws that also occurred during this period provided one important exception to this pattern. These measures included stepped-up antitrust enforcement, along with new fair trade laws, like the Robinson-Patman Act of 1936 and the Miller-Tydings Act of 1937, that prevented dominant firms from exploiting their market power. Combined with anti–chain store measures passed in twenty-seven states, the new legal and regulatory constraints on market concentration benefited independent enterprise, including black-owned independent businesses. Between 1935 to 1939 the number of black-owned retail stores increased by 31 percent and the number of black employees hired by black-owned retail stores grew by 14.5 percent. Into the 1940s, black leaders battled segregation while continuing to advocate for anti-monopoly laws. In August 1941, the student organization Negro Youth published a list of demands from the National Defense Program, including “that the Attorney General investigate and prosecute all violations of the Sherman Antitrust laws.” In response to a 1947 New York fair trade law that prohibited loss leading, a coalition of black wholesale grocers declared that the law “will afford additional protection to the small businessman, be he Negro or white.” Independent business owners also played a key role in financing civil rights protests, especially during their peak in the 1950s and ’60s. In Tallahassee, black grocery store owner Daniel Speed bankrolled a bus boycott similar to that in Montgomery, and his shop served as a meeting ground for black leaders. In Biloxi, Gilbert R. Mason, owner of Modern Drug Store, led a “wade-in” against the whites-only section of a federally funded Gulf Coast beach. In his autobiography, Mason wrote, “Pharmacists represented an economically independent class of black businessmen who might have been thought difficult for the white establishment to control. In many cases, the black-owned pharmacy was itself a nexus in black communities.” Funeral home owners emerged as another powerful bloc of civil rights activists. In 1956, funeral home owner William Shortridge cofounded the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights, a group that sought to end employment discrimination and abolish segregation in public accommodations. A. G. Gaston, who built his business empire as the owner of the Smith and Gaston Funeral Home, threatened to transfer his accounts from a white-owned bank unless it removed a “Whites Only” sign from a water fountain. In 1963, he lent Martin Luther King Jr. a room at his Gaston Motel. Soon known as the “War Room,” it was there that King decided to submit himself to arrest in Birmingham, a galvanizing moment in the civil rights movement. King himself connected part of the civil rights movement with the struggle against market concentration. While giving a talk in 1961 to students at the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, King drew parallels between the Sherman Antitrust Act and discrimination in public accommodations, noting, “This is what is said in the Sherman [Antitrust] Act, that if a business is in the public market it cannot deny access . . . [a]nd I think the same thing applies here . . . that a man should not have the right to say on the basis of color or religion, one cannot use a lunch counter that is open to everyone else in another racial group but not to these particular people; he has an obligation to the public.” In this era, support for the civil rights movement and opposition to monopoly were political stands often advocated by the same person. For instance, Justice Felix Frankfurter, who made anti-monopoly policy one of the causes of his life, served on the NAACP’s National Legal Committee while also being the first member of the Supreme Court to hire a black law clerk. New York Representative Emanuel Celler sponsored the Celler-Kefauver Act of 1950, a major anti-monopoly law, and also introduced the Civil Rights Act in the House. Sargent Shriver, the architect of Lyndon Johnson’s War on Poverty program, said at a dinner reception describing his vision for anti-discrimination laws and programs like Head Start, VISTA, and Job Corps, “The day may well come when Congress enacts a new Sherman Act for the social field—an antitrust law to ensure that . . . monopoly power is not used to expand and perpetuate itself.” Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy similarly drew a link between civil rights and anti-monopoly policy. “The principles of free enterprise which the antitrust laws are designed to protect and vindicate,” he said in 1961, “are economic ideals that underlie the whole structure of a free society.” Two years later, King, in his sermon “On Being a Good Neighbor,” echoed Kennedy’s vision when he said, “Our unswerving devotion to monopoly capitalism makes us concerned about the economic security of the captains of industry, and not the laboring men whose sweat and skills keep the wheels of industry rolling.” Black Americans employed by whites, including professionals like teachers, often faced dismissal if they joined the civil rights movement, whereas those who owned their own independent business had much greater freedom to resist.A seminal moment in the history of the civil rights movement came on a bloody Sunday in 1965 when Alabama state troopers attacked John Lewis and hundreds of others marching across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in support of voting rights. Here, too, the important link between black-owned independent businesses and civil rights was operating behind the scenes. Civil rights leader Amelia Boynton and her husband, Sam, for example, dedicated half the office space of their real estate and insurance company in Selma to host organizers from the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee founder Bernard LaFayette also set up an office in Selma because he knew that the black commercial class would provide a measure of protection for activists. Betty Boynton, the wife of Sam and Amelia’s son Bruce, explained in an interview, “School administrators fired teachers and workers who were sympathetic to the movement.” Indeed, one of the reasons so much of the activity of the civil rights movement was centered in Selma is that its strong community of black business owners offered critical logistical, financial, and other forms of support. The link between civil rights and anti-monopoly policy also was a matter of tactics. In 1961, the owners of ten independent medical practices used the Sherman Antitrust Act against sixty-one local hospitals and medical organizations in Chicago that barred black Americans from the medical staff. The suit claimed that the hospitals, which provided more than 75 percent of the city’s private hospital beds, discriminated against black physicians. The settlement slowly helped integrate black citizens into the medical profession. In 1964, Reginald Johnson, secretary of the National Urban League, encouraged the use of antitrust laws to break up housing segregation in the nation’s cities. Of the twenty million dwellings built since World War II, only 3 percent had been open to black families. “Widespread conspiracies in flagrant restraint of trade,” Johnson said, “have confined millions of the nation’s Negro citizens to lives of squalor, misery, and privation.” Antitrust actions taken by the American Civil Liberties Union, the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, and other organizations helped force desegregation of neighborhoods and realty boards in cities including Trenton, St. Louis, Pittsburgh, Akron, and New York City. Bruce Boynton even sought to join the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division to combat discrimination and fight for greater equality. In a 1964 interview with Jet he said, “I purposely picked Antitrust instead of the Civil Rights section because we have to get involved in other areas, too. . . . Negroes have to learn how to operate stores, as well as boycott them.” He never made it to the Justice Department but made history anyway. The Alabama Bar Association refused to grant him his law license because of his previous arrest for refusing to leave a “Whites Only” lunch counter. Boynton’s protest led to the Supreme Court case Boynton v. Virginia, which helped desegregate interstate bus travel. NAACP lawyer Thurgood Marshall, who was already famous for having successfully argued Brown v. Board of Education, represented Boynton in that case. As it happens, Marshall later became the nation’s first black Supreme Court justice and one of the Court’s last great defenders of anti-monopoly laws. Marshall grew up in the largely middle-class Druid Hill neighborhood of Baltimore, the grandson of two grocery owners, and as a young boy worked in their stores. Marshall’s philosophy, his biographer Juan Williams writes, “was the result of being the child of a proud, politically active, black, middle-class family that owned successful businesses and lived in an integrated neighborhood.” His greatest defense of the anti-monopoly vision came in the majority opinion he authored in United States v. Topco Associates, in which he argued that “antitrust laws, in general, and the Sherman Act, in particular, are the Magna Carta of free enterprise.” After the late 1970s, both Democrats and Republicans generally retreated from the long-standing tradition of using anti-monopoly laws to foster economic and political equality. Since then, successive administrations have evaluated mergers only for their “efficiency,” and by and large have resisted antitrust actions except in the most egregious instances of collusion and price fixing. The subsequent three decades of merger mania have brought steep increases in both market concentration and inequality. Some members of the black community applauded these changes. In a 1986 interview, Dr. William Bradford, chairman of the University of Maryland Finance Department, said, “Selling out will result in gaining future expansion opportunities. . . . [Black businesses] will move up the hierarchy and control more resources.” But other voices expressed worry. An editorial in the Atlanta Daily World noted, “Mergers don’t always make for better service or lower prices to the consumer, and one certain result of weakening the antitrust laws is more and more mergers.” Indeed, the number of mergers did keep growing, and in most instances involved smaller black-owned companies being bought out by larger firms controlled by whites. In 1988, MCA and Boston Ventures bought Motown Records for $61 million. In 1995, Shorebank Corporation acquired Chicago’s black-owned Drexel Bank. In 1999, the French advertising giant Publicis Groupe acquired 49 percent of the black-owned marketing firm Burrell Communications Group. In 2005, a group of white investors purchased the nation’s oldest black-owned bank, Consolidated Bank & Trust Co. The process continues today. Indeed, one of the legacies of Obama’s economic policies has been a particularly sharp drop in the number of black-owned banks. This is not only the result of lessened enforcement of the anti-monopoly laws but also an unintended side effect of measures like the Dodd-Frank Act. In the process of attempting to keep big banks from failing, Dodd-Frank created regulatory burdens that small banks could not meet. These policy changes contributed to a 14 percent decrease in the number of community banks between 2010 and late 2014. Particularly hard hit were black-owned banks, which decreased by 24 percent during this period. Black-owned financial institutions and the businesses that depend on them for credit were also deeply damaged by the misallocation of bank bailout funds. Referring to the government’s Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), former Atlanta banker George Andrews says, “If there ever was a crime committed to our community it was in the way the government handled TARP funds.” According to a 2013 study of TARP investments, black-owned banks were ten times less likely to receive bailout money than nonminority-owned banks. Black Americans suffered disproportionately from the predatory lending practices of big banks and from the reform measures put in place to contain banks that had become too big to fail. The story of how the struggle for civil rights intertwined and intersected historically with the struggle against monopoly provides a lesson for the future. It suggests that going forward we also should consider how political independence connects with economic independence in the struggle for social justice. Without freedom from domination in one sphere, there is no freedom in the other. Allowing the powerful to corner markets erodes the democratic spirit that makes America great. Brian S.

Ogg March 14, 2017 9:05 am EDT Print Email Tweet Stocks were indicated to open lower on Tuesday while a massive blizzard is disrupting the northeastern United States. All eyes remain on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) ahead of this week’s interest rate hike decision, and the odds favor a hike. Even with the bull market now eight years old, investors have bought stocks on every pullback. Those same investors are also looking for new trading and investing ideas. 24/7 Wall St. reviews dozens of analyst research reports each day of the week. The goal is to find new investing ideas and trading ideas for our readers. Some analyst reports cover stocks to buy, while others cover stocks to sell or to avoid. Some color has been added on many of the following calls, and the consensus analyst price targets referenced are from Thomson Reuters. These are the top analyst upgrades, downgrades and initiations seen on Tuesday, March 14, 2017: Mobileye N.V. (NYSE: MBLY) saw its shares trade up 28% to $60.62 on Monday on news that Intel was acquiring the autonomous car chip player. Mobileye was downgraded to Hold from Buy at Jefferies and to Sector Perform from Outperform at RBC. Dougherty lowered its rating to Sell as a result of the buyout. Occidental Petroleum Corp. (NYSE: OXY) was raised to Outperform from Neutral at Credit Suisse, and the price target was raised to $79 from $77 (versus a $62.88 prior close). Occidental has a consensus analyst target price of $75.00, and it has a 52-week trading range of $61.01 to $78.48. Credit Suisse noted that Occidental is attractively valued and that its good inventory of low-cost Permian reserves is not reflected in the valuation. Oracle Corp. (NYSE: ORCL) was reiterated as Buy with a $48 price target (versus a $42.58 close) at Merrill Lynch. This was just a day after a more cautious call from a competing firm.

Many of retail's most iconic department stores are struggling to survive at a time when a growing number of consumers are choosing the ease of shopping online at Amazon, or gravitating toward the discounts and all-in-one shopping experience available at big box giants like Walmart. Sears announced in January that it would close 150 stores and sell its Craftsman tool brand, while Macy's closed 66 locations in its last fiscal year and is planning to close another 34. Neiman Marcus may already have a potential buyer. Canadian company Hudson's Bay which had reportedly been considering a merger with Macy's, is now interested in acquiring Neiman Marcus instead, according to CNBC which cited sources who spoke to Dow Jones.   Hudson's Bay had been trying to secure funding to potentially purchase Macy's according to previous reports. But investors were hesitant about a deal that would anchor them in shopping malls which are seeing declining foot traffic. Now, Hudson's Bay is reportedly turning its attention to Neiman Marcus, which it would like to buy minus its $5 billion in debt, according to the CNBC report. Neiman Marcus, which was purchased in 2013 by Ares Management and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, planned an initial public offering two years later to help pay down its $4.9 billion in debt, according to Reorg Research. But Neiman's owners formally withdrew its bid to go public in January, says Reorg.    More On: USA Today Neiman Marcus Hudson's Bay Company Macy's Inc Share this Article Join the Conversation Top Business Stories business & markets Charlie Baker rejects rail cuts matt stout business & markets Standard Life and Aberdeen agree on terms for merger associated press business & markets Officials say Green Line in need of fed, state money dan atkinson business & markets The Ticker herald staff Trending Now NFL: Tom Brady's jersey was stolen by international media member Robichaud: Why does AG need another $3M?

Forbes ranks Trump as the world’s 544th richest person, after coming in at No. 324 last year. He has famously refused to reveal his tax returns that would identify his actual net worth, but has claimed it’s “in excess” of $10 billion. Bill Gates now resides at the top of the list.

When it started the subscription service Amazon Prime, customers received two-day shipments for free. Each innovation caused a paradigm shift in how we shop and entertain ourselves.

Walmart has definitely taken aim. More than 65 million people were actively enrolled in Amazon Prime last year, paying $10.99 per month or $99 per year. Many customers use their accounts for free shipping, but they don’t realize that other terrific benefits exist as well. Here are nine Prime perks that you may not be using. Free same-day delivery It sounds too good to be true: You order an item, and someone hand-delivers the package within a few hours. How is this possible? Amazon Prime Now usually works like this. You can order a product by noon and expect to receive it by 9 p.m, sometimes even within an hour. It's only available in some cities and towns.  Learn more about same-day delivery. Share benefits with others There you were, enjoying the rewards of an Amazon Prime membership. Then you moved in with your significant other, who also orders a lot of stuff online. You can share the same Prime Membership with two other adults in the same household. To share your Amazon Prime membership, go to Account Settings >> Manage Your Content and Devices >> Settings >> Holds and Family Library >> Invite Adult. Tip in a Tip: Shopping on Amazon the right way is more than clicking items and loading up your cart. Once you learn a few tricks, you’ll find sales and price cuts that you never imagined possible. Watch streaming video Amazon Studios gained global attention at the 2017 Academy Awards when Casey Affleck won Best Actor for “Manchester by the Sea.” Like Netflix and Hulu, Amazon is producing a wide range of high-quality programs, and critics are giving the retail giant a big thumb’s up. However, Amazon also offers a colossal library of movies and TV series, from HBO flagships like “The Wire” to indie films like “The Lobster.” Keep in mind, not every flick or episode is available for free, but you can easily buy or order a streaming version of almost any movie imaginable. You can also download certain titles to watch offline. Here are the steps on how to do this. Download free music Many people enjoy their first year of Prime membership without ever knowing they can download music for free. That’s right: download. Yes, you can also stream songs, the same way you stream music on Apple Music, Spotify, and Pandora, but you can also choose from more than a million mp3s to keep forever on your phone or computer. The Prime Music app is also a handy tool. You can upload your own music library and listen to your songs wherever you go. Read free books and magazines Amazon started as an online bookstore, so it’s no wonder that the mega-store would nod to its roots with free volumes on Kindle. Amazon Prime reading offers you a trove of ebooks, comics, and magazines, which you can download at no charge to pretty much any device. The service works just like Prime Video, where the selections rotate regularly. So if the book you want to read isn’t there now, it maybe become available in a few months. Just download the Kindle app and you should ready to read. Verbophiles can even use the built-in dictionary to look up unfamiliar words. Use special cloud storage The truth is scary: Many people still don’t back up their hard drives. These folks are always one man-made or natural disaster away from losing all their pictures, music, videos, and documents. If you don’t already have a dependable storage service but you do have a Prime membership, you can use Amazon’s handy Cloud Drive, which gives members 5GB of storage for music and videos. Even better: You can use Amazon Prints to turn some of those stored photos into beautiful, frame-worthy images. Find out how to print high-quality photos for cheap. Order food and domestic goods Imagine walking into a supermarket, picking up a box, and filling it with 45 pounds of groceries. Okay, now imagine that you don’t even visit the supermarket, but someone deliveries this box directly to your door. Sound fantastic? Well, that’s basically what Amazon Pantry does. For $5.99, Amazon will ship a box of individual household items you select, up to 45 pounds. The service is still working out its kinks, so you won’t find the same selection you’d find at your local Super Target. But the idea is catching on, and many customers appreciate its versatility. Prime membership grants you access to a wider array of products. If you like the service, you can also subscribe to Amazon Family for $99, which gets you some extra perks, such as discounts on diapers. Get a discount on games Diehard gamers love to be the first to nab a new release. Amazon Prime members get a 20% discount on video game pre-orders and new releases. This applies to any game that has hit the market within two weeks of ordering. Just keep in mind that it only applies to physical copies of the game, and it doesn’t include console game bundles. Get restaurant meals delivered to your door Just when you thought DoorDash was a wild innovation, Amazon created its own dining delivery service: Just visit Amazon Restaurants and order a multi-course meal. Granted, you have to live in a city where Amazon Prime Now already exists. But if you do, you’re guaranteed to receive your steaming entrée within an hour!

After 41 years of operating Record Rack, owner Pat Strachota will be retiring this spring. "I thank my loyal customers for being such good customers over all the years," Strachota, 67, told The Commercial (http://bit.ly/2nsMBVj ). "They are the ones who made Record Rack Record Rack. ... I am going to hop on my motorcycle and ride. No destinations set. Just to see a sunset and a sunrise." Record Rack sells compact discs, cassette tapes, records, eight-tracks, Greek sorority and fraternity clothing, hookahs, biker gear, swimwear, black and strobe lights, skateboards, autographed guitars, e-cigarettes, lingerie, adult novelties, DVDs, spices, stones and candles. "I want to do what I want to do whenever I want to do it right now," Strachota said. "I live on a small farm. I've got a lot of work I need to do around there. My girlfriend has a lot of 'honey-do's' for me to do." He is looking for a buyer on a cash deal and has been hearing from one or two prospective buyers each week. He said he has no plans to finance such a transaction. In the meantime, he is offering sales and expects his regular customers to take advantage. If he does not sell his store, he expects to close by the end of April. "If I have a lot of stuff remaining, I may ask my landlord if I can stay until May," Strachota said. The advent of MP3 technology has impacted Record Rack, but not greatly because Strachota sells a broad assortment of merchandise. Besides the merchandise in the store, he has 17,000 DVDs in a warehouse on his farm. Vicki Hughes and her fiance David Green, both 48, have shopped and browsed at Record Rack for more than 30 years. Hughes smiled while recalling her shopping at the store "probably every pay day." "It's always been if you want to find really good music you're not going to find it at Walmart," Hughes said. "You're going to find it here. That's the norm. A lot of people my age come to Record Rack before they go to Walmart." Hughes hopes Strachota finds someone to buy his store. Green was shopping for a Kid Rock album and whatever else caught his eye. "It's sad because Record Rack has been here for a lot of years," Green said. "I hate to see it go because this has been a staple for as long as I can remember. I was born and raised here. There comes a time and a place you have to move on to other things." Alia Reeves shopped for Greek organization paraphernalia Wednesday and has been a customer since 1990. She is going to miss shopping at the store. "You can't find anything anywhere else except if you go out of town to Little Rock," Reeves, a Pine Bluff resident, said. "I like patronizing my own city. ... The Record Rack was the popping place for us as teenagers to get our records." Pat Strachota keeps a framed portrait of his late son U.S. Army Sgt. Michael Strachota inside his store.

LOUIS — A man found dead inside a burned home in southern Illinois had been shot in the head, and a gun was found in his ex-wife’s SUV after she drove into a nearby lake and died shortly after the fire was reported, authorities said Friday. The pair’s infant son was pulled from the submerged SUV by a paramedic who swam through frigid water, quickly realized a baby and not a doll was floating inside, and performed CPR on the boy atop the vehicle’s roof. Six other children safely escaped the Thursday fire at the house, where the divorced parents — who had a history of domestic violence — both lived. Preliminary autopsy results released Friday show 37-year-old Justin Campbell died from the gunshot wound. But testing can’t be done to determine whether the gun found in Cristy Campbell’s SUV was used to shoot Campbell because the bullet that struck him hasn’t been found, according to Madison County Coroner Steve Nonn. Nonn later told The Associated Press that nothing in the investigation or autopsy suggests the gunshot wound was self-inflected. Police said the tangled chain of events began when some of the children ran to a Walmart store near their home around 5:15 a.m. Thursday in Glen Carbon, Ill. They told an arriving worker to call 911 because their house was on fire. Responding firefighters found Justin Campbell’s body. About 16 minutes later, a motorist called 911 after seeing an SUV travel down a hill and into Silver Lake in Highland, about 16 miles away from the house. Paramedics Todd Zobrist and Ty Barr arrived minutes later. Zobrist said he could see headlights in the water and knew there might be someone inside the SUV, which was submerged in about five feet of water. He stripped off his shirt, socks and boots, and swam 75 feet to the vehicle. “When I got halfway there I was thoroughly thinking to myself, ’This is a terrible decision and I really need to just turn around and go back to the dock because I’m going to get myself in a lot of trouble,”’ Zobrist said at a news conference Friday. “At that point, though, I was committed, I was already wet, I was already cold.” Dark outside and difficult to see, he found the only access inside the vehicle was through an open driver’s side window. Zobrist peered into the back seat — and saw something. “It looked like two feet and two hands,” he said. “And at first I thought it was just a doll, a kid’s toy of some sort.” It was three-month-old Julian Campbell, alone and floating inside the SUV with about 8 inches of air space. Zobrist pulled the unresponsive infant out the window and began CPR on the SUV’s roof. Once the baby spit out water and began breathing, Zobrist, his muscles aching from the cold, called back to his partner to see if firefighters with a boat and wetsuits were coming. But the team was delayed by a train blocking access to the lake, so Zobrist swam back to shore with the baby in one arm. The baby was hospitalized and expected to recover. Zobrist, who has two young sons of his own, was treated for hypothermia in an emergency room but said he was fine. He shied away from any talk about his heroics. “It was just right place, right time,” he said. Cristy Campbell’s body was found hours later in the lake. Preliminary autopsy results determined she died of “environmental exposure and drowning,” Nonn said. The Illinois State Fire Marshal’s office is investigating the cause of the fire. The Campbells had a volatile history but were living together with their children, said Capt. Mike Dixon of the Madison County Sheriff’s Department. Before they married, Justin Campbell was charged with domestic abuse in 2005. He was accused of attacking Cristy Campbell, known then as Cristy Brueggemann, when she was pregnant by slapping her in the head. He was sentenced in March 2006 to probation and fined $500. Despite the violence, they wed on Nov. 3, 2006. She filed for legal separation in September 2010, but the matter was dismissed two months later. In April 2012, Cristy Campbell obtained an emergency protection order against her husband and filed for divorce. She alleged in court papers that he “abuses me on a weekly basis,” including punching and choking her. “He has told me that I’m a no good wife,” Campbell wrote in her application for the protection order. The divorce was granted in February 2013. Glen Carbon police have answered around 50 calls to the Campbell home, including some “domestic-related situations,” Madison County Sheriff John Lakin said. He declined to elaborate. Authorities said the children are with Illinois authorities and will be placed with relatives. Associated Press writer Jim Suhr in Kansas City, Missouri, contributed to this report.

There was a time, maybe not so long ago, that being Irish wasn't something to brag about — not even on St. Patrick's Day. But, I'm not here to get involved in that subject, no, to the contrary, I want to tell you of my attempts to be lucky. I have had a few bright spots, i.e. one afternoon, while walking home from our rural schoolhouse in Reno, Nevada, I nearly tripped over a little red coin purse someone had dropped. There were a few coins inside, probably less than a dollar's worth, and nothing else. I had just stumbled upon a windfall. As has become my habit when given free money, I spent it. Well, there wasn't a nearby Wal-Mart, just an old gas station, with its limited supply of desirables. Unless I craved a radiator hose for a 1937 Cord, about all they had was a Coke machine. I trudged home with a half dozen bottles of Coke. A 6-year-old with a six-pack. Lady Luck smiled. It wasn't too long after, that my older brother Lowell and I were walking to the bus stop when I spotted a wad of bills. My intolerably honest brother insisted we turn the trove in at a nearby roadside store. "Someone may have lost it," said my brother. "Really?" said I. Advertisement He took the cash and handed it in to a clerk, who happily mumbled something to the effect that he would "make every attempt to return it to its rightful owner." Then he stuffed it into his pocket. Lady Luck frowned. Moving ahead a couple of years, and our family found ourselves in another Emerald Isle — the very green, Douglas Island, Alaska. My mom's best friend lived a few blocks from us, in an apartment house that was next to a vacant lot that abutted a busy bar. The sidewalk in front of the buildings was raised maybe 4 feet from the level of the lot. I'm sure a few bar patrons had discovered the drop-off when toddling unsteadily out of the bar, and found themselves briefly airborne. Anyway, I was playing in the lot (playing in bars came a few years later) and noticed something green in one of the cracks on the sidewalk's retaining wall. A closer look revealed that the green I saw was a $20 bill! In those days that could represent a week's work. I raced home, and showed my mom my treasure. Lady Luck smiled. On a Saturday morning during that same time frame, my best friend Ray and I had cajoled enough money from our moms to go to the Saturday matinee at Juneau's movie theater. That was a big deal. They had drawings each week before the movie started for some nice prizes; that particular week, a new bicycle. I didn't bicycle, mud streets weren't conducive to such pursuits — but who could argue with a free bike? Well, to save the suspense, when the drawing was held, the number was read — and I had every number on my ticket — but the last one. Lady Luck frowned. It was a girl's bike anyway.

Calling itself Altamont Main Street USA, the group sent the letter March 4, targeting the National Enquirer, the Globe, the National Examiner and other such publications. They were sent to Price Chopper, Hannaford, ShopRite, Cumberland Farms, Rite Aid, CVS, Wal-Mart and Target. "We'd like those publications to be moved," said Amy Bloch of Albany, a member of the group. "We don't think people should have to see news that is political and that isn't real. We just feel it should be moved to another part of the store. They can sell what they want but people shouldn't have to see them." Bloch said the letter isn't meant to be partisan, because the tabloids have written negative, false stories about both Republican and Democratic elected officials and candidates. "People can vote on the left or the right but they shouldn't be misled by news that is demonstrably wrong," she said. In its letter, the group cites a string of National Enquirer stories. Those include an April 2016 headline claiming Sen. Ted Cruz's father was involved in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy as well as a series of negative articles claiming Hillary Clinton was about to be caught in a sex scandal, that she only had six months to live, and that she was going to jail. This week's headlines include the Globe's "Clinton Secret Payoff Files!" and the National Enquirer's "Proof Obama Wiretapped Trump!" Mona Golub, spokeswoman for Price Chopper and Market 32, said the supermarket appreciates the feedback but it carries thousands of products in its stores. "The criteria by which any of them are judged, purchased or consumed are at the discretion of our customer," she said. Castina Charles of Schenectady, lead organizer for the citizen group, was more partisan in her comments than Bloch. She described the group as an outgrowth from MoveOn.org, people who met through the left-leaning website. She said there were 40 members on the group's email list, 20 of them active. "Our stated aim is to resist the negative impacts the Trump administration and the Republican Party have had," she said. She said the first goal all the group's members agreed on was that the supermarket tabloids should be moved because their headlines are usually false. "We are all shoppers. We all go to Price Chopper. We all go to Hannaford," she said. "This is an action we're taking as a group, trying to address corporate responsibility." President Donald Trump's relation to Enquirer chief executive David Pecker has been described by multiple news organizations as close, and the president has written articles for the publication. While most politicians are subject to gossip, Trump routinely draws the Enquirer's glowing praise. Last week's headline had a photo of Trump proclaiming "How I'm Cleaning Up Obama's Mess." Even a seemingly scandalous headline promoting "The Secret Psych Evaluation!" of the president concluded: "Natural-born leader Donald Trump is a highly focused, driven and charismatic genius who thinks outside the box — and is almost too smart for his own good!" James Calvin, president of the New York Association of Convenience Stores, said customers can make their own decisions. "I'd like to think that consumers are smart enough to determine for themselves what is accurate and truthful reporting and what isn't," he said. "I prefer to leave that to the news consumer to determine." tobrien@timesunion.com • 518-454-5092 • @timobrientu News Videos Most Popular 1 Troy police officer crashed into a Colonie police van 2 Woman cuffed and slammed in Schenectady police station 3 20-mile chase ends in Schodack, police said 4 A promise of suicide before fatal crash in Rotterdam 5 A.M.

(Laurie Skrivan/St. Louis Post-Dispatch via AP) ST. LOUIS (AP) — A man found dead inside a burned home in southern Illinois had been shot in the head, and a gun was found in his ex-wife's SUV after she drove into a nearby lake and died shortly after the fire was reported, authorities said Friday. The pair's infant son was pulled from the submerged SUV by a paramedic who swam through frigid water, quickly realized a baby and not a doll was floating inside, and performed CPR on the boy atop the vehicle's roof. Six other children safely escaped the Thursday fire at the house, where the divorced parents — who had a history of domestic violence — both lived. Preliminary autopsy results released Friday show 37-year-old Justin Campbell died from the gunshot wound. But testing can't be done to determine whether the gun found in Cristy Campbell's SUV was used to shoot Campbell because the bullet that struck him hasn't been found, according to Madison County Coroner Steve Nonn. Nonn later told The Associated Press that nothing in the investigation or autopsy suggests the gunshot wound was self-inflected. Police said the tangled chain of events began when some of the children ran to a Wal-Mart store near their home around 5:15 a.m. Thursday in Glen Carbon, Illinois. They told an arriving worker to call 911 because their house was on fire. Responding firefighters found Justin Campbell's body. About 16 minutes later, a motorist called 911 after seeing an SUV travel down a hill and into Silver Lake in Highland, about 16 miles away from the house. Paramedics Todd Zobrist and Ty Barr arrived minutes later. Zobrist said he could see headlights in the water and knew there might be someone inside the SUV, which was submerged in about 5 feet of water. He stripped off his shirt, socks and boots, and swam 75 feet to the vehicle. "When I got halfway there I was thoroughly thinking to myself, 'This is a terrible decision and I really need to just turn around and go back to the dock because I'm going to get myself in a lot of trouble,'" Zobrist said at a news conference Friday. "At that point, though, I was committed, I was already wet, I was already cold." Dark outside and difficult to see, he found the only access inside the vehicle was through an open driver's side window. Zobrist peered into the back seat — and saw something. "It looked like two feet and two hands," he said. "And at first I thought it was just a doll, a kid's toy of some sort." It was 3-month-old Julian Campbell, alone and floating inside the SUV with about 8 inches of air space. Zobrist pulled the unresponsive infant out the window and began CPR on the SUV's roof. Once the baby spit out water and began breathing, Zobrist, his muscles aching from the cold, called back to his partner to see if firefighters with a boat and wetsuits were coming. But the team was delayed by a train blocking access to the lake, so Zobrist swam back to shore with the baby in one arm. The baby was hospitalized and expected to recover. Zobrist, who has two young sons of his own, was treated for hypothermia in an emergency room but said he was fine. He shied away from any talk about his heroics. "It was just right place, right time," he said. Cristy Campbell's body was found hours later in the lake. Preliminary autopsy results determined she died of "environmental exposure and drowning," Nonn said. The Illinois State Fire Marshal's office is investigating the cause of the fire. The Campbells had a volatile history but were living together with their children, said Capt. Mike Dixon of the Madison County Sheriff's Department. Before they married, Justin Campbell was charged with domestic abuse in 2005. He was accused of attacking Cristy Campbell, known then as Cristy Brueggemann, when she was pregnant by slapping her in the head. He was sentenced in March 2006 to probation and fined $500. Despite the violence, they wed on Nov. 3, 2006. She filed for legal separation in September 2010, but the matter was dismissed two months later. In April 2012, Cristy Campbell obtained an emergency protection order against her husband and filed for divorce. She alleged in court papers that he "abuses me on a weekly basis," including punching and choking her. "He has told me that I'm a no good wife," Campbell wrote in her application for the protection order. The divorce was granted in February 2013. Glen Carbon police have answered around 50 calls to the Campbell home, including some "domestic-related situations," Madison County Sheriff John Lakin said. He declined to elaborate. Authorities said the children are with Illinois authorities and will be placed with relatives. ___ Associated Press writer Jim Suhr in Kansas City, Missouri, contributed to this report.

A Dun & Bradstreet database, 52 GB in size and containing more than 33.6 million records with very specific details, has been exposed. Cybersecurity researcher Troy Hunt, who received the database for study, on Wednesday confirmed that the records already were organized and developed as if intended for distribution to a potential client. The database belonged to NetProspex, a firm purchased by Dun & Bradstreet in 2015 for US$125 million, ZDNet confirmed. NetProspex had compiled the database -- which included personal information including names, job titles, job responsibilities and work email addresses and phone numbers -- for e-marketers, by all accounts. It presumably was meant as a tool to target customers via email campaigns and other communication methods. It is the type of data that can be purchased by clients and broken down either via bulk email addresses, or by specific records such as by company or industry. No highly sensitive personal information was included in the records, however, according to Dun & Bradstreet. "Based on our analysis, it is our determination that there has been no exposure of sensitive personal information from, and no infiltration of, our system," a Dun & Bradstreet spokesperson said in a statement provided to the E-Commerce Times by company rep Deborah McBridge. "The information in question is data typically found on a business card," the spokesperson added. "As general practice, Dun & Bradstreet uses an agile security process and evaluates and evolves security controls to protect the integrity of our data. Generally, our legal agreements do require our customers to safeguard and maintain the confidentiality of the data they receive." <a href="//us-ads.openx.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=45628437ae&amp;cb=14900840089077" ><img src="//us-ads.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=538762537&amp;cs=45628437ae&amp;cb=14900840089077" border="0" alt="" /></a> Devil in the Details The database includes information only on Americans, Hunt found. California has the highest representation with more than 4 million records, followed by New York with 2.7 million, and Texas with 2.6 million records. That is in line with the population breakdown of the United States in general. The database is quite diverse, including information on organizations in the government and military sectors, as well as individuals in the commercial sector. The database includes details on more than 100,000 individuals working for the Department of Defense, and more than 88,000 employee records from the United States Postal Service. There are more than 76,000 records from the United States Army and United States Air Force combined. On the corporate side, the database includes records from several large-scale businesses, including AT&T, Boeing, Dell, FedEx, IBM and Xerox, as well as Walmart, CVS Health Corporation, Wells Fargo Bank, Citigroup and Kaiser Foundation Hospitals. Ohio State University is one of the centers of higher education listed by Hunt, with 38,705 of its employee records turning up in the database. Digital Commodity How the information was stolen isn't yet clear, but it doesn't appear that great sophistication was required, which is in itself worrisome. "The D&B breach shines an uncomfortable light on a common fact of modern life -- that companies of most every sort consider personal customer information to be a valuable commodity," said Charles King, principal analyst at Pund-IT. "Once consumers provide information to businesses and other organizations, they have virtually no control over how it is handled, and few options when it is mishandled," he told the E-Commerce Times. "This hack shows that these types of databases are the low-hanging fruit for hackers," said Pierre Roberge, chairman of Arc4dia. "This wasn't a very technical hack, and there probably isn't a lot of money that will be made from it, but for some hackers this is enough so that they can eat and live," he told the E-Commerce Times. Going Into Crisis Mode Companies have been challenged to come up with effective responses to data breaches, cyberattacks and other hacks. "Organizations that have been hacked or breached would do well to address the situation with full transparency," noted King. "In fact, Yahoo's situation is an exemplar of the bad tidings that can occur for a company and its shareholders when lack of transparency is the rule," he told the E-Commerce Times. "Though Dun & Bradstreet insisted that no personally identifiable information was exposed, reports that the database includes people's first and last names, their job titles, email addresses, and the organizations they work for suggests otherwise," King said. "The company would do well to get out in front of this or risk suffering long-term damage. " Threat Level Compared to recent cyberattacks and security breaches, this leak could rank more as an annoyance than as a grave security concern. "This isn't voter data rolls, or very personal information such as what we saw in the Office of Personnel Management or healthcare breaches," said Eric Hodge, director of consulting at security research firm CyberScout. "However, it could be a great first step for identity theft," he told the E-Commerce Times. "The information can make it more convenient for criminals, but this information is already out there and could be picked off LinkedIn or Facebook," added Hodge. "The bigger worry from this is that it casts a light on the global state of cybersecurity," observed Arc4dia's Roberge. "It might not be very sensitive, but it shouldn't end up on the black market so easily," he said. Follow-Up Attacks Identity theft is the biggest potential concern resulting from an attack like this one, but unlike the OPM breach, which included Social Security numbers, home addresses, and in many cases fingerprints, the information leaked here is less significant on a personal level. "This is in the 'oh great, I'm going to get more spam' -- but anyone who thinks their information was breached should be more aware," cautioned Hodge. "I'd suggest checking credit card bills more closely, checking credit scores, and generally being vigilant," he said, even though "this isn't the type of breach that should be cause for huge alarm." Still, enterprising hackers could use corporate email addresses in dangerous ways. "The challenge with a breach of this nature is that it provides a lot of raw material for nefarious attackers to craft very convincing phishing or social engineering campaigns against decision-makers in corporations," said Dwayne Melancon, vice president of products at security and compliance firm Tripwire . "Organizations should warn executives," he told the E-CommerceTimes, "and educate them on the warning signs of business email compromise schemes." Mind of the Marketer The thieves apparently meant to sell the database to unscrupulous marketers. "This does cast the spotlight inside the seamy underbelly of what you agree with when you check on agreements to use your personal information," noted CyberScout's Hodge. "This information is what is considered acceptable to share when you check the box on agreements without reading the fine print," he added. "It will open the eyes to what you give in the way of information to reputable companies, and this is good illustration of the reality of how this information is then shared."

A young dark-haired police officer was talking with a little boy sitting in his parents’ store cart. The officer was bending down, making eye contact with the boy. He asked him if he had a dog or a cat, and he swore in the boy in as an honorary police officer and asked him to love his mom and dad, and to always be kind to his pets. I’m sure that officer was life-changing for that little boy. Remember, friends, that officer represents 99.99 percent of our men and women in blue. When you see a cop and you get a touch of the old black and white fever, remember this: They are on our side, folks.

Jim Cramer rang the lightning round bell, which means he gave his take on caller favorite stocks at rapid speed: Target: "It's going down. Target is in the crosshairs, it's in the crosshairs of Wal-Mart and Amazon and Dollar General, for that matter. Kind of a bad place to be. They've got to reconfigure, they've got to bring back the excitement, and I don't know how they do that, but then again, I'm not the CEO, so I don't have to worry." Gilead Sciences: "I've got to tell you, it's always tempting, but they need to make an acquisition. I've been saying this over and over again, and if they came on the show, I'd say it too. Without an acquisition, it's just a value trap." Novo Nordisk: "We didn't include it because it has very little growth, and … [Eli] Lilly is just a much better growth company than Novo, and … remember, there's a lot of political pressure on Novo. But not on Lilly. Aurinia Pharmaceuticals: "This thing has had too much of a move. It's got to cool off. I've been watching it. Too crazed." Barracuda Networks: "I follow them on Twitter. You know, they're some very smart guys. They do a lot of stuff that I like. They do networking, content security, and I will bless it. Yeah, I think it's good. I mean, look, these things can have shortfalls. But I like this company." STMicroelectronics NV: "Yes. You know what, I've been trying to profile the ones that people don't talk about. That's a very good one, STMicro. I like it. Do I like it as much as NVIDIA? No. Do I like it as much as AMD? No. But it's good. One called asked if Nokia could come back: "No." Tellurian: "No, no double down, no double down, but I do like it because of Shari Souki, and he's got 15 percent of the company, and we want to be with Shari for the side-by-side, but let's not go crazy." Citrix Systems: "You know, it had that run because people said it was going to be taking over, and then it wasn't taking over. I don't know, I feel like they stole from the upside. I would not want to come in at this level." Voya Financial: "No, I like Voya. That's a good one. I mean, kind of boring, kind of a little paint dry there, but I think it's an OK situation." Delta Air Lines: "Well, you stop wondering, start buying. I mean, Delta's inexpensive, I like the business. I think the quarter's going to be weak, but the year's going to be good. DAL, it's got a big thumbs up from me." Community Health Systems: "Inexpensive, but not my cup of tea, particularly with 'repeal and replace.' I want to repeal and replace that stock with UnitedHealth." Questions for Cramer? Call Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBC Want to take a deep dive into Cramer's world? Hit him up!

Their father, Justin Campbell, was shot and killed in their Glen Carbon residence. The home was later set ablaze with the children still inside. All managed to escape the home. The youngest of the children, a three-month-old boy, survived different ordeal. He was in the SUV when his mother, Cristy Campbell, crashed the vehicle into Silver Lake in Highland. Campbell drowned, but the infant was pulled to safety by two paramedics. The Highland Fire Chief said after giving the first responders time to decompress and recover from the circumstances of Thursday’s tragic events, the first responders wanted to express their sympathies for the children and other family members involved. The fire broke out early Thursday morning on Dogwood Lane in Glen Carbon. Firefighters discovered the body of 37-year-old Justin Campbell inside the home. He’d been shot in the head. When the fire broke out, his children ran to a nearby Walmart for help. Meanwhile, Cristy Campbell drove away from the scene in an SUV with her three-month-old son. Two Highland paramedics, 31-year-old Todd Zobrist and 35-year-old Ty Barr, rescued the baby. As the community calls them heroes, both said they were saddened after learning Cristy Campbell's body was later discovered in the lake. “Who was going to go? … I said, ‘I go,’ I took my shirt and sweat shirt off, boots and socks, and jumped in. I made the determination,” Zobrist said. “I swam about 75 feet and got on top of the roof of the vehicle and saw the driver’s side window was not intact.” Zobrist found the baby floating in the SUV with about six to eight inches of airspace. “What I saw in front of me was two feet and two hands. (I) thought it was a doll or a toy. I reached back as far as I could and it was a person,” Zobrist said. The baby was lifeless when Zobrist pulled him from the SUV. The paramedic placed the baby on the roof of the SUV and began to administer CPR. Zobrist said the baby began spitting up water after a few breaths. After a few breaths started spitting up some water and rolled on side and gave more breaths “Once he came out with a baby, my concern came to that baby,” said Ty Barr. “I saw Todd doing chest compressions and I knew Todd started to struggle. The distance; the swim.” Zobrist decided he could do more for the child on land, so he got into the water and swam to the shore on his back, all while holding the baby above his head. 38.739492 -89.671201 Filed in: News Topics: highland, illinois news, rescue, silver lake, todd zobrist, ty barr Suggest a correction × Suggest A Correction Your name Your email Report a typo or grammatical error Cancel Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest LinkedIn Email STL Moms!

LOUIS -- The paramedic who swam into a southern Illinois lake to save a baby says he briefly questioned his decision to jump into the frigid water, but is glad he did. "That water was cold, and the car was out a distance. I got halfway out and realized that it was horrible decision. But then I said I had committed to this so I continued," he said. Paramedic Todd Zobrist spoke at a news conference on Friday, a day after jumping into 46-degree water at Silver Lake near St. Louis and saving 3-month-old Julian Campbell. Zobrist says he swam about 75 feet and thought a doll was floating inside the SUV, but realized he was holding a baby by the arm when he reached inside the vehicle. Zobrist performed CPR on the roof of the SUV, then swam the infant to shore. The baby is expected to survive. Authorities say the boy's mother was driving the SUV that plunged into the lake Thursday morning, about 15 minutes after a fatal fire erupted at the family's nearby home. The mother, 32-year-old Cristy Lynn Campbell, was found dead in the lake hours later. The coroner in Madison County, Illinois, released the information Friday as investigators try to untangle the events that preceded the death of 32-year-old Cristy Lynn Campbell. A fire broke out at her home around 5:15 a.m. Thursday in nearby Glen Carbon, Illinois. Six siblings, ranging up to age 14, escaped, but an adult died. Coroner Steve Nonn says an autopsy will be conducted to positively identify the person killed in the fire. Campbell's ex-husband and the father of the children, 37-year-old Justin Campbell, is unaccounted for. About 15 minutes later, an SUV was spotted driving into Silver Lake, about 16 miles away in Highland, Illinois. Madison County Sheriff John Lakin says a motorist called 911 Thursday morning to report a car heading down a hill toward Silver Lake. Highland Emergency Medical Services chief Brian Wilson called Zobrist's actions heroic. "He definitely saved the child's life," Wilson said. "It was definitely good news for the family - especially with all the bad news - that all the children are safe," Zobrist said. "I'm ready to go back to my normal shift and have things to go back to normal." Some of the children ran to a nearby Wal-Mart, others to a home in the neighborhood. The kids at the Wal-Mart asked an arriving worker to call 911, Lakin said. Cristy Campbell was not in the home when firefighters arrived nor was the couple's seventh child, 3-month-old Julian. The child, initially unresponsive, is expected to recover and could be released Friday from a hospital in St. Charles, Missouri, Lakin said. "Today was a tragic day all the way around because of both scenes," Lakin said. "Fortunately, there is something good that can come of this." After finding the baby, authorities began searching the water. A body was pulled from the lake around 11:15 a.m.. Court records showed that Cristy Campbell and Justin Campbell, 37, had a volatile relationship. In 2005, before they were married, Justin Campbell was charged with domestic abuse for allegedly attacking Cristy Campbell, then known as Cristy Brueggemann, by slapping her in the head when she was pregnant. He was sentenced in March 2006 to probation and fined $500. Despite the violence, they wed on Nov. 3, 2006. She filed for legal separation in September of 2010, but the matter was dismissed two months later. In April of 2012, Cristy Campbell obtained an emergency protection order against her husband and filed for divorce, alleging in court papers that he "abuses me on a weekly basis," including punching and choking her. "He has told me that I'm a no good wife," Campbell wrote in her application for the protection order. The divorce was granted in February 2013. Lakin said Glen Carbon police have answered several calls to Campbell's home, including some "domestic-related situations," but he declined to elaborate. "The Glen Carbon Police Department was aware of that house," Lakin said. Authorities said the children are with Illinois authorities and will be placed with relatives. Glen Carbon is about 30 miles east of St. Louis. AP - ABC News contributed to this report.

Campbell died after driving her SUV into a lake and her ex-husband, Justin Campbell, was found shot to death in the house. GLEN CARBON, Ill. A “person of interest” in a house fire that endangered six of her children was pulled dead from a submerged SUV Thursday, after a dramatic rescue of the woman’s 3-month-old son from the icy waters.  Cristy Lynn Campbell, 32, of Glen Carbon, Illinois, is also suspected of killing her ex-husband, Justin Campbell, before setting the fire. The 37-year-old father of her seven children was identified Friday as the man who was found dead in the family’s fire-gutted house, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported.  Justin Campbell died of a gunshot wound to the head, according to the Madison County coroner.  Cristy Campbell died of exposure and drowning after she drove her SUV into Silver Lake near Highland, about 16 miles east of her home, where the house fire was reported, the Post-Dispatch reported.  An EMT was hailed as a hero after swimming into the lake and rescuing the couple’s infant son, who he found floating inside the sinking vehicle. Paramedic Todd Zobrist pulled the boy’s lifeless body out of the SUV and used the roof of the vehicle as a surface to perform CPR.  The baby was taken to a St. Louis hospital for treatment, and he was expected to be released Friday after making a full recovery, ABC News said. Madison County Sheriff John Lakin credited Zobrist with saving the infant’s life. “Fortunately, there is something good that can come of this,” Lakin told the Post-Dispatch.  The baby and his six siblings, four boys and two girls ranging in age from 4 to 14, were placed in the care of family members. Community organizations have begun to collect donations of clothing, shoes and toys, as well as monetary donations to help the children replenish what they lost in the fire, the Post-Dispatch reported.  Volunteers are also considering starting a college fund for the children.  The family tragedy began around 5:15 a.m. Thursday when a 911 caller reported a fire at Campbell’s home. Though the six older children escaped the flames and ran to a nearby Walmart for help, Justin Campbell’s body was found in the house after the fire had been extinguished, the Post-Dispatch reported.  KTVI in St. Louis reported Thursday morning that Cristy Campbell was named a “person of interest” in the fire, and that authorities were searching for her. At the same time, the news station reported the SUV going into the lake just before 6 a.m. It was initially unclear if the two deadly incidents were related. The connection was confirmed when Campbell’s ID was found in the SUV, listing the address of the burned house as her home address, KMOV in St. Louis reported.  A gun was also found in the vehicle, the Post-Dispatch said.  Campbell’s body, which was found about 400 feet from the SUV, was pulled from the lake around 11:15 a.m. Thursday.  The Post-Dispatch reported that security camera footage from a neighbor’s home on Dogwood Lane showed an SUV leaving the Campbell home just before 5 a.m. The video, obtained by the newspaper and posted online, showed the headlights coming on around 4:50 a.m. and, after several minutes, the SUV backing out of the driveway. Some of the children could be seen in the grainy footage, chasing the vehicle as it drove away. About three minutes later, light from the flames could be seen lighting up the side of a neighboring house. Four of the children, the smallest carrying what looked like a blanket, were seen fleeing past the camera in the direction of Walmart, where they sought help.  Cristy Campbell’s Facebook page is filled with photos of her children and kudos for their accomplishments at school. Her profile photo shows her swimming with a dolphin. A neighbor, who said she believed that Justin Campbell was living with his ex-wife and children, told the Post-Dispatch that the children were always busy with a variety of activities that earned them awards and trophies that filled their home.  The neighbor, Sherry Ricker, told the newspaper that she saw Cristy Campbell and held her infant son just three days earlier. “She was happier than I had seen her in a long time,” Ricker said.  Authorities on Friday were still piecing together the timeline of events in the case, but the Post-Dispatch reported that court records show a long history of problems in the Campbells’ relationship, including before their 2006 marriage. Justin Campbell was charged with domestic abuse in 2005, when his then-girlfriend was pregnant with the couple’s third child.  Cristy Campbell filed for divorce in 2010, but later changed her mind. She filed again in 2012, alleging that her husband was physically abusive. She was granted a protection order against him, but later asked to have it withdrawn.  She was awarded custody of the children when the divorce was finalized later that year, the Post-Dispatch reported. Two years later, she requested that Justin Campbell have supervised visitation after two of the children accused their father of pinching, hitting and choking them.  Cristy Campbell was cited by police three months later for allowing her 5-year-old to leave the house and “wander around the streets of Glen Carbon unattended,” the newspaper reported. She was allowed to take parenting classes in exchange for the charges being dropped.  View Comments 0 Sign up for e-newsletters Want more news?

Mandatory Credit: Kim Klement-USA TODAY Sports Fantasy Football 2017: Do Not Sleep on Kenny Britt by Daniel Thomas NFL Free Agency March Madness: Top Players Available Ranked by Dan Salem New York Jets New York Jets: Bradley McDougald Would Be a Smart Signing by Stephen Smith3 days agoFollow @stevesmithNYJ Tweet Share x GPlus Pin Comment Still quiet in 2017 NFL free agency, the New York Jets would be wise to pursue and attempt to sign safety Bradley McDougald The New York Jets have certainly not been dynamic players in NFL free agency so far. Quite the contrary. It feels like the Jets are shopping at Walmart, looking for bargains, while other NFL teams have been doing their shopping at Lord & Taylor. Mike Maccagnan and the Jets are taking the right approach, though—rebuilding with youth via the draft, while aiming to make smart, pragmatic free agent signings. New York needs to do just that and ink free agent safety Bradley McDougald to help boost their struggling secondary. Gang Green ranked 17th in the league last season against the pass, allowing 244 yards per game. Safeties Calvin Pryor and Marcus Gilchrist suffered through mediocre seasons so McDougald would provide an instant upgrade while not putting much of a dent in New York’s salary cap.

The Seattle Seahawks met with McDougald on Wednesday, so New York will have competition for his services. He’d be worth it, though. McDougald is still in his prime at 26 years of age and is coming off an excellent campaign with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He ranked second on the squad with 91 tackles while adding two interceptions, a fumble recovery and 10 passes defended. He is known as a strong tackler and is dependable as well. Over the last two seasons, McDougald has started in 31 of Tampa Bay’s 32 contests. Over his short career, the Dublin, OH native has registered five interceptions and 21 passes defended. The Jets have dipped their toe in the free agent pool recently by signing cornerback Morris Claiborne and left tackle Kelvin Beachum—both solid moves but certainly nothing to throw a parade over. This team is simply not going to make any glamour signings in free agency. The big ticket players have already signed elsewhere. And that’s okay. Next: Jets No Longer A Preferred Free Agency Destination However, bringing McDougald onboard would strengthen their defensive backfield and not cost them an arm and a leg. It would continue their process of building with youth and would provide Gang Green with some quality depth in their secondary.

Friday, March 17, 2017 at 4:21PM On March 12, 2017, Anderson County deputies responded to a robbery call at the Walmart on Hwy 153 in Powdersville. While a mother and daughter were selling Girl Scout Cookies at a table in front of the store, an unknown black female grabbed the money box from the seller’s table and attempted to flee. In an attempt to retrieve her money box, the seller was punched and kicked to the ground receiving minor injuries.  The female subject did get into a black Jeep Grand Cherokee driven by another female subject and left the parking lot turning right headed towards Greenville.  The subject is described as wearing a black sweatshirt and dark jeans with black spikey Mohawk style blue tipped hair. The photos are not sharp, but here they are. Anyone with information regarding this incident or the identification of this individual are asked to contact the Anderson County Sheriff’s Office at 864-260-4400.

The company declined to specify the price on the deal that closed Friday, saying only that it was in the same range as its previous two purchases of online businesses. Those were $51 million and $70 million. Wal-Mart is working hard to attract younger and more affluent shoppers, but winning over ModCloth's devoted customers, fans of its vintage-inspired patterned dresses, inclusive sizing and community feel, may be a challenge. Many expressed their disappointment on social media when they heard talk of a deal with Wal-Mart. Bentonville, Arkansas-based Wal-Mart said ModCloth will continue to operate as a stand-alone and complementary brand to its other e-commerce sites, and will bring experience and talent to strengthening the company's fashion business aimed at millennials. Independent designers who sell on ModCloth's site, it said, will gain the opportunity to expand their reach. ModCloth CEO Matthew Kaness, his executive team and the company's 300-plus employees will stay based in San Francisco, Los Angeles and Pittsburgh, and will join Wal-Mart's U.S. e-commerce retail organization. Wal-Mart spent more than $3 billion for upstart Jet.com last year and since then has purchased other smaller companies, including online footwear retailer ShoeBuy.com and the outdoor gear seller Moosejaw. Marc Lore, the founder of Jet.com who is now CEO of Walmart.com, said last month that the company was still looking for new startups to buy. ModCloth, founded in 2002, has one physical store in Austin, Texas.

Andrew Samborski, 21, of 29 Cherry Hill Road was charged with carrying a dangerous weapon, second-degree threatening, two counts of risk of injury to a minor, breach of peace, second-degree reckless endangerment, evading responsibility, throwing objects at a motor vehicle, unsafe passing and unsafe backing. According to Lt. Corey Poore, Samborski backed his car into another vehicle in or near the parking lot of the Wal-Mart at 220 Salem Turnpike. Poore said Samborski then left the scene and headed toward his house. When the vehicle Samborski allegedly hit began to follow him, Poore said, Samborski threw objects at it. Samborski and the other vehicle continued to Samborski’s house, where Samborski went inside and came back out twice — first to grab a knife, then a shotgun, according to Poore. Poore said police were called when Samborski came out with the shotgun, which he never ended up firing. Several officers went to the scene, Poore said. Samborski’s risk of injury to a minor charges stem from the fact that two children were in the other vehicle, Poore said. Samborski’s passenger, Alexis Morrison, 18, also of 29 Cherry Hill Road, also was charged with breach of peace for allegedly getting out of the vehicle she was in and trying to start a fight with the other car’s occupants. Information about their court dates wasn’t immediately available. l.boyle@theday.com Previous Article Next Article Loading comment count... Commenting is closed.

Scott Harvey / KSMU Springfield’s City Council candidates for Zone 2 offered similar views on many issues such as the budget, economic development options and public safety resources during a forum Thursday. Dr. Thomas Prater, Incumbent Zone 2 Councilman, is seeking to retain the seat he was appointed to in September 2016. He’s challenged by Helen Gunther. The event, held at Evangel University, marked the third of four town-hall style forums presented by the Springfield News-Leader this month. Zone 2 is bordered by the city limits to the north and east, and generally National Avenue and Sunshine Street to the west and south. Background Prater, the Zone 2 incumbent, is a graduate of Glendale High School in Springfield, received a bachelor of science degree from Southern Methodist University, and his doctorate from Washington University. Prater is an eye surgeon with Mattax Neu Prater Eye Center in Springfield. He’s previously served on the boards of the Springfield Area Chamber of Commerce and Community Foundation of the Ozarks, as well as on the Springfield Public Schools board for six years, including two of those as its president. Gunther is a graduate of Hillcrest High School in Springfield with some college level study. She currently serves as a real estate agent with Murney Associates. She’s owned a series of small businesses, including a tanning salon, car lot and floral shop. Volunteer work has come through the American Heart Association, YMCA, Court Appointed Special Advocates and her church. Public Safety Like in last week’s Zone 1 forum, both candidates on Thursday were asked what repercussions, if any, should be taken against Springfield Police Chief Paul Williams. This after a jury awarded $30,000 to a police officer who had sued saying the department failed to promote him because he is Hispanic. The question, as it did the week before, came from citizen Tim Haven. For Gunther, the answer was no. “I think that he should be reprimanded, yes. And if there is an issue again – fired. I think that everybody deserves a second chance.” Prater said the decision is not his to make, saying it is the City Council’s job to determine if the city manager is adequately addressing the issue. “If the council is displeased with the way the city manager is managing his team, which includes the police chief, and the fire chief, the environmental services director, budget manager and all this kind of stuff, then the city council needs to take action through the city manager to fix the problem.” Asked by Havens if Prater is displeased with the city manager’s performance on the issue, the Zone 2 candidate stopped short of answering. “I’m not going to get into the weeds and critique the city manager’s management of the police chief. That’s not my job.” Other questions on public safety ranged from the frequency of times officers are dispatched to Walmart and various retails stores, to the department’s budget. Gunther brought up staffing, and the need to keep who they hire. “In 2017 we had 10 people graduate [from the academy.] And that’s fantastic. But keeping in mind that it costs $100,000 to train a police officer in six months then we have to realize that is a very expensive investment. We have to keep ‘em.” That requires a fair wage, she says. If a police officer is quick to leave after going through training, it is a big financial loss to the city. Prater says spending on police in the current year is more than $3 million over the previous year, but more resources are needed despite what may be a tough budget year ahead. “So I think council has to pay attention to that. I think some carry-over funds will be used for equipment. The ladder truck [for the Fire Department] is one, some replacement police cars is one.” Prater notes while the police chief has authorization to hire more officers the budget is limited and recruiting is hampered by low wages when compared with St. Louis and Kansas City. He believes there could be room in the budget to cut waste and apply toward public safety. Poverty The topic was brought up in a number of questions Thursday, mostly from a citywide perspective rather than Zone 2 in particular. But Prater did acknowledge “pockets” of his district that need addressed. He didn’t specify which areas. “Part of Zone 2 does need a lot of attention. But if we can raise the level everybody’s boat rises higher. And if we can address poverty citywide I think that’s gonna help Zone 2,” said Prater. Zone Blitz, the city’s poverty alleviation project that is focused in the city’s northwest quadrant of Zone 1, is about halfway through its 18-month term. Gunther says she’s interested to see how it plays out. “I think in theory it’s fantastic. I’m not sure in practice how it’s going. But I think there is a lot of things that they are doing that would really help Zone 2,” she said. (From L-R) Helen Gunther and Thomas Prater Credit Scott Harvey / KSMU Gunther feels the biggest issue facing Zone 2 is vagrancy. “Standing on street corners, begging for money. Going into businesses and asking for money, or bothering their clientele. There’s a lot of issues with the vegrance.” She says it’s affecting some business owners and landlords. She also cites an incident from earlier this week where a person was hit by a car that jumped the curb. The woman, who was supposedly panhandling from the median at Sunshine and Zimmer, was thrown several feet. Her injuries were non-life threatening. “As many are out there and as much as they’re out there I can’t believe it’s taken that long for one of them to get hit.” Springfield City Council had to repeal its ordinance against aggressive panhandling last year after courts had struck down similar laws elsewhere. Gunther says after this week’s incident “it’s a safety issue now and so it may scoot that along a little bit more, but it is gonna have to be addressed. No question.” Prater says City Manager Greg Burris is preparing proposals to that effect in the coming weeks. Overall, Prater feels some homeless resources have been lost. At the same time, the shift in model for how to help these individuals is a good strategy, he says. The Kitchen, Inc., sites Prater, is “Getting ready to open a new place right down the street at the corner of Chestnut and Glenstone that will be an emergency shelter, they’ll have a lot more case workers because trying to keep it at the Missouri Hotel they couldn’t hire all the case workers they needed, and it will help people transition into permanent, long-term housing.” Prater points to the organization’s Beacon Village complex, which helped formerly homeless citizens obtain permanent housing, as part of a nationwide shift that treats the issue of homelessness more effectively. He notes that it’s also key to focus on job placement opportunities for those living in poverty. Gunther says many homeless people are isolated from the rest of society, and believes it can hinder their appetite for finding better solutions. “And I think that the only thing we’re gonna be able to do to get them back into society is a very slow process of getting them more social.” She believes the problem will continue for many years to come. Economic Development Prater notes Zone 2 offers an array of retail, manufacturing. It’s also a district, he says, that has both high income housing and lower income housing and is inconsistent across the board in terms of which students qualify for free and reduced lunch and which once don’t. So he believes there are several three things that must be done to address economic development. Those are being attractive for business, having an educated workforce, and public safety. “No one wants to run a business here if the streets aren’t safe, if the fire calls aren’t getting answered. That’s something that before I came on council I think was an obvious deficit that has been improving  slowly and continues to improve and I think that’s gotta be one of our focuses for the next several years.” Gunther expressed concern with the Springfield’s recent sales tax figures, which is the city’s main source of revenue. “And we know why,” she says. “It’s because of the online stores and we’re losing a lot of our retail to that. I think that until we can start figuring out ways to get that taxed, I think we’re gonna be in trouble.” Gunther adds that once that problem is solved, the focus should shift to brick and mortar stores. “I would seriously hate to own the mall or shopping centers right now, because they’re going to start seeing vacancies in there. And so we’re gonna have to figure out ways to attract people that would want to come into those stores.” Fire Department Coverage The city is currently evaluating a series of options presented by its former fire chief, who resigned in January, on the future of its service capabilities and station locations. The 10 options include, among others, relocating services from the south side to more high demand areas in central Springfield, and building a temporary and then permanent West-Central Neighborhood station.  “I think the major thing we need to do is keep it well-equipped and we may need to expand on it. But as far as building a new fire station we can’t afford it,” says Gunther. Prater says a grant the city is currently seeking could add fire staff, which could help equip a temporary space in central Springfield. “Long-term, there’s a possibility of do we do an eight-cent; I think there’s capability for one-eight cent property tax to fund firefighting that would not raise taxes…that may be the solution in the next several years.” Environmental Regulations Both candidates agree the city needs to remain proactive as it pertains to federal regulations, notably Springfield’s efforts to identify ways to reduce costs to cover unfunded mandates from the Environmental Protection Agency. Prater adds the Springfield Department of Environmental Services is working to decrease the amount of downstream flow to the sewage treatment plant, which he says is over capacity. “If we can prevent stuff – sump pumps from people’s basements or some of the industry waste – from going into the sewer system, then we don’t have to build a big plant downstream. I think the number is for every million dollars we spend upstream we save $11 million downstream.” Gunther says the city has done an “amazing job” addressing these environmental issues, noting what was once federal grant money is now dried up and become loans. According to Gunther, the city manages 1,800 tons of trash and 40 million gallons of raw sewage daily. “You start thinking about that, 18.5 billion gallons of storm water runoff. When you’re looking at numbers like that it just overwhelms you and I seriously think our people are doing a great job.” Footbridge A question about budget management led to opinions on the future of the Jefferson Avenue Footbridge, a more than century old structure that closed last year due to safety concerns. The debate has been whether to preserve the bridge, at a cost of $2.8 million up front and $16.8 million in upkeep over the course of nearly 100 years. “We can’t afford it,” says Gunther. “We have to make decisions I ‘I wants’ and ‘I have to haves.’ And it’s gonna be some tough decisions. I grew up on the north side and I love that footbridge. But I don’t think we can afford it.” The city has already dedicated $200,000 for the structural design phase of the preservation. The funding is available through its 1/8-cent transportation sales tax. Prater, who was present at the January meeting during which the design phase dollars were allocated, says council expressed concern at the time given there was no funding source for the renovation.   “I think you’re going to find council very reluctant to do anything going forward without finding a funding source. And I think that may be a combination of public and private, it may be grants, it may be whatever. But I don’t think you’re going to find council saying ‘this is a great idea we’re going to totally fund that with public money.’” Springfield’s Image What does Springfield’s current image reflect or should it reflect, asked the moderator Thursday. “I would like to see us become a more thriving, younger, higher tech metropolis,” says Prater, adding he feels that’s what will draw young people here and drive economic development long-term. He cites who Springfield has emulated some of development on that of other cities similar in size and demographics, saying the city doesn’t have to “reinvent the wheel” to be successful in crafting a unique image. “What I’ve said is let’s not become the hole in the donut here,” Prater said. “Let’s not become a St. Louis city or a Kansas City where everyone is decided to live around that, everyone has decided to put their businesses around the city. Let’s make it so people want to be in the center, have their businesses, live here, put their kids in school here; I think that’s what’s gonna drive us long-term.” For Gunther, Springfield doesn’t have a strong identity outside of the immediate region. She uses Route 66 as an example where the city can build upon that connection to strengthen its image. “Whenever you say that we are the birthplace of Route 66 they get that. They don’t know where Springfield is but they know Route 66. I would really like to see us be more identified with Route 66. I really would, because I’m very proud of that.” She’d also like Springfeild to be known as a thriving city that has good jobs, good pay, clean air, clean water, and known for that. “A place where people are really proud of and wanna raise their family,” she said.  Funding Campaign finance reports show Prater has been fairly active in fundraising, with more than $9,300 raised as of Feb. 22. Gunther’s campaign shows only $300 raised through the same period.

According to the sheriff's department, a man called and said he was somehow involved in the legal system in Mexico. He convinced the victim that her grandson had been arrested in Mexico and needed money for his defense. The victim put $450 on four different Walmart gift cards and gave them the numbers of the cards when they asked. Captain Randall McGowan with the Weakley County Sheriff's Department said the victim got suspicious when they called back the next day asking for more money. So, she called her grandson who lives in another state. He answered the phone and said he's fine. The area code from the call traces back to Cambodia. If you don't recognize the number, you shouldn't answer. And never give money or personal information over the phone. Download the KFVS News app: iPhone | Android Copyright 2017 KFVS.

The baby is expected to make a full recovery. The infant was one of seven siblings who survived a tragic chain of events that left one person dead in a house fire and a second body recovered from the lake where the baby was found. It all began at 5:15 a.m. Thursday in Glen Carbon, Illinois, when fire broke out at a home owned by Cristy Lynn Campbell. An adult died in the fire, but six children, siblings ranging up to age 14, escaped. Glen Carbon is about 30 miles east of St. Louis. Sheriff John Lakin said the person killed has not been identified, but Campbell’s estranged husband and the father of the children, Justin Campbell, has not been accounted for.

At 5:31 a.m., a motorist passing near Silver Lake in Highland, Illinois, about 25 kilometres from the home, saw a car heading down a hill toward the water and called 911, Lakin said. Highland paramedic Todd Zobrist arrived quickly, jumped into icy water and swam 50 to 75 feet to the SUV, where he found a baby floating inside the car. He pulled the baby by the arm to the hood of the SUV, where he began CPR, then swam with the child to shore. The child, initially unresponsive, is expected to recover and could be released Friday from a hospital in St. Charles, Missouri, Lakin said. “Today was a tragic day all the way around because of both scenes,” Lakin said Thursday. “Fortunately, there is something good that can come of this.” Highland Emergency Medical Services chief Brian Wilson said Zobrist’s actions were heroic. “He definitely saved the child’s life,” Wilson said. After finding the baby, authorities began searching the water. A body was pulled from the lake around 11:15 a.m. The coroner in Madison County, Illinois announced Friday morning that the woman was identified as Cristy Campbell. Coroner Steve Nonn says an autopsy will be conducted Friday to positively identify the person killed in the fire. <strongWATCH: Residents praise paramedic who pulled baby from SUV submerged in icy lake Court records showed that Cristy Campbell and Justin Campbell, 37, had a volatile relationship. In 2005, before they were married, Justin Campbell was charged with domestic abuse for allegedly attacking Cristy Campbell, then known as Cristy Brueggemann, by slapping her in the head when she was pregnant. He was sentenced in March 2006 to probation and fined $500. Despite the violence, they wed on Nov. 3, 2006. She filed for legal separation in September 2010, but the matter was dismissed two months later. In April 2012, Cristy Campbell obtained an emergency protection order against her husband and filed for divorce, alleging in court papers that he “abuses me on a weekly basis,” including punching and choking her. “He has told me that I’m a no-good wife,” Campbell wrote in her application for the protection order. The divorce was granted in February 2013. Lakin said Glen Carbon police have answered several calls to Campbell’s home, including some “domestic-related situations,” but he declined to elaborate. “The Glen Carbon Police Department was aware of that house,” Lakin said. Authorities said the children are with Illinois authorities and will be placed with relatives. © 2017 The Associated Press Report an error Baby Saved From Submerged SUV Christy Campbell Glen Carbon Highland County EMS Illinois Justin Campbell Madison County Silver Lake Todd Zobrist Editor's Picks Money U.S. sues Vancouver dual citizen for over $1M for not reporting accounts Canada Simple roadside tests can identify pot-impaired drivers, study shows Money Canadians in the sharing economy are running out of excuses not to pay taxes Entertainment Amal Clooney's baby bump steals spotlight from her genocide speech at UN Tech 'Beware of all things smart,' privacy guru warns in wake of Wikleaks disclosure Politics Young women fill House of Commons on International Women's Day Canada Canadian permanent residents from 6 countries could be affected by Trump’s new travel ban Health I’m vaccinated but I still got the mumps?

Global companies with a permit to sell local food items — Amazon.com Inc. is reported to have applied for a license — may also be allowed to market made-in-India non-food products such as toothpaste and towels worth about 25 per cent of total sales, the official said, asking not to be identified citing rules on speaking to the media. India may also allow more foreign direct investment in multibrand retail if companies such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Carrefour SA agree to stock only local products. While India already offers 100 per cent foreign ownership in food and 51 per cent in multibrand retail, there are few takers due to strict rules including those that require companies to put half their investment into warehouses and other back-end infrastructure. Retail is a sensitive subject in India, and tough opposition to slash rules comes from within Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party because its traditional support base has been small traders. This month’s broad, decisive win in state polls can embolden Modi to overlook some of this opposition as he struggles to create jobs before national elections in 2019. While India is dotted with mom-and-pop stores that employ local residents, these jobs aren’t well paying and don’t offer the insurance and leave benefits that typically accompany a formal employment contract. Make-in-India The proposals can also help Modi’s flagship Make-in-India campaign to boost local manufacturing. While India attracted $324 billion foreign direct investment from 2000 through the end of 2016, the biggest share of $58 billion has gone to services and only about $14 billion has come into trading. About 44 per cent of India’s $620 billion (Dh1,190 billion) retail market comprises food and grocery items, said Arvind Singhal, chairman at consultancy firm Technopak Advisors Pvt. While the sector has been growing by 12 per cent each year, foreign companies are staying away because the government’s policies are too restrictive or confusing, he said. India’s department of industrial policy and promotion is considering allowing 100 per cent foreign direct investment in products which carry the Made-in-India label, the official said. An external company handling media relations for Amazon didn’t immediately comment on a report that Amazon has sought a food retail license. JP Mattu, spokeswoman of the commerce and industry ministry, didn’t answer calls to her mobile phone yesterday.

Photo by Adrees Latif/Files/Reuters Editor’s note: We’ve all heard of the great divide between life in rural and urban America. But what are the factors that contribute to these differences? We asked sociologists, economists, geographers and historians to describe the divide from different angles. The data paint a richer and sometimes surprising picture of the U.S. today. 1. Poverty is higher in rural areas Discussions of poverty in the United States often mistakenly focus on urban areas. While urban poverty is a unique challenge, rates of poverty have historically been higher in rural than urban areas. In fact, levels of rural poverty were often double those in urban areas throughout the 1950s and 1960s. While these rural-urban gaps have diminished markedly, substantial differences persist. In 2015, 16.7 percent of the rural population was poor, compared with 13.0 percent of the urban population overall – and 10.8 percent among those living in suburban areas outside of principal cities. Contrary to common assumptions, substantial shares of the poor are employed. Approximately 45 percent of poor, prime-age (25-54) householders worked at least part of 2015 in rural and urban areas alike. The link between work and poverty was different in the past. In the early 1980s, the share of the rural poor that was employed exceeded that in urban areas by more than 15 percent. Since then, more and more poor people in rural areas are also unemployed – a trend consistent with other patterns documented below. That said, rural workers continue to benefit less from work than their urban counterparts. In 2015, 9.8 percent of rural, prime-age working householders were poor, compared with 6.8 percent of their urban counterparts. Nearly a third of the rural working poor faced extreme levels of deprivation, with family incomes below 50 percent of the poverty line, or approximately US$12,000 for a family of four. Large shares of the rural workforce also live in economically precarious circumstances just above the poverty line. Nearly one in five rural working householders lived in families with incomes less than 150 percent of the poverty line. That’s nearly five percentage points more than among urban workers (13.5 percent). According to recent research, rural-urban gaps in working poverty cannot be explained by rural workers’ levels of education, industry of employment or other similar factors that might affect earnings. Rural poverty – at least among workers – cannot be fully explained by the characteristics of the rural population. That means reducing rural poverty will require attention to the structure of rural economies and communities. – Brian Thiede, Assistant Professor of Rural Sociology and Demography, Pennsylvania State University 2. Most new jobs aren’t in rural areas It’s easy to see why many rural Americans believe the recession never ended: For them, it hasn’t. Rural communities still haven’t recovered the jobs they lost in the recession. Census data show that the rural job market is smaller now – 4.26 percent smaller, to be exact – than it was in 2008. In these data are shuttered coal mines on the edges of rural towns and boarded-up gas stations on rural main streets. In these data are the angers, fears and frustrations of much of rural America. This isn’t a new trend. Mechanization, environmental regulations and increased global competition have been slowly whittling away at resource extraction economies and driving jobs from rural communities for most of the 20th century. But the fact that what they’re experiencing now is simply the cold consequences of history likely brings little comfort to rural people. If anything, it only adds to their fear that what they once had is gone and it’s never coming back. Nor is it likely that the slight increase in rural jobs since 2013 brings much comfort. As the resource extraction economy continues to shrink, most of the new jobs in rural areas are being created in the service sector. So Appalachian coal miners and Northwest loggers are now stocking shelves at the local Walmart. The identity of rural communities used to be rooted in work. The signs at the entrances of their towns welcomed visitors to coal country or timber country. Towns named their high school mascots after the work that sustained them, like the Jordan Beetpickers in Utah or the Camas Papermakers in Washington. It used to be that, when someone first arrived at these towns, they knew what people did and that they were proud to do it. That’s not so clear anymore. How do you communicate your communal identity when the work once at the center of that identity is gone, and calling the local high school football team the “Walmart Greeters” simply doesn’t have the same ring to it? Looking at rural jobs data, is it so hard to understand why many rural people are nostalgic for the past and fearful for the future? – Steven Beda, Instructor of History, University of Oregon 3. Disabilities are more common in rural areas Disability matters in rural America. Data from the American Community Survey, an annual government poll, reveal that disability is more prevalent in rural counties than their urban counterparts. The rate of disability increases from 11.8 percent in the most urban metropolitan counties to 15.6 percent in smaller micropolitan areas and 17.7 percent in the most rural, or noncore, counties. While rural-urban differences in disability have been analyzed previously, researchers have had little opportunity to further explore this disparity, as updated data on rural disability were unavailable until recently. Fortunately, the census released updated new county-level disability estimates in 2014, ending a 14-year knowledge gap. The release of these estimates has also allowed us to build a picture of geographic variations in disability across the nation. Disability rates vary significantly across the U.S. Although the national trend of higher disability rates in rural counties persists at the regional and even divisional level, it is clear that disability in rural America is not homogeneous. Rates of rural disability range from around 15 percent in the Great Plains to 21 percent in the central South. Data reveal notable differences between rural and urban America. Source: American Community Survey (ACS) 2011-2015 5 year estimates, Table S1810, CC BY. Image courtesy of The Conversation A variety of factors may be behind these regional and rural differences, including differences in demographics, economic patterns, health and service access and state disability policies. While this survey provides a glimpse into the national prevalence of disability and reveals a persistent rural-urban disparity, it is important to note its limitations. Disability is the result of an interaction between an individual and his or her environment. Therefore, these data do not directly measure disability, as they measure only physical function and do not consider environmental factors such as inaccessible housing. – Lillie Greiman and Andrew Myers, Project Directors at the Rural Institute for Inclusive Communities at the University of Montana; Christiane von Reichert, Professor of Geography, University of Montana 4. Rural areas are surprisingly entrepreneurial The United States’ continuing economic dominance is perhaps most attributable to the very smallest elements of its economy: its entrepreneurial start-ups. Nearly 700,000 new job-creating businesses open each year. That’s almost 2,000 every day, each helping to create new market niches in the global economy. Most people mistakenly believe these pioneering establishments occur in overwhelmingly in metropolitan areas, such as in the now-mythic start-up culture of Silicon Valley. Yet, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, it is in fact nonmetropolitan counties that have higher rates of self-employed business proprietors than their metropolitan counterparts. Furthermore, the more rural the county, the higher its level of entrepreneurship. Some of these counties have a farming legacy – perhaps the most entrepreneurial of occupations – but farmers represent less than one-sixth of business owners in nonmetro areas. Even for nonfarm enterprises, rural entrepreneurship rates are higher. The reality is that rural areas have to be entrepreneurial, as industries with concentrations of wage and salary jobs are necessarily scarce. Start-up businesses have notoriously difficult survival prospects. So it is perhaps even more surprising that relatively isolated nonmetropolitan businesses are on average more resilient than their metro cousins, despite the considerable economic advantages of urban areas, which boast a denser networks of workers, suppliers and markets. The resilience of rural start-ups is perhaps due to more cautious business practices in areas with few alternative employment options. This resilience is also remarkably persistent over time, consistently being at least on par with metro start-ups, and regularly having survival rates up to 10 percentage points higher than in metro areas over 1990-2007. – Stephan Weiler, Professor of Economics, Colorado State University; Tessa Conroy and Steve Deller, Professors of Economics, University of Wisconsin-Madison This article was originally published on The Conversation.

Her death is connected with a fatal fire miles away at her home. Her children ran out of the home for help. Her youngest child was in the car in the lake and was rescued from the frigid water. The fire broke out early Thursday morning on Dogwood Lane in Glen Carbon, Illinois. Firefighters discovered a man's body inside of the house. Four children ran to a nearby Walmart for help. Cristy L. Campbell lived in the house. Officials say she drove away in an SUV with her three-month-old son. The SUV ended up partially submerged in Silver Lake in Highland, Illinois. A paramedic rescued the child. Campbell's body was discovered in the lake a short time later. Court records indicate Campbell and her husband had a troubled relationship, filing for divorce twice. Glen Carbon police had been to the home 50 times in seven years, sometimes for domestic problems and 9-1-1 hangups. Now the community is coming together to help the seven surviving children, who are now with relatives. Fundraisers are already planned to support the children. The Edwardsville Little Tigers football team and the Edwardsville Wrestling Club are collecting donations of clothes, shoes, toys and money for the children. It will be held at the Tiger Country Building from 6 p.m. until 8 p.m. Friday, March 17th.

Rich Duprey (TMFCop) Mar 17, 2017 at 10:11AM Federal regulators made the wrong call in denying Staples' (NASDAQ:SPLS) bid to merge with Office Depot (NASDAQ:ODP), but they can't afford to make another mistake with Bass Pro Shops' attempt to acquire Cabela's (NYSE:CAB). There have been a string of bankruptcies in the industry over the past year or so, and peer Gander Mountain just announced it was seeking Chapter 11 protection. These conditions would typically make antitrust regulators wary of signing off on a deal because of the concentration in competition, however it's precisely because so many companies are going under that the feds need to allow this deal to go through. Image source: Cabela's. The ever-present threat When Staples sought to take over its office supplies rival, it was in the midst of changes in the marketplace that had upended their business in the wake of the financial market's collapse. Although many companies had cut back on purchases, the rise of Amazon.com and e-commerce, as well as mass market retailers such as Wal-Mart and Costco entering the space, had taken large swaths of business away from the specialty retailers. They were now "over-stored," and though each was closing hundreds of locations, their businesses were substantially weakened. Only together could they effectively take on the competitive forces arrayed against them. The feds didn't see it that way, preferring instead to look at Staples and Office Depot's commercial contract business and the possibility that Staples and Office Depot could leverage their position to raise prices. But Staples noted 99% of its customers would not see prices rise and the combination would allow them to streamline their operations and save money. There were arguments to be made against joining the two and the government ultimately killed the deal. Now Staples and Office Depot continue to reel from the denial. Staples said sales fell almost 3% in the fourth quarter as comparable sales fell nearly 1%. Its retail operations were in free fall, with net sales tumbling 7% for the year on a 5% drop in comps, leading it to record operating losses of $264 million compared to the $716 million operating profit it earned the year before. It closed 48 stores in North America last year and expects to close another 70 this year. It wasn't any better for Office Depot, which reported a 6% decline in revenue in 2016, while its business solutions revenue was down 6% year over year. It closed 123 stores last year and anticipates closing another 75 in 2017. Office Depot also ended up selling its European operations, too. Image source: Bass Pro Shops. Sporting goods is no better In the outdoor sporting goods market, an argument could be made that conditions are as dire as they are in office supplies -- if not worse. Beyond Gander Mountain's just-declared bankruptcy, the industry has also lost Eastern Mountain Sports, Sports Chalet, City Sports, and of course Sports Authority. Last month MC Sports went under, while niche players Golfsmith and Total Hockey have failed, too. That has created opportunities for some other retailers, including Dick's Sporting Goods (NYSE:DKS), which acquired dozens of stores from its defunct rivals. It also makes it easy to draw parallels to the electronics store space, where Best Buy is the last man standing after Circuit City, hhgregg, and RadioShack went bankrupt (twice, in RadioShack's case). Bed Bath & Beyond is also left the leader in home goods after the demise of Linens n Things. Yet those that remain still face a difficult retail environment as e-commerce and discount retailers siphon off customers. Cabela's has been particularly hard hit as not only did total revenues fall 5% in its fiscal fourth quarter on a 6.4% drop in comps, but even its internet and catalog sales fell, tumbling more than 12% for the period. Where many retailers are finding a silver lining in their online sales even if their in-store sales are poor, Cabela's isn't even enjoying that benefit. A mistake to let it weaken further For antitrust regulators to leave such a sickly company in the marketplace doesn't improve competition, but rather wastes resources. Bass Pro Shops may come to regret purchasing its rival, but that's a business decision it's making and there's still the possibility it could turn Cabela's business around while its own operations more financially sound. While the deal seems to have the wheels coming off it on its own -- as seen in the potential failure of Cabela's to unload its banking business -- it would be a mistake for regulators to not approve the deal. They did so with the Staples-Office Depot merger, and those companies are suffering as a result. They should avoid repeating their error with Cabela's and Bass Pro Shops.

U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service Screenshot i By ELIZABETH KOH ekoh@mcclatchy.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story A California company is recalling more than 21,000 pounds of frozen pizza after suspecting that it might be contaminated with listeria. The bacteria can cause listeriosis, which can trigger serious and sometimes deadly infections in older adults or people with weaker immune systems, and cause miscarriages, stillbirths or serious complications for pregnant women. The product, “Marketside Extra Large Supreme Pizza,” was sold at Walmarts and other stores in California, Nevada, Utah and Washington, according to a statement from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service. RBR Meat Company, Inc., headquartered in Vernon, near Los Angeles, Calif., discovered the problem after routine sampling, according to the USDA, and has not received confirmed reports of negative consequences because of their consumption. Customers who have a product with lot code 20547 and establishment number “EST. 1821” inside the USDA mark of inspection are being instructed to throw away or return the item to the stores where they were purchased.

Global companies with a permit to sell local food items -- Amazon.com Inc. has applied for a license -- may also be allowed to market made-in-India non-food products such as toothpaste and towels worth about 25 percent of total sales, the official said, asking not to be identified citing rules on speaking with the media. India may also allow more foreign direct investment in multibrand retail if companies such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Carrefour SA agree to stock only local products. While India already offers 100 percent foreign ownership in food and 51 percent in multibrand retail, there are few takers due to strict rules including those that require companies to put half their investment into warehouses and other back-end infrastructure. Retail is a sensitive subject in India, and tough opposition to slash rules comes from within Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party because its traditional support base has been small traders. This month’s broad, decisive win in state polls can embolden Modi to overlook some of this opposition as he struggles to create jobs before national elections in 2019. While India is dotted with mom-and-pop stores that employ local residents, these jobs aren’t well paying and don’t offer the insurance and leave benefits that typically accompany a formal employment contract. Make in India The proposals can also help Modi’s flagship Make-in-India campaign to boost local manufacturing. While India attracted $324 billion foreign direct investment from 2000 through the end of 2016, the biggest share of $58 billion has gone to services and only about $14 billion has come into trading. About 44 percent of India’s $620 billion retail market comprises food and grocery items, said Arvind Singhal, chairman at consultancy firm Technopak Advisors Pvt. While the sector has been growing by 12 percent each year, foreign companies are staying away because the government’s policies are too restrictive or confusing, he said. India’s department of industrial policy and promotion is considering allowing 100 percent foreign direct investment in products which carry the Made-in-India label, the official said. Amazon’s Indian unit has sought approval to invest and partner with the government for a food supply chain, the company said in an emailed statement on Friday. JP Mattu, spokeswoman of the commerce and industry ministry, didn’t answer calls to her mobile phone on Friday. Stay on top of business news with The Economic Times App. Download it Now!

Travis Hoium (TMFFlushDraw) Mar 17, 2017 at 9:11AM There's no question that the world of retail is changing, with growth in online shopping dominated by Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) at the moment. But for everyday life, the move to online retail feels more like a trickle than a revolution. For example, I still shop at the grocery store multiple times a week, and Target (NYSE:TGT) on a regular basis, augmenting with orders on Amazon for random items. And for me, the shift to online shopping has been slowly taking place over the course of over 10 years.  Every once in a while, you get a new perspective on retail that shows who's building out the right strategy for the future, and who isn't. In my case, my wife and I are soon expecting a child, and it's led to a mind-numbing number of store visits, online searches, and calls with customer service at suppliers across the country. Who knew having a baby would show everything that's wrong with retail today?  Image source: Getty Images. The inventory problem One of the biggest challenges retailers face is inventory. The goal is to buy enough product so that shelves are stocked and move quickly, but not so much that a retailer has to carry inventory for a long time, or even resorts to discounting.  Walmart (NYSE:WMT) has always been a master of inventory management, which has been one of the keys to its long-term success. But over the last seven years, the number of times its inventory has turned over each year -- sales divided by average inventory -- has fallen 9%. The same percentage decline has happened at Target, which had slower turns in the first place.  TGT Inventory Turnover (TTM) data by YCharts. What can retailers do to solve this? They could hold less inventory, and risk not having the items customers need when they come to the store, which could push shoppers online where there's more inventory at their fingertips. They could also carry fewer items, but more inventory of each item. This may result in a higher likelihood of having the right-colored item that a buyer wants, but risks not having the item at all. Again, if a retailer doesn't have the item, it's likely pushing customers online.  The supplier problem This challenge extends to suppliers, as well, and can be easily seen in the challenges of product companies like Fitbit (NYSE:FIT) and GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO). They've been plagued by lagging sales, which leads to inventory writedowns, which leads to less investment in new products and a downward cycle for their businesses.  The challenge is that product companies have inventory at the company level, at distributors, and at retailers, which is a supply-chain problem for everyone involved. If there's not enough inventory in the channel, you have product shortages and missed sales (see GoPro's Q4 2016). If there's too much, a company can risk discounting, or returns and writedowns (see GoPro's Q4 2015). The perfect balance is almost impossible to attain.  This is why I recently advocated for companies like GoPro and Fitbit to move away from the retail model altogether and sell online, where there's inherently less inventory in the supply chain, and therefore less inventory risk at the supplier level. But that would cut retailers out of the model altogether.  The supply-chain problem Finally, the problems I highlighted above show what's wrong with the entire supply chain and why retailers may be destined to fail. When my wife and I go shopping for a car seat or stroller, we're trying items and seeing how we like the look and feel. But invariably, when we make a decision on what we want to buy, it's never in stock at the retailer. I don't even know how many times I've heard, "We can order that and it'll be here in a few weeks." My other option is that I could order it on Amazon and I'll have it in two days.  This is why the supply chain is a problem for retail. As sales have shrunk and inventory turns have trended lower, companies are trying to hold less inventory -- which is understandable. But as they hold less inventory, they're less likely to have what I want when I want it, meaning they become a showroom for a purchase I eventually make online.  The entire model needs to be blown up and rethought by everyone, or Amazon is destined to take over the world -- which may already be happening.  Rethinking retail I think there's still a lot of value in the showroom for customers, especially when you're buying an item for a baby, or furniture, or clothing. Getting an idea how these items feel or look in person simply can't be replaced by an online shopping experience.  But retailers should appreciate that they're now a showroom, and should use that to their advantage. I'd be willing to buy a big-ticket item from a local retailer and let them handle logistics if I knew it would be delivered to my home in a few days. But if their sales and delivery process is more complicated than buying online, then I'll take my business elsewhere. With inventory becoming a problem for retailers, a move to a showroom model may help both retailers and product companies, who could ship items direct to customers via the retailer. Of course, this would be rethinking retail as we know it.  What's clear is that something has to change for retailers. They're in a death spiral of falling inventory turns leading to less inventory, and losing more sales online. Unless the whole retail industry is upended, this could be a spiral that will be hard to escape.  Travis Hoium owns shares of GoPro.

Minyanville Target Corporation (TGT) Stock Will Keep Sinking Without This Change By Scutify Mar 16, 2017 10:33 am PRINT   Stay Connected This article is published in collaboration with Scutify, where you can find real-time markets and stock commentary from Robert Marcin, Cody Willard and others. Download the Scutify iOS App, the Scutify Android App or visit Scutify.com. TGT needs to invest more in its digital infrastructure Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) released its fourth-quarter and full-year 2016 results before the market opened on Feb. 28. Target stock investors were not happy with the results. Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified) Fourth-quarter earnings came in at $1.45 per share, well below analyst expectations of $1.51. Revenue also slumped, falling to $20.7 billion, a 4.3% decline versus 2015's final quarter. Guidance for TGT stock was even worse. Target currently projects a full-year profit for 2017 of between $3.80 and $4.20 per share, well below analysts expectations of $5.34 per share or 2016's adjusted earnings, which ended up at $5.01 per share. Revenue was also projected to take another hit. Target stock ended that day down more than 13%, closing at $58.77. TGT stock has since declined even further, currently trading hands at $54.25. Shares haven't been this low since 2014. Value investors are likely taking a serious look at Target stock at today's levels. After all, it trades at less than 14 times the midpoint of 2017's earnings guidance. It also trades at a price-to-sales ratio of just 0.43. Despite those attractive metrics, TGT stock is likely to be a value trap for years to come, unless the company really starts getting serious about growing its online presence. Time for TGT to Take Online Seriously One of the lone bright spots of Target's abysmal fourth quarter were online sales. Digital sales skyrocketed 34% higher during the all-important holiday season. As part of its turnaround program, TGT announced it was going to spend $7 billion between now and 2020 on long-term improvements. These include remodeling some 600 stores, introducing 12 new brands across the housewares and clothing departments and increasing its small format store count to 130. Naturally, there will be investments made in the digital platform as well. By the time Target remodels 600 stores, most of that $7 billion will be used up. Is that really enough to compete in a world where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) dominates? Let's put Target's digital sales in perspective. In its most recent quarter, 6.8% of total sales were done digitally. Its top line was $20.7 billion, putting digital sales at $1.4 billion. Amazon did $43.74 billion in sales during the same quarter, all digitally. It took TGT a whole quarter to accomplish what Amazon did in three days. It's hard to compete with that. Remember, Target's sales declined 4.3% in its most recent quarter, despite being buoyed by its online business. And its reaction is to invest more money into its stores? Wouldn't a savvy management team realize online has all the growth potential? Next Page The Solution? Just Copy a Competitor That kind of error in judgement is even worse when we look at what Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE:WMT) is doing. In October, the world's largest retailer announced it would be doubling down on its digital investments and slowing store openings. It pledged to spend $11 billion in capital expenditures annually over the next two years. Just 20% of that amount will go towards opening new stores. Most will end up being spent on digital initiatives, including new distribution centers to get online purchases out quickly. Also keep in mind Walmart has been making acquisitions to bolster its digital business, including buying Jet.com for $3 billion last summer and Moosejaw, a Michigan-based specialty apparel retailer with a strong online presence, in February. It also has a 10.8% stake in JD.com Inc(ADR) (NASDAQ:JD), which is worth approximately $5 billion at today's prices. It's obvious these digital investments are working. Walmart's digital sales increased by 29% in its most recent quarter. Yes, that's less than Target's percentage increase, but keep in mind Walmart is a larger player online today than TGT is. It's delivering 29% growth on a much bigger base. The Bottom Line on Target Stock The difference in attitude between Walmart and TGT is amazing. Target is much more worried about its stores, while Walmart is investing aggressively into its digital platform. Until the company really starts to take its digital sales seriously and dedicate most of its capital expenditures to that part of the retail world, it's easy to avoid Target stock. The company just isn't embracing the future. As of this writing, Nelson Smith did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

The infant was one of seven siblings who survived a tragic chain of events that left two people dead, the AP reports. It began at 5:15am in Glen Carbon, when fire broke out at a home owned by Cristy Lynn Campbell. An adult died in the fire, but six children, siblings up to age 14, escaped. Sheriff John Lakin says the person killed hasn't been IDed, but Campbell's ex-husband and the father of the kids, Justin Campbell, hasn't been accounted for. Some of the kids ran to a nearby Walmart, others to a nearby home. The children at the Walmart asked a worker to call 911, Lakin says. Cristy Campbell wasn't in the home when firefighters arrived, nor was the couple's seventh child, a 3-month-old boy. At 5:31am, a motorist near Highland's Silver Lake saw a car heading down a hill toward the water and called 911, Lakin notes. Highland paramedic Todd Zobrist arrived quickly, jumped into the 46-degree water, and swam 50 to 75 feet to the SUV, where he found a baby floating in the car. The child, initially unresponsive, is expected to recover, Lakin says. A body was pulled from the lake around 11:15am, and while it hasn't been IDed, Lakin says police are no longer searching for Cristy Campbell. Court records show the Campbells had a volatile relationship, including domestic abuse charges and a protective order against Justin Campbell. Authorities say the children are with Illinois authorities and will be placed with relatives.   View 3 more images My Take on This Story Report a story error Show results without voting  |   1% Hilarious 6% Intriguing 57% Depressing 18% Brilliant 14% Scary 5% Ridiculous Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Email Story 9 comments Copyright 2017 Newser, LLC.
