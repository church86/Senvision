The Walmart Supercenter is planned for 32 acres in the northwest quadrant of the South 74th Street and Illinois 15 intersection. This summer, the Planning Commission is expected to vote on the final plat for the store, which will also have a Walmart gas station with eight pumps. A spokesman for Walmart could not be reached for comment. John Schebaum, an engineer and designer for BFA Engineering of Washington, Mo., who is representing Walmart during the permitting process in Belleville, told the commissioners that the land is undermined and that further research will be done on how to mitigate the site. Shoppers would enter the stores off 74th Street. Schebaum also told the commissioners a left turn lane would be added on 74th Street for motorists who want to go east on Illinois 15. An engineer told Belleville officials the land for the proposed Walmart Supercenter is undermined, and research will be done on how to mitigate the site. Annissa McCaskill, director of the city’s Economic Development, Planning and Zoning Department, said the city will not pay for this roadwork and that a developer typically has to pay for this type of work. The Supercenter will be 195,000 square feet, which is slightly smaller than the Supercenter on the east side, but it will have all the “bells and whistles” Walmart offers in new Supercenters, Schebaum said. The gas station will have a 1,500-square-foot convenience store, and one other retail outlot would be offered to another business. Schebaum said he did not have information on when construction could begin, but he said the permitting process will probably take at least until the fall. Unlike the Walmart Supercenter off Carlyle Avenue, the developers of this Walmart have not asked for tax incentives from the city. Later this month, the city’s Zoning Board of Appeals is expected to hear requests from Walmart for permission to sell alcohol and for a variance on the store’s sign. facebook twitter email Share More Videos 2:17 Belleville leaders learn details of new Walmart on city's west side Pause 4:57 Belleville City Clerk Dallas Cook discusses public safety ahead of mayoral election 1:09 12-year-old who had kidney transplant throws out first pitch at Cards game 1:11 Flooding may cause more mobile home owners to evacuate 1:41 Here's what we know about death of Breese teen 1:30 Latest from juvenile hearing on death of Breese teen punched at party 6:03 School employees joke about who they would marry, kill or sleep with.

Kroger is the most-loved grocery store in America. Here's how to save there Before you go, we thought you'd like these... READ MORE READ MORE READ MORE Share Mike Brassfield May 4th 2017 4:37PM When we shop for groceries, we want the meat and produce to be fresh. We appreciate good customer service. And we like a bargain. When it comes to customer satisfaction at the supermarket, you'll see various surveys that rank different grocery stores at the top. Sometimes you're king of the hill, and sometimes you're not. A new survey puts Kroger at the top. Kroger! That's a different result than some other surveys we've seen. Morning Consult, a public opinion data company, got the opinion of nearly 200,000 consumers on 500 of America's biggest brands. When it came to grocery stores, 53% had a favorable view toward Kroger. Whole Foods was second with 48%, and Safeway followed at 40%. Regional chains Albertsons and Publix were each at 33%. If you're going to check out any these supermarkets to see if you like them as much as other customers do, you should check out our tips on saving. Here are our money-saving secrets for shopping at Kroger, Whole Foods and Publix. RELATED: Common supermarket traps you should always avoid: 11 PHOTOS 10 supermarket traps See Gallery 10 supermarket traps Large shopping carts According to Martin Lindstrom, the larger the shopping cart, the more likely you are to spend. The marketing consultant told The Consumerist, "We doubled their size as a test, and customers bought 19% more." Pleasing aromas and colorful sights Walking into a grocery store and smelling freshly baked goods and flowers, especially if you're in a good mood, is a surefire way to get you to throw a few unnecessary items into your cart as your begin shopping experience. Fresh produce first​ After you've already been tricked into picking up a loaf of bread or some flowers, supermarkets also get you by placing the produce in the front of the store. By doing this, they fool you into believing you're being healthier by shopping for fruits and veggies first so you won't feel bad if you decide to stock up on a few unhealthier snacks along the way to checkout, too. Mist on produce You may think the mist on fresh fruits and veggies is helping the produce, but in all actuality, it makes them rot faster. Also, be sure to shake off the access water before purchasing your produce -- the mist tends to add additional weight, making the price go up. Slow, boring music Have you ever wondered why most grocery stores play some sort of elevator music? It's because they want you to take your time while shopping. Many stores play music slower than the average heartbeat, so pop your headphones in and play upbeat music to combat this trick. 10-for-$10 promotions It's common to believe you're getting a great deal during a 10-for-$10 promotion, but say, if a can of beans was originally 87 cents, you're actually paying more versus buying 10 of the same cans when they aren't on "sale." Dairy being in the back of the store The reasoning behind the age-old trick of placing milk and other dairy products in the back of the store may surprise you. Although it forces you to walk through various aisles, the true reason is because trucks unload their shipments in the back of store, and since milk needs to be refrigerated immediately, the easiest place to keep it is in the back. More expensive items at eye level If you've ever wondered why all of the expensive items seem to be the most accessible, there's a reason behind that, too. Supermarkets place cheaper items on the lower and higher shelves and reserve the middle, or eyesight level, shelves for their most expensive products. Buying premium deli products Just because you are buying a seemingly fresh cut of meat or fish from the deli and paying a higher price, doesn't necessarily mean the product is of better quality. Often times, the meat was previously frozen meaning you may have to use it sooner than meat you would buy from the frozen section. Changing the layout of the store... often Don't get too comfortable with your local supermarket's layout. Markets believe that when a person remembers where there items they plan on buying are, they'll spend less time in the store and will ultimately spend less money.

What's the Best Grocery Store? Depends Who You Ask So according to this new survey, Kroger is king. Yay, Kroger! But like we mentioned, different surveys have shown us different results. For instance, the American Customer Satisfaction Index conducts an in-depth survey of customer satisfaction at grocery stores every year. Most recently, the highest-ranking chains in ACSI's survey were Trader Joe's, Publix, Aldi, H-E-B, Wegmans and Whole Foods, in that order. Kroger was in the middle of the pack. Ranked lowest: Walmart. Walmart was also at the bottom of Consumer Reports' grocery store ranking. Consumer Reports surveyed its readers, asking them to rank supermarket chains based on factors like freshness, selection, cleanliness, customer service and prices. In fact, Walmart is routinely ranked the worst for customer satisfaction among grocery stores, even though more Americans buy their groceries at Walmart than anywhere else. Time magazine spells out the reason why Walmart has become Americans' most popular destination for groceries: "For a large portion of shoppers, price simply trumps all when it comes to groceries." If you're shopping for food at Walmart, you're probably doing it to save money. Here's how to save even more money there. Your Turn: Where is your favorite place to shop for groceries?

"She didn't lose her head. She was calm and was able to think on her feet and come up with a solution that got her to safety," said Lt. Keith Czeskleba with Hoover police. Investigators say 49-year old George Charles Harris Jr. approached the woman in the Walmart parking lot on Highway 280, as she was leaving late Tuesday night. He asked for a ride, and when she refused that's when things went south. "And then the male put his hand inside of his pocket to indicate he was armed," said Czeskleba. According to police, Harris told the woman to get in the car and then ordered her to take him to a nearby ATM.  But that's when the victim's fast thinking kicked in. "She was able to convince him that she didn't have any money at an ATM, but that she might be able to get some money from the store if he would let her go back to the store," said Czeskleba. The woman then went back inside where police were called. Within minutes, Harris went from sitting in the backseat of the victim's vehicle to sitting in the back of a patrol car. "We're certainly glad that she is ok and that the person responsible for this is going to have to answer for it," said Czeskleba. Harris is charged with first-degree robbery, first-degree kidnapping, unlawful possession of drug paraphernalia fourth-degree and theft of property.  He's being held in the Shelby County jail on a $520,000 bond.

He’s now at Walmart because they acquired his ecommerce start up Jet.com. Now at Walmart, he’s heading up the Walmart ecommerce business. And that’s a big deal in the US as both retailer and marketplace. He’s of particular interest because he is both likeable and candid and has been around the block a few times. And taking on Walmart’s online business is a huge task. In the video he explores the scale of the challenge. In this video Lore addresses the buy out, the philosophy behind Jet.com and how he’s working that into Walmart’s DNA. And he also addresses the challenges that Walmart is facing online when taking on the ever insurgent Amazon. In particular he’s keen to explore the fulfilment possibilities of leveraging Walmart’s infrastructure and the possibilities of click & collect. As he notes Walmart has has 6700 strong fleet of trucks and that offers advantages: “Our cost to ship to the store is 75 cents a box, but to ship it to your home, it’s $5.” He aims to make collection in store a more attractive option. And he does also examine that Amazon is going great guns and he’s sometimes on the back foot. He says “there are certainly areas where we are playing defense, and we’re behind and need to catch up. One example is the long-tail categories that we’re going after with acquisitions.” It looks like Walmart is aware that it doesn’t have the Amazon choice and breadth of inventory. Seldom does a senior executive anywhere acknowledge the completion is doing it better than they are. Have your say Click here to cancel reply.

Swagbucks: Swagbucks is one of my favorite online sites! It allows you to earn free giftcards to Target, Walmart, CVS, Amazon, Starbucks, Walmart, Kohl's, Paypal, Domino's (and many other stores) just by doing activities online. Basically, you do things like searching on their search engine (instead of Google), answering surveys, watching videos, playing games, making online purchases at major retailers through their website and more and they reward you with points called "SB points." You cash in the SB points for gift cards! I have been a member for years and have earned a bunch of gift cards. See below for a sign up bonus. Swagbucks Sign Up Bonus: It's free to sign up for Swagbucks HERE and only takes a minute. New members usually get 30 Swagbucks when you sign up. Right now, if you sign up through this link HERE, you can score 70 Swag Bucks when you click the text that reads "I have a sign up code" during registration and then enter the code SMARTSHOPPER to get the bonus. Make sure you use all caps since it is case sensitive. It only takes 500 SB points for a $5 gift card! How do you get these SB points? There are lots of ways. * Search online: Each time you need to search for something online, use the Swagbucks search engine on their website (instead of Google). I actually have the Swagbucks toolbar installed on my desktop and it places a search box right on my screen making it super easy to search. Every once in a while, they award SB points just for doing the searches I used to do using Google. * Take surveys on their website * Answer the daily poll * Watch videos through their website or multiple mobile apps (I earn about 80 - 100 SB a day doing this) * Use their online shopping portal (I do most of my online shopping at major retailers who are part of the Swagbucks Shop and Earn program (like Amazon.com, Kohls.com, Walmart.com and more) and earn Swagbucks every time I shop. Recently I was credited with 562 SB points (worth $5.62 in gift cards) for an online purchase I made a few weeks ago. * Play games * Participate in special Swag Code events * Enter the daily Swag Code (which we usually let you know about here on the blog each day). Swagbucks posts bonus codes on their Facebook, Twitter and blog pages each day. If you have the Swagbucks Mobile App, it will buzz when there is a new code. When the code becomes available each day, one of us posts it here on the blog so we can all get it. The codes are only valid for an hour usually. Once you get the code, you then copy and paste the code into the Swag Code box at the top of the homepage of Swagbucks.com HERE. Look for the circle with the words Swag Code next to it.

The patent, filed in October, would be the first of Walmart's (wmt) more than 800 patents and applications to focus on Internet of Things (IoT) and branches into shoppers' homes, CB Insights said. Walmart's system would require less effort than Amazon 's, a CB Insights blog post said. "While Dash buttons still require users to press a physical button separate from the product, Wal-Mart aims to integrate IoT into the products themselves for automatic re-ordering with no user input at all," the blog post said.

The company recently went on an e-commerce buying spree — snapping up Jet.com, ModCloth, MooseJaw, ShoeBuy, and possibly Bonobos — but will that be enough to compete with Amazon? Bloomberg recently published a piece detailing Walmart’s mission to beat Amazon, from experimenting with free shipping offers to establishing Jet.com’s Marc Lore as the e-commerce guru at the retailer. But in order to understand Walmart’s recent aggressive push toward online retail, you first have to understand the company’s back-and-forth with the entire concept. Bloomberg’s post includes a wealth of information on Walmart’s journey, but here are the six things we found interesting. 1. If At First You Don’t Succeed… Walmart’s first foray into online sales came in 2000 when the company spun out its website to a separate company, Bloomberg reports. But after a year and a half, Walmart bought back the online business. The result was disappointing sales and an over-abundance of inventory. The company had bet big that consumers would seek apparel online, when in reality it was all about electronics. In wake of this sad showing the company continued its focus on creating superstores and expanding its bricks-and-mortar footprint. 2. …Try, Try Again Bloomberg reports that Walmart once again jumped into the e-commerce ring in 2009 when it began a holiday price war with rival Amazon. The company also toyed with the idea of buying Lore’s first online retail juggernaut, Quidsi, but lost out to Amazon in the end. Instead, the company spent $300 million to buy a search engine, Kosmix. In 2012, Walmart hired Neil Ashe to increase the retailers online investment. The new team, Bloomberg reports rebuilt the tech used on Walmart.com, introduced smartphone apps, and were instrumental in building six fulfillment centers. 3. Not Everything Is For Online While Walmart steadily increased its online presence and sales, Bloomberg notes the company ran into issues, namely its promise of “Everyday Low Price.” While the promise worked in-store, it didn’t translate online. Executives worried that when prices online dropped below the price in-store, customers would leave the physical locations to shop online. Additionally, the company was hesitant to enter into a “marketplace” where third-party sellers could promote their products through Walmart’s online infrastructure. And so, the company went back to focusing on building its physical footprint, Bloomberg reports. 4. The Reckoning Bloomberg reports that when Doug McMillon took over in 2014, Walmart finally tuned its focus toward online. Under McMillon, Walmart has begun to follow the shifting retail landscape by closing hundreds of stores and looking for the next big idea online. The company also began playing with the idea of creating an Amazon Prime competitor — ShippingPass — that offered free two-day deliveries. “There was a realization that you have one shot to get that customer back in the door, so you better make sure you get it right.” Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. analyst Brandon Fletcher tells Bloomberg. “This is their last window to get it right.” 5. Coming Together Bloomberg notes that the Aug. 2016 deal between Jet.com and Walmart was mutually beneficial: Jet.com needed an influx of cash and Walmart needed a push to beat Amazon. Once the $3 billion deal was finished, Lore and his team took over all of Walmart’s e-commerce division. Since then the company has implemented a number of online strategies: It ditched ShippingPass in favor of offering free two-day shipping on millions of products with a lower minimum purchase price and began offering discounts on products ordered online but picked up in-store. Just last month, the company began testing in-store screens that let shoppers buy things online if they couldn’t find them while inside the big box store. The company has also worked to expand its reach by purchasing a handful of online retailers, including woman’s clothier Modcloth, shoe store ShoeBuy, outdoor retailer Moosejaw, and men’s fashion retailer Bonobos, although that deal has not been completed. 6. The Future Under Lore’s direction, Bloomberg reports, Walmart’s online activities will continue to evolve. For example, Lore is focusing on groceries by adding more stores to the company’s online ordering, in-store pickup process. The company has also been testing an in-store pick up tower that is meant to get online customers inside stores, with the thought that they might just pick up more items before heading home. Additionally, Lore is working to expand the Easy Reorder service, Bloomberg reports. The program takes everything you purchase in-store to your Walmart.com account. When you run out, you just go online click buy and the product would be ready to either ship or pick up at a local store. Of course, with every step Walmart takes to meet Amazon, Amazon takes one of its own, crowding into Walmart’s long-time advantages: physical stores. Amazon is currently prepping the launch of its Amazon Go stores, opening new bookstores, toying with the idea of opening a fleet of physical stores or just buying someone else’s.

Wednesday shortly after 7pm, Pasco police got a call about a trio of suspects seen leaving the store in a red van. LPO (loss prevention officers) at Walmart said the three had been tracked numerous times in the store, sometimes together, sometimes solo. At least seven times they were suspected of having stolen items from the store, then were returning them for cash or credit. Luckily, a Richland Police officer was in the area, and was able to respond and pull over the van. Upon investigation the Walmart LPO officials said the pair had pulled off this stunt at least seven times since April 14th, with the dollar amount exceeding $1.200. But the pair are now facing what police call Felony Layaway, or technically Organized Retail Theft. State law says if you’ve been stealing from the same store for an ongoing period and the value of the goods exceeds $750, then the charges become a felony. Javier Chavez Junior III, 30, and 29-year-old Dayana Bustos Ruelas are facing multiple felony counts and are now in the Franklin County Jail.  Police are still looking for the third suspect.   Filed Under: arrests | shoplifting | walmart Category: Business | crime | Newsletter | Tri-Cities News Share on Facebook Share on Twitter More Leave a comment Send to a friend!

Liza Zimmerman May 4, 2017 0shares 0shares Wal-Mart-owned wholesaler Sam's Club hopes that launching its own range of wines will shake up the US market and attract more people 'who like fine wine'. Credit: Sam's Club. TAGS: News Home In a move to cater to a higher-end demographics the Bentonville, Arkansas-based Sam’s Club, which is part of Wal-Mart, launched its first private label wine late last year and has now expanded the line-up. The brand now includes a Chardonnay, a Riesling, a Cabernet Sauvignon and a red blend. The reds were added this year and a sangria and a Prosecco are slated to be launched shortly. The current wine selection is priced between $7.98 to $10.48 for a 1.5-litree of the Mosel Riesling and is available in 37 markets. The wine brand launch is part of an overall relaunch of the chain’s “Member’s Mark,” line which includes everything from patio furniture to electronics. The target market is ‘people who like fine wine’, said Sam’s Club spokeswoman Dianna Gee. So, what next? The extension of the Member’s Mark line into wine has been seen as a play for market share of Costco’s Kirkland wine brand, but not everybody thinks it will succeed. There is ‘very little overlap between Sam’s and Costco, particularly because of their demographics’, said Barbara Insel, president and CEO of the Napa-based Stonebridge Research, a wine data analyst firm. She added that a couple of years ago, ‘The median household income for Costco’s customers was $110,000 versus $80,000 for Target and $55,000 for Wal-Mart. Sam’s Club is somewhat up on Wal-Mart but nowhere near Costco’s [average household income].’ Because of its ties to Wal-Mart—according to Insel—Sam’s has very different merchandising practices: Costco focuses on a smaller number of premium products, while Sam’s has large number of low-cost products. It has a ‘much more down-market demographic.’ As a result the trust of private label products that Costco’s customers have is unlikely to spread to Sam’s Club private label wine, she added. Not everyone was negative about the new wine label. ‘Sam’s dive into wine will be a positive for the industry,’ said sommelier Sean Beck of Houston’s Backstreet Café. ‘It’s encouraging an audience that has yet to ‎really embrace wine, hopefully making it a part of their daily life.’ More articles like this: US fine wine sales to rise in 2016 as overall market shrinks – forecast US fine wine sales will continue to increase in 2016, despite an expected decline in the overall wine market due… Latest wine consumption trends: US still rising Sales in the US set to rise further...

For the past six years, 39 employees known as “1387” from a local Fort Lauderdale area Wal-Mart have taken to raising dollars and awareness for the American Diabetes Association to extraordinary levels. Since 2011 “1387” has raised over $100,000 for cure. Diabetes runs deep with this group, as five of them currently live with this disease. They draw their passion and inspiration from each other as they raise money and work to educate the community. Their drive also comes in memory of one of their co-workers who passed away due to complications from diabetes. This passion was fueled because their co-worker who died did not know that he had diabetes and was a recent immigrant from Haiti. He did not have access to medical care or information in Creole.  His fate could have been avoided. Since his passing, this group has made it their mission to bring wellness and awareness to South Florida. In their store they coordinate with ADA staff to provide basic diabetes information quarterly during team meetings and have a healthy selection of diabetes materials visible in employee break areas. Going beyond they share and disseminate information within their community and to their families. A highlight of their work includes bringing ADA diabetes risk assessment brochures in Creole to the Haitian community. “Even if we can save one life, we have made a difference.  Our plan is to save as many as possible”, says Liz Mitchell. Through Step Out, team captains Liz Mitchell and Alix Story cultivate new team members each year to further their impact on the health of our community. With over 20 diabetes champions, they are also super-stars among the Fort Lauderdale Walk teams. They attend every Step Out event and are very proud of the work that they do at their churches, community programs, and within their neighborhoods to educate people and make their mark in the fight against diabetes.   Be Sociable, Share!

Prepaid debit cards are set up with a specific amount of money you load onto them, and they aren’t linked to your checking account. You use prepaid cards just like debit cards, which makes it easy to track your spending and keep tabs on your account balances. For many people, using reloadable prepaid cards helps curb excess spending and enables them to stick to a budget — especially when they use prepaid debit cards with no fees. Take a look at the six best prepaid debit cards. Before you decide if one is right for your finances, consider the pros and cons of prepaid cards. The Best Prepaid Debit Cards Prepaid Debit Card ATM Fees Card Loading Options Acceptance   Walmart MoneyCard $2.50 per transaction $0.50 per balance inquiry Mobile check deposit, add cash at Walmart register, online bank transfer, tax refunds Everywhere MasterCard or Visa debit cards are accepted   Green Dot Prepaid Card $2.50 withdrawal $0.50 balance inquiry Direct deposit, deposit a check, tax refunds, bank transfer, add at retailers and financial service centers Everywhere MasterCard or Visa debit cards are accepted   American Express Serve $0 at MoneyPass ATMs $2.50 at non-MoneyPass ATMs Direct deposit, mobile check deposit, transfer from a linked bank account, cash reloads Everywhere American Express card is accepted   PayPal Prepaid MasterCard $1.95 per withdrawal Direct deposit, PayPal instant transfers, NetSpend Reload Network, tax refunds Everywhere MasterCard debit card is accepted   AccountNow Prepaid Visa Card $2.50 per withdrawal $1.50 balance inquiry Direct deposit paycheck, tax refunds, add cash at 135,000 locations Everywhere Visa debit card is accepted   Western Union NetSpend Prepaid MasterCard $2.50 per withdrawal $0.50 per balance inquiry Direct deposit, Netspend ReloadNetwork, bank transfer, money transfer Everywhere MasterCard debit card is accepted Walmart MoneyCard If you want to get cash back benefits, consider this Visa prepaid card when you’re comparing reloadable prepaid cards. You’ll get 3 percent cash back when you shop on Walmart.com, 2 percent when you make purchases at Murphy USA or a Walmart fuel station, and 1 percent if you make purchases at a Walmart location. If you set up free direct deposit, you can get paid up to two days early without paying preload fees. If you’re a frequent Walmart shopper, you can load cash on your card and buy money orders at an in-store Walmart MoneyCenter Express. Read: Debit vs. Credit — The Wrong Payment Choice Can Cost You Hundreds of Dollars a Year Green Dot Prepaid Card You can get paid faster when you set up direct deposit, and you won’t be subject to any overdraft fees. You can earn 5 percent cash back up to $100 per year. Other incentives include a $25 reward when you set up a direct deposit for your tax refund and automatic entry into a weekly drawing to win a $5,000 payday bonus. Green Dot reports your payment and usage history to the three major credit bureaus, which can help you build credit if you pay on time. Related: 6 Times When Your Debit Card Is Better Than Your Credit Card American Express Serve American Express will approve you for a prepaid debit card without a credit check. You won’t have any minimum balance requirements, either, because this is one of the few free prepaid cards. You can withdraw cash for free at more than 24,000 MoneyPass ATM locations around the country and enjoy features such as free online bill pay, mobile account management, 24/7 live customer service and the ability to set up subaccounts. PayPal Prepaid MasterCard If you have a PayPal account, you can get a prepaid debit card for free. Order your card online and you won’t pay a purchase fee, or you can pick it up at a local reload center and pay $4.95. Enjoy benefits such as real-time text alerts that provide your balance and transaction information. You can also set up direct deposit at no extra cost and take advantage of special offers and cash back rewards. AccountNow Visa Prepaid Card Consider the AccountNow Visa prepaid debit card if you want to build your credit and save money on fees. There’s no credit check involved, and you can get a $15 direct deposit bonus. You can send money and pay your bills with this card. You won’t pay overdraft fees if you spend more than your debit balance, and the card includes the Visa Zero Liability policy, which provides fraud protection. Find Out: 5 Ways You Can Accidentally Set Off Your Own Fraud Alert Western Union NetSpend Prepaid MasterCard If you need to make money transfers and want a prepaid debit card with perks, consider the Western Union NetSpend Prepaid MasterCard. There’s no credit check involved, and you’ll be issued an account number instantly. You can set up direct deposit for your paycheck or government benefits and receive the funds two days faster than you would without direct deposit. In addition, you can get cash back and referral rewards — the Refer-a-Friend program earns you $20 for each friend or family member who loads at least $40 on a card. If you want maximum fraud protection when you shop online, request a virtual card.

It's called online grocery pickup and you may have heard of the concept at other area retailers like Giant Eagle. But now Walmart is getting in on the action. So here's how it works, similar to the concept at Giant Eagle, you go online to Walmart's website or download their free iPhone and Android app. Select your nearest Walmart store and reserve a time to pick up your order.  Then shop away. Select from over 30,000 items ranging from meat dairy and produce and much more. Once your order is complete, hit the check out button and voila. You pull up to the pick up area and you don't even need to get out of your car. The best part? it's all free of charge. One of the interesting things about Walmart's service is that the whole store is up for grabs when it comes to participating in the online grocery pick up program. Andrew says the only items they cannot deliver to your car are the sized merchandise and apparel like clothing. Anything else is fair game. Visit Walmart's website to get started.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Better Buy: Costco Wholesale Corporation vs. Amazon.com, Inc. In a battle for the future of retail, here's why the winner is clear as can be. Brian Stoffel (TMFCheesehead) May 4, 2017 at 8:00AM Back in 2011, we here at The Motley Fool put out a special free report called "The Death of Wal-Mart." The report detailed how two upstart players were challenging the dominant worldwide retailer. Those two are our focus today: Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Costco (NASDAQ:COST). It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that we nailed it with this report. Here's how the stocks of all three have fared since January of that year. Image source: Google Finance But we aren't talking today about Wal-Mart. We're focusing on whether Costco or Amazon is the better buy at today's prices. While we can't answer that question with 100% certainty, we can look at it through three different lenses. That may give us a clearer picture into what we're really buying and help a winner emerge. Sustainable competitive advantages In my opinion, this is the most important of the three sections we'll cover. Often referred to as a "moat" in investing circles, a company's sustainable competitive advantage is what separates it from everyone else. It is what keeps customers coming back year after year and keeps the competition at bay for decades. Costco's key moat is in the form of its scale. Believe it or not, if we look at the company's profit over the past five years, we'd see that more than all of it has been profit has come from membership dues.  Everything else the company simply sells at an operating loss. It's All About the Membership Dues Create column charts The brilliance of this business model can't be overemphasized. By lowering margin into potentially negative territory, Costco is just about guaranteed to have the lowest prices on bulk items. That draws more and more customers into the company's membership roster. The more members at Costco, the higher the sales, and the better the deals the company can procure from the vendors selling to the company -- thereby lowering prices even more. It's a virtuous cycle. Image source: Costco Amazon, on the other hand, relies on two major forces to provide its moat. The first also has to do with scale. Amazon has a network of 102 fulfillment centers in the United States, and 393 total. That means no customer is ever that far from a fulfillment center, meaning orders can be delivered faster than with any other global company. It would be prohibitively expensive for anyone to even challenge this moat. It would require hundreds of billions of infrastructure costs, and the competitor would still have to deal with Amazon at the end of the day. The second major moat is one of the most powerful forces in business today: the network effect. As Amazon Prime rosters have continued to swell -- exact numbers aren't available, but many estimate that it's north of 60 million stateside  -- third-party vendors have realized that by listing on Amazon's platform and paying for its fulfillment services, they get access to far more customers. That gives more people incentive to sign up for Amazon Prime, which leads to even more vendors. This, too, is a virtuous cycle. I have to give this category to Amazon. While Costco's moat is formidable, Amazon's momentum shows that it clearly has the upper hand in retail and is becoming the de facto platform for e-commerce. Winner: Amazon. Financial fortitude Both of these companies are uniquely attuned to macroeconomic trends. That means that when difficult economic times hit, they'll probably experience a notable drop in business. For that reason, cash on hand is important. While it's not as sexy as paying a dividend or reinvesting in growth initiatives, having a robust war chest is vital. Companies that enter difficult economic times with cash have options: buy back shares at a discount, acquire rivals, or -- conversely -- spend them into oblivion by grabbing market share. Those with lots of debt are in the opposite boat: They have few, if any, options. Remembering that Amazon is valued at almost six times the size of Costco, here's how these two stack up. Company Cash Debt Net Income Free Cash Flow Amazon $26 billion $8 billion $2.6 billion $10.2 billion Costco $4.7 billion $4.1 billion $2.4 billion $2.5 billion Data sources: SEC filings, Yahoo! Finance. On a net income and free cash flow basis, Costco has the stronger financials -- after adjusting for size. But much of that is because of Amazon's relentless pursuit of long-term dominance and reinvestment. The important thing is that both companies are solidly profitable. After that, I give the nod to the company with the stronger balance sheet. And on that respect -- with over three times more cash than debt -- Amazon is the clear winner. Winner: Amazon.  Valuation Finally, we have valuation. While we don't have a one-size-fits-all metric to compare any two companies, we can use multiple data points to make an informed analysis. Company P/E P/FCF PEG Ratio Dividend Yield FCF Payout Amazon 178 44 5.0 - - Costco 33 31 3.2 1.1% 31% Data sources: SEC filings, Yahoo! Finance. I believe that Costco is quite expensive relative to its growth prospects. But context matters, and in this context, Costco is going up against one of the most expensive stocks on the market. Indeed, it has a more favorable valuation on every metric -- and it offers a dividend. Winner: Costco. Our winner is... So there you have it: while Costco is the cheaper stock, Amazon has both a wider moat around the business and a stronger balance sheet. While it may never be a good time to back up the truck on an investment in the company, I suggest investors strongly consider taking a position in the e-commerce juggernaut if they haven't already. And my money is firmly where my mouth is, as shares of Amazon account for 20% of my real-life holdings. Brian Stoffel owns shares of Amazon.

(Courtesy | Walmart) Print Email Shandra Martinez | smartinez@mlive.com By Shandra Martinez | smartinez@mlive.com The Grand Rapids Press on May 04, 2017 at 7:00 AM, updated May 04, 2017 at 9:28 AM comments Walmart, the world's largest retailer, is looking for Michigan entrepreneurs to pitch their made in the USA products to the company's buyers in a daylong event in June.  The pitch session will be held at Walmart's headquarters in Bentonville, Ark. on June 28. The deadline to register at walmart-jump.com is May 18. The underlying goal is creating more U.S. jobs by stocking more American products on store shelves. "By investing in products that support American jobs, we are able to bring new products to our shelves that our customers want and new jobs to our communities," said Cindi Marsiglio, Walmart's vice president of U.S. Manufacturing, in a statement. "Increasing domestic manufacturing will help create additional jobs in the U.S., and that's good for American businesses." Walmart buyers will be looking to make deals of varying sizes ranging from supplying product to a handful of stores in a local market, to supplying hundreds or thousands of stores as well as Sam's Club locations and Walmart.com, the company said.  Michigan firm Carhart Products recently landed a deal with Walmart. The 15-person company in Saranac sells kids' tee ball sets made from recycled automotive plastic at 72 Walmart stores and on Walmart.com. "Our deal with Walmart gives us the potential to reach a national audience and take our company to the next level," said Dave Hartman, Carhart Products founder. "We have a lot of items we are working on now and hope to have in the stores and on Walmart.com soon. Our deal with Walmart was a game changer." In 2013, Walmart pledged to boost job creation and U.S. manufacturing by buying an additional $250 billion in products that support American jobs over 10 years. The program is an attempt to reverse the retailer's reliance on products made in China and other countries. While the sourcing has provided cheaper merchandise for consumers, the overseas sourcing has cost the U.S. economy manufacturing jobs.  Walmart's 10-year initiative is expected to create 1 million new U.S. jobs, according to the Boston Consulting Group. In Michigan, the retailer has a multi-billion dollar impact on the economy. Walmart's 118 Michigan stores employ 32,085 workers. It also spends $3 billion a year with vendors across the state, which support another 47,138 jobs, according to the retailer. Last year, Walmart also donated $26.5 million in cash and in-kind donations to local nonprofits across the state, the company said.

By: Reuters | New York | Published:May 4, 2017 8:04 am Wal-Mart has given feedback to federal agencies and will continue doing so and the company would also be open to speaking with state regulators about compliance, he said. Wal-Mart Stores Inc said on Wednesday it was considering getting certified under a new international program that could help companies defend themselves against isolated cases of corruption or poor business practices. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) developed the so-called anti-corruption compliance program and Wal-Mart is hoping to be the first U.S. company to get certified under it, said Jay Jorgensen, Wal-Mart’s executive vice president and global chief ethics and compliance officer. “We have begun looking for a company that would certify us,” Jorgensen told the Thomson Reuters Financial and Risk Summit in New York. The ISO is the world’s largest developer and publisher of international standards. Jorgensen added that Wal-Mart was interested in seeing the program develop in the United States, with the government laying out its own anti-corruption compliance framework or adopting ISO standards to help protect companies that follow it and defend themselves if something goes wrong. Jorgensen also shared a recent development in which federal agencies have contacted the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer about compliance programs. “Over the past couple of months … some of the federal agencies have reached out to say ‘hey do you have any feedback for us, anything we are doing is unreasonable?,'” Jorgensen said. Wal-Mart has given feedback to federal agencies and will continue doing so and the company would also be open to speaking with state regulators about compliance, he said. Jorgensen cited an example of how a broken baby shampoo bottle in California is treated as hazardous waste that retailers have to dispose off through an incinerator. “We would love it if California would say ‘hey we would like some feedback,” Jorgensen said. Jorgensen, who joined Wal-Mart in 2012, has been instrumental in revamping Wal-Mart’s compliance systems around the world and building a dedicated ethics and compliance team. That team has a staff of over 2,300, including over 500 in the United States and over 1,800 in international markets. Since 2013, Wal-Mart has invested more than $141 million in global ethics and compliance systems, Jorgensen said. More recently, Wal-Mart has created licensing teams that monitor the more than 56,000 licenses and permits Wal-Mart needs to operate in global markets using a centralized licensing system that reduces the error of wrongdoing and increases transparency, he said. For the last four years, the Wal-Mart board’s compensation committee has conditioned a portion of its most senior executives’ compensation on making adequate progress toward annual compliance goals. In its latest compliance report, Wal-Mart said it has achieved over 200 of these board-level objectives, including over 60 that relate specifically to its anti-corruption program. Wal-Mart’s ethics and compliance system came into focus after a New York Times report in 2012 found Wal-Mart had engaged in a multi-year bribery campaign to build its Wal-Mart de Mexico business. This was followed by an investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice into potential misconduct by Wal-Mart, including violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in some overseas markets including China, Brazil, India and Mexico. In October, Wal-Mart rebuffed a proposal by U.S. prosecutors to pay at least $600 million to settle a corruption probe into the company’s practices in markets including Mexico, India and China. So far Wal-Mart has spent about $800 million on legal fees and an internal investigation into the alleged payments and to revamp its compliance systems around the world.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: The Next Battleground for Amazon and Wal-Mart: The Unbanked A new fight for the wallets of millions of people who don't like or trust big financial institutions. Rich Duprey (TMFCop) May 3, 2017 at 7:44PM Few retailers have catered more to the unbanked than Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT). Whether it's a dislike of banks, a distaste for their fees, or some other reason, a sizable portion of U.S. households have chosen not to have a checking or savings account at a financial institution, and Wal-Mart has ensured they have a place to go. Through its 1,200 money centers, unbanked consumers can meet all of their banking needs at greatly reduced cost. From paying bills to wiring money here or abroad, Wal-Mart has made it cheap, easy, and convenient to bank without a bank. Now it's about to get some sizable competition from Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), which recently launched its Amazon Cash program that specifically targets this same subset of the population. Image source: Getty Images. Cashing out of banks According to the FDIC, some 9 million households, or 7% of all U.S. households, do not have an account at an insured institution. Moreover, almost 20% of households, or 24.5 million households in the country, are "underbanked" -- they have a checking or savings account, but also used other non-bank services for their banking needs. While conventional thinking has led us to believe that banks are the be-all, end-all of finance, it also shows that a huge swath of the population has a high level of distrust of or dissatisfaction with traditional financial institutions. Wal-Mart offered them a better option. It had once tried to enter the banking industry by applying for an industrial loan corporation charter, or ILC, that would have allowed it to establish a low-cost financial-services arm similar to ones that Target, GE, and others operate, but banks raised a hue and cry against Wal-Mart, and the retailer subsequently withdrew its application. Today, Wal-Mart helps the unbanked by offering an entire suite of financial services, which, in addition to the services mentioned earlier, also lets customers cash payroll and government checks, get prepaid debit cards, and print personal and business checks. Its Bluebird financial accounts, arranged through American Express, essentially allow customers to bank without a bank. Image source: Wal-Mart. Although these financial services total less than 1% of Wal-Mart's annual net revenues, that's still more than $4 billion worth of financial business being conducted, and it recently noted that the volume of money services transactions it's making can be measured "with a B." It's no wonder Amazon.com is looking to get in on the action. Cashing in on opportunity Amazon Cash isn't yet so grandiose as a Wal-Mart Money Center, but it is specifically targeted to the unbanked consumer and may provide a platform for future expansion. Amazon customers won't need a checking account to deposit between $15 and $500 in cash into an Amazon account. Instead, they can go to one of 10,000 retail stores from the likes of CVS, Speedway, Sheetz, and others and simply present a barcode from Amazon that they've either printed out or downloaded to a smartphone. There are also no fees to use the service. This is big because these are customers that have arguably been ignored previously by the e-tailer. Typically, you need a bank account to access Amazon services, and often it pays to be a Prime member. Not so with Amazon Cash, which is open to anyone. Image source: Getty Images. As Wal-Mart and Amazon continuously clash for retail dominance, every consumer becomes more valuable. By making its platform more accessible, Amazon can siphon off additional customers, and because Amazon Cash will be available both on smartphones and via analog means -- such as printing out a barcode -- the retailer is able to include the third of unbanked adults who don't yet have a smartphone. Start small, grow big Initially, it would seem Wal-Mart won't lose many customers to Amazon because money deposited at the e-commerce leader can only be spent on Amazon. Even PayPal, which has its own online cash service, is open to use at thousands of retailers, while Wal-Mart customers have an array of financial services available to them at its brick-and-mortar stores, and soon via mobile phone. Yet Amazon is only just tapping into this demographic. It's easy to see that if the unbanked increasingly use the service, Amazon will make more options available, including varied financial services. This is just the first skirmish between Amazon.com and Wal-Mart for the loyalty -- and wallets -- of the unbanked. It definitely won't be the last.

The charges come after a chaotic scene in Clarksville on April 23, where police said the bounty hunters shot at the four people in the sedan and chased them for seven miles. Not one of the men in the sedan was wanted on outstanding charges. In fact, the Clarksville bounty hunters were looking for someone else, and there is no indication that any of the victims fired at the defendants or were even armed, police spokesman Jim Knoll said in an email. Bail bondsmen are empowered to hire or act as bounty hunters to bring in people who violate the terms of jail bonds, but they can't use deadly force unless it's self-defense. This combo of booking photos released by the Clarksville, Tenn., Police Department shows, top row from left, William L. Byles, Kenneth Chiasson, Antwon D. Keesee and Jonathan Schnepp; bottom row from left, Roger D. West, Prentice L. Williams and Joshua Young. AP Killed was 24-year-old Jalen Johnson, a father of three from Clarksville. His family called him an innocent man who died in an act of terrorizing violence. Johnson's uncle, Toni Jenkins, told The Associated Press that his nephew and the three men in the car with him had no idea why people would suddenly block their car in the Wal-Mart parking lot. Fearing an attack by gang members, they tried to flee. The bounty hunters, Jenkins said, started shooting in the parking lot and continued to fire on them during the chase, even ramming the Nissan along the way. Clarksville police would not confirm or deny these details, but authorities have said they are troubled by how the bounty hunters put people at risk. The Montgomery County grand jury charged all seven men with first-degree felony murder, three counts of attempted second-degree murder, three counts of especially aggravated kidnapping, attempted especially aggravated kidnapping, four counts of aggravated assault, employing a firearm in commission of a dangerous felony and felony reckless endangerment, police said. Some of the men charged were bonding agents and others were strictly bounty hunters, Knoll said. The men charged include: William L. Byles, 31; Kenneth Chiasson, 38; Antwon D. Keesee, 32; Jonathan Schnepp, 31; Roger D. West, 31; Prentice L. Williams, 34 and Joshua Young, 27. They do not yet have court dates or attorneys listed, the Montgomery County Circuit Court Clerk's office said. All the men are from Clarksville, a city about 50 miles northwest of Nashville near the Kentucky state line. Topic U.S. news First Published May 4 2017, 10:40 am ET Next Story Florida Gov.

Economists partly blame the weather for March's 98,000 jobs. Retail jobs could continue to decline as brick-and-mortar stores close. Patti Domm | @pattidomm 7 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES Patrick T. Fallon | Bloomberg | Getty Images A customer signs for a purchase with a chip credit card at a Wal-Mart location in Burbank, California. Job growth in April is expected to have nearly doubled over last month's weak level — if indeed the real culprits behind March's sluggish hiring were weather and holidays. Economists forecast 185,000 nonfarm payrolls for April, up from a surprising 98,000 for March, according to Thomson Reuters. The unemployment rate is expected to rise to 4.6 percent from 4.5 percent, and average hourly wages are expected to grow by 0.3 percent, up from 0.2 percent in March. The employment report is released at 8:30 a.m. EDT Friday. March's slump was surprising after several months of strong growth, and the three-month average is 178,000, which many economists see as being close to trend growth. But economists disagree on how much of March's slump will be made up in April. show chapters ADP April payrolls up 177K    Wednesday, 3 May 2017 | 8:15 AM ET | 02:53 The April jobs report is the most significant second-quarter data after first-quarter GDP was reported to have grown by just 0.7 percent. Economists expect a bounce back in the second quarter and are looking for some signs of that in the payrolls. The report could also be important for the Fed, which indicated it viewed the first-quarter weakness as temporary. One negative trend that could continue to show up is the decline in retail-sector jobs, as brick-and-mortar retailers shut stores and go bankrupt. Diane Swonk, CEO of DS Economics, expects just 145,000 jobs, but she sees the trend more like 175,000. "There were a lot of retail closings, and this is the time when you tend to hire up, but you could have another retail loss," she said. Goldman Sachs economists said retail employment growth has fallen from a historical trend of 15,000 to 20,000 per month to an average decline of 5,000 over the past six months. "While some of the March weakness was likely weather-related, we expect the structural shift of retail sales from brick and mortar stores toward less labor-intensive e-commerce firms will continue to weigh on payroll growth in that industry, with the impact on the order of 10,000 per month, relative to its previous trend," the Goldman economists wrote. They said the drag from retail accelerated in the past two months — with a loss of 61,000 jobs — and that first-quarter sales trends at stores may be speeding up the shift. The Goldman Sachs economists forecast 200,000 nonfarm payrolls for April and expect a weather-related boost of between 25,000 and 40,000 as workers returned to work after March storms. They noted that payroll growth in the New England, mid-Atlantic and eastern north central regions went to a negative 52,000 in March, from a gain of 102,000 in February. They said that likely reflected the impact of snowstorms in March and some give back of jobs in sectors that hired during an unusually warm February. Barclays economists also expect to see a bounce back from weather. "We're forecasting 225,000. We looked at a lot of the underlying details last month, and I think there's a couple of factors that suggest we could see a pretty solid bounce in employment," said Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Barclays. Gapen said, for instance, there were big declines in the manufacturing states of Ohio, Pennsylvania and Missouri. "We had a big rise in [unemployment] claims in those states. The April claims data showed those states had some of the biggest declines," Gapen said. Gapen said the timing of the Easter and Passover holidays may also have been a factor. "We think that could be a factor in depressing, on a seasonally adjusted basis, some of the service-sector hiring," he said. "We also think construction, more broadly, had a weather effect." Swonk said the federal government's ongoing hiring freeze likely reduced public sector payrolls by 10,000 jobs. She also said uncertainty over the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, may also have resulted in a slowing in health-care hiring. "There was a slowdown in health care last month, and it's expected to slow again," she said. The House on Thursday voted to do away with Obamacare, but now the bill must pass the Senate, where it faces opposition. "The labor markets are getting tighter, but there's a risk that the jobs number could be disappointing a bit," she said. "We got fooled by the 200,000-plus months, and the reality is you have to do a moving average. We're still pretty much on trend."

AP , WFMY 6:07 PM. CDT May 04, 2017 There have been 24 homicides in the city of Winston-Salem in 2016 alone, which police say is “significantly” higher than usual. (Photo: Police line -- file photo, Custom) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Seven bounty hunters who descended on the wrong car outside a Wal-Mart have been indicted on first-degree murder charges in the killing of an unarmed man and the wounding of another, Tennessee police announced Wednesday. The charges come after a chaotic scene in Clarksville on April 23, where police said the bounty hunters shot at the four people in the sedan and chased them for seven miles. Not one of the men in the sedan was wanted on outstanding charges. In fact, the Clarksville bounty hunters were looking for someone else, and there is no indication that any of the victims fired at the defendants or were even armed, police spokesman Jim Knoll said in an email. Bail bondsmen are empowered to hire or act as bounty hunters to bring in people who violate the terms of jail bonds, but they can’t use deadly force unless it’s self-defense. Killed was 24-year-old Jalen Johnson, a father of three from Clarksville. His family called him an innocent man who died in an act of terrorizing violence. ►Make it easy to keep up to date with more stories like this. Download the WFMY News 2 App now. Johnson’s uncle, Toni Jenkins, told The Associated Press that his nephew and the three men in the car with him had no idea why people would suddenly block their car in the Wal-Mart parking lot. Fearing an attack by gang members, they tried to flee. The bounty hunters, Jenkins said, started shooting in the parking lot and continued to fire on them during the chase, even ramming the Nissan along the way. Clarksville police would not confirm or deny these details, but authorities have said they are troubled by how the bounty hunters put people at risk. The Montgomery County grand jury charged all seven men with first-degree felony murder, three counts of attempted second-degree murder, three counts of especially aggravated kidnapping, attempted especially aggravated kidnapping, four counts of aggravated assault, employing a firearm in commission of a dangerous felony and felony reckless endangerment, police said.

(NYSE: WMT) has done something different for its customers who have either a Walmart Credit Card or a Walmart Mastercard Credit Card. The world’s largest retailer is offering no-interest financing for periods of 6 or 12 months on card purchases. While this may sound like similar offers from lots of card issuers, what makes this different is that not only do Wal-Mart customers pay no interest during the promotional period, interest does not even accrue during the period. Most similar offers allow consumers to make interest-free payments for a specified period. Provided that the total bill is paid off within the period, the customer pays no interest charges. However, interest still accrues on the debt and if the full debt is not paid off in the specified period, the accrued interest is added to the bill. This can be a nasty surprise for many card holders. There are some limits to Wal-Mart’s offer: The new promotional financing offer on the Walmart Credit Card and the Walmart Mastercard Credit Card includes six months zero interest for purchases made in store of $150 to $298.99 and 12 months zero interest for purchases made in store of $299 or more. If you shop at Wal-Mart, this could be a deal worth checking out.

The patent, filed in October, would be the first of Wal-Mart's more than 800 patents and applications to focus on Internet of Things (IoT) and branches into shoppers' homes, CB Insights said. Wal-Mart's system would require less effort than Amazon's, a CB Insights blog post said. "While Dash buttons still require users to press a physical button separate from the product, Wal-Mart aims to integrate IoT into the products themselves for automatic re-ordering with no user input at all," the blog post said.

Sign up here. In a second showdown over the Obamacare repeal, the House narrowly passed a revised bill with a 217-213 vote. The dramatic do-or-die vote on the embattled bill chalks up a legislative victory for President Trump after weeks of uncertainty, furious lobbying, and an embarrassing defeat when the first vote was scrapped. The bill in its current form now faces a tough road in the Senate. (We’re tracking all major policy changes to the GOP’s health plan and their impacts here.) House Republicans joined the president at a celebration after the vote in the White House Rose Garden, where Trump proclaimed: “Your premiums are going to start to come down.” —Katie Robertson Senate GOP plans its own Obamacare repeal bill. The Senate has made it clear it will revise the narrowly passed health-care bill. Several key Republicans have said they will set aside the the bill and write their own version instead, a sign of how difficult it will be to deliver on seven years of promises to repeal Obamacare. To get some kind of bill through his chamber, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell will need to unite moderate and conservative wings of the party that want to pull the measure in entirely different directions. Boeing’s China rival is mounting its boldest challenge yet. The nation’s first modern large jet is expected to make its maiden flight on Friday after years of delays. The C919 plane, which was built by Comac using a string of Western suppliers, is China’s biggest attempt yet to break the stranglehold that Boeing and Airbus have on the market for big commercial airlines. The retail crisis could be coming to American groceries. Supermarkets have so far been mostly immune to the ravages of online shopping and the all around apocalyptic outlook facing the nation’s retailers. That may change when Lidl, a German retailer known for low prices and efficient operations, starts an aggressive U.S. expansion. The cut-throat competition comes during an historic bout of food deflation. Can Wal-Mart’s expensive new e-commerce operation compete with Amazon? The big-box retailer’s primary rival already dominates the cities and coasts, and it’s next stop is the heartland, home to Wal-Mart’s customer base. But a recent acquisition spree, including Jet.com, may have given Wal-Mart much-needed digital chops to catch up. Apple buys more company debt than the world’s biggest bond funds. Like many tech companies, the iPhone-maker has resisted transferring the money it earns abroad back to the U.S. to avoid triggering corporate income taxes on the earnings. Instead, it now has $148 billion of its record $257 billion cash pile invested in corporate debt alone. How did the Kremlin-funded RT channel get so powerful? U.S. intelligence officials have accused the little-watched Russian cable network of helping swing the election to Trump. RT’s coverage of U.S. politics and the war in Syria may well offer a window into the Kremlin’s PR strategy, but if the network’s largely young, left-wing journalists work on behalf of the Russian state, they hardly seem aware of it.

Woman who lost 185lbs posts candid images of her excess skin to help people 'realize what obesity does' Illinois woman Jessica Weber, 23, was tipping the scales at 383 lbs when she decided she needed to turn her life around Through the help of a low-carb, high-fat diet, she lost a staggering 185 lbs in just 15 months, leaving her with pounds of excess skin Instead of concealing her body, she decided to show off her new form in an effort to spread awareness about what obesity can lead to  By Valerie Siebert For Dailymail.com Published: 16:42 EDT, 4 May 2017 | Updated: 17:06 EDT, 4 May 2017 e-mail 11 View comments A woman who went through a remarkable weight-loss journey is baring her body to show the real effects of obesity. Jessica Weber, 23, of Illinois was at 383 lbs when she finally decided to lose weight after an emotional conversation with her mother, who was terrified that she might outlive her own daughter. The humbling realization became Jessica's motivation to get healthy, and eventually helped her shed more than 185 lbs in just 15 months. Quite a journey: Illinois Walmart associate Jessica Weber, 23, lost 185 lbs in just 15 months Putting it out there: She managed the remarkable transformation through a low-carb, high-fat diet She achieved this feat by sticking to a low-carb, high-fat diet, which she described to People as 'a constant struggle'. But now, weighing in at just under 200 lbs, the excess skin she always knew would be a problem, has turned into a daily struggle. 'I’ve seen some people lose weight and have it not be such a problem, but I wasn’t that lucky,' said the Walmart associate. But the difference between many with the same struggle and Jessica, is that she decided to do something bigger by taking her insecurities and broadcasting them online - in the hopes that her story might help someone else. Telling the truth: She has gained thousands of fans on social media for baring her excess skin in an effort to show people the true effects of obesity  All hopes: Jessica said that while some people were able to avoid too much excess skin in weight loss, 'I wasn’t that lucky' Not for everyone: Jessica was driven to lose weight after a heartbreaking conversation with her mother  Loving her look: Jessica regularly pens defiant, inspiring posts, telling her followers that 'I will not hate my body anymore' She began posting images of herself baring her body, excess skin and all, to help people 'realize what obesity does.'  'They can make changes, but they’ll also face problems with loose skin in all areas,' she said. 'I want people to not be scared, or feel hidden of what they accomplished after weight loss!' In one powerful post uploaded to Instagram two weeks ago, Jessica shared a pair of photos of herself in front of a mirror, one mostly clothed and the other baring the loose skin around her stomach. Need to know: She decided to bare her belly on camera in the hopes it would help people 'realize what obesity does' All in: Jessica was initially 'extremely nervous' about posting her photos, but was met with overwhelming support Almost there: She is currently in the process of losing the last 38-48 lbs before getting a tummy tuck 'This is my reality! This is my life! When you lose 180 pounds, the skin doesn't just suck back up!' she wrote.  'I have been learning to deal with it, even with wanting to lose a bit more weight and have surgery! This is my life until then and I will not hate my body anymore!'  The first time she shared a photo fully showing the results of her weight loss, she was 'extremely nervous', but was relieved when she was met with incredible support and praise. The reaction has encouraged her to continue sharing images of her progress, as she works towards losing the last 38-48 lbs needed before she will go for a tummy tuck.

EDT May 04, 2017 There have been 24 homicides in the city of Winston-Salem in 2016 alone, which police say is “significantly” higher than usual. (Photo: Police line -- file photo, Custom) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Seven bounty hunters who descended on the wrong car outside a Wal-Mart have been indicted on first-degree murder charges in the killing of an unarmed man and the wounding of another, Tennessee police announced Wednesday. The charges come after a chaotic scene in Clarksville on April 23, where police said the bounty hunters shot at the four people in the sedan and chased them for seven miles. Not one of the men in the sedan was wanted on outstanding charges. In fact, the Clarksville bounty hunters were looking for someone else, and there is no indication that any of the victims fired at the defendants or were even armed, police spokesman Jim Knoll said in an email. Bail bondsmen are empowered to hire or act as bounty hunters to bring in people who violate the terms of jail bonds, but they can’t use deadly force unless it’s self-defense. Killed was 24-year-old Jalen Johnson, a father of three from Clarksville. His family called him an innocent man who died in an act of terrorizing violence. Johnson’s uncle, Toni Jenkins, told The Associated Press that his nephew and the three men in the car with him had no idea why people would suddenly block their car in the Wal-Mart parking lot. Fearing an attack by gang members, they tried to flee. The bounty hunters, Jenkins said, started shooting in the parking lot and continued to fire on them during the chase, even ramming the Nissan along the way. Clarksville police would not confirm or deny these details, but authorities have said they are troubled by how the bounty hunters put people at risk. The Montgomery County grand jury charged all seven men with first-degree felony murder, three counts of attempted second-degree murder, three counts of especially aggravated kidnapping, attempted especially aggravated kidnapping, four counts of aggravated assault, employing a firearm in commission of a dangerous felony and felony reckless endangerment, police said. Some of the men charged were bonding agents and others were strictly bounty hunters, Knoll said. The men charged include: William L. Byles, 31; Kenneth Chiasson, 38; Antwon D. Keesee, 32; Jonathan Schnepp, 31; Roger D. West, 31; Prentice L. Williams, 34 and Joshua Young, 27. They do not yet have court dates or attorneys listed, the Montgomery County Circuit Court Clerk’s office said. All the men are from Clarksville, a city about 50 miles (80 kilometers) northwest of Nashville near the Kentucky state line. © 2017 Associated Press CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST JOIN THE CONVERSATION To find out more about Facebook commenting please read the Conversation Guidelines and FAQs Leave a Comment TRENDING VIDEOS Killfies Man arrested for homicide Weather at 11, April 25 Man Shot and Killed in Virginia Beach Stealthing epidemic Messer denied bond in the death of his son Family pleads for pleading for information that could assist in the investigation into the murders of their loved Athlete of the Week: Western Branch's Ben Holtzclaw Fix the flooding issues!

The store is one of several in the Chicago area that this week started offering free online grocery shopping with curbside pickup. Susan Sarkauskas | Staff Photographer   Susan Sarkauskas Follow @dh_ssarkauskas     With a fanfare, the Batavia Wal-Mart Thursday joined hundreds of other Wal-Marts nationwide in offering shoppers free online grocery shopping. "I'm so excited!," said its first customer, Margie Goliak of Batavia, the first to pick up an order, at 9:10 a.m. Goliak learned of the service several days ago in an email blast the Batavia Chamber of Commerce sent to members. "I was like, 'This is genius!' " she said. She fit into one of the categories store manager Cory Ringler spoke of, in an opening ceremony: Busy working mother. Goliak owns a home-based wine consulting business. Shoppers have to order a minimum of $30 worth of items. "It's not like we don't want you coming into the store," said BethAnn Jacobs of Batavia, department manager for online grocery. The store still hopes you will come in to visit the optician or for other services. But you can save time on the routine shop-and-get-dinner-on-the-table chore, she said: Place your order before you leave work, let the Wal-Mart workers do the shopping, swing by to pick it up. Store workers load the groceries into your car. Ringler said he expects the service may be popular with older shoppers, since they won't even have to get out of their cars. Wal-Mart is not the first store to offer a shopping service. Meijer experimented with it several years ago but it's not offered in this area. Peapod.com offers home delivery or pickup at regional posts. Jewel-Osco has Instacart.com service at some Chicago stores. Amazon.com delivers groceries to its AmazonPrime members. Those services charge a fee, although some are discounted depending on how much you order. The Batavia store, at 801 N. Randall Road, is one of 10 in the Chicago area that debuted the service this week. Other stores are in Johnsburg, Crystal Lake, Lockport, Montgomery, Plainfield, Gurnee, Wheeling, St. Charles and Woodstock. Wal-Mart began testing the service in 2014. It is available at more than 600 stores.

Introduced with just a week left in the legislative session, the measure would revisit last year’s massive overhaul of the state’s alcohol laws just months after its provisions began to take effect. It would allow liquor stores to expand to up to nine locations over 10 years. Under the law passed last year, they are allowed to operate a total of four locations by that year, starting with one new location this year. The proposal also would clarify that Walmart and Target can obtain up to 20 liquor licenses each over a 20-year period. That would put the big-box giants on a level playing field with grocery chains that won similar allowances in last year’s hotly debated measure. On Wednesday, the measure narrowly passed out of the House Finance Committee, 7-6, over deep reservations of lawmakers in both parties who said the legislation was moving too quickly and too late in the legislative session. Alcohol-related bills are always among the most contentious and heavily lobbied at the Colorado statehouse. And, in an unusual wrinkle, this year’s debate has split the state’s powerful liquor lobby, exposing the competing motivations of large outfits such as Applejack Wine and Spirits in Wheat Ridge that may want to expand, and owners of smaller shops who fear that allowing liquor stores to expand will drive Colorado’s mom-and-pop stores out of business. “The minute you pass a bill that allows the expansion of liquor stores at the rapid pace that this legislation allows, you will have an arms race to see who can build the biggest and who can build the fastest,” said Jeanne McEvoy, CEO of the Colorado Licensed Beverage Association, which represents 1,600 liquor stores around the state. “And the little guy is going, ‘What can I do now?’ ” McEvoy and other opponents say the bill would gut the bipartisan compromise reached last year that overhauled the state’s Prohibition-era alcohol laws. The law allows grocery stores to gradually add new locations selling full alcohol over 20 years, starting this year, if they meet certain conditions, such as buying out the liquor licenses of competitors within a certain radius. The old law had limited each chain to a single location in the state. Meanwhile, because Walmart is subject to different regulations than grocery stores, it was inadvertently exempt from last year’s changes. Target may have been as well. Lawmakers earlier this year attempted to rectify that, calling it an oversight, but that effort was defeated in the state Senate by a single vote after a contentious debate.

Now it’s about to become state law. May 3, 2017 Colorado lawmakers send budget bill to governor with reservations The last-minute fight over House Bill 1370 — sponsored by Rep. Faith Winter, D-Westminster, and Rep. Larry Liston, R-Colorado Springs — promises much of the same on a tight timeline. The bill was introduced Tuesday and scheduled for a Finance Committee hearing less than 24 hours later. The debate on the measure Wednesday reflected divisions that don’t fall neatly along party lines. Liston argued that further changes to last year’s law were needed, saying that liquor stores continue to enjoy a near-monopoly on alcohol sales and that the market activity lawmakers had hoped to see hadn’t occurred. “Right now, the market is stuck,” he said. “A year later, there’s been zero transactions.” Liston’s comments drew a swift rebuke from his fellow Republican, Rep. Polly Lawrence, who said the law hadn’t been given a chance to work. “We said this needed to be a phased-in approach, because a lot of these stores are a lifetime investment for a lot of the smaller stores,” Lawrence said. Grocery stores could begin applying for new alcohol permits Jan. 1. But the process for doing so is complicated, requiring grocers to buy out the alcohol licenses of competitors nearby. Josh Phair, a Walmart public affairs official, said that right now, both buyers and sellers are cautious of making a sale in an uncertain market. “Nobody wants to be the first one to pay too much or have sold for too little,” Phair said. The committee chairman, Rep. Dan Pabon, D-Denver, cited consumer choice in voting to expand sales. “At the end of the day, we also represent the consumers, and the conversations that we’ve always had is that consumers should have as many choices as they can have,” he said. In unusually pointed criticism, lawmakers chastised lobbyists on both sides for the frenzy of texts, phone calls and emails they received late into the night. Some of them, the committee members said, came across as vitriolic and threatening. “What happened with this bill was not OK,” said Rep. Dafna Michaelson Jenet, D-Commerce City. “I hope that the interaction from the lobby from this point will be different.” And with supporters hesitant to offer full-throated support of such a far-reaching measure this late in the session, its prospects of passage are uncertain. “My patience is very thin with this bill,” said Rep. Kevin Van Winkle, R-Highlands Ranch, who voted for it. “Time is very short.” Tags:  liquor Target Walmart Brian Eason Statehouse reporter Brian Eason joined The Post from the Indianapolis Star, where he covered city hall for the news outlet's watchdog team beginning in 2014.

Two Colorado educators spent months crafting a piece of legislation. Now it’s about to become state law. May 04, 2017, 6:37 am Teachers show up at the statehouse all the time while Colorado lawmakers are debating education policy.

Amorosi Share This Article LinkedIn Email Print Talk Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP/REX/Shutterstock May 4, 2017 | 10:00AM PT Powerhouse vocalist Patti LaBelle has been an R&B musical icon for so long (55 years since her debut single) that, even when she’s veered into other entertainment territories and business opportunities, they have soul. “Now you know that’s just how I roll,” says LaBelle with a sly laugh from her Wynnewood home in the suburbs of her native Philadelphia. From good-girl-group pop to wanton pre-disco funk (The Bluebelles trio, which eventually became LaBelle, the women behind “Lady Marmalade”), from her role as the silken matron of Gamble & Huff’s “Sound of Philadelphia,” to synth-pop goddess (“New Attitude”), from R&B balladeer to Broadway belter (“After Midnight” and “Fela!”), LaBelle has sung it and wrung every emotion from it. She’s even recorded a holiday album, 2007’s “Miss Patti’s Christmas” (Def Soul Classics), which wound up as her last record until now. There is only one sound that LaBelle has never recorded during this long career. She takes care of that on May 5 when she releases “Bel Hommage,” a jazz covers album executive produced by her ex-husband Armstead Edwards (“he’s known me and my voice for over 30 years, so why not?” she says of the musical marriage) on a new label (GPE Records) she co-owns with their son and her manager, Zuri Edwards of Edwards Entertainment. “I have been telling people — press, friends, business associates — about my jazz album for so long with nothing to show for it, I bet they thought I was lying,” she said. Anyone who has followed LaBelle’s career during the last decade knows that she’s had other work and career opportunities on her mind. “That’s exactly what they were: opportunities that came my way. I’m too shy to hustle or push. I am, however, smart enough to know what is good, right, and of high quality. My son is sharp and intuitive and he knows, too, but he can only push me so much. If and when I want to do something, I do it.” LaBelle has become a culinary household name for her Good Life foods imprint with Walmart, starting with the famed “Patti LaBelle Sweet Potato Pie,” which got a massive jump in sales when mega-fan James Wright posted a YouTube video of his initial tasting. From there, every new pie and dessert item from LaBelle’s Walmart deal has been nothing but cake. Speaking of sweets, the diabetic LaBelle just published her fourth cookbook, “Desserts LaBelle: Soulful Sweets to Sing About,” which partially focuses on sugar-free morsels. She is also currently putting the finishing touches on her third season of the Cooking Channel’s “Patti LaBelle’s Place.” Other television gigs, though, have proven to be even more visible. LaBelle has appeared on her Philadelphia producer-director Lee Daniels’ (“he’s my baby”) Fox hip hop drama, “Empire,” with another go-round to follow shortly, as well as a role in Daniels’ other music-related soap opera, “Star.” “He’s always got me in mind when he’s writing,” she says of Daniels. Then there’s producer-director Ryan Murphy, whose “American Horror Story: Freak Show” featured LaBelle in a death scene so horrid, “I don’t think he could write me back into anything I died so hard,” she laughs. Music, jazz in particular, remains her first and truest love, so much so that when her ex-husband suggested that she record her jazz favorites, she jumped at the process, even though — at the time — she wasn’t completely confident in her vocal abilities. “I just didn’t like how I sounded. My voice wasn’t being kind to me. I knew I could be better. I didn’t think I could do it, but Armstead said ‘Blanche’ — that’s his nick name for me and my drama — ‘I know you have it in you.’ So I did it, and was in it to win it. Now, it sounds more beautiful than I ever imagined.” LaBelle goes on to say that she fought with Edwards throughout the entire “Bel Hommage” recording process, “even when I knew he was right, just to stir thing up. There’s a lot of laughs, joy, and pain in that album.” “Bel Hommage” allows LaBelle to be more nuanced and intimate than she normally gets the chance to be on the tender Tony De Vita/Giorgio Calabrese song, “Softly as I Leave You,” Shirley Horn’s quietly theatrical “Here’s to Life,” and the brassy, big-band tones of Gloria Lynne’s “The Jazz in You.” Most particularly haunting, though, are several signature numbers from the late Nina Simone’s songbook such as “Don’t Explain,” “Wild Is the Wind,” and “Go to Hell.” Not only was Simone one of LaBelle’s favorite songwriters (“her tunes make you feel like you’re floating”) and performers, the two were old pals, as illustrated by a story LaBelle told about her friend. “We did a rainforest benefit for Sting at Carnegie Hall and I get there, backstage, just in time to hear that Nina wasn’t going on stage until I cooked for her. That’s my thing. So got kielbasa, spicy too, and made sure she had brown bread and mustard to go with it — she’s not eating it otherwise. They brought us red wine in plastic red cups, and before I took one sip she yelled, ‘don’t ever drink wine out of plastic! Get us crystal!’ She taught me to be a lady. I loved her and could have made this album all Nina songs. Maybe next time.” There will be a next time, too. LaBelle claims to have several albums finished for GPE, including a gospel album, a dance-music album, and an album featuring the new first songs penned by fellow Philadelphians Kenneth Gamble and Leon Huff — the principles behind Philadelphia International Records — in decades, a fact confirmed by Gamble himself. “When Patti calls, I listen, and we wrote some beautiful numbers just for her,” he said on the 2016 occasion of Gamble, Huff, and LaBelle winning the prestigious Marian Anderson Award. “This is like a new beginning for me,” says LaBelle of “Bel Hommage,” “new, but still an old friend.” Filed Under: Bel Hommage Patti Labelle Want to read more articles like this one?

To fuel growth, the fashion world is increasingly counting on plus-size customers, a demographic that it has long ignored. Quotes in the article Wal-Mart Stores Inc WMT ▲ 76.34 +0.58 +0.77% Michael Kors Holdings Ltd KORS ▲ 37.51 +0.33 +0.89% Hennes & Mauritz AB HMRZF ▲ 24.65 +0.19 +0.78% JC Penney Co Inc JCP ▼ 5.38 -0.11 -2.00% According to market researcher NPD Group, sales of women's plus-size clothing (defined as size 12 and above) rose 6 percent to $21.4 billion in 2016, double the rate of overall apparel sales. By 2020, revenue in the category could hit $24 billion, though Ascena Retail, the parent of plus-size chain Lane Bryant, argues that the "true opportunity" in the market may be as much as $53 billion, depending on how it's measured. Many in the fashion world have gotten the message that bigger is better, or they may be paying attention to research that has found the average American woman now wears a size 16 or 18, equal to a plus size 20w. Walmart in March unveiled plans to acquire independent online retailer ModCloth,  which the retail giant described as a pioneer in the fashion industry on issues of "size diversity, lifestyle inclusiveness, and body positivity over the last decade." Walmart didn't disclose the deal's price. Designers including Michael Kors and Christian Siriano featured "a range of body types on their fall runways," while H&M included "shapely models" Kate Syme and Stela Duval in its collections, according to Women's Wear Daily. Designer Prabal Gurung, whose clients include Oprah Winfrey among others, recently announced plans for a limited collection to be sold at Lane Bryant. Earlier this year, sports apparel giant Nike began selling plus-size workout clothes. Retailer JCPenney last year unveiled its Boutique + collection for millennials in conjunction with "Project Runway" winner Ashley Nell Tipton. The Plano, Texas-based company plans to further expand its plus-size line this year with swimwear and other accessories. Big-box chain Target unveiled its Aba and Vin collection in 2015. According to a report from McKinsey & Co., the number of mentions of "plus size" in the fashion press tripled in 2016 compared with the previous year. The trend shows no signs of slowing. "Fashion brands are rapidly responding to a cultural shift toward body positivity and a growing appreciation of curvy figures, by designing specifically for a larger range of sizes rather than just expanding their size range as an afterthought," the report said. However, traditional retailers such as Ascena, which also owns Catherines plus-size chain, will face tough competition from both brick-and-mortar stores and online rivals such as Amazon. Comparable-store sales, a key retail metric measuring activity at existing locations, has fallen at Ascena's Lane Bryant and Catherines as foot traffic declined. An Ascena spokesperson couldn't immediately be reached. Men's big and tall fashions are also selling well at a time when large apparel chains such as Gap are struggling to attract customers. Destination XL, the largest specialty retailer of big and tall fashions for men, reported positive comparable-store sales in three out of four quarters last year, which analyst Greg Pendy of Sidoti & Co. called "impressive relative to the overall industry." He rates the stock a "buy." Helping the chain's results have been strong demand from so-called "end of rack" customers with waistlines of between 38 inches to 46 inches, sizes that can be difficult to find at many retailers. Pendy said, "That's been a bright spot for Destination XL to capture that opportunity." Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

Byles, Kenneth Chiasson, Antwon D. Keesee and Jonathan Schnepp; bottom row from left, Roger D. West, Prentice L. Williams and Joshua Young.  Clarksville Police Department via AP Comment Share Tweet Stumble Email NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- Seven bounty hunters who descended on the wrong car outside a Wal-Mart have been indicted on first-degree felony murder charges in the killing of an unarmed man and the wounding of another, Tennessee police announced Wednesday. The charges come after a chaotic scene in Clarksville on April 23, where police said the bounty hunters shot at the four people in the sedan and chased them for seven miles. Jalen Johnson WTVF Not one of the men in the sedan was wanted on outstanding charges. In fact, the Clarksville bounty hunters were looking for someone else, and there is no indication that any of the victims fired at the defendants or were even armed, police spokesman Jim Knoll said in an email. Bail bondsmen are empowered to hire or act as bounty hunters to bring in people who violate the terms of jail bonds, but they can't use deadly force unless it's self-defense. Killed was 24-year-old Jalen Johnson, a father of three from Clarksville. His family called him an innocent man who died in an act of terrorizing violence. Johnson's uncle, Toni Jenkins, told The Associated Press that his nephew and the three men in the car with him had no idea why people would suddenly block their car in the Wal-Mart parking lot. Fearing an attack by gang members, they tried to flee. The bounty hunters, Jenkins said, started shooting in the parking lot and continued to fire on them during the chase, even ramming the Nissan along the way. Clarksville police would not confirm or deny these details, but authorities have said they are troubled by how the bounty hunters put people at risk. The Montgomery County grand jury charged all seven men with first-degree felony murder, three counts of attempted second-degree murder, three counts of especially aggravated kidnapping, attempted especially aggravated kidnapping, four counts of aggravated assault, employing a firearm in commission of a dangerous felony and felony reckless endangerment, police said. Some of the men charged were bonding agents and others were strictly bounty hunters, Knoll said. The men charged include: William L. Byles, 31; Kenneth Chiasson, 38; Antwon D. Keesee, 32; Jonathan Schnepp, 31; Roger D. West, 31; Prentice L. Williams, 34 and Joshua Young, 27. They do not yet have court dates or attorneys listed, the Montgomery County Circuit Court Clerk's office said. All the men are from Clarksville, a city about 50 miles northwest of Nashville near the Kentucky state line. © 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 4 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Always Discreet® Launches Campaign with Walmart to Inspire Women with Bladder Leaks to Live Life Without Shame or Compromise CINCINNATI–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Embarrassed. Old. Frustrated. These negative feelings are just a few of the most common ways women describe how they feel about having bladder leaks. In order to help normalize the topic of bladder leaks, Always Discreet® is working with retailers to educate women nationwide. As an example, today, Procter & Gamble’s Always Discreet brand has worked with Walmart to launch a new, inspirational video to help women understand how common bladder leaks are and to rethink their negative feelings. Click here to watch the video and see the emotional responses women had when it came to talking about their bladder leaks: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySYOFGGAGo4 As the new, compelling video demonstrates, one out of three women over the age of 18 experience bladder leaks, but a new national survey from Always Discreet shows more than half (57 percent) of women who are 45 and older and experience bladder leaks are embarrassed to talk about it. The new survey also reveals that nearly half (48 percent) of these women currently do not to talk to anyone about their bladder leaks, including nearly a third (32 percent) of women who avoid talking about it even with their doctors. In fact, more than 60 percent of women would surprisingly rather talk about their weight or their political opinions. However, more than 70 percent of women agree that women would be more comfortable talking about bladder leaks if they knew that one in three women experience them too. Always Discreet, with Walmart, is on a mission to help women let go of the discouraging feelings they have about themselves, their bodies and incontinence by comforting and reassuring them that they’re not alone. “Because many women avoid talking about their bladder leaks, they can often feel alone in their experience, embarrassed to bring up the topic, and hesitant to shop for and wear incontinence products,” said Barbara Hannah Grufferman, positive living expert, author and Always Discreet spokesperson. “Over the years, I’ve spoken to thousands of women around the country who have bladder leaks, and most women don’t realize how common and normal it is. The good news is that once women realize how many other women experience it too, they feel better about it and themselves. That’s what’s been captured in this video, and the hope is that women watch it, make that connection for themselves and feel more confident, empowered and compelled to live their best lives and stand in solidarity with the many other women who experience bladder leaks too.” The new Always Discreet survey also revealed: Three-quarters of women (75 percent) are generally comfortable talking about almost anything with other women, but nearly three in five women say bladder leaks are embarrassing to talk about. Four in 10 women agree that bladder leaks are a taboo topic in our society. Over half (53 percent) of women who experience bladder leaks would be less embarrassed about their leaks if they knew one in three women have bladder leaks. Since 2014, Always Discreet has helped to increase the number of women using the right bladder protection from one in nine to one in seven. Through this new campaign, Always Discreet, with Walmart, continues to end the stigma surrounding bladder leaks and inspires women to not hold back, let their negative feelings go and live their best life with the right protection. For additional information on Always Discreet please visit www.alwaysdiscreet.com. Survey Methodology The Always Discreet Study was conducted by MSLGROUP Research and surveyed a total of 622 women aged 45 years or older who experience bladder leaks. The online survey was implemented between the dates of April 20, 2017 through April 25, 2017.

On April 27, Petty Officer 1st Class Roger Brown had just paid for his items at the store and was approaching the exit when he heard a scuffle nearby. Two officers were wrestling with a man who had pinned one of the officers to the ground and was punching him in the face. “It took me a second or two to realize what was happening,” said Brown. “Then I kicked off my flip-flops, threw my keys and my groceries down, and took action.” One of the officers had recognized the suspect, 32-year-old Clinton Pickens, as a suspect in the burglaries of five local businesses between April 19 and 25. The officer first spoke to Pickens until another officer arrived to help arrest him. That’s when the fight broke out. “As soon as the second officer got there, the suspect became violent and started assaulting the first officer,” said Detective Misty Holley, public information officer with the Portsmouth Police Department. “He became extremely aggressive.” Brown was able to pull the suspect off the officer and help the officers pin him down. Another Good Samaritan also assisted to help restrain the suspect’s legs while officers handcuffed him. Detective Holley said both the good Samaritan and Brown were instrumental in subduing the suspect and minimizing the police officer’s injuries. “The officer sustained minor facial injuries and bruising,” Holley said. “If Petty Officer Brown and the other good Samaritan hadn’t reacted so quickly, it could have ended up much worse.” Unfortunately, the Good Samaritan has not been identified. Brown, who has served in the Coast Guard since 2003, said he originally joined looking for a change and a way to find direction in his life. While he now works as an electronics technician and provides technical support for Coast Guard cutter navigation systems, Brown previously served as a boarding team member aboard the 210-foot Cutter Resolute out of St. Petersburg, Florida. During his tour aboard the Resolute, Brown participated in law enforcement missions as a boarding team member and underwent countless hours of tactical training – training he said came into play during his scuffle with Pickens. “It’s been a while since I’ve used those techniques,” he said. “But you never forget them.” But Brown said you don’t need tactical training to come to the aid of police officers or other people in trouble: you just need to act quickly and do what you can. “You’ve got to look out for your local law enforcement members,” said Brown. “You never know when you’re going to need their assistance in return. It all comes back around full circle.” 36.835426 -76.298274 Filed in: News Topics: Coast Guard, U.S. Coast Guard, us coast guard Suggest a correction × Suggest A Correction Your name Your email Report a typo or grammatical error Cancel Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest LinkedIn Email The News 3 App Center Get the latest news and live radar on your phone!

In the bag was an assortment of frozen fruit that would become his breakfast smoothie before he headed to work at the Command, Control and Communications Engineering Center on Base Portsmouth, bright and early the next morning. Even before the doors slid completely open, Brown said he heard sounds of a scuffle and a voice booming, "Get down! Get down!" The sliding doors framed a chaotic scene: two police officers were wrestling with a man who had pinned one of the officers to the ground and was punching him in the face. "It took me a second or two to realize what was happening," said Brown. "Then I kicked off my flip-flops, threw my keys and my groceries down, and took action." One of the police officers was working part time at Wal-Mart that evening when he recognized Clinton Pickens, a 32 year old suspected of burglarizing five local businesses between April 19 and 25. The officer spoke with Pickens until another officer from the Portsmouth Police Department arrived to help arrest the suspect. "As soon as the second officer got there, the suspect became violent and started assaulting the first officer," said Detective Misty Holley, public information officer with the Portsmouth Police Department. "He became extremely aggressive." Brown handled the suspect's aggression by hauling him off the police officer and helping the officers pin him down. Another good Samaritan rushed over to assist Brown and the officers. Brown said the individual restrained the suspect's legs while the officers placed him in handcuffs. "It all happened quickly, and I didn't catch his name," said Brown. "But he was a great help." Detective Holley said both the good Samaritan and Brown were instrumental in subduing the suspect and minimizing the police officer's injuries. "The officer sustained minor facial injuries and bruising," Holley said. "If Petty Officer Brown and the other good Samaritan hadn't reacted so quickly, it could have ended up much worse." Quick reaction time and poise under pressure are traits cultivated and often found within the ranks of the U.S. Coast Guard. Brown, who has served in the Coast Guard since 2003, said he originally joined looking for a change and a way to find direction in his life. While he now works as an electronics technician and provides technical support for Coast Guard cutter navigation systems, Brown previously served as a boarding team member aboard the 210-foot Cutter Resolute out of St. Petersburg, Florida. During his tour aboard the Resolute, Brown participated in law enforcement missions as a boarding team member and underwent countless hours of tactical training - training he said came into play during his scuffle with Pickens. "It's been a while since I've used those techniques," he said. "But you never forget them." But Brown said you don't need tactical training to come to the aid of police officers or other people in trouble: you just need to act quickly and do what you can. "You've got to look out for your local law enforcement members," said Brown. "You never know when you're going to need their assistance in return. It all comes back around full circle."

Tennessee police say the seven bounty hunters and bail bondsmen have been indicted on first-degree murder and other charges in the killing of an unarmed man and the wounding of another. Authorities say 24-year-old Jalen Johnson and another man were wounded April 23, 2017, after the bounty hunters and bail bondsmen confronted Johnson and his three friends in a Wal-Mart parking lot in Clarksville, Tenn. Police said that neither Johnson nor his three friends had outstanding warrants. (Clarksville Police Department via AP) NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Seven bounty hunters who descended on the wrong car outside a Wal-Mart have been indicted on first-degree murder charges in the killing of an unarmed man and the wounding of another, Tennessee police announced Wednesday. The charges come after a chaotic scene in Clarksville on April 23, where police said the bounty hunters shot at the four people in the sedan and chased them for seven miles. Not one of the men in the sedan was wanted on outstanding charges. In fact, the Clarksville bounty hunters were looking for someone else, and there is no indication that any of the victims fired at the defendants or were even armed, police spokesman Jim Knoll said in an email. Bail bondsmen are empowered to hire or act as bounty hunters to bring in people who violate the terms of jail bonds, but they can’t use deadly force unless it’s self-defense. Killed was 24-year-old Jalen Johnson, a father of three from Clarksville. His family called him an innocent man who died in an act of terrorizing violence. Johnson’s uncle, Toni Jenkins, told The Associated Press that his nephew and the three men in the car with him had no idea why people would suddenly block their car in the Wal-Mart parking lot. Fearing an attack by gang members, they tried to flee. The bounty hunters, Jenkins said, started shooting in the parking lot and continued to fire on them during the chase, even ramming the Nissan along the way. Clarksville police would not confirm or deny these details, but authorities have said they are troubled by how the bounty hunters put people at risk. The Montgomery County grand jury charged all seven men with first-degree felony murder, three counts of attempted second-degree murder, three counts of especially aggravated kidnapping, attempted especially aggravated kidnapping, four counts of aggravated assault, employing a firearm in commission of a dangerous felony and felony reckless endangerment, police said. Some of the men charged were bonding agents and others were strictly bounty hunters, Knoll said. The men charged include: William L. Byles, 31; Kenneth Chiasson, 38; Antwon D. Keesee, 32; Jonathan Schnepp, 31; Roger D. West, 31; Prentice L. Williams, 34 and Joshua Young, 27. They do not yet have court dates or attorneys listed, the Montgomery County Circuit Court Clerk’s office said. All the men are from Clarksville, a city about 50 miles (80 kilometers) northwest of Nashville near the Kentucky state line.

The charges come after a chaotic scene in Clarksville on April 23, where police said the bounty hunters shot at four people in a Nissan sedan and chased them for seven miles. None of the men in the car was wanted on outstanding charges, the AP reports. In fact, the bounty hunters were looking for someone else, with no indication any of the victims fired at the defendants or were even armed, police spokesman Jim Knoll says. Killed was 24-year-old Jalen Johnson, a father of three from Clarksville. His family called him an innocent man who died in an act of terrorizing violence. Johnson's uncle, Toni Jenkins, says his nephew and and his three companions thought they were being attacked by gang members and tried to flee. The bounty hunters, Jenkins says, started shooting in the Walmart parking lot and kept firing during the chase. Clarksville cops wouldn't discuss these details. The Montgomery County grand jury charged the seven men from Clarksville—William Byles, 31; Kenneth Chiasson, 38; Antwon Keesee, 32; Jonathan Schnepp, 31; Roger West, 31; Prentice Williams, 34; and Joshua Young, 27—with first-degree felony murder, three counts of attempted second-degree murder, and a slew of other charges, police say. Some of the men charged were bonding agents, others were strictly bounty hunters, per Knoll. Bail bondsmen can hire or act as bounty hunters to bring in people who violate jail bond terms, but they can't use deadly force unless it's self-defense.   My Take on This Story Report a story error Show results without voting  |   4% Hilarious 2% Intriguing 24% Depressing 3% Brilliant 55% Scary 11% Ridiculous Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Email Story 52 comments Copyright 2017 Newser, LLC.

Last month's job cuts were 43 percent lower than the 64,141 recorded in April 2016. Berkeley Lovelace Jr. | @BerkeleyJr 19 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES show chapters Challenger: April job cuts down 15%, lowest YTD total since 2014    19 Hours Ago | 00:57 U.S. employers announced plans in April to cut 36,602 jobs, a 15 percent decrease from March, outplacement consultancy Challenger, Gray & Christmas reported Thursday. Last month's job cuts were 43 percent lower than the 64,141 recorded in April 2016. Employers have announced a total of 162,803 planned job cuts through the first four months of 2017, down 35 percent in the same period a year ago. "Although restructuring in the retail sector continues to shed jobs, we aren't seeing the wide-scale layoffs in other sectors, like energy or tech," said John A. Challenger, chief executive officer of Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Retail had the most job losses in April with 11,669 job cuts, bringing the 2017 total to 50,133, up 36 percent from job cuts announced the in the first fourth months last year. "Retail right now is dominating with many store closings, several thousand store closings announced so far this year," Challenger said on "Squawk Box." The energy sector has cut 8,725 for the year, an 87 percent decrease. Computer firms announced 840 job cuts in April. That's 95 percent lower than the 17,015 cuts in that sector in April 2016. The Challenger numbers came a day after ADP and Moody's Analytics said companies added 177,000 jobs in April, above the 175,000 expected from economists surveyed by Reuters. On Friday, the Labor Department releases its closely watched monthly employment report. Challenger said the economy seems to be in a "holding pattern," as companies await the outcome on President Donald Trump's proposed tax reform. The White House released an outline for tax reform last week.

Bitte versuchen Sie es später noch einmal. „Regeln spielen keine Rolle“ - Drama um Filmproduzenten Quelle: Fox AUTOPLAY Eine Schönheitskönigin aus der Provinz kommt nach Los Angeles. Die Legende Howard Hughes hat sie als Schauspielerin unter Vertrag genommen. Die Welt des Milliardärs stellt ihre Wertvorstellungen auf den Kopf. Quelle: Fox Fünf Jahrzehnte hat Warren Beatty an seinem Film über den Filmproduzenten, Flugzeugkonstrukteur und Exzentriker Howard Hughes herumgedacht. „Regeln spielen keine Rolle“, heißt er. Und er ist sehr lang. Comment 0 Kommentare Facebook Twitter Whatsapp Anzeige Fangen wir mal mit einer kleinen Geschichte an, die gar nicht hierhergehört. Es war einmal der Chef eines mittelständischen Unternehmens, der traf anlässlich eines ziemlich feinen Abendessens auf zwei seiner Untergebenen. Die hatten an eben jenem Tag geheiratet. Der Mann schaute kurz auf, als er sich dieser prinzipiell erfreulichen Tatsache bewusst wurde. Und sprach: „Bei Walmart wäre das nicht passiert.“ Woran man erkennen kann, dass pietistischer Puritanismus bis in die heutige Zeit ein erhebliches Deformationspotenzial besitzt. Und womit man ziemlich genau im Zentrum dessen angekommen sein dürfte, was vermutlich Warren Beatty vielleicht dazu bewogen haben mag, nach gut fünf Jahrzehnten des Daranherumgrübelns seinen fünften eigenen Film abzudrehen. Herrliches Eis, herrliche Autos „Regeln spielen keine Rolle“, heißt er. Er sieht sehr schön aus. Die Farben sind großartig. Fabrikneu und perfekt poliert fahren die herrlichsten Automobile herum. Ein grandioses Wasserflugzeug ankert im Hafen. Dann wird sogar geflogen. Es gibt kiloweise herrliches Speiseeis. Darum geht es aber gar nicht. Anzeige Auch eigentlich nicht um den mehrfach verbiopicten Filmproduzenten, Flugzeugkonstrukteur und Großexzentriker Howard Hughes, den Warren Beatty spielt, obwohl er 20 Jahre älter ist, als Hughes es zu der Zeit war, von der „Regeln spielen keine Rolle“ erzählen soll. Die Apfelblütenkönigin von Virginia gibt sich erst dem Alkohol hin. Und dann dem mächtigen Mogul: Lily Collins als Marla Mabrey Quelle: 2017 Twentieth Century Fox Beatty hat auch das Drehbuch geschrieben, inszeniert, produziert, geschnitten, vielleicht hat er sogar die Autos persönlich gewaschen, das ließ sich leider nicht verifizieren. Eigentlich geht es um Marla Mabrey (Lily Collins) und den von Alden Ehrenreich gespielten Frank Forbes (Besitzer einer Stabreimallergie sollten diesen Film eher meiden). Sie ist jungfräuliche Apfelblütenkönigin aus dem schönen Staat Virginia, streng gläubig natürlich und wäre wahrscheinlich vegan, wenn es das damals gegeben hätte. Howard Hughes hat sich in ein Bild von ihr verliebt und sie für das damals irrwitzige Monatsgehalt von 400 Dollar als nächste Marilyn Monroe nach Hollywood geholt, wo sie einigermaßen schnell merkt, dass es noch gut zwei Dutzend anderer Schönheiten gibt, denen es ähnlich geht. Anzeige Er wiederum ist mindestens so streng gläubig, allerdings von einer anderen christlichen Richtung aus, und fährt die Autos, die Warren Beatty poliert hat. Besonders gern fährt er mit ihnen Marla durch die Gegend. Bei Walmart wäre das nicht passiert Und weil sich Hughes in der ersten halben Stunde gar nicht blicken lässt, verlieben sich halt die beiden. Was aber im Hughes-Universum – hier tritt die Walmart-Regel in Kraft – natürlich strengstens verboten ist. Möglicherweise, weil er merkte, dass diese Geschichte der beiden gegen alle Regeln und christliche Wohlanständigkeit (er ist schon verlobt!) sich Verliebenden nicht mal für eine Dreiviertelstunde voller Herzeleid gereicht hätte und ein Howard-Hughes-Film ohne Howard Hughes eher seltsam wäre, tritt Beatty dann aus dem selbst gewählten Schatten heraus. Ein großes Kind mit seinem Lieblingsspielzeug (neben den Flugzeugen und dem Geld und der Politik): Warren Beatty ist für seine Rolle eigentlich 20 Jahre zu alt. Manchmal sieht man ...das gar nicht Quelle: Twentieth Century Fox Was dem Film allerdings immer noch nicht zu einer Haltung zu seinem Thema verhilft, was auch immer das gewesen sein mag. Es kommt zu einer der seltsamsten Sexszenen der Filmgeschichte. Es wird geflogen. Ein Dinner im Schatten eines Riesenfluges findet statt. Hier fliegt leider gar nichts Die Liebe kommt, die Liebe geht, die Liebe kehrt zurück. Zeitgeschichte flimmert – historisch eher unscharf – vorbei. Es wird fein gespielt. Es wird aber kein Film draus. Keiner jedenfalls – das hat er mit dem Hughes’schen „Spruce Goose“ („Fichten-Gans“ wegen des maßgeblichen Baustoffs) genannten Wasserflugmonster gemein –, der auch nur für eine Viertelstunde ins Fliegen kommt. „Das gab es so noch nie bei den Oscars“ Das Video konnte nicht abgespielt werden. Bitte versuchen Sie es später noch einmal. Was für eine Panne: Bei den Oscars verlesen die Laudatoren Faye Dunaway und Warren Beatty den falschen Sieger: „La La Land“. Gewonnen hatte aber „Moonlight“.

Botanists and conservationists have long fought to save the rare forest, which harbors a menagerie of endangered animals and plants, including one beetle and 31 plants that can be found no where else. Patrick Farrell Miami Herald Environment May 04, 2017 6:00 AM In a remnant of the world's rarest forest, Miami-Dade may stick a Walmart By Jenny Staletovich jstaletovich@miamiherald.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Roger Hammer is standing in a forest that used to be the bottom of the ocean, about 100,000 years ago. The ground is pitted with holes, a limestone honeycomb cemented by bits of grain that look like fish eggs and nearly barren of soil. Yet, miraculously, life springs from the rock: slash pines, silver palms, tiny clumps of leafy plants splattered like paint across the rocks and a rainbow of wildflowers that manage to sprout from the bony floor. This plot near Zoo Miami is a remnant of one of the world’s rarest forests: pine rockland. It once covered 186,000 acres, colonizing a ridge of ancient coral reef — the high ground snaking south from Miami under the Upper Keys and reappearing in Big Pine Key. No more. Today, the place where Hammer, an author and former Miami-Dade County senior naturalist, has collected wildflowers for forty years is down to about 3,700 acres outside Everglades National Park, splintered by development into shards scattered around the county’s south end. So little is left that many of its inhabitants — bats, snakes, butterflies, beetles and a host of plants — are in danger of disappearing too. You just never know what you might find. Author and botanist Roger Hammer “If you come out at different times of the year, it always changes,” said Hammer, who helped restore the 120 acres of pineland here in Larry and Penny Thompson Park after Hurricane Andrew, pine bark beetles and Burma reed nearly destroyed it. “You just never know what you might find.”   Including, to environmentalists dismay, a Walmart. Just north of the park, in what was the largest remaining tract of Miami’s pine rockland on an old blimp base, a Palm Beach County developer is moving closer to finalizing a shopping center anchored by the big box store. The project will also include 900 apartments, a parking lot, possibly a school and replace the 90-acre forest with separate 24-acre and 20-acre preserves. It is the first major development on the globally imperiled forest since the county launched a land-buying program to save endangered habitat in 1990. The county now manages about 1,500 acres. New pines grow among old at Larry and Penny Thompson Park near Zoo Miami, which was restored a decade ago after Hurricane Andrew and bark beetles killed nearly all the trees and invasive Burma reed took over. PATRICK FARRELL pfarrell@miamiherald.com To build it, developer Peter Cummings and the University of Miami — which acquired the land at no cost after the base was decommissioned and in the 1990s objected to county efforts to preserve it — spent the last three years conducting environmental assessments. (The plan is now being reviewed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and open to public comment.) They concluded that much of the pineland is overgrown and beyond salvage. Hammer disagrees. “They’re easy to reclaim, but they’re using this false argument that it’s ruined and therefore we need a Walmart,” he said. “That’s bogus.” That’s because Miami’s rockland plants are among the planet’s toughest, from the slash pines that evolved into their own subspecies of super hard wood, the Dade County pine prized by old-time builders and known to botanists as var. densa, to the obscure tiny polygala, which stands a few inches high and lives for less than a year. They may not tolerate development, but they can survive South Florida’s withering heat, fire season and occasional drought, grow on rocks or take root in chalky soil that piled up in holes in the limestone but retained neither water nor nutrients. Before more powerful tractors came along in the 1940s, farmers struggling to coax crops on the land called it pothole farming. Hammer, a survival instructor for the Discovery Channel’s Naked and Afraid, said living amid the pinelands’ stinging nettles, that can cause throbbing pain for days, and poisonwoods would be hard, for man or beast. “This habitat here would be a really tough way to go,” he said. The Florida prickly pear cactus is the state’s most common cactus and one of the largest blooming flowers in pine rockland. PATRICK FARRELL pfarrell@miamiherald.com But what makes it harsh also makes it unique. Sandwiched between the coast and marshes, the pinelands grew in isolation, an evolution of apart-ness that produced a North American version of the Galapagos Islands, with 31 plants found no where else in the world. “They’ve been around for a long time, but they’ve been in pockets with the ups and downs of sea level,” said Tom Lodge, author of The Everglades Handbook. “If we are to preserve that heritage for people to see and enjoy for the future, we’ve got to be extremely careful. Because it’s so small, you could easily extinguish some of the species that require the habitat.” While what’s left might just look like open land awaiting the next strip mall, and not like much of a forest to northerners used to towering canopies, pinelands have dramatic beauty. It’s just small-scale.Up close, it’s a determined beauty, and the reason why environmentalists have fought so long and so hard to save it. High on Hammer’s list are wildflowers, plants with hairy stems and spiky leaves and beautiful bell-shaped flowers. One day this week, it took him about “ten seconds” to find the tiny heart-shaped leaves of one of the forest’s rarest plants, the deltoid spurge (spurges were once used as laxatives because of the bitter milky sap they produce) which now inhabit the Earth only on pine rockland between Sunset Driver and Southwest 264th Street. Deltoid spurge, one of five endangered or threatened plants in pine rockland, can now only be found between in pinelands east of Everglades National Park, between Southwest 72nd and Southwest 264th streets. PATRICK FARRELL pfarrell@miamiherald.com “There’s cactus and coontie, that dates back to the age of the dinosaurs,” he said. “It’s a pretty harsh environment but really one of the most floristically rich habitats we have.” As he walked around Thompson park, Hammer pointed out flowers that shined like jewels against a grey-green canvas: the pineland poinsettia, another spurge and the tougher-looking cousin of the crimson holiday plant; the lavender flower of the oakleaf fleabane, which early settlers stuffed in mattresses to keep away fleas; and the bright yellow trumpet of a groundcherry, which grows berry-sized tomatoes wrapped in papery husks. A Deering partridge pea, named for industrialist John Deering, is one of the many wildflowers that grow in pine rockland and is considered very rare outside Miami-Dade County. PATRICK FARRELL pfarrell@miamiherald.com The forest is probably best known for as the source of hard-as-rock slash pine, marketed by lumberyards as Dade pine to distinguish its unique strength and which, along with the quarried oolite floor, helped build many early homes in South Florida. “Still today you have to drill a hole with a drill. You can’t pound a nail in it,” Hammer said. The forest also grew to perfectly reflect the environment in inhabited. From the beetles to the butterflies to the bats, each filled a niche in a very tight web. Miami tiger beetles, which can now only be found on pineland around the old base, controlled the ant population. Butterflies pollinated flowers. Bats ate bugs. Seasonal fires thinned the pine and kept live oaks and other taller trees from growing too big, which allowed the plants to grow on the rocky floor. The forest survived as long as nature took its course and the floor remained intact. 1,500 acresThe amount of remaining pine rockland maintained by Miami-Dade County When Hurricane Andrew plowed across Larry and Penny Thompson Park, it snapped some trees and left others bent “like fishing poles,” Hammer said. The rockland pine store much of their resin in their roots, which keep pine-boring beetles at bay. But with the winds wrenching the trees from their shallow purchase, the trees lost their best defense. Ips pine bark beetles killed what was left and invasive Burma weed — an Asian grass that escaped a Coconut Grove test garden decades ago to become one of the biggest threats to pinelands — quickly took over. To save it, Hammer and work crews attacked the towering grass with metal-bladed weed whackers, then knocked out new sprouts with herbicide. In other overgrown tracts around the county, they used chainsaws to thin the hardwoods first, then set fires to restore the seed banks. “If you cut all that down and burn it, those seeds sprout right away,” he said. Unlike its larger cousin, the pineland poinsettia has spikey long leaves and delicate flowers and is a state-listed endangered plant. PATRICK FARRELL pfarrell@miamiherald.com The key is keeping the ancient ocean floor intact. Once the rock is covered with fill and paved over for parking lots or buildings, it’s gone forever. “There’s probably more plants per acre in this type of habitat than there are in most habitats in Florida,” Hammer said. “To say this is all screwed up and this is no good and get rid of it, it’s so bogus. This cost a lot of money. Don’t get me wrong. It’s thousands of dollars of acres because you’ve got people out here working every day…But there’s just these little parcels here and there that make up what’s left.” Follow Jenny Staletovich on Twitter @jenstaletovich Many of the pine rocklands around Miami-Dade County are open to the public.

To fuel growth, the fashion world is increasingly counting on plus-size customers, a demographic that it has long ignored. According to market researcher NPD Group, sales of women's plus-size clothing (defined as size 12 and above) rose 6 percent to $21.4 billion in 2016, double the rate of overall apparel sales. By 2020, revenue in the category could hit $24 billion, though Ascena Retail (ASNA), parent of plus-size chain Lane Bryant, argues that the "true opportunity" in the market may be as much as $53 billion, depending on how it's measured. Many in the fashion world have gotten the message that bigger is better, or they may be paying attention to research that has found the average American woman now wears a size 16 or 18, equal to a plus size 20w. Walmart (WMT) in March unveiled plans to acquire independent online retailer ModCloth,  which the retail giant described as a pioneer in the fashion industry on issues of "size diversity, lifestyle inclusiveness, and body positivity over the last decade." Walmart didn't disclose the deal's price. Play Video CBSN Sports Illustrated features plus-size models For its annual swimsuit edition, Sports Illustrated agreed to include an ad campaign featuring plus-size models and one woman who is 56 years old... Designers including Michael Kors (KORS) and Christian Siriano featured "a range of body types on their fall runways," while H&M included "shapely models" Kate Syme and Stela Duval in its collections, according to Women's Wear Daily. Designer Prabal Gurung, whose clients include Oprah Winfrey among others, recently announced plans for a limited collection to be sold at Lane Bryant. Earlier this year, sports apparel giant Nike (NKE) began selling plus-size workout clothes. Retailer JCPenney (JCP) last year unveiled its Boutique + collection for millennials in conjunction with "Project Runway" winner Ashley Nell Tipton. The Plano, Texas-based company plans to further expand its plus-size line this year with swimwear and other accessories. Big-box chain Target (TGT) unveiled its Aba and Vin collection in 2015. According to a report from McKinsey & Co., the number of mentions of "plus size" in the fashion press tripled in 2016 compared with the previous year. The trend shows no signs of slowing. "Fashion brands are rapidly responding to a cultural shift toward body positivity and a growing appreciation of curvy figures, by designing specifically for a larger range of sizes rather than just expanding their size range as an afterthought," the report said. Play Video CBS This Morning Will plus-size wardrobe rental disrupt fashion industry? CEO Christine Hunsicker helped lead two tech start-ups until they were bought by Yahoo! and Facebook. Now she hopes to disrupt the $1.4 trillion ... However, traditional retailers such as Ascena, which also owns Catherines plus-size chain, will face tough competition from both brick-and-mortar stores and online rivals such as Amazon (AMZN). Comparable-store sales, a key retail metric measuring activity at existing locations, has fallen at Ascena's Lane Bryant and Catherines as foot traffic declined. An Ascena spokesperson couldn't immediately be reached. Men's big and tall fashions are also selling well at a time when large apparel chains such as Gap (GPS) are struggling to attract customers. Destination XL (DXLG), the largest specialty retailer of big and tall fashions for men, reported positive comparable-store sales in three out of four quarters last year, which analyst Greg Pendy of Sidoti & Co. called "impressive relative to the overall industry." He rates the stock a "buy." Helping the chain's results have been strong demand from so-called "end of rack" customers with waistlines of between 38 inches to 46 inches, sizes that can be difficult to find at many retailers. Said Pendy: "That's been a bright spot for Destination XL to capture that opportunity." © 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.. All Rights Reserved.

By Morgan Quinn | May 4, 2017   Amazon made its move to dominate the grocery market with the introduction of its grocery delivery service, AmazonFresh, in 2007. Amazon's grocery delivery service works just like competitor services offered by traditional grocery stores, such as Safeway, Walmart and Whole Foods: Customers place an order online to have groceries delivered later that day or early the next morning. While using grocery delivery services is certainly more convenient than going to your local grocery store, there are a number of reasons why making Amazon your primary source for groceries might not be the most economical choice. Find out why choosing AmazonFresh could be one of the costliest grocery shopping mistakes you'll ever make. I AM NIKOM / Shutterstock.com Amazon Charges High Membership Fees AmazonFresh is only available to Amazon Prime members. An annual Amazon Prime membership costs $99, and a monthly membership costs $10.99 per month — or nearly $132 per year. AmazonFresh costs $14.99 per month, which means an annual Amazon Prime member who adds the Fresh benefit to his membership will pay nearly $280 a year. Considering you can feed a family of five for less than $125 per week, ask yourself: Is the price worth it? Other membership clubs, such as Sam's Club and Costco, have much lower annual fees. Costco's membership fee is $55 a year, whereas a membership at Sam's Club runs $45 a year. Phototasty / Shutterstock.com Meat Is More Expensive on AmazonFresh If meat is part of your diet, you might want to skip AmazonFresh. GOBankingRates compared the prices on more than a dozen meat products — including beef, chicken, pork and seafood — and found that the AmazonFresh prices were an average of 63 percent higher than like items at Safeway. For example, 90 percent lean ground beef was 25 percent higher, filet mignon was 41 percent higher, and boneless pork chops were an astonishing 166 percent higher. Shoppers can find lower-priced items on AmazonFresh; however, meat is not one of those items. A Cost Breakdown: How to Pick Your Cut of Meat iStock.com / 97 AmazonFresh Doesn’t Offer Bulk Deals AmazonFresh doesn't sell items in bulk like warehouse clubs do. Shoppers can add multiples of an item to their carts, but increasing the number of units doesn't trigger any kind of discount. Although AmazonFresh offers customers special promotions, there can be limits to how many items a customer can buy at one time. This is so Amazon can "provide all customers with a great selection and great prices." For bulk deals, head to Costco or Sam's Club. Syda Productions / Shutterstock.com AmazonFresh Discounts Might Not Be the Best Deal AmazonFresh runs "Fresh Deals," which include discounts on specific brands like 30 percent off Barilla pasta and sauces, 30 percent off Muir Glen canned tomato products and 30 percent off certain Birds Eye products. However, budget-minded shoppers — particularly those who clip coupons — might find better deals at their regular grocery stores. For example, a can of Muir Glen organic crushed tomatoes is $1.79 on AmazonFresh but just $1 at Safeway. Look: 7 Ways Amazon Is Making It Easier to Spend Your Money Andriy Blokhin / Shutterstock.com Having Groceries Delivered Comes With Delivery Charges If you are familiar with online shopping, then you know orders that total less than a certain dollar amount come with a shipping charge. For AmazonFresh, you must spend $40 or more in order to qualify for free shipping. Purchases less than $40 come with a shipping charge of $9.99. If you only need a couple of items, then you are undoubtedly wasting your money. Grocery delivery services offered by traditional grocers also come with delivery fees, although the thresholds are even higher — like $12.95 on orders less than $150 at Vons. Having your groceries delivered is convenient, but visiting the grocery store in person ensures you avoid these fees altogether. iStock.com / izusek Driver Tips Add to Your Grocery Bill In addition to an annual fee of close $180 — plus $99 for Amazon Prime membership — Amazon suggests tipping your delivery person 10 percent. Tipping is customary, especially for good service, but it's an additional cost to your grocery budget. For example, if you had AmazonFresh groceries delivered every week, a $3 tip would cost you an extra $156 per year year. nd3000 / Shutterstock.com Buying Groceries Online Eliminates Your Quality Control When you go to the grocery store, you typically comb through the produce selection to pick the best looking fruits and vegetables. When you use AmazonFresh or other grocery delivery services, you're relying on someone else to make this choice for you. This is critical when you're purchasing items like bananas, lettuce, tomatoes and berries. While Amazon does let you specify whether you want "ready to eat" or "not yet ripe" avocados, you never quite know what you're going to get. Fortunately, Amazon will refund items you aren't satisfied with. But, you'll have to go through the hassle of submitting a complaint and either making an additional trip to your local grocery store or waiting for your next delivery to get what you need.

The charges come after a chaotic scene in Clarksville on April 23, where police said the bounty hunters shot at the four people in the sedan and chased them for seven miles. Not one of the men in the sedan was wanted on outstanding charges. Story continues below In fact, the Clarksville bounty hunters were looking for someone else, and there is no indication that any of the victims fired at the defendants or were even armed, police spokesman Jim Knoll said in an email. Bail bondsmen are empowered to hire or act as bounty hunters to bring in people who violate the terms of jail bonds, but they can’t use deadly force unless it’s self-defence. Killed was 24-year-old Jalen Johnson, a father of three from Clarksville. His family called him an innocent man who died in an act of terrorizing violence. Johnson’s uncle, Toni Jenkins, told The Associated Press that his nephew and the three men in the car with him had no idea why people would suddenly block their car in the Wal-Mart parking lot. Fearing an attack by gang members, they tried to flee. The bounty hunters, Jenkins said, started shooting in the parking lot and continued to fire on them during the chase, even ramming the Nissan along the way. Clarksville police would not confirm or deny these details, but authorities have said they are troubled by how the bounty hunters put people at risk. The Montgomery County grand jury charged all seven men with first-degree felony murder, three counts of attempted second-degree murder, three counts of especially aggravated kidnapping, attempted especially aggravated kidnapping, four counts of aggravated assault, employing a firearm in commission of a dangerous felony and felony reckless endangerment, police said. Some of the men charged were bonding agents and others were strictly bounty hunters, Knoll said. The men charged include: William L. Byles, 31; Kenneth Chiasson, 38; Antwon D. Keesee, 32; Jonathan Schnepp, 31; Roger D. West, 31; Prentice L. Williams, 34 and Joshua Young, 27. They do not yet have court dates or attorneys listed, the Montgomery County Circuit Court Clerk’s office said. All the men are from Clarksville, a city about 50 miles (80 kilometres) northwest of Nashville near the Kentucky state line. © 2017 The Canadian Press Report an error Clarksville Clarksville 7 Clarksville bounty hunter killing Clarksville bounty hunters Clarksville Tennessee Jalen Johnson Editor's Picks Lifestyle The couples who found love on an app destined for casual hook-ups Canada Marijuana will be legal, but for many activists the fight isn't over Canada Why Canada wins, but many Torontonians lose, from Ontario's new housing measures Canada Inside Canada's flexible work economy.

Music News Entertainment Politics Features Share < br />this article: ‘Cash me outside’ girl threatens to sue Walmart for plagiarism In News by Tosten Burks / May 3, 2017 Share < br />this article: Follow @tostenburks It was only a matter of time before the “Cash me ousside” meme turned into an intellectual property battle. Such is our world, where teens are endlessly pilfered for their youth and blood to feed the gears of capitalism and old people. Danielle Bregoli, the 14-year-old who conjured the phrase on Dr. Phil in December, is threatening to sue Walmart, TMZ reports. The global retailer is currently selling t-shirts, tank-tops, and sweatshirts featuring Bregoli’s full quote from the show, “Cash me ousside, how bow dah,” which she originally directed at a studio audience full of “hoes.” You can purchase the items in several colors, including “Carolina Blue,” “Light Pink,” and “Gold.” According to TMZ, Bregoli’s legal team gave Walmart five days to remove the 15 articles of clothing printed with the phrase from its online store, or else they plan to sue. It’s unclear what legal rights Bregoli has to the slogan, three different variations of which are pending trademarks. Jefferey Perez in North Carolina applied for “CASH ME OUSSIDE, HOW BOW DAH?”, Randall Whitney in North Carolina applied for “CASH ME OUSSIDE HOW BOW DAH”, and Paige Burton in Maryland applied for “CASH ME OUTSIDE, HOW BOUT DAH?” The Walmart merchandise styles the phrase as “Cash Me Outside How Bout Dah.” A Walmart rep told TMZ the company hasn’t seen Bregoli’s letter but it “takes the claims seriously and will investigate.” How bow dah?

MEDIA Hulu joins the live television wars Hulu on Wednesday unveiled its long-awaited streaming app, Hulu with Live TV, which seeks to compete with the likes of SlingTV, DirecTV Now and YouTube TV. The app, which starts at $40 per month, grants access to more than 50 channels and marks the latest step toward a future where consumers can view live cable and broadcast shows from their smartphones, tablets and other Internet-connected devices.

RETAIL Wal-Mart is working to catch up to Amazon Wal-Mart Stores’s e-commerce chief notes the world’s biggest retailer has plenty of ground to cover as it expands its online business in the face of fierce competition from digital leaders like Amazon.com. “There are certainly areas where we are playing defense, and we’re behind and need to catch up,” Marc Lore, chief executive of Wal-Mart’s U.S. e-commerce business, said Wednesday. Wal-Mart put Lore in his current post after buying his company, Jet.com, for $3.3 billion in September. Since then, he has rolled out free two-day shipping for orders more than $35, offered discounts on online merchandise picked up in stores, and acquired brands like outdoor retailer Moosejaw and women’s apparel seller ModCloth. Online sales grew 29 percent over the Christmas holiday quarter.

The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) developed the so-called anti-corruption compliance program and Wal-Mart is hoping to be the first U.S. company to get certified under it, said Jay Jorgensen, Wal-Mart's executive vice president and global chief ethics and compliance officer. "We have begun looking for a company that would certify us," Jorgensen told the Thomson Reuters Financial and Risk Summit in New York. The ISO is the world's largest developer and publisher of international standards. Jorgensen added that Wal-Mart was interested in seeing the program develop in the United States, with the government laying out its own anti-corruption compliance framework or adopting ISO standards to help protect companies that follow it and defend themselves if something goes wrong. Jorgensen also shared a recent development in which federal agencies have contacted the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer about compliance programs. "Over the past couple of months ... some of the federal agencies have reached out to say 'hey do you have any feedback for us, anything we are doing is unreasonable?,'" Jorgensen said. Wal-Mart has given feedback to federal agencies and will continue doing so and the company would also be open to speaking with state regulators about compliance, he said. Jorgensen cited an example of how a broken baby shampoo bottle in California is treated as hazardous waste that retailers have to dispose off through an incinerator. "We would love it if California would say 'hey we would like some feedback," Jorgensen said. Jorgensen, who joined Wal-Mart in 2012, has been instrumental in revamping Wal-Mart's compliance systems around the world and building a dedicated ethics and compliance team. That team has a staff of over 2,300, including over 500 in the United States and over 1,800 in international markets. Since 2013, Wal-Mart has invested more than $141 million in global ethics and compliance systems, Jorgensen said. More recently, Wal-Mart has created licensing teams that monitor the more than 56,000 licenses and permits Wal-Mart needs to operate in global markets using a centralized licensing system that reduces the error of wrongdoing and increases transparency, he said. For the last four years, the Wal-Mart board's compensation committee has conditioned a portion of its most senior executives' compensation on making adequate progress toward annual compliance goals. In its latest compliance report, Wal-Mart said it has achieved over 200 of these board-level objectives, including over 60 that relate specifically to its anti-corruption program. Wal-Mart's ethics and compliance system came into focus after a New York Times report in 2012 found Wal-Mart had engaged in a multi-year bribery campaign to build its Wal-Mart de Mexico business. This was followed by an investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice into potential misconduct by Wal-Mart, including violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in some overseas markets including China, Brazil, India and Mexico. In October, Wal-Mart rebuffed a proposal by U.S. prosecutors to pay at least $600 million to settle a corruption probe into the company's practices in markets including Mexico, India and China. So far Wal-Mart has spent about $800 million on legal fees and an internal investigation into the alleged payments and to revamp its compliance systems around the world.

Wal-Mart's ethics and compliance system came into focus after a New York Times report in 2012 found Wal-Mart had engaged in a multi-year bribery campaign to build its Wal-Mart de Mexico business. This was followed by an investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice into potential misconduct by Wal-Mart, including violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in some overseas markets including China, Brazil, India and Mexico. In October, Wal-Mart rebuffed a proposal by U.S. prosecutors to pay at least $600 million to settle a corruption probe into the company's practices in markets including Mexico, India and China. So far Wal-Mart has spent about $800 million on legal fees and an internal investigation into the alleged payments and to revamp its compliance systems around the world.

Reuters Business Standard http://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/wap/images/bs_logo_amp.png 177 22 Wal-Mart seeks anti-corruption certification, in talks with regulators By Kevin Krolicki and Nandita Bose NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc said on Wednesday it was considering getting certified under a new international program that could help companies defend themselves against isolated cases of corruption or poor business practices. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) developed the so-called anti-corruption compliance program and Wal-Mart is hoping to be the first U.S. company to get certified under it, said Jay Jorgensen, Wal-Mart's executive vice president and global chief ethics and compliance officer. "We have begun looking for a company that would certify us," Jorgensen told the Thomson Reuters Financial and Risk Summit in New York. The ISO is the world's largest developer and publisher of international standards. Jorgensen added that Wal-Mart was interested in seeing the program develop in the United States, with the government laying out its own anti-corruption compliance framework or adopting ISO standards to help protect companies that follow it and defend themselves if something goes wrong. Jorgensen also shared a recent development in which federal agencies have contacted the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer about compliance programs. "Over the past couple of months ... some of the federal agencies have reached out to say 'hey do you have any feedback for us, anything we are doing is unreasonable?,'" Jorgensen said. Wal-Mart has given feedback to federal agencies and will continue doing so and the company would also be open to speaking with state regulators about compliance, he said. Jorgensen cited an example of how a broken baby shampoo bottle in California is treated as hazardous waste that retailers have to dispose off through an incinerator. "We would love it if California would say 'hey we would like some feedback," Jorgensen said. Jorgensen, who joined Wal-Mart in 2012, has been instrumental in revamping Wal-Mart's compliance systems around the world and building a dedicated ethics and compliance team. That team has a staff of over 2,300, including over 500 in the United States and over 1,800 in international markets. Since 2013, Wal-Mart has invested more than $141 million in global ethics and compliance systems, Jorgensen said. More recently, Wal-Mart has created licensing teams that monitor the more than 56,000 licenses and permits Wal-Mart needs to operate in global markets using a centralized licensing system that reduces the error of wrongdoing and increases transparency, he said.

LOUIS (AP) - Floodwaters are receding in many hard-hit Midwestern communities, but the worst is yet to come on the Mississippi River. Heavy rain last weekend prompted a sudden rise in rivers in the central U.S. Nine deaths have been blamed on floods and flash floods. River levels are dropping along the Black River in Missouri and Arkansas, and the Meramec River in suburban St. Louis. Residents of the levee-protected part of Valley Park, Missouri, are to return home Friday. Two rental houses look underwater next to the Meramec River on Opps Lane in Fenton, Mo., Wednesday, May 3, 2017. Heavy rains have swollen many rivers to record levels in parts of Missouri, Illinois, Oklahoma and Arkansas. Five deaths have been blamed on flooding in Missouri, while hundreds of people have been displaced and thousands more are potentially in harm's way. (J.B. Forbes/St. Louis Post-Dispatch via AP) But problems persist on the Mississippi River. A 14.5-mile stretch remains closed at St. Louis. A bridge is closed at Chester, Illinois. And sandbagging volunteers are trying to protect homes in Cape Girardeau, Missouri. The Mississippi is expected to crest over the next couple of days at St. Louis and to the south.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obituaries E-edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds log in Site Site Archive Foreman makes bid for 8th term on Hornell Common Council Thursday May 4, 2017 at 11:12 PM May 4, 2017 at 11:12 PM By Jason JordanThe Evening Tribune HORNELL — A member of the Hornell Common Council hopes to extend his long-time legacy of service, announcing a bid for an eight term as alderman.  Joseph Foreman has represented the city's 5th Ward for 28 years, making him the longest serving member of the council. The ward encompasses an area wedged between the Canisteo River and Hakes Avenue east to west, and includes part of Genesee Street, Pearl Street, Platt Street, Sawyer Street and others.  Foreman is a retired college professor, who now teaches courses online. On the council, he heads up the Finance Committee, the Planning and Development Committee, and is a member of the Youth and Recreation Committee. "There's a lot of projects coming down the road between the Common Council and on the IDA board that I've had a lot of input and contact with and I really want to see those projects come to fruition and see them through to the end," he said. In his time in city government, Foreman is most proud of being part of the effort to establish one of the city's biggest economic drivers.  "I'm very proud of the Walmart/Wegmans project coming to fruition years ago and the Lowe's project," he said. Foreman sees similar economic progress coming down the line in the future, and wants to be a part fostering an atmosphere that can help make similar projects a reality.  "Keeping taxes in check, which I think over the years we've done an outstanding job with. Our taxes are extremely low. As far as yearly increases, we haven't had any property tax increase for several years, continuing good service to the citizens of Hornell," he said, outlining several priorities. Foreman believes the city is on the right track for growth in the future, hoping to stay the course. "There's nothing obviously wrong with the way things are working," he said. In the 5th Ward however, Foreman hopes to make progress in addressing abandoned and unoccupied homes.  "We have absentee landlords, dilapidated buildings and houses in the neighborhood that need to be addressed," he said. Hornell's leadership has been key in forming a Land Bank for Steuben County, a fund that supports the redevelopment of abandoned properties, something Foreman says he's an advocate for. The city's Codes Office has also ramped up enforcement effort with landlords and banks owning property. "It can be frustrating, because a lot of these properties are owned by banks that are hard to get to cooperate and bring these houses up to code, Foreman recognized. "That's our main concern." Foreman plans to run a restrained campaign in the coming months as he seeks the Democratic party line, instead relying on his long history of service.  "I'm going to continue doing what I do as far as being an Alderman and helping everyone that I can within my ward. It' won't be a door to door campaign because everyone knows me from the past 28 years and knows how to get a hold of me, so I'll keep it low-key," he said.  This year, state and local primary elections will be held on Sept. 12 if necessary, and the General election will take place on Nov. 7.

Tiffany Craig, KHOU 8:06 PM. CDT May 04, 2017 Are you tired of spending time at the grocery store? There's a shopping trend that might be right for you. CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST HOUSTON – Are you tired of spending time at the grocery store? There's a shopping trend that might be right for you. You order online and pick it up curbside. Some call it the future of food shopping. "It's convenient for us that's why we do it," shopper Laura Smith said. Vanessa Haines will tell you the same thing. She's a mother of four and works full-time. "I'm home in 30 minutes," said Vanessa. "I can't do that normally." Some of your favorite stores have a growing number of locations offering the service. H-E-B has Curbside. Walmart has Grocery Pickup and Kroger has ClickList. Jason Payne is with Kroger. "Customers absolutely love it," he said. The service appeals to parents, older folks and anyone with a disability. It also attracts shoppers who tend to overspend. "We hear from customers all the time that it's a money saving thing for them," explained Payne. "It keeps them from impulse buying." Kroger and H-E-B offer the first few uses for free and then the charge for a personal shopper is $4.95. "$5 is absolutely nothing compared to what I actually end up saving because I'm not buying random things by walking through the store," admitted Vanessa Haines. Walmart offers the service for free with a minimum purchase of $30. Even picky produce shoppers are in luck! You can describe how you want your fruits and vegetables. The only complaint we've heard is an occasional expiration date issue. "We're expecting a 3-5 day shelf life on these items and not for something to go out of date tomorrow," said Laura Smith. About 90 percent of what's in store is available online and the prices are similar. © 2017 KHOU-TV CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST JOIN THE CONVERSATION To find out more about Facebook commenting please read the Conversation Guidelines and FAQs Leave a Comment TRENDING VIDEOS Verify: Photo gone viral!

(WAVY) — One of the good Samaritans who helped Portsmouth officers arrest a resistant burglary suspect has been identified as a Coast Guard member. Coast Guard Petty Officer 1st Class Roger Brown was walking toward the exit of the Wal-Mart at 1098 Frederick Boulevard around 8:15 p.m. on April 27 with his car keys in one hand and a single bag in the other. The plastic bag contained frozen fruit that he planned to make a breakfast smoothie out of the next morning before he went to work at the Command, Control and Communications Engineering Center on Base Portsmouth. Before the automatic doors slid all the way open, Brown said he heard sounds of a scuffle and a voice yelling, “Get down, get down!” Outside, two police officers were wrestling with a man who had managed to pin on of the officers to the ground. Police said the suspect was punching the officer in the face. “It took me a second or two to realize what was happening,” said Brown. “Then I kicked off my flip-flops, threw my keys and my groceries down, and took action.” One of the officers was working part-time at the store that night when he recognized 32-year-old Clinton Pickens, who matched the description of a suspect wanted for burglarizing five local businesses between April 19 and 25.

Clinton T. Pickens (Photo: Portsmouth police) Another good Samaritan rushed over to assist Brown and the officers. Brown said the man restrained the suspect’s legs while the officers put him in handcuffs. “It all happened quickly, and I didn’t catch his name,” said Brown. “But he was a great help.” Detective Holley says Brown and the good Samaritan were key in resolving the situation. “The officer sustained minor facial injuries and bruising,” Holley said. “If Petty Officer Brown and the other good Samaritan hadn’t reacted so quickly, it could have ended up much worse.” Brown, who has served in the Coast Guard since 2003, said he originally joined looking for a change and a way to find direction in his life. While he now works as an electronics technician and provides technical support for Coast Guard cutter navigation systems, Brown previously served as a boarding team member aboard the 210-foot Cutter Resolute out of St. Petersburg, Florida. During his tour aboard the Resolute, Brown was part of law enforcement missions as a boarding team member. He went through countless hours of tactical training, which he said came in handy during the struggle with Pickens.

(Photo via U.S. Coast Guard) “It’s been a while since I’ve used those techniques,” he said. “But you never forget them.” But Brown said you don’t need tactical training to help police officers or others who are in trouble, you just need to act quickly and do what you can. “You’ve got to look out for your local law enforcement members,” said Brown. “You never know when you’re going to need their assistance in return. It all comes back around full circle.” Share this: Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Click to email (Opens in new window) Like this: Like Loading...

Ager Mohsin Hasan has been on the run since Friday after his girlfriend, Melinda Vasilije, was found stabbed to death in her apartment in Kitchener, Ontario. The couple were believed to have been in an on-again, off-again relationship, but the victims’ family says the pair recently split. On Tuesday, three days after Ms Vasilije’s death, an apparent confession was posted on social media. The note, which included details about how events unfolded, was seen by news.com.au but has since been deleted. It also included a number of photographs of the pair posted earlier to Snapchat and a text message exchange attributed to the couple. Police have confirmed they are investigating the post and it could be used as evidence. Meanwhile, the 24-year-old is still on the run. It’s believed he fled across the border to the United States, where a person matching his description was seen outside a Walmart in Pennsylvania in the hours after his girlfriend’s body was found. Police have urged him to turn himself in. Waterloo Police issued a statement to reporters on Tuesday. “At this point we believe that Ager Hasan is responsible for the death of Melinda Vasilijie and as such there is a Canada-wide warrant issued for his arrest on one count of second-degree murder,” an officer said. “Our major crime unit is dedicated to investigating this incident … we are continuing to liaise with our US counterparts to locate Hasan. “The families involved in this investigation have been very co-operative. “Right now our investigators are attempting to locate as much information as we can as to the whereabouts of Mr. Hasan. The information we have right now is that he is somewhere inside the United States.” In a statement to media, police said the post was being evaluated by investigators. “Information like this is potential evidence and, as such, needs to be authenticated and verified,” Waterloo Regional Police spokesman Michael Haffner said. “We don’t want to jeopardize that process and cannot comment any further on evidence. “We would continue to encourage Mr. Hasan to turn himself into U.S. authorities.” The 24-year-old’s brother, Jag Jamil, told local news station CTV Kitchener that he believes the post confessing to Ms Vasilije’s murder was made by the man police are pursuing while he has been on the run. But he said he did not believe his brother was guilty of murder. “I don’t believe he did that at all but I believe if he did that, it was in self-defense (because) I cannot see my brother doing that or intentionally doing that to anybody,” Jamil told the network. “He’s scared — he feels awful for what happened, he feels awful for Melinda’s family,” he said.

Investigators told media that three hours after Vasilije’s body was found, Hasan crossed the Peace Bridge from Ontario to New York State in a black Honda HR-V. About an hour later, a man matching his description was seen affixing stolen US license plates to the vehicle in the car park of a Walmart in Pennsylvania. In a GoFundMe account established to raise money for Vasilije’s funeral costs, friend Tia Wojteczko said the 22-year-old as a “beautiful woman.” “Melinda … didn’t deserve any of this. We want to remember her for all she was, she was kind, gentle, pure and sweet,” Ms Wojteczko said. “For all who knew her she had such an uplifting personality and made everyone around her happy. We will never forget her, her memory lives through all of us. “Rest in the sweetest peace Melinda Vasilije.” Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy Filed under canada ,  manhunts ,  murders ,  new york ,  social media ,  stabbings Share this article: Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy Read Next Trump touts 'great' relationship with Australia, honors ve...

Chinese grow wary of GMO Crushing blow? Chinese grow wary of GMO Posted Apr. 28th, 2017 by Reuters News Agency By Dominique Patton BEIJING, April 28 (Reuters) – A Chinese consumer backlash against genetically modified (GMO) crops is beginning to dent demand for soy oil, the nation’s main cooking oil, and could spell crisis for the multi-billion-dollar crushing industry, which depends on GMO soybeans from the United States and elsewhere. The effects on import demand are not yet an issue, but it could be in the future. The U.S. Departent of Agriculture expects China’s soybean imports from all sources will rise 5.7 percent in 2016-17 to 88 million tonnes. China: Vegetable oil food use, thousand tonnes. Source: USDA Crop year Soy Rapeseed Peanut Palm Sunfl’r Other Total ’16-17 16,000 8,350 3,052 2,900 1,325 1,281 32,908 ’15-16 15,300 8,350 2,887 2,800 1,379 1,272 31,988   The governments of China and other countries say GM foods are as safe as conventional foods, but wealthier urban Chinese consumers are replacing soyoil with oil processed from crops that have not been genetically modified, such as sunflower, peanut or sesame,. A Nielsen survey last year showed about 70 percent of consumers in China limited or avoided at least some foods or ingredients, compared with a global average of 64 percent, with 57 percent naming GMOs as undesirable. “Everyone says soyoil has GMOs,” said Mr Liu, a 70-year-old Beijinger, shopping with his wife in Walmart. “Better not eat too much. Apparently they’re not safe. It’s like those hormones. I’m just as afraid of eating GMOs as hormones.” That sentiment is already hurting retail sales. Supermarket sales of soy oil fell one percent last year to 35.7 billion yuan ($5.19 billion), data from Euromonitor shows, versus growth of between two and six percent for alternatives. “Non-GMO oil is gradually replacing (soy oil),” said Johnny An, supply chain director at food-service firm Aramark, which serves meals in banks, government offices and schools in more than 60 Chinese cities. ADVERTISMENT A few years ago, 10-20 percent of Aramark’s customers asked for oil from non-GMO crops, he said. Now it’s more than half. The mood is causing headaches for crushers, said Paul Burke, Asia director at the U.S. Soybean Export Council, forcing them to find new markets for their soyoil, though it had not yet had a noticeable impact on bean imports, as demand for soymeal used for animal feed, the larger byproduct of soybean crush, is still robust as China expands its livestock industry. PREMIUM PRODUCT The Nielsen survey found that more than four in five Chinese shoppers would be prepared to pay more for GMO-free products, and a 5-litre bottle of GM-free soy oil already sells at a 20 percent premium to oil produced from GMO soybeans, but that isn’t translating into a boon for the nation’s soybean crushers. China is the world’s top soyoil consumer – it will use 16 million tonnes this year – but the crushers rely on the United States and Brazil, which grow GM-soybeans, for 86 percent of China’s 84 million tonnes of soybean imports. In China, which does not permit planting of GMO soybeans, labour costs are high and productivity low on small farms, making non-GMO beans costly to grow. They sell for a third more than non-GMO beans planted elsewhere. Processors such as China Agri Industries, a unit of food and grains trader COFCO and one of the country’s top crushers, told Reuters it needs to improve its sourcing of non-GMO materials, to meet “escalating market demand”. In the meantime, processors are losing money as increased competition with other edible oils and a ballooning glut has pushed soyoil futures in China down 18 percent so far this year to multi-year lows. Some crushers are taking radical steps to find more GMO-free beans. Henan Sunshine Oils and Fats wants to buy as much as 37,000 acres of land in Ukraine to grow and process crops such as non-GMO soybeans, rapeseed and sunflowers, said Yang Renyi, group vice-president and general manager of the international affairs department. ADVERTISMENT Yang’s team made two trips to Ukraine last year to look into the feasibility of producing, storing and processing oilseeds there. “If we managed to get a large area of land to grow oilseeds, we possibly will spend at least 200-300 million yuan (US$29-$43 million) there,” said Yang. Non-GMO oils already account for a fifth of the firm’s sales since it started marketing the new offering late last year, he added. SHAKEN FAITH The shift in attitude against GMOs in China has been fuelled by social media and campaigning by high-profile personalities. The agriculture ministry has sought to assuage consumers’ fears, launching education campaigns and banning advertising that promotes non-GMO products as healthier. But years of food scares have shaken consumers’ faith in Beijing’s ability to guarantee the safety of the nation’s food supply. Cooking oil is a particularly sensitive topic after a scandal over the use of recycled oil known as gutter oil, a few years ago, so shoppers are wary. “Before everyone said soybean oil has GMOs, now the advertising is all about non-GMO soyoil. But we still don’t buy it,” said Maxine Li, a 28-year old bank worker, shopping at the same Walmart. “We think peanut oil is a bit healthier.   ADVERTISMENT Popular articles Farmers overcharged nearly $100 million in CGC… Survey reveals ‘amazing’ soil loss in Great… Police warn about illegal left turns Grain bag slashing angers farmer Genesis plans huge fertilizer supercentre west of… About the author Reuters News Agency — Also by this author USDA pig report likely will have little… EU nations vote against GM crops, but… U.S. corn, soybean harvests bigger than… RobertWager I find the attempts to convince people that China is not going full speed on GE crops a bit funny.

No one is forced to buy from Syngenta because it is a Chinese company. grinninglibber respond to market demands or die. Rob Bright Funny how it’s the wealthiest ctisens who are openly avoiding GMOs. Of course this two-tiered food supply issue is relevant to North America, too, simply because organic is priced so much higher here, and the only way to ensure you aren’t eating GE foods is to buy organic. At least in China they label GMOs by law. Here, in our so-called democracy, we aren’t allowed to know if our food is GMO or not. They simply refuse to label it, and our governments ignore the fact that 80% of citisens want them labeled.

LaVar, left, with Lonzo Ball after a UCLA game last season. Image: AP/REX/Shutterstock By Sam Laird2017-05-04 23:26:42 UTC The most infamous father in basketball is not unlike Donald Trump in that he's cracked the code to fame and relevance in these modern times.  Our latest example: The unveiling of Lonzo Ball's $500 signature sneaker on Thursday, weeks before the NBA draft and months before the young player will appear in an NBA game. Lonzo's signature shoe — released by his family's Big Baller Brand, not Nike or Adidas or even Under Armour — was widely roasted on social media.  But it's LaVar Ball who may yet have the last laugh.  SEE ALSO: Schea Cotton, the NBA All-Star who wasn't, is finally ready to tell his story When the "ZO2" line was unveiled online Thursday, it was immediately and thoroughly mocked on Twitter. And for good reason. The primary shoe costs $495 (and the Lonzo-autographed version is $995). Hell the flip-flops are $220 (and, yes, we wish we were joking.) The Sports World is Forever Changed. Introducing Lonzo's 1st Signature Shoe: The ZO2 Prime. pic.twitter.com/5JN1OLxlZS — Big Baller Brand (@bigballerbrand) May 4, 2017 Independence is Beautiful. We are proud to present the ZO2 Wet. . . . Signed By Lonzo | LED Box Included pic.twitter.com/OnaUCLlLZQ — Big Baller Brand (@bigballerbrand) May 4, 2017 & Lastly, The ZO2 Slide. pic.twitter.com/gyzHscfA3w — Big Baller Brand (@bigballerbrand) May 4, 2017 More ridiculous still, per the Big Baller Brand website, the shoes won't even be available until November 24. You can order them now, though — but be aware there are no refunds or exchanges. So, to recap: You can spend $495 for a shoe that won't arrive until at least November and you cannot return if it doesn't fit right.  Twitter, of course, got right to roasting.  Tell ya mom you want the $495 Lonzo Ball shoes. She'll get you the $175 Lebrons you actually wanted & tell you she heard they just as good. pic.twitter.com/lrz2YFPLIh — DJ Glamor Llama (@screwyoumegn) May 4, 2017 Lonzo Ball shoe price tho pic.twitter.com/ZYgKmfKs2h — Brandon Reid (@ReidBrandon9) May 4, 2017 Lonzo Ball introducing his first signature shoe. pic.twitter.com/BTDYV7D8N4 — Dylan (@DylansFreshTake) May 4, 2017 Shaquille O'Neal, whose signature shoes sell for cheap at Walmart, even joined the conversation with a shot at LaVar that was retweeted 27,000 times in two hours.  Hey @Lavarbigballer real big baller brands don't over charge kids for shoes. pic.twitter.com/N2U0VPXXyt — SHAQ (@SHAQ) May 4, 2017 Lonzo Ball is a point guard who just finished his one and only season at UCLA. He's all but assured to be a top-five pick in next month's NBA Draft and could indeed become a future star. LaVar, meanwhile, is Lonzo's dad.  LaVar shot to prominence toward the end of the UCLA season, when he gave bombastic interview after bombastic interview. He called out Lonzo's UCLA teammates, said he could've beaten Michael Jordan one-on-one back in the day, dissed LeBron James' kids. The list goes on. SEE ALSO: The most dad-ass dad sneaker of all time just became even more dad All of this became catnip to the media, with LaVar appearing again and again in national online, TV and radio outlets. LaVar sounds like a jerk if you believe the guy who coached his two younger sons in high school last season — but he won't shut up and the sports world just can't ignore him.  He's put a spell over the media and public in a way not unlike Trump did during last year's presidential election and Republican primary. Don't believe me?  While everyone was roasting Lonzo's shoes, they were also raising the visibility of LaVar's Big Baller brand. On what was a pretty massive news day in the real world, "Lonzo," "LaVar," and "#BigBallerBrand" were simultaneously three of the top seven Twitter trends in the U.S.  So yes, LaVar Ball has cracked to code to American fame in 2017:  Be loud. Be unapologetic.  Be bombastic.  Be controversial. And most of all, just be there, loudly, whenever the media calls and often when it doesn't. Sound familiar? All this helped get a reality TV star elected president not so long ago.  "You have to respect LaVar being entrepreneurial, betting on himself and trying to build a business," Jason Stein, CEO of the agency Laundry Service, told ESPN.com. "He's a larger than life character and generating a ton of attention. The shoes are nothing special and grossly overpriced, but I suspect that's intentional. In the context of building a brand — his brand — it's working." Time will tell if LaVar and the Balls can parlay infamy into dollars, but their pater familias certainly has the first part down. And, as former NBA star Stephon Marbury pointed out on Twitter, only 2,000 pairs of ZO2's need to sell to gross $1 million.   Paying $495 for some sneakers might seem ridiculous to you, because it is. But stranger things have certainly happened in these surreal times, where LaVar Ball is right at home.  WATCH: Get better, stress-free sleep with this weighted blanket Topics: Business, Entertainment, Sports About Us Jobs Advertise Subscribe Privacy Terms Mashable is a global, multi-platform media and entertainment company.

But that doesn’t mean you don’t earn bragging rights for lowering that number on the scale. Take it from Jessica Weber, a 23-year-old in Illinois who weighed 383 pounds at her heaviest, but has dropped 198 pounds in 15 months after overhauling her diet. PEOPLE reported that Weber, a Walmart associate, has been documenting her weight loss on Instagram to help others on the same journey stay positive. “I wanted to be open about it on Instagram because I wanted people to realize what obesity does,” Weber told PEOPLE. “That they can make changes, but they’ll also face problems with loose skin in all areas. I want people to not be scared, or feel hidden of what they accomplished after weight loss.” Weber told PEOPLE that she set out to lose weight after a heart-wrenching talk with her mom. “My mom actually started crying, and told me she thought I’d die before her,” she told the website. “It just hit me hard, and I knew I had to start losing weight. It became my motivation.” Weber transformed her body by following a low-carb, high-fat diet, but she has to remind herself daily of her mission. “So many people don’t understand that it’s a mental battle more than physical,” she told PEOPLE. Posting the first image of her slimmer body with excess skin also wasn’t easy, but, she told the website, her courageous move has paid off. “I was extremely nervous. I almost didn’t share [the photo] because I thought it would get so much hate,” she told PEOPLE. “I’m glad I did because I was overwhelmed with kindness and love.” PEOPLE reported that next, Weber will undergo a tummy tuck. But for now, she continues to rack up likes on her Instagram photos. One of her most popular posts from about two weeks ago has garnered 26,500 likes and counting. In the caption, Weber declares, “I will not hate my body anymore!” Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy Filed under diets ,  illinois ,  weight loss Share this article: Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy Read Next These popular vacation spots are death traps for Americans Read Next These popular vacation spots are death traps for Americans Share Selection Trending Now on NYPost.com 41,749 North Korean airline's meal sounds like the most disgusting thing ever 32,794 Matt Bomer on his family's 'radio silence' after coming out 27,901 Bad news for the Trump-Russia tinfoil-hat brigade Now On Inside Joe’s carefully planned proposal to Mika Paris Jackson lands seven-figure Calvin Klein deal Former BET head accuses ex-exec of discrimination SEE ALL Video Christina Milian and Amber Rose crash NYLON’s Young Hollywood Party Now On ‘Game Of Thrones’: HBO Exploring Multiple Spinoffs Of The Epic Fantasy Drama SEE ALL More Stories page six Matt Bomer on his family's 'radio silence' after coming out Now On Decider 10 Movies Where The Actors Had Real Sex On Camera nypost North Korean airline's meal sounds like the most disgusting thing ever New York Post Facebook Twitter Instagram LinkedIn Email Email Newsletters Mobile Apps Contact Us Tips Facebook Twitter Instagram LinkedIn Email Sections & Features News Real Estate Page Six Tech Sports Media Metro Photos Entertainment Video Business Alexa Opinion Covers Fashion Horoscopes Living Classifieds Newsletters & Feeds Email Newsletters RSS Feeds NYPost Store Home Delivery Subscribe Manage Subscription Preferences Help/Support Customer Service App FAQ & Help Contact Us Tips Newsroom Letters to the Editor Reprints Careers Apps iPhone App iPad App Android Phone Android Tablet Advertise Media Kit Contact Post Digital Network © 2017 NYP Holdings, Inc.

Home News Local Police continue search for murder suspect | 8 hours ago  |  Vote 0    0 Police continue search for murder suspect Ager Mohsin Hasan COLLISON, PETER,Police handout Ager Mohsin Hasan faces a second-degree murder charge in connection with Melinda Vasilije’s stabbing death next play/pause pre Waterloo Region Record By Liz Monteiro WATERLOO REGION — Waterloo Regional Police say the search continues for Ager Mohsin Hasan, the 24-year-old Hamilton man who faces a second-degree murder charge in connection with Melinda Vasilije's stabbing death. Police say the man fled to the United States a week ago, hours after Vasilije, 22, was found dead. "We are continuing to connect with our U.S. (law enforcement) partners, and we urge Mr. Hasan to turn himself in," Insp. Mike Haffner said Thursday. Vasilije was stabbed multiple times and found inside her apartment at 38 Country Hill Dr. at about 3 a.m. last Friday morning. Hasan's last known reported whereabouts were in Erie County, Penn., on April 29 where a man matching his description was seen switching licence plates in a Walmart parking lot. He has not been seen by law enforcement since. Police say Hasan was in contact with Vasilije that night. The two had been in a relationship for about a year, police said. Hasan had been ordered to not enter Waterloo Region and not make contact with Vasilije after he was charged with an alleged break-and-enter and two alleged assaults at her Country Hill Drive apartment on April 3, Haffner said. In addition to the second-degree murder charge, Hasan has also been charged with three counts of breach of recognizance as part of a Canada-wide warrant. The latter charges stem from the "domestic-related incident" in early April, Haffner said, adding that Vasilije was not a victim to the alleged assaults. Police believe Hasan is in the U.S. because a vehicle matching the description of Ager's 2016 black Honda HR-V was photographed crossing the U.S. border at the Peace Bridge just before 6 a.m. on April 29. Hasan's last known sighting by police was at a Walmart parking lot in Erie County just after 10 a.m. that same day. In video footage, a man was seen removing a Pennsylvania state licence plate from a parked vehicle with the number EZV1654 and a police medallion attached to it, according to Pennsylvania State Police. The man was then seen attaching the stolen licence plate to a black Honda HR-V. Police are now looking for a black Honda HR-V with two possible licence plates. The other one is an Ontario plate marked BPKT509. Hasan's mother, Sozan Jamil, said Thursday she still hasn't heard from her son despite numerous emails and texts to him. Anyone with information about Hasan or his whereabouts is asked to call Waterloo Regional Police at 519-653-7700, ext. 8666. lmonteiro@therecord.com Twitter: @MonteiroRecord Liz Monteiro can be reached via Twitter @MonteiroRecord | Latest News Business Facebook hack was ordeal for Holy Guacamole Snapshot Local ‘Nonchalant’ response to security breach Snapshot Local Police continue search for murder suspect Snapshot Local Restaurant’s plans on hold while region works out rules for patios near LRT Snapshot PHOTOS AND VIDEOS View All Photos View All Videos News St. Patrick's Day on Ezra Avenue News Shooting ArtsEntertainment PHOTOS: Grammy Awards red carpet Video Re-Enactment Video The Hot List: Top 10 cottage rental locations in Ontario Sponsored content Most Read SEE MORE Average house price in Kitchener and Waterloo soars 40 per cent Police say no foul play in death of woman in Kitchener With debts mounting, Verdun declares bankruptcy YouTube parents who pulled disturbing ‘pranks’ on their kids have lost custody Canadian detained in death of woman in Belize In Your Neighbourhood Today Central Automotive is a full-service auto shop and used car dealership Kitchener’s Central Automotive Service is known to be an outstanding full-service automotive repair...

(AP) — Seven bounty hunters who descended on the wrong car outside a Wal-Mart have been indicted on first-degree murder charges in the killing of an unarmed man and the wounding of another, Tennessee police announced Wednesday. The charges come after a chaotic scene in Clarksville on April 23, where police said the bounty hunters shot at the four people in the sedan and chased them for seven miles. Not one of the men in the sedan was wanted on outstanding charges. In fact, the Clarksville bounty hunters were looking for someone else, and there is no indication that any of the victims fired at the defendants or were even armed, police spokesman Jim Knoll said in an email. Bail bondsmen are empowered to hire or act as bounty hunters to bring in people who violate the terms of jail bonds, but they can’t use deadly force unless it’s self-defense. Killed was 24-year-old Jalen Johnson, a father of three from Clarksville. His family called him an innocent man who died in an act of terrorizing violence. Johnson’s uncle, Toni Jenkins, told The Associated Press that his nephew and the three men in the car with him had no idea why people would suddenly block their car in the Wal-Mart parking lot. Fearing an attack by gang members, they tried to flee. The bounty hunters, Jenkins said, started shooting in the parking lot and continued to fire on them during the chase, even ramming the Nissan along the way. Clarksville police would not confirm or deny these details, but authorities have said they are troubled by how the bounty hunters put people at risk. The Montgomery County grand jury charged all seven men with first-degree felony murder, three counts of attempted second-degree murder, three counts of especially aggravated kidnapping, attempted especially aggravated kidnapping, four counts of aggravated assault, employing a firearm in commission of a dangerous felony and felony reckless endangerment, police said. Some of the men charged were bonding agents and others were strictly bounty hunters, Knoll said. The men charged include: William L. Byles, 31; Kenneth Chiasson, 38; Antwon D. Keesee, 32; Jonathan Schnepp, 31; Roger D. West, 31; Prentice L. Williams, 34 and Joshua Young, 27. They do not yet have court dates or attorneys listed, the Montgomery County Circuit Court Clerk’s office said. All the men are from Clarksville, a city about 50 miles (80 kilometers) northwest of Nashville near the Kentucky state line.

By Josh Kolm 12 hours ago One of the most common applications for chatbots as they boom in popularity is their ability to make product recommendations tailored to a customer’s preferences. But sometimes customers just need the personal touch only a human can provide. Women-focused product review platform ChickAdvisor has been developing a new platform called “Ask A Pro.” It allows consumers to use mobile chat platforms to connect with a member of the company’s massive network of influencers, and have a conversation to determine which of a brand’s products best suit their needs. ChickAdvisor launched the pilot of “Ask a Pro” for Skin Care Awareness Month in April, focusing on L’Oreal Paris’ line of skincare products. Customers were introduced to the program either by clicking on a banner ad or texting a number shown on in-store signage at retailers like Shoppers Drug Mart and Walmart across North America. That would open a web-based chat interface that would  connected them with one of roughly 180 ChickAdvisor reviewers who were experts in skincare and had experience working in a beauty retail environment. The reviewers were equipped with the Ask A Pro app, which notified them when a customer was looking for advice. While the experts were using the app – similar to how an Uber driver is notified when there’s a nearby ride request – customers can use whichever interface was most comfortable to them. L’Oreal opted to use the web-based chat activated through SMS and banners, but Alex de Bold, co-founder of ChickAdvisor, says the platform can be connected to any chat platform the brand wants to activate in, like Facebook Messenger or WhatsApp. Being channel-agnostic is an efficient approach for companies like L’Oreal Paris, which has products meant for women of all ages who may have different levels of comfort with different platforms. De Bold says roughly 60% of the site’s traffic comes through mobile. The company has been working for the past two years on a strategy to help connect customers with personalized information from a live expert to give another option to shoppers who were already reading reviews while in a store aisle. That kind of tailored recommendation is especially useful in categories where a regular product review or even a chatbot might not be able to provide all the information relevant to the context and needs of each individual. “Ratings and reviews are so important for every single brand because customers want a subjective point of view on what they’re buying,” de Bold says. “By giving brands access to ratings, reviews, and now a real person who can personalize and contextualize information, we’re helping brands keep people in-store or online in their customer experience.” That’s not to say, however, that utilizing the benefit of a human expert means turning your back on bots altogether. L’Oreal – a longtime client of ChickAdvisor that worked to help pilot “Ask a Pro” – has also been investing in AI and chatbots, including a recent partnership with Montreal’s Automat to create a series of Facebook Messenger bots as a test-and-learn project. Further to that goal, De Bold says one of the long-term benefits of a program like “Ask A Pro” is in phase two of the project, where it feeds information about the questions customers are likely to ask and the best answers to serve their needs into a database, which can then be used to inform an AI-powered recommendation platform or chatbot. “Chatbots could be channel agnostic, but the problem is when you’re launching a new product, there’s no pre-existing information,” de Bold says. “Give it one question it can’t answer and it falls off the rails. This kind of program can prime a chatbot for a new product, and using human experts along the way can continue to make it stronger and faster along the way.” “It’s a huge pain point for brands,” de Bold says. “Traditional brand planning is channel-centric.

More Comments LinkedIn Tumblr Pinterest Digg FarkIt StumbleUpon The night of April 23, a group of bounty hunters and bail bondsmen in Clarksville, Tennessee, tracked a black Nissan sedan to a Walmart parking lot on the edge of town. A wanted man was riding in the car, or so they thought, according to police. So when the timing was right, the seven of them converged on the vehicle and tried to snatch up their suspect. What happened next isn’t quite clear, but a struggle ensued and at least one of the bounty hunters opened fire, police said. The Nissan screeched out of the parking lot, and the bounty hunters gave chase in two cars of their own. Over the next seven miles, they continued to fire at the sedan and at one point rammed it from behind, the Associated Press reported. The pursuit ended when the driver pulled over, injured by the gunfire. A passenger, Jalen Johnson, had been shot as well. A 24-year-old father of three, Johnson died at a hospital shortly after, according to the Associated Press. Two other passengers made it out unharmed. The bounty hunters had the wrong people. Nobody in the car was suspected of a crime, police said. Nobody had outstanding warrants. Nobody was carrying a weapon. On Wednesday, a grand jury in Montgomery County, Tennessee, indicted all seven bounty hunters and bondsmen on counts of first-degree felony murder, attempted second-degree murder, kidnapping and several other charges, local media reported. He can’t get out of the casket, so they shouldn’t be able to get out on bond “After an exhaustive investigation, numerous man hours expended interviewing individuals, processing crime scenes, and sorting through statements and evidence, the information was presented to the grand jury for consideration,” Clarksville Police spokesman Jim Knoll told the Leaf-Chronicle. The grand jury also found that the four men in the Nissan had not committed any crimes. Most of the defendants are bounty hunters and others were bail bondsmen, although police didn’t specify the exact breakdown. They range age from 27 to 38. All are from Clarksville except one who is a resident of Nevada, reported the Leaf-Chronicle. Their bonds were set at $300,000 each, and all were booked in the Montgomery County jail, local media reported. Attorney information for the defendants wasn’t immediately available Wednesday. Emergency dispatchers started receiving calls for a shooting in progress at about 12:30 a.m. the night of the car chase, police said. Around that time, a few of the bondsmen involved called 911 and reported that the men in the Nissan were firing shots, according to the Leaf-Chronicle, which reviewed audio from the calls. After investigating, police said there were no indications that anyone in the car was armed or firing at the group. The Leaf-Chronicle tweeted: Bounty hunter told 911 he opened fire because he was shot at first in slaying of Jalen Johnson. Johnson, the passenger who died, had three young children. His uncle, Toni Jenkins, told the Associated Press that Johnson and his friends thought they were being attacked by gang members when the bounty hunters swarmed them in the Walmart parking lot. Related Two juveniles charges with arson in Tennessee wildfires that killed 14 and damaged thousands of buildings Another relative, Ronnie Milan, said he wished the judge had ordered the defendants held without bond. “He can’t get out of the casket, so they shouldn’t be able to get out on bond,” he told the Leaf-Chronicle. “He was 24 and healthy as a tree and now he’s dead and gone.” Debra Morehead, the grandmother of the driver who was injured by gunfire, said her grandson was grieving from the ordeal. “This has messed him up,” she told the Leaf-Chronicle. “He’s such a good kid.” Find National Post on Facebook Twitter Google+ Reddit Email Typo?

(Meghan Grant/CBC) A teenager who stabbed his mother 39 times because she insulted him and wouldn't give him money for a powwow was sentenced to four years in jail and three years of community supervision on Thursday.  The boy and his mother can not be identified because he was a youth at the time of the killing. Now 19-years-old, the young man pleaded guilty to second-degree murder last week. The mother and son had been out shopping on July 24, 2014. At a Walmart the teen wanted his mother to buy pegs for the tent he planned to bring to a powwow, according to an agreed statement of facts. He didn't realize she had already made the purchase.  The boy also asked his mother for money which she refused to give him. Brother found victim in 'blood soaked house' The mother called her son "worthless" and when they returned to their home, the boy took a knife from the kitchen and attacked. Neighbours heard the incident, followed by two days of silence, prompting them to alert the landlord who then had police check on the home. The mother's body was found in a pool of blood in the basement suite by police and the victim's brother.  Finding his sister's body in the "blood-soaked house" left "a hole left in my heart that will never be filled," he wrote in a victim impact statement real aloud in court on Thursday. "She was not only my sister, but my best friend as well."  Family members emotional   Crown prosecutor Cameron Jose originally gave notice that he would seek an adult sentence, but after negotiations with defence lawyer Rebecca Snukal, the pair agreed to propose the maximum youth sentence of four years in custody and three years of community supervision  Provincial court Judge Gary Cornfield accepted the joint submission.  "This is a crime that strikes at the core of our human existence," said Cornfield. The judge told the offender he was guilty of "killing somebody who you should have loved dearly." Several family members wept and held each other throughout the hearing. In their victim impact statements, many wrote about their fear that the 19-year-old will re-offend after he's released.  Originally, doctors found the teen mentally unfit to stand trial but a year later he was deemed fit. With credit for the time he's been in custody, the teen has just over a year left on his in-custody sentence.

Ager Hasan fled to the US hours after he allegedly killed Melinda Vasilije, 22, his girlfriend of one year, in a stabbing attack at her Kitchener, Ontario home on April 28, Global News reported. Since then, a Reddit post purportedly written by Hasan has surfaced. In it, the user Redasblue101 recalled pushing his girlfriend and grabbing a knife. The post, which includes photographs of the couple and screenshots of their text exchanges, also read: 'The amount of regret and sadness is beyond words. Everyone else is just reading or talking about it. I lived it, I was there. I did it.' Police are still trying to verify whether the Reddit post was written by Hasan. Ager Hasan (pictured) fled to the US hours after he allegedly killed Melinda Vasilije, 22, (left) his girlfriend of one year, in a stabbing attack at her Kitchener, Ontario home on April 28 Since then, a Reddit post purportedly written by Hasan has surfaced. In it, the user Redasblue101 recalled pushing his girlfriend and grabbing a knife Hasan is wanted for second-degree murder and three counts of breach of recognizance, Insp. Mike Haffner told Global News. The breaches of recognizance refer to a 'domestic-related incident' on April 3, when Hasan was arrested for two counts of assault during a break-and-enter.  While Vasilije was not a victim in that incident, Hasan was restricted from her town of Kitchener and barred from contacting her, according to the police.  Weeks later, the 22-year-old was found dead around 3am on April 28 after police responded to a 911 call. She suffered multiple stab wounds, and Hasan became a prime suspect.  But the 24-year-old had fled the country, and was last seen on April 28 stealing a license plate in the parking lot of a Walmart in Erie County, Pennsylvania, to replace the Ontario plate on his black, 2016 Honda.  Hasan was last seen on April 28 stealing a license plate in the parking lot of a Walmart in Erie County, Pennsylvania, to replace the Ontario plate on his black, 2016 Honda (pictured) According to a Reddit post titled 'Wanted for Kitchener murder my side', the couple had recently broken up and started patching things up again. When Hasan admitted to seeing other people while they were on a break, the two began fighting, according to the Reddit post. 'She started freaking out. Wouldn't say a word and just kept slapping me with tears in her eyes. Slaps turned into hits. I told her I was sorry but if she didn't stop I'd do something back. She didn't stop. I then stupidly pushed her, harder than I expected. She fell against the sink.' 'Almost out no where she grabs a knife by the sink. Initially I thought [she] was just going to hold it to try and tell me to leave. She doesn't. She comes at me in full force, aiming towards my face,' the Reddit post states. 'I tell her to stop. She doesn't, I tried grabbing the knife but ended up cutting my hands. After a few cuts I lost it. I freaked out, I was scared and in a state of shock.  'Never in a hundred years did I think she would use a knife against me. Out of shock and fear I grab one. I hit her with it, almost blindly. A few times. I didn't know what happened. I was confused, shocked and scared. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next PICTURED: The swollen, bloody mugshot of escaped prisoner...

Register now for CCJ Symposium! compliance Automating driver pay (part 1): the challenges of California labor laws, ELDs Aaron Huff | @AaronHuffCCJ | May 4, 2017 California’s labor laws have created an administrative headache and legal risks for carriers who compensate drivers using piece-rate pay structures. California has a reputation for passing controversial laws that are later adopted by other states and the federal government. Recent changes to its labor laws may be no exception. The laws created new administrative headaches and legal risks for California-based fleets with intrastate operations. And these challenges could spill beyond its borders. At the heart of the issue is piece-rate pay. While the industry standard for interstate fleets is to base driver pay on mileages, percentage-of-revenue, or flat rates for loads, the practice is under scrutiny by California courts for intrastate haulers. Since November, 2016, Wal-Mart, Schneider Logistics and XPO have been ordered to pay millions to settle class-action lawsuits. The lawsuits argue that labor laws require the fleets to account for all work-related activities in their pay structure, no matter if some activities — like fueling, vehicle inspections, waiting for dispatch, etc. — are not considered productive. Going to an hourly pay structure is not necessarily the solution. Fleets still have to relieve drivers from all duties for required meal and rest breaks, or otherwise pay drivers for the time. The state’s overtime laws are also complex. The 10-hour breaks drivers normally would log as off-duty can be counted as work if drivers have to stay with the vehicle. The state’s labor laws only apply to intrastate operations, at least for now. But the precedent has been set for requiring fleets to account for all time and activities in pay. On a national level, the electronic logging device mandate could be another impetus for restructuring driver pay to activity-based models. Over the next week, CCJ will have a series of articles on how fleets can use technology to automate driver pay. First is an inside look at how one private fleet supports activity-based pay. Automating activity pay Jerry Robertson, chief technology officer of BOLT software. ELDs can record more than on-duty and drive time. Drivers can also electronically record fueling, yard moves, weighing loads, vehicle inspections, loading and unloading, meetings with fleet managers and other activities. Fleets can use this and other data activity data from ELDs, telematics, mobile applications and various back-office software to automate their driver payroll systems. And the more driver activity and performance data fleets have, the more opportunities to innovate and create new pay programs and incentives. Activity-based driver pay is already common among private and for-hire fleets with dedicated pickup and delivery routes, explains Jerry Robertson, chief technology officer of Bolt, an Internet-based fleet management and dispatch software provider. Activity pay helps fleets stay competitive, and even exceed, pay from over-the-road operations that can offer more miles and no-touch freight, he says. Bolt software is designed to capture a lot of data on shipper and receiver delivery requirements as well as real-time data about the load — the miles, hours-of-service, arrivals and departures, etc. — by integrating with mobile fleet management systems, he says. With these data sources, fleets can use Bolt software to automatically compare driver activities and performance with their planned dispatch and routing in terms of miles, loads, stops, pickups, deliveries, fueling, dropped trailers, and more. The activity-based pay features of Bolt were a major reason why Mennel Milling Corporation of Fostoria, Ohio, chose to implement the software after using a different fleet management system. The company operates 70 trucks and delivers up to 200 different types of flour from six mills to customers in a Midwest and Eastern regional operation using dry van and bulk trailers. The trucks are stationed at select flour mills and elevators within the system. Mennel Milling Co. uses the Bolt software system integrated with its PeopleNet mobile platform to automate driver pay, says Jeremy Decker, transportation safety manager. Mennel Milling’s pay structure is different by region, by terminal and by the type of work drivers perform. Some drivers are paid straight mileage; that is “easy to keep track of,” says Jeremy Decker, transportation safety manager. Other drivers spend a lot of time loading and unloading. “In our pay package drivers are compensated for the hours they are putting in. That doesn’t mean they are given an hourly wage, but we calculate the hourly wage into a trip rate based on how long it takes, on average, to load or unload a trailer,” he explains. Trips that depart loaded and return empty to the same terminal pay a flat rate. For trips that do not return to the same terminal, the company pays drivers an open-ended flat rate. Decker says the rate is open-ended because it is flat for the first segment of the trip and then becomes mileage based for all subsequent pickups en route to the driver’s home terminal. In other words, Decker says driver pay is a series of partial flat rates. But time of day also comes into play. “If, for example, a delivery is scheduled and made after midnight on a Friday, a multiplier can kick in to assign additional value,” said Decker. “There are a lot of moving parts with our structure. We like how Bolt makes all of this easy for us, and eliminates extra paperwork and tracking on our end. And, our drivers like it too. They see the workflow and know how they get paid.” The software automates payroll by tracking the planned dispatch assignments and routes with the driver’s execution of those activities. The geo-fencing capabilities of the company’s PeopleNet mobile platform help to automate the workflow by capturing arrival and departure data for planned stops. As long as drivers complete their loads, as planned, the payroll is automated says Decker, who besides managing fleet safety administers the PeopleNet system and Bolt integration. “The integration between PeopleNet and Bolt was straight forward and we were able to get payroll set up with minimal effort,” he says. When Bolt starts working with fleets that have activity-based pay programs, “almost 100 percent are doing it with paperwork,” says Robertson, adding that within six months most payroll processes can be automated.

Chinese grow wary of GMO Crushing blow? Chinese grow wary of GMO Posted Apr. 28th, 2017 by Reuters News Agency By Dominique Patton BEIJING, April 28 (Reuters) – A Chinese consumer backlash against genetically modified (GMO) crops is beginning to dent demand for soy oil, the nation’s main cooking oil, and could spell crisis for the multi-billion-dollar crushing industry, which depends on GMO soybeans from the United States and elsewhere. The effects on import demand are not yet an issue, but it could be in the future. The U.S. Departent of Agriculture expects China’s soybean imports from all sources will rise 5.7 percent in 2016-17 to 88 million tonnes. China: Vegetable oil food use, thousand tonnes. Source: USDA Crop year Soy Rapeseed Peanut Palm Sunfl’r Other Total ’16-17 16,000 8,350 3,052 2,900 1,325 1,281 32,908 ’15-16 15,300 8,350 2,887 2,800 1,379 1,272 31,988   The governments of China and other countries say GM foods are as safe as conventional foods, but wealthier urban Chinese consumers are replacing soyoil with oil processed from crops that have not been genetically modified, such as sunflower, peanut or sesame,. A Nielsen survey last year showed about 70 percent of consumers in China limited or avoided at least some foods or ingredients, compared with a global average of 64 percent, with 57 percent naming GMOs as undesirable. “Everyone says soyoil has GMOs,” said Mr Liu, a 70-year-old Beijinger, shopping with his wife in Walmart. “Better not eat too much. Apparently they’re not safe. It’s like those hormones. I’m just as afraid of eating GMOs as hormones.” That sentiment is already hurting retail sales. Supermarket sales of soy oil fell one percent last year to 35.7 billion yuan ($5.19 billion), data from Euromonitor shows, versus growth of between two and six percent for alternatives. “Non-GMO oil is gradually replacing (soy oil),” said Johnny An, supply chain director at food-service firm Aramark, which serves meals in banks, government offices and schools in more than 60 Chinese cities. ADVERTISMENT A few years ago, 10-20 percent of Aramark’s customers asked for oil from non-GMO crops, he said. Now it’s more than half. The mood is causing headaches for crushers, said Paul Burke, Asia director at the U.S. Soybean Export Council, forcing them to find new markets for their soyoil, though it had not yet had a noticeable impact on bean imports, as demand for soymeal used for animal feed, the larger byproduct of soybean crush, is still robust as China expands its livestock industry. PREMIUM PRODUCT The Nielsen survey found that more than four in five Chinese shoppers would be prepared to pay more for GMO-free products, and a 5-litre bottle of GM-free soy oil already sells at a 20 percent premium to oil produced from GMO soybeans, but that isn’t translating into a boon for the nation’s soybean crushers. China is the world’s top soyoil consumer – it will use 16 million tonnes this year – but the crushers rely on the United States and Brazil, which grow GM-soybeans, for 86 percent of China’s 84 million tonnes of soybean imports. In China, which does not permit planting of GMO soybeans, labour costs are high and productivity low on small farms, making non-GMO beans costly to grow. They sell for a third more than non-GMO beans planted elsewhere. Processors such as China Agri Industries, a unit of food and grains trader COFCO and one of the country’s top crushers, told Reuters it needs to improve its sourcing of non-GMO materials, to meet “escalating market demand”. In the meantime, processors are losing money as increased competition with other edible oils and a ballooning glut has pushed soyoil futures in China down 18 percent so far this year to multi-year lows. Some crushers are taking radical steps to find more GMO-free beans. Henan Sunshine Oils and Fats wants to buy as much as 37,000 acres of land in Ukraine to grow and process crops such as non-GMO soybeans, rapeseed and sunflowers, said Yang Renyi, group vice-president and general manager of the international affairs department. ADVERTISMENT Yang’s team made two trips to Ukraine last year to look into the feasibility of producing, storing and processing oilseeds there. “If we managed to get a large area of land to grow oilseeds, we possibly will spend at least 200-300 million yuan (US$29-$43 million) there,” said Yang. Non-GMO oils already account for a fifth of the firm’s sales since it started marketing the new offering late last year, he added. SHAKEN FAITH The shift in attitude against GMOs in China has been fuelled by social media and campaigning by high-profile personalities. The agriculture ministry has sought to assuage consumers’ fears, launching education campaigns and banning advertising that promotes non-GMO products as healthier. But years of food scares have shaken consumers’ faith in Beijing’s ability to guarantee the safety of the nation’s food supply. Cooking oil is a particularly sensitive topic after a scandal over the use of recycled oil known as gutter oil, a few years ago, so shoppers are wary. “Before everyone said soybean oil has GMOs, now the advertising is all about non-GMO soyoil. But we still don’t buy it,” said Maxine Li, a 28-year old bank worker, shopping at the same Walmart. “We think peanut oil is a bit healthier.   ADVERTISMENT Popular articles Farmers overcharged nearly $100 million in CGC… Survey reveals ‘amazing’ soil loss in Great… Police warn about illegal left turns Grain bag slashing angers farmer Genesis plans huge fertilizer supercentre west of… About the author Reuters News Agency — Also by this author USDA pig report likely will have little… EU nations vote against GM crops, but… U.S. corn, soybean harvests bigger than… RobertWager I find the attempts to convince people that China is not going full speed on GE crops a bit funny.

No one is forced to buy from Syngenta because it is a Chinese company. grinninglibber respond to market demands or die. Rob Bright Funny how it’s the wealthiest ctisens who are openly avoiding GMOs. Of course this two-tiered food supply issue is relevant to North America, too, simply because organic is priced so much higher here, and the only way to ensure you aren’t eating GE foods is to buy organic. At least in China they label GMOs by law. Here, in our so-called democracy, we aren’t allowed to know if our food is GMO or not. They simply refuse to label it, and our governments ignore the fact that 80% of citisens want them labeled.

Social media has allowed us to get into horrible, typo–inducing, name calling, yelling at the screen, typing arguments with people we’ve never even met before. And it’s given us the magnificent ability to stay in touch with those people from high school who justify racist/homophobic/xenophobic/anti-science posts with explanations like, “I know I’m right because that’s just how I feel.” Who knew our utopian idea of the “information superhighway” would become more like a Walmart parking lot where your uncle gets too drunk and yells misogynistic things? Luckily you don’t have to tolerate this kind of hate if you don’t want to which is why I’m present the following guide on how to block those people from your life. Facebook This is really where a lot of the nastiest stuff goes down. I mean, there are just so many jackasses out there! On FB you have a few options. When someone posts something, you can click on the little down arrow looking thing in the top right corner of their post. There it gives you a few options, one of them being to unfollow said person. This makes it so that you’re still FB friends, but none of their crap will come up in your feed. Pretty 100! But that might not be enough because they can still see your stuff and message you. So the next step is to block their ass. To do this go to the little downward arrow that’s next to the question mark in the top right corner of any FB page. Then click on settings. Then on the left side click on the thing that says “blocking” and it will give you all the blocking options available. You’d be surprised how many there are! Twitter Twitter is another place where shit weevils come out of the woodworks to harass you. Luckily blocking them is super easy. Just go to their twitter page and find the “Follow” button on the right-hand side. Next to that are three little vertical dots. Click on that, then click the block option and poof! stupid alt-right Nazi nitwit can’t see that you called him a ******. Email Since most everyone is using Gmail, I’m just gonna explain it with that (sorrystuies@hotmail.com I still love you!). Blocking someone on email is super easy. Just open the message they sent you (containing the most unfortunate looking *insert eggplant emoji* pic in the world) then find the little down arrow in the top-right corner, and click “Block Stuart” or whoever’s name is in there. Phone Everyone has had at least one ex who send really insane things for months after you break up. It’s painful, heartbreaking, and sometimes just terrifying. So block that jerk! On an iPhone just go to their entry in your phonebook and scroll to the bottom. See that “Block this Caller” button? Push it. On Android, go to the recent calls list, find the dope’s number and hit “Block.” Same goes for the messages they send you. Congrats on now having way less negativity in your life. This is your moment of zen!

Tarek, who was laid off in November after the offshore job market hasn't recovered as fast as the onshore shale industry, is one of many highly trained professionals still looking for work. Tarek Ghazi, is photographed at the Offshore Technology Conference... Erin Donlon came to the Offshore Technology Conference for the first time this week, immersing himself in the world of deepwater drilling — a world that, until recently, he was sure he'd want to enter himself. The pay was great and the work seemed exciting, so when Donlon arrived at Maine Maritime Academy as the oil boom accelerated in 2013, he set his sights on oil rigs. Now, with the industry still shaking off the worst bust in 30 years, he considers himself fortunate that he's not graduating until December, hoping that more opportunities open offshore. "Once we had the [oil] recession, I thought, 'That's going to be interesting,'" said Donlon, 23, one of a handful students selected to attend OTC this year from his school in Castine, Maine. "A lot of people graduating this month, they're like, 'What can I do?'" That sense of guarded optimism was common among job seekers at OTC this year, as the oil industry's prospects have brightened somewhat, but not enough to lead to widespread hiring that would recover the more than 200,000 jobs cut in the United States after prices began their plunge at the end of 2014, according to the Labor Department. Only about 30,000 of those jobs have come back since the market bottomed last year, concentrated onshore in areas where oil and gas are cheaper to extract, particularly West Texas' Permian Basin and increasingly the Eagle Ford shale in South Texas. Renewed hiring has largely bypassed the offshore sector. Anthony Caridi, an oil and gas recruiter with the Houston firm QTSI, offered a grim assessment of the situation for those still looking for work. "Anything drilling is a no-go," he says. "Offshore is even more of a no-go." Another year of job help This marked the second year in which OTC tried to support displaced workers with networking events and workshops to help people polish their LinkedIn profiles and interviewing skills. A session Monday filled to capacity, with some people  looking to change jobs, recent graduates hoping to score their first positions and many others trying to get back on their feet. At a roundtable discussion about resume writing, human resources professional Metha Vasquez coached attendees on how to characterize jobs they might have taken outside their fields after a layoff: As "other experience" at the bottom of the page, with "relevant experience" at the top.

"A lot of people have been unemployed for a long time, and they're working at Walmart. That's not their career, they're paying the bills, that's okay." Another table focused on setting up consulting businesses. Companies cut mostly early-career employees during the national recession from 2007 to 2009, but the oil bust fell hardest on those with many years of experience who were too young to retire. Those older workers have the skills to win contracts with companies that might have hiring freezes in place, but still need to get certain projects done, according to Susan Howes, vice president of engineering at Subsurface Consultants and Associates of Houston. Her company puts together teams of technical professionals like geologists and petroleum engineers working as independent contractors to complete short-term projects for oil and gas companies.

Texanomics While oil and gas is rebounding, offshore jobs remain hard to Who are the winners and losers in Trump's tax plan? The bulk of Houston's "clean energy" innovation comes from oil Texas unemployment rate now convincingly back above America's What happened to Texas' other state-run venture capital fund? She was flooded with resumes during the bust, and most of those workers are still around. "I wouldn't say that the pool of applicants has contracted," Howes says. "There are still companies that are going through reductions in force, and there are people who are still looking, they've been looking for a while." That pool includes Tarek Ghazi, a geologist with 40 years of experience, 20 spent at ConocoPhillips before working for several other companies. He was laid off from a small reservoir data firm last November, and has had a few interviews since. But he remains philosophical about the experience, which he knows is inevitable in the boom-and-bust cycles of oil and gas. "I would never get discouraged, because that is the nature of the industry," he says. For that reason, he's careful not to get too excited about hints of a recovery. "I don't know if it is a real uptick, or a bunch of self-reinforcing rumors." Ghazi and others take solace in the company of others who've found themselves in between jobs, with new organizations like the Society of Petroleum Engineers' Members in Transition group and the Houston-centric Pay it Forward Networking Program, which coordinates tours and training sessions with energy companies to help people maintain their skills and make connections. Those support communities help ease the burden of unemployment, by making people realize they're not alone and the layoff wasn't their fault. Still, they can't create jobs that don't exist. Case in point: In late March, SPE held a career fair with 350 job seekers  and 15 employers. A month later, according to organizers, the companies have reported filling only two positions with people who attended the event. #OTC2017 Tweets Shifting needs Drilling companies are mostly waiting on oil prices to rise before shifting back into gear. But for unemployed energy workers, a recovery in production may not get them their jobs back. That's because companies are re-evaluating which jobs they need, and which can be replaced by automation. Among them: rig maintenance, which can be accomplished by robots piloted by operators onshore. "A lot of companies are looking at what the alternative might be to just plain rehiring," says Rachel Everaard, who leads the oil and gas human resources team for the consulting firm EY. "Certainly you're not going to replace all drillers with remote operations next year, but you'll start to see them hire fewer and fewer, as they start to do things differently." For now, the sluggish recovery hasn't dashed the hopes of young workers still hoping to break into the industry. Donlon, the Maine Maritime student, will graduate with a Coast Guard Unlimited license, allowing him to pilot ships, and he'd like to put it to work in oil exploration. Even if renewable energy and increasing fuel efficiency cuts into demand for some petroleum products, Donlon expects that other products, such as petrochemicals, will keep the oil and gas industry vibrant. "The oil industry pretty much runs everything and 'I'd like to be part of something where I can have an impact," said Donlon. "It's a waiting game, for now. There's definitely hope."

Fidget spinners are just the latest dull, mind-numbing toy—a trend caused by economic forces, with consequences for kids Adrian Lee May 4, 2017 Follow @AdrianKLee Twitter Facebook Google+ Share LinkedIn Reddit Email   Fidget spinners. (Revo Toys) Children’s toys are typically not so exciting; they’re often riffs off the latest big movie or TV show, or gussied-up versions of old reliable games and toys. But the latest toy fad might just leave your head spinning. Fidget spinners—a tripartite ball bearing studded with three weights that reels around with a flick of the finger—are the latest toy trend, found pinched in the hands of kids (and adults) around the world. In the last few months, they’ve become ubiquitous among the younger set, turned into toys as videos of fidget spinner tricks and Reddit communities gain fans in the thousands; they’ve been banned in swaths of schools; studies have been issued and rebutted over whether kids playing with fidget spinners are actually productive in increasing focus in classrooms. FROM TODAY’S PARENT: Why teachers hate fidget toys Let it first be said that the retroactive justifications from parents and scientists that the spinner may improve focus—that somehow giving a child a toy helps them do one thing easier—feels like someone endorsing weeks-old takeout, just because it didn’t give you food poisoning last time. Let it also be said that trusting kids in their claims that toys help them focus is a child-pushed argument that’s so brazen that 12-year-old me—who would lay out my case to my parents that buying Pokemon cards was actually some kind of fiduciary investment with the potential for high returns on the resale market—can’t help but stand and applaud. But its role as a focus-stealer isn’t the fidget spinner’s true sin. It’s that they are mind-numbingly boring. Ball-bearing tools have been around since ancient Rome. They’re in your boring computers; they’re in your boring engines; they’re in your boring bikes, and your boring kitchen appliances. If we’re co-opting basic tools as toys, we might as well just rebrand them into Riveting Rivets and Ronnie the Wrench so kids can get to work in literal Fun Factories. Even the argument that they are effective productivity devices actually hinges on the idea that they are boring—the physical equivalent of a white noise machine. Here is an adult man, in one of the more popular YouTube videos about fidget spinners, forlornly considering what went wrong with his life to get him to this place. But fidget spinners are really just the latest in a long line of boring toy trends to dominate kids’ minds. Before the spinning whirr came the incessant kerplunk of kids trying to flip plastic bottles with a little water in them so they landed upright; though the bottles were half-full, the spirit of the activity was surely half-empty. Before that, there were hoverboards—massive deceptions, given that they were just non-hovering segways made more dangerous by the deletion of a support pole—and, of course, Hatchimals, lauded by the industry, with awards like the 2017 Innovative Toy Of The Year award at the prestigious New York Toy Fair. But even they were just a massive coup of rebranding, a more irritating Kinder Surprise without any of the pleasures of eating chocolate that basically becomes a Furby. And once it’s born, the Hatchimal just makes needy demands that require disproportionate time and energy. Where’s the fun in that? (On this, parents might feel some common ground.) MORE: The lessons for investors in the hype and fall of Hatchimals But there’s more here than the mere fact that I, an ostensible adult, can’t get behind toys for kids these days. There’s a greater potential cost—one that’s much less an indictment of our children, and says more about the lack of innovation and creativity in the industries helping to shape their young minds. After all, a vast array of studies show that playing—an act that will invariably involve toys—fosters social and cognitive skills, while cultivating creativity and imagination among younger children. And according to a report from Sarah M. Fine, of Harvard’s Graduate School of Education, “intellectual playfulness” remains a valuable thing to cultivate for high-school aged students, often the ones playing with water bottles and spinners. “Playful learning in adolescence is certainly not the same thing as playful learning in early childhood … But this does not mean that it is any less important,” she writes. “To the contrary, finding ways to support adolescent learners in learning playfully is more critical because it is less intuitive.” Kids’ toys should meet these needs—to encourage creativity, to focus on play value, to be better. “When I was designing toys, I would either go for something that was emotionally endearing to a child, or have play value—and ideally, I always wanted to have my toys teach kids something,” says Canadian inventor Wayne Fromm, whose own creations include the popular Beauty and the Beast Magic Mirror and who was a leading marketer of Crazy Bones. “Do these spinners teach kids anything? I’m not sure.” The fact that current toys aren’t doing that is a reflection of ongoing shifts in the toy industry, he says. Physical toys are appealing to a narrower slice of children as iPads and apps are introduced to younger and younger kids, says Fromm: “They outgrow the concept of having a physical toy earlier.” That trend hasn’t spurred significant changes to how toys are sold, either; a small concentration of toy creators and distributors is actually working to staunch true toy innovation to meet these evolving terms, much in the way that major movie studios are content to produce sequel after sequel, loath to try new things when comfortable profits are at stake. “I’ve created many toys, and I would take them to the executive panel of Toys R’ Us and Walmart, and if they weren’t going to buy that product, that product wasn’t going to get made—there was no point,” says Fromm. “Doesn’t mean the toy wasn’t good, it just means the big-box stores weren’t going to support it, and now everything has to be vetted by all the big players—Hasbro, Mattel, Spinmaster.” And so, with the industry centralizing into a few massive leaders—a 2013 report found that the top five U.S. toy companies hold more than 50 per cent of the market—companies producing physical toys are now leaning more than ever on the success of a strong few. When Mattel reported declining revenues in 2014, its CEO was clear about why: “We just didn’t sell enough Barbie dolls.” Kelly Ingram reacts while receiving a Hatchimal, a top toy of the season, at Walmart’s Black Friday event in Bentonville, AR on Nov. 24, 2016. (Gunnar Rathbun/AP Images for Walmart) Indeed, the fact that the market remains loaded with toys that are specific to boys and girls—homemaking toys and princess dolls advertised to girls, cars and industrious construction toys for boys—is tied into the forces behind the innovation drain. Despite studies suggesting that targeted toys helps hem boys and girls into prescribed gender roles by influencing career choices, those big-box stores are only now seeing the capitalist value of challenging those stereotypes. Indeed, the first offerings from Debbie Stirling, the founder of GoldieBlox—now one of the industry’s hottest names, selling toys aimed at inspiring an affection for sciences among girls—were rebuffed by bigwigs at the New York Toy Fair, the make-or-break hub and haven for the latest in toy trends. “They said girls don’t like engineering. Girls don’t like building. That’s a boy play pattern. Girls want to be princesses, they want to play fashion. Go look at the pink aisle,” she said in an interview with Public Radio International. There is one upside, perhaps, to at least the fidget spinner and the water-bottle flipping: it seems bad toys are forcing kids to find fun in other ways, like finding water (or in this case, flipped water bottles) in the desert. It feels like an active outgrowth of actual toys failing to make a mark on youth, causing kids to make do with what they have around—empty bottles, cheap ball-bearings—rather than the staid items being marketed at them. And it might be something the toy industry should consider as a warning sign; while toy sales continue to grow—Canada’s sales rose six per cent, to just over $2 billion—the actually number of toys sold are roughly flat, a quiet sign of a deteriorating market. It represents a disruption to the field that could loosen the grip of those big-box retail stores—and make innovation easier to achieve. After all, a non-toy improvisation was the initial inspiration for the original fidget spinner, created by a British inventor who was injured while caring for her young daughter. “I couldn’t pick up her toys or play with her much at all, so I started throwing things together with newspaper and tape then other stuff,” she said in The Guardian. “It wasn’t really even prototyping, it was some semblance of something, she’d start playing with it in a different way, I’d repurpose it.” Maybe that’s the best way to spin this latest trend—that children, failed by an unadventurous toy industry, have turned tchotchkes into playthings, so they can play on anyway. And good for them. After all, we must move forward, not backward; upward, and always twirling, twirling, twirling toward innovation.

Police say when an employee told her the bills were fake and wouldn’t be given back to her, Wallace grabbed the bills and tried to take off. Police located Wallace in the Walmart parking lot and arrested her. Wallace is charged with robbery, criminal attempt to commit larceny, interfering with an officer and breach of peace.   Share this: Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Click to email (Opens in new window) Like this: Like Loading...

Warren's Hearing Aid Gambit Helps Big Business, Harms Patients Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) speaks during a rally in front of the Capitol March 22, 2017, in Washington, D.C. (Alex Wong/Getty Images) By George Landrith Thursday, 04 May 2017 10:54 AM Current | Bio | Archive Close  More ways to share... Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    When I heard that Sen. Elizabeth Warren had introduced the "Over the Counter Hearing Aid Act of 2017" claiming that she wanted to create an all new over-the-counter (OTC) category for personal sound amplification products (PSAPs), I knew something disingenuous was afoot. Sen. Warren has not been a champion of deregulation or of making government less intrusive. So I dug a little deeper, and found that Warren’s bill expands the power of federal bureaucrats, eliminates state authority, and reduces consumer access to amplification devices by making them more expensive and highly regulated. That’s not how she advertises the bill, but that’s how it would be described if truth in labeling laws applied to Congress. Today, without her proposed law, there are PSAPs legally available at Best Buy, Walmart, and thousands of other stores and outlets for very reasonable prices. Anyone can buy these devices. They simply amplify sound — some use them for bird watching, others to snoop on conversations that are ordinarily out of ear shot. These PSAPs are different from medical hearing aids in that hearing aids are designed for people who have measurable hearing loss and require a doctor to help determine the cause of the hearing loss and the most appropriate way to correct the problem. All hearing loss isn’t the same. So doctors play an appropriate role in helping the patient find and tailor the right solution. These medical hearing aids are not used for snooping or songbird listening. They are specifically tailored to the patient. The bottom line is that PSAPs are not medical hearing aids and they don’t need to be regulated like medical hearing aids. But Sen. Warren wants to subject PSAPs to FDA regulation and explicitly lock states out of any role in the process, and then designate these PSAPs as available "over-the-counter" as if that were some big new innovation — conveniently failing to mention that they are already available to anyone at thousands of stores. So what is Sen. Warren really up to? It appears that Sen. Warren is working at the behest of big corporations who feel they could make more money selling PSAPs if they were regulated because that would make them seem more “big time” and “high tech” and make them seen more like medical hearing aids. That would allow them to charge more and give them new marketing material. In fact, Bose, the famous speaker maker, markets a relatively expensive PSAP called “HearPhones.” They are located in Sen. Warren’s home state. These amplification devices aren’t medical hearing aids, but they could pretend to be “quasi” hearing aids with Sen. Warren’s new bill. That’s the real goal — more sales, higher prices, and more profits for Bose and other corporations. But Sen. Warren’s bill will do nothing to give consumers and patients greater access or lower prices. And it certainly won’t lead to more innovation. A new layer of regulation is not a stimulator of innovation — it squashes innovation. What it will do is empower federal bureaucrats and lead to poorer healthcare by eliminating the doctor-patient relationship in finding the right hearing aid and tailoring it to the patient’s needs. Without a doctor’s input, serious hearing problems can go undiagnosed and if untreated, options can be forever lost. Another downside to designating something over-the-counter is that insurance and Medicaid coverage usually cease to cover them. So in Sen. Warren’s zeal to confer a regulatory benefit upon a few well-heeled corporations hoping for bigger profits, she is willing to endanger coverage for legitimate medical hearing aids to those who need them most — including many veterans with hearing loss due to combat injuries. So while Sen. Warren makes it sound like she wants to spur innovation, reduce costs, and improve patient access to hearing aids, she isn’t shooting straight. In fact, she is doing the exact opposite. It is a great con. A lot like when she claimed she was a Native American to help her land a great job at Harvard. The truth wasn’t important. She wove a story — even though false — to benefit her. Likewise, truth is the first casualty with her fake Over the Counter Hearing Aid Act. She benefits big corporations and big government, not consumers or patients.

Brian Emfinger, a reporter for CNN affiliate KATV, took aerial images and video of flooding near Pocahontas, Arkansas, in the northeastern part of the state, where floodwaters overtopped a levee. Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson posted an aerial photo of a Walmart in Pocahontas surrounded by water, as well as the flooding that has impacted roads nearby. In the past week, flooding has caused seven deaths in Arkansas, including a 10-year-old who was climbing a fence to avoid the water and was swept away, according to the Arkansas Department of Emergency Management. Five people have died in Missouri, officials there said. St. Louis area flooding A large area of eastern Missouri and southern Illinois remained under flood warnings on Thursday morning. The flooding impacted more than 100 highways in the St. Louis region, according to Tom Blair, an official with the Missouri Department of Transportation. The Meramec River, which travels through the suburbs of St. Louis, rose to a new record of 46.11 feet on Wednesday after weeks of heavy rainfall. The river does not have a reservoir, so flash-flooding and localized flooding is common, Russell Errett with the Army Corps of Engineers told CNN affiliate KMOV. Residents piled up sandbags to protect their homes and businesses. Shayna Kremer took several photos in Pacific, Missouri, another city along the Meramec River, on Tuesday evening showing streets flooded in all directions. Blair encouraged Missouri residents to follow road closures and warning signs and to not drive around barricades. "We're getting close to the end," he said. "Please keep it up a little bit longer." Illinois is next Meanwhile, residents of central and southern Illinois prepped for their own coming floods as rain continued to fall. The Mississippi River near Cape Girardeau in southern Illinois is projected to reach 48.5 feet on Sunday, just below its record high of 48.9 feet. The Illinois Emergency Management Agency enlisted inmate crews from the Department of Corrections to sandbag communities expecting rising floodwaters. In Villa Grove, toward the eastern part of Illinois, officials said they had prepared boats for possible rescues and police were ready to block off streets in case of flooding, according to CNN affiliate WCIA. Traci Belshe, who lives in Villa Grove, told WCIA that previous flooding has caused more serious issues. "We've had people trapped in their homes, having to be boat rescued out while that gas leak is occurring," Belshe said. "I myself have been trapped in this home three different times."

Retail stores are closing this year at a pace unseen since the Great Recession. Diedra Laird The Charlotte Observer Business May 04, 2017 1:38 PM The loss of retail jobs is only going to get worse in Charlotte By Katherine Peralta kperalta@charlotteobserver.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Charlotte is hemorrhaging retail jobs, and the bleeding isn’t expected to let up anytime soon. Pressured by the competition from online retailers like Amazon, retail companies have grappled with a slowing of customer traffic in their stores over the years. But stores are closing this year at a pace unseen since the Great Recession, experts say. Charlotte, like other big markets, will continue to see stores shutting their doors until retailers achieve what they consider a sustainable number of brick-and-mortar locations. And when stores close, the dozens of employees who staff them must also find work elsewhere. The list of national chains that have announced store closures in the Charlotte metro over the last year is growing: Macy’s, J.C. Penney, Hhgregg, Bebe, Hollister, The Limited, J. Crew, BCBG Max Azria, Wal-Mart Neighborhood Market, Kmart, Kohl’s, Wet Seal. It’s hard to tell – especially on the local level – exactly how many people have lost jobs because of recent closures. For one, retail employment is made up of a mix of full-time and part-time workers. Retail companies are also often reluctant to disclose job losses on the individual store level. But the loss of retail jobs still stings. That’s especially true for low-income workers who make up a large portion of the store-level workforce, and who might have a difficult time traveling far to find work elsewhere, said Mark Cohen, the director of retail studies for Columbia Business School and a former executive at Sears Canada and other department stores. “At the end of the day, this is kind of a slow-rolling crisis that doesn’t have a solution really because these folks can’t relocate, can’t likely commute long distance, don’t have marketable skills,” Cohen said. When 100 or so people lose their jobs when a Macy’s closes, for example, Cohen said, it may be hard for that many people to find similar work nearby. The trend is going to accelerate, he added. “The number of store closings has reached a level we haven’t seen since the recession and in 2017, it’s going to exceed that,” Cohen said. “The crisis in brick and mortar is the reckoning everyone knew was coming. There are too many malls, too many stores, too much square footage.” Everything must go At the Hhgregg store near Northlake Mall, all the merchandise is being liquidated as the company prepares to close all 220 of its stores nationwide. Dishwashers are an additional 25 percent off their already discounted price, gas ranges are 40 percent off and washing machines are 30 percent off. The Northlake-area store used to employ roughly a dozen people, but that number has been whittled down to about four, as rumors began to swirl about the company’s failure to find a buyer of the business, according to one full-time employee who asked to remain anonymous. The employee has worked at the Hhgregg location for about nine months. “There are ups and downs in retail,” said the employee, though the interviews she’s had for new positions were at Spectrum and a position at a group home. According to Federal Reserve data, the Charlotte-Concord-Gastonia metro employed 28,100 people in general merchandise sales in March, up from 23,000 a decade ago. The total number of people working in retail has been relatively flat over the last three years, however, and is actually down slightly from 28,200 in March 2014 – suggesting retailers have slowed their pace of hiring here.   In a report released Thursday, the research firm Challenger Gray & Christmas said retail led all industries with job cuts in April. The retail industry cut 11,669 jobs nationwide last month, bringing the year-to-date total to 50,133. That represents a 36 percent increase in the sector this year compared with the same four-month period a year ago. Stephen Cox, a marketing professor at Queens University in Charlotte, said retail employment may start to shift from one kind of company to another. “Retail sales overall are not dropping, it’s just the big retailers. I think what we will see is a movement from working in big retail stores to working in smaller, specialized ones. Headquarters jobs cut The decline of retail jobs also goes beyond those at the store level. The Charlotte area was once hotbed for retail corporate headquarters, but thousands of those high-paying jobs have been slashed, too, amid industry challenges. Belk, which was bought by private equity firm Sycamore Partners in 2015, late last year laid off dozens at its headquarters on Tyvola Road. A month after laying off nearly 2,400 full-time workers at stores across its U.S. footprint, Lowe’s cut 430 corporate jobs at its headquarters in Mooresville earlier this year, and another 70 in Wilkesboro. Dollar Express laid off 110 people at its Charlotte corporate office in March after owner Sycamore Partners decided to sell the chain to Dollar General. Another 3,000 store-level jobs could be lost nationwide when the deal closes. Dollar Tree said last August it was cutting 370 jobs at the former corporate headquarters of Matthews-based Family Dollar, which it acquired last year. And amid sluggish sales, apparel retailer Cato last month laid off nine in its real estate department in Charlotte. Losses of jobs at traditional retailers could, at least in some part, be partially offset by Amazon’s growing presence in the Charlotte area. The metro area’s place as a transportation hub, namely with Charlotte Douglas International Airport, has made it a growing e-commerce hub, too. Amazon is notoriously quiet about its local hiring plans. But the online retail giant is expanding its receiving center in west Charlotte, the Observer reported last August. The Seattle-based company also has distribution center in Concord, where it employs about 360 people.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    The American grocery store has so far been mostly immune to the ravages of online shopping and the all around apocalyptic outlook facing the nation's retailers. But a war is coming to the staid supermarket, and that could mean more consolidation, bankruptcies, and falling prices. An invasion is getting under way. Lidl, a German retailer known for low prices and efficient operations, is expected to start an aggressive U.S. expansion in the coming weeks that could open as many as 100 new stores across the East Coast by the summer of 2018. The company, which runs about 10,000 stores in Europe, has also set its sights on Texas, one of the most competitive grocery markets in the U.S. Analysts expect Lidl to expand to nearly $9 billion in sales by 2023. The last thing U.S. grocers need is more cutthroat competition. As the ranks of U.S. grocery stores have swelled, food has become a way for struggling brick-and-mortar retailers such as dollar stores and pharmacies to compete for customers. Even though groceries have been somewhat insulated from online pressure, Amazon.com remains dedicated to cracking the code, finally, on fresh food. "It's an intimidating time for a lot of these retailers," said Jennifer Bartashus, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. "We're poised to see a lot more change in the next couple of years." These are the five forces that are going shake up the landscape of American groceries.  It Looked As Though There Was Safety Selling Food These are tough times for the U.S. retail industry, with stores closing at a record pace so far in 2017. It’s no secret why: Amazon is gobbling up more and more sales of clothing, electronics, and other items that once drew shoppers to department stores and malls. The grocery business has been a safe haven in recent years. Only about 1 percent of the roughly $1.5 trillion industry has moved online. That’s made supermarkets an attractive real estate tenant in an era when other shopping has moved from the mall to the living room couch. The reliability of food sales has also drawn more and more stores into the market for prepared food, snacks, and other traditional grocery items as a reliable driver of store traffic. After all, we have to eat and get more garbage bags. “It’s perceived as relatively impervious to the shift online,” James Cook, director of retail research at JLL, said of the grocery business. "For most of America, food is not purchased online.” Now Groceries Are Everywhere More food is sold in more places these days, with pharmacies and dollar stores looking to groceries to lure customers. Dollar General alone added more than 900 stores last year, ending 2016 with more than 13,000 locations. The chain, which generates roughly 75 percent of revenue from consumable items such as food, soap, and paper towels, is planning to open another 1,000 stores this year. CVS, which operates nearly 8,000 standalone locations, is betting on food to boost store traffic. Like other pharmacies, where shoppers would traditionally visit to pick up deodorant along with a prescription, the chain has boosted its food offerings to add more healthy snacks and grab-and-go options. Grocery Prices Are Falling Fast All this competition has come amid an historic bout of food deflation. Grocers have engaged in a price war that has been a boon for consumers while weighing down on corporate earnings—and those trends will only get more intense once Lidl opens its doors in the U.S. The company has long battled rival German grocer Aldi in markets across Europe. Both companies have taken on entrenched grocers and eaten into market share with their low prices and no-frills stores. Aldi, which has more than 1,600 U.S. stores, has spent the past couple years preparing for Lidl's arrival by aggressively expanding in Southern California and spending $1.6 billion to spruce up its locations. That has put pressure on Wal-Mart and the dollar stores in the competition for budget-conscious shoppers. Wal-Mart Stores, which generates more than half of its revenue from groceries, has been working to improve its fresh food offerings. The retail giant's low grocery prices have made things tough for Kroger Co., the largest supermarket chain in the U.S. Lidl is slated to open 20 locations in Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina this summer and could reach 630 locations over the next six years, according to Kantar Retail. The company had sales of roughly $69 billion last year. Expect Lidl's entrance into the U.S. to ramp up the price war and possibly force smaller, regional companies to close or consolidate. "It's definitely making the regional players nervous," said Bartashus. "It's like a stack of dominoes; it takes one thing to tip it, and they all start moving in one direction."  Food Shopping Isn't a Weekly Behavior Any More The number of shopping trips Americans made to buy food rose rose 1 percent last year, according to Nielsen data. That may not sound like much, but it's the first annual gain in at least a decade. The shift in shopping behavior is being driven, in part, by the increasing preference for fresh food. Americans are shopping more often and buying fewer items per trip. The weekly trip to load up the station wagon is also being supplemented by everything from meal-kit services, such as Blue Apron, grocery deliveries, and visits to the local farmer’s market. The grocery business is known for its razor-thin margins and survival driven by repeat business. The fracturing of this pattern is a long-term risk for grocers, who have responded by boosting prepared food offerings. Amazon Is Hungry for Groceries So far, at least, e-commerce has struggled to encroach on the grocery business. Amazon has tried for nearly a decade to find its way into delivering fresh food without much success. Now the online retail giant is opening brick-and-mortar stores, experimenting with drive-in grocery kiosks where consumers can pick up orders, and working on a hybrid supermarket that mixes the best of online and in-store shopping. Even though customers have been slow to adopt delivery for groceries, the business is expanding. There was a time when analysts felt consumers would never buy shoes online because they wanted to try them on. That sentiment is still applied to grocers—most people, the thinking goes, still want to touch the avocados or talk to a butcher. The looming threat of Amazon's encroachment is another potential headwind for the grocery business.  © Copyright 2017 Bloomberg News. All rights reserved.

The trade deficit has been a source of torment for decades. Critics blame it for job losses. Apologists say it permits Americans to consume more and cheaper products without much harm. Both arguments have an element of truth — but most importantly, the trade deficit must be financed. Foreign governments and private individuals buy U.S. Treasuries, corporate stocks and bonds and real estate in tony locations like Manhattan and Miami Beach, and every year they must pay increasing interest, dividends and rent on those assets. Americans make similar investments abroad, but overall, foreigners are buying more here. The U.S. Net International Investment Position (NIIP) is now minus 45 percent of GDP, and if large trade deficits persist, it could reach negative 60 percent over the next decade — likely sooner. In recent years[SB2] , no nation has reached that level of indebtedness without eventually going through a reversal of its trade deficit, often accompanied by a financial crisis or severe domestic deflation. Economists are inclined to believe bilateral deficits — or even deficits in particular commodities like oil — don’t matter. But if one country or commodity is huge in the numbers, then the global problem can’t be addressed without addressing the particular country or commodity. China accounts for more than 60 percent of the U.S. trade deficit, and petroleum accounts for more than a quarter of the rest. The Trump administration proposes to fix this by pressuring China to open its markets — if Americans can sell more in China, then we can continue to enjoy cheap consumer goods at Wal-Mart — and by liberating the oil and gas sector from Obama-era regulations and continuing to build out wind, solar and other renewable energy sources. As for China, President Trump’s recent statement on trade policy indicates revved-up use of trade remedy laws to keep out or at least penalize subsidized and dumped imports. For U.S. industries that benefit, hooray! But Beijing advantages domestic producers in so many ways — from forced technology transfers from foreign investors to generous benefits for technology startups — that the president’s strategy reminds me of the farmer chasing an infestation of grasshoppers with a butterfly net. The Peterson Institute, in a forthcoming study, suggests a program of currency market intervention to offset foreign government intervention in currency markets and to lower the value of the dollar across the board. These days, manipulation by foreign governments is not the problem. It’s the lack of confidence in the durability of existing regimes. French presidential candidate Marine Le Pen’s challenges to the future of the EU and China’s authoritarian regime are scaring investors and driving down the euro and yuan. At their Mar-a-Lago Summit last month, Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping announced a 100-day review of policies to address the trade deficit, but that is as unlikely to yield results as were similar bilateral talks initiated by Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. Warren Buffet, for many years, has suggested a system of import certificates, and I have advocated a tax on the conversion of currency into yuan. The latter would essentially raise the price of imported goods and encourage reshoring. Under the Buffet Plan, exporters would receive certificates to import goods in amounts equal to their foreign sales, and those, in turn, could be sold to importers who would be required to present certificates to bring goods and services into the country. Those certificates would go to the highest bidders, and hence they’d be used to import goods that had the highest value to consumers. Rather than apply it to all our trading partners, which would cause global outrage, I would apply it only to trade with China — and endure its bellicosity. If Beijing won’t realign its economy to rely less on trade surpluses with the United States, this scheme will do it for them.

China's photovoltaic installation capacity amounted to 43.18 gigawatt by the end of 2015. Image: Shutterstock China.org.cn Friday 5 May 2017 Share this story JinkoSolar, a global leader in the photovoltaic (PV) industry, attended B20 Summit in Berlin on May 2-3 and called for action on the implementation of the Paris Agreement. At the summit, whose theme is “Resilience, Responsibility, Responsiveness - Towards a Future-oriented, Sustainable World Economy,” how to promote sustainable development of economy and implement the Paris Agreement are key issues on the agenda. “The implementation of the agreement depends on business involvement and engagement,” asserted Qian Jing, vice president of JinkoSolar. “It is time for businesses to take action.” She said, “Starting from their own expertise and experience, companies can, for example, steer their capital towards direct investment in clean energy projects and low carbon, energy efficient technology and businesses, purchase and increase use of renewable energy, and become carbon neutral.” She used giants like Apple, Google and Walmart as examples to elaborate her point — These companies have been actively implementing sustainable development strategies and promoting renewable energy projects to fulfill the target of running entirely on renewable energy. Companies also can report emissions and disclose climate change relevant data and information, adapt their business model and supply chain to seize this energy transition opportunity and create new jobs, internally price carbon, comply and align with government climate and energy regulation, support developing low carbon technology and science, and take a responsible approach to lobbying on climate action. Qian believed if enterprises can seize the opportunity brought by energy transformation, a new growth engine will emerge for enterprises. JinkoSolar has been committed to reducing the cost of solar power and helping enterprises shift energy structure and turn more sustainable, and thus implement the Paris Agreement. Carbon trade and carbon pricing are at the exploration stage and need unified standards. China will launch a national carbon emission trade system in 2017, putting itself on a path towards green, low-carbon and climate change-adaptive economy. This year’s B20 Summit has proposed building a platform dedicated to the strategic dialogue for carbon pricing, meaning that solid progress will be made on carbon trade in 2017. Qian said, “We hope G20 governments cooperatively launch a unified carbon market on a broader spectrum, design rules, guidelines, procedures to help parties establish trading schemes, establish a dedicated committee or consultancy group to help countries with carbon market building and pricing setting to address gaps and needs.” Share this story Topics Carbon & Climate Energy Regions China Tags climate international cooperation solar Advertisement Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. blog comments powered by Disqus Advertisement Most popular Energy Renewable energy faces growing human rights concerns Renewable energy faces growing human rights concerns Food & Agriculture Colombian palm oil firm takes RSPO certification to the next level Colombian palm oil firm takes RSPO certification to the next level Energy Cambodia makes first solar power play Cambodia makes first solar power play View all news Industry Spotlight Energy Grid unlocked: Consumers are driving Asia’s energy revolution Grid unlocked: Consumers are driving Asia’s energy revolution Energy Will India’s renewable energy dreams come true?

Joe’s hands get dry in the winter months, and he ends up with cracks on them that can be quite painful. Fig. 1: Heal dry, cracked hands with O’Keeffe’s Working Hands. Joe has tried various solutions but says Working Hands is great. It’s not greasy and not scented, and it actually helps heal up any tiny cuts you might have. Joe discovered the cream at Home Depot; places like Walmart have it now too. It’s about $7 and comes in a plastic screw top can, just like shoe polish. ***   Veteran radio and television engineer John Collinson writes that Tom Osenkowsky was absolutely correct when he wrote here about the importance of capacitance ESR in many circuits. He identifies audio circuits and switching power supplies as two of the paramount situations in which this is crucial. The Sencore LC-53, LC-75, LC-102 and LC-103 are the most valuable tools John knows for thorough analysis on critical electrolytics. The downside? These instruments are almost impossible to buy. Prices from numerous sources are often far higher than when the units were new. To make matters worse, John has an LC-102, which has a problem that drives it far out of calibration — and he can’t find anyone who can fix it. Someone must have ended up with the intellectual property when the company changed hands, so if anyone can point faithful readers of Workbench to a reliable repair facility for the great old Sencore test gear, that would be appreciated. In the meantime, consider some of the newer ESR test devices found on the internet and mentioned in our column. ***   John Collinson offered additional comments that I want to share with you. The first has to do with blinking LEDs. Back in the early 1990s, the radio stations employing John were using Wheatstone A500 consoles. Like everyone in those days, engineers were constantly changing the ubiquitous #387 bulbs used in the on and off buttons. Despite the resistors the manufacturer used to keep the filaments slightly warm, they still burned out. John switched to LED replacements (after cutting out those resistors) and soon experienced a new phenomenon: After a couple months, some of the LEDs started flashing at maybe a 2–3 Hz rate. When one began blinking, it would always do so any time it was on, so it wasn’t intermittent in any way. John checked sockets, supply voltages, contacts — everything was fine. Changing the LED “bulb” corrected it immediately, for a few more months. All channels experienced this problem sooner or later, and no one John talked to could explain the phenomenon. On those LED replacements, you could actually see the tiny LEDs inside the end of the unit. As John recalls, there were two groups of four, and often one group would flash while the other one stayed steady. By the time John left that station, he had collected a copious handful of bad units, and to this day he’s never heard anything in the physics of an LED which would explain this behavior. Then, last year during the NAB Show, John saw an LED replacement lamp in the hallway of a hotel and it appeared to have the exact same type phenomenon. Any thoughts, readers? ***   John also reminds us about the rodent infestation of transmitter site electrical boxes: Don’t forget your outdoor boxes! Critters love pad-mount transformers, which are nice and warm. If you live in fire ant country, you know they seem to have a strong affinity for electrical boxes. Once John found them packed so heavily into the pressure switch on an outdoor well pump that they shut down the pump. And it’s not just ants. Yellow jackets love the shelter of ATUs, which, if running slightly warm, can also attract snakes. It goes without saying that field mice certainly love these places, as well. Sprinkle a few moth balls inside to keep the snakes out, and remember to seal holes and cracks. John warns that like mice, ants will eat right through urethane foam and many types of caulk. Stainless steel wool (which resists rusting) is a better solution. UHF transmitters, in the days before unitized beam supplies, often had individual “pole pig” type electric transformers that were good at converting snakes into grounding sticks. John is living in Florida; he says power company personnel have told him that squirrels are their biggest nemeses. Their ability to chew through insulation and some metals makes them a nonstop headache. ***   We have discussed muffin fans in the column, focusing on uses for these compact cooling devices. Although John Collinson lacks a picture, he’ll paint one with words. John was known for consuming copious quantities of coffee but not having the patience to wait for it to cool down to chugging temperature. One of his engineers took a spare muffin fan and tie-wrapped it to a 7-inch plastic tape reel (for stability), and immediately he had a great little coffee cooler. (Our editor Paul McLane writes: “Where’s a photo when you really want one?”) ***   On that note, here’s another coffee tip. In one of my Workbench SBE presentations a few years back, I showed a coffee warmer designed by West Virginia Radio Corp.’s Randy Kerbawy. Randy took a large metal coffee can and cut a cave-type entry in the side, using a nibbling tool. He made the passageway large enough to fit his Weller soldering iron and stand inside. The coffee cup sat on top of the can, which was warmed throughout the day by the hot soldering iron. ***   We’ve written about Serial-over-IP adaptors in the past, and John Collinson wrapped up his informative note saying he has tried a few. It’s been his experience that these work great in-house, across a LAN, but he has yet to find one that works well across the public internet. John suspects they can’t handle the jitter.

Bloomberg | May 04, 2017 (Bloomberg)—The American grocery store has so far been mostly immune to the ravages of online shopping and the all around apocalyptic outlook facing the nation's retailers. But a war is coming to the staid supermarket, and that could mean more consolidation, bankruptcies, and falling prices. An invasion is getting under way. Lidl, a German retailer known for low prices and efficient operations, is expected to start an aggressive U.S. expansion in the coming weeks that could open as many as 100 new stores across the East Coast by the summer of 2018. The company, which runs about 10,000 stores in Europe, has also set its sights on Texas, one of the most competitive grocery markets in the U.S. Analysts expect Lidl to expand to nearly $9 billion in sales by 2023. The last thing U.S. grocers need is more cutthroat competition. As the ranks of U.S. grocery stores have swelled, food has become a way for struggling brick-and-mortar retailers such as dollar stores and pharmacies to compete for customers. Even though groceries have been somewhat insulated from online pressure, Amazon.com remains dedicated to cracking the code, finally, on fresh food. "It's an intimidating time for a lot of these retailers," said Jennifer Bartashus, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. "We're poised to see a lot more change in the next couple of years." These are the five forces that are going shake up the landscape of American groceries. It Looked As Though There Was Safety Selling Food These are tough times for the U.S. retail industry, with stores closing at a record pace so far in 2017. It’s no secret why: Amazon is gobbling up more and more sales of clothing, electronics, and other items that once drew shoppers to department stores and malls. The grocery business has been a safe haven in recent years. Only about 1 percent of the roughly $1.5 trillion industry has moved online. That’s made supermarkets an attractive real estate tenant in an era when other shopping has moved from the mall to the living room couch. The reliability of food sales has also drawn more and more stores into the market for prepared food, snacks, and other traditional grocery items as a reliable driver of store traffic. After all, we have to eat and get more garbage bags. “It’s perceived as relatively impervious to the shift online,” James Cook, director of retail research at JLL, said of the grocery business. "For most of America, food is not purchased online.” Now Groceries Are Everywhere More food is sold in more places these days, with pharmacies and dollar stores looking to groceries to lure customers. Dollar General alone added more than 900 stores last year, ending 2016 with more than 13,000 locations. The chain, which generates roughly 75 percent of revenue from consumable items such as food, soap, and paper towels, is planning to open another 1,000 stores this year. CVS, which operates nearly 8,000 standalone locations, is betting on food to boost store traffic. Like other pharmacies, where shoppers would traditionally visit to pick up deodorant along with a prescription, the chain has boosted its food offerings to add more healthy snacks and grab-and-go options. Grocery Prices Are Falling Fast All this competition has come amid an historic bout of food deflation. Grocers have engaged in a price war that has been a boon for consumers while weighing down on corporate earnings—and those trends will only get more intense once Lidl opens its doors in the U.S. The company has long battled rival German grocer Aldi in markets across Europe. Both companies have taken on entrenched grocers and eaten into market share with their low prices and no-frills stores. Aldi, which has more than 1,600 U.S. stores, has spent the past couple years preparing for Lidl's arrival by aggressively expanding in Southern California and spending $1.6 billion to spruce up its locations. That has put pressure on Wal-Mart and the dollar stores in the competition for budget-conscious shoppers. Wal-Mart Stores, which generates more than half of its revenue from groceries, has been working to improve its fresh food offerings. The retail giant's low grocery prices have made things tough for Kroger Co., the largest supermarket chain in the U.S. Lidl is slated to open 20 locations in Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina this summer and could reach 630 locations over the next six years, according to Kantar Retail. The company had sales of roughly $69 billion last year. Expect Lidl's entrance into the U.S. to ramp up the price war and possibly force smaller, regional companies to close or consolidate. "It's definitely making the regional players nervous," said Bartashus. "It's like a stack of dominoes; it takes one thing to tip it, and they all start moving in one direction." Food Shopping Isn't a Weekly Behavior Any More The number of shopping trips Americans made to buy food rose rose 1 percent last year, according to Nielsen data. That may not sound like much, but it's the first annual gain in at least a decade. The shift in shopping behavior is being driven, in part, by the increasing preference for fresh food. Americans are shopping more often and buying fewer items per trip. The weekly trip to load up the station wagon is also being supplemented by everything from meal-kit services, such as Blue Apron, grocery deliveries, and visits to the local farmer’s market. The grocery business is known for its razor-thin margins and survival driven by repeat business. The fracturing of this pattern is a long-term risk for grocers, who have responded by boosting prepared food offerings. Amazon Is Hungry for Groceries So far, at least, e-commerce has struggled to encroach on the grocery business. Amazon has tried for nearly a decade to find its way into delivering fresh food without much success. Now the online retail giant is opening brick-and-mortar stores, experimenting with drive-in grocery kiosks where consumers can pick up orders, and working on a hybrid supermarket that mixes the best of online and in-store shopping. Even though customers have been slow to adopt delivery for groceries, the business is expanding. There was a time when analysts felt consumers would never buy shoes online because they wanted to try them on. That sentiment is still applied to grocers—most people, the thinking goes, still want to touch the avocados or talk to a butcher. The looming threat of Amazon's encroachment is another potential headwind for the grocery business.

fusion Deadspin Fusion Gizmodo Jalopnik Jezebel Kotaku Lifehacker The Root Politics Voices Comics Español Immigration Fusion TV Ivanka Trump's Guide to Finding a Work-Life Balance When You Don't Care About Other Women's Work or Lives Katie McDonoughYesterday 11:03am Filed to: Politics Money wages Labor Women Ivanka Trump 74 17 Edit Promote Share to Kinja Toggle Conversation tools Go to permalink Photo Illustration by Elena Scotti/Fusion/GMG, photos via AP, Shutterstock Ivanka Trump would like you to imagine a table. Advertisement Hers is long and “adorned with beautiful bouquets of blush-colored peonies.” Family and friends are seated on both sides, gathered to celebrate some undetermined milestone birthday in her future. Now picture your table. What do you hope to have accomplished? How have you impacted your community? She wonders these things, too. “In reflecting on my marriage and motherhood, my long career as a developer and entrepreneur, what would I say? What would others say about me?” Trump asks in Women Who Work: Rewriting the Rules for Success, a book that grew out of a 2013 marketing exercise devised to help her eponymous lifestyle brand sell block-heel pumps and polyester sheaths to women who read Lean In. Advertisement This question of legacy is written as an aside, but turns out to be something like the existential crux of the book. Women Who Work could have been—probably was originally intended to be—useless if anodyne bit of self-help pap written for rich white women, but in its post-election context, as a policy vision coming from a special assistant to the president of the United States, it feels considerably more alarming. Which returns to the question Trump raises early in the book: How will we remember her? According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the five most common occupations for working women in 2014 were administrative assistant (average salary $37,230), elementary and middle school teacher ($56,720), registered nurse ($68,450), home health aide ($22,600), and retail supervisor ($31,450). Sponsored With the exception of administrative assistant—which Trump conceptualizes as a starter job for an ambitious college graduate who can climb the ranks by demonstrating “sound judgment”—none of these professions exist in the universe of Women Who Work. The women who work in the book seem to do so entirely in offices or startups run out of their living rooms. The women of Women Who Work have vague titles (“productivity expert,” “busy entrepreneur”) and vague concerns about identifying their passions. They want to work smarter, not harder and “let go of balance by seizing meaningful moments.” Advertisement Trump, relying heavily on quotes from social scientists and other similarly situated women in elite businesses, encourages them to spend time building their networks and finding ways to “experiment with different roles and skills” to better understand their strengths. Life is a sampler plate, so why not try it all? For women whose financial obligations do not afford them the freedom to explore and experiment—and with 7 in 10 Americans reporting that they have less than $1,000 in savings, that is likely most women—Trump suggests cultivating curiosity. “I personally love the word ‘curious,’” she writes. She tends to her curiosity by reading and listening to podcasts, “which can trigger lots of interests and ideas.” She enjoys TED Talks as “snackable bits of information.” This could be dismissed as benign schlock if it weren’t coming from a high-level White House official arguing that her work inside the administration will help “unleash the full power of women and girls.” Advertisement Women who work the register at Walmart, change bed clothes for elderly patients, or write on the internet already listen to podcasts on subjects unrelated to their day jobs. Their curiosity doesn’t make them more money—or create more opportunity—when their wages are locked in at the federal minimum and their unions are weakened by right to work laws. The book’s framing of what its advice is supposed to produce for you—and its premise that nearly every woman is just one good idea or introduction away from making a career leap—also takes a more punitive turn on the question of success and failure. Trump, much like her father, seems to think that being born into a very wealthy real estate family only got her part of the way to becoming very wealthy through real estate. The rest, she explains, was grit: My father always said, if you love what you do, and work really, really hard, you will succeed. This is a fundamental principle of creating and perpetuating a culture of success, and also a guiding light for me personally. I also believe that passion, combined with perseverance, is a great equalizer, more important than education or experience in achieving your version of success. I know plenty of brilliant people with immense potential who fell short of expectations (theirs and others!) because their competition was more inspired to succeed. This prosperity gospel bootstrapping bullshit would be risible coming from any wealthy scion positioning herself as an envoy for women’s economic lives. Coming from the daughter of a dunce who managed to “succeed” despite his many well-documented financial and moral fuck-ups, and who conceives of fatherhood mainly as a means of transferring privilege, it is repugnant. Advertisement Advertisement When Women Who Work moves from airy advice about self-help and journaling to more practical chapters about flexible scheduling and returning to work after having children, it reads oddly like warmed-over Hillary Clinton speeches. Though while Clinton, like Trump, has a tendency to talk about women’s work lives—and frame policies—through the narrow lens of upper-middle-class women’s interests, their struggles around work-life balance, she did include labor supports (however inadequate) for domestic workers as part of her economic agenda. Even though Clinton refused to commit to a $15 minimum wage, she did propose to move it to $12 as part of an agenda to improve the lives of working women. The mere existence of low-wage work is acknowledged once in Women Who Work, with the bland assessment that “we need to recognize these important realities and create policies that champion families, enabling the American family to thrive.” The single mention of a nanny comes mid-way through, in a brief aside about the wonderful photos the author’s nanny takes of Trump’s children. Even then, her labor is presented as ephemeral, easily erased. “I’m sure in ten years I’ll convince myself I took them!” Trump writes. It is not exactly surprising that the ideas and advice in a book written by a woman born into wealth and presented a business empire as her destiny don’t apply to the lives led by a majority of working women in this country. No one expected Ivanka Trump to channel Barbara Ehrenreich. What is a bit more surprising, though, is that Women Who Work also feels inapplicable to women negotiating their place in rarified fields like real estate or Silicon Valley. The book manages to fail both as a reflection of women’s work in real terms—a better title might have been Women Who Aspire To Be Niche Entrepreneurs—and as a manual of advice for elite women who more closely resemble Trump herself. She couldn’t even manage to copy Sheryl Sandberg right.  Advertisement Trump seems enamored with Silicon Valley and gig economy startups, but has nothing to say about sexism and the kinds of gender discrimination experienced by women at Uber or Kleiner Perkins. The words “sexism” and “discrimination” do not even appear in the book. Neither does “lawsuit.” The book describes cultural and “narrative” problems that limit women’s opportunities in the workplace, but never addresses the reality of active discrimination—the kind rectified by legal action. (Like the 20 suits brought against Trump’s father and his companies, as an example.) If you refuse to see what the bulk of the female workforce actually looks like—or the material issues they face—then you certainly can’t answer to its problems. Everything old is new again. Women Who Work has very little to say about women’s labor, but quite a lot about Ivanka Trump.

This, presumably, is what she would like to be remembered for at that table she’s visualizing. But the most prominent public role she’s played to date has been as surrogate for a presidential campaign, and now presidency, defined by its racism, misogyny, and a deeply regressive vision for America. In its first 100 days, the Trump administration has rolled back workplace protections for women, overseen hundreds of detentions and deportations that have torn mothers from their children, appointed a woman who denies the science of birth control to oversee federal family planning programs, signed an executive order allowing states to withhold funding from one of the largest reproductive health care providers in the country, and proposed shuttering or scaling back domestic and international programs focused on violence prevention and educational opportunities for women and girls.

A new investigation by the Washington Post may have you questioning the value of some organic milk brands, and what the “organic” label actually means—because some big dairy farmers might not be living up to their end of the bargain. Tests conducted on the behalf of the Post indicate that the acid levels of many organic milk producers—including brands like Horizon and Organic Valley—are significantly different than non-organic counterparts. To be certified organic, milk must come from cows that graze instead of being stuck in cramped shelters feeding on corn. If cows are grass-fed, their milk should contain elevated levels of certain acids (conjugated linoleic acid, alpha-linoleic acid), and lower levels of another acid (linoleic acid) compared to conventional milk. brightcove-video:5360903104001 The one anomaly in the tests was Colorado’s Aurora Organic Dairy, which produces milk sold under many retailer labels, including the Great Value organic brand at Walmart. Its acid levels were much more similar to conventional milks than other major organic milk brands. Post reporters also wrote that “signs of grazing were sparse, at best” for the farm’s 15,000+ cows during their visits to Aurora last year, and that “at no point was any more than 10 percent of the herd out” feeding on grasses. Shoppers pay a premium for USDA-certified organic milk—the average gallon costs $6.49 in the supermarket, compared to $3.30 for a gallon of regular, non-organic milk. Many health experts say organic milk is well worth the extra money because it contains no growth hormones and no antibiotics, and because the production process is more sustainable and humane than some other dairy farming practices. Aurora dismissed the test results as “isolated,” and described the Post’s observations about cow grazing as mere “drive-bys.” An Aurora spokesperson told the Post via email that it complies with all grazing requirements, and affirmed, “We are a 100% certified organic producer.” One reason for skepticism is that, as the Post investigation notes the USDA, which certifies dairy livestock as “organic,” does not actually inspect farms: Instead, farmers hire their own inspectors from lists of private companies and other organizations licensed by the USDA. An inspector makes an annual visit, arranged days or weeks in advance. Only 5 percent of inspections are expected to be done unannounced. The Cornucopia Institute, a nonprofit representing small organic farmers, argues that the USDA’s certification system doesn’t work for consumers (who pay a premium for milk that might not live up to organic principles) or for dairy farmers who truly play by the rules. An Organic Dairy Report published by Cornucopia last summer gave Aurora a “Cow Rating ” of 0, a score that categorizes its production practices as “ethically deficient.” (For that matter, Horizon also received a score of 0 in the report.) “About half of the organic milk sold in the U.S. is coming from very large factory farms that have no intention of living up to organic principles,” the Cornucopia Institute’s Mark Kastel told the Post. This is hardly the first time that Aurora and other large organic milk producers have come under criticism. The New York Times reported back in 2006, when Walmart was dramatically increasing its organic milk offerings, that critics complained Aurora’s cows weren’t spending much time grazing and eating natural grasses. The Cornucopia Institute’s Kastel weighed in back then as well. He said of farms like Aurora: “They are trying to cut corners in the interest of producing milk as cheaply as possible.” More questions are being asked as organic milk consumption rises. Last year, 5.2% of milk sales were organic, compared to only 1.9% a decade ago, Bloomberg reported recently. This story originally appeared on Money.com.

But a war is coming to the staid supermarket, and that could mean more consolidation, bankruptcies, and falling prices. An invasion is getting under way. Lidl, a German retailer known for low prices and efficient operations, is expected to start an aggressive U.S. expansion in the coming weeks that could open as many as 100 new stores across the East Coast by the summer of 2018. The company, which runs about 10,000 stores in Europe, has also set its sights on Texas, one of the most competitive grocery markets in the U.S. Analysts expect Lidl to expand to nearly $9 billion in sales by 2023. The last thing U.S. grocers need is more cutthroat competition. As the ranks of U.S. grocery stores have swelled, food has become a way for struggling brick-and-mortar retailers such as dollar stores and pharmacies to compete for customers. Even though groceries have been somewhat insulated from online pressure, Amazon.com remains dedicated to cracking the code, finally, on fresh food. "It's an intimidating time for a lot of these retailers," said Jennifer Bartashus, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. "We're poised to see a lot more change in the next couple of years." These are the five forces that are going shake up the landscape of American groceries.  Story continues below...

It’s no secret why: Amazon is gobbling up more and more sales of clothing, electronics, and other items that once drew shoppers to department stores and malls. The grocery business has been a safe haven in recent years. Only about 1 percent of the roughly $1.5 trillion industry has moved online. That’s made supermarkets an attractive real estate tenant in an era when other shopping has moved from the mall to the living room couch. The reliability of food sales has also drawn more and more stores into the market for prepared food, snacks, and other traditional grocery items as a reliable driver of store traffic. After all, we have to eat and get more garbage bags. “It’s perceived as relatively impervious to the shift online,” James Cook, director of retail research at JLL, said of the grocery business. "For most of America, food is not purchased online.” Translator To read this article in one of Houston's most-spoken languages, click on the button below.

Dollar General alone added more than 900 stores last year, ending 2016 with more than 13,000 locations. The chain, which generates roughly 75 percent of revenue from consumable items such as food, soap, and paper towels, is planning to open another 1,000 stores this year. CVS, which operates nearly 8,000 standalone locations, is betting on food to boost store traffic. Like other pharmacies, where shoppers would traditionally visit to pick up deodorant along with a prescription, the chain has boosted its food offerings to add more healthy snacks and grab-and-go options. Grocery Prices Are Falling Fast All this competition has come amid an historic bout of food deflation. Grocers have engaged in a price war that has been a boon for consumers while weighing down on corporate earnings—and those trends will only get more intense once Lidl opens its doors in the U.S. The company has long battled rival German grocer Aldi in markets across Europe. Both companies have taken on entrenched grocers and eaten into market share with their low prices and no-frills stores. Aldi, which has more than 1,600 U.S. stores, has spent the past couple years preparing for Lidl's arrival by aggressively expanding in Southern California and spending $1.6 billion to spruce up its locations. That has put pressure on Wal-Mart and the dollar stores in the competition for budget-conscious shoppers. Wal-Mart Stores, which generates more than half of its revenue from groceries, has been working to improve its fresh food offerings. The retail giant's low grocery prices have made things tough for Kroger Co., the largest supermarket chain in the U.S. Lidl is slated to open 20 locations in Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina this summer and could reach 630 locations over the next six years, according to Kantar Retail. The company had sales of roughly $69 billion last year. Expect Lidl's entrance into the U.S. to ramp up the price war and possibly force smaller, regional companies to close or consolidate. "It's definitely making the regional players nervous," said Bartashus. "It's like a stack of dominoes; it takes one thing to tip it, and they all start moving in one direction."  Food Shopping Isn't a Weekly Behavior Any More The number of shopping trips Americans made to buy food rose rose 1 percent last year, according to Nielsen data. That may not sound like much, but it's the first annual gain in at least a decade. The shift in shopping behavior is being driven, in part, by the increasing preference for fresh food. Americans are shopping more often and buying fewer items per trip. The weekly trip to load up the station wagon is also being supplemented by everything from meal-kit services, such as Blue Apron, grocery deliveries, and visits to the local farmer’s market. The grocery business is known for its razor-thin margins and survival driven by repeat business. The fracturing of this pattern is a long-term risk for grocers, who have responded by boosting prepared food offerings. Amazon Is Hungry for Groceries So far, at least, e-commerce has struggled to encroach on the grocery business. Amazon has tried for nearly a decade to find its way into delivering fresh food without much success. Now the online retail giant is opening brick-and-mortar stores, experimenting with drive-in grocery kiosks where consumers can pick up orders, and working on a hybrid supermarket that mixes the best of online and in-store shopping. Even though customers have been slow to adopt delivery for groceries, the business is expanding. There was a time when analysts felt consumers would never buy shoes online because they wanted to try them on. That sentiment is still applied to grocers—most people, the thinking goes, still want to touch the avocados or talk to a butcher. The looming threat of Amazon's encroachment is another potential headwind for the grocery business.  ©2017 Bloomberg L.P.

This story appears in the {{article.article.magazine.pretty_date}} issue of {{article.article.magazine.pubName}}. Subscribe At the end of March, influential employers –  including T-Mobile, Gap Inc., and McDonalds* – came to New Orleans for an unprecedented gathering on jobs in the United States. Each had expressed enthusiasm for impact hiring – an approach that creates business value through recruiting and investing in individuals who face barriers to economic opportunity. Through a cohort-based program designed and led by FSG, and supported by The Rockefeller Foundation and Walmart, employers began putting this enthusiasm into action in new ways. The inaugural impact hiring cohort brings together HR, Operations, and CSR leaders from diverse employers to design new ways for their companies to attract and support entry-level talent, including Opportunity Youth – 16- to 24-year-olds who are neither working nor in school. Over the course of nine months, participants will collaborate in design thinking workshops, engage with youth and community leaders, and develop and evaluate pilot projects at their companies to provide greater opportunity and improve retention for this target audience. Amidst the sights, sounds, and culture of New Orleans, employers began their journey and started to create their own "jazz" around social change and business value. This cohort-based approach, designed to accelerate adoption of impact hiring practices, is an important catalyst to create more inclusive economies by engaging employers in developing new ideas and solutions. FSG has also pulled together a bench of consultants to assist participants with the design and implementation of successful pilot projects. This bench includes representatives from Grads of Life, who will help participating companies develop an impact hiring strategy to meet their business needs and facilitate effective partnerships with workforce training providers to provide a source of job-ready talent. Other bench members will help participants with everything from effective human resources strategies, to research techniques to inform their pilot projects, to communications to build support among key stakeholders. Over the past decade, The Rockefeller Foundation has worked with the private sector to unlock the solutions to some of society's biggest problems – particularly relating to livelihoods – in the United States and around the world. FSG has seen the importance of finding business opportunities that help solve social problems through both our stewardship of the Shared Value Initiative and our consulting work. Supporting a cohort of pioneering companies focused on impact hiring, in partnership with other funders and experts, is an investment both of our organizations believe in. In working together, we have learned three key lessons about employer engagement that we are applying to this cohort learning model: Create A Strong Business Case While many employers want to "do well by doing good," far fewer are able to demonstrate the concrete business value of their investment in society. To help build the business case for impact hiring, FSG's consulting team deeply researched impact hiring best practices. They shared their learnings in a recent report: "Investing in Entry-Level Talent:  Retention Strategies that Work." It includes dozens of examples of impact hiring initiatives with a clear business case, which were used by the companies in New Orleans as they considered how they might demonstrate the ROI of their impact hiring investments. We believe these investments in research and data are critical, because even the most socially-minded employers have shareholders looking at their bottom line. Facilitate Peer-to-Peer Learning The experience in New Orleans was impactful for business leaders because it allowed them to build relationships with their peers in other companies. We hope that strengthening this ecosystem of champions will build the courage to not only experiment but share their best practices more widely with the business and social sectors. It is much easier to lead in this way when you have a community of peers who understand your challenges and are standing with you, and we saw that start to happen in New Orleans. On the first evening of the gathering, one participant exclaimed that even if he didn't get anything else out of the three days, the networking and ideas he received in the first few hours were well worth the trip. Equip The Right Champions In our experience, empowering and equipping multiple internal champions with tools, resources, and interpersonal support is a key part of sustaining change. Many of the businesses we seek to engage are large enough that they operate as complex systems. Change can be challenging for those working within that system, even with authority. Equipping the right champions, or "intrapreneurs," within pioneering businesses is a critical part of this work. These champions don't always need to be in the C-suite, but they must have significant influence and decision-making authority. Often, those who have lived experience overcoming their own barriers have been able to steer their companies to be more inclusive – but they need more allies and partners in this work. Megan Hansen, Vice President of People at MOD Pizza shared, "By participating in this effort we've learned that we all have similar aspirations –  and face similar challenges –  when it comes to creating meaningful work for populations that have traditionally struggled." She explained that this was a turning point for her own work. "This is an inspiring cohort, and by coming together I think we're empowering one another to work collectively in order to create lasting and positive change at our companies and beyond." We look forward to working together to equip more champions and pioneering companies across the private sector by widely sharing the lessons and stories of the companies in the first cohort and by involving a second cohort of companies in a similar setting starting October, 2017 so that our collective work can create the most meaningful and replicable impacts. For more information about this initiative please contact ImpactHiring@fsg.org. * Participating employers include T-Mobile, McDonald's, Walmart, ESL Credit Union, Nordstrom, HMS Host, and Mod Pizza, with Gap Inc. and Chipotle participating as advisors. Nicole Trimble is the Executive Director of the Impact Hiring Initiative at FSG, a nonprofit, mission driven consulting firm.

The fatal shooting of Jalen Johnson happened April 23 after a confrontation in a Walmart parking lot in Clarksville. A grand jury that met this week returned multiple indictments against the bounty hunters, including first-degree felony murder. Each is being held on $300,000 bail. The bounty hunters thought that William Ellis, who has warrants on file, was one of four men in a car with Johnson, police said. But Ellis was not in the car, and none of the men in the vehicle had warrants on file. The seven bounty hunters approached the Nissan at Walmart, then chased it a short distance before two of the men in the car were shot, Johnson fatally. Most of the seven men chasing the car were bounty hunters, and some were bail bondsmen. Generally, bondsmen arrange bond to get detainees out of jail, while bounty hunters are paid to track down and detain people who fail to meet the bond agreement.

Broward Sheriff’s Office Broward County May 04, 2017 9:49 AM After wine theft, a knife escalates legal problems for a Broward woman By David J. Neal dneal@miamiherald.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story An Oakland Park woman accused of stealing wine could face a felony punishment. The Broward Sheriff’s Office says someone seeing Weston’s Country Isles Plaza Publix surveillance video released Mar. 22 recognized Shellee Ross as the woman packing two Veuve Cliquot and six pinot grigio bottles into a tote bag and toting them out on Jan. 26. Court records recognize Ross’ name as being on probation for petit theft after being accused of stealing $411.20 worth of cookware from Walmart. When BSO showed up at Ross’ home to make the arrest in a $243.92 Weston Publix theft, the 31-year-old was cooperative. Before she put her hands behind her back, the affidavit says, Ross pulled a nine-inch knife with a 4 3/4-inch serrated blade out of her waistband and tossed it on the floor. The affidavit says the probation officer on the scene quickly said the concealed weapon was a violation of felony probation. Ross faces one count of petit theft, one count of carrying a concealed weapon and one count of violation of probation/community control. This isn’t Ross’ first probation. She had been on probation in 2014 and 2015 after wayward driving led to a traffic stop. Despite cops said she gave them a false name and attempted to gulp the illegal narcotics with her, police discovered Ross didn’t have a driver’s license and had hydromorphone. David J.

Unacast’s Proximity.Directory: Walmart, The Kroger Company, & Home Depot Among Top U.S. Retailers Dispel Industry Tech Perceptions 75% of the top 20 retailers in the U.S. have implemented proximity technologies into their marketing mix Dell, Unilever, Coca-Cola & Lord & Taylor Share Proximity Technology Adoption Use Cases Retailers struggling due to changing demand and increased use of e-commerce can increase operating profit by almost 9% with a ROI of 175% by using beacon technology. More sensors deployed and a continuous focus amongst the industry players on retargeting, attribution and monetization of location and proximity data 7% increase in PSPs implementing Google’s Eddystone while adoption of Apple’s iBeacon has declined by 3% iBeacon and Eddystone touted as a major factor behind the growth of the proximity industry May 04, 2017 09:04 AM Eastern Daylight Time NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Proximity.Directory, the world’s largest directory of proximity companies, has released its Q1 2017 Report which has aggregated information from more than 388 Proximity Solution Providers in over 52 different countries and reveals the latest trends, facts and figures from the global proximity industry and its increased adoption by the retail industry. This is the 8th edition of the Proximity.Directory Report and the second time the report has dove into the retail vertical. Previously, Proximity.Directory’s Q1 of 2016 report explored the use of proximity data in retail. The following is a year over year data comparison highlighting key changes in the industry: 1.     75% of U.S. retailers have implemented proximity technologies into their marketing mix, including Walmart, The Kroger Company, Home Depot, Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc, Target, CVS Caremark, Lowe’s, Best Buy, Safeway, Sears Holdings, TJX, Macy’s, Rite Aid, Apple Retail, and Dollar General. 2. Since Q1 2016 there has been a 7% increase in PSPs implementing Google’s Eddystone while adoption on Apple’s iBeacon has declined by 3%. 3. Sensors deployed globally have dramatically increased. 134% growth in sensors deployed in 2016. 4. 14,486,000 sensors registered as of Q1 2017, an increase of 11% from Q4 2016. 5. Proximity products and services: Data monetization grew by 13%, Online retargeting by 10% and Proximity Advertising networks by 9%, highlighting the importance of utilizing the proximity data. 6. Technology and software: Wi-Fi is becoming more popular compared to other technologies and software. Wi-Fi adoption has grown by 7% the last year. “E-commerce is growing exponentially. Amazon is eating retailer’s lunch as they have a tremendous amount of data on their customers,” said Thomas Walle, CEO and co-founder of Unacast. “Consumers still enjoy traditional shopping as more than 90% of sales come from ‘brick and mortar.’ Retailers need to bridge offline and online, know their customers better and be able to fully personalize the shopping experience, similar to what they experience online.” Key Findings: More companies adopting to the Eddystone protocol as 56% of the industry supports it as of Q1 2017 compared to iBeacon’s 87%. Going into 2017 we see an increase in all proximity based products and services, as well as proximity advertising networks, data monetization, and online retargeting are gaining traction amongst PSPs. Beacons are still the most popular proximity technology in the industry, with 91% followed by GPS/Geofence at 58% and Wi-Fi at 35%. Retail & Shopping malls are still the most popular industry vertical utilizing proximity data while 50% of the PSPs are operating in 10 or more verticals. Operating profits for medium-sized retail chains is expected to grow to 12% with a ROI of 365%. ROI in beacon technology can be as high as 2,776% for retail giants that already have mobile applications. Retailers that struggle due to changing demand and increased use of e-commerce (e.g. book retail) can still improve their position and increase operating profit by almost 9% with a ROI of 175%. Europe still has the most PSPs registered with the Directory (43%) compared to North America’s 40%, while the United States represents 35% of the total number of PSPs. As many as 62% of the PSPs in the directory started up in 2013 and later, as a result of the release of iBeacon and Eddystone. Real cases submitted by Proximity.Directory partners repeatedly prove an average conversion rate of 15%, which increases revenues by approximately 10%. Case Study Summaries: Multikino Multiplex Cinemas and Coca-Cola engaged millennials using mobile advertising coupon campaigns in the cinema by using geofencing through Proxi.cloud in Poland. In order to get a coupon, users had to be in a specific location and “shake” their smartphone to receive special coupons. Results: 260 000 shakes made by 80,500 unique users during a two month campaign, 5% offline conversion rate (resulted in coupon redemption in the Cinema). Dell used ShopAdvisor to build awareness and consideration around the Alienware and Pandora product lines and drive foot traffic to selected brick & mortar locations throughout several regions in the U.S. Results: Over the course of the six-week campaign, there were 9.4 million shopper impressions between 183 retail locations, which included 1.5 million value-add impressions. Drove 20,276 incremental visits to retailers, a 42.1% lift compared to the people who did not see the ads. Lord & Taylor used entrance beacons that broadcasted BLE signals into nearby common areas of U.S. malls. Visitors who walked by these areas received relevant, time-sensitive marketing messages that encouraged them to stop by the store during their mall visit. Additional in-store beacons were used to measure the number of messages mall visitors who came into the store. Results: Through a series of campaign iterations and an ongoing optimization process, Lord & Taylor was able to positively impact store visit rates. The company has also generated meaningful insight into the content, design, and messaging approaches that drive the highest mobile engagement rates for in-store shoppers. To drive footfall and generate awareness of the recently opened ice-cream pop-up stores by targeting users based on location, Unilever’s Magnum used beacons and geofencing from Tamoco to provide effective measurement of how many users went on to visit the store; to prove the benefits of receiving location insights in real time in order to inform future campaigns for Magnum. Results: A daily average of 3,091 and a total of over 85,000 push notifications were sent to users as they entered a particular geofence. Of these notifications, 3,279 opened the notification and 1,785 users visited the store after receiving the notification, which was validated by using in-store beacons—a 54% conversion rate. Unacast will be hosting a webinar to discuss Proximity.Directory report findings on Wednesday, May 31 at 1:30pm ET.

May the Fourth, as in “May the Fourth Be With You” has become a day to celebrate all things Star Wars. Retailers like Target, Amazon, and Walmart are all celebrating as well, with Star Wars promotions and deals. Star Wars’ official website says “May the Fourth” references can be traced to 1979, but the day took off once the Internet started connecting fans. According to Mashable here are a few facts about Star Wars: Chewbacca’s voice is a mix of different animals including a bear, badger, lion and walrus. Jabba the Hut was not originally meant to be a slimy slug, but a was supposed to be a fuzzy creature. Other than Harrison Ford, Burt Reynolds along with Al Pacino, Jack Nicholson and Christopher Walken were some of the top contenders to portray Han Solo.

Home | Peter Morici Tags: Fix | Trade | Deficit | Risk | Financial | Crisis Fix Trade Deficit or Risk Another Financial Crisis (Olivier-Le-Queinec/Dreamstime) By Peter Morici Twitter @pmorici1 Thursday, 04 May 2017 09:00 AM Current | Bio | Archive Close  More ways to share... Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    The Commerce Department reported the deficit on international trade goods and services in March was about $43.7 billion, indicating the United States is on track to another trade gap in excess of $500 billion for 2017. For decades, the trade deficit has been a source of torment. Critics blame it for jobs losses, and apologists say it permits Americans to consume more and cheaper products without much harm. Both arguments have an element of truth but most importantly, the trade deficit must be financed. Foreign governments and private persons buy U.S. Treasuries, corporate stocks and bonds and real estate in tony locations like Manhattan and Miami Beach, and we have to pay interest, dividends and rent on those assets that grow larger each year. Americans make similar investments abroad, but overall foreigners are buying more here. The U.S. Net International Investment Position (NIIP) is now minus 45 percent of GDP and if large trade deficits persist, the NIIP could reach negative 60 percent over the next decade—likely sooner. In recent years, no nation has reached that level of indebtedness without eventually going through a reversal of its trade deficit, often accompanied by a financial crisis or severe domestic deflation. Economists are inclined to believe bilateral deficits—or even deficits in particular commodities like oil—don’t matter but if one country or commodity is huge in the numbers then the global problem can’t be addressed without addressing the particular country or commodity. China accounts for more than 60 percent of the U.S. trade deficit and petroleum for more than a quarter of the rest. Trump administration proposes to fix the China trade by applying pressure to open its markets—if Americans can sell more in China, then we can continue to enjoy cheap consumer goods at Wal-Mart. And by liberating the oil and gas sector from Obama era regulations and continuing to build out wind, solar and other renewable energy sources. As for China, the president’s recent statement on trade policy indicates revved up use of trade remedy laws to keep out or at least penalize subsidized and dumped imports. For U.S. industries that benefit hooray, but Beijing advantages domestic producers in so many ways—from forced technology transfers from foreign investors to generous benefits for technology startups—that Mr. Trump’s strategy reminds me of the farmer chasing an infestation of grasshoppers with a butterfly net. The Peterson Institute suggests in a forthcoming study a program of currency market intervention to offset foreign government intervention in currency markets and lower the value of the dollar across the board. These days, manipulation by foreign governments is not the problem—but rather the lack of confidence in the durability of existing regimes. Marine Le Pen challenging the future of the EU and China’s authoritarian regime are scaring investors and driving down the euro and yuan. At the Mar-a-Lago Summit, Presidents Trump and Xi announced a 100-day review of policies to address the trade deficit but that is as unlikely to yield results as were similar bilateral talks initiated by Presidents Bush or Obama. Warren Buffett, for many years, has suggested a system of import certificates and elsewhere, I have advocated a tax on the conversion of currency into yuan. The latter would essentially raise the price of imported goods and encourage reshoring. Under the Buffett Plan, exporters would receive certificates to import goods in amounts equal to their foreign sales and in turn, those could be sold to importers, who would be required to present certificates to bring goods and services into the country. Those certificates would go to the highest bidders and hence be used to import goods that had the highest value to consumers. Rather than apply it to all our trading partners—and cause global outrage—I would just apply it to trade with China and endure its bellicosity as needed. Either Beijing finally starts realigning its economy to rely less on trade surpluses with the United States or this scheme would do it for them. No matter which tact chosen, Americans would pay more for toasters, T-shirts and TVs. However, that burden would pale by comparison to losses in jobs and living standards imposed by a debt crisis on the scale of that endured by other nations who left their problems to fester until international investors quit buying their bonds and other assets.

It’s too expensive. I don’t have the budget.” Vinas was not the only customer to express a similar point of view. Others said that for their groceries they went several blocks north and west to lower-cost rival Trader Joe’s, where products may not be so exquisitely selected but are, in general, more uniformly discounted. Maria Johnson, a postgraduate student, said Whole Foods’ pricing, with some items marked competitively and other expensive, was inconvenient. “I only buy body lotion and lunch here. And maybe spices,” Johnson said. “There are so many different price points you feel like you are missing out on the more fun, expensive things – and when you are shopping for the cheaper, more affordable things, you’re reminded of the things you can’t afford.” Related: As more buy clothes online, Walmart eyes a piece of the action But the views of Manhattan’s grocery shoppers point to only part of the problem for Whole Foods, sometimes called Whole Paycheck, which has been facing a backlash from consumers. Load Error Founded in Austin, Texas, in 1980, Whole Foods Market, to give it its official name, has about 462 locations and a market value of almost $12bn. The chain helped make health food and organic food mainstream, and in its boom years shook up the food retail industry. Whole Foods had grand plans for a UK expansion too, opening its first outpost in Kensington in 2004 with plans for 40 more. But Whole Foods has stalled: like much of the retail sector, it faces economic headwinds including razor-thin margins, competition from other retailers offering organic food, and increasingly price-conscious consumers. In February, the company announced it would close nine stores: in Chicago, New Mexico, Utah, Arizona, and Georgia, and two each in Colorado and California. The closures, which followed six straight quarters of sales declines, represented the first downsizing since 2008. Founder and chief executive John Mackey explained that the business had changed because “the more conventional, mainstream supermarkets have upped their game. The world is very different today than it was five years ago.” One rival chain, Sprouts Farmers Market, was found to be on average 19% cheaper than Whole Foods. Other rivals, including Kroger, picked up Whole Foods customers. Last month, Barclays advised that Whole Foods had experienced a “staggering” decline in foot traffic that it estimated at 3%, or roughly 14 million customers. Whole Foods has long been the butt of jokes for its prices – although it disputes it is more expensive than it rivals – and its bougie products. Comedian John Oliver is particularly fond of its asparagus water. The difficult transition from expensive behemoth to a more nimble grocery store is reflected in its share price, which has dropped by almost half since October 2013. Investors are increasingly petitioning the company to move faster with reforms. An acquisition would underscore the consolidation of the US food retail industry as the sector prepares to compete against online retailers including Amazon, stores like Walmart and discount chains such as Aldi. Earlier this week, the Financial Times reported that Cerberus Capital Management, the New York private equity firm that owns Albertsons and Safeway, had initiated talks with bankers about making a bid. Other potential suitors include Jana Partners, an activist investor group that has amassed a 9% stake. In a regulatory filing, Jana said it wanted Whole Foods to “improve its technology and operations to better compete with larger rivals, shake up its board, and explore how much potential bidders might be willing to pay”. Jana has proposed nominees to the Whole Foods board, including Glenn Murphy, a former Gap chief executive, and former New York Times food journalist Mark Bittman, who has argued that the chain needs simplifying. Jana is run by 58-year-old yoga and health food devotee Barry Rosenstein. He has said he wants Whole Foods to learn from national chains while staying true to its mission. Whole Foods’ own efforts at reform include the expansion of 365 smaller stores offering lower-priced products. The stores will stock about 7,000 items, far fewer than the 35,000 to 52,000 at a typical Whole Foods location. Outside Trader Joe’s, Brooklyn homemaker Eva Lev said she rarely visits Whole Foods nowadays. “It’s like that Jim Gaffigan joke – Whole Foods on Sunday is just a refugee camp for people with too much money.” Lev added she prefers Trader Joe’s “because it seems like an everyman’s place, and you can still get organic”.

Need to get tested for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)? RELATED: Subscribe to our daily newsletter for the latest in hair, beauty, style and celebrity news. Awkward clinic visits and stressful waits are no more. You can test yourself in the convenience of your own home with the MyLAB Box kit, which is the first of its kind and offers at-home screenings for over a dozen sexually transmitted diseases including Herpes, Syphilis and Chlamydia. This take-home kit, which most recently became available at Target, Walmart and Amazon, was created by co-founders Lora Ivanova and Ursula Hessenflow.  With the CDC reporting that nearly half of Americans will have an STD in their lifetime, and one third of Americans are currently living with an STD, these creators knew that something had to change. Especially considering the fast-paced dating world we live in that's dominated by online dating apps and frequent hook ups. It is essential to have an updated way of ensuring a healthy sex life without a hassle. RELATED: Almost Half Of U.S. Adults Have This STD By taking a new approach to testing for these diseases, this groundbreaking kit aims to "find a way for us to catch up with the rest of our lives and the technology."  The three levels for the boxes include a safe box, uber box and total box. The safe box tests for the four most common STDs, the Uber box screens for seven of the most common STDs and the total package screens for all STD risks. RELATED: New App Delivers STD Results Right to Your Phone "What I'm most passionate about is re-thinking the way that we approach our health care and finding a way to develop a healthier system that evolves as we do and grows as we do," the MyLAB Box founder told ESSENCE.  This is how it works: 1. Order your box online. 2. Test at home by mailing in a urine, swab or tiny blood prick sample. 3. Receive your results within a few days. 4. Free Consultations — in the unfortunate event that you do test positive, a complimentary consultation with an STD professional or a physician visit.

May the Fourth, as in “May the Fourth Be With You” has become a day to celebrate all things Star Wars. Retailers like Target, Amazon, and Walmart are all celebrating as well, with Star Wars promotions and deals. Star Wars’ official website says “May the Fourth” references can be traced to 1979, but the day took off once the Internet started connecting fans. RELATED:  Tokyo jeweler offers gold Darth Vader mask for $1.4 million According to Mashable here are a few facts about Star Wars: Chewbacca’s voice is a mix of different animals including a bear, badger, lion and walrus. Jabba the Hut was not originally meant to be a slimy slug, but a was supposed to be a fuzzy creature. Other than Harrison Ford, Burt Reynolds along with Al Pacino, Jack Nicholson and Christopher Walken were some of the top contenders to portray Han Solo. The language the Ewoks speak is a combination of Tibetan and Nepalese. So May the Fourth be with you today, but remember, tomorrow is the Revenge of the Fifth.

The world's biggest security firm saw revenues grow 8.9pc in the first quarter of this year compared to the same period in 2016. This sent shares up 4pc in early trading. The troubled company has attempted to rebuild its business since 2013, slimming down its debt pile and selling off some divisions, after a series of blunders including failing to provide enough security guards at the London Olympics. G4S's revenues increased G4S said growth came from its developed markets, such as in America where it has recently signed a contract with Walmart to handle its cash. Citi said that this deal had been "distortive" on the numbers, while there was "encouraging growth momentum" in most other regions.  Ashley Almanza, chief executive, said: "In line with our expectations, the group had a strong start to the year, with the momentum from 2016 continuing into the first quarter of 2017." G4S Those new contracts and those in the pipeline mean that the group expects average revenue growth to be between 4pc and 6pc per year, and that its net debt to ebitda ratio would be 2.5x or lower by the end of this year. Last July, the company sold its ATM service business to IBM, and offloaded its Israeli arm for £88m in December. It has indicated it will continue to sell more business over the next two years to claw back some of the losses it has made on contracts that have proved more costly than expected. G4S recently announced a deal with Lloyds to help provide "banks on wheels" to fill the gap created by bank closures. The company already provides armoured vehicles to transport and store cash, and it plans to provide the mobile banks to serve remote areas with no high street branch.  G4S has been reducing the amount of work it does for the UK government, which now stands at 5pc of total revenues. Instead it is focusing on divisions such as its "cash solutions" business, which it believes is poised for growth.

But a war is coming to the staid supermarket, and that could mean more consolidation, bankruptcies, and falling prices. The most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter. Sign Up An invasion is getting under way. Lidl, a German retailer known for low prices and efficient operations, is expected to start an aggressive U.S. expansion in the coming weeks that could open as many as 100 new stores across the East Coast by the summer of 2018. The company, which runs about 10,000 stores in Europe, has also set its sights on Texas, one of the most competitive grocery markets in the U.S. Analysts expect Lidl to expand to nearly $9 billion in sales by 2023. The last thing U.S. grocers need is more cutthroat competition. As the ranks of U.S. grocery stores have swelled, food has become a way for struggling brick-and-mortar retailers such as dollar stores and pharmacies to compete for customers. Even though groceries have been somewhat insulated from online pressure, Amazon.com remains dedicated to cracking the code, finally, on fresh food. "It's an intimidating time for a lot of these retailers," said Jennifer Bartashus, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. "We're poised to see a lot more change in the next couple of years." These are the five forces that are going shake up the landscape of American groceries.  It Looked As Though There Was Safety Selling Food   These are tough times for the U.S. retail industry, with stores closing at a record pace so far in 2017. It’s no secret why: Amazon is gobbling up more and more sales of clothing, electronics, and other items that once drew shoppers to department stores and malls. The grocery business has been a safe haven in recent years. Only about 1 percent of the roughly $1.5 trillion industry has moved online. That’s made supermarkets an attractive real estate tenant in an era when other shopping has moved from the mall to the living room couch. The reliability of food sales has also drawn more and more stores into the market for prepared food, snacks, and other traditional grocery items as a reliable driver of store traffic. After all, we have to eat and get more garbage bags. “It’s perceived as relatively impervious to the shift online,” James Cook, director of retail research at JLL, said of the grocery business. "For most of America, food is not purchased online.” Now Groceries Are Everywhere More food is sold in more places these days, with pharmacies and dollar stores looking to groceries to lure customers. Dollar General alone added more than 900 stores last year, ending 2016 with more than 13,000 locations. The chain, which generates roughly 75 percent of revenue from consumable items such as food, soap, and paper towels, is planning to open another 1,000 stores this year. CVS, which operates nearly 8,000 standalone locations, is betting on food to boost store traffic. Like other pharmacies, where shoppers would traditionally visit to pick up deodorant along with a prescription, the chain has boosted its food offerings to add more healthy snacks and grab-and-go options. Grocery Prices Are Falling Fast All this competition has come amid an historic bout of food deflation. Grocers have engaged in a price war that has been a boon for consumers while weighing down on corporate earnings—and those trends will only get more intense once Lidl opens its doors in the U.S. The company has long battled rival German grocer Aldi in markets across Europe. Both companies have taken on entrenched grocers and eaten into market share with their low prices and no-frills stores. Aldi, which has more than 1,600 U.S. stores, has spent the past couple years preparing for Lidl's arrival by aggressively expanding in Southern California and spending $1.6 billion to spruce up its locations. That has put pressure on Wal-Mart and the dollar stores in the competition for budget-conscious shoppers. Wal-Mart Stores, which generates more than half of its revenue from groceries, has been working to improve its fresh food offerings. The retail giant's low grocery prices have made things tough for Kroger Co., the largest supermarket chain in the U.S. Lidl is slated to open 20 locations in Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina this summer and could reach 630 locations over the next six years, according to Kantar Retail. The company had sales of roughly $69 billion last year. Expect Lidl's entrance into the U.S. to ramp up the price war and possibly force smaller, regional companies to close or consolidate. "It's definitely making the regional players nervous," said Bartashus. "It's like a stack of dominoes; it takes one thing to tip it, and they all start moving in one direction."  Lidl’s planned new locations. Source: Planned Grocery Food Shopping Isn't a Weekly Behavior Any More The number of shopping trips Americans made to buy food rose rose 1 percent last year, according to Nielsen data. That may not sound like much, but it's the first annual gain in at least a decade. The shift in shopping behavior is being driven, in part, by the increasing preference for fresh food. Americans are shopping more often and buying fewer items per trip. The weekly trip to load up the station wagon is also being supplemented by everything from meal-kit services, such as Blue Apron, grocery deliveries, and visits to the local farmer’s market. The grocery business is known for its razor-thin margins and survival driven by repeat business. The fracturing of this pattern is a long-term risk for grocers, who have responded by boosting prepared food offerings. Amazon Is Hungry for Groceries So far, at least, e-commerce has struggled to encroach on the grocery business. Amazon has tried for nearly a decade to find its way into delivering fresh food without much success. Now the online retail giant is opening brick-and-mortar stores, experimenting with drive-in grocery kiosks where consumers can pick up orders, and working on a hybrid supermarket that mixes the best of online and in-store shopping. Even though customers have been slow to adopt delivery for groceries, the business is expanding. There was a time when analysts felt consumers would never buy shoes online because they wanted to try them on. That sentiment is still applied to grocers—most people, the thinking goes, still want to touch the avocados or talk to a butcher. The looming threat of Amazon's encroachment is another potential headwind for the grocery business.  Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

(Clarksville Police Department via AP) The night of April 23, a group of bounty hunters and bail bondsmen in Clarksville, Tenn., tracked a black Nissan sedan to a Walmart parking lot on the edge of town. A wanted man was riding in the car, or so they thought, according to police. So when the timing was right, the seven of them converged on the vehicle and tried to snatch up their suspect. What happened next isn’t quite clear, but a struggle ensued and at least one of the bounty hunters opened fire, police said. The Nissan screeched out of the parking lot, and the bounty hunters gave chase in two cars of their own. Over the next seven miles, they continued to fire at the sedan and at one point rammed it from behind, the Associated Press reported. The pursuit ended when the driver pulled over, injured by the gunfire. A passenger, Jalen Johnson, had been shot as well. Johnson, a 24-year-old father of three, died at a hospital shortly after, according to the Associated Press. Two other passengers made it out unharmed. The bounty hunters had the wrong people. Nobody in the car was suspected of a crime, police said. Nobody had outstanding warrants. Nobody was carrying a weapon. On Wednesday, a grand jury in Montgomery County, Tenn., indicted all seven bounty hunters and bondsmen on counts of first-degree felony murder, attempted second-degree murder, kidnapping and several other charges, local media reported. “After an exhaustive investigation, numerous man hours expended interviewing individuals, processing crime scenes, and sorting through statements and evidence, the information was presented to the grand jury for consideration,” Clarksville Police spokesman Jim Knoll told the Leaf-Chronicle. The grand jury also found that the four men in the Nissan had not committed any crimes. Most of the defendants are bounty hunters and others were bail bondsmen, although police didn’t specify the exact breakdown. They range in age from 27 to 38. All are from Clarksville except for one, who is a resident of Nevada, reported the Leaf-Chronicle. Their bonds were set at $300,000 each, and all were booked in the Montgomery County jail, local media reported. Attorney information for the defendants wasn’t immediately available Wednesday. Emergency dispatchers started receiving calls for a shooting in progress at about 12:30 a.m. the night of the car chase, police said. Around that time, a few of the bondsmen involved called 911 and reported that the men in the Nissan were firing shots, according to the Leaf-Chronicle, which reviewed audio from the calls. After investigating, police said there were no indications that anyone in the car was armed or firing at the group. Bounty hunter told 911 he opened fire because he was shot at first in slaying of Jalen Johnson.https://t.co/cYNKjMiz1X #Clarksville pic.twitter.com/ku4uuPvUW5 — The Leaf-Chronicle (@LeafChronicle) April 27, 2017 Johnson, the passenger who died, had three young children. His uncle, Toni Jenkins, told the Associated Press that Johnson and his friends thought they were being attacked by gang members when the bounty hunters swarmed them in the Walmart parking lot. Another relative, Ronnie Milan, said he wished the judge had ordered the defendants held without bond. “He can’t get out of the casket, so they shouldn’t be able to get out on bond,” he told the Leaf-Chronicle. “He was 24 and healthy as a tree and now he’s dead and gone.” Debra Morehead, the grandmother of the driver who was injured by gunfire, said her grandson was grieving from the ordeal. “This has messed him up,” she told the Leaf-Chronicle. “He’s such a good kid.” national morning-mix Dallas shooting updates News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 follow-dallas false after3th false Please provide a valid email address.

But years of decline have saw the once-thriving area decline, with optimism replaced by despair and heroin.  Less than two million people live in West Virginia. Yet 150 out of every 1,000 babies born in the state are already addicted to opioids.  Charleston, the state capital, which is only 250 miles from Washington DC, has seen its economy slump. Instead of heavy industry, the state's biggest employer is now Wal-Mart.  Scroll down for video  West Virginia has one of the worst heroin epidemics in the United States, with police in Huntington claiming that 90 per cent of their work now relates to dealing with drug-related offences. Last August they dealt with 28 overdoses in one day West Virginia was once central to the nation's coal country, but now those well paying jobs are all gone Many former miners were treated with pain medication to deal with their injuries, but this led some towards heroin It is a place where most of those looking for hope leave in search of opportunity, and where those without hope often turn to drugs.   In Huntington, a city in the state's northwest corner portrayed as the epicenter of the nationwide crisis, 28 people overdosed - two fatally - on a single day last August after injecting heroin laced with fentanyl, a dangerous synthetic opioid.

'Now that I come to think about it, it's ruined my life a lot.' The vast majority of heroin users nationwide resorted to that drug after becoming addicted to powerful pain medications like oxycodone - better known as hillbilly heroin -  according to the US Drug Enforcement Agency. On one day in August, 28 people overdosed on heroin which had been laced with the more powerful synthetic fentanyl  This woman's arms and hands show the scars of repeated injections as she constantly searches for a vein for her next fix Even the police acknowledge that simply arresting the addicts does not work as treatment is needed to counter the epidemic The highly addictive narcotics flooded into West Virginia in mind-boggling numbers for years, and unlike heroin were distributed in the open, with the help of 'pain clinics' that weren't overly strict about writing prescriptions, and pharmacies that made no effort to keep tabs on how many pills went out the door. Among those addicts are many older, retired coal miners, who were injured on the job but continued working with the help of pain medication. When their prescriptions were cut off after authorities finally cracked down on the supply - they turned to heroin, sometimes smoking rather than injecting it. But arresting traffickers and users, suing drug companies and distributors and shutting down pharmacies that pumped out pills, has not been enough to stem the flow of drugs.  According to police, 1kg of fentanyl costs $5,000, but with tablets selling for $20 each on the streets, the entire consignment is worth a staggering $20 million - however, as Fentanyl is far more powerful than heroin it is causing many overdoses With the decline of the coal industry in West Virginia, it has hit the wider economy exacerbating the collapse On August 15, 2016, 28 drug addicts overdosed in Huntington after a batch of the drug was laced with fentanyl  'We can't arrest our way out of this problem' - that is the new mantra of all those involved in the fight. The economic incentives for dealers are powerful: one kilogram of fentanyl, for instance, costs $5,000 and makes a million tablets sold at $20 each for a gain of $20 million. And there are too many facets to the crisis: the overwhelmed jail and foster care systems; the shortage of treatment options and struggles with health insurance coverage; the job prospects of former addicts with a felony on their record. A new DEA pilot program called the 360 Strategy is working with law enforcement and community groups to divert addicts into treatment rather than jail, and educate about the dangers of prescription drugs and heroin. more videos 1 2 3 Watch video Father pulls hysterical 'blinker fluid' prank on his two girls Watch video 'I don't give a f***': Woman strolls through airport NAKED Watch video Gamers in China try to grab live cats out of claw machine Watch video Police officer jumps into a pond to rescue drowning autistic boy Watch video Husky dad looks like he's had tough day parenting his pups Watch video Employee fakes work injury when she hits herself with a sprinkler Watch video Great white shark circles boat off WA coast Watch video Moment San Diego pool shooter pulls gun and opens fire Watch video Dramatic footage shows police shoot dead gunman Peter Selis Watch video Kid loses his mind when a firetruck pulls up outside his house Watch video Heartwarming moment stray dog leads rescuers to her ten puppies Watch video Claw-some! Scaredy cat receives comfort from sister at vet In recent months, the youngest overdose in Huntington is seven while the eldest was 77 West Virginia's heroin epidemic started with the over prescription of main medication such as 'hillbilly heroin'  Despite the stepped-up fight, the numbers state-wide don't look good: deaths are up, it still has the highest overdose rate in the country, and 43 per cent of people imprisoned last year had a substance abuse issue so acute they needed immediate medical attention. One victim of the epidemic was Ryan Brown from Charleston. He returned from his second year at the University of West Virginia addicted to heroin. He was found collapsed in the bathroom having had an overdose.  After undergoing several years of treatment, he eventually succumbed to the drug.   West Virginia has the highest overdose rates in the country, while more than 40 per cent of those imprisoned were so acutely addicted to opioids that they required immediate medical attention to deal with their problem on arrival in jail  Many addicts will travel to Huntington from surrounding areas to pick up their drugs, centralizing the problem  Across the state, there are a number of rehab centers to help addicts such as Rusy Eads, center The addicts in the Recovery Point rehab center in Huntington live in sparsely decorated dormitories  The economic collapse poses an additional problem for recovering addicts as those with felony convictions will find it incredibly difficult to secure a new job to support themselves - leaving them at greater risk of replapse.  The 1kg block of fentany can be cut with enough drugs to supply an estimated 1 million doses worth $20 million Despite the decline, there are some signs of optimism in Huntington with his designer shop But for many, the prospects for the future are less bright, even if their time in rehab is successful  Addicts can face months before making their way into rehab, which, unfortunately is not soon enough for some Officer Dishmann searches a woman he suspects may have been using drugs while on an overnight patrol    Share or comment on this article e-mail 297 shares Most watched News videos Cute orangutan is freed by rescuers after TWO YEARS in a box Shocking video shows family thrown off Delta flight in seat saga Great white shark circles boat off WA coast 'I can't stand up any more': Prince Philip jokes about retirement Caring motorist HUGS driver who nearly knocked him off his bike We sent a model out with a fake cold sore, will she be able to pull?

How big could Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A) get? With $210 billion in revenue, which ranks it number four on the Fortune 500, it would seem that Berkshire might have already grown to the sky, right? Not exactly. In fact, there’s reason to think that Berkshire could become the biggest company in the America, passing Apple (AAPL), Exxon (XOM) and even Walmart (WMT), the three companies ahead of Berkshire on the list. Let’s take a look at the numbers—specifically the 2016 Fortune 500—to help me illustrate: View photos (Source: Fortune.com)More First, it’s interesting that Apple and Berkshire are number three and four. Both have been growing fast but by different means. Apple’s jaw-dropping growth—remember this company was at death’s door 20 years ago—has been done almost 100% through organic sales growth. Again, a stunning, almost unprecedented rise in revenue. Berkshire, while it has garnered a great deal of internal sales growth has benefited mightily from massive acquisitions like Precision Castparts in 2015 (its biggest deal ever), Burlington Northern Sante Fe (2009), and Kraft Heinz (2013). Exxon, in the number two spot, owes its position mostly to its massive core business that it has built over the years, plus being a consolidator in the oil and gas business, i.e. buying Mobil in 1998 and more recently XTO in 2009. Berkshire’s march up the rankings has been impressive. In 1995—the first year Fortune merged its list of biggest service companies with biggest industrial companies to form what you might call the modern Fortune 500 list—Berkshire ranked #295. In 2000 it was #64. It 2005, #12. And of course it’s the only company this big that was built and still run by one guy: Buffett! Both Apple and Exxon seem to be well within reach of Berkshire’s grasp, with “only” $23 billion and $35 billion more in sales respectively than Berkshire. Of course, you have to remember that these companies—especially perhaps Apple—may do a large acquisition at some point. You hear for instance that Apple with its $200 billion cash trove “should” or “will” buy Disney, #53 on the Fortune 500. That would immediately add $52 billion in revenues to Apple moving that company in the #2 spot. And so what about Walmart? With $482 billion in sales—or $272 billion more than Berkshire—it would seem to be out of reach for Berkshire. Berkshire would have to more than double to pass the retailing giant. View photos Warren Buffett at the Fortune’s Most Powerful Women’s Summit in Washington, DC, U.S. on October 13, 2015. REUTERS/Kevin LamarqueMore Could Berkshire ever eclipse Walmart? Maybe, maybe not. One thing in Berkshire’s favor is that it’s growing much faster than Walmart organically. But of course if Berkshire were ever to pass Walmart it would need to do a number of major deals. And of course that’s exactly what Buffett has been doing recently. So exactly how could Buffett get say $300 billion in revenue? Even buying Exxon $246 billion (not likely), Apple $233 billion (maybe) wouldn’t do the trick. But how about buying some combination of CVS $153 billion, GE $140 billion, Costco $116 billion, or Microsoft $93 billion? It’s fun to speculate, right? What Buffett said And what does Buffett himself actually think about these rankings? He couldn’t possibly care, right? Don’t be so sure. Read More I recently asked Buffett: “Do you ever have your eye on making Berkshire the number one company in the Fortune 500?” And he said: “I think over time, if we can find ways to reinvest all the earnings it should become that because we’re reinvesting all the capital. Now, whether we can do that intelligently at scale, for how long is an open question. I mean, the money belongs to the shareholders, and we should only keep it if we think we’re turning a dollar into more than a dollar when we keep it. And that gets harder, a lot harder as we get bigger. And our success will be less in the future in doing it than it has been in the past, for sure. But if we can keep finding things, then we’ll keep generating cash to buy ’em. (LAUGH)” To me, that sounds like he’s keeping his eye on it.

Europe’s largest oil company said that based on a current cost of supplies, earnings attributable to shareholders hit $3.38bn (£2.62bn) in the three months to the end of March, compared to $814m in the same period last year. Net income, also based on CCS and not taking into account exceptional items, increased by 136 per cent to $3.86bn. A poll of analysts provided by the company had forecast net income of $3.05bn. Read more BP reports higher earnings, helped by recovery in oil prices Shell saw a particularly strong performance in its downstream operations, and chief executive Ben van Beurden said that the company had now completed $20bn of divestments, strengthening its balance sheet. Its acquisition of BG Group early last year also bolstered results.

Gerlach Published 5:58 pm, Wednesday, April 26, 2017 Schertz-Cibolo Universal City ISD officials are bracing for a possible major loss of tax revenue, Superintendent Greg Gibson said at a board meeting April 18. The issue is called “Dark Store” theory where big box retailers argue their stores should be valued as if they were empty, or “dark.” This drops the property assessment value for each location, which in turn reduces the taxes these retailers pay to the county. It’s already happened in Bexar County, with Lowes Home Centers Inc. suing the county’s appraisal district last year. In the lawsuit — rejected by a non-binding arbitration panel in January — Lowes sought to lower its property valuation on 11 of its area stores from $81 per square foot to $34. With Lowes still considering further legal course, according to a company representative, other local retailers such as Kohls, Target and Walmart are already engaged in similar discussions with judges across Texas, according to court records. If these retailers manage to turn the tide of taxation, it could be a catastrophic revenue loss for future bond projects at school districts such as SCUC, said Gibson. “Our bond projects rely heavily on commercial taxes,” Gibson said. “And we have a third high school, a ninth elementary, a fourth intermediate and a third junior high school coming up over the next 10 years. “If commercial value takes a hit, those projects get pushed back,” Gibson added. For a rapidly expanding district that’s “barely able to keep up with all its growth” — and has 100 portable structures in use at any given time — delaying the completion of new campuses could lead to a crisis, Gibson said. According to SCUC ISD records, the 72 square miles within the school district’s boundaries has a total retail property tax base of about $1.25 billion. Theoretically, if that base is reduced as much as Lowes wanted to reduce its value — by around 60 percent — that figure could drop to $48 million. With the average cost of a high school running at about $300 per square foot, according to a 2013 report by education industry publication School Planning and Management, a new high school may cost more than that $48 million property value. And that’s not accounting for the other three campuses the district needs to start building over the next decade. “This is an issue that more people need to pay attention to,” Gibson said. “We’re monitoring it, and we’re planning ahead.”    Catch every San Antonio area moment!

Two weeks before his 28th birthday, Ryan died in the bathroom of a department store. Alone. He was killed by a heroin overdose, yet another victim of the scourge ravaging American communities, most acutely throughout economically depressed, former industrial regions of the country. “I don’t want one more person to die. I’m coming out of the closet about addiction,” Ryan’s mother, Cece Brown, told AFP. Perhaps nowhere is America’s opioid crisis more severe than in Ryan’s native West Virginia, a mountainous state of less than two million people west of the nation’s capital. Coal was once king here, but now is in decline with little to replace it, leaving the local economy badly damaged, and Wal-Mart as the state’s biggest employer. It is a place where most of those looking for hope leave in search of opportunity, and where those without hope often turn to drugs.

In Huntington, a city in the state’s northwest corner portrayed as the epicenter of the nationwide crisis, 28 people overdosed — two fatally — on a single day last August after injecting heroin laced with fentanyl, a dangerous synthetic opioid. “This epidemic doesn’t discriminate,” the town’s mayor Steve Williams told AFP. “Our youngest overdose was 12 years old. The oldest was 77.” – Shining a light – America’s fatal addiction to opioids © AFP / Christopher HUFFAKER, Sophie RAMIS In Cece and Bobby Brown’s small house on a side street of the state capital Charleston, the loss of their younger son feels like a fresh wound. Both stress Ryan had none of the stereotypical signs of a drug user. He excelled at math, won a college scholarship, made friends easily and loved to crack jokes. But he came home after his second year at the University of West Virginia addicted to heroin. His parents only found out when he collapsed of an overdose in the bathroom. Despite years of treatment, and a long period when his life seemed on track, two years ago he went out to the shopping mall with a friend, and never came back. Their willingness to talk and shine a light on the problem, despite the continuing stigma that addicts and their families face, is the tip of the spear in a new strategy to battle the scourge. – From painkillers… to heroin – A woman suspected of acting under the influence of heroine shows her arms to a Huntington police officer in Huntington, West Virginia © AFP / Brendan Smialowski The vast majority of heroin users nationwide resorted to that drug after becoming addicted to powerful pain medications like oxycodone, according to the US Drug Enforcement Agency. The highly addictive narcotics flooded into West Virginia in mind-boggling numbers for years, and unlike heroin were distributed in the open, with the help of “pain clinics” that weren’t overly strict about writing prescriptions, and pharmacies that made no effort to keep tabs on how many pills went out the door. Among those addicts are many older, retired coal miners, who were injured on the job but continued working with the help of pain medication. When their prescriptions were cut off after authorities finally cracked down on the supply — they turned to heroin, sometimes smoking rather than injecting it. But arresting traffickers and users, suing drug companies and distributors and shutting down pharmacies that pumped out pills, has not been enough to stem the flow of drugs. – ‘Full arsenal’ – “We can’t arrest our way out of this problem” — that is the new mantra of all those involved in the fight.

And there are too many facets to the crisis: the overwhelmed jail and foster care systems; the shortage of treatment options and struggles with health insurance coverage; the job prospects of former addicts with a felony on their record. A new DEA pilot program called the 360 Strategy is working with law enforcement and community groups to divert addicts into treatment rather than jail, and educate about the dangers of prescription drugs and heroin. Despite the stepped-up fight, the numbers state-wide don’t look good: deaths are up, it still has the highest overdose rate in the country, and 43 percent of people imprisoned last year had a substance abuse issue so acute they needed immediate medical attention. “Right now under any measurement we are in the midst of a downward spiral and failing miserably,” Huntington’s mayor told AFP. “I am not putting lipstick on a pig.” Attacking a scourge of this magnitude, he says, will require a “full arsenal” — including talking about the problem. – Heartbreak – Ryan’s mother Cece says she wants people to know opioid addiction can happen to anyone, but that there is hope. That hope is sometimes hard to see on the streets of Huntington, where one police officer told AFP “90 percent of what we do is drug related.” One addict being arrested, described the devastation in his life: “I’ve lost the place I stayed at, I’ve lost a lot of good friends,” he said. “Now that I come to think about it, it’s ruined my life a lot.” Winfield police chief Bobby Eggleton spoke of the heartbreak and toll it takes on officers who repeatedly treat the same addicts, like one young couple who overdosed in a car at a gas station, their three-year-old daughter in the back seat. More treatment facilities are key, he said. One young woman who overdosed on that fateful day in August was saved, along with 25 others, by an emergency injection of naloxone, which can stop an overdose in its tracks. It is now standard equipment for police and emergency medical personnel. Six months later, she was finally accepted into a medically-assisted treatment program. But the call came too late: she died two days before.

But rather than bridge these two worlds, the Bluebird card has kept its market walled off. For the most part, American Express has fared well with the Bluebird program, considering it entered a crowded prepaid card field – both within the industry and within Walmart itself, with various other prepaid products sold at the stores, said Ben Jackson, a senior analyst at Mercator Advisory Group.

Two weeks before his 28th birthday, Ryan died in the bathroom of a department store. Alone. He was killed by a heroin overdose, yet another victim of the scourge ravaging American communities, most acutely throughout economically depressed, former industrial regions of the country. "I don't want one more person to die. I'm coming out of the closet about addiction," Ryan's mother, Cece Brown, told AFP. Perhaps nowhere is America's opioid crisis more severe than in Ryan's native West Virginia, a mountainous state of less than two million people west of the nation's capital. Coal was once king here, but now is in decline with little to replace it, leaving the local economy badly damaged, and Wal-Mart as the state's biggest employer. It is a place where most of those looking for hope leave in search of opportunity, and where those without hope often turn to drugs.

Ya Libnan Lebanon News and World News Live from Beirut Featured News Lebanon News World News Opinion Business News Arts & Culture Sci & Tech Video Apple’s cash pile of $250 billion fuels expectations April 30, 2017 by yalibnan 1 Comment In its quarterly results on Tuesday, Apple Inc. likely will report that its cash hoard has topped a quarter of a trillion dollars, an unrivaled milestone for a private corporation that raises a question: Why would any company want to hold that much money? Apple has added to its pile at a blistering pace, doubling it in just over four-and-a-half years. In the last three months of 2016 it wracked up new cash at a rate of about $3.6 million an hour. Its current total, not accounting for debt, exceeds the market values of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and that of Procter & Gamble Co., and outstrips the foreign-currency reserves of the U.K. and Canada combined. The stash has drawn fresh attention recently as President Donald Trump tries to revamp the U.S. tax regime. Apple, like many big companies, keeps most of its cash offshore — some 93% of its $246.09 billion total cash, cash equivalents, and securities as of December — to avoid U.S. corporate taxes that executives consider too high. The Trump administration this week proposed a one-time tax holiday to encourage companies to bring that cash home, and said it wants to slash the U.S. corporate-income-tax rate to 15% from 35% and largely exempt future foreign profits. That could make it easier for Apple to put its money to use, through acquisitions or by doling out more to shareholders. The latter prospect has propelled Apple’s stock to record highs. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook early this year said he was eager to bring cash home if tax changes enable it, and Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said such a move would give Apple flexibility to do more capital returns. Neither has given detailed plans. One possible approach would be a special dividend. Apple could deliver such a windfall, benefitting investors including Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc., which more than doubled its Apple position in January. Wall Street analysts tend to focus more on companies’ net cash position than the headline number. Apple has racked up some $88 billion in debt to fund payouts to shareholders. But even subtracting that, Apple would be left with more cash than the total stockpile of Microsoft, the next richest tech company, which boasts $126 billion in cash, not accounting for debt. With the exception of financial companies, Apple’s stash exceeds that of any other U.S. company in recent history, said Jennifer Blouin, an accounting professor at University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School. “I have never seen a company in this kind of extreme position, barring a winding-down,” she said. “Apple’s a cash box right now.” Former executives say Apple’s thrift has deep roots, inspired in part by a brush with bankruptcy in the late 1990s. That forced Chief Executive Steve Jobs to arrange a cash infusion from Microsoft Corp. and set his resolve to keep reserves for future emergencies. Mr. Jobs also believed Apple could better boost its stock price by using its money to develop new products than through buybacks or dividends. His biggest product, the iPhone, has only supercharged the cash machine. Apple has sold more than 1 billion of the devices in the decade since it was introduced, and today claims 91% of all the profits in the smartphone sector. Mr. Cook has been somewhat more accommodating of shareholder desires than his predecessor. He started a dividend-and-stock-buyback program in 2012 that has since sent more than $200 billion to shareholders. And he has invested more in some areas, such as R&D. But the CEO also stared down Carl Icahn in 2013 and 2014 when the activist investor bought a stake in Apple and demanded it increase buybacks. And Apple remains frugal in other realms, such as marketing. It spent less than $1.8 billion on advertising last year — not even half the amounts laid out by smaller rivals Alphabet Inc. and Amazon.com Inc., according to company filings. Apple also avoids large acquisitions. It bought at a rate of 15 to 20 companies a year over the past four years, generally spending several hundred million dollars on companies it can easily assimilate. Its biggest deal was the $3 billion it spent to buy Beats Electronics LLC in 2014. The swelling war chest has fueled hopes for bigger deals to vault Apple in new directions such as self-driving cars and entertainment. At Apple’s 2015 shareholder meeting, one investor asked Mr. Cook about buying Tesla Inc., which today is valued around $51 billion. The CEO didn’t directly respond. Robert Nichols of Windward Capital Management Co., an Apple shareholder, says it should buy Netflix Inc., valued around $65 billion, to jumpstart its video-streaming business and bolster its position against Amazon. “You can either build [content and distribution] or you can buy it,” and buying would help Apple gain ground where it is behind, he said. With $250 billion, Apple could buy both Tesla and Netflix and still have plenty left over. It also might want to use some cash to pay down some of its debt or look to boost U.S. manufacturing after facing calls last year from then-President-elect Trump to build a plant in the U.S. Either way, there is a growing sense that Apple’s cash hoard has far outstripped its needs. “If this a rainy day fund, they’re saving for a millennial flood,” said Lee Pinkowitz, a Georgetown University professor of finance.   FOX Filed Under: Business News vs Facebook tries to fix violent video problem with 3,000 new workers http://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-crime-idUSKBN17Z1N4 Featured News Trump: Middle East peace is ‘not as difficult as people have thought Trump, Australia’s Turnbull declared that they “get along great” Obama endorses French presidential candidate Macron Trump to Visit Saudi Arabia, Israel and Vatican, Meet With Pope Francis Lebanon News A man who sold his one year old daughter and buyer arrested in Lebanon Aoun, Hariri sign into law a bill that restores Lebanese citizenship to expats Lebanon speaker warns: No deal on an electoral law means “no country or institutions” Beirut to show the world in ‘Design Week’ that ‘Lebanon is not just about political instability’ World News Trump: ‘One of the best chemistries I had was with’ Merkel UK snap election: What does it mean?

Officials identified the victim as Darrick Peters, 21, of Hemet. According to officials, Peters died after he was struck by an SUV. Peters was pronounced dead at the scene of the traffic accident at 5:31 a.m. Officials are still investigating the deadly accident although in a previous press release, Riverside Sheriff’s Sergeant Pohl explained, “There are no initial indications alcohol or drugs played a role in the collision.” Anyone with information about this collision or who witnessed the deadly accident is encouraged to contact Deputy Cortez or Deputy Cox at the San Jacinto Police Station’s Traffic Division at (951) 537-6411. Callers can refer to incident file number I171220012 and can remain anonymous.   ORIGINAL STORY SAN JACINTO – Officials are investigating after a 21-year-old man was fatally struck while crossing a San Jacinto road Tuesday morning, May 2. The fatal, early-morning, vehicle versus pedestrian collision happened on San Jacinto Avenue near Commonwealth Avenue, just west of Wal-Mart, in San Jacinto. Deputies from the Riverside County Sheriff’s San Jacinto Police Station responded to the accident about 5:18 a.m., after the fatal traffic collision was reported to emergency dispatchers, Riverside Sheriff’s Sergeant Matthew Pohl explained in a written press release hours after the deadly accident. When emergency first responders arrived at the scene of the collision they found a Chevrolet Suburban with moderate front-end damage. Officials also located the victim in the middle of the roadway nearby. The victim had suffered major traumatic injuries when he was struck by the large SUV. Medical personnel immediately attempted life-saving efforts; however, the victim succumbed to his injuries and was pronounced dead at the scene of the accident. Officials have not identified the pedestrian, a 21-year-old male resident of Hemet, pending notification of the man’s family. Members of the San Jacinto Police Department’s Traffic Division responded to the scene and conducted an investigation into the cause of the fatal accident. During their investigation, officials determined a white Chevrolet Suburban was traveling southbound on San Jacinto Avenue when the vehicle struck a pedestrian that was crossing the roadway. The intersection where the accident happened has a cross walk; however, it was not immediately known if the victim, who was wearing all dark clothing, was using the cross walk when he was struck. The driver of the vehicle, identified only as a 58-year-old, male resident of San Jacinto, remained at the scene of the accident and was reportedly cooperating with the sheriff’s investigation. “There are no initial indications alcohol or drugs played a role in the collision,” said Pohl. Pohl took the opportunity to remind citizens to follow the rules of the road, cross the street using marked cross walks or intersections and obey signs and signals. “Pedestrians should make eye contact with drivers as they approach and never assume a driver sees you,” said Pohl. “Drivers are encouraged to slow down and look out for pedestrians, especially in hard-to-see conditions such as night or in bad weather.” Anyone with information about this collision or who witnessed the deadly accident is encouraged to contact Deputy Cortez or Deputy Cox at the San Jacinto Police Station’s Traffic Division at (951) 537-6411. Callers can refer to incident file number I171220012 and can remain anonymous.

[Photo provided to China.org.cn]  JinkoSolar, a global leader in the photovoltaic (PV) industry, attended B20 Summit in Berlin on May 2-3 and called for action on the implementation of the Paris Agreement. At the summit, whose theme is "Resilience, Responsibility, Responsiveness - Towards a Future-oriented, Sustainable World Economy," how to promote sustainable development of economy and implement the Paris Agreement are key issues on the agenda. "The implementation of the agreement depends on business involvement and engagement," asserted Qian Jing, vice president of JinkoSolar. "It is time for businesses to take action." She said, "Starting from their own expertise and experience, companies can, for example, steer their capital towards direct investment in clean energy projects and low carbon, energy efficient technology and businesses, purchase and increase use of renewable energy, and become carbon neutral." She used giants like Apple, Google and Walmart as examples to elaborate her point -- These companies have been actively implementing sustainable development strategies and promoting renewable energy projects to fulfill the target of running entirely on renewable energy. JinkoSolar, a global leader in the photovoltaic (PV) industry, attends B20 Summit in Berlin on May 2-3. [Photo provided to China.org.cn] Companies also can report emissions and disclose climate change relevant data and information, adapt their business model and supply chain to seize this energy transition opportunity and create new jobs, internally price carbon, comply and align with government climate and energy regulation, support developing low carbon technology and science, and take a responsible approach to lobbying on climate action. Qian believed if enterprises can seize the opportunity brought by energy transformation, a new growth engine will emerge for enterprises. JinkoSolar has been committed to reducing the cost of solar power and helping enterprises shift energy structure and turn more sustainable, and thus implement the Paris Agreement. Carbon trade and carbon pricing are at the exploration stage and need unified standards. China will launch a national carbon emission trade system in 2017, putting itself on a path towards green, low-carbon and climate change-adaptive economy. This year's B20 Summit has proposed building a platform dedicated to the strategic dialogue for carbon pricing, meaning that solid progress will be made on carbon trade in 2017. Qian said, "We hope G20 governments cooperatively launch a unified carbon market on a broader spectrum, design rules, guidelines, procedures to help parties establish trading schemes, establish a dedicated committee or consultancy group to help countries with carbon market building and pricing setting to address gaps and needs."

Related: Katy Perry Slammed Over Insensitive Met Gala Photo The extremely frou-frou affair does not welcome smokers, vapers, and everyone in between into its hallowed halls, and now it's being reported that several museum donors are FURIOUS that some celebs were puffing up a storm in the museum's bathrooms. One donor told Page Six: "As a donor to the Met, I was so insulted to see all these ‘celebrities' smoking and taking selfies of themselves in the bathroom. Mostly, it's disrespectful to the art collection which needs to be kept 100 percent smoke-free. I would honestly like to see these people fined by the city." A board member also expressed outrage when she entered the bathroom Monday to discover stars like Diddy, Paris Jackson, Kendall Jenner, Kim Kardashian, and Kylie Jenner goofing around and taking selfies. Apparently some of them were also smoking. A source said: "The board member stormed right out and complained right away to Anna Wintour's team. It is so disrespectful to the museum." Well, one person who was DEFINITELY smoking was Dakota Johnson (above), who was caught lighting up in one of Rita Ora's Snapchats from the night. An unidentified guy behind her can also be seen vaping. Besides them, Rami Malek and Bella Hadid were also spotted puffing, as were Marc Jacobs and Frances Bean Cobain (below): [Image via Instagram/Snapchat.] Advertising info 'Many People Will Die' -- See All The Strong Reactions To The GOP Finally Passing Their Devastating Obamacare Replacement Bill GOP's Shitty Obamacare Replacement Bill Will Consider Rape A Pre-Existing Condition -- But That's Not All...

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 4 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman May 1 – 7: Bristol’s Weekly Traffic Alert BRISTOL – In an effort to keep motorists informed, the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) provides weekly information about highway construction and maintenance projects in southwestern Virginia. When traveling through highway work zones, use caution and be alert to changes in traffic patterns and slow-moving or stopped traffic.   To help motorists take the guesswork out of travel plans, call VDOT’s 511 or visit http://www.511Virginia.org/ for real-time traffic information.   Underlined entries with asterisks (***) indicate the listing is new or the status of the project has changed since last week’s traffic alert.     INTERSTATE PROJECTS ***Interstate 81 – Exit 14:  Work is underway to reconstruct Interstate 81 exit 14 to better accommodate traffic volumes and to replace the north and southbound interstate 81 bridges at exit 14.

Traffic should use the I-81 on ramps at exits 44 and 47. Motorists should also be alert to the possibility of lane closures north and southbound on Interstate 81 near exit 45 in Marion due to repairs to the bridges over Matson Drive.  (Completion: May 2017)   ***Interstate 77 – maintenance activities: Be alert to lane closures on I-77 this week due to bridge and shoulder sweeping in Wythe and Bland counties.   ***Interstate 81 – maintenance activities: Be alert to lane closures due to the following maintenance activities on I-81: Bland County Route 601 bridge replacement: Due to replacement of the Route 601 bridge over Little Walker Creek in Bland County, be alert to workers in the work zone as well as traffic shifts.

LaVar Ball unveiled several styles of footwear on his company's web store Thursday, which he's promoting on behalf of son Lonzo a month before the former UCLA star is expected to be the first or second pick in June's NBA Draft, news.com.au reported. The signature black-and-gold shoe, "ZO2 Prime by Lonzo Ball," is on sale for a whopping US$495. Those who wear a size 14 of 15 are expected to cough up another US$200 for the sneakers.

The sandals alone require US$220. Big Baller's loose! If you can't afford the ZO2'S, you're NOT a BIG BALLER! — Lavar Ball (@Lavarbigballer) May 4, 2017 The shoes' release comes a week after all three sneaker giants denied Lonzo an endorsement deal, making him the first anticipated top pick to go without an offer. The companies likely were turned off by LaVar's conditions for the deal, which insisted the company partner with Big Baller Brand and consider a shoe he designed himself. Then there was Nike executive George Raveling calling LaVar "the worst thing to happen to basketball in the last hundred years." Continued below.

The shoes are now available for pre-ordering on the company’s website. “The shoe was made independently by my family brand,” Ball said in a promotional video. “Creating the shoe was a lot of fun, especially being able to add my own creative input throughout the process. I look forward to working with my fellow athletes, pushing the culture forward and empowering the upcoming generation.” The Big Baller Brand revealed the ZO2 footwear line whose main offering is the ZO2 Prime, a low-top basketball sneaker that “was meticulously developed at every stage by Lonzo Ball,” according to the website. It is priced at $495 on the company website, but if you wear sizes 14 or 15, you have to shell out $695 for a pair. A Slam Magazine report said the ZO2 Prime will cost $495 because the brand “is aiming for Lonzo’s signature sneaker to tap into a new market – above the athletic performance kicks from the likes of Nike, Jordan, Adidas and Under Armour, but below the high-end designer shoes of Gucci, Prada or Louis Vuitton.” There’s also the ZO2 Wet that has a price tag of $995 ( $1,195 for sizes 14 and 15). Autographed by Ball, it will come in a key-locked acrylic glass box “with cool white LED lighting.” And if you think both of these are a bit too expensive for you, then you might want to buy the ZO2 Slide, which are not exactly basketball shoes but slippers with Ball’s insignia. These are being sold for $220. The Big Baller Brand website clearly mentions that no refunds or exchanges are offered, and that all sales of the ZO2 are final. And irrespective of which pair you choose to buy, the footwear will be shipped only by Nov. 24. The release of the signature line came one week after ESPN reported that apparel giants like Adidas, Nike or Under Armour had turned down the licensing deal offered to them by Lavar Ball, the player’s father. “We said from the beginning, we aren’t looking for an endorsement deal,” Lavar Ball told ESPN last week. “We’re looking for co-branding, a true partner. But they’re not ready for that because they’re not used to that model. But hey, the taxi industry wasn’t ready for Uber, either.” Ball is the first basketball player to have his very own independently made signature shoe line before his pick for the NBA draft is finalized. Other apparel on the Big Baller Brand website includes shirts for both men and women, as well as hats, ranging from $38 to $100. Social media users criticized the sneakers, calling them too expensive. Hall of Fame center Shaquille O'Neal, whose shoes retail for between $13 and $68 at Walmart, also commented on the ZO2 in a tweet. Lavar Ball responded to the tweets, defending the high price tag in an unusual way. There were also some others who supported the Baller way of brand-building. "You have to respect Lavar being entrepreneurial, betting on himself and trying to build a business," said Jason Stein, CEO of New York-based ad agency Laundry Service. "He's a larger-than-life character and generating a ton of attention. The shoes are nothing special and grossly overpriced, but I suspect that's intentional. In the context of building a brand — his brand — it's working,” Stein added, according to ESPN.

One Huntsville family learned the hard way while trying to rent a home. Brieanna Cannon said it was the home for their dreams, because it was a three bedroom two baths in the South Huntsville when they discovered it. "All of the utilities was included, that`s kind of what we were looking for you know," Cannon said. The ad claimed it was only $750.00 a month to rent. "We all felt like it was too good to be true but we didn't want to pass up an opportunity," Cannon explained. The alleged owner told them he was out of town on business, but encouraged them to go look at the house by gong in through an unlocked side-door. They thought it was perfect, so they paid $1750.00 via Walmart money gram for the deposit and rent. In the meantime they were told to go ahead and move into the home, but after only a few days of actually living in it they got a surprising phone call. They were told they weren't renters, but unwelcome guests. They were also told someone else actually owned the home and they were squatting. The family was given two days to get out. Better Business Bureau President of North Alabama Elizabeth Garcia said rental property scams are all too common. "The key red flags are a low price that`s not normal for that market and type of house or type of apt. Also, someone who is not willing to meet with you to do a walk through, or wire transfer money. Those are key red flags," Garcia said. It was the same red flags the Cannon family experienced, but looked past. "Because everyone gets scammed and you think it will never happen to you and then it does. You`re really a lost for words, of how people can treat other people and take their money," Cannon said.   Filed in: Huntsville Suggest a correction × Suggest A Correction Your name Your email Report a typo or grammatical error Cancel Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest LinkedIn Email Popular Fisherman lands massive catfish on the Lake Guntersville causeway Mugshot of woman with black eyes, blonde hair goes viral Fidget spinners, cubes are helping kids (and adults) with ADHD, anxiety Latest News GSC softball tournament starts Friday New ATF data reveals gun theft and loss are on the rise nationwide; Alabama among states hit hardest The future of the Huntsville Municipal Golf Course remains uncertain Power outage in Hazel Green Huntsville Family escapes with no injuries after a tree falls into their bedroom Huntsville Concerned citizens ask Huntsville City Council and Mayor to create a sanctuary city The Story Relative passes down love of antiques to gallery owner News University of Missouri students spend spring break serving people in Madison County News On a Flight for His Life: Meet Madison’s Miracle Michael Moretti Huntsville The Story Love and music fill the air at flash mob proposal Community Huntsville Hospital gives out free infant CPR kits to NICU parents Eat.

Dead Cross Share Blistering First Single “Grave Slave” Home News John Wyatt May 4th, 2017 - 4:58 PM You’re going to want to make sure your headphones are turned way up when you first press play on this new track, it’s mixed pretty quiet. While Faith No More frontman Mike Patton and infamous Slayer drummer Dave Lombardo have collaborated before, the two are officially joining forces.  Their new band, Dead Cross, is a brutal, no punches pulled hardcore supergroup consisting of the two metal heavyweights as well as members of Retox and Locust. Now…their new track. Anything but gentle or relaxing, this new song indicates a very “no f*cks given” attitude, as the song beats you over the head with pounding drums (Lombardo does it better than anybody) and Patton screeches and groans and makes so many noises I never thought was humanly possible. This song will make you break your computer then go get in a fight in the Wal-Mart parking lot at 1 AM in the span of under two minutes. Their self-titled debut project is due out this summer (8/4) and reportedly less than half an hour long, with a cover of Bauhaus’ “Bela Lugosi’s Dead,” contributing to the short project. The project was recorded with Ross Robinson, who has worked with virtually every metal band in the 90’s, as well as At the Drive-In for their Relationship of Command project and Blood Brothers’ Burn, Paino Island, Burn. Take a deep breath, make sure there are no small children, and press play on their new song.

Hannah WithiamNY Post Share Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on Reddit Email a friend NIKE, Under Armour and Adidas, meet your newest competition, Big Baller Brand. Population: two. LaVar Ball unveiled several styles of footwear on his company’s web store Thursday, which he’s promoting on behalf of son Lonzo a month before the former UCLA star is expected to be the first or second pick in June’s NBA Draft. The signature black-and-gold shoe, “ZO2 Prime by Lonzo Ball,” is on sale for a whopping $495. Those who wear a size 14 of 15 are expected to cough up another $200 for the sneakers. In anticipation of Lonzo’s successful career in the NBA — which will include “seven” championship rings, LaVar has said — the website also is offering shoes personally autographed by the future pro for $995 and $1,195. The sandals alone require $220. Big Baller's loose! If you can't afford the ZO2'S, you're NOT a BIG BALLER! 💰— Lavar Ball (@Lavarbigballer) May 4, 2017 LaVar and Lonzo are not off to a good start.Source:AP The shoes’ release comes a week after all three sneaker giants denied Lonzo an endorsement deal, making him the first anticipated top pick to go without an offer. The companies likely were turned off by LaVar’s conditions for the deal, which insisted the company partner with Big Baller Brand and consider a shoe he designed himself. Then there was Nike executive George Raveling calling LaVar “the worst thing to happen to basketball in the last hundred years.” Now going solo, LaVar Ball has grand plans for his brand’s growth. “Lonzo Ball and Big Baller Brand are on a journey to change the game forever,” the website reads.

Nike Inc. , adidas AG , Hanes and Under Armour Inc. were the most sought-after brands, with at least 20% of respondents naming them. Morgan Stanley AlphaWise polled 1,000 adults aged 18 and over from April 4 to April 12. "We expect consumer expectations around seeing more dressier and formal attire brands to grow as Amazon's private label brands gain traction," analysts wrote in the Friday note. Nearly half of respondents (46%) purchased clothes from Amazon in the last year, second only to Wal-Mart Stores Inc. with 60%. And nearly half (47%) of likely Amazon apparel shoppers said they expect to buy more clothes from the e-commerce giant in the next 12 months and fewer pieces from other retailers. Analysts say Amazon's 2016 share gains came out of department stores and Target Corp. . Clothing sales at Amazon appears to be driven by Prime members, who are 1.5 times more likely than non-prime members to buy clothes from the site. Amazon shares are up 3% in premarket trading, and up 52.6% for the past year. The S&P 500 index is up 15.1% for the last 12 months.

Farm Operations>Disaster ‘Wildfire relief effort not over’ Pennebaker and Hollaway agree that farm families do not hesitate to help others during disasters that hit agricultural areas. But when a massive disaster hits over a broad area, they need help from other regions. The response, they say, was overwhelming and gratifying. Ron Smith 1 | May 04, 2017 The 2017 Southwest wildfire relief effort is not over. In fact, two months after deadly wildfires burned almost 2 million acres in West Texas, Oklahoma, Colorado and Kansas, some ranchers have suffered additional losses from early spring blizzards and flooding. That last-gasp of winter resulted in some livestock deaths as well as severe damage to forage and wheat crops some ranchers were looking to for much needed cash flow. Related: USDA offers wildfire recovery assistance Melanie Pennebaker, an east Oklahoma rancher who has traveled across much of the wildfire-ravaged Southwest in recent weeks, says livestock losses from the fires are still being assessed but may total from 20,000 to 40,000 head. “Many ranchers lost 80 percent of their herds,” Pennebaker says, “and that’s compounded for many by lost wheat crops.” A lot of wheat acreage was damaged by a February ice storm before the wildfire roared across the Southern Plains. An early May blizzard damaged more of the grain crop.In addition to lost livestock, thousands of miles of ruined fencing pushes financial losses well beyond what government aid or insurance will cover. Pennebaker says fence replacement costs $10,000 per mile. “Thousands of miles of fencing have been lost across the four states.” She says government help is capped at $200,000. Andy Holloway, county Extension agent in Hemphill County, Texas, says more than 2,500 head of cattle were lost in the county, and that figure could be low as some ranchers may not have reported totals yet. PATIENCE IS ESSENTIAL Holloway says the most expensive aspect of recovery may be lost time. “They need to be patient,” he says, before putting cattle back on burned rangeland. “It will take a long time for the land to recover, and ranchers need to give rangeland time to heal.” He says rainfall has stimulated grass emergence, but the area now needs some warm weather. Pennebaker says Medicine Lodge, Kansas, was not affected by the 2017 wildfire but did lose a lot of grassland in 2016. “Much of that rangeland has not recovered a year later,” she says. Holloway says much of the grassland in Hemphill County is tall grass, big and little blue stem, among other types. “We have good soils, although it’s a bit sandy. Still, it will take time to recover. “We’re seeing a lot of greenup now and it’s pretty. A lot of weeds, sages, forbs and some grasses are coming back following recent rains, and we need that—something to keep the sand from blowing. If everything stays ideal, we can probably start grazing in late fall—if it doesn’t turn hot and dry.” He adds that less productive soils will take longer to reestablish grazing. Grass management before the fire also plays a role. “If it was well managed, grass roots will extend 12 to 14 feet deep. If it was overgrazed, roots will go down only three or four feet. Overgrazed grass will take longer to recover. “That’s why we preach a grass and animal management system,” he says. “We expect drought, so we have to prepare and manage for it.” MASSIVE RELIEF EFFORT Pennebaker says the wildfires were so widespread that they overwhelmed the region’s ability to manage recovery efforts. “Some of the fires were blazing to 20 or 40 feet high,” she says, “and with 70 mile per hour winds the situation could have been much worse.” She says some towns “barely escaped being destroyed. And a lot of ranchers barely escaped with their lives.” Many ranchers had too little or no insurance on their livestock, and some had none on barns or their homes. They were also isolated from immediate assistance. “The Panhandle area is very rural,” she says. “It’s a long way to a fast food place or a Walmart, so folks had few emergency resources. And the damage was so widespread that farmers and ranchers could not help each other; they had to take care of themselves.” She explains that when isolated disaster hits a farming community, nearby farmers and ranchers rally to provide whatever help is necessary. A disaster as widespread as the 2017 wildfire required outside assistance. “A massive relief effort has saved a lot of people,” she says. And help came from across the country. Holloway says the disaster was a two-sided coin. “The first side is the tragedy,” he says. “The flip side is the outpouring of generosity that gives me a lot of hope for our country.” He says donated hay came from everywhere. “We have hay from Nebraska, New Mexico, Kansas, Tennessee, Louisiana and South Texas, among other places. We’ve also received donations of feed, fencing and pipe. It has been amazing.” INFORMATION HUB Pennebaker began collecting and disseminating information about relief needs and opportunities for volunteers as she made a trip to deliver a donation she and her husband made. “We had a horse that we were not using on our ranch,” she says. “We have 500 acres, and we work our cattle with dogs. We heard about the fires and thought that someone would need a ranch horse.” She got the word out through social media, and a lot of folks expressed interest. They finally settled on a family from Kansas that had lost their ranch horse to burn injuries. They loaded the horse on the trailer along with other needed items, including a horse another rancher donated, and took it all to Kansas. During the trip, she stopped at drop points to see what was needed and found that relief efforts in some states were not running as smoothly as it needed to and that information was not always available.  She started gathering information and set up a Facebook page to help people find help and for others to identify where help was needed. She created the 2017 Wildfire Relief page on Facebook to help get information out. “We have 1,000 members,” she says at http://bit.ly/2paSAL4 . The page provides updates, helpful information, statistics, information sources, and possibly as important as anything, encouragement and support. Pennebaker adds that other states and entities have developed wildfire information services, and notes that Michigan has a large following. “My goal has been to gather and share information,” Pennebaker says. “We want to identify areas with the most pressing needs.” MORE THAN HAY NEEDED She discovered early on that as hay, feedstuff and some fencing materials were coming in, the need for household goods was not being met. Items for children were also needed, so they made that information available and donations, including children’s toys, began coming in.” She says another project that has found support through social media is barbed wire recycling. They collect tumbleweed-shaped rolls of discarded barbed wire and recycle them into craft pieces. The web page sows photos of crosses, lamps, and heart wreaths--all made from recycled burned barbed wire.They use proceeds from the sale of the old barbed wire to purchase new barbed wire. Pennebaker says the Texas wildfire relief effort was the most organized. “Within 24 hours they had drop points established and help available,” she says. “Other states were less organized.” That's why she and others began setting up relief pages on Facebook and other social media outlets. She says the massive support across the region depended on thousands of volunteers. “The relief effort would not have been possible without volunteer truck drivers,” she adds. “The need is not over,” she says. “A number of camps are still set up to accept and disburse donations and to give truckers a place to rest; convoys are still moving donations, and people are still in need.” She says the late blizzard will extend those needs, especially in Central Kansas. “Ranchers there need hay now,” she says, “and they will need hay well into the summer. On top of the fire, we’ve also had cold weather and heavy rains that caused flooding.” Pennebaker and Holloway agree that farm families do not hesitate to help others during disasters that hit agricultural areas. But when a massive disaster hits over a broad area, they need help from other regions. The response, they say, was overwhelming and gratifying. “I know that it could have been us,” Pennebaker says. “Next time, it might be our ranch.” TAGS: Animal Health Livestock Handling 0 comments Hide comments Comment * More information about text formats Text format CommentsPlain text Comments Allowed HTML tags: <em> <strong> <blockquote> <br> <p> Plain text No HTML tags allowed.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 4 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Former Treasurer Repays Funds Swindled From Agricultural Society Columbus – A former treasurer who paid scammers $60,491 with Madison County Agricultural Society funds finished repaying the entity in March, according to a report released today by Auditor of State Dave Yost.  Brenda Roseberry was in charge of filing the agricultural society’s tax returns and paying its taxes, but she neglected to perform these duties during her tenure as treasurer. So she had little reason to question the credibility of individuals posing as IRS employees who in September 2014 called demanding payment for back taxes. “Roseberry is a victim of her own crime,” Auditor Yost said. “Had she performed her fiscal responsibilities in accordance with the law, she may have seen through this smoke screen. Instead, she made herself a perfect target.” The callers instructed Roseberry to purchase prepaid Green Dot cards and relay the card information over the phone. Roseberry complied, taking $60,491 from the agricultural society’s bank accounts without proper authorization to buy the cards at a local Giant Eagle. Most of the cards were cashed at Wal-Mart stores in Texas, but investigators linked the perpetrators to a network of scammers that funneled the money to India.  Roseberry pleaded guilty on Oct. 2, 2015, to a fifth-degree felony count of failure to file return and pay withholding. She was sentenced the following December to two years of probation and ordered to pay restitution, court fees and audit costs. Robert F. Smith of the Auditor’s office served as special prosecutor for the case.  The agricultural society entered into a settlement agreement with Roseberry on May 9, 2016, requiring her to pay restitution for losses that resulted from the scam and tax penalties. At the time of the settlement, she had paid more than $35,800. Roseberry owed an additional $38,000 under the agreement, which she finished paying with a check dated March 30, 2017. Auditor Yost in June 2016 advised local governments to remain vigilant due to an increase in scams targeting local governments. More information is available on the Auditor of State’s cybersecurity webpage. A full copy of this report is available online.  ### The Auditor of State’s office, one of five independently elected statewide offices in Ohio, is responsible for auditing more than 5,900 state and local government agencies.  Under the direction of Auditor Dave Yost, the office also provides financial services to local governments, investigates and prevents fraud in public agencies and promotes transparency in government.

One student at the University of Houston is turning the controversy of the flag into art. Second-year Master of Fine Arts candidate Alton DuLaney unveiled “ART Rebel,” a Confederate flag with the word “art” placed in the center, at the Blaffer Art Museum on Friday. The 8-by-12-foot artwork is inspired by a quote from former President Barack Obama saying the flag “belongs in a museum” and not on public buildings. “What if we take this flag, use it as inspiration, re-contextualize it inside the museum, rename it and call it art?” DuLaney said. “How does that change the impact, the whole meaning of it and how people see it?” DuLaney said he attempted to take a neutral stance on the project and present it in a way that would encourage the audience to have a collective, public conversation about the issue. “It’s elevating it in a way to the status of art,” DuLaney said, “but it’s also reducing it to just art.” DuLaney uses flags and a red, white and blue palette for many of his projects. “I like to examine these objects that are right on the edge,” DuLaney said. “In my work, it’s about pride, power and patriotism.” During last year’s student exhibition, DuLaney presented a similar project called “ART Gun,” a response to the recently enacted campus carry law. Because part of the work involved a firearm — a revolver enclosed in a glass frame — DuLaney could not display the entire piece. The University of Houston Police Department would not allow the gun to be shown in a campus museum, DuLaney said, even though the law meant students could have one in their pocket. Similar to his intentions with “ART Rebel,” DuLaney said last year that he wanted “ART Gun” to spark conversations regarding campus carry. “I’m really happy that the Blaffer Art Museum collaborated with me to get this piece in the show,” DuLaney said. “Because they could have said no, but they didn’t. They made it happen and were very encouraging.” Michael Charles, an art professor and a member of DuLaney’s advisory board, said much of DuLaney’s work explores issues such as identity and race. “I think Alton’s piece is pretty timely, given the fact that he has done this, and it’s hanging on the walls now, and there’s debates about the civil war on the television, radio and internet today,” Charles said. DuLaney said he revealed his project at a relevant time for discussions on issues of Confederate symbols. New Orleans began removing four Civil War-era monuments on April 24. The New York Times reported that protests arose from supporters who deemed the memorials historically important, while critics of the monuments viewed them as racist symbols. “I think we’re at a moment right now that is very important that we’re looking at this,” Dulaney said. “We should be having this conversation.” Even though DuLaney’s piece is not an actual Confederate flag, he struggled with finding the original design for his project since the flag is no longer sold in most stores. After Dylann Roof shot nine people at the AME Emanuel Church in 2015, CNN reported that the Confederate flag was removed from stores such as Walmart, Amazon, Sears and eBay DuLaney said he is interested in how inanimate objects can have power over an audience. “Even though I redesigned it, it still obviously has a lot of power to it,” Dulaney said. “People are reacting very strongly to it.” “ART” is a signature statement inscribed across all DuLaney’s projects. He said he is interested in the ability of words to change an image and he believes the project would be interpreted differently if the word “history” or “shame” were on the piece instead. “I am not trying to glamorize or glorify that image,” DuLaney said. “I am not trying to disrespect or desecrate it either — I am just trying to present it.” As a United States history professor, Steven Deyle said his perception of the project was that the word “ART” written across the flag seemed to deprive the image of its power. He said he finds it much more offensive in someone’s yard than in the context of art. “I’m not offended by this as much as I am by other people who embrace it for other reasons,” Deyle said. “It’s not empowering this flag. It’s sort of diffusing it by turning it into art.” Audience member and corporate communications alumnus Christian Ohuabunwa said he viewed the project as a Confederate flag without any connotations, and that it changed the conversation about the symbol. “Everything is symbolism,” Ohuabunwa said. “When you see the word ‘ART’ boldly, your mind does not shout that it’s a Confederate flag, but a flag with the word ‘ART.’” DuLaney’s “ART Rebel” will be displayed in the School of Art student exhibition at the Blaffer Art Museum until May 13. “I hope people can look at it and talk about it in a non-heated kind of way,” DuLaney said. “If you can’t talk about these things in the world of art and academia, where can you talk about them?” [email protected] Tags: art exhibition, Blaffer Art Musem, campus carry, Confederate Flag Mohammed bin Zayed Jones It’s … ART.

Major flooding in Oklahoma, Missouri and Illinois has also triggered extensive damage to homes and businesses. HOUSE CRASHES INTO ARKANSAS BRIDGE AFTER SEVERE STORMS At least nine people in the region have died due to flooding and rescue operations are ongoing for an 18-month-old Arkansas girl who is missing. Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson has activated more than 100 National Guard troops to assist with recovery and rescue operations. State police are also assisting and more than 500 people have been evacuated.  TEXAS DAY CARE DESTROYED IN FIRE “It’s really extraordinary that five rivers have breached their banks and there’s substantial flooding in multiple counties in Northeast Arkansas,” Hutchinson said. “As a result of that I’ve declared a state of emergency in about 20 counties in the state.” Hutchinson said there were nine levee breaches on Wednesday forcing water to flow into new areas. He noted that water in some of the affected areas has started to recede, but homes and business have been damaged. Parts of Pocahontas, Ark., one of the hardest hit areas of the state was put under a mandatory evacuation order. In Randolph County where the 5 rivers are flooding Pocahontas.

Asa Hutchinson (@AsaHutchinson) May 2, 2017 The Black River rose to a record 28.95 feet before spilling over levees, according to National Weather Service meteorologist Gary Woodall. The previous record was 28.5 feet. Woodall notes that rain is expected to move out of the region, but flooding in the area could last into next week. “While we don’t see a lot more water coming into the drainage basin, what’s there is going to persist for a long time,” Woodall said. “So it’s going to be a slow process as far as recovering and getting those water levels back down below flood stage.” The American Red Cross of Arkansas has set up four shelters and started serving hot meals to those affected by the flooding.

Source: AAP 5 May 2017 - 6:12 AM  UPDATED 10 HOURS AGO Tweet The United States will shoot itself in the foot if it quits the Paris climate accord because China, India and Europe will snap up the best power sector jobs in future, UN Environment chief Erik Solheim says. US President Donald Trump is expected to announce as early as next week whether he will take the United States out of the climate pact, having vowed during his campaign to "cancel the Paris Climate Agreement" within 100 days of becoming president. "There is no doubt where the future is and that is what all the private sector companies have understood," Solheim told Reuters in Geneva. "The future is green," he said. "Obviously if you are not a party to the Paris agreement, you will lose out. And the main losers of course will be the people of the United States itself because all the interesting, fascinating new green jobs would go to China and to the other parts of the world that are investing heavily in this." The world has now passed its "peak oil" stage, the Norwegian-born Solheim said, and was rapidly moving into the age of solar and wind. The Paris accord, agreed by nearly 200 countries in 2015, seeks to limit planetary warming by cutting emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases from burning fossil fuels. "Wind engineer is now probably the most promising job opportunity in the United States," Solheim said, adding that China and India were bringing the price of solar down so fast that coal was no longer competitive. He said the green revolution was being led by iconic firms such as Google, Walmart, Microsoft, Apple and Facebook, so the momentum does not depend on Washington. "Even if the worst were to happen and the United States were to withdraw, the consequences would be much less than people think," he said. Political leadership would shift to the European Union, China and India, and the UN is already talking to them about meeting the funding gap if the United States steps back - not only from the climate deal but UN funding in general.

Jeb Hensarling last month — to the full house for consideration, likely sometime next month. According to The Hill, today’s 34-26 party-line vote came after nearly 24 hours of debate and markups of the bill, which included several amendments that would have preserved some of the provisions under the Dodd-Frank Act. The 589-page legislation [PDF], which has received significant opposition from advocates, retailers, and others, is a revision of the previous Financial CHOICE Act introduced by Hensarling last year. As it stands, the Financial CHOICE 2.0 Act would, among other things: • Require the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to get congressional approval before taking enforcement action against financial institutions • Restrict the Bureau’s ability to write rules regulating financial companies • Revoke the agency’s authority to restrict arbitration • Revoke the CFPB’s authority to conduct education campaigns • Prevent the Bureau from making public the complaints it collects from consumers in its Consumer Complaint Database • Revamp the agency’s structure by allowing the CFPB director to be fired at will by the President • Require the agency’s budget to be subject to the annual congressional appropriations process • Prevent the CFPB from having oversight over the payday lending industry • Rename the CFPB to the Consumer Law Enforcement Agency • Require banks to undergo stress tests every other year, with banks agreeing to increase their capital never having to undergo stress tests • Revoke the so-called qualitative test that evaluates a bank’s plan for managing capital and risk • Remove requirements under the Durbin Amendment [PDF] that guided how much credit card networks could charge retailers for processing debit card transactions The bill’s approval by the House Financial Service Committee was met with strong opposition by consumer advocates, the retail industry, and other lawmakers. Our colleagues at Consumers Union say the bill’s approval puts consumers at risk while protecting the financial interests of big banks and shady lenders. “Congress created the CFPB to ensure consumers get a fair deal and to protect them from predatory practices that can undermine their financial security,” Pamela Banks, senior policy counsel for Consumers Union, said in a statement. “This bill strips the CFPB of most of its power and would leave consumers vulnerable to fraud, hidden fees and costly gotchas by banks and unscrupulous financial firms.” Several groups, including the National Consumer Law Center, Americans for Financial Reform, and Public Citizen, lambasted the bill’s provision restricting the CFPB and Security and Exchange Commission’s authority to restrict forced arbitration. “Contrary to its title, H.R. 10 would deprive consumers and investors of any choice of their day in court when resolving serious disputes with powerful financial institutions and force them into a rigged system,” Amanda Werner, arbitration campaign manager with Americans for Financial Reform and Public Citizen, said in a statement. Werner noted that forced arbitration clauses “only serve to kill consumer class action lawsuits and cover up widespread fraud and abuse.” The Center For American Progress said in a statement that the Financial CHOICE Act is only the right choice for Wall Street bankers. “It shows a blatant disregard for the painful lessons learned during the 2007–2008 financial crisis,” Marc Jarsulic, Vice President for Economic Policy at the Center for American Progress, said in a statement. “The so-called CHOICE Act removes protections against taxpayer-funded bailouts, erodes consumer protections, and undercuts necessary tools to hold Wall Street accountable.” Even the retail industry, which had urged Congress to not roll back financial reforms involving debit card transactions, called out the Committee for moving forward with the legislation. The Retail Industry Leaders Association — which counts a number of major retailers, such as Apple, Best Buy, Gap, Target, Walmart, and others, as members — said in a statement that it would keep fighting the Financial CHOICE Act’s provisions related to swipe fees. RILA and other industry groups believe that by revoking the swipe fee reforms, retailers would pass on the new, more expensive processing costs to consumers. “While we believe in financial reforms that make sense for America’s community banks and local credit unions, the repeal of hard-fought debit swipe fee reform included in the CHOICE Act gives big banks and card networks a green light to raise costs on every business in America that accepts debit cards,” Austen Jensen, Vice President of Government Affairs and Financial Services for RILA, said in a statement. On the other side of the debate, the American Bankers Association called today’s vote an important step. “We commend Chairman Hensarling and members of the Committee for their tireless efforts to help our nation’s banking industry serve their customers and communities,” Rob Nichols, ABA president and CEO, said in a statement, calling the Financial CHOICE Act “needed regulatory relief.” May 4, 2017 By Ashlee Kieler@akieler bill cfpb consumer financial protection bureau financial choice act Financial CHOICE Act 2.0 gutting dodd-frank house financial services committee Jeb Hensarling moving forward restrictions retail Rolling Back Protections Tell a friend: Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window) Click to email (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Related on the attack Lawmakers Introduce Legislation That Would Abolish The CFPB taking away authority ‘Financial Choice Act 2.0’ Would Eliminate Government’s Ability To Go After Shady Payday Loan Operations reforming the reform Bank-Backed Congressman Introducing Law To Gut Consumer Financial Protections a look into the crystal ball Future Looks Dim For Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Under Trump Presidency a shadow of what's to come Trump Order Targeting Dodd-Frank Reforms Is Largely Symbolic, Still Cause For Concern Previous Canada Recalling Bombay Sapphire Gin That Contains Dangerous Amount Of Alcohol Next House Closes Loophole Protecting Members From Losing Insurance Benefits; Still Leaves Veterans’ Tax Credits At Risk Part of  Founded in 2005, Consumerist is an independent source of consumer news and information published by Consumer Media LLC, a not-for-profit subsidiary of Consumer Reports.

Skip to Navigation St. Louis Review Search: Archdiocese of Saint Louis Twitter Facebook RSS Representatives of diverse groups back ‘Ban the Box’ policies Submitted on May 04, 2017 By Joseph Kenny | jkenny@archstl.org | twitter: @josephkenny2 Faced with the "box," many people returning from prison fear there may be no way for them to make a living. The "box" refers to a check box on job applications that asks about criminal history. Recently, community leaders, activists, small businesses, nonprofit organizations and corporate allies stress the need to give individuals a fair chance to obtain employment by banning the "box." At Lindenwood University April 28, Jordan Richardson, an attorney and senior policy analyst with the Charles Koch Institute, told a gathering representing the varied groups that criminal justice reform is one in which conservatives and libertarians have similar views as more liberal-minded groups. Checking the box means an individual often won't even get a call for an interview, Richardson said. Koch Industries has banned the box and found that employees it hired who had a criminal record are good workers, and many earn promotions. "When we talk about 'Ban the Box,' we're talking about human dignity," Richardson said at the event sponsored by the Hammond Institute for Free Enterprise, echoing a concept of Catholic teaching about the dignity of work. Having a job is the number one indicator of whether someone leaving prison will avoid reincarceration, Richardson said, noting that 650,000 people are released from prisons each year (U.S. Department of Justice figures). "No one should be defined by the worst day, and they should be free to pursue their God-given talents," Richardson said. The Missouri Legislature has considered bills requiring public employers (state and local governments) to defer a criminal background check until after the job interview has been conducted or until a conditional offer of employment has been made. Public employers may still conduct a background check and refuse to hire a person. The Missouri Catholic Conference supported the legislation, saying it would lower recidivism and help ex-offenders to become law-abiding citizens. Last year, former Gov. Jay Nixon signed an executive order that would remove questions about a candidate's criminal history from initial job applications for state government. State agencies are still allowed to do criminal background checks later in the process. According to the Missouri Catholic Conference, an estimated one in four adults have an arrest or conviction record that might be a barrier to future employment. Fifteen states and more than 60 cities and counties have adopted fair hiring policies similar to the legislation considered in Missouri. Numerous private companies such as Walmart, Target, Home Depot, Facebook and Xerox have also adopted a ban the box approach. Richardson urges employers to voluntarily agree to ban the box rather than laws targeting private employers. A 2009 study by Harvard and Princeton researchers showed individuals who checked the box reduced their chances of a callback by 50 percent, with blacks hurt twice as much as whites. According to the Missouri Department of Corrections, the unemployment rate for Missourians on parole in 2015 was 44 percent. Miriam Mahan, retired executive director of Sts. Joachim and Ann Care Service in St. Charles who now is a social justice policy advocate there, said her agency removed questions about convictions on applications in 2015. The social service agency continues to administer intensive background checks for all potential employees, but the omission of the "box" prevents biases against the applicant and moves them on to the next phase of the hiring process — what she calls starting from a level playing field. Mahan, a member of Sts. Joachim and Ann Parish, said the position falls in line with Catholic teaching on mercy. She is optimistic that other employers will follow and wants Gov. Eric Greitens to continue the policy set by Nixon. "We embrace those who unfortunately made a mistake, and now we have to give them the ability to self-support," she said. "We complain about recidivism — people come out (of prison) and then they go back. But why do they go back? Because they like being in jail? That is not true. But if they cannot get employment, housing, health care — sooner or later they have to eat." Jeanette Mott Oxford, executive director of Empower Missouri, said diverse groups have come together on the issue because "we know that we're spending too much money on incarceration. The things we've tried to do haven't been working. The number of people in prison in Missouri in the 1980s was around 8,000 and we have 32,000 as of 2016 (Bureau of Justice Statistics). Fair-chance hiring is a very positive kind of policy we can adopt." Richardson points to those numbers as well. "Incarceration is the first response to everything," he said, an expensive option that falls hard on young Americans.  Bookmark/Search this post with Average: Select ratingPoorOkayGoodGreatAwesome No votes yet Tweet Local News ban the box ban the box policies ex-inmates inmates interview Printer-friendly version Send to friend Related Articles Communities come together to help give back to ACTION group Jewel Box volunteers Catholic students' 'Box City' shows plight of the homeless St. Clare of Assisi Parish in Ellisville takes out-of-the-box approach with summer PSR program School looks outside of box for technology funding Most Emailed Stories POPE'S MESSAGE | Peace isn't mass-produced but handcrafted by ordinary people Divine Word priest, a 'true crusader' builds up Downtown parish 'Sluggers' group faithful in commitment to Joplin residents News » All Local Multimedia » Multimedia Slideshows Photo Galleries Reviewcast Education Sports Obituaries STLsisters Special Sections » All Senior Living Christian Hope Jubilarians Nation/World Pope Francis Virtual Vestibule » #GenLifeSTL blog One Church, One Home Heavenly Hoops blog Pop Culture Catholic blog Reviewcast blog The Ambo blog The Newsroom blog Lumen blog Year of Mercy Living Our Faith Church Teaching » All Archbishop's Column Sunday Scripture Dear Father Opinion » All Editorials Viewpoints Letters to the Editor Event/Job postings » Current events Employment Education » Cache Statistics Engage #catholicstl Tweets News and Articles Local News Nation and World News Editorials Living Our Faith Calendar News Archive About the Review General information Advertising Story commenting guidelines Employment Classifieds Staff Subscribe Archdiocese of St. Louis Home Page Online Giving Parishes Schools Quick Links Virtual Vestibule blog Contact the St. Louis Review St. Louis Review 20 Archbishop May Dr. St Louis, MO 63119 314-792-7500 All content copyright © 2017 St. Louis Review.

Mines, Senior Editor, Atlanta Daily World Leave a comment 12 reads A few months after I developed the prototype for my app, I felt ready to begin recruiting customers. So I put together a short list of potential clients in Atlanta that I would’ve liked to offer the app. At the time, I was still working at my day job and waiting until after quitting time would’ve been too late. The next morning, I woke up, watched my morning motivational videos, said my affirmations, and prepared to sell. When lunchtime came, I was ready. I took a deep breath, said to myself: “You got this,” and called the first number. It went something like this: Restaurant: So and So Restaurant, this is Alex speaking, how can I help you? Me: Hi, my name is Isaiah Thompson, I have a mobile app that creates coupons for Bla… Restaurant: Not interested. Thanks. *click* And just like that, it was over. I was a little stunned, but I consider it 30 of the most valuable seconds in my entrepreneurial career. What I learned in that brief interaction will stick with me forever. Earlier that year, I read all the sales books I could get my hands on, from Brian Tracy’s to Zig Ziglar’s. A couple of lessons that each book taught was that “it’s a numbers game” and that “every no gets you closer to a yes.” So, when the first call ended badly, I knew there was something positive to take from it. I was closer to a yes, but there was much more than that. In that 30-second call, I realized I needed fewer, more meaningful words. Also I needed to do a better job of catching my customers when it was convenient for them — convenient enough where they could easily get the message and easily make a decision. You have to do the work for them. Use less words, use more impactful words, and make it so that they don’t have to do the work. So, the next time I called, I lead with the fact that I was proposing a digital coupon that would increase traffic to their business with zero cost up front for the owner. And I got instant responses. It was in a matter of minutes. That is the whole purpose of the coupons themselves. After doing all the research for why people buy things and the psychology of the sale, there are so many barriers to getting a customer to the point of sale. When you factor in cost-saving digital coupons, they lower the barriers and they help guide customers through a sales process, from browsers to shoppers to buyers; again, reducing some of the work on the business owner and upfront costs that would typically be earmarked for marketing and promotion expenses. Customers often say, “I love to ‘shop black,’ but I only have x amount of dollars and Walmart has it cheaper.” We get it. That’s what got me here to this point and inspired me to launch the company. I know they want to be more about our community. They love to shop black, but realistically, it is not convenient, or not as convenient as they would like. But black economics and communities, as conceptualized by visionaries from Marcus Garvey and W.E.B DuBois to Malcolm X, were built on some sort of form of trade. We’ve always developed some sort of way to keep dollars coming in and going out. Whatever we do, to move forward, it has to start economically. Somebody has to keep the lights on. There’s no way we can do anything without getting into the habit of exchanging money and ideas within our community. This is something that we can do together. – By Isaiah Thompson, Founder of Tap App Deals  Also On Atlanta Daily World: comments – Add Yours DIGITAL EDITION × Sign Up Now For The Atlanta Daily World Newsletter!
