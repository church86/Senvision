The health agency says Walmart Canada Corp. has been charged with 174 violations of the province's Public Health Act. "Despite having received this guidance and direction from AHS, both in person and in writing, it is our belief that Walmart reopened selling wildfire-contaminated food to the public," AHS said in a statement Friday. "This was a direct and avoidable risk to the health of this community." Alex Roberton, Walmart Canada's senior director of corporate affairs, said the retailer is surprised by the charges. "Walmart Canada follows very strict policies and procedures specifically designed to ensure the safety of the food we offer our customers," Roberton said in an email. "We, at all material times, and during an unprecedented crisis, worked very closely with both food inspectors and the crisis management team of the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo to reopen the store as soon as reasonably possible in an effort to support and meet the critical needs of the community." He said Walmart cannot comment further because it hasn't received material from the Crown regarding the charges. The huge fire that broke out May 1 forced more than 80,000 people to flee the city. Residents were not allowed to return to the damaged community until June. Some of the charges include failing to dispose of food items, including candy, potato chips, beans and condiments. The health authority said food exposed to wildfires can be damaged by unsafe temperatures, smoke, ash, soot, fire retardants, water and loss of power. AHS said its staff worked closely with food operations after the wildfire to ensure they reopened safely. "Our goal was simple: ensure safe food is available to this community, as one component of returning the community to health, and protecting the community from any further risks."

The health agency says Walmart Canada Corp. has been charged with 174 violations of the province's Public Health Act. "Despite having received this guidance and direction from AHS, both in person and in writing, it is our belief that Walmart reopened selling wildfire-contaminated food to the public," AHS said in a statement Friday. "This was a direct and avoidable risk to the health of this community." Alex Roberton, Walmart Canada's senior director of corporate affairs, said the retailer is surprised by the charges. "Walmart Canada follows very strict policies and procedures specifically designed to ensure the safety of the food we offer our customers," Roberton said in an email. "We, at all material times, and during an unprecedented crisis, worked very closely with both food inspectors and the crisis management team of the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo to reopen the store as soon as reasonably possible in an effort to support and meet the critical needs of the community." He said Walmart cannot comment further because it hasn't received material from the Crown regarding the charges. The huge fire that broke out May 1 forced more than 80,000 people to flee the city. Residents were not allowed to return to the damaged community until June. Some of the charges include failing to dispose of food items, including candy, potato chips, beans and condiments. The health authority said food exposed to wildfires can be damaged by unsafe temperatures, smoke, ash, soot, fire retardants, water and loss of power. AHS said its staff worked closely with food operations after the wildfire to ensure they reopened safely. "Our goal was simple: ensure safe food is available to this community, as one component of returning the community to health, and protecting the community from any further risks."

Scott Bernard Thomas and Roderick Duane Haynes Jr., both 24 and from Leesburg, were indicted Jan. 12 by a grand jury on murder charges. (Lake County Sheriffs Office / Orlando Sentinel) Jason RuiterContact ReporterOrlando Sentinel After a drug deal turned into a robbery and a shooting at a Wal-Mart, two Leesburg men were indicted on murder Privacy Policy Two men accused in a shooting death in an apparent exchange of cash for marijuana outside a Lake County Wal-Mart last year were indicted this week on first-degree murder and armed-robbery charges. Authorities said Scott Bernard Thomas and Roderick Duane Haynes Jr., both 24 and from Leesburg, are responsible for killing Mark Allen Estes, 44, who was shot twice in the parking lot of a Wal-Mart that straddles Leesburg and Fruitland Park off U.S. Highway 441. "Generally, I can tell you that it appears to be a drug deal that turned into a robbery," Assistant State Attorney Rich Buxman said Friday. In reading text messages between the victim and the suspects, investigators said they discovered Estes had been at the Wal-Mart at about 7 p.m. Sept. 19 in a 2011 Cadillac to purchase "fire" — a slang term for marijuana. Video from the department store showed that Estes had been there about 7 p.m. when a 2011 Toyota Camry, that officers said had been stolen in Sumter County several weeks earlier, pulled up next to Estes' vehicle. About a minute later, it pulled out of the parking space, striking another car before driving away, according to arrest reports.

The reward for the Orlando woman's safe return was increased to $1 million, but it expired after a year. She was never found. Estes was lying on the ground, with spent .40-caliber ammunition nearby, the report said. "The victim was inside the Camry when he was shot," Buxman said, and officers found one bullet hole through the front seat and a "partial projectile" in the rear seat. Thomas was arrested several days later and Haynes was arrested in November in Leesburg with the help of U.S. marshals, Buxman said. The mandatory minimum sentence for those convicted of first-degree murder is life imprisonment, he said. jruiter@orlandosentinel.com or 352-742-5927.

The health agency says Walmart Canada Corp. has been charged with 174 violations of the province's Public Health Act. "Despite having received this guidance and direction from AHS, both in person and in writing, it is our belief that Walmart reopened selling wildfire-contaminated food to the public," AHS said in a statement Friday.

"Walmart Canada follows very strict policies and procedures specifically designed to ensure the safety of the food we offer our customers," Roberton said in an email. "We, at all material times, and during an unprecedented crisis, worked very closely with both food inspectors and the crisis management team of the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo to reopen the store as soon as reasonably possible in an effort to support and meet the critical needs of the community." He said Walmart cannot comment further because it hasn't received material from the Crown regarding the charges. The huge fire that broke out May 1 forced more than 80,000 people to flee the city. Residents were not allowed to return to the damaged community until June. Some of the charges include failing to dispose of food items, including candy, potato chips, beans and condiments. The health authority said food exposed to wildfires can be damaged by unsafe temperatures, smoke, ash, soot, fire retardants, water and loss of power. AHS said its staff worked closely with food operations after the wildfire to ensure they reopened safely. "Our goal was simple: ensure safe food is available to this community, as one component of returning the community to health, and protecting the community from any further risks."

The health agency says Walmart Canada Corp. has been charged with 174 violations of the province's Public Health Act. "Despite having received this guidance and direction from AHS, both in person and in writing, it is our belief that Walmart reopened selling wildfire-contaminated food to the public," AHS said in a statement Friday.

He said Walmart cannot comment further because it hasn't received material from the Crown regarding the charges. The huge fire that broke out May 1 forced more than 80,000 people to flee the city. Residents were not allowed to return to the damaged community until June. Some of the charges include failing to dispose of food items, including candy, potato chips, beans and condiments. The health authority said food exposed to wildfires can be damaged by unsafe temperatures, smoke, ash, soot, fire retardants, water and loss of power. AHS said its staff worked closely with food operations after the wildfire to ensure they reopened safely. "Our goal was simple: ensure safe food is available to this community, as one component of returning the community to health, and protecting the community from any further risks."

(David Thurton/ CBC News) Walmart Canada and four of its senior managers face 174 charges under the Public Health Act related to the sale of food contaminated during a wildfire that engulfed Fort McMurray, Alta., last May. A 31-page charge sheet lists the sale of various food items ranging from chocolate bars and nacho chips to pasta, breakfast cereal, bacon and cheese. The charges, filed by Alberta Health Services, state that Walmart Canada failed to ensure that food that had been contaminated or was unfit for human consumption was not stocked or sold at its outlet in downtown Fort McMurray. Four of the charges allege that Walmart lied to public health inspectors by saying it was not selling food that had been contaminated during the fire. Fort McMurray wildfire will leave toxic legacy, experts say Hundreds of undamaged Fort McMurray homes declared unsafe due to toxic ash Fort McMurray wildfire remains out of control after city evacuated Court documents show the alleged violations occurred at the Walmart outlet on Hospital Street between May 24 and May 29, 2016. Prior to allowing residents to re-enter the city, municipal and health officials repeatedly advised residents and businesses to throw out any food products other than those stored safely in cans and tins. "I think the most alarming thing is the actual number of violations," said Keith Warriner, a food safety specialist at the University of Guelph. "It's surprising that such a retailer like Walmart would have been open to these charges, given that they should have been proactive in disposing of the goods." The four people charged are: Darren Kenyon; Sean Kenyon, the Walmart store manager; Michelle Payne, Walmart Canada's senior manager of food safety; and Dale Snowden, the director of disaster and response and recovery for Walmart Stores Inc. Walmart Canada declined an interview request, but in a written statement the senior director of corporate affairs, Alex Robertson, expressed surprise at the charges. "We, at all material times, and during an unprecedented crisis, worked very closely with both food inspectors and the crisis management team of the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo to re-open the store as soon as reasonably possible, in an effort to support and meet the critical needs of the community." Alberta Health Services also declined comment because the matter is now before the courts. 'Direct and avoidable risk' However, AHS spokesman Kerry Williamson issued a statement. In the statement, AHS alleged that Walmart, "despite having received this guidance and direction from AHS, both in person and in writing ... reopened selling wildfire-contaminated food to the public." "This was a direct and avoidable risk to the health of this community." More than 90,000 people in Fort McMurray and surrounding communities were forced from their homes for nearly a month after the fire May 3 wildfire, which destroyed about 2,400 homes and many buildings and left layers of toxic smoke-residue behind. Warriner said if those toxic substances got into food products, it could lead to long-term health consequences. "A lot of them are carcinogenic, so even though they won't affect you immediately they could put you at higher risk of cancer later on, if taken over a course of time." Under the Public Health Act, each offence carries a fine of up to $2,000. "I would imagine the actual fine that will be administered would be for each charge, which I guess they'll fight individually," said Warriner. "But I wouldn't be surprised if it's plus one hundred thousand dollars on this case."

Walmart Shuffles Staff To Take Online Sales Seriously… For Real This Time Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Walmart Shuffles Staff To Take Online Sales Seriously… For Real This Time Image courtesy of Mike Mozart January 13, 2017 5:21 pm EST By Ashlee Kieler@akieler focusing online walmart ecommerce Making Changes executive shifts online sales Despite being the nation’s largest retailer, Walmart still lags behind Amazon and others when it comes to online shopping. The company has spent billions of dollars in just the last year, buying Jet.com and ShoeBuy, so maybe it’s time for Walmart to finally get serious about sorting out e-commerce. Walmart issued an internal memo Friday announcing the departure of one executive and expanded roles for two others in a bid to “become a more customer-centric organization.” As part of the changes, the company will put more focus on integrating physical and online store operations. To that end, it has promoted Jeremy King to executive vice president and U.S. chief technology officer and global platforms. That mouthful of a title means that he will lead the company’s tech organization to bring together physical and commerce technology to create seamless experience for customers. “Whether they shop in-store, through the app, or online,” Marc Lore, president and CEO of Walmart’s commerce division, said in the memo. “The team will work to define and deliver experiences we want” for Walmart. Additionally, Scott Hilton will be promoted to senior vice president and chief revenue officer will be tasked with creating a retail organization “designed from the customer’s point of view.” To do this, the company says it will build on exiting categories like food and consumables, and expand areas like apparel, footwear, home, and other categories. “Our strategy is about offering more choice, competitive prices – particularly on food and consumables – and operating on the strength of the world’s most efficient e-commerce supply chain,” Lore said. The retailer says it will also focus on encouraging and implementing new ideas through its senior vice president of incubation and strategic partnerships, Seth Beal. While the memo obtained by Consumerist did not mention any departures, Recode reports that Michael Bender, the e-commerce division’s chief operating officer, would leave the company. The recent acquisitions of Jet and ShoeBuy indicate that Walmart may finally be digging in for an online battle with Amazon, but the company also has a history of talking a big game about e-commerce only to give up or change direction. In 2013, one former Walmart.com exec confessed that the retailer went through a yearly ritual of starting a “five-year planning exercise, but the plans were never executed and management would say the sales weren’t there to justify the investment capital.” January 13, 2017 By Ashlee Kieler@akieler focusing online walmart ecommerce Making Changes executive shifts online sales Tell a friend: Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window) Click to email (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Related changing pace Walmart Slowing Store Openings, Accelerating Distribution Centers Closing The Price Gap Walmart Might Begin Price-Matching Amazon, Other Online Retailers rival deal days Walmart Crashes Amazon’s Deal-Filled Birthday Party, Announces Its Own Mega Online Sale one way to boost sales Report: Walmart In Talks To Buy Jet.com where's my stuff?

(David Thurton/ CBC News) Walmart Canada and four of its senior managers face 174 charges under the Public Health Act related to the sale of food contaminated during a wildfire that engulfed Fort McMurray, Alta., last May. A 31-page charge sheet lists the sale of various food items ranging from chocolate bars and nacho chips to pasta, breakfast cereal, bacon and cheese. The charges, filed by Alberta Health Services, state that Walmart Canada failed to ensure that food that had been contaminated or was unfit for human consumption was not stocked or sold at its outlet in downtown Fort McMurray. Four of the charges allege that Walmart lied to public health inspectors by saying it was not selling food that had been contaminated during the fire. Fort McMurray wildfire will leave toxic legacy, experts say Hundreds of undamaged Fort McMurray homes declared unsafe due to toxic ash Fort McMurray wildfire remains out of control after city evacuated Court documents show the alleged violations occurred at the Walmart outlet on Hospital Street between May 24 and May 29, 2016. Prior to allowing residents to re-enter the city, municipal and health officials repeatedly advised residents and businesses to throw out any food products other than those stored safely in cans and tins. "I think the most alarming thing is the actual number of violations," said Keith Warriner, a food safety specialist at the University of Guelph. "It's surprising that such a retailer like Walmart would have been open to these charges, given that they should have been proactive in disposing of the goods." The four people charged are: Darren Kenyon; Sean Kenyon, the Walmart store manager; Michelle Payne, Walmart Canada's senior manager of food safety; and Dale Snowden, the director of disaster and response and recovery for Walmart Stores Inc. Walmart Canada declined an interview request, but in a written statement the senior director of corporate affairs, Alex Robertson, expressed surprise at the charges. "We, at all material times, and during an unprecedented crisis, worked very closely with both food inspectors and the crisis management team of the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo to re-open the store as soon as reasonably possible, in an effort to support and meet the critical needs of the community." Alberta Health Services also declined comment because the matter is now before the courts. 'Direct and avoidable risk' However, AHS spokesman Kerry Williamson issued a statement. In the statement, AHS alleged that Walmart, "despite having received this guidance and direction from AHS, both in person and in writing ... reopened selling wildfire-contaminated food to the public." "This was a direct and avoidable risk to the health of this community." More than 90,000 people in Fort McMurray and surrounding communities were forced from their homes for nearly a month after the fire May 3 wildfire, which destroyed about 2,400 homes and many buildings and left layers of toxic smoke-residue behind. Warriner said if those toxic substances got into food products, it could lead to long-term health consequences. "A lot of them are carcinogenic, so even though they won't affect you immediately they could put you at higher risk of cancer later on, if taken over a course of time." Under the Public Health Act, each offence carries a fine of up to $2,000. "I would imagine the actual fine that will be administered would be for each charge, which I guess they'll fight individually," said Warriner. "But I wouldn't be surprised if it's plus one hundred thousand dollars on this case."

A total of 174 counts of Public Health Act violations have been laid against the company, most of them for “failing to ensure that food that has been contaminated or otherwise unfit for human consumption must not be served, offered for sale, processed, packaged, displayed or stored for human consumption.” The list of food items in question includes baby snacks, ice cream, cheese, yogurt, bacon, steaks, frozen fish and a wide variety of snacks, drinks and condiments. Four of the health act charges relate to “obstructing, hindering or interfering” Alberta Health Services inspectors by advising them that contaminated food was no longer being offered for sale. Court documents filed in Fort McMurray show the alleged violations occurred between May 24-29 last year. Four senior Walmart executives, including the U.S.-based director of disaster response and recovery, are included in the health act charges. The northern Alberta oilsands hub was evacuated on May 3 amid a massive wildfire that wiped out about 10 per cent of the community’s structures. A phased re-entry did not proceed until the first week of June though several people, including employees of some grocery and retail stores, came back early to ensure they were stocked with goods for returning evacuees. “We know that having access to safe food is essential to the health and recovery of any community,” AHS said in a statement Friday. “Food exposed to wildfire situations can be damaged by unsafe temperatures, smoke, ash, soot, fire retardant chemicals, water and loss of power during a fire. After the wildfire, we worked closely with food operations across Fort McMurray to support their reopening, safely, without posing further risk to the health of residents, visitors and volunteers. “Despite having received this guidance and direction from AHS, both in person and in writing, it is our belief that Walmart reopened selling wildfire-contaminated food to public.This was a direct and avoidable risk to the health of this community.” Walmart also provided a written statement saying the company was surprised by the charges. “Walmart Canada follows very strict policies and procedures specifically designed to ensure the safety of the food we offer our customers,” said the statement from Alex Roberton, senior director, corporate affairs. “We, at all material times, and during an unprecedented crisis, worked very closely with both food inspectors and the crisis management team of the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo to reopen the store as soon as reasonably possible in an effort to support and meet the critical needs of the community. “We have not yet received Crown Disclosure in relation to these charges, and cannot comment further regarding this ongoing legal matter.” kgerein@postmedia.com twitter.com/keithgerein As Advertised in the Edmonton SUN Walmart charged for allegedly failing to throw out food after Fort McMurray wildfire By Keith Gerein First posted: Friday, January 13, 2017 03:18 PM MST | Updated: Friday, January 13, 2017 03:28 PM MST Walmart Canada has been charged with numerous health violations for allegedly failing to throw out a wide variety of food and drinks from its Fort McMurray store in the weeks following last spring’s wildfire, Postmedia has learned.

Scott Bernard Thomas and Roderick Duane Haynes Jr., both 24 and from Leesburg, were indicted Jan. 12 by a grand jury on murder charges. (Lake County Sheriffs Office / Orlando Sentinel) Jason RuiterContact ReporterOrlando Sentinel After a drug deal turned into a robbery and a shooting at a Wal-Mart, two Leesburg men were indicted on murder Privacy Policy Two men accused in a shooting death in an apparent exchange of cash for marijuana outside a Lake County Wal-Mart last year were indicted this week on first-degree murder and armed-robbery charges. Authorities said Scott Bernard Thomas and Roderick Duane Haynes Jr., both 24 and from Leesburg, are responsible for killing Mark Allen Estes, 44, who was shot twice in the parking lot of a Wal-Mart that straddles Leesburg and Fruitland Park off U.S. Highway 441. "Generally, I can tell you that it appears to be a drug deal that turned into a robbery," Assistant State Attorney Rich Buxman said Friday. In reading text messages between the victim and the suspects, investigators said they discovered Estes had been at the Wal-Mart at about 7 p.m. Sept. 19 in a 2011 Cadillac to purchase "fire" — a slang term for marijuana. Video from the department store showed that Estes had been there about 7 p.m. when a 2011 Toyota Camry, that officers said had been stolen in Sumter County several weeks earlier, pulled up next to Estes' vehicle. About a minute later, it pulled out of the parking space, striking another car before driving away, according to arrest reports.

Technology Wal-Mart Reorganizing E-Commerce Unit As Amazon Pressure Fierce Amazon's growth is taking a toll on rivals, as Wal-Mart reorganizes its e-commerce unit. (Jonathan Weiss/Shutterstock) BRIAN DEAGON 1/13/2017 Reprints With Amazon.com (AMZN) breathing down its neck, Wal-Mart (WMT) has reorganized its e-commerce unit and assigned new executive positions. The changes are meant to make Wal-Mart more "customer-centric," says a report from Bloomberg. Wal-Mart is investing heavily in online operations. It bought e-commerce startup Jet.com for $3.3 billion in September. The founder of Jet.com, Marc Lore, is now CEO of Wal-Mart's e-commerce operation. The company is streamlining its web team so that it can better serve customers when they shop online, via smartphones or in stores, according to a Wal-Mart memo obtained by Bloomberg. Amazon has put increased pressure on Wal-Mart in fields like food and grocery and apparel. And last month, Amazon announced Amazon Go, a high-tech convenience store in Seattle, where Amazon is based. The 1,800-square-foot store is in beta-testing for now; it's slated to open to all in early 2017. Amazon Go takes dead aim at the physical-store world and poses an increasing threat to Wal-Mart and others. Amazon stock rose 0.44% to 817.24 in the stock market today, and it's risen all but one trading day in 2017. Wal-Mart stock fell 1.2% to 67.13. IBD'S TAKE: In addition to its bold e-commerce play, Amazon is leading the market in cloud computing services with other plans to spread its tentacles far and wide. The threat of Amazon is putting the squeeze on Wal-Mart and other big retailers such as Macy's (M), Kohl's (KSS) and Sears (SHLD), and the company looks to be getting larger. On Thursday, Amazon said it would boost its full-time U.S.-based workforce by 100,000, aiming to reach 280,000 jobs by mid-2018. Amazon employed 30,000 in 2011. Amazon said many of the new jobs will be in fulfillment centers that have been announced over the past several months and are currently under construction in Texas, California, Florida, New Jersey and other states. Amazon delivered more than 2 billion packages for independent merchants in 2016, more than double its 2015 tally. But a report by Pacific Crest Securities says the new hires could also be part of Amazon's push to accelerate efforts to build physical stores. "Amazon will also add nonfulfillment center jobs, but we think that still leaves a significant and unexplained gap," the Pacific Crest report said. "We believe that this could be explained by an accelerated rollout of physical stores. In particular, we think that a potential grocery pickup concept looks particularly promising." Already this year, Macy's has detailed plans to shutter 68 stores and cut more than 10,000 jobs. It plans to close a total of 100 locations. Macy's and Kohl's both slashed holiday-quarter earnings estimates after their same-store sales for November-December fell 2.1%. Sears said it would close another 150 Sears and Kmart stores. The Limited said it would close all 250 of its stores, and ax 4,000 jobs, as it moves its entire operation online.

Jeremy King, who was the chief technology officer of global ecommerce for Wal-Mart Stores, will oversee the technology teams for both its brick and mortar retail stores and its ecommerce business, which includes Walmart.com and Jet.com, the memo said. Tony Rogers, the chief marketing officer of Wal-Mart in the United States, will now also oversee online marketing efforts as the company shifts its focus to building its websites and ecommerce offerings, the memo from Marc Lore, chief executive of Wal-Mart's U.S. e-commerce business, said on Friday. Wal-Mart said GE Power executive Clay Johnson will replace Karenann Terrell as chief information officer. Terrell, who has been in the post since 2012, will leave in February. The moves come a few days after reports emerged that Wal-Mart would be cutting hundreds of jobs by the end of the month.

(Steven Senne/AP) BY Victoria Cavaliere NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Updated: Friday, January 13, 2017, 3:10 PM The country’s biggest retail chain might get hit where it hurts on Black Friday. Walmart employees protesting low wages and skyrocketing insurance premiums are planning a wave of protests across the country through next week’s unofficial shopping holiday. Organizers say a thousand store protests are planned in Los Angeles, Chicago, Dallas, Miami, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Minnesota and dozens of other places. “With so many Americans struggling to make ends meet and Walmart taking in $16 billion in profits and compensating its executives $10 million each, workers and community leaders have been calling on Walmart and Chairman Rob Walton to address the wage gap the company is creating,” a press release said. Workers have already started walking off the job at stores and warehouses in California and Seattle, according to the union-backed employee group Walmart Workers for Change. “No matter how hard we work, my husband and I can’t catch up on our bills,” said Charlene Fletcher, a Walmart employee and union leader in Duarte, Calif. RELATED: HOSTESS TO CLOSE, CITES NATIONWIDE WORKERS STRIKE Fletcher said her husband also works for the retailer, and both have been subjected to poor scheduling, low pay and what she described as the company’s “disregard” for its employees. Walmart workers will also endure a 36% increase in insurance premiums starting next year, a spike that minimum wage or hourly workers can’t afford, the workers’ group said. Walmart told the Daily News the protests are "another exaggerated publicity campaign aimed at generating headlines to mislead our customers and associates." The Arkansas-based company, which employees 1.4 million people, also said it "has some of the best jobs in the retail industry." "Our wages and benefits typically meet or exceed those at a majority of our competitors, including those that are unionized," spokesman Dan Fogleman said. The company is also one of the biggest Black Friday competitors, and it plans to open its doors at 8 p.m. on Thanksgiving Day. Workers say they were not given a choice about being scheduled the night of the holiday. But working holidays is not unusual, according to Steven Restivo, Senior Director of Community Affairs for Walmart.  "Most of our stores are open 24 hours and, historically, much of our Black Friday preparations have been done on Thanksgiving," he said. vcavaliere@nydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation: facebook Tweet Get Daily News stories, delivered to your inbox.

Since Wal-Mart completed its acquisition of Jet.com in September, the e-commerce site's founder Marc Lore has been studying his new parent company's business and he's shaking it up with the blessing of the retailer's CEO. Wal-Mart said it is realigning leadership to better match how customers are shopping today — not just at its stores but on its main website and Jet.com. Two memos sent to employees Friday from Lore, president & CEO Walmart eCommerce U.S., and Doug McMillon, Wal-Mart's president and CEO, explain changes that blend leadership for stores and online. In McMillon's memo, he said, "we need more speed and less bureaucracy" to better serve shoppers to save them money and time. He added, some elimination of positions is part of the effort "to stay lean and fast" but in other cases, new positions will be created. On Tuesday, people close to the matter told CNBC hundreds of headquarters' jobs would be eliminated before the end of January, many in human resources. The following day, tech company Workday said the retailer had purchases a subscription to its human resources platform. The strategy is seemingly a continuation of its decision last year to combine corporate IT personnel at its Arkansas headquarters with its e-commerce team in Silicon Valley. When traditional brick-and-mortar retailers began launching websites years ago, leadership teams were often separate. But as the world has changed and many consumers shop both online and in-store, more retailers are moving to integrate teams from two separate operational divisions, to one. While it sounds like a simple concept, it can be difficult to execute. Some argue it's necessary integration pain, and Wal-Mart is later to the game than other retailers. New responsibilities show chapters Stupid acquisition award for WMT/Jet.com: Cohen    Wednesday, 17 Aug 2016 | 10:04 AM ET | 03:58 Lore's team will work with Wal-Mart U.S. CEO Greg Foran and is a combination of individuals from Wal-Mart and Jet.com. Liza Landsman was promoted to president of Jet.com from her prior position as chief customer officer. Scott Hilton was promoted from chief revenue officer at Jet.com, to senior vice president and chief revenue officer overseeing Wal-Mart's owned merchandise selling, its marketplace sellers and digital store operations across Walmart.com, Jet.com and Hayneedle.com Jeremy King was tapped to be executive vice president and U.S. chief technology officer and global platforms. King, who will lead U.S. technology, in-stores and online., was previously chief technology officer for Wal-Mart global eCommerce. Jordan Sweetnam is now the retailer's vice president of customer experience, product, focusing on products, shoppers, and faster execution across the board for the retailer. Sweetnam was formerly the vice president of global product for Walmart eCommerce. Seth Beal is assuming a new role as senior vice president, incubation and strategic partnerships, leading a team that works on identifying new technologies and ideas to better serve Walmart customers. Beal previously was SVP, global marketplace and digital store operations for Walmart eCommerce. Tony Rogers, Walmart U.S. chief marketing officer, will now lead marketing over Walmart's stores, Walmart.com and Jet.com. Nate Faust, co-founder and formerly COO at Jet.com, is now taking on the role of senior vice president for U.S. eCommerce and supply chain for Walmart U.S., overseeing logistics and supply chain for the organization in the U.S. for both stores and online. Departures Neil Ashe, who has been the head of Wal-Mart's global e-commerce efforts will be leaving the company on Jan. 31. It was previously announced that he would depart. Michael Bender, Walmart global eCommerce chief operating officer is also leaving the company. Last week, Walmart said Sam's Club CEO Rosalind Brewer was retiring and John Furner was stepping up to take over. Karenann Terrell will depart her role as chief information officer on Feb. 24. New hire, new division Clay Johnson joins Wal-Mart for a newly created role of enterprise chief information officer, reporting to CFO Brett Biggs. Johnson will focus on lowering costs, leveraging the retailer's scale, cybersecurity and the associate experience. Wal-Mart is creating a new division that focuses on improving customer care, better managing returns and fraud prevention.

Daniel Snyder, 31, of Second Street was arrested after an incident that occurred at 2:20 a.m. Dec. 18. Police responded to Walmart for a report of a man in the store attempting to shoplift. Officers met with Snyder in the hardware section of the store and he agreed to follow them to the store’s office. Once inside, the officers patted down Snyder and found a handgun in the waistband of his pants which Snyder did not have a license to carry. Officers said the weapon contained a magazine with seven .45-caliber rounds, and one in the chamber. Another magazine with seven rounds was found in a holster. After discovering the weapon, police searched Snyder and found baggies with what they believed to be heroin and methamphetamine. Police transported Snyder to Mahoning Township Police Department. They searched a bag which had been taken from the vehicle which Snyder arrived in, and found brass knuckles, knives and ammunition for the weapon. Police said they also found a flare gun, pepper spray and suspected acid. Snyder has been charged with illegal possession of a firearm, a felony, as well as misdemeanor drug and retail theft charges. A preliminary hearing was held Jan. 11 before Senior Judge Edward M. Lewis, and all charges were bound for court. Snyder is still locked up in lieu of $50,000 bail.

(Economic Times) the brief United StatesIndia The case for local, mom & pop grocers over Walmart By Vasundhara Jolly January 14, 2017 1:29 AM (UTC+8) Share Tweet Linkedin Print Email Share 0 Comment 0 Asia Times is not responsible for the opinions, facts or any media content presented by contributors. In case of abuse, click here to report. The first time I traveled to the United States was in the year 2004. A usually curious and eager thirteen-year old, I was a little surprised when my grand-aunt who lived in Rochester, New York, suggested we take a late night visit to the supermarket as she wanted to buy some vegetables. That visit was a revelation for various reasons. Firstly, she expected fresh vegetables in the middle of the night. My mother in New Delhi awoke at 5.30am two to three times a week to score the freshest vegetables and fruits at our local grocer’s. Secondly, she assumed a supermarket visit would be comparable to a visit to a historical sight. To describe the local grocer where my mother shopped (and my grandmother before her), as a hut would be a stretch. Even though this might sound like a cliché, I promise you it cannot be repeated enough: for someone who has never seen one before, the American supermarket is nothing short of a marvel. And for a thirteen-year old, to look at rows and rows of perfectly ripe and shiny fruit in which one can see their reflection, can be a metaphor for what possibilities the future can hold. The DailyBrief Must-reads from across Asia - directly to your inbox The industrialization of our food, and the increasing disconnect with where it comes from, has led us to normalize the concept of these Franken-supermarkets. Thomas Reardon, a professor at Michigan State University, succinctly argues that the influx of foreign direct investment, and the technological advancements in retail procurement technology and inventory management are phenomena that must be embraced by the emerging markets of Latin America, Africa, and Asia. Global retail multinationals such as the Carrefours and the Walmarts, with their access to liquid funds, international credit and their use of the aforementioned systems, are driving the produce retail markets, and hence, should be the cornerstone of development policies in lower income countries. Walmart’s first foray into the Indian market, which is saturated with local players, was a disaster. While its official entry required a joint partnership with Bharti Enterprises, a giant business house with its feet in everything from telecom to education, it was also met with widespread protests from concerned citizens. The entry of a deep-pocketed retail giant would wreak havoc on the largely informal and local agriculture supply systems which had developed their own systems over time. Despite an admission of guilt to a $25 million lobbying charge, their 20 odd stores (a small number for a potential market of a billion people) which were set up in tier-2 cities under the pseudonym of “Easy Day”, continued to function but failed to gain the patronage of the consumers. Conversely, Walmart in the US is one of the largest suppliers of organic produce now, hoping to catch on to growing trends in consumption. The supply-chain of this industry in India is largely informal. A nexus of smallholder farmers and middlemen, which make up an estimated 50 million small traders are involved in the farm-to-store agriculture business across India. This informal network ensures the produce reaches mom and pop grocers (or kirana stores). The kind of farmers Walmart is looking for are large-scale commercial farmers, which make up a small section of India’s agrarian economy. If agriculture and food were solely dependent on economic efficiencies, the story might be different. It is political: under a Congress-led government, Walmart’s market experiment shriveled. In BJP’s Modi government, big business has an ardent supporter. His policies, which have focused greatly on bringing in FDI, retail giants like Walmart can likely see a renewed boost.  Agriculture is also culture: Punjab, one of the highest agricultural productivity states in India, celebrates the harvest festival of Lohri with much gusto, signifying the end of the winter solstice and the beginning of the rabi cropping season. Conscious (albeit price-insensitive) consumers in the liberal oases of the Eastern coast of the United States now prefer to shop organic produce at local stores, choosing to vote with their dollar for smaller stores that share their values (such as Trader Joe’s or Whole Foods), or farmer’s markets for urban spaces that can afford them. But cities of the developing world have always relied greatly on their trusted and local networks of local mom and pop stores to supply their daily food requirements. For long-time customers, these stores even provide short-term credit. It seems counter-intuitive then, to push for multinational retailers to put small suppliers out of business in developing countries, if the arc of the food supply system is ultimately bent towards the smaller, values, and relationships focused retail process. Embed from Getty Images The day my grandfather passed away in New Delhi, I was immediately dispatched by my mother to Mr. Garg’s kirana store, to buy supplies we would need for the memorial services, and to feed the stream of visiting relatives and friends. Upon receiving a distraught third-generation customer, Mr. Garg immediately collected all the things he knew our house to usually order. Once he heard the news, he refused to take any money from me. He didn’t have any shiny fruit I could see my reflection in, but he was connected to my family in the way food is always meant to be. The nature of how humans engage with food stands at odds with the values of industrial, and mass retail systems; food is personal, cultural, and the basis of our human connection.

(Photo: Walmart) Greenpeace and other organizations urge Walmart to offer 'ethical and sustainable' tuna UNITED STATES Saturday, January 14, 2017, 00:10 (GMT + 9) Greenpeace and other environmental organizations, trade unions and human rights and labour condition organizations have urged Walmart, through a joint letter, to take responsibility for ensuring that its supply chain of fishery products is free from abusive labour practices and illegal fishing. In 2015, Greenpeace launched a global campaign to reform the "out of control" tuna industry. From the beginning, major U.S. and international unions stood with the organization in solidarity, calling on tuna giant Thai Union to commit to sustainable and ethical sourcing across its global supply chains. The aim of the letter is to ensure sustainable and ethical supply chains for all tuna products sold in stores, starting with Walmart’s Great Value brand. Walmart, which is responsible for one quarter of U.S. canned tuna sales, buys tuna from Thai Union Group, a company that has been under the spotlight for its links to human rights and labour abuse, including forced labour and human trafficking, in some of its seafood supply chains. The supermarket chain has also been involved in supply chain scandals not providing sufficient assurances that its supply chains are socially responsible, the letter points out. Greenpeace claims that irresponsible labour practices and illegal, destructive fishing are interconnected, and states that under its Corporate Social Responsibility commitments, Walmart has the responsibility to provide its millions of customers with sustainable and ethical fishery products. While the retail giant already provides its customers with a more sustainable tuna option (Ocean Naturals), the signatories of the letter say this is not enough when it comes to addressing the chronic human rights and environmental horrors associated with the majority of its tuna offerings, and what is needed to transform a brutal and lawless industry. The letter ends urging the company to lead the U.S., Canadian, and international retail sectors to make that iconic seafood staple a more responsible one.   [email protected] www.fis.com  Print MORE NEWS Canada Jan 14, 02:00 (GMT + 9): New Brunswick processor forced into liquidation Mexico Jan 14, 01:50 (GMT + 9): Legislators urge government to promote consumption and production of tilapia Mexico Jan 14, 01:10 (GMT + 9): CIAD launches squid sausages United States Jan 14, 00:10 (GMT + 9): Greenpeace and other organizations urge Walmart to offer 'ethical and sustainable' tuna Peru Jan 13, 23:30 (GMT + 9): Pesquera Diamante expects to double fishmeal production Australia Jan 13, 23:10 (GMT + 9): Origin of shrimp disease is still unknown United Kingdom Jan 13, 23:00 (GMT + 9): IN BRIEF - Losses double for Dawnfresh United Kingdom Jan 13, 22:10 (GMT + 9): SWFPA supports new deep water trawling regulation United States Jan 13, 22:00 (GMT + 9): IN BRIEF - When aquaculture grows, so does its economic impact / Report Philippines Jan 13, 22:00 (GMT + 9): IN BRIEF - American nationals visit Pangasinan to train on Asian aquaculture Ghana Jan 13, 22:00 (GMT + 9): IN BRIEF - Elizabeth Quaye nominated for Ministry of Fisheries & Aquaculture Australia Jan 13, 22:00 (GMT + 9): IN BRIEF - Alien-looking shrimp of the desert appear in Central Australia after flooding rains Australia Jan 13, 21:50 (GMT + 9): Food supplier sues Huon for lack of payment Chile Jan 13, 21:20 (GMT + 9): Salmon companies to pay about USD 14 million in aquaculture patents this year Spain Jan 13, 01:40 (GMT + 9): Canned tuna should be a 'sensitive product' in non-EU agreements, claims Anfaco Lenguaje FEATURED EVENTS    TOP STORIES Canned tuna should be a 'sensitive product' in non-EU agreements, claims Anfaco Spain The current situation of the industrial sector of transforming fishery and aquaculture products of Galicia, its future prospects, and its main problems were the main aspects raised to the Galician Government by a delegation of Anfaco-Cecopesca’s board of directors.

Pre-orders have opened for the new console, and Nintendo has officially released all of the important details as of January 12. Officially releasing to the public on March 3, the Switch could easily become another target of scalpers, much like the NES Classic Edition did. You still can’t buy a new one online for less than $100, and Nintendo hasn’t made enough supply to meet the demand. Nintendo is planning to release a limited number of pre-orders directly at its New York City Nintendo World location, and it’s unknown if that limited production will be reflected elsewhere. At $299.99, the hybrid console is a more hefty dent in your wallet than the actual retail price of the NES Classic Edition. Good luck finding the latter at $60, though, since scalpers already control the market on those. The NES Classic Edition’s market has been controlled by scalpers since it was announced. [Image by Nintendo] Best Buy, Walmart, Target, and GameStop have all begun accepting pre-orders, and it doesn’t appear that the scalpers are about to ruin anything this time. The only high-cost price tags are for the console with extras like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, 1-2 Switch, Has Been Heroes, and a Clean and Protect Kit. The Ultimate Bundle also comes with Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, Redout, Binding of Isaac: Afterbirth, and Just Dance 2017 at $637.99. Walmart appears to have the actual best buy, offering the Nintendo Switch console and Joy-Con controllers with no extras at $299.96. At merely three pennies off, it’s really up to you where you prefer to pre-order the console. Remember that Walmart’s least expensive deal doesn’t come with any games, and you’ll have to buy them on the side. The positive side of that is that you can choose which game or games you want if you don’t really want the ones which come with GameStop’s $437.99 or higher bundles. Amazon has had a listing for the game The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild on Wii U with a March 31 release date, so it’s unclear if the bundles are the only way you can get it before that date. They haven’t started accepting pre-orders for the Switch yet unless the scalpers have already bought them all on Amazon. It appears that Nintendo is following the same path as Sony and Microsoft this time, locking multiplayer behind a paywall. Their paid online subscription service, as revealed by The Verge, hasn’t had many details released surrounding it. Only Nintendo knows at this point if possible apps like Netflix or YouTube will be locked behind the paywall as well, which goes into effect this Fall. This means the service will be free until then, and then there will only be a free trial for latecomers. Much like Xbox Games with Gold and PS Plus, Nintendo is adding the incentive of one classic NES or SNES game download every month, though GameSpot reports that you won’t be able to keep the free games for more than a month. It also means that one of the primary features of Pokemon titles (multiplayer battles) will require you to pay Nintendo monthly. ‘Pokemon’ has been rumored for the Nintendo Switch, but there are no confirmations yet. [Image by Tomohiro Ohsumi/Getty Images] Of course, this depends on Nintendo releasing a Pokemon title on the console, which GameStop allegedly leaked. This has not been confirmed, and the page has been taken down, according to Forbes As for mobile gaming, one of the biggest concerns most people would have is how to charge the Nintendo Switch. The company Shigeru Miyamoto built has given it the standard Micro-USB port, which is the same port used in most mobile devices like smartphones. It’s sold separately, but the cables are rather inexpensive. It’s highly likely that Nintendo has built in a lock-out with the software to prevent transferring free games through this port from a laptop. Nintendo has always been vigilant about piracy, taking proprietary media routes to ensure their games can’t be copied easily. Nintendo has been adamant about copyright and piracy, even taking the battle to YouTube. [Image by Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images] The screen will be full 720p resolution, which is about standard for most games released on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, as well as the initial versions of Xbox One and PS4. This is fine for smaller screens like the Nintendo Switch but could be jarring if you plan on playing it on your 60-inch 4K TV. The 32 GB of storage space will be a hindrance to bigger games, though, so AAA open-world titles would have to be “dumbed down” to work on the Switch. Of course, Nintendo seems to be remedying that with Super Mario Odyssey. Good news for fans of Nintendo’s Japanese titles is that the Switch will not be region-locked. If the game is made for Switch, you can play a Japanese title on a console sold in Australia, for example. Now, the big question is whether you want to wait and buy a Nintendo Switch later, or secure yours today from Walmart, Best Buy, Target, or GameStop.

(NYSE: WMT) supercenter or Barry’s Bike Shop, chances are your first impression will have a significant role in a decision to buy something. If you came in to buy a certain item, maybe you’ll end up buying something else as well — or a more expensive (and higher profit) item instead. If you feel like a fly trapped in a spider’s web, the feeling is not unwarranted. Even before you walk in, the store’s “curb appeal” is working on you. Signage colors, window displays and an appealing entryway that is clean and uncluttered affect your willingness to spend time and money at this particular store. Smart retailers know all this and do their best to deliver the appearance of a store worth your patronage. Analyzing shopper behavior is a growth industry, whether the shopping is done online or in a brick-and-mortar store. Online shopping has built-in data collection methods that can provide the seller with a blizzard of data on what shoppers are doing on a website and what they are buying or not buying. Brick-and-mortar retail does not have the same advantage, but it has been around long enough that virtually every retailer implements a few tricks to help separate shoppers from their money. The following map shows a typical floor plan for a Wal-Mart U.S. supercenter. It is not the only floor layout the company uses, either in the United States or in foreign countries. Source: 24/7 Wall St.Here are some tactics Wal-Mart and other successful retailers use to entice shoppers or persuade them to buy more. Impulse areas. Typically at the cash registers and, also typically, stuffed with candy and other treats that shoppers can buy as a reward for a shopping job well done. Or to quiet demanding children. Store-in-a-store. This may not actually mean a branded store-within-a-store but a portion of the floor space that has been decorated differently to make it stand out. Special lighting along with wood floors and shelving send an upscale message and consumers will pay more to be part of that message. Wal-Mart’s latest upgrades to its electronics section are an example. Endcaps. The ends of long rows of shelving (called gondolas) were originally used to promote special pricing offers. By adding signage that made the endcaps look like discounted offers, retailers can now place full-price items on these endcaps and expect to see higher sales. Eye (and buy) level. Most shoppers don’t want to bend down to examine an item nor do they want to have to reach way over their heads to get something. The items that stores promote the most are somewhere between eye level and waist level. Brands often compensate supermarkets with placement fees for these most favored positions. Traffic builders. Putting everyday items like milk and bread all the way at the back of the store exposes shoppers to more potential purchases. It also tends to make them mad. It’s a trade-off. Action Alley. This is the power aisle, the most central area of the store and one where it is typical to see one-off promotions or seasonal items. The impression on shoppers is that more good deals await as they get deeper into the store. Front of store. In a Wal-Mart supercenter this is typically the location for the customer service desk along with a restaurant, a vision-care center and maybe a local shop or two that rent space from the store. The idea is to give shoppers a feeling of a small-shop downtown shopping district. Signpost brands. These are the nationally advertised brands that virtually everyone at least knows if not uses. Campbell’s soups, Coca-Cola, Heinz ketchup — all these indicate to shoppers what else they’ll find on nearby shelves. Shoppers also expect to find store-brands that cost less right next to the big brands. Overall environment. Primarily this means the overall look of the store and clearly identifying sale items and locations. Wal-Mart has been remarkably consistent with its “rollback” and other pricing signage. Shoppers looking for bargains know by now just exactly what to look for. Product range. A typical supermarket stocks about 80,000 products. A typical household uses about 300 products. A typical Wal-Mart supercenter stocks more than 142,000 different items. Do shoppers really need to be able to choose between 10 brands of bottled water? Encouraging shopper traffic to move to the store’s best advantage. Most shoppers travel around the perimeter of a store, and counter-clockwise movement is the way most shoppers prefer to traverse through a store. Research done in 2008 shows that shoppers who move counter-clockwise spend on average $2 more per trip to the supermarket. That’s not a lot, but then retail is not exactly a high-margin business and every extra dollar is welcome. Using color and smells to create an impression. It’s no accident that Wal-Mart puts its bakery at the front of the store. The smell of freshly baking bread is warm and inviting. Similarly, a display of fresh vegetables in all their glorious colors implies a healthy and fresh environment. Making it hard to find things. If shoppers cannot easily locate the item they came into the store to buy, they typically begin to look at other items they had no intention of buying and occasionally that turns into a sale. A Wal-Mart supercenter is so large that the store doesn’t even really have to try very hard to do this.

A Springfield man was captured by police Wednesday after allegedly being captured on video stealing a security camera from Walmart. Ruben Santiago, 24, pleaded not guilty Thursday in Springfield District Court to larceny over $250 following his arrest Wednesday afternoon. Santiago and another man were spotted just before noon entering Walmart on Boston Road and walking to the electronics department. There, Santiago picked up a $379 Night Owl Video Security DVR/Camera system while the accomplice grabbed a Nest Net Cam valued at $199, according to the arrest report. Reuben Santiago, 24, of Springfield(Springfield Police Department)  The suspects then headed for the grocery department and ducked out an emergency exit, the report said. Police chased the pair down Contessa Street, eventually arresting Santiago after finding him hiding under a porch. The other suspect got away, the report said. Assistant District Attorney Jill O'Connor requested $5,000 bail on the new charge, and asked for Santiago's bail to be revoked in an open cocaine distribution case. Defense lawyer Erin O'Connor opposed revoking her client's release in the drug case. She asked Judge William Boyle to set bail at $500 in the new case and require Santiago to wear a GPS monitoring bracelet. Santiago has overcome struggles with substance abuse and is enrolled in Roca, a highly regarded anti-recidivism program operating in Springfield, Erin O'Connor said. Boyle asked Santiago if he wanted to take a drug test and said he would receive "every consideration" if he passed. Santiago huddled with his lawyer for nearly a minute. "Your honor, he would not like to take a drug test today," Erin O'Connor said. "Even if he's in the Roca program?" the judge asked. Boyle set bail at $5,000 and revoked the defendant's release in the drug case. Santiago is due back in court on Jan. 30.

Although the device was not so successful in grabbing popularity compared to the Lumia 520, the company continued to manufacture it. Now, Lumia 435 is available at Walmart for just $29. Lumia 435 was spotted at Walmart with a huge discount. This could be the best thing today for those who are fans of the Windows phone. The giant retailer is now offering the unlocked Lumia 435 for just $28.75 which means you can save $18.98 on the device. This is a good deal for Lumia lovers. Lumia 435 Discount spotted in Walmart At the launch, the entry-level smartphone was sold originally for $80. However, after a couple of months, the price of the handset went down to just $50 permanently. Previously, the giant retailer offered the device at $47.73. Now, the buyers can own the device at just $29. You can grab the device at this price for a limited time only.

REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon/File Photo (Copyright Reuters 2016) Amazon.com Inc. on Thursday said it plans to create more than 100,000 full-time jobs in the U.S. within the next 18 months, leveraging plans already in the works in part to patch up its contentious relationship with President-elect Donald Trump.  Continue Reading Below The additional jobs would swell Amazon's U.S. workforce to 280,000, compared with 30,000 in 2011. However, the online retail giant's rapid growth has kneecapped traditional retailers including Macy's Inc. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc., which have been cutting jobs by the thousands.  Amazon said many of the new positions will be at already-announced warehouses under construction in Texas, California, Florida and New Jersey. Others will be in areas such as cloud technology, machine learning and advanced logistics -- some of which eliminate jobs, experts say.  "Innovation is one of our guiding principles at Amazon, and it's created hundreds of thousands of American jobs," said Amazon Chief Executive Jeff Bezos.  A spokesman for Mr. Trump seemed to credit the president-elect with Amazon's hiring bump because he had urged the tech industry to keep jobs and production inside the U.S., at a meeting with heads of tech companies last month. "The President-elect was pleased to have played a role in that decision by Amazon," the spokesman said.  Amazon's announcement highlights a new reality for companies as Mr. Trump prepares to take office: His public praising or shaming of corporations for their business decisions is pressuring them to stay in his good graces and to adjust their public-relations strategies.  Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT During the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump made job creation a central message and blasted companies, including technology giants, for purportedly sending jobs overseas. Since his election, companies across a range of industries have scurried to announce plans to retain or add U.S. jobs.  Some, such as Carrier Corp. and Ford Motor Co., reversed existing initiatives to shift manufacturing abroad. Others trumpeted efforts that had been under way before November. In December, SoftBank Group Corp. Chief Executive Masayoshi Son met with Mr. Trump to say he would invest $50 billion in the U.S. and create 50,000 jobs -- money that would come from a fund he announced in October.  A few companies have held firm in the face of Mr. Trump's scolding, such as General Motors Co., which plans to import some cars from Mexico to sell in the U.S.  Jack Ma, chief executive of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., a Chinese competitor to Amazon, met with Mr. Trump on Monday and made a bold, if vague, promise to create new U.S. jobs by encouraging American sellers to sell to Chinese consumers.  In an echo of Mr. Ma's proposal, Amazon said additional jobs could be created indirectly for small sellers who offer their goods on Amazon's marketplace.  Rosy talk about jobs from companies doesn't mean they are truly shifting when or whether they bring on new workers, said Peter Cappelli, a management professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School.  "What [companies] are going to do first is spin," he said. That approach is "just a whole lot easier to do than to actually change your real numbers," he added.  Companies are hedging against Mr. Trump's threats to punish businesses that move American jobs elsewhere, Prof. Cappelli said, and corporate leaders are concerned about potential policy changes.  During the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump's relationship with the tech industry was strained. Tech leaders overwhelmingly supported Hillary Clinton, and Mr. Trump lambasted companies including Apple Inc. and International Business Machines Corp.  The acrimony between Mr. Trump and Mr. Bezos was particularly charged. Mr. Trump accused Amazon's CEO of buying the Washington Post to influence politics. "If I become president, oh do they have problems," Mr. Trump said. He called Amazon a "no profit company" in a tweet in December 2015. (Amazon had a profit of $482 million in the last quarter of 2015.)  That same month, Mr. Bezos, who also runs closely held rocket-making company Blue Origin LLC, said he would reserve a seat on one of his rockets for Mr. Trump. "#sendDonaldtospace," a message from Mr. Bezos' Twitter account read. Weeks before the election, Mr. Bezos said that the candidate's behavior "erodes democracy around the edges."  Amazon's share price was one of the hardest hit among tech firms in the days after Mr. Trump's election, tumbling 9% to as low as about $719 before recovering.  Analysts were skeptical that Amazon's announcement Thursday reflected an acceleration of its hiring plans. "There may be some 'political capital' involved with the timing and details," said Colin Sebastian. an analyst at Robert W. Baird & Co. He said he expects Amazon's international and domestic employment both to increase.  Amazon's biggest source of jobs is its warehouses, which process and ship orders. Amazon opened about two dozen new warehouses in the third quarter of 2016, prompting costs to soar in part due to those investments, the company said. That brought its total number of warehouses globally to about 150.  Before the announcement Thursday, Amazon had been planning to open some 16 new fulfillment centers over the next few months, which would have created more than 15,000 jobs, according to data from supply-chain consultancy MWPVL International Inc. Marc Wulfraat, president of MWPVL, estimates another 20 warehouses could be announced this year, employing anywhere from approximately 300 to 6,000 people each.  To reach the 100,000 mark, Amazon is likely to convert some part-time jobs to full-time, Mr. Wulfraat said. There are also seasonal workers to pick from: Amazon said it hired 120,000 holiday workers in the U.S. in 2016, and thousands of them will stay on as the company continues to expand. "If you look at the growth curve, I think it's going to continue to be as strong as last year," Mr. Wulfraat added.  The rapid growth of Amazon and e-commerce in general has cost traditional retailers thousands of brick-and-mortar jobs. Wal-Mart plans to cut nearly 1,000 corporate positions before the end of January, according to a person familiar with the situation, after cutting about 7,000 back office store jobs last year. Last week, Macy's said it would slash more than 10,000 jobs and close dozens of stores.  Oliver Chen, a Cowen & Co. analyst, said online retail growth rates have been running as high as 25%, while in-store foot traffic can run down 6% or more. "The organizations are having to respond to the way in which consumers are changing their shopping habits," he said. "The penetration rate online is continuing to grow, and that means less need for physical stores."  Mr. Trump and Silicon Valley executives struck a conciliatory tone in part just by showing up at their meeting last month. During the 90-minute summit, Mr. Trump told the 13 executives, including Mr. Bezos, that he would work with them to foster innovation and to support fair-trade deals. The group also discussed job creation.  Mr. Bezos said in a statement at the time that Mr. Trump's promised focus on innovation "would create a huge number of jobs across the whole country, in all sectors, not just tech -- agriculture, infrastructure, manufacturing -- everywhere."

It was two months before his family reported him missing. In October, a tipster called Crime Stoppers to report skeletal remains in a wooded area at the interchange of I-465 and South East Street, two-and-a-half miles from the Walmart. “Whoever called in the tip obviously saw the remains,” said IMPD Detective Bob Flack, who climbed sixty feet into the woods from the off ramp to look at the body. “It was pretty much a full skeleton, there were a couple of bones missing. “There was clothing left with the remains and we found the wallet and the work ID of the individual that was later identified.” Flack told IMPD Missing Persons detectives he had the ID card of a man they were looking for, but without a coroner’s ruling on the identity and cause of death, there was no proof that Capps’ death was a murder. Joseph Capps Until this week. “Two days ago I was notified by the coroner’s office,” said Flack. “We checked the name on the work ID and determined that individual’s dentist and found that person had seen a dentist and that’s how we made the identification of that individual.” Even though it took more than two months to attach a name to the body in the woods, Flack said investigators knew from the start they likely had a murder to solve. “They did an autopsy the next day and that’s when a defect was found on the skull of the individual,” said the detective. “There was blunt force trauma to the skull on the right side of the head.” There was no activity on Capps’ bank card or cell phone following his disappearance. Capps didn’t have a criminal record or evidence of drug use or a dispute with anyone. The location where the body was found is so inaccessible that Flack wonders if his original Crimestoppers tipster literally stumbled on the remains while hiking through the woods or knows why Capps was killed and dumped there. That informant has called Crimestoppers once before. Investigators hope the tipster will again at 317-262-TIPS. While Capps was murdered in 2016, his identification and cause of death were not determined until days ago and the homicide will be listed against 2017 statistics.

Bloomberg For years, Amazon.com has targeted shoppers who can afford a $99 Prime subscription. Last week’s announcement that it will deliver groceries to food-stamp recipients shows Amazon also wants to appeal to lower-income shoppers, traditionally Wal-Mart’s bailiwick. Amazon is authorized to start the experiment this summer in New York, New Jersey and Maryland. FreshDirect, Safeway and ShopRite are also joining the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which last year provided more than $66 billion of help to 44.2 million needy Americans. This will be the first time SNAP has accepted online payment for groceries. Low-income shoppers are an intriguing target for Amazon, which has tried with mixed success to disrupt the $800 billion grocery market. More than 80 percent of food stamp recipients live in or near big cities, which are served by Amazon’s vast network of warehouses and home to the affluent and poor in close proximity. A truck delivering gluten-free chia seed bars and organic soy coffee creamer to Manhattan’s posh Upper West Side can also cart a box of cereal, bread and baby food to low-income housing projects in Harlem. “There are very few retailers who can serve the high- and low-end of the income spectrum,” says Kirthi Kalyanam, director of the Retail Management Institute at Santa Clara University. “Costco customers are mostly affluent and Wal-Mart customers are mostly low income. No one retailer has been able to bridge the gap. Amazon is uniquely positioned to go all the way to the top and all the way to the bottom of the customer spectrum.” Amazon’s competition for urban food stamp recipients include convenience stores with limited inventory and high markups, providing Amazon an opportunity to stand out with its vast selection and low prices. The delivery program also lets food-stamp recipients use the benefit more discreetly than in a crowded store, where other shoppers can see how they’re paying for their groceries. For now, it’s unclear if Amazon plans to deliver the groceries to doorsteps, require pickup from central locations or leave that up to shoppers. Amazon’s push into groceries borrows a page from big box competitors that sell food at or below cost to get people into the store with hopes that they also buy higher-margin items such as clothing and electronics. People buy groceries frequently, putting a retailer in regular contact with the shopper and generating order volume that can help Amazon achieve economies of scale that are crucial to make e-commerce profitable. Annual online grocery spending in the U.S. will more than double to $70 billion by 2021, estimates Cowen and Company. “For Amazon, this continues to drive logistics and transportation costs per unit lower as these routes are combined with current routes to create more efficient transportation costs,” says Neil Ackerman, a former Amazon executive who runs e-commerce initiatives at Mondelez International. “While this program is focused on groceries, it also allows for customers to buy in other categories that Amazon can deliver, like fashion and electronics.” Amazon is the largest of seven retailers chosen for the two-year food stamps program. The Department of Agriculture, which administers SNAP, sees access to online groceries as a benefit to urban and rural residents with limited shopping options. The pilot will let the agency work out any payment and security issues before allowing online food stamp purchases nationally. Serving food stamp recipients would put Amazon on the front lines of eliminating “food deserts,” urban and rural areas where healthy, affordable food options are scarce for those without cars. Doing so provides a public relations boost for a company better known for delivering a bottle of laundry detergent within an hour to a time-strapped shopper willing to pay $8 to skip a trip to the store. Amazon took heat last year after a Bloomberg investigation revealed that some predominantly minority neighborhoods in Boston, New York, Chicago, Dallas and Washington, D.C., were excluded from Amazon’s same-day delivery service. Amazon has since expanded the service and filled the gaps. “We are committed to making food accessible through online grocery shopping, offering all customers the lowest prices possible,” Amazon said in an e-mailed statement. “Amazon’s selection and competitive pricing can improve the grocery shopping experience for SNAP participants while helping them extend their benefits further.” The push is potentially bad news for Wal-Mart, which gets more than half its $298 billion in annual U.S. revenue from grocery sales. The world’s biggest retailer is already battling German-owned chain Aldi and other discount grocers for low-income shoppers. Now the world’s biggest online retailer is chasing those shoppers too. “It’s a whole new demographic and market for Amazon to tap,” says Edward Jones & Co. analyst Brian Yarbrough. Amazon in April introduced a $10.99 monthly payment plan for Prime, making it more appealing to those who can’t afford a one-time $99 yearly fee. That helped Amazon increase Prime membership among those earning less than $25,000 a year from six percent in 2014 to 11 percent at the end of 2016, says Michael Levin, of Consumer Intelligence Research Partners in Chicago, which surveys Amazon shoppers. “Some of these customers use food stamps,” Levin says. “So Amazon would naturally want to accept them.” Most Read Everett man allegedly threatens 2 with machete EVERETT — An Everett man landed in jail after allegedly striking two… Jan 14th, 2017 by Eric Stevick Seattle Seahawks vs. Atlanta Falcons: Game Day preview Saturday’s game between the Seattle Seahawks (10-5-1) and the Atlanta Falcons (11-5)… Jan 14th, 2017 by Nick Patterson Editorial cartoons for Saturday, Jan. 14 Editorial cartoons for Saturday, Jan. 14 Jan 14th, 2017 Flu death toll rises to 8 in Snohomish County EVERETT — This year’s influenza epidemic has now killed eight people in… Jan 14th, 2017 by Sharon Salyer Illegal parking lot highlights silt problems in area streams KENMORE — As Eric Adman paddled a canoe into the mouth of… Jan 15th, 2017 by Noah Haglund © 2017, Everett Herald and Sound Publishing, Inc.

Life & Style Books The Biblioracle: Don't shop at Amazon's new Chicago store Amazon bookstore Elaine Thompson / AP 2015 The few dollars you may save at the Amazon bookstore coming to Chicago’s Southport Corridor will come at a cost. The few dollars you may save at the Amazon bookstore coming to Chicago’s Southport Corridor will come at a cost. (Elaine Thompson / AP 2015) John WarnerContact ReporterChicago Tribune I have a favor to ask: When Amazon opens its retail store in the Southport Corridor area of Lakeview later this year, please do not shop there. It will be tempting, because the store will seem shiny and the merchandise will interact with your smartphone, informing you of prices and additional recommendations. You will be offered discounts on Echo, Amazon's home "digital assistant"; Prime memberships; and access to streaming content. And the books will be less expensive than at your local independent store. RELATED: TRENDING LIFE & STYLE NEWS THIS HOUR But those few dollars saved will come at the expense of something more important: our community, our values. Amazon is not evil, but it is a corporation, and corporations do what corporations do — whatever it takes to maximize profits and shareholder value. In the case of Amazon, in the past, that's meant subjecting warehouse workers to inhuman conditions and their corporate employees to a kind of white-collar Hunger Games. Discounts are not free. They are financed with your privacy, as Amazon harvests and monetizes every last tidbit of information it can gather about you in order to sell you more stuff. Amazon is not concerned about your welfare and it is not in the business of protecting anyone's rights. Take that Amazon Echo, the cute little cylinder that will tell you the weather forecast or play Miles Davis or order new socks at your command. That device is always listening to everything said within its range. As of now, unless the Echo is activated, it does not record the information or send it to Amazon's servers, but as part of a murder investigation, police in Bentonville, Ark., have subpoenaed data collected by an Echo present in the home at the time of the alleged crime. An ever-present listening device is something out of a "1984"-like dystopia, and yet many are inviting this intrusion into their lives. Beyond the privacy issues, Amazon is unconcerned with quality of life in local communities. We have seen entire towns crash on the shoals after giving in to the siren song of Wal-Mart's low, low prices. Wal-Mart moves in, bringing not just those low prices but low-paying  jobs too. Unable to compete, the existing local businesses fail, putting communities into a death spiral, until so many people leave that Wal-Mart also pulls up the stakes. Instant ghost town. Obviously, Chicago isn't going to become a ghost town, but we should be very aware of the cultural and community riches we have in our many independent book stores. The vitality of places like Women & Children First, Quimby's, Unabridged Bookstore, City Lit Books, RoscoeBooks and a dozen others I could name are part of what make Chicago a vibrant city. That vitality is also why I am not overly worried about an Amazon store colonizing Lakeview. Chicago is better than this. But we must be vigilant in the face of these threats and remind ourselves that the people who own and work in the local stores are our neighbors, are here to stay and are invested in ways a corporation could never match. We have seen how easy it is to let something meaningful slip through our fingers. Chicago's literary culture shouldn't be trusted to one man in Seattle. John Warner's most recent book is "Tough Day for the Army." Twitter @biblioracle Book recommendations from the Biblioracle John Warner tells you what to read next based on the last five books you've read. 1. "Fifth Business" by Robertson Davies 2. "World of Wonders" by Robertson Davies 3. "The Manticore" by Robertson Davies 4. "Stoner" by John Williams 5. "A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man" by James Joyce — Robert P., San Diego Robert has apparently recently devoured Robert Davies' "Deptford Trilogy," an activity to which I give my highest endorsement. As for what he should read next, the answer is "A Sport and a Pastime" by James Salter. 1. "Hidden Figures: The American Dream and the Untold Story of the Black Women Mathematicians Who Helped Win the Space Race" by Margot Lee Shetterly 2. "Queen Sugar" by Natalie Baszile 3. "Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children" by Ransom Riggs 4. "Homegoing" by Yaa Gyasi 5. "The Kitchen House" by Kathleen Grissom — Natalie P., Chicago I feel like Natalie may be in the mood for some Toni Morrison. Let's go with "The Bluest Eye." 1. "The Undoing Project" by Michael Lewis 2. "The Underground Railroad" by Colson Whitehead 3. "Hillbilly Elegy" by J.D. Vance 4. "Unbroken" by Laura Hillenbrand 5.

"Following" : "Follow"}} January 12, 2017 12:11pm   Comments Share: Related BAC Big Banks Benefit From Trading Binge After Election, But Retail Sales Come In Light Jim Cramer On JPMorgan: Best Quarter Ever An Arbitrage Trade In This Morgan Stanley Preferred Stock Has Come To Fruition (Seeking Alpha) Related FDX Retailers, Shippers Prepare For January 5, 'National Returns Day' Benzinga's Top Upgrades, Downgrades For December 23, 2016 Workday Inc (NYSE: WDAY) announced its biggest deal ever after signing retail giant Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE: WMT), which will go a long way in boosting Workday’s brand value and will also set the stage for further high-profile deals in the future. Huge Wal-Mart Deal Wal-Mart, the largest employer in the United States, employing over 2.3 million people worldwide, would subscribe to Workday’s HCM, recruiting, learning, and planning solutions. The deal is a validation of Workday's product portfolio and ability to support one of the most demanding customers in the world. Moreover, the mega HR contract with Wal-Mart soothed investor concerns after weakness with large deals in early November resulted in soft fourth-quarter outlook, leading to a sharp selloff in Workday shares in early December. “Beyond the financial implications of today's win, we believe this deal has important psychological implications for the stock and the company's brand with leading organizations around the world,” Brian White of Drexel Hamilton wrote in a note. Assuming all of Wal-Mart’s 2 million plus employees subscribe to Workday, White estimates the deal could be worth $100 million to $200 million in annual revenue. However, Workday did not specify the number of Wal-Mart employees who will be part of this subscription. Also, a deal of this size will take some time to ramp. Thus, the analyst is not expecting the full revenue impact be felt in the first year or two. Recall that Workday did not change its guidance for 2017's fourth quarter or FY 2018. Prior To Wal-Mart Deal Before signing Wal-Mart, Workday clientele included International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE: IBM), 350,000 employees; HP Inc (NYSE: HPQ), 300,000 employees; Bank of America Corp (NYSE: BAC), 300,000 employees; and FedEx Corporation (NYSE: FDX), 250,000 employees. “While already an impressive list, even the largest previously publicly announced customer (IBM) is smaller than one-sixth the size of Walmart,” Baird analyst Steven Ashley wrote in a note. Beyond the geo-political disruption, Ashley noted billings face additional headwinds in the form of reduced subscription revenues due to flexible deal terms, slowed long-term deferred revenue growth and slowed professional services revenue growth. A Positive Look Forward That said, the company’s business is gaining momentum, especially regarding financials. The company would announce the marquee customer it recently signed for Workday Financials in the fourth-quarter call. Ashley expects Workday to post a strong financials quarter in the fourth quarter. In fact, White believes the biggest market opportunity for Workday remains in financials (over $27 billion), followed by analytics (over $19 billion) and HCM (over $13 billion).

Bentonville and the surrounding areas had been booming, but it looks like times may be changing. (MIke Mozart/Flickr/CC) The stock market has been on quite a roll in recent weeks, but signs of trouble continue to plague the real economy.  Earlier this week, I talked about the "retail apocalypse" now sweeping America. Major retail chains such as Sears and Macy's are closing stores and laying off workers, but I didn't think Wal-Mart would be feeling the pain as well. Unfortunately, that's precisely what is happening. USA Today is reporting that approximately 1,000 jobs will be cut at Wal-Mart's corporate headquarters in Bentonville, Arkansas by the end of this month: Wal-Mart's plan to lay off of hundreds of employees is the latest ripple in a wave of job cuts and store closures that are roiling the retail industry. The world's largest retailer is cutting roughly 1,000 jobs at its corporate headquarters in Bentonville, Arkansas, later this month, according to a person familiar with the matter who was not authorized to speak about it. The company is saying these cuts are necessary because Wal-Mart is always "looking for ways to operate more efficiently and effectively." But something doesn't smell right here. You don't get rid of 1,000 employees at your corporate headquarters if everything is just fine. I have driven past Wal-Mart's headquarters in Bentonville a number of times, and it is in a beautiful part of the country. Bentonville and the surrounding areas had been booming, but it looks like times may be changing. Meanwhile, there are signs of trouble out on the west coast as well. The Los Angeles Times is reporting that there is going to be a new round of engineering job cuts at Boeing. Boeing Co. has internally announced a new round of employee buyouts for engineers company-wide, including in Southern California, and warned that layoff notices will follow later this month to engineers in Washington state, where the company has a large presence. Management did not cite a target for the number of projected job cuts. The news comes after company Vice Chairman Ray Conner and the new chief executive of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, or BCA, Kevin McAllister, warned in December of the need to aim for further cuts in 2017. And according to Boeing spokesperson Doug Alder, similar job cut announcements are coming for other classes of workers as well. So why is Boeing getting rid of so many employees? Well, the truth is that Boeing's business is way down. The following comes from Wolf Richter: Business has been tough. In 2016, deliveries fell by 14 jets from a year ago, to 748. Net orders dropped 13 percent from an already-rotten level in 2015, to just 668, down 53 percent from 2014. And the lowest level since 2010! When the economy is doing well, air traffic tends to rise, and when the economy is doing poorly, it tends to go down. Needless to say, the fact that Boeing is doing so poorly does not bode well for the future. In addition to Wal-Mart, another major retailer that is letting people go is Petco. <a href="https://charisma-d.openx.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=6421ee36eb&cb=1967879577" ><img src="https://charisma-d.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=536873539&cs=6421ee36eb&cb=1967879577" border="0" alt=""></a> advertisement Petco is cutting 180 positions with about 50 at its San Diego headquarters, the pet supply retailer confirmed Wednesday. The company made the cuts across its workforce and include both existing and open positions. Petco has about 650 workers at its headquarters in Rancho Bernardo. It employs 27,000 in the U.S. My wife and I have three cats, and even though Petco tends to be a bit overpriced, we have always appreciated the work they do. Unfortunately, when the economy gets tough, spending on pets tends to be one of the first things to get cut back, and this current trouble at Petco could be a sign that rough sledding is ahead for the entire economy. Of course, your personal perspective on these things is likely to be very heavily influenced by your immediate surroundings. Those who live in wealthy enclaves of major cities such as San Francisco, New York City or Washington, D.C. may be wondering how anyone could possibly be talking about economic trouble right now. But if you live in economically depressed areas of Appalachia or the upper Midwest, it may seem as though the last economic recession never even ended. There have been pockets of economic prosperity in recent years, and this has resulted in some people becoming exceedingly wealthy. Meanwhile, things have just continued to become even tougher for millions of other families as the cost of living always seems to grow faster than their paychecks do. If you are in the top one percent of all income earners, maybe to you it seems as though things have never been better. But most of the country is living paycheck to paycheck and is just struggling to survive from month to month. The following comes from CNN: The rich are money-making machines. Today, the top mega-wealthy—the top 1%—earn an average of $1.3 million a year. It's more than three times as much as the 1980s, when the rich "only" made $428,000, on average, according to economists Thomas Piketty, Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman. Meanwhile, the bottom 50% of the American population earned an average of $16,000 in pre-tax income in 1980. That hasn't changed in over three decades. The workers being laid off at the companies discussed above are real people with real hopes and real dreams. Perhaps many of them will be able to land other employment fairly soon, but the truth is that the job market is really tough in many areas of the country right now. Finding a good job that will allow you to pay the bills and support your family is not easy. You may find that out the hard way if you end up losing your current job during the economic troubles that will come in 2017. Earlier today, I came across an excellent article by Gail Tverberg that detailed a bunch of reasons a significant economic downturn appears to be imminent in 2017. If you would like to read it, you can find it here. She points to many of the same things to which I have been pointing for a very long time. Even though economic conditions were fairly stable throughout 2016, our long-term problems continued to get even worse. So the truth is that we are more primed for a major crisis today than we have been at any point since the last recession. My hope is that things will not be nearly as bad in 2017 as Gail Tverberg and others are projecting that they could be, but the warning signs are definitely there, and it isn't going to take much to push the U.S. economy off the rails.

If that’s not for you, though, there’s another strategy I highly recommend as an alternative to just buying stocks. And that’s buying deep-in-the-money (DITM), long-dated, call option contracts. You see, option contracts are the greatest financial products ever created, since leverage lets many investors participate in trades that would otherwise be out of reach. Now, many investors think that leverage is too risky. And they have a point. Leverage’s ability to magnify your gains can have the reverse effect, as well. But here’s a way you can participate in the massive upside potential options offer, while reducing risk at the same time. Buying Shares At a 73% Discount Let’s use Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) as our prime example. If you wanted to buy 100 shares of Wal-Mart today, it would cost you roughly $7,475. But by using DITM options, those same 100 shares would cost you roughly $2,020. That’s a solid $5,455 cheaper – or a 73% discount.  So what does deep-in-the-money mean? Basically, DITM options have strike prices that are set much lower than the current price of the stock. The options chain to the right shows a partial listing of available call option contracts to trade on Wal-Mart (at its current price of $74.75). Let’s focus on the January 2014 $55 strike price, which is around $19.75 below the stock price. The cost to buy the option is roughly $2,020 per contract. Remember, each contract represents 100 shares of stock. The benefits of buying the option instead of the stock are two-fold: First, you’re only spending $2,020 instead of $7,475 to control the same 100 shares, but you’re benefiting from similar movement (more on that below). Plus, you’re cutting your total risk in the trade by $5,455. The most you can ever lose when buying options is what you paid for them. In this case, you can’t lose more than $2,020. Wal-Mart shareholders have $7,475 at risk. That’s a big difference. However, DITM isn’t the only thing you need to focus on to make sure you’re getting the best deal possible. High Delta is Key It’s also crucial that you pinpoint the options with at least a 90% or higher “delta.” Delta refers to how closely the option price moves in relation to the underlying stock. In other words, the higher the delta, the more the option moves in lockstep with the stock. Since the whole point of buying options is to pocket massive gains when the stock moves in your favor, the best way to do that is to choose options with a high delta. Have you ever bought a call or put-option contract and its value didn’t increase – even though the stock price moved a good distance in your favor? Depressing, wasn’t it? Most likely it was because you didn’t own an option with a high enough delta. As I said, a good delta to go with is at least 90%. Just to clarify, that means the option price should move 90% in the same direction of the stock’s movement. As you can see, the $55 strike price option boasts a 96% delta. The screenshots of an options calculator below show this principle working in real-time. The calculator on top shows what the options trade for at Wal-Mart’s current price of $74.75. The one on the bottom shows what the option would likely trade for if shares hit $75.75. As you can see, the option price went up almost a dollar, just like the stock. That’s the kind of movement you need. What novice option traders usually do is pick the cheapest option contracts based on the actual dollar value. It makes them feel like they’re getting a better deal. But what they don’t realize is that the cheaper the option price, the lower the delta will be, which means they’ll see less cash in the end. So what happens when the options expire in January 2014? Well, if Wal-Mart increased like you hoped it would, you can sell the options and bank the gain. Or you can “exercise” the option and turn it into actual shares of stock. If you choose the latter, you’ll have to pay for the stock in full at that time. Usually, the first scenario is the best bet, since you could just sell the option and use the profits to buy another position. And you’re still participating in the move higher like you would if you actually owned shares. Only this way, you’re keeping your cost and risk low at the same time. So do yourself a favor… If you’re ever going to buy a stock, consider buying DITM options with a high delta instead. You’ll be glad you did.

[Reply] Joseph says: April 26, 2015 at 3:00 pm You say “Plus, you’re cutting your total risk in the trade by $5,455. The most you can ever lose when buying options is what you paid for them. In this case, you can’t lose more than $2,020.” This is only partly true. Yes, the amount of money that’s on the line is smaller; but on the other hand, there is a much greater chance that you will lose all your money when buying the option than buying the actual stock. This is because if the stock price drops below your strike price you lose your entire investment whereas when you buy the actual stock the only way you lose all your money is if the company’s share price goes down to zero, a much less likely scenario than the price falling below the strike price. [Reply] Max Baer Reply: May 7th, 2015 at 8:27 am Excellent point, Joseph! Even deep-in-the-money options pose a high risk if a stock goes into an unexpected, yet temporary, free fall. If the option expires before the stock recovers, you could lose all your money on the position, whereas the underlying stock may well appreciate nicely after the expiration of the option, but too late for you to benefit from it. [Reply] Dominic says: July 11, 2015 at 4:15 am So I should find a DITM call with a high delta, right? As opposed to what? A DITM call with a low delta? (If your broker offers you a DITM call with a low delta you should find another brokerage.) [Reply] 56 says: August 9, 2016 at 10:11 am Deep in money have deep premiums in addition to another deep premium cost factor for options (time, and its your forgiving friend if you buy enough of it) . Less contracts for that $2000. What’s wrong with at the money/slightly out of the money. Lower premiums, more contracts, and time if you choose to pay for it. Delta of .6-7 isn’t as nice as .9 for sure but considering you can ramp up the number of contracts the $ buys and/or get more time I mean really the thing that matters is being proved right on strike+premium anytime before expiration. I would recommend the hell out of put options vs shorting. More gains, no obligations,no sneaky dividends. Time is against shorts anyways, not such a big swallow for a put. [Reply] Sri says: November 4, 2016 at 5:07 pm How does one calculate delta? [Reply] Jon says: January 11, 2017 at 3:06 pm Well, I guess you always have a risk of assignment….so how does it help other than accumulating the shares in case of PUT sell and in case of Call – it can be called away from you anytime costing you that capital [Reply] Add Comment Cancel reply Name (required, will be published) Mail (required, will not be published) Website Click to cancel reply Innovation Will Driverless Cars Kill Their Masters?

Photos of the weekend SUBSCRIBE Job postings are shown outside a new Walmart Super Center as the company opens its first store in Compton, California, on January 10, 2017. REUTERS/Mike Blake | Caption Patrick Reilly Staff January 11, 2017 —Even the world’s largest retailer can’t avoid the challenges facing brick-and-mortar stores. Wal-Mart will soon cut hundreds of jobs from its Bentonville, Ark., headquarters and its regional offices, as The Wall Street Journal first reported this week. The announcement comes amid a downturn for some traditional retail stores. Macy’s and Sears are cutting back, as The Christian Science Monitor reported last week, as more consumers shop online or at discount-rack stores, although some segments, like fast fashion, have bucked the trend. Wal-Mart, which predicts flat earnings growth for its next fiscal year, is also feeling the pinch. “We are always looking for ways to operate more efficiently and effectively,” spokesman Greg Hitt told Fortune, although he did not confirm job cuts. But unlike other troubled chains, which have closed stores and laid off retail staff, Wal-Mart is cutting costs at the corporate level. Meanwhile, it’s continuing an expensive – and controversial – effort to improve its stores by paying workers more. For years, labor groups criticized Wal-Mart for its treatment of retail staff, including its wages and a lack of unions. A 2011 study from the University of California, Berkeley found that its employees earned an estimated 12.4 percent less than retail workers as a whole, and 14.5 percent less than workers in large retail in general. Last year, the chain announced a "two-year, $2.7 billion investment in workers," in which all employees hired before January 1st, 2016 would receive at least $10 per hour; new hires' wages would start at $9 per hour, but increase to $10 after they complete a training program. Ten companies with great starting wages Amid rising concerns about inequality and low minimum wages, this pay hike at the world’s largest retailer sparked debate. Some saw the wage hikes as a smart business decision that better motivated workers and reversed years of customer complaints about poor service. But others saw the wage increase as trouble for Wal-Mart’s bottom line, and dismissed some arguments in favor of it – such as the idea that better-paid employees would spend more in-store, helping to offset the losses of paying higher wages.  Follow Stories Like This Get the Monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox. Sign-Up × Other critics argued the wage hike didn't go far enough, as the Monitor reported in 2015: But advocates for low-wage workers, while supporting the wage boost, say the pay increases will have minimal effect on workers' lives without a full workweek. Companies like Wal-Mart have turned the scheduling of part-time workers into a science, says Tsedeye Gebreselassie, senior staff attorney with the National Employment Law Project. Computer programs used by Wal-Mart and other large retail outlets piece together employee schedules and are frequently programmed to keep employees' hours below the threshold where benefits kick in, she says. “These are super-sophisticated programs that work in real time calculating to the minute based on customer traffic, calling people in to work and sending them home accordingly,” she says. “Working there makes it nearly impossible to plan a stable budget, have another job, or go to schools.” This week's job-cutting news comes as the latest of several Wal-Mart cost-cutting measures which have left white-collar employees in Bentonville uneasy. In September, the company announced it would cut 7,000 back-office positions; last October, it eliminated 450 positions at headquarters, a move it said would make Wal-Mart more "nimble." But unlike their counterparts at Sears or Macy’s, the sales associates at your local Wal-Mart are probably breathing a sigh of relief.

I have several children and daycare kids and every time I go there they are stored outside (which yes I know they take up a lot of room) so they are usually freezing cold or wet for the kids to sit in. And pretty much all of the straps to hold them in are broken, so I’m trying to hold kids down so they don’t fall out and push/shop at the same time 🙁 Current score: 0 (Please enable JavaScript to vote.)

(AMZN) Stock Is About to Catch Fire Why Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO) Stock Won’t Be Growing Anytime Soon View All Posts There’s an age-old battle between Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) and Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) that leads investors to question which is the better stock. Target stock has gone up nearly 8% each year for the past five years, while Walmart stock only averages a little over 3% in the past five years. Likewise, TGT stock yields 3.2% and the company’s earnings grew 10.7% last quarter, but WMT stock only yields 2.8% and its earnings declined 8.2%. Yet investors generally view Target as weaker than Walmart — is this viewpoint wrong? Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified) Lately, TGT stock has certainly been the weaker big-box retailer. It’s up a measly 0.67% year to date, compared to WMT’s 13.8% bump. And its past series of missteps — a massive breach of customers’ credit and debit card information in 2013, its ill-conceived Target Canada launch, its controversial decision to allow transgender customers to use the bathroom of their choice, among others — have damaged the company’s once pristine reputation with the general public and Wall Street. But the above numbers put Target stock’s recent drop-off in perspective. Sprinkle in a relatively low price-to-earnings ratio of 13 (compared to Walmart’s P/E of 15), solid earnings growth projections for this year and next and some nice share-price momentum over the last six weeks, and you have a stock that looks pretty attractive. Sales Declines Are Dragging TGT Stock Down There’s just one problem with the picture: Target’s sales aren’t what they used to be. Revenues have only made a small comeback in the most recent quarter after significant declines in the past two quarters, and same-store sales have tumbled for two straight quarters. The store just doesn’t have the same buzz it once did. 7 Beaten-Down Tech Stocks to Buy With 50% Upside in 2017 But Walmart’s sales have been equally uninspiring, failing to reach more than 1% growth for seven straight quarters. Putting the string of embarrassing headlines aside, Target has the same problems as its much larger competitors: Americans are turning their backs on the big-box stores in favor of the convenience of online shopping. Therefore, the key for Target stock to return to growth is online sales. Right now, online sales account for less than 5% of TGT’s total sales, despite a 26% uptick in the third quarter, ahead of Walmart’s 20.6% digital growth. In fact, Target has routinely defeated WMT in that department, and it should continue to do so given that the average Target shopper is younger than the average Walmart shopper. (TGT’s customers also make about 25% more money than WMT’s customers do, which means they’re more likely to swallow the extra shipping costs that come with online shopping.)

In a Consumer Reports investigation on customer service, the Bentonville, Ark.-based retailer and its wholesale retail cousin Sam’s Club, were rated among the worst for customer service.  In fact, Walmart and Sam’s were among the worst for customer service in eight industries including appliances, electronics, cell phones and supermarkets. In the report, one Walmart shopper recounts how a poorly trained and dismissive sales associate insisted that her purchase of the wrong version of a Bible could not be returned because company policy didn’t allow returned books. After 20 minutes and the sales associate’s inability to produce the policy, the reluctant sales associate discovered it could be returned and funds returned to the customer’s charge card. In tough times, the number of people available to help retail customers usually diminishes.  But many Americans believe companies are deliberately making it harder to contact them by burying phone numbers of company websites, diverting phone calls, and steering customers online for answers. When was the last time you telephoned a company’s customer service center and had a human being answer? In all fairness, Walmart probably was listed in so many categories for poor customer service because is it one of the few retailers that competes in so many sectors, specializes in low-priced items, and its stores are so large, a lap or two around it could amount to a mile’s walk. But could its subpar service have contributed to Walmart’s stagnant U.S. sales last year? It’s true that many Walmart customers like one-stop shopping and may be willing to give up a little personal attention for the savings that come with cheap prices and bulk purchases. But I doubt that any shopper who isn’t competing to be the next American Idol wants to spend their money with a retailer that allows inaction, long waits and snippy responses from its staff. Of course, Walmart wasn’t the only big name company to piss its customers off.  The report also shares tales of frustrated customers getting bad customer service from AT&T (NYSE:T) and Dell (NASDAQ:DELL). But that should be of little comfort to Walmart or any retailer when its customers can go elsewhere. If you think they aren’t, read the report which says that 64% of the survey’s respondents said that during the last 12 months they’ve left a store because the service was poor. Sixty- seven percent hung up customer service because their problem wasn’t addressed. In this age of social media, retailers should beware.  If they aren’t willing to listen to customers complaints, I’m sure that visitors to social websites, such as privately-held Facebook Inc., Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and YouTube, certainly are. As of this writing, Cynthia Wilson did not own a position in any of the stocks named here.

CLOSE Politics Religion Sports Voting Laws Culture Health Immigration Technology Economy Education Energy Sunday, January 15, 2017 Insider K Street Lifestyle Opinion Politics Religion Sports Voting Laws Culture Health Immigration Technology Economy Education Energy Home Education Walmart $1 million Grant to CBCF Supports Interns Policy Education Walmart $1 million Grant to CBCF Supports Interns By Kenneth Mallory - 10:00pm October 26, 2011 921 12 SHARE Facebook Twitter Walmart’s recent $1 million grant to the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation is an injection of sorely needed funding to support the organizations’ highly coveted Emerging Leaders Internship program. A Walmart official stated the company was “honored” to partner with the CBCF. “Diversity is core to Walmart’s success and we are always honored to partner with organizations that share our commitment to helping minority students succeed in life. The congressional internship program is a wonderful example of an initiative for African-American students that works,” said Kimberly Woodard, Walmart’s director of federal government relations and CBCF board member, in a statement. “The program’s success over the last six years has raised the bar for congressional internships and we commend the CBCF for its commitment to promoting diversity on the Hill.” According to information provided by the CBCF, Walmart has provided $2 million to support the program since 2006. Traci L. Hughes, Communications Director for the CBCF, told Politic365 in a phone interview that Walmart’s monetary support was “invaluable.” “More than 80 of our students have benefited from the internship program and clearly the training and exposure they have received served them well,” said Hughes. “Many of them have gone on to work on Capitol Hill. They’re currently earning law degrees, MBAs, and have even started their own companies.” The internship program spans a semester and CBCF says the program “… prepares participating students for careers in public service or the private sector.  As a result of Walmart’s funding, interns also receive a stipend and housing during their internships.” According to the CBCF, Walmart’s funding will also help sponsor its Semester in Washington internship program, a project formed through a partnership with the George Washington University. Former CBCF intern and Hampton University graduate Darien E. Nolin — now a financial analyst for a federal agency and MBA candidate at the Johns Hopkins University — spoke to Politic365 about the value of the CBCF’s internship programs. Nolin said that his CBCF internship afforded him an opportunity to develop more professional relationships with other interns and those working in Congress as he benefited from “… the amount of exposure that it brought and the amount of confidence it gave [him] to pursue other things.” And it appears that Nolin is among CBCF intern alums making remarkable educational and professional strides. “When you look at today’s economy and see what our former interns are doing and where they are working, it affirms the quality and reputation of our program as the best training ground for college students interested in public and civic service,” said Muriel Cooper, CBCF Senior Media Manager, in an email to Politic365. CBCF provided the following list of the CBCF’s Class of 2009 Walmart Emerging Leaders and the different educational and professional endeavors they are currently engaged in: Keith Benjamin: Legislative Associate for the Transport Workers Union of America, AFL-CIO and co-Chair of The Young & Powerful Group DC Chapter. Dshawna Bernard: Co-President of CoverME TTT designed to assist children in low income communities throughout the nation.

Niara Phillips: Homeland Security analyst with Booz Allen Hamilton Danielle Bowers: Research Analyst for Rep. Ronald Waters, Chairman of the Pennsylvania Legislative Black Caucus (PLBC). Also a 2nd year graduate student in the MPA program at Penn State University. Carlissia Graham: Scheduler to Senator Kirsten Gillibrand and very involved with sex trafficking organizations in DC, including Courtney’s House. Charlin Caster: Contractor/Consultant for a government agency working on labor and economic publications, including researching marketing efforts to deliver career information to Hispanic communities and corresponding with incarcerated persons seeking career and re-entry information.

(Devin Heroux/CBC News) After two weeks of battling Walmart Canada, PJ Mazzonna has the resolution he's been hoping for.  CBC Toronto first published the story of Mazzonna nearly two weeks ago. His family had given him the money to buy himself a Sony Playstation virtual reality headset for Christmas but what he got was closer to a lump of coal. GTA man expected a gaming headset for Christmas - but got a dirty T-shirt instead When he tore open the sealed gaming box, he found a dirty T-shirt, two bottles of water, glass cleaner and a demo disc inside. Mazzonna immediately took the box full of items back to the Ajax, Ont. Walmart where the purchase was originally made. Store managers there didn't believe him. GTA man alleges he was sold a dirty T-shirt instead of a Sony headset1:25 On Wednesday, Mazzonna said a Walmart manager informed him by phone that the company would refund the nearly $600 it cost to buy the headset. "I guess they didn't believe me at the time," he said. "I don't know what ended up changing. I would have liked to have seen a bit of a faster response on this." Mazzonna says the managers at Walmart said they are still dealing with Sony to find out how the T-shirt, bottled water and can of glass cleaner ended up in the box. That investigation is still ongoing. In an email response, a Walmart official said a situation like this "is not common" and that they review their return policies on an ongoing basis.  But Mazzonna said his family and friends are now boycotting Walmart. "It isn't a good way to treat a customer. There's nothing Walmart offers I can't find somewhere else." Not a unique situation There is an increasing trend of people receiving damaged products, or as in Mazzonna's case, packaging with missing products, according to the Consumers Council of Canada. "It is an area that we're paying some attention to because of sales over the internet specifically," said the council's executive director Ken Whitehurst. Mississauga couple shocked after receiving empty iPhone box "When you get into a dispute where goods are not delivered or damaged then you have an evidentiary problem. How do you prove it?" Whitehurst said people have a high level of confidence in retailers and consumers should start making it common practice to open products in the store when possible. "We also have a convenience-driven society. We don't want to take that time. In fact a lot of retailers are becoming averse to people opening packaging that is quite secure."

By Natalie Gagliordi for Between the Lines | January 11, 2017 -- 19:51 GMT (11:51 PST) | Topic: Enterprise Software Cloud software vendor Workday just announced its biggest customer win to date -- discount retail giant Walmart. What's Hot on ZDNet Microsoft rolls out second Windows 10 Creators Update test build in a week House bill aims to block tech giants from building "Muslim registry" With the rise of global instability, can ceramic storage save our digital culture? CES 2017 recap video: Big trends, top products, and wackiest tech In an 8-k filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Workday said Walmart has purchased a subscription to Workday's Human Capital Management, Recruiting, Learning, and Planning products. Walmart has more than 2 million employees and is considered the world's largest private employer. Based on that employee count, the deal could, over time, be worth $100 million to $200 million in annual revenue for Workday, Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White noted in a research report. "However, Workday did not specify the number of Wal-Mart employees that will be part of this subscription," White said. "Also, a deal of this size will take some time to ramp and thus we do not expect the full revenue impact be felt in the first year or two." Shares of Workday are up around 7 percent. Workday said it is not updating financial guidance for Q4 of the current fiscal year ending January 31, 2017 or for fiscal year ending January 31, 2018. Workday released its Learning and Planning products last September at its Workday Rising conference in an effort to dramatically boost its footprint and addressable market. Out of its newer releases, Workday Planning has the most revenue potential given that so many companies still plan on spreadsheets. Workday Learning, which relies heavily on video and peer sharing of knowledge, is designed as a companion to the company's core HR software.

The manhunt for Markeith Loyd, accused of gunning down Orlando police Master Sgt. Debra Clayton in front of a Walmart Monday, stretched into a third day Wednesday as video from November surfaced showing his girlfriend joking at a traffic stop. “Go ahead and kill him, babe, so we can get home faster,” Sade Dixon playfully told her boyfriend, referring to the officer who pulled them over them over, according to a Facebook Live video. It’s not clear why the cop stopped them. Police said Markeith Loyd (r.) allegedly killed his girlfriend Sade Dixon (l.) in December. (Orange County Sheriff's Office) Later, when Loyd started speeding, the 24-year-old again teased him. Reward in Debra Clayton Orlando cop killing raised to $100,000 “You not about to kill me and the baby!” she said in the video, first uncovered by the Orlando Sentinel. “I'm not going to live past 25. I’m not going to make it!” Orlando police Master Sgt. Debra Clayton was shot outside of a Walmart Monday. (@OrlandoPolice via Twitter) About a month later, Loyd, 41, fatally shot Dixon inside her Orange County home in December, police said. The attack also killed their unborn child. Police had been hunting for the accused killer for weeks when Clayton, who was on duty and wearing her uniform, recognized him in front of an Orlando Walmart Monday. Loyd opened fire when the officer demanded he stop, police said. This man 😂😩Posted by Markeith Loyd on Friday, 4 November 2016 Clayton was rushed to a local hospital, where she was pronounced dead, and the shooting triggered a massive manhunt across Orlando. Orlando police officer shot dead near Walmart, manhunt for gunman As officers combed over the city Monday, two Orange County deputies were involved in motorcycle crashes. Deputy Norman Lewis, 35, died after a van struck him. Minutes later, Deputy Nelson Borjas suffered minor injuries in an unrelated motorcycle wreck. Lakensha Smith-Loyd was arrested on Wednesday. (Orange County Jail) Funerals are planned for Lewis on Friday, and Clayton on Saturday. On Tuesday, officers increased the bounty for information on the on-the-loose killer to $100,000 and said that they were preparing arrest warrants for those believed to have helped Loyd evade the cops. Zarghee Mayan was arrested Tuesday for allegedly helping Loyd. Zarghee Mayan, a 33-year-old former coworker of Loyd's at a fried chicken restaurant, was arrested later that night and charged with giving the fugitive food, transportation and money to him after the Dixon shooting. He allegedly told investigators that Loyd threatened him with death and made him drive the armed fugitive to his ex-wife's house, where no one answered the door, according to an arrest report seen by the Sentinel. Mayan, who admitted giving $200 to Loyd through his niece, said that the last time he saw Loyd was Saturday, two days before the killing of Clayton, and that his friend had a gun and was wearing body armor. The niece, 27-year-old Lakensha Smith-Loyd was arrested on Wednesday for collecting the money. Her arrest affidavit said that she originally cooperated with investigators after the Dixon killing before stopping. Also Wednesday, Jameis Slaughter, was arrested and is accused of being an accessory after the fact. Slaughter's relation to Loyd was not immediately disclosed.   With News Wire Services With CHRIS BRENNAN, CHRIS SOMMERFELDT Tags: florida pregnancy gun violence police officers shot domestic violence Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation: facebook Tweet Get Daily News stories, delivered to your inbox.

Carney spoke at the Northwest Arkansas Tech Council’s monthly meeting in Bentonville on Wednesday (Jan. 11) about her passion for mentoring young women in the area of STEM education. Carney said she’s spent more than three decades working in technology, the past 24 of those at Wal-Mart. “When I was in college half of the students in my math classes were women. That just isn’t the case today. We know girls that are encouraged to take STEM classes (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) and mentored along the way often excel in these fields,” Carney told Talk Business & Politics. But she said too often when there are not mentors beginning in the junior high years, girls will lose interest because they don’t fully understand that a career in technology doesn’t have to mean you are writing code for a lifetime. Carney said the first five years she worked at Wal-Mart, she was a database administrator, but most of her time since has been in a management capacity overseeing various infrastructure components, from hardware and software applications used by stores and suppliers for operations, logistics and elsewhere. MILLION WOMEN MENTORS Carney is taking part in the national movement known as Million Women Mentors along with Karenann Terrell, chief information officer for Wal-Mart Stores. They are leaders in the movement since Wal-Mart has sponsored the entire state as part of this national mentoring initiative active now for two years. Wal-Mart has not publicized this effort, and when asked for information twice last year, the retailer did not respond to Talk Business & Politics. Carney said the company is active in the program as a platinum level sponsor with funding, but the real work goes on with administrators in schools and the hundreds of mentor volunteers – men and women dedicated to engaging girls in STEM education and fostering mentorships for women and girls seeking technology careers. Rita Carney, vice president IT business continuity for Wal-Mart Technology Carney has taken on a mentee in the program who is now a student at NorthWest Arkansas Community College. Carney said mentors agree to spend 20 hours a year talking with and cheering on their mentees in the areas of STEM education. Carney shared a recent conversation she had with her mentee around her spring schedule at NWACC. Her mentee has an interest in robotics and works in the IT field now building and repairing computers. “I asked her what science she was taking this semester and she told me biology. I asked her why, wondering if she had an interest in medical technology. She told me biology would be easy. I then asked her what science might fit better with her field of robotics and she knew physics would be a better science but added there was so much math in that class. I asked her if she was taking a math class and what her grade was last semester in her math class. She told she had an A. So it wasn’t that she couldn’t do the math, she just needed a nudge. It felt great to get the text a few days later that she had changed her schedule and was now taking physics,” Carney said. She also spoke about the mentors she has had throughout her career, noting that some were men and some women and it took them all to get her where she is. WORKFORCE SHORTAGE Carney said part of the reason she is so passionate about mentoring girls in STEM education is because they are needed in the workforce as technology touches every business and is radically transforming most of them. Jobs in the STEM careers have grown three times faster than non-STEM jobs in the past decade and 80% of the fastest growing occupations in the U.S. depend upon mastery of mathematics and scientific knowledge. While women comprise 50% of the U.S. workforce, just 24% are in STEM fields, a statistic that has held constant for nearly the last  decade, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce. Almost one-third of all male freshmen, compared with only 15% of all female freshmen, plan to major in a STEM field even though 15 out of the 20 fastest growing occupations in 2015 are expected to require science or mathematics training. Carney said women often leave STEM degree paths despite good academic standing. Even when they persist and earn a STEM degree, women are less likely than their male counterparts to work in a STEM field, despite the fact the pay is high. She said women might only earn 72 cents for every $1 a man earns in the same profession, but that isn’t true in technology related jobs. She said there is near parity and women who excel into leadership roles often earn more than men because they are in such high demand. ARKANSAS EFFORT She encouraged every business person attending the meeting to think about how they might take part in the Million Women Mentors program in Arkansas which began last year in concert with Lt. Governor Tim Griffin who conducted a roadshow in the six largest areas of Arkansas last year to drum up interest in the program. Carney said Griffin will in 2017 visit six more areas including Batesville, Harrison, Russellville and Arkadelphia. Carney said Wal-Mart is working with high school students and RockFish Interactive is working with middle school students and there are many opportunities for groups and businesses to engage. She said the Girls Scouts are taking part and working with girls as young as kindergarten age. “It’s going to take many more to help us reach our goal which is now 2 million girls with mentors, now that more states have jumped onboard,” Carney said. “We know that helping girls excel in STEM fields can be a game-changer for households and generations because women often reinvest their success in their communities.” Carney said there are several programs at work from Ozark Stem Education, AR Girls Code, Hour of Code and coding camps taking place for pre-teens across the region but too often even when there is a scholarship to cover the cost, the girls don’t have transportation for these camps that take place in the summer. “Surely there is an answer given we are an Uber society, but too many people don’t know there is problem,” she added. LOCAL SUCCESS Caroline Gschwend, a high school senior in Rogers, also spoke at the meeting. Gschwend, homeschooled her entire life, entered the Congressional App Challenge in 2016 after she attended a couple of summer coding camps. She began to play around with app creation in areas that interested her. She created the DefendUs App which was selected as the winner for the 3rd Congressional District. Gschwend said it took her about two weeks to come up the gaming app that is set in the American Revolution and has chief characters in the war (history heroes) fighting off their foes. She used IOS and Swift coding to design the app. Gschwend said she is still trying to decide on which college she will attend but the short list includes University of Arkansas, University of California-Berkeley, and University of California-Los Angeles. Her plans are to major in computer science and she has already signed up to mentor younger girls in STEM. Carney congratulated Gschwend on winning the Congressional App Challenge which garnered her a trip to Washington D.C. she plans to take in April. Also last year she was one of 28 international winners in the Google Code-In competition which landed her a trip to San Francisco and tour of Google Headquarters. “If you want to leave me your business card Caroline, I will be glad to take it,” Carney told the teen. “If you don’t have one, you really should get some and I am not kidding.” Carney closed the meeting with a call to action saying there are many more mentors needed and not everyone has to be a coder. She said marketing, design and an interest in technology can qualify someone as a program mentor. She said men also are being asked to step forward to raise the next generation of tech savvy females it will take to keep the world moving forward.

The catch: You'll need to pay to get your taxes done. H&R Block promotes its Refund Advance program on storefront windows, like one in Hazel Park in early January. (Photo: Susan Tompor) It's going to be hard to turn on the TV, drive past a tax preparation storefront or walk into a Walmart early into this tax season and not be deluged with pitches for fast-cash, refund-related loans at 0%. H&R Block, Jackson Hewitt and others are fighting for market share and trying to lock in customers who might otherwise turn to an online competitor, like TurboTax. The strategy is to heavily market easy money loans for a limited time — typically through February — to struggling tax filers who benefit from the Earned Income Tax Credit but now face added delays for early refund money. Consumers who might receive refunds of $4,000 or more thanks to the Earned Income Tax Credit now are told not to expect refund money until Feb. 27, a few weeks later than usual. Experts say early filers still should file in January and February, like usual, as waiting might drag out the process even more. The 0% pitches come at a time when the working poor and moderate-income families are particularly vulnerable because they turn to early tax refunds to cover winter heating bills and other expenses. "They expect refunds at a certain time," said Chi Chi Wu, staff attorney for the National Consumer Law Center. "These are families who can use every penny they can get." But the rules changed this tax season, thanks to a push in Congress to combat fraud and crooks who steal IDs to file fake tax returns that tap into generous tax credits, like the EITC, to rip off the federal government. H&R Block estimates some 15 million tax filers who receive the EITC and often file early could face delays. "With this client, there are real needs for cash," said William Cobb, CEO of H&R Block. On Monday, H&R Block rolled out its Refund Advance product,  which is being pitched as a 0% interest loan with no finance charges. The H&R Block tax-related loan will be made in the amounts of $500, $750, or $1,250 upfront, based on the eligibility of the client. Refund Advance is offered by H&R Block through a partnership with MetaBank, a federal savings bank based in Sioux Falls, S.D., which can provide up to $1.6 billion of such loans to H&R Block customers. The loan itself is available if the tax filer is projected to have a tax refund of at least $1,000. The H&R Block loan is only available in H&R Block offices, not online. "We're driven to get more clients," Cobb said. "This is about as consumer-friendly as you can get." Refunds will be later This tax season, many tax filers on the edge could very well take a second look at such products. Beginning this year, the IRS by law cannot release tax refunds for returns that claim Earned Income Tax Credit or the Additional Child Tax Credit until Feb. 15. The Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 — known as the PATH Act — put these extra hurdles into place as a way to combat fraud and ID theft. Realistically, tax experts say it could be until Feb. 27 or so by the time many early tax filers receive their refund cash. It's not a small point for many families. "For most Americans who file in January and February, they really rely on their refund as one of their biggest checks of the year," said David Prokupek, CEO of Jackson Hewitt. Prokupek said some $50 billion of refunds could be delayed as a result of the new law and many consumers will want some product to deal with those kind of numbers. "No one has that much spare change lying around," Prokupek said. Jackson Hewitt offers loans Jackson Hewitt's Express Refund Advance is marketed as a loan with no fees, a 0% annual percentage rate and no credit check. Jackson Hewitt's Express Refund Advance offers loans in amounts of $250, $500, $750, $1,000 and $1,300 — again depending on what the customer is approved for by MetaBank. For example, someone who is likely to get a $500 tax refund might qualify for a $250 advance. Jackson Hewitt kicked off its tax season in late November by offering a way for taxpayers to prequalify for an Express Refund Advance by answering a few questions on www.ExpressRefundAdvance.com. Early loans could even be granted with just a pay stub — not W-2s, which are to be out by Jan. 31. Shoppers at Walmart — Jackson Hewitt has tax service operations in 3,000 Walmart stores — are seeing signs in the store promoting the new refund advance product. Again, the advance loans are only available if you go to a Walmart location or one of Jackson Hewitt's storefronts. You cannot obtain the loans online. "Handing out money over the Internet without seeing your face or ID is not something we want to do," Prokupek said. To get the loan, you will have to pay to file your taxes with Jackson Hewitt. And if you take out a refund advance at H&R Block, you'd have to file your taxes with H&R Block. The advances would be repaid with actual tax refund money when that's issued. If you qualify for the Jackson Hewitt advance product, customers can receive the money via direct deposit or loaded onto an American Express Serve Card at no charge. One promotion offers customers who opt for the American Express prepaid card a $50 Walmart gift card. "Consumers are spending their refund dollars at Walmart," Prokupek said. With the American Express Serve card, consumers can withdraw cash for free at MoneyPass-branded ATMs, which are listed online at www.moneypass.com. Consumers would pay a $3.50 American Express Serve fee for withdrawing cash at non-MoneyPass ATMs. And it's possible that the ATM operator may also charge a fee. The H&R Block loan is loaded onto a H&R Block Emerald Prepaid MasterCard. You'd pay a $3 fee at ATMs for withdrawing cash. You can avoid added surcharge fees by getting cash at MoneyPass ATMs or Allpoint ATMs in 7-Eleven and CVS stores. Ask before you sign up So what are the questions consumers need to ask, if they're tempted by 0% refund advances? One concern: How much will tax preparation services cost you? Financially strapped tax filers could be tempted to pay up to a few hundred dollars or so for tax preparation services instead of using free services, if they want to gain access to advance loans. DETROIT FREE PRESS More W-2s to have a 16-digit code to fight tax fraud Tax filers who qualify for the Earned Income Tax Credit  risk forgoing free tax preparation services via volunteer tax assistance programs, such as those offered by AARP and the Accounting Aid Society.  In addition, the Internal Revenue Service estimates that 70% of the nation’s taxpayers are eligible for IRS Free File where software is available to those with incomes of $64,000 or less. See www.irs.gov. "A taxpayer should ask about the costs involved with their tax preparation and any related products offered so they can make informed decisions," said Marshall Hunt, certified public accountant and director of tax policy for the Accounting Aid Society's tax assistance program in Detroit. DETROIT FREE PRESS Some families can't bank on a tax refund before Feb. 27 Other potential costs: How much will it cost you to get your money via a prepaid card? While many cards offer services with no fees, review potential fees with the card, including what it would cost you to go to an ATM to get money. For example, the Jackson Hewitt product offers no-fee transactions at MoneyPass ATMs but transactions at non-MoneyPass ATMs have a $3.50 American Express Serve fee. And it's possible that the operator of the ATM you use also charges another fee. If you don't use one of these prepaid cards for two months or so, you could be hit with inactivity fees each month. Wu, of the National Consumer Law Center, says there's always a concern that unscrupulous tax preparers could pad fees to borrowers. And she warns that consumers would want to consider any hidden fees and possible add-on fees if they opted for another product, like a refund anticipation check. In some cases, advocates warned that consumers can be hit with fees of $25 to $60 for refund anticipation checks. Consumers who face delays should consider contingency plans. Prioritize paying rent and utilities. Do not expect a tax refund to arrive like it did last year to pay those bills, especially if you receive the EITC. Even with the advance loans, consumers need to realize that there are limits on how much advance cash will be available. Contact Susan Tompor: stompor@freepress.com or 313-222-8876.

Fred Katayama reports. ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript Jobs cuts looming at Wal-Mart. Sources say the world's largest retailer will announce as early as Friday that it'll lay off hundreds of people at its Arkansas headquarters. Workers afraid of losing their jobs have been flooding recruiting firms with resumes. Wal-Mart would not comment. The cuts - expected to be fewer than 500 - are a small percentage of its staff of 18,000. But it's part of CEO Doug McMillon's drive to cut costs. Wal-Mart has been increasing wages for half- a million workers at its stores. Those costs, combined with a stronger dollar, hurt its quarterly profit and forced the company to sharply cut its earnings forecast for the year. Wal-Mart is also spending more on training in its bid to improve customer service. Investors sent Wal-Mart shares lower at the start of trading. The stock has fallen nearly 25 percent this year, vastly underperforming that of its rivals, Amazon and Target.

The financials and consumer discretionary stocks were performing best among the S&P industry sectors; utilities and telecom were the laggards. The day’s economic news was mixed with retail sales up on auto and gasoline sales, business inventories were up slightly, and consumer sentiment was okay. WTI crude oil for February delivery settled at $52.37 a barrel, down about 1.3% on the day and down 3% for the week. February gold dropped 0.3% on the day to settle at $1,196.20, but up about 1.9% for the week. Equities were headed for a mixed close close shortly before the bell as the DJIA traded down 0.03% for the day, the S&P 500 traded up 0.24%, and the Nasdaq Composite traded up 0.48%. The Dow 30 stocks traded very near the break even line late in the session and the closing bell might see some shifts in which side of the line the index close on. The DJIA stock posting the largest daily percentage loss ahead of the close Friday was Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE: WMT) which traded down about 1.15% at $67.19. The stock’s 52-week range is $60.20 to $75.19. Volume was about 15% below the daily average of around 8.4 million shares. The company had now specific news, but the government report on retail sales didn’t do Wal-Mart stock any favors. United Technologies Corp. (NYSE: UTX) traded down 0.64% at $110.11. The stock’s 52-week range is $83.39 to $112.83. Volume was about 35% below the daily average of around 3.3 million shares. The industrial giant had no specific news Friday. E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Co. (NYSE: DD) traded down 0.58% at $73.68. The stock’s 52-week range is $50.88 to $75.86. Volume was less than half the daily average of around 2.8 million shares. The company had no specific news. McDonald’s Corp. (NYSE: MCD) traded down 0.52% at $121.46. The stock’s 52-week range is $110.33 to $131.96. Volume was less than half the daily average of around 4.3 million shares. The company had no specific news Friday, but investors continue to wonder about McDonald’s plan to sell big stakes in both its China and Japan operations. Of the Dow 30 stocks, 13 are on track to close higher Friday and 17 are set to close lower.

Steve and Leona Fogle have run the Fogle True Value Hardware Store for several years after buying it from the previous owners. Last fall the couple moved the business into the former Walmart store on the north end of town. “It did surprise us because we're just a married couple trying to make a living running a hardware store and never thought that we would even be up for an award,” said Steve Fogle. “We have done a lot of business with the previous owner so we kind of had an understanding of what the business was, and we thought it was a good fit for us.” Leona Fogle said the couple got the call recently one morning in their store’s office. The store has filled the space with its own products, including tools lawnmowers, and items for the home, including appliances. Two other stores are also leasing space in the store: a gun shop and a furniture store. Both businesses are owned by friends of the Fogles. “The community has had a good response, we hope to make it last and hopefully see other businesses work together and continue to grow,” said Leona. “Some other businesses now that are coinciding, if that's what it takes to help small businesses grow, I think that's a great thing.” Appanoose Development Corp. had purchased the former Walmart on auction, while looking for a new business to take the spot. “Walmart built a new building down south of here, a little larger and it's actually the highest grossing retailer for Walmart in the region, it’s been very very good for Centerville,” said Centerville Mayor Neal MacArthur. “The building was vacant about a year and a half we had three or four businesses which looked at it, but Steve's business was the best one of the bunch.” “We are honored to have clients who have worked diligently to move their businesses forward while showing a strong commitment to their communities and customers,” said Lisa Shimkat, State Director of America’s Small Business Development Center in Iowa. "We are delighted to be able to recognize their hard work and success with these awards.” The Fogles will be formally presented the award on March 14th at the State Capitol in Des Moines. 40.743212 -92.868007 Filed in: News Topics: centerville, Iowa, SBDC, Small Business Development Center Suggest a correction × Suggest A Correction Your name Your email Report a typo or grammatical error Cancel Facebook Twitter Google Email Reddit Tumblr Popular Winter Storm Could Bring Dangerous Conditions Sunday Night Des Moines Man Found in Utah Accused of Missing Woman’s Murder Homicide: Police Find Body Believed to be Missing Des Moines Woman Latest News Iowans Stock Up to Stay Away from Storm “Park, Eat, Play” Project to Combat Parking Problem in Downtown Des Moines Worried Affordable Care Act Supporters Rally Outside Courthouse Marshalltown Man Hit by Train, Killed News For a Small Electronics Business, Black Friday Just Another Day News Season of Sweet Success for Algona Shop News Small Business Saturday Opportunity for Shoppers, New Des Moines Business News Assisted Living Center Says Breach of Contract has Swiped Assistance From Elderly News Ames Aldi Relocates to Duff Avenue News Weather’s Impact on Holiday Shopping in East Village News Iowans Fighting for Minimum Wage Make Plea to Lawmakers News Ames South Duff Proposed Road Project Causing Concern News Templeton Rye Awarded $1.6 Million to Bring Operations to Iowa News Centerville Cemetery Holds History Lessons News More New Development Changing Campustown in Ames News Walmart Trims its Christmas Eve Hours News Ames Tour Encourages Awareness of Small Business Saturday Mobile Apps 13Now News App for iPhone & iPad 13Now News App for Android 13WarnMe Weather App for iPhone & iPad 13WarnMe Weather App for Android Facebook Twitter Instagram About & Contact screenertv Screener Untitled-2Covers Online Public File • Terms of Service • Privacy Policy • 1801 Grand Ave. Des Moines, IA 50309 • Copyright © 2017, WHO • A Tribune Broadcasting Station • Powered by WordPress.com VIP × Email Alerts Send to Email Address Your Name Your Email Address Cancel Post was not sent - check your email addresses!

Posted 14 Jan 2017 07:10 Updated 14 Jan 2017 07:42 Aircraft flies over a Wal-Mart billboard in Mexico City March 24, 2015. REUTERS/Edgard Garrido/File Photo Enlarge Caption  Email More A A REUTERS: Wal-Mart on Friday announced a management shuffle that integrates the running of its physical outlets and online operations, and extends broader authority to the former head of online retailer Jet.com, which Wal-Mart bought for US$3.3 billion last year. It was the second time Wal-Mart has shuffled its e-commerce decks after it acquired Jet.com in August and appointed Marc Lore to run its e-commerce business. In November, Wal-Mart announced a number of management changes and said Jet.com co-founder Nate Faust would lead fulfilment operations for both Jet.com and Wal-Mart.com. Among the changes announced on Friday, Wal-Mart said Jeremy King, who was the chief technology officer of global e-commerce for Wal-Mart Stores, will oversee the technology teams for both its brick and mortar retail stores and its e-commerce business. Michael Bender, chief operating officer for e-commerce, will leave the company. Tony Rogers, the chief marketing officer of Wal-Mart in the United States, will now also oversee online marketing efforts as the company shifts its focus to building its websites and e-commerce offerings. Wal-Mart also appointed GE Power executive Clay Johnson as the new chief information officer. Johnson will replace Karenann Terrell, who will leave in February. "These changes continue to show Lore is putting his stamp on the business," said Brian Yarbrough, senior research analyst with Edward Jones. "It remains to be seen how effective this will be." The departures are a sign that Wal-Mart's struggling online business will get a drastic makeover under Lore, who started out in e-commerce with Diapers.com, which he eventually sold to Amazon.com Inc in 2010 for US$550 million. Lore is likely to stay with Wal-Mart for at least five years, according to filings. The changes announced on Friday are also part of a broader push by Wal-Mart Chief Executive Doug McMillon to narrow the gap with Amazon and to give it an even more dominant position in U.S. e-commerce. The retailer has been investing in e-commerce for the past 15 years, but it still lags far behind its Seattle-based rival. The management changes come at a time when Wal-Mart is cutting thousands of back-office jobs in an effort to focus more on e-commerce, cut costs and have more employees on the sales floor Analysts expect such executive shuffles to continue as Wal-Mart keeps integrating Jet.com into its business. "Wal-Mart clearly isn't done reconfiguring its e-commerce operation and still has work to do," said analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research. He said a lot of companies are combining oversight of their store and online operations with the goal of having a single retail organisation, as Apple did last year. - Reuters Email More YOU MAY ALSO LIKE From Our Website From the Web Happening Now new window view more My Facebook Friends Back To Top JUMP TO Select Section Asia Pacific Singapore World Business Sport Entertainment Technology Health Lifestyle Videos Weather Photos Special Reports Archives Services PSI Navigate to: News TV Connect Watch Live GET OUR APPS iPhone/iPad Android Get Our News Facebook Twitter Linkedin YouTube Mobile SMS eNews RSS News Asia Pacific World Sport Technology Lifestyle Photos Archives Singapore Business Entertainment Health Videos Special Reports TV Live News Schedule Shows Services Weather ADVERTISE WITH US Online Mobile TV Contact Sales Channel NewsAsia Channel News Asia About Us Coverage Hotel Partners Events & Seminars Presenters & Correspondents Contact Us Mediacorp Mediacorp News Group © 2017 About Mediacorp Pte Ltd Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Back To Top

Gaming by Alina Bradford January 13, 2017 7:50 PM PST @alinabradford Up Next Nintendo's Fils-Aime: The Switch won't oust the 3DS It's a tablet, a console and a portable multiplayer tabletop game system all-in-one...and it looks pretty darn awesome. The new Nintendo Switch console follows the NES Classic and Super Mario Run in a line of products that have titillated gamers in recent months. You're probably dying to get your hands on one. Well, hold up. Here's what you need to know about snagging the magically versatile $300 (£280, AU$470) gaming system. Update, 5:41 p.m. PT: GameStop seems to be sold out online, but you may want to check with your local stores. Target shows the gray version available for preorder, but this seems to vary hour to hour.Walmart and Amazon are sold out. You can sign up for availability alerts with Amazon by clicking on the link, though. Best Buy also appears to be sold out, but says on its site that more are coming soon. We'll be updating this piece as the Switch is restocked or when new information is released, so stay tuned! 14 We finally got our hands on Nintendo's funky Switch console Where to get it You won't be able to get your hands on a Switch until March. The official release date is March 3. It will come in gray or a more colorful option with neon-blue and neon-red Joy-Con controllers. As of right now, there are several places where you can preorder the Switch. Nintendo tweeted that a limited quantity of preorders will be available Friday, January 13, at 9 a.m. ET at the Nintendo Store in New York. You can also preorder the Switch at GameStop, Amazon, Target, Walmart and Best Buy. At GameStop stores you can get up to a $75 extra credit with the trade-in of used consoles that can go toward a Switch preorder. If you want to try it out before anyone else, Nintendo is taking the Switch on the road to six North American cities. Here's where and when you can wait in line to get your hands on it: New York: Jan. 13-15 Toronto: Jan. 27-29 Washington, D.C.: Feb. 10-12 Chicago: Feb. 17-19 San Francisco: Feb. 24-26 Los Angeles: March 3-5 Don't show up on the first two days, though. The Friday and Saturday of each stop are invite-only. Each Sunday is free and open to the public and will be your best chance to try the Switch before its release date. What it will cost The Switch unit will officially cost $300, AU$470 or £280. If Nintendo restricts production, as it did with the NES Classic, you may see the Switch's price jacked up hundreds of dollars by third-party sellers when it's finally released. Nintendo says online gaming services will be free for a trial period after the console is released, but will become a subscription service this fall. The unit will come with a Switch console, two Joy-Con joysticks, two Joy-Con wrist straps, a Joy-Con Grip, the Nintendo Switch Dock, a HDMI cable and an AC adapter. (Confused? Here's more information about the new Joy-Con controllers.) The Nintendo Pro controller will be sold separately for $70 (AU$95, £60). Additional Joy-Con controllers will be sold for $80 (AU$105, £65). 23 Nintendo Switch: All the games you'll get at launch (and beyond) Games Nintendo has partnered with a lot of companies, such as Activision, EA, Capcom, Sega and Konami, in the hopes of providing a great selection of games for the Switch. The highly anticipated Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild will be a launch title. Super Mario Odyssey will be released during the holiday season of 2017. There will also be a Mario Kart Deluxe 8. Over 80 third-party games are currently in development, such as Dragon Quest Heroes 1 and 2 and Project Octopath Traveler. Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, FIFA, Xenoblade Chronicles 2 and Fire Emblem Warriors are also coming to the Switch. During the Nintendo Switch presentation, two new games were shown to highlight the HD Rumble feature in the Joy-Con controllers. 1, 2, Switch is a party game, while Arms is a boxing game. 1, 2, Switch releases on the same day as the console and Arms releases in spring 2017.

We'll be updating this piece as the Switch is restocked or when new information is released, so stay tuned! 14 We finally got our hands on Nintendo's funky Switch console Where to get it You won't be able to get your hands on a Switch until March. The official release date is March 3. It will come in gray or a more colorful option with neon-blue and neon-red Joy-Con controllers. As of right now, there are several places where you can preorder the Switch. Nintendo tweeted that a limited quantity of preorders will be available Friday, January 13, at 9 a.m. ET at the Nintendo Store in New York. You can also preorder the Switch at GameStop, Amazon, Target, Walmart and Best Buy. At GameStop stores you can get up to a $75 extra credit with the trade-in of used consoles that can go toward a Switch preorder. If you want to try it out before anyone else, Nintendo is taking the Switch on the road to six North American cities. Here's where and when you can wait in line to get your hands on it: New York: Jan. 13-15 Toronto: Jan. 27-29 Washington, D.C.: Feb. 10-12 Chicago: Feb. 17-19 San Francisco: Feb. 24-26 Los Angeles: March 3-5 Don't show up on the first two days, though. The Friday and Saturday of each stop are invite-only. Each Sunday is free and open to the public and will be your best chance to try the Switch before its release date. What it will cost The Switch unit will officially cost $300, AU$470 or £280. If Nintendo restricts production, as it did with the NES Classic, you may see the Switch's price jacked up hundreds of dollars by third-party sellers when it's finally released. Nintendo says online gaming services will be free for a trial period after the console is released, but will become a subscription service this fall. The unit will come with a Switch console, two Joy-Con joysticks, two Joy-Con wrist straps, a Joy-Con Grip, the Nintendo Switch Dock, a HDMI cable and an AC adapter. (Confused? Here's more information about the new Joy-Con controllers.) The Nintendo Pro controller will be sold separately for $70 (AU$95, £60). Additional Joy-Con controllers will be sold for $80 (AU$105, £65). 23 Nintendo Switch: All the games you'll get at launch (and beyond) Games Nintendo has partnered with a lot of companies, such as Activision, EA, Capcom, Sega and Konami, in the hopes of providing a great selection of games for the Switch. The highly anticipated Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild will be a launch title. Super Mario Odyssey will be released during the holiday season of 2017. There will also be a Mario Kart Deluxe 8. Over 80 third-party games are currently in development, such as Dragon Quest Heroes 1 and 2 and Project Octopath Traveler. Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, FIFA, Xenoblade Chronicles 2 and Fire Emblem Warriors are also coming to the Switch. During the Nintendo Switch presentation, two new games were shown to highlight the HD Rumble feature in the Joy-Con controllers. 1, 2, Switch is a party game, while Arms is a boxing game. 1, 2, Switch releases on the same day as the console and Arms releases in spring 2017.

REUTERS/Edgard Garrido/File Photo Wal-Mart Stores Inc on Friday announced a management shuffle that integrates the running of its physical outlets and online operations, and extends broader authority to the former head of online retailer Jet.com, which Wal-Mart bought for $3.3 billion last year. It was the second time Wal-Mart has shuffled its e-commerce decks after it acquired Jet.com in August and appointed Marc Lore to run its e-commerce business. In November, Wal-Mart announced a number of management changes and said Jet.com co-founder Nate Faust would lead fulfillment operations for both Jet.com and Wal-Mart.com. Among the changes announced on Friday, Wal-Mart said Jeremy King, who was the chief technology officer of global e-commerce for Wal-Mart Stores, will oversee the technology teams for both its brick and mortar retail stores and its e-commerce business. Michael Bender, chief operating officer for e-commerce, will leave the company. Tony Rogers, the chief marketing officer of Wal-Mart in the United States, will now also oversee online marketing efforts as the company shifts its focus to building its websites and e-commerce offerings. Wal-Mart also appointed GE Power executive Clay Johnson as the new chief information officer. Johnson will replace Karenann Terrell, who will leave in February. "These changes continue to show Lore is putting his stamp on the business," said Brian Yarbrough, senior research analyst with Edward Jones. "It remains to be seen how effective this will be." The departures are a sign that Wal-Mart's struggling online business will get a drastic makeover under Lore, who started out in e-commerce with Diapers.com, which he eventually sold to Amazon.com Inc in 2010 for $550 million. Lore is likely to stay with Wal-Mart for at least five years, according to filings. The changes announced on Friday are also part of a broader push by Wal-Mart Chief Executive Doug McMillon to narrow the gap with Amazon and to give it an even more dominant position in U.S. e-commerce. The retailer has been investing in e-commerce for the past 15 years, but it still lags far behind its Seattle-based rival. The management changes come at a time when Wal-Mart is cutting thousands of back-office jobs in an effort to focus more on e-commerce, cut costs and have more employees on the sales floor Analysts expect such executive shuffles to continue as Wal-Mart keeps integrating Jet.com into its business. "Wal-Mart clearly isn't done reconfiguring its e-commerce operation and still has work to do," said analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research. He said a lot of companies are combining oversight of their store and online operations with the goal of having a single retail organization, as Apple Inc did last year.

Corporate, civic and faith-based groups from North Carolina to California have committed to packaging meals to support Stop Hunger Now’s mission of working to end hunger in our lifetime.

Over 600 FedEx employees will be packaging meals simultaneously in these cities: Memphis, Atlanta, Washington, D.C., Newark, N.J., Boston, Los Angeles, Pittsburgh, Indianapolis, Houston, Orlando and San Francisco. In addition, FedEx has provided a $30,000 grant to subsidize shipping costs. The meals packaged by FedEx employees will be shipped to partners in Zambia, Haiti, and Vietnam. “FedEx is proud to again mark Dr. King’s birthday by supporting Stop Hunger Now,” said Rose Flenorl, manager, FedEx Global Citizenship. “Our team members are committed to making an impact in communities where we live and work, and by supporting this cause we can help to perpetuate corporate and societal values that are consistent with Dr. King’s vision of America.” Other corporations and groups packaging meals include: –Walmart Global eCommerce, packaging more than 20,000 meals in the California Bay Area –Turner Broadcasting in Atlanta, packaging more than 40,000 meals. –United Methodist Churches in Virginia, Tennessee, New Jersey and North Carolina are participating in meal packaging events. –Schools and universities involved include Wake Tech Community College in Raleigh, N.C.; Haverford Middle School in Haverton, Pa.; St. Andrew School in Newtown, Pa. and Shenandoah University in Winchester, Va. –In Richmond, Va., the Church Hill Rotary Club plans to package about 2,000 meals.

News Can’t Pre-Order Nintendo Switch Online? Do it the Old Fashioned Way at Walmart Share Tweet by Al McCarthy on January 13, 2017 Ever since the Nintendo Switch has been available for pre-order, online retailers have been selling out left and right.  The usual suspects, Amazon, Best Buy, Gamestop and others are closing pre-orders just as fast as they open them, but apparently Walmart will allow you to pre-order the console in person. If you go to a Walmart in person and pre-order the Nintendo Switch you’ll be guaranteed a console on launch day, according to contact we had with the PR for the retailer. They claim that pre-ordering the Nintendo Switch using this method will require that you put 10% of the purchase price down on the console, and that you’ll need to use the Pickup desk in-store. These pre-orders are also available only while supplies last. Sure, it’s not as convenient as sitting at the computer and waiting for a package to arrive at your doorstep, but it will guarantee that you have a console on launch day. We didn’t believe it either, but reconfirming this news with the PR company and then calling into our local Walmart and speaking with a representative at the Pickup desk this does indeed seem to be the case. If you’re having trouble online, head on down to your local Walmart if you want a Nintendo Switch on Launch Day. Calling All Writers: Become a contributor and write about games at AOTF!

(Reena Rose Sibayan | The Jersey Journal) Print Email Corey McDonald | The Jersey Journal By Corey McDonald | The Jersey Journal The Jersey Journal on January 13, 2017 at 11:56 AM, updated January 13, 2017 at 12:04 PM comments SECAUCUS - With the New Year comes more shoplifting arrests at the Walmart superstore. Two people were arrested and charged with shoplifting and drug charges within a two-day span last week, according to police Capt. Dennis Miller. On Jan. 2 at 7:45 p.m., Zachary Gogolen, a resident of Montclair, was arrested and charged after he ran out of the store with $213 worth of miscellaneous items, Miller said. The 36-year-old ran through the Park Plaza Drive parking lot and across the street to the Buffalo Wild Wings, where he was stopped by officers who had received a call from Walmart's loss prevention staff, Miller said.  After conducting a search, police found phone accessories, speakers, and 5-Hour Energy drinks that were stolen from the store. They also found two bags of marijuana, a glass pipe, and a hypodermic needle, according to Miller. Gogolen was charged with shoplifting, possession of marijuana, and possession of drug paraphernalia. At 8 p.m. the next day, Secaucus police received a call that 27-year-old Ghasan Abdallah was stopped by loss prevention after attempting to walk out of the store with $673.15 worth of merchandise, according to Miller. "(Abdallah) was seen by loss prevention selecting electronic equipment and clothing in the store, placing it in his shopping cart, and then proceeding to walk past all points of sale and out of the store," Miller said. The Paterson resident was arrested and police discovered he had seven different warrants out for his arrest, totaling $6,250, out of various towns across New Jersey including Clifton, Oakland, Teterboro, and Paramus, Miller said. He was also found to have Oxycodone and Suboxone, a drug used to treat those who are dependent on opiods. He was charged with shoplifting and three counts of drug possession.

Police have been hunting for Markeith Loyd, 41, since the Monday morning attack on Master Sgt. Debra Clayton. Officials said Thursday that they found Loyd’s pants and shirt, which showed evidence that the 17-year force veteran returned fire, hitting the suspect in the chest — but he was protected by the body armor. The on-the-run suspect is considered armed and dangerous, Orlando Police Chief John Mina said. “He's already shown that he's willing to gun down a police officer and continue to shoot that police officer even after (she was) defenseless, so that information is vital when officers go arrest him because they want to go home to their families," he said late Thursday night, according to the Orlando Sentinel. Girlfriend of accused cop shooter joked about him killing police Loyd is also wanted for murder in the December shooting death of his pregnant girlfriend. Clayton was on duty and in uniform Monday when she recognized Loyd as a suspect in that case and approached him in front of a Walmart, police said. Police are hunting for Markeith Loyd. (HANDOUT/AFP/Getty Images) When she told the fleeing suspect to stop, he opened fire, police said. Amid the manhunt, police arrested three people accused of helping Loyd hide in the weeks following his girlfriend’s death. Loyd's niece, Lakensha Smith-Loyd, and his ex-girlfriend, Jameis Slaughter, were charged Wednesday with accessory after the fact to murder for keeping in contact with Loyd and delivering money to him. Zarghee Mayan, a former coworker of Loyd's at a fried-chicken restaurant, was arrested on the same charge Tuesday after prosecutors alleged he gave the fugitive food and cash. Reward in Debra Clayton Orlando cop killing raised to $100,000 None of the three have cooperated with police, Mina said. Orlando Master Sgt. Debra Clayton was shot and killed Monday. (@OrlandoPolice via Twitter) "If there is anyone who is harboring, aiding, abetting him in any way, they will be arrested as we've seen with the past three arrests," he said. Police have searched nearly 100 locations since the Monday shooting, and have received over 800 tips. The Monday manhunt was the highest profile, with officers going door to door through an apartment complex. Two officers were involved in motorcycle accidents during the hunt, including Deputy First Class Norman Lewis, who died when he was thrown from his.

The surveillance footage, released by the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office on Wednesday, shows Michael Foster, 43, tackling Clarence Daniels from behind as he was walking into a Brandon, Fla. Wal-Mart on Tuesday. Foster followed Daniels into the store after seeing him exiting his vehicle with a gun holstered under his shirt — which was perfectly legal for the 62-year-old Daniels to do since he holds a concealed weapon license. Nevertheless, Foster tackled Daniels from behind as he entered the store, and put him in a chokehold before taking him to the ground. Witnesses said that Foster yelled out that Daniels had a gun. They also said that Daniels yelled out that he had a license for it. Foster called 911 only after he tackled accosted Daniels. He was arrested and charged with battery.

Raiders Of The Lost Walmart Unearth $150 Camera From 2006, Ancient Overpriced Hard Drive Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Raiders Of The Lost Walmart Unearth $150 Camera From 2006, Ancient Overpriced Hard Drive January 13, 2017 10:37 am EST By Laura Northrup@lnorthrup raiders of the lost walmart cameras pentax seagate external hard drives The Raiders of the Lost Walmart are the brave band of retail archaeologists who comb through the electronics sections of big-box stores to find gadgets that are obsolete or just plain old, and also comically overpriced. In this week’s field reports: an external hard drive and a digital camera that are over a decade old, yet priced as if they’re new. Both items came from Walmart. First up, a Seagate external drive with an 80 GB capacity, for a low, low price of $68. You could buy this bulky relic, or you could spend $10 less and get a one-terabyte hard drive from Seagate that weighs five ounces. Up to you. Reader Colter found this hot digital camera on the shelf at his local Walmart. “Initial search brought up its unveiling… At CES 2006,” Colter writes. Indeed, the product debuted at the electronics trade show at the beginning of 2006, and you can buy a working camera from eBay for as little as $5. At least Walmart has this camera protected against theft.

U.S. District Judge Steven McAuliffe also asked the New Hampshire Supreme Court to advise whether the plaintiff Maureen McPadden was entitled under state law to any of the $15 million of “enhanced” damages that comprised most of the award. Though “reasonable minds can differ,” Wal-Mart “asserts – not implausibly” that such damages are not available, the Concord, N.H., judge wrote on Jan. 6. Wal-Mart considers the damages award “improper,” spokesman Randy Hargrove said in an email. “We look forward to the New Hampshire Supreme Court’s determination.” The Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer has said it does not tolerate discrimination. McPadden accused the world’s largest retailer of using her loss of a pharmacy key as a pretext for her November 2012 dismissal from a store in Seabrook, N.H., after more than 13 years at the retailer. She said Wal-Mart actually fired her in retaliation for her raising concerns about whether prescriptions were being filled properly. McPadden also said her gender played a role, saying a male pharmacist who later lost his key was not fired. Jurors originally awarded McPadden $31.22 million, a sum that McAuliffe said was “to say the least, startling.” As required by federal law, the judge later reduced the punitive damages component, to $300,000 from $15 million, and in a Jan. 5 order said McPadden deserved just $111,591 of front pay, one-fifth what the jury had awarded. Wal-Mart had sought to overturn the entire verdict, but McAuliffe rejected that request in September. Rick Fradette, a lawyer for McPadden, said that if enhanced damages were ever warranted, “it is where the world’s largest private employer continues to discriminate against women in the 21st century. “Wal-Mart’s posture has been that it will fight this to the end,” he said. “We’ll see what the New Hampshire Supreme Court has to say.” The case is McPadden v. Wal-Mart Stores East LP, U.S. District Court, District of New Hampshire, No. 14-00475. (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Richard Chang) Copyright 2017 Reuters.

(WVVA) The Beckley Walmart on Eisenhower Drive will start closing overnight beginning on Saturday, January 28, 2017.  At that time, the store will no longer be open from midnight to 6 a.m. each week. A representative with the MacArthur Walmart said their store will continue to serve customers 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  At this point, it is unclear how many workers will be laid off as a result of the reduced hours. The company rolled out a new system for scheduling workers at 650 stores across the U.S. last July. The goal was to improve staffing and levels during peak shopping times.  The decision comes after Walmart was ousted last year as West Virginia's biggest employer by West Virginia United Health System.    NEWSMore>> Mercer County Superintendent encourages students to consider secondary education careers Mercer County Superintendent encourages students to consider secondary education careers Molding the minds of the future it's can be a daunting task.

(REUTERS/Rebecca Cook)    4443001 Video footage taken from a Florida Wal-Mart shows a shopper literally jumping the gun. The surveillance footage, released by the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office on Wednesday, shows Michael Foster, 43, tackling Clarence Daniels from behind as he was walking into a Brandon, Fla. Wal-Mart on Tuesday. Foster followed Daniels into the store after seeing him exiting his vehicle with a gun holstered under his shirt — which was perfectly legal for the 62-year-old Daniels to do since he holds a concealed weapon license. Nevertheless, Foster tackled Daniels from behind as he entered the store, and put him in a chokehold before taking him to the ground. Witnesses said that Foster yelled out that Daniels had a gun. They also said that Daniels yelled out that he had a license for it. Foster called 911 only after he tackled accosted Daniels. He was arrested and charged with battery.

According to Reuters, customs spokesman Huang Songping said China is the biggest loser in the anti-globalization trend. He added it will be difficult for China's foreign trade to improve in 2017 due to rising costs and other factors. China is the world's largest trading nation. It could be heavily exposed to protectionist measures this year if Trump follows through on campaign pledges to brand it a currency manipulator and impose heavy tariffs on imports of Chinese goods.

Lowe's workforce totals more than 285,000. As part of the reshuffling, Lowe's is shifting the roles and responsibilities for some of its staff and eliminating some jobs, this person said. Some of the affected workers will be shifted to new roles at the company, and others will be promoted. However, a portion will be laid off as the company consolidates some positions, the person explained. The new staffing model will be implemented nationwide and is aimed at freeing up resources to boost face time with customers as Lowe's adapts to evolving customer needs. In a statement, Lowe's said, "While we have no announcements to share, we continually evaluate our staffing model to ensure we have the resources in place to serve customers' evolving expectations and their home improvement needs." The layoffs are just the latest to hit the retail landscape. Earlier this week, Wal-Mart (WMT) said it would be slashing hundreds of jobs with many of the cuts impacting its human resources department. In September, Wal-mart said it would cut 7,000 back-office jobs. Meanwhile last week, The Limited announced it would be closing all of its stores. In recent calls with investors, Lowe's has stressed its attempts to improve productivity — a goal that the new model is aimed at meeting. As part of its efforts to improve customers' experience, Lowe's is doubling down on its strategy to cater to shoppers both in store and online. In December, Lowe's detailed its plans for about $3.6 billion in capital expenditures from 2017 to 2019. About 45 percent of this spending will go toward this strategy, including new stores and technology investments. Lowe's also plans to add 15 to 20 stores per year across North America for the next three years. In the U.S., these new stores will result in 4,000 to 5,000 new jobs over the course of this period. Home improvement retail has been a bright spot for the struggling retail landscape as rising home prices and an improving consumer backdrop have prompted customers to spend more on home improvement projects. Overall retail though has struggled amid fierce competition from online retailers and cost-cutting measures as companies double down on other initiatives, such as e-commerce. Same-store sales at Lowe's have been positive for 14 straight quarters — a rare track record for a retailer. Still, Lowe's growth has lagged that of rival Home Depot's (HD) for six of the past eight quarters, according to FactSet data. During the past year, Lowe's shares have shrunk 2.5 percent while Home Depot shares have risen 5.9 percent.

Prior to the spree, the 33-year-old offender had just one entry on her criminal record. "Your behaviour in the last number of months, I guess, is a clear demonstration of the traumatic impact that an addiction to crystal meth can have on someone," Judge John Combs said. Rashelle Kristen Studer pleaded guilty on Thursday to thefts from six different Brandon stores between Aug. 8 and Sept. 1. She also admitted to attending Walmart three times between Dec. 6 and Jan. 7 while banned from the store for a previous theft, and to possessing a TV stolen from that business. In August, she and another woman stole $400 worth of clothes from Wheatcity Cowtown, and they stole a $130 boxed security camera from Extreme Electronics. On another occasion, cosmetics and an LCD TV were among the items she tried to steal from Real Canadian Superstore, but she got caught and those items were recovered. A $23 bottle of vodka was the item she stole from the Liquor Mart on Victoria Avenue later that month. Smitten Adult Boutique was her target on Aug. 26. That time she took two items worth $118, although the Crown attorney didn’t specify in court what they were. Studer was involved in an attempt to make off with a cartload of $730 in merchandise from Walmart on Sept 1. She was banned from being there on Jan. 7 when a man she was with stole a TV. Walmart staff had spotted her, and her movements and those of her co-accused were captured on camera. Studer answered the door when police later knocked at her home, and the officer could see the stolen TV leaning against the wall with the security tag still attached. Crown attorney Yaso Mathu told court the offences were the result of Studer’s addiction to crystal meth. Studer wiped tears from her eyes as she apologized: "I’m sorry for everything I’ve done." Combs sentenced Studer to three months house arrest followed by 18 months probation. She’s also to pay $678 for the goods that weren’t recovered from the thefts at Cowtown, Extreme, the Liquor Mart and Smitten. Cocaine, marijuana and ecstasy have been common drugs used in Brandon, but the use of crystal meth has been noted more often in court in recent years. » ihitchen@brandonsun.com » Twitter: IanHitchen Republished from the Brandon Sun print edition January 13, 2017 Print E–mail Tweet Report Error Rate this This article has not yet been rated.

News The First Nintendo Switch Pre-Orders In The US Have Already Sold Out Share Tweet by Dean James on January 12, 2017 The Nintendo Switch was officially revealed to be coming on March 3 during the much awaited presentation earlier tonight. During that showcase, it was stated that pre-orders for the Switch were going to be starting in Japan on January 21, but nothing was mentioned for the rest of the world. However, now the first retailer to have pre-orders go up has done so and in only a few minutes they have evidently sold out. For those looking to pre-order the Nintendo Switch, you definitely want to keep an eye on Walmart’s website. The listing for the Switch went up just a few minutes ago and in no time they already sold out. This is no big surprise after we saw how the NES Classic Edition sold out everywhere in seconds, with Walmart being one of the worst culprits with that. This could be a case where Walmart is going to put up pre-orders in waves though, so as we said above definitely keep checking to see if they go up again. Also as a tip, check the website from desktop, the mobile website, and the mobile app, as sometimes you will have better luck on one versus the other. Hopefully this isn’t a sign of things to come like with the NES Classic and the early amiibo, but we’ll just have to wait and see. Stay tuned for details on others as they come out as well.

(WQAD) × Police Chase Leads to Evacuation of Clinton County Walmart Jacob Dau. (WQAD) CLINTON, Iowa  —  A police chase through Clinton prompted a lock-down at the local Walmart on Thursday. Police 35-year-old Jacob Dau tried fleeing from agents with the Division of Criminal Investigation at the Wild Rose Casino before going through a cemetery and eventually running into a Walmart on South 25th Street. Customers and employees were evacuated from the building. Dau was later found in a sales bin and taken to the Clinton County Jail, where charges are pending. “We had very good communication amongst the inside, the outside and all the agencies, and we all knew what every other person was doing, which shows by the positive result we had,” says Clinton Police Department Captain Steven Kopp. “A wanted subject was taken into custody without any harm to the business–structure-wise–or employees, or customers. It was a good result.” Initial reports indicated Dau was armed with a handgun, but officials do not believe the gun ever entered the store. Nobody was hurt during the incident. 41.818815 -90.242945 Related stories Juveniles in Police Custody Following Foot Chase Overnight Chase Leads Police Across Town Des Moines Police Led on Car Chase Thursday Morning Filed in: News Topics: Clinton County, Walmart Suggest a correction × Suggest A Correction Your name Your email Report a typo or grammatical error Cancel Facebook Twitter Google Email Reddit Tumblr Channel 13 is on Instagram!

Nintendo Switch. Source: 2016 Nintendo The new machine, a tablet-sized device with wireless controllers that can be used anywhere but also connects to TVs, will go on sale March 3 at a price of $300, with a brand-new Zelda game as its launch title. None of that, however, was enough to convince investors that it will be a big moneymaker for the Kyoto-based company, whose shares fell 5.8 percent to 23,750 yen after Nintendo executives held a presentation in Tokyo on Friday. Nintendo is counting on the Switch to end years of pain at its console division, which released a successor to the popular Wii in 2012, only to see it flop. After shunning the smartphone market for years, its long-awaited foray into smartphone gaming got off to a rough start, with last month’s  disappointing debut of Super Mario Run. With Switch, there isn’t any single distinguishing feature -- like the Wii’s motion controllers when that machine debuted a decade ago -- likely to lure buyers for the new console and its games. That’s fueling concerns Nintendo may be losing its ability to deliver hit entertainment products. “The pricing and game titles were as expected; the stock was bought up on hopes and sold on the fact,” said Hideki Yasuda, an analyst at Ace Research Institute. “The first two weeks of sales will be critical for Nintendo, and they will have to sell the 2 million units they forecast for the quarter. The Switch’s success will be determined at the start.” Read more on our LIVE BLOG here Switch surpassed most analysts’ estimates of a price between $250 and $280. At $300, the Switch would cost more than Sony Corp.’s $260 PlayStation 4 and Microsoft Corp.’s $240 Xbox One, based on current U.S. retail pricing. An early leak of the price in Canada triggered a decline in Nintendo shares hours before Friday’s presentation. Nintendo also introduced one new feature for the Switch: an online gaming network. While details were scarce, the company said it would let people play with friends and chat online. The service will initially be free from March, and become a paid service later in the year. While the connectivity is new for Nintendo, the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 console have had the feature for years. “Charging for its online services is hardly surprising, but I’ll be curious to see if Nintendo can justify it,” said Jim Sterling, founder of the influential gaming blog The Jimquisition.

You will now receive the Game Plan newsletter For new games, Nintendo also introduced a new Mario game called Super Mario Odyssey as well as Splatoon 2, a successor to the popular paint-throwing game. Another new title called Arms was introduced, designed to work with the Switch’s new Joy-Con motion-sensing controllers. While the controllers pack more features and sensors, allowing for new ways to play games, they are essentially upgrades of Wii’s motion controllers. It’s critical to have a lineup of compelling games that have broad appeal -- including sports, first-person shooter, role-playing and puzzles -- at the launch because that drives sales of new consoles. The Switch, however, will have less than a dozen titles when it goes on sale, half what Wii U had when it debuted. In terms of battery life, Nintendo said the Switch will provide 2.5 to 6 hours of gameplay. Nintendo’s promise of delivering high-end graphics in a portable package also rests largely on its ability to maximize battery life. “Our biggest concern is battery life, which we think will remain an issue,” Macquarie Securities said. As a portable gadget, the device sports a screen, attachable joysticks and battery. Nintendo is betting that the ability to play the same titles indoors and outdoors will appeal to gamers who now play one set of games at home and a different collection on their smartphones when out and about. Still, that means the Switch will have to compete with smartphones, which most people already own and use. It’s unclear if consumers will want to carry another bulky device when smartphones already fill their spare moments with millions of games, apps and videos. “There is a possibility that this proposed new game playing experience will not immediately be understood,” Takeshi Koyama, an analyst at Mizuho Financial Group Inc., wrote in a report last week. Since its Wii peak about a decade ago, Nintendo shares have slumped by about two-thirds, losing more than $50 billion in market value. In October, Kimishima told Bloomberg the Switch will play a central role in restoring operating profits to a level of around 100 billion yen per year.

Through Jet they also now have Hayneedle, an online home furnishings business, again another e-commerce vertical that is not core to their own business,” said Sodero, who added that as a computer scientist and former logistics entrepreneur he struggles to follow the logic of such vertical moves. He said a central message from the retail giant has been about simplification, but from the recent shopping spree it looks as if the business is getting more complicated. “Do they plan to integrate these businesses, if so, it won’t be an easy task. Geographically there are challenges, culturally there are challenges and the business models themselves are fundamentally different. It is true Wal-Mart will need to grow its expertise and market share through acquisition to catch up to Amazon and Alibaba, but the recent deals don’t really add to market share. In fact it looks kind of like Wal-Mart is building a Frankenstein,” Sodero said. He acknowledged that Wal-Mart wants to become more like a technology company, given its biggest competitor Amazon is a technology company. He said Amazon’s ability to create solutions it sees for future retail challenges is a big advantage. He credits Wal-Mart with doing a respectable job in building its tech shop in San Bruno, Calif., but said recruiting and retaining the top talent is a challenge even for Wal-Mart because Google, Apple and a dozen other tech giants are vying for the same talent. “It will be interesting to see what Marc Lore (CEO of Jet.com, and now CEO of Wal-Mart Global eCommerce) can accomplish in the roughly 4.5 years that he remains under contract with Wal-Mart. The clock is already ticking down,” Sodero said. He said Lore is the main reason Wal-Mart acquired Jet, but five years can seem like a lifetime for an entrepreneur to work for a giant corporation. The Business Insider recently reported that Wal-Mart could be poised for a digital shopping spree as it seeks to grow its online sales globally. Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon has said the basket economics built into Jet’s operations were what attracted him to the deal. McMillon loved the Jet basket feature that allows customers to control the pricing based on delivery options and the number of items purchased. Analysts have wondered just how that will would work at Wal-Mart given that suppliers are already giving the retailer the lowest possible price. Slice Intelligence reports that Jet, even with that service, still struggles to get repeat customers. Sodero said there are other startup technology companies that might make more sense as acquisitions for Wal-Mart, more so than another vertical e-commerce business. He wonders if Wal-Mart will harken back to the early years of WalmartLabs when true tech companies were the target acquisitions. Under the leadership of then Wal-Mart Global eCommerce CEO Neil Ashe, the retailer made several acquisitions of small startups such as Kosmix for its social media genome capabilities. Grabble, whose technology scans receipts and keeps a database of a buyer’s purchase history was also acquired in 2012. The next year Wal-Mart acquired OneOps to help the retailer accelerate private cloud infrastructure strategies. Software developer Tasty Labs was also acquired at the same time. In 2014 Wal-Mart acquired Adchemy, a product search startup, and Sylir, a fashion finding app that helps consumers find clothes they like in nearby stores and then flip through the racks via their phone app. Ashe said many of the earlier acquisitions were about getting the tech talent to put their efforts to work solving challenges for Walmart’s e-commerce business. Some analysts suggest Wal-Mart and the rest of brick and mortar retailers must invest heavily in infrastructure and talent if they want to be around in the next five years. Macy’s, JC Penney, Kohl’s, Sears and Wal-Mart have all recently confirmed they are reducing store count in order to invest more into online operations. Nordstrom and Home Depot are also planning to allocate more of their capital expenditures to growing online. Sodero, a native of Brazil, has lived in the United Kingdom as well as South America for extended times. He said the United States is woefully behind in how retailers are integrating technology into shopping and every other aspect of life. “In the UK the trashcans talk to you when you pass by. They can also scan your credit cards in the wallet and read your driver’s license and call you by name. Grocery retailers have been delivering groceries bought online for nearly 20 years there. Augmented reality was used by Tesco … two years ago in South Korea to sell groceries in a busy train station,” Sodero said. “The technology is available to shift a majority of retail online in the next few years. Retailers like Wal-Mart know this and they are trying hard to turn their massive ship.” Comments comments Previous post Gov.

Crews responded to the Walmart in the 6200 block of College Drive about 1:10 p.m., and found the smell originated in a heating unit on the store's roof, the release said.  Everyone was evacuated by the time crews arrived, and no one was injured, the release said.

(Joe Burbank/Orlando Sentinel via AP) By MIKE SCHNEIDER The Associated Press ORLANDO, Fla. — A fugitive who is the focus of a four-day manhunt was wearing a bulletproof vest when he fatally shot an Orlando police sergeant earlier this week, Orlando's police chief said Thursday. Investigators found clothing belonging to 41-year-old Markeith Loyd that suggests Master Sgt. Debra Clayton returned fire after she was shot, but that a bulletproof vest protected the suspect, Orlando Police Chief John Mina said. Clayton was killed Monday morning after approaching Loyd in the parking lot of a Wal-Mart store. He was wanted at the time for the murder of his pregnant ex-girlfriend in mid-December. The fugitive shot Clayton several times, even when she was on the ground, the chief said. Police arrested a former supervisor at the fried-chicken restaurant where Loyd worked, an ex-girlfriend and a niece on Tuesday and Wednesday on charges of helping him in the weeks after Loyd's ex-girlfriend was fatally shot. Mina said they haven't been cooperative in locating him. "If there is anyone who is harboring, aiding, abetting him in any way, they will be arrested as we've seen with the past three arrests," Mina said. Hundreds of deputies and officers have searched almost 100 places since Monday, and they've received more than 800 tips. The searches have been lower-profile compared to Monday's door-to-door search of an Orlando apartment complex, and searchers have cast a broader net in central Florida, Mina said. The crime-tip service Crimeline is offering a $100,000 reward for a tip that leads to Loyd's arrest. "Anybody who makes a phone call is valuable to us at this point," said Barb Bergin, the local Crimeline's executive director. After Clayton was shot, many of her colleagues immediately joined the pursuit. Among them was sheriff's Deputy First Class Norman Lewis, who died when he was thrown from his motorcycle in an accident. Funerals were planned for Lewis for Friday and Clayton for Saturday.

The surveillance footage, released by the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office on Wednesday, shows Michael Foster, 43, tackling Clarence Daniels from behind as he was walking into a Brandon, Fla. Wal-Mart on Tuesday. Foster followed Daniels into the store after seeing him exiting his vehicle with a gun holstered under his shirt — which was perfectly legal for the 62-year-old Daniels to do since he holds a concealed weapon license. Nevertheless, Foster tackled Daniels from behind as he entered the store, and put him in a chokehold before taking him to the ground. Witnesses said that Foster yelled out that Daniels had a gun. They also said that Daniels yelled out that he had a license for it. Foster called 911 only after he tackled accosted Daniels. He was arrested and charged with battery.

Menu Home Local News Business Health Community Schools Sports Voices Bill Rauch Lee Scott What 2 Do Calendar Contact Full Issues Go Bringing Our Community Together City to annex golf course, Lady’s Island businesses Published on January 12, 2017 in Voices by The Island News By the Lady’s Island Business and Professional Association Just before Christmas, the city of Beaufort announced that it was annexing Secession Golf Course on Gibbs Island. The annexation consists of a club house, golf course, 15 member-owned cottages and 30 vacant residential lots. Also to be annexed are 10 businesses along Sea Island Parkway. The businesses include two banks (Wells Fargo and CBC National), the Filling Station, Butler Marine, a Shell gas station, the former movie theater adjacent to the high school, Zippy Lube, a dentist office, the Packing Shed (next to the Walmart site), and across the street, the property at the intersection of Lost Island Road and the Sea Island Parkway (the Dive Shop). These annexations will be open to public comment at 7 p.m. Tuesday, Jan. 24, in the Beaufort City Council chamber at Beaufort City Hall. Are these annexations good or bad for the Lady’s Island community or do they make any real difference? Before answering the question of how the proposed annexation affects Lady’s Island, a bit of history is in order. The city of Beaufort has been annexing property on Lady’s Island for a good number of years. For example, in 1999 it initiated annexation of Cane Island. It announced the proposed annexation on a Monday and on Tuesday the City Council took the first vote on the matter, causing a great deal of animosity between Beaufort County and the city. The annexation of Cane Island led to annexation of a portion of Distant Island and eventually the present Walmart site. Since the Cane Island annexation, Beaufort has annexed other properties in the Lady’s Island Village Center. In an effort to reduce animosity over annexation between the county and the northern municipalities, the Northern Regional Plan was developed. One of the key things the plan accomplished was the establishment of municipal growth boundaries in which annexation by municipalities was authorized. Lady’s Island is within the city of Beaufort’s growth boundary and thus annexation of property on the island is proper and legal. The present city administration prefers to annex only commercial property, but this could change with another administration. The recently announced annexations will increase the number of Lady’s Island businesses within the city of Beaufort. The relationship between the county, Lady’s Island and the city of Beaufort has significantly improved since 1999. Whether the proposed annexations are good or bad for Lady’s Island depends on the attitude of the city of Beaufort in regard to provision of services. If, in spite of not every business choosing to be in the city, the city takes the high road and cleans the streets and sidewalks, increases the level of police presence, considers traffic impacts of its actions and plans for a general upgrade of the commercial portion of Sea Island Parkway, it will be a very good thing. Beaufort County is not organized to provide municipal services of this type and is not going to provide them. If, on the other hand, Lady’s Island is looked at simply as a source of revenue for the city of Beaufort, there is no benefit to the community in general from the additional annexations. Time will tell. Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

(AP) — A fugitive who is the focus of a four-day manhunt was wearing a bulletproof vest when he fatally shot an Orlando police sergeant earlier this week, Orlando's police chief said Thursday. Investigators found clothing belonging to 41-year-old Markeith Loyd that suggests Master Sgt. Debra Clayton returned fire after she was shot, but that a bulletproof vest protected the suspect, Orlando Police Chief John Mina said. Clayton was killed Monday morning after approaching Loyd in the parking lot of a Wal-Mart store. He was wanted at the time for the murder of his pregnant ex-girlfriend in mid-December. FILE - This undated photo provided by the Orlando Police Department shows Markeith Loyd. Loyd is wanted for killing an Orlando police officer outside a Wal-Mart in Orlando, Fla., Monday, Jan. 9, 2017. (Orlando Police Department via AP, File) The fugitive shot Clayton several times, even when she was on the ground, the chief said. Police arrested a former supervisor at the fried-chicken restaurant where Loyd worked, an ex-girlfriend and a niece on Tuesday and Wednesday on charges of helping him in the weeks after Loyd's ex-girlfriend was fatally shot. Mina said they haven't been cooperative in locating him. "If there is anyone who is harboring, aiding, abetting him in any way, they will be arrested as we've seen with the past three arrests," Mina said. Hundreds of deputies and officers have searched almost 100 places since Monday, and they've received more than 800 tips. The searches have been lower-profile compared to Monday's door-to-door search of an Orlando apartment complex, and searchers have cast a broader net in central Florida, Mina said. The crime-tip service Crimeline is offering a $100,000 reward for a tip that leads to Loyd's arrest. "Anybody who makes a phone call is valuable to us at this point," said Barb Bergin, the local Crimeline's executive director. After Clayton was shot, many of her colleagues immediately joined the pursuit. Among them was sheriff's Deputy First Class Norman Lewis, who died when he was thrown from his motorcycle in an accident. Funerals were planned for Lewis for Friday and Clayton for Saturday.

(NYSE:WMT) from a hold rating to a sell rating in a report released on Wednesday morning. According to Zacks, “Though share price of Wal-Mart has been rising since past one year, the company is facing a number of headwinds currently. While Wal-Mart posted positive earnings streak for the fifth consecutive quarter, top-line remains sluggish possibly due to deflationary pressure hurting comparable store sales. We are encouraged that the company is focusing on building its e-commerce capabilities, foraying into new markets, expanding product assortments and implementing innovative ways to drive traffic. The recent acquisition of ShoeBuy is in-line with the company’s efforts to grow its online activities. However, unfavorable currency and higher investments in wages and e-commerce activities are also taking a toll on the profits. Decline in international revenues, stiff competition from both brick & mortar and online retailers also poses concern.” A number of other research analysts have also weighed in on WMT. Robert W. Baird set a $80.00 price objective on Wal-Mart Stores and gave the company a buy rating in a report on Saturday, November 19th.

BMO Capital Markets restated a sell rating and issued a $63.00 price objective on shares of Wal-Mart Stores in a report on Friday, November 4th. Finally, Cowen and Company restated an outperform rating on shares of Wal-Mart Stores in a report on Wednesday, December 28th. Four investment analysts have rated the stock with a sell rating, eighteen have issued a hold rating and nine have issued a buy rating to the company. Wal-Mart Stores currently has an average rating of Hold and a consensus price target of $75.30.

The surveillance footage, released by the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office on Wednesday, shows Michael Foster, 43, tackling Clarence Daniels from behind as he was walking into a Brandon, Fla. Wal-Mart on Tuesday. Foster followed Daniels into the store after seeing him exiting his vehicle with a gun holstered under his shirt — which was perfectly legal for the 62-year-old Daniels to do since he holds a concealed weapon license. Nevertheless, Foster tackled Daniels from behind as he entered the store, and put him in a chokehold before taking him to the ground. Witnesses said that Foster yelled out that Daniels had a gun. They also said that Daniels yelled out that he had a license for it. Foster called 911 only after he tackled accosted Daniels. He was arrested and charged with battery.

Approximately half of Americans set goals for themselves at the beginning of each year. Sarah Priestley and Vincent Shen (TMFSarahp) Jan 12, 2017 at 12:20PM It is 2017 Resolutions week on Industry Focus, and in this episode, the consumer and retail team share their own goals for the new year. Hear about budgeting and decluttering from Motley Fool analysts Vincent Shen and Sarah Priestley, before they move on to discuss some surprising numbers behind resolutions in this country and the often challenging road to success, A full transcript follows the video. This episode was recorded on Jan. 10, 2017. Vincent Shen: Welcome to Industry Focus, the podcast that dives into a different sector of the stock market every day. I'm your host, Vincent Shen, and it is Tuesday, January 10th. If you've been following along with Industry Focus the past week or so, you probably heard Gaby's wonderful episode yesterday, you'll know that we're in the middle of a theme week. This time, we can kick off 2017 properly. We're talking about our resolutions for the year, the whole cast is. Joining me today in studio is fellow Motley Fool analyst, Sarah Priestley. How are you, Sarah?  Sarah Priestley: I'm good, thank you very much for having me. Shen: Are you ready to riff on resolutions for this year? Disappointments, really? Priestley: Yeah, disappointments, (laughs) mostly disappointments. Shen: A few things -- is this your first podcast experience for the year? Priestley: It is. Yes. Shen: Score one for me. And, before we get into what our new resolutions are for 2017, I think it's only fair if we revisit our goals from 2016, and do a quick audit to see how well we fared, just to clear the air with our listeners. Mine are permanently recorded in the annals of Foolish history with the article we wrote when, I think it was Sean and I, we talked about it last year around this time. You had not joined The Motley Fool yet, so what were your 2016 resolutions and how did you do? Priestley: In 2015, I moved from the U.K. to here and I got married. So, 2015 was a bit of a mess. Shen: Sure, fair enough. Priestley: 2016, I resolved to declutter and organize my life. Our apartment is not huge, and when you bring together two people's amount of things, it creates a lot of stuff. The result of that was that I got a storage unit. The problem is, now, my apartment is really decluttered, but the storage unit, you open the door and you can't get in there. So, that will also be added to one of my resolutions for this year -- declutter the storage unit. Shen: OK. When you came to the U.S. from the U.K., are you the kind of person who, when you pack, you bring the kitchen sink? Or were you more organized and minimalist in your approach? Priestley: No, I did throw away a lot of stuff, because I do have hoarder tendencies. But, I brought everything. I was actually talking to somebody before doing this podcast, I'm a bad packer with everything. We went to a wedding just before Christmas, and I took a carry on case, but it was so heavy that I couldn't pick it up, and my husband had to carry it. So, you can see, I do have multiple issues. Shen: (laughs) OK. So, let's get into our new goals for 2017. What do you have in mind? You mentioned getting the storage unit cleaned up, but what about more finance, investing, or Foolishly related, what do you have envisioned for the year? Priestley: For me, it's definitely budgeting. I think that's an area where, as a household, we can probably be better. We're not bad. We don't spend more than we make, which is the principle of budgeting. We contribute to our 401(k)s, we have a retirement savings plan, all those kinds of things. But I do think -- and I think this is something that a lot of people can learn from -- when you have a degree of disposable income, without too much planning, things slip by the wayside. Shen: Oh, absolutely. Priestley: And it snowballs. I noticed, for ours, eating out and the treats, the occasional coffee, the occasional trip to the mall or the movies, they add up, the accumulate. For me, I really want to get a handle on what I'm spending my money on and where we can improve. And hopefully, by making incremental improvements, then we can generate a lot more savings. Shen: Sure. I'm curious if there's anything in particular that inspired you to want to tackle this issue. Was it something you noticed, like, "Wow, I had eight Starbucks coffees this week?"  Priestley: That would not be unusual. (laughs) Actually, it was Maurie Backman, a Fool contributor wrote an article called something like You Can Have Your Latte and Retire Comfortably or something. She was basically talking about how saving on, just like you just said, your daily coffee, won't help you if you're spending $500 too much on your rent. Shen: Yes, absolutely. Priestley: Which is 100% true. And we went through our finances, and honestly I don't think that's an issue for us. I mean, D.C. metro rent is expensive, but you have to compare it to what everybody else is paying. I think we're paying a decent amount. So, we went through our big expenses. Then you get to all of the other stuff. Shen: Yeah, you whittle down everything else. Priestley: Exactly. So, for me and my husband, where our problem area is is eating out and all those fun things that add up. Shen: So, let's say you're approaching the summer or the fall, getting through 2017, is there anything you have in terms of hard metrics or numbers that you'll be using to gauge or benchmark your success? Priestley: Yeah, absolutely. I have until the end of this month, this is my tracking period. I'm using an Intuit app called Mint. You link it to your bank. It solves a big problem for me, because previously, I'd tried to track spending using my beloved Excel spreadsheets, and you end up with all these sub-charts and extra pages, sub-categories of clothing, gifts, all that stupid stuff. What this does is, the app links up to your bank account, and it breaks down your spending for you, so you can really see, easily -- it's an incredibly user-friendly interface -- what you're spending your money on. Shen: Mint has been around for quite some time now. I remember hearing about it when I was still back in school. For anybody who's not aware, I have not had experience with it, but I've heard a lot of good testimonials from people, they generally say it eases that process, instead of checking your statement, tracking it down yourself in a spreadsheet or by hand, whatever you use, you give it access to the account information and it pools all that together. And it gives you, from what I remember and checking out the site, it has a lot of great visuals, charts, things that help you track this along the way, right? Priestley: Absolutely. And there's a lot of those out there, this isn't the only app available. But I like it because, as I said, I think it breaks it down really well, it's very easy to use. You can set a budget in there, and it gives you a monthly tracker of how close you are to your budget, which I think is excellent. Then, the other thing I think is great is that they obviously have access to a huge amount of people's financial information. From that, they have a lot of learnings, so they send you tips on, "This credit card may be better for you and your spending," things like that. Some people may not like that. I personally appreciate it. Even if you don't use it, it's good insight. For me, it's exactly as you commented, it's really reducing friction between creating a budget, monitoring that, do you do it monthly, that's a huge amount of information to go through. That's what we were doing. I was downloading our financial statement, putting it into an Excel spreadsheet, going through. It's a very time-consuming exercise. And for some people, that's a very stressful exercise, too. So, for me, this really helps to make that process so much easier. I joke with people about the fact that I'm always on my phone looking at social media or news anyway. This is just another app on my phone that I can look at. Shen: Sure. I will say, being someone that used to track it manually on a weekly or bi-weekly basis, if you miss one or two of those sessions, whatever time period you do, it becomes very daunting. If you were to miss a month, and you suddenly have two months to go back on, you can lose momentum very quickly that way. Last question: How much is your husband involved in this process? And does he share your view of this resolution, or does he have some of his own things to work on? Priestley: He definitely shares in the view that we need to budget. January is our testing month. We've both committed to each other that we're not going to spend $X on eating out. I bring my lunch to work but he doesn't, and I think his lunch budget was something ridiculous like $5 a day, so I'm interested in seeing if he can stick to it. Shen: That's tough, especially if you're eating out. Priestley: Absolutely. But yes, we're both in line with it. I know, after reading your article on your resolutions, that's an important thing, to make sure you're both aligned. Shen: Yeah. For myself for 2017, I think our resolutions are actually very similar. It comes down to focus, and where we're focusing our efforts. You mentioned decluttering. That's pretty much exactly how I would describe mine. I'm going to be trying to, at least for the first stage, clean the house. I've been describing to people decluttering my life, essentially. There's some different parts to that. I've moved around a lot in the last 10 years. When I actually thought about this, I realize I moved around almost once per year. I think, for some people, that's a really easy way for them to get rid of a lot of junk or stuff that they have around, because when you're packing up, it's easy to say, "I really don't need this anymore." I maybe was not quite so good about doing that. I may have organized a little bit better and called that an improvement, but in the end, I have a habit of saving receipts, packaging, tags for returns and warranty reasons. And the thing is, when it comes down to it, I don't end up using even 1% of what I save. It makes no sense at all, my wife complains about it quite often. I have gotten better about it, but I think one person who really inspired me to pursue this resolution was actually my brother. He has what I describe as a minimalist approach to things, especially with his wardrobe. We're about the same height and build, and a lot of times I'll say, "Hey, I have some clothes, are you interested? Otherwise I'm going to donate it," and every single time, he'll look at it and really think about, is this something I'm going to take? He doesn't just take it because it's there. He has a set number of clothing items that he can combine in different variations to build different outfits, but it's as small as it can be. I'm pretty sure he could pack his entire wardrobe into one OK-sized suitcase, which blows me away.  So, I started to pack up a lot of things that are going to either the trash, donation bin, or putting them for sale. The donation bin, obviously, I would like to be as sustainable as possible, let this stuff keep getting used. There's some tax benefits to it, too. You don't even really get into much paperwork or filing needs unless it's more than $500. But on the selling side, I was really surprised because I was letting some things sit around like an old bike, outdoor gear I had, some photography equipment. And when I tallied it all up, it was actually way more than I was expecting. The best part is, between things like Facebook, Craigslist, eBay, you basically have it, as a seller, easier than ever to match the supply and demand for this stuff. I have and old daypack. It's in very good condition. I may have gotten $20 to $30 for it at a garage sale if I'd had it out, but going online, you can put it in front of millions of people in these various marketplaces, and I'll probably get at least two or three times that. So, little things like that add up. I plan on putting a lot of that toward savings and longer-term goals. That is the first phase for me for 2017. I'm trying to approach this on a quarterly basis so I can keep myself accountable, and also realistically gauge my progress.  I think the problem I had last year in terms of 2016 resolutions, the big thing was getting married and staying on our budget, which we very happily did, but at the same time, that took up so much of our energy and time during the planning process. You were a very sympathetic ear last year for me when I was talking about this stuff. My partner and I kind of gave up on some of the other resolutions we had in terms of investing together, and me educating her more about stocks, investing, and what's out there. Taking this more phased approach is important for us to hold each other accountable, and also approach things a little bit more independently we're not tied to each other, so it's easier to plan around some of the complexities with our schedules and things like that. Wrapping things up, we got through some of our personal experience from last year, what we are looking forward to this year. I also thought it would be interesting to talk broadly for Americans about how they approach resolutions, and how successful, in general, they tend to be, what they tend to focus on. The numbers I have here from this survey says "Top 10 New Year's resolutions for 2017." The biggest category, about one in five people, is lose weight and healthier eating. Then, there's a second related category, which is work out more often, which is #7 at 5%. So, about one in four people are focused on health and wellness. No. 2 is very broad life self-improvements. Maybe that's where we would be categorized with ours. No. 3, better financial decisions, again somewhere where we fall. But, the health and wellness is obviously a very popular one. Not to discourage people who have resolutions, but to look at what some of the results look like -- percentage of Americans who usually make New Year's resolutions, only 40%. I was surprised. I thought that was something that most people did. But the survey says 40%. Then, the percentage of people who do it on occasion is about 17%. And the rest, who never do it, like our man behind the glass, Austin, not interested at all when we asked him before the show, he's part of the 42% or so from the survey that never makes any resolutions. The thing that really makes this process seem more daunting is that the percentage of people who felt they were successful in achieving their resolution was only 9.2%. So, that can be rough. But the percentage who have infrequent success, about 50%. The percentage who never succeed, and fail every year, 42%. But, I think some of the things we talked about, in terms of holding yourself accountable, having a system in place, using resources, whether it's an app or something else can definitely help with that.  You shared some really interesting information with me earlier, especially on the health and wellness front. I think both of us are pursuing that on the side, not as Fool-related, but we want to be healthier and work out more. What numbers did you pull about people and gym memberships in January? Priestley: It's such a cliché, but there are obviously millions of people who resolve to get to fit and lose weight, and I'm one of them. I found that 12% of gym members join in January, and what's more depressing from that is that 80% of people who join a gym quit within five months. Honestly, if you're a regular gym attender, you've already beat 80% of people who are joining in January. I think the takeaway from this is, you should really think about starting a gym membership before you do it. That's the position I'm in now. I'm trying a few classes, I'm trying to work out by myself and see if that will help me avoid falling into this trap. Shen: That is not surprising, that 12%. The way it should break out on a monthly basis, if every month were equal, it's like 8%. So, the 12% in January, I can't say I'm surprised. In terms of how your success goes, you mentioned that most people quit within five months, that survey had an interesting question with the length of your resolution -- how many people are able to maintain them throughout time. About three out of four people can maintain them through the first week. (laughs) About 60% of people manage to maintain them past the first month. But the good news is, that first month gauge is actually pretty solid. The drop off from one month at 60% to past six months, it drops off after six months to about 45%. So if you can make it past that first month, you are in great shape at potentially keeping this up. I do think that regarding the five-month gym membership thing, the people who can't make it, they might make it the first couple weeks, then stop, and after months of donating to the local gym, they realize that there might be better uses. Is there anything else that you'd like to share, Sarah, in terms of your approach, or any other lessons that you've learned in prior years with resolutions, before we wrap up here? Priestley: There was actually one sentence in your article that I thought was really insightful and good for people to learn. "Ultimately, when you have just months to coordinate your wedding and a few decades to worry about retirement, the near-term commitment takes priority." And, obviously, in your case, it was the wedding. But for everybody, we always have a near-term commitment that's coming up. For me, often, it's visiting family, going back home, which breaks up my year quite a lot, and often interrupts my best efforts with both financial planning and fitness goals. So, I think that everybody needs to keep this in mind. We really need to plan for both the near-term commitments and the long-term. Shen: Yeah. You brought up something for my article and I wanted to do the same thing from yours. I really like the way that you described prioritizing properly and staying busy. I think for me as well, during 2016, I was able to say, "Hey, I'm still needing meeting my goals," because I was busying myself with wedding planning stuff or something along those lines. But it really wasn't a very substantive step toward my actual end goal. For this year, I want to be a lot better in this decluttering my life process to make sure that whatever I'm doing is not just me filling my time trying to make me feel better about it, saying, "Oh, I spent a little bit of time on resolutions," but actually something substantive enough that's pushing me to progress forward. So, that was something that I'm probably guilty of quite often, so it really hit a nerve, when I read your article. Thanks a lot for joining the show. I hope Fools aren't too discouraged. I think 2017 is looking to be a good year for a lot of us, and despite what some of the stats might say it's up to you. Keep it up, hold yourself accountable.

Bryton Mellot, 22, was arrested on the 4th of July last year on flag burning charges after posting images of his act and a long rant on his Facebook page. Threats of violence against Mellot quickly appeared under his post, which also noted his place of employment. Bryton Mellot said he planned out his flag burning free speech protest carefully. He also maintains the Illinois flag desecration law banning him from lighting the American Flag on fire is unconstitutional. Here’s an excerpt from Mellot’s flag burning Facebook post: “I am not proud to be an American. In this moment, being proud of my country is to ignore the atrocities committed against people of color, people living in poverty, people who identify as women, and against my own queer community on a daily basis.” Police in Urbana, a Chicago suburb, arrested Mellot while he was working at Walmart at least, in part, for his own protection, they maintain. Law enforcement officers were concerned about the threats of violence which had been levied on social media being carried out, and Bryton Mellot or Walmart shoppers and employees getting hurt, Fox News notes. @Walmart if you love your country and troops fire him ASAP!! #brytonmellot pic.twitter.com/xl8uHhAPK0 — mrclutch212 (@gritzangravy212) July 4, 2016 “Open dissent is the highest form of American patriotism,” Bryton Mellot said in a prepared statement after filing the lawsuit. “And it was a frightening display of irony that on the Fourth of July, I should be taken from my workplace to sit in a county jail for exercising this liberty.” Hundreds of negative comments were posted to Mellot’s Facebook page after he shared the photos of him lighting the flag on fire. After Urbana police officers arrested the Chicago area man, he was detained for several hours and ultimately released without being charged with flag burning or any other crime, the News-Gazette reports. “I would like to one day feel a sense of pride toward my nationality again. But too little progress has been made. Too many people still suffer at the hands of politicians influenced by special interests,” Mellot also posted to Facebook, according to BizPacReview. “I do not have pride in my country. I am overwhelmingly ashamed, and I will demonstrate my feelings accordingly. #ArrestMe.” Champaign County State’s Attorney Julia Rietz told the press laws dealing with flag burning and constitutional rights are “extremely complex.” Rietz also states the Urbana Police Department recognizes the Bryton Mellot flag burning incident is a case where free speech rights might have “been in conflict” with the safety of innocent bystanders. “In this circumstance, our officers acted in good faith and in reliance on a state law that was passed by our legislature in an attempt to do just that. We respect the analysis of the State’s Attorney’s Office and their determination not to proceed with the prosecution in this matter,” the Champaign County State’s Attorney continued. The Bryont Mellot flag burning lawsuit names multiple Urbana police officers. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Illinois is representing Mellot in the lawsuit, which was filed on Wednesday. “It’s very clear that this law is unconstitutional and we want to make sure that in the future, Illinois law enforcement officers know that they cannot arrest people under this statute,” ACLU attorney Rebecca Glenberg said. #FreedomOfSpeech #BrytonMellot pic.twitter.com/nmg8aNzYYJ — Juxhin Çela???????? (@JuxhinCelaEU) July 6, 2016 The United States Supreme Court struck down flag burning laws in some states in separate rulings in both 1989 and 1990. The court ruled flag desecration is a constitutionally protected form of free speech as guaranteed by the First Amendment. Arrest for desecration of the flag is rare. The Supreme Court ruling struck down a flag burning law in Wisconsin in the 1990s. A Missouri flag desecration law was ultimately repealed after an extensive court battle and will no longer be effective after the end of this month. Despite the United States Supreme Court ruling, approximately 40 states still have flag burning laws on the books.

Ruben SantiagoSpringfield Police photo  "Ironic, I know, "said Springfield police spokesman Sgt. John Delaney. Ruben Santiago of Fort Pleasant St. was arrested just before noon and charged with larceny of more than $250. Delaney said Detective Gifford Jenkins was in the Walmart at 1105 Boston Road on an unrelated matter when store security approached to say they had spotted someone shoplifting. They showed him security footage of a man trying to steal a Night Owl Video Home Security DVR / Camera System. Gifford watched Santiago leave through a fire exit, and radioed his description to another detective in the area, Eric Ganley, who began to follow him. Santiago apparently realized he was being followed and started to run through yards in the area of Contessa Street and Grayson Drive, Delaney said. Police K-9 team of office George Flanagan and his dog Riko were called into track him. Santiago was quickly found him in a back yard and recovered the surveillance system. Santiago is scheduled to be arraigned Thursday in Springfield District Court.

(Gavin McIntyre | The Bay City Times) (Gavin McIntyre) Print Email Cole Waterman | cwaterma@mlive.com By Cole Waterman | cwaterma@mlive.com The Bay City Times Follow on Twitter on January 12, 2017 at 9:15 AM, updated January 13, 2017 at 12:48 PM comments Andrew R. Abellard's LinkedIn profile photo  BAY CITY, MI -- A dreary gray sky hung over Bay City in the waning December days. Howling winds whipped through the streets, stinging one's skin and adding to the already bitter cold. As the white snow increasingly turned to slush, a monochromatic palette pervaded. In short, it was a fairly typical scene for the season. As many in the city shopped for presents, strung decorative lights, and planned on spending time with loved ones, Andrew R. Abellard made his home in a disused semi-trailer. On one of the year's last days, likely the same day children tore through wrapping paper in the warm houses surrounding him, Abellard prepared for sleep on the trailer's rotting wood floor. It was about 34 degrees outside, cold enough to see your breath, and the 30-year-old man was wearing layers -- a stocking hat, gray sweatpants and a matching sweatshirt. A frigid Michigan winter was a far cry from the environs of Abellard's Haitian homeland, where the average temperature in December ranges from 70 to 80 degrees. On Christmas, the temperature for the Caribbean nation's capital of Port-au-Prince was 82 degrees. About 15 feet from the trailer's doors, Abellard slid his meager frame inside a red sleeping bag. He lay with his head to the west and feet to the east. Around him he'd scattered personal items -- a backpack containing clothes, religious books, a notebook computer, and a cellphone, a Walmart bag holding a toothbrush, toothpaste, and a wristwatch, a pair of shoes and a pair of flip-flops, a suitcase, and small glass jars containing crystals. With his frail left hand, he grasped a 7-Eleven Big Gulp cup with a small amount of liquid inside it. He rolled onto his right side and curled up. And then, he slipped away. Abellard, a man who professed to hear the voice of God, died of hypothermia, likely on Christmas Day. A grim discovery Just past noon on Tuesday, Jan 3, a police officer responded to 308 State St. on Bay City's West Side after Bay County Central Dispatch received a call of some men having found a dead body. Several semi-trailers were parked on the property and the callers directed the officer to one parked east to west. The officer entered the trailer and saw an obviously deceased person inside. Paramedics arrived and officially declared the subject dead. According to police records obtained by The Bay City Times/MLive through a Freedom of Information Act request, three men had discovered the body, one of which had arrived there to potentially buy the trailer. On opening the back of the trailer to ensure its roof wasn't leaky, they saw a man lying in a sleeping bag, his mouth open. On realizing the man was deceased, the men called 911. 'Transient' man died of hypothermia in back of semi-trailer, police say The trailer had not been moved for about one year, witnesses told police. The trailer's owner arrived on scene shortly thereafter and told police that as far as he knew, the trailer hadn't been opened since June. More police responded to the scene. Inside the dead man's backpack, they found a wallet containing a Michigan driver's license, a Social Security card, and an immigration card showing he hailed from Haiti, according to police records. All three cards identified the deceased as Andrew Robert Abellard. Police wrote in their reports that there was no sign of a struggle. They described Abellard's body as "quite emaciated." Though he stood 5 feet 6 inches tall, he weighed 75 pounds. His normal weight should have been between 118 and 154 pounds, according to medical experts. Abellard had an Etsy account that said he moved from Haiti to Florida around 2002. He began painting 10 years later, the activity quickly becoming his "favorite hobby." His LinkedIn profile states he earned an associate degree in graphic design. Investigators contacted Abellard's 28-year-old wife, Kayla J. Abellard, with whom he had two children. She gave an account of her husband's bizarre behavior the last year of his life. The couple was living in Florida in January when Abellard began drinking salt water. Andrew R. Abellard's Facebook profile photo  "He told me that God was making him do it," she told police, according to their reports. "Andrew then wanted me to drink salt water. I refused to drink it. He told me that we did not have the same views and that he no longer wanted to be in a relationship with me." That same month, Kayla Abellard moved to Michigan. In April, her husband joined her and they resided in a Hampton Township apartment. But his peculiar behavior continued. "In May, Andrew began eating only flour tortillas," she told police. "He told me that God was telling him that was the only thing he should eat. He... became very thin. He looked sickly due to his low weight." Abellard left his family in May. His wife was thereafter unable to contact him via telephone or email, she said. She last saw him in August, walking out of the Bangor Township Walmart. "I questioned him why he would just leave his children like that," she told police. "He told me we had different views on life. He looked skinny at that time." The Times was unable to contact Kayla Abellard or Andrew Abellard's family in Haiti for comment. Death by hypothermia Forensic pathologist Dr. Kanu Virani conducted an autopsy on Abellard's remains on Jan. 4. He concluded Abellard died from "accidental hypothermia" about Dec. 25, an ignominious end for a man who left the Americas' poorest nation for its most affluent. Hypothermia is a condition when a person's body loses heat faster than it can produce it, resulting in a dangerously low body temperature. While a normal human body temperature is around 98.6 degrees, hypothermia sets in once it drops below 95 degrees. Exacerbating hypothermia in cold temperatures are factors like poor food intake, improper clothing and equipment, wetness, fatigue and exhaustion, dehydration, alcohol intake, and being unaware that one is suffering from the condition, according to a Princeton University report.  At 90 degrees, the body tries moving into a hibernation status, shutting down peripheral blood flow and reducing the breathing and heart rates. Four degrees colder, the body is in a "metabolic icebox" state, with the suffered looking dead while still being alive. Prior to death, the person's breathing becomes erratic and shallow. Cardiac arrhythmias develop and, eventually, the heart stops.  Good Samaritan Rescue Mission, 713 Ninth St.Tyler Sutherland | MLive.com  Homelessness and mental illness For his last few months, it appears Abellard was homeless. There's no record of him having stayed at the Good Samaritan Rescue Mission at 713 Ninth St. in Bay City. He was never booked in the Bay County Jail, either. His wife's statement to police that he repeatedly talked about receiving instructions from God indicates he was likely suffering from auditory hallucinations. Hearing voices is the most common hallucination experienced by people suffering from a psychosis such as schizophrenia, according to medical experts. Those afflicted with temporal lobe epilepsy have also been known to experience such hallucinations, particularly with a religious bent, according to a 2013 article by researchers at the University of Wollongong in Australia. "This may include hearing a voice telling the individual to kneel and worship God, hearing hallucinations of God's voice, hearing the repetition of a religious expression, or the (hallucination) may be regarded as a prophecy or deeper message being conveyed to the individual." Travis Pashak  Travis Pashak, assistant professor of psychology at Saginaw Valley State University, said that, broadly speaking, there is a strong link between homelessness and mental health disorders. "A few of the main pathways to homelessness include psychoses such as schizophrenia, drug addiction problems, and sometimes things like PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder). It sounds like (Abellard) was having delusions, which may imply more severe problems." Pashak said that prior to the 1950s, the country "had a pretty nice support system in place for when folks had more severe breakdowns." A process of deinstitutionalization then began. Pashak described the process as a political movement to put less funding in long-term chronic healthcare, the logic being that those benefiting from it were becoming too dependent on it and they needed to be reintegrated into society. "Looking back now, we kind of see that's a flawed logic," he said. "The number of beds (in mental health facilities) over the 40 years between '50 and '90 dropped significantly. Initially it was thought to be a success, then it was noticed there were more and more homeless folks." What resulted was a revolving door effect, wherein homeless individuals would spend time on the streets, check into an emergency room, get shelter for a few days, then be discharged and back on the streets with medical professionals being unable to refer them elsewhere, Pashak said. While resources are prevalent for those on the polar ends of mental disorders -- for example, those who are largely functional and see a therapist once or week and those who suffer from extreme, debilitating illnesses -- those in the middle who may largely maintain a degree of normality then suffer a breakdown often fall through the cracks, Pashak said. "In my opinion, that's one of our big deficiencies in the enterprise of mental health," he said. Executive Director Dan Streeter walks through the section of the mission that could be renovated Wednesday, July 30, 2015 at Good Samaritan Rescue Mission, 713 9th St. in Bay City.Yfat Yossifor | MLive.comm  Dan Streeter, the chief executive officer for the Good Samaritan Rescue Mission at 713 Ninth St. in Bay City, and the City Rescue Mission in Saginaw, said the agency has seen increasing rates of homeless suffering from some degree of mental disorder. "We've seen over the last several years a large increase in the number of those dealing with homelessness experiencing difficulties with mental illness," Streeter said. About 30 percent of shelter residents on any given night suffer from some sort of mental illness, he estimated. That figure is consistent with national trends. According to a September 2016 report from the Arlington, Virginia-based Treatment Advocacy Center, an estimated one-third of the country's total homeless population is composed of people suffering from untreated serious mental illnesses. Such a high rate is a reason for the local shelter having a strong partnership with local mental health authorities, Streeter said. "When we identify there is a mental health issue, we'll be contacting and coordinating with mental health professionals for their care," he said. Getting help for an adult afflicted with a mental disorder is a challenging endeavor, however. Unless the person is willing to check him or herself in for treatment -- or displays intense destructive or violent tendencies -- there's not much others can do. Streeter said if they see behavior by a person that shows risk to themselves or others, they can try and work with the legal system to get the person committed to care, but those are "very extreme situations." "Until someone gets to that point, if they don't want care, our hands are kind of tied," he said. The Bay City shelter can house up to 110 residents and averaged 70 per night in 2016, Streeter said. While homelessness is a year-round problem, single men tend to check in to the shelter more often in the winter months. Residency for women and children tends to increase in August, Streeter said. No matter people's backgrounds or current predicaments, the shelter is always open to them, Streeter said. "It's open no matter what the situation is," he said. "They can come in out of the elements and we'll provide them a safe shelter. We're going to try to be that safety net for people in what we believe is one of the most difficult times of their lives. "For some experiencing homelessness," Streeter soberly added, "it is a life or death situation."

(Joe Burbank/Orlando Sentinel via AP) ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — Law enforcement officers made good on promises to go after people they think aided a fugitive in the weeks before he became the focus of a manhunt in the fatal shooting of an Orlando police sergeant, arresting three people they say helped him after the killing of his pregnant ex-girlfriend. Markeith Loyd's niece, Lakensha Smith-Loyd, was arrested on an accessory charge Wednesday. Later the same day, authorities arrested an ex-girlfriend of Loyd's: Jameis Slaughter, who also faces a charge of accessory, according to online jail records. And a day earlier, Zarghee Mayan, the fugitive's supervisor at a fried chicken restaurant, was arrested on the same charge. A manhunt for Loyd after Monday's fatal shooting of Master Sgt. Debra Clayton entered its fourth day Thursday as authorities promised to reward anyone who turns him in and punish anyone who helps him hide. More than 500 tips have come in from the public, which authorities believe may be particularly important, because others may be helping him hide. Orlando Police Chief John Mina had warned earlier this week that anyone helping Loyd "will be put behind bars and brought to justice as well." Mayan's arrest affidavit said Smith-Loyd collected money from him to give to her uncle in the days after the slaying of his ex-girlfriend in mid-December. Smith-Loyd's affidavit says she contacted deputies after the ex-girlfriend's death and promised to help them find her uncle if they first told her whether a firearm had been recovered from the scene of the slaying. Then she stopped cooperating even as she contacted others on her uncle's behalf, the affidavit said. Slaughter is accused of collecting money for Loyd. Mayan is accused of supplying restaurant food to his former co-worker, driving him around and offering him money, despite knowing that he was wanted, the affidavit said. Mayan told authorities his most recent encounter with Loyd was last Saturday, two days before Clayton was fatally shot in a Wal-Mart parking lot. Mayan said he noticed that Loyd was armed and wearing body armor when they embraced, according to his arrest affidavit. During another encounter, right after Loyd's ex-girlfriend was killed in mid-December, Mayan said Loyd came into the restaurant with a gun, pointed it at Mayan and said, "'Drive me or I will kill you. I just did something real bad,'" the affidavit said. Mayan said he drove Loyd to several locations, including the home of Loyd's estranged wife, where Loyd told him to knock on the door. Mayan said he only walked to the door without knocking because he was afraid Lloyd would shoot her, according to the affidavit, which noted that Mayan told conflicting stories about his encounters with Loyd. After Clayton was shot, many of her colleagues immediately joined the pursuit; among them was a sheriff's Deputy First Class Norman Lewis, who died when he was thrown from his motorcycle in an accident. Funerals were planned for Lewis for Friday and Clayton for Saturday.

The arrests stem from the investigation into the shooting death of Sade Dixon, Markeith Loyd's pregnant girlfriend, in December. Authorities said the suspects aided Loyd's attempts to avoid apprehension after that killing. Loyd also is suspected of killing Master Sgt. Debra Clayton on Monday when she tried to approach him at an Orlando-area Walmart. One of the people arrested Wednesday was Lakensha Smith Loyd, one of Loyd's nieces. Orange County deputies said in an arrest affidavit that she was contacting people on behalf of her uncle after Dixon was killed and indicated she was in contact with him after the shooting. They also believe she went to a restaurant where her uncle worked to pick up $200 as he tried to avoid arrest for Dixon's killing. It is unclear whether Smith Loyd has a lawyer. She could be charged with being an accessory after the fact, a felony. Also arrested Tuesday was Zarghee Mayan, who deputies said never contacted authorities after he met Markeith Loyd, who told him he had killed Dixon. Mayan appeared before a judge for a bond hearing Wednesday but was denied bail. He will be charged with being an accessory after the fact. CNN reached out to the public defender's office for comment but Melissa Vickers, the chief assistant public defender, said they do not discuss cases with the media. The third person arrested, Jameis Slaughter, is also accused of being an accessory after the fact. Authorities said she also collected money to give to Loyd, her former boyfriend, and lied to cops about her communication with the suspect. Slaughter said Loyd told her cops would have to kill him because he wasn't going back to prison, according to an affidavit from the Orange County Sheriff's Office. Authorities said the car of Jamesia Slaughter, Jameis's twin sister, was seen being driven around the Walmart 90 minutes after Clayton was killed. Jameis Slaughter is also charged with giving a false name to police when she was detained Wednesday after identifying herself initially as her twin. Clayton and other officer killed On Monday morning, Clayton received word that Loyd was near a Walmart and tried to confront him. "As soon as she said, 'Stop,' he basically opened fire on her," Orlando police Chief John Mina said. At a news conference Thursday, Mina said Loyd continued to shoot Clayton even after she was down. Mina added that Clayton apparently shot Loyd in the chest, but the bullet was stopped by a bulletproof vest. Later Loyd discarded his pants and his shirt, Mina said. The manhunt for Loyd led to several injuries and the death of Orange County Sheriff's Deputy 1st Class Norman Lewis, who died in a motorcycle crash while searching for him on the day of Clayton's death. Authorities have increased the reward for information leading to Loyd's arrest to $100,000. The pursuit After the shooting of Clayton, Loyd fled in a car and fired shots at another officer, police said. That officer was not seriously injured. The suspect then abandoned the first vehicle and carjacked another one. He ditched that second vehicle shortly afterward and ran into an apartment complex, Mina said. It is unclear where he is now. But a "be on the lookout" alert has been sent nationwide, which is standard procedure with Florida murder suspects, police spokeswoman Michelle Guido said. Mina said Loyd would be charged with first-degree murder of a law enforcement officer and attempted murder of the officer at whom he fired. The Orlando Police Department has received more than 800 tips about the case, officials said Thursday. Police have searched more than 100 locations, Mina added. Copyright 2017 by CNN NewSource.

Stock Popped Today The human capital management specialist jumped after securing its biggest-ever deal. Steve Symington (TMFSymington) Jan 11, 2017 at 9:21PM IMAGE SOURCE: Workday Inc. What happened Shares of Workday Inc. (NYSE:WDAY) climbed 9.9% on Wednesday, after the company announced that Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) has purchased a subscription to its Workday Human Capital Management, Recruiting, Learning, and Planning applications. So what Workday also noted it isn't updating its latest financial guidance, which incidentally caused Workday stock to plunge last month as the company warned a few larger deals with multinational customers had been delayed. More specifically, Workday told investors to expect fiscal fourth quarter to be in the range of $427 million to $430 million. That represented 32% to 33% year-over-year growth but fell below Wall Street's estimates at the time for fiscal Q4 revenue of $433.6 million. Now what Nonetheless, while Workday typically uses its quarterly conference calls to fill investors in on its latest customer additions, it's telling that this single deal merited its own SEC filing and caused today's big pop. With more than 2 million employees globally, Wal-Mart is easily Workday's biggest customer yet, and adds to the already enviable list of hundreds of industry leaders that trust its enterprise cloud solutions, ranging from Netflix to Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, TripAdvisor, Panera Bread, Chiquita, and Zillow Group, to name only a few. Assuming Workday can sustain the impressive 97% customer satisfaction rating it achieved last year, I suspect Workday investors who opt to hold the stock from here will be more than pleased as its growth story continues to play out.

Steve Symington has no position in any stocks mentioned.

How to buy snow chains Print Email Rob Davis | The Oregonian/OregonLive By Rob Davis | The Oregonian/OregonLive The Oregonian Email the author | Follow on Twitter on January 11, 2017 at 6:05 PM, updated January 11, 2017 at 7:09 PM comments The temporary requirement for vehicles to be equipped with snow chains in Portland Wednesday sent retailers scrambling to keep up. Most stores in the region are sold out. But we found a few still have chains in stock. One key recommendation: Call first. Availability often depends on your tire size. Did we miss a store with chains? Let us know in the comments below. Walmart Tire chains are sold out at several stores around the metro area, said Leslee Wright, a Walmart spokeswoman. "Inventory is really low," she said. There are some stores that have chains in stock, Wright said, but she encouraged people looking for chains to call ahead. Employees are working to expedite new shipments, she said. Fred Meyer Location: 7404 N. Interstate, Portland. Hours: 7 a.m. to 11 p.m. Selection: The store has a few styles of chains left, mostly for larger tires, according to an employee. --- Location: 3030 N.E. Weidler St., Portland Hours: 7 a.m. to 11 p.m. Selection: The store has about a dozen sets of cable chains in stock, including styles for smaller cars and trucks and SUVs. "We are almost wiped out," an employee said. --- Sold out: Hawthorne, Gateway, SE 82nd, SE 147th & SE Division, Gresham (except for one pair for a large truck), Raleigh Hills Doesn't carry them: Burlingame Les Schwab Most metro-area stores have adequate supplies of chains, but depending on the store location, some sizes may be missing, according to the company. O'Reilly Auto Parts Location: 5155 N. Lombard St., Portland Hours: 7:30 a.m. to 9 p.m. Selection: An employee at the store said chains have been selling all day. The store only has a few odd sizes left for larger tires. --- Location: 30 S.E. Grand Ave., Portland. Hours: 7:30 p.m. to 8 p.m. Selection: Some chains are still in stock, mostly chain-link options and not cable or heavy-duty varieties, an employee said. For a smaller cars, chains range in price from about $40 to $100 at the store. For pickups and SUVs, prices range from $80 to $120, the employee said. --- Location: 555 N.E. 122nd Ave., Portland. Hours: 7:30 a.m. to 9 p.m. Selection: "We're running low right now," an employee said. In the past two days, the store has sold nearly all the chains it had in stock, he said. If weather allows, the store is expecting a fresh shipment tomorrow morning. Customers looking for chains could try calling the location after 9 a.m., the employee said. Advance Auto Parts Location: 727 S.E. 122nd Ave. Hours: 7 a.m. to midnight Selection: The store has 12 pallets of chains in stock. "Call us with a size and we can check availability," a manager said.

Source: Jac Bedrossian. FORREST COUNTY, MS (WDAM) - Mayor Johnny DuPree held a press conference about the homeless encampment clearing by Walmart on U.S. Hwy 49 in Hattiesburg Wednesday morning. He talked about his collaboration with the Mississippi United To End Homelessness organization and city homelessness coordinator, Kim Townsend on the project. Together, they were able to clear the wooded area and find housing for some of the homeless people living in the woods.  "It's a culture," DuPree said. "If you don't stop it where it is, you perpetuate it. It's not just adults, it's the children. The children grow up and it's all they know." DuPree also explained that because the wooded area was privately owned, it took several months to disband the camps.  While many in the community have applauded the move, some neighbors of the homeless community said it could not come soon enough. One resident who wanted to remain anonymous said that the camps have been going on for 10 years. In a Facebook message, he talked about the burden the camps brought on his community.  He said, "Protecting our property values is our upmost concern, and we are pleased with the efforts being done to make the area we pay to call home, just that." Out of the 16 people found at the camp site, eight have found housing and an additional four have signed initial paperwork to find housing. MUTEH offers medical, mental health and employment services in addition to helping the homeless find a permanent home.  The organization asks the Pine Belt to donate kitchen supplies. If you are interested in donating, call Amanda McDonald at 601-960-0557. Copyright WDAM 2017.

Terrell made her announcement public in a LinkedIn post Tuesday (Jan. 10). In that post Terrell said she will take the next step in her career after leading technology for Walmart for the past six years. She noted to her friends and colleagues that it’s been a “wild ride and there is no bigger game.” Terrell credited Wal-Mart for its mission focused culture that puts customers first and its scale that is second to none. “The learning for me has been exponential. I leave my work family and my Arkansas friends with great reluctance but also with great anticipation as I step boldly into a new frontier. … Walmart, you will always have my heart … but as of March my mind and energy will be otherwise engaged,” Terrell noted in the post. She ended the post in typical true Walmart fashion citing the Walmart Cheer and thanking the retailer for teaching her the customer is always first. Terrell did not say where she is going, only that is somewhere outside of Arkansas. Terrell joined Walmart in December 2010 and was promoted to chief information officer in February 2012. For the past six years she has had the responsibility for the largest segments of the global Walmart Technology portfolio including Information Systems Division (ISD), Global Back Office Solutions, and Data and Analytics overseeing more than 5,000 technologist around the world. Terrell is an engineer who spent 4 years at Baxter International before joining Wal-Mart. Prior to that she worked for DaimlerChrysler Group for six year rising to the rank of chief information officer. She graduating from Purdue University with an electrical engineering master’s degree in 1988. She has been a vocal voice for STEM education and the need for more mentoring of girls and women in this area as part of the Million Women Mentors program. Two years ago Terrell was the keynote speaker at the first Northwest Arkansas Technology Conference. From that podium Terrell said she was proud to be an engineer in a family of teachers, but her parents never really understood what her job is. She challenged universities in Arkansas to put more emphasis on computer science graduates as just 1 in 17 technologies in the country graduated with a degree in computer science. She said Northwest Arkansas has got to do a better job fostering STEM education and put as much emphasis on STEM as seen in the Walton College entrepreneurship and other business degree programs. “If we don’t, we will miss an opportunity,” she said in 2014. Terrell’s last day at Walmart will be Feb. 24 and CEO Doug McMillon noted in an internal memo to employees that new leadership in technology is expected to be announced soon. The retail giant has been undergoing several top management changes in its IT division and elsewhere. Rosalind Brewer is stepping down as CEO of Sam’s Club at the end of January and Chris Sultemeier is retiring at the same time as CEO of Walmart Logistics. Since the acquisition of Jet, the Walmart Global e-Commerce CEO Neil Ashe has departed and Marc Lore, CEO and co-founder of Jet has taken over Walmart.com operations in addition to running Jet.com. McMillon applauded Terrell for her service saying that her “character was clear – modernize our technology team and power our store and club businesses by enabling a seamless shopping experience at scale.” Some of the work overseen by Terrell includes: geofencing around stores, Walmart Pay and the technology behind self check-out. She also helped to manage the retailers online grocery pickup platform.

Bean Board Member and Co-Owner Linda Bean on the brand being boycotted after she contributed money to the Trump campaign. Linda Bean, granddaughter of L.L. Bean’s founder, on Friday said anti-Trump boycotts are part of a larger plan—to kill jobs. Continue Reading Below “It’s the bullies who want to go after, basically, our jobs,” she told the FOX Business Network’s Stuart Varney. “I believe it’s just a smokescreen because the effect of a boycott is to kill jobs – boycotts and bullies kill jobs.” Grabyourwallet.org recently called for a boycott of L.L. Bean (and 38 other stores including Walmart, Macy’s and Bloomingdales), because Bean contributed $60,000 to a political action committee supporting President-elect Donald Trump. The Federal Election Commission said the donation exceeded the PAC’s individual donor limit of $5,000. But Bean says the company shouldn’t take heat for her political affiliations. “It was not the company donation. It was my personal donation and the company itself stays politically neutral,” she said. She noted that L.L. Bean has a “no endorsing” candidate policy. The president elect thanked Linda for her support in a Tweet on Thursday. Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT Thank you to Linda Bean of L.L.Bean for your great support and courage.

How great it is to be free to vote for your own candidate and set the record straight.” More on this... Linda Bean Calls Boycott ‘Un-American,’ Trump Says Thank You in Tweet Bean also discussed what it’s like to be a conservative in the business world.  “You know there are not many people who are in the upper-echelons of business—private enterprise, who are Trump supporters,” said FBN’s Varney. “That is an elite group and the elites largely are for the left. Am I right there?” “Well it’s a strange paradox because look at what’s happened [with] the stock market,” she replied. “Those are the guys that are probably right there. Are they saying one thing and putting their money in another place?” “But you are an exception,” Varney responded. “Most people in the executive suite, I think, I’m told are for the left, not specifically [and] desperately for Donald Trump. You’re an exception to the rule.” “I’ve always been maybe a little bit of a rebel,” answered Bean.

How Trump Could Kill a Plan to Get You Overtime Pay - Eagle Pass Business Journal Home About News Sports Videos Photo Galleries EPBJ Awards Contact How Trump Could Kill a Plan to Get You Overtime Pay by Justin Elliott, ProPublica Donald Trump ran for president as the billionaire who would champion working people. As the president-elect put it in one of the major economic speeches of his campaign: “Too many of our leaders have forgotten that it’s their duty to protect the jobs, wages and well-being of American workers before any other consideration.” One of the first tests of Trump’s pledge to help workers will come in how his administration handles the complicated rules that govern who has the right to time-and-a-half overtime pay. Business groups and Republican state attorneys general sued to stop an Obama administration rule that would expand who gets overtime pay. A federal court temporarily blocked the rule in November. Now the Trump administration will decide whether to continue defending the rule in court. At stake is the possibility of overtime pay for about 4 million workers around the country. To get a sense of how big a deal that is: The still-sketchy deal to save factory jobs at a Carrier plant in Indiana — the subject of numerous Trump tweets and extensive media coverage — affected 1,000 or fewer workers. Here’s how overtime works now Most employees in the country have the legal right to time-and-a-half overtime pay if they work more than 40 hours in a week. But there’s a major exception to that: white-collar workers. So who qualifies as a white-collar worker? The government has a test for that. To be considered a white-collar worker who does not qualify for overtime pay: You have to be paid a salary and not by the hour. You have to make more than $455 per week — the equivalent of $23,660 per year. And you have to work in certain types of jobs, including executive, administrative or professional positions. That has nothing to do with your title, but rather is defined by the nature of your job. For example, executive employees have to, among other things, supervise other workers. Here are more details on how it all works. Labor advocates say some employers have been playing games with who is considered a white-collar worker. There have been a series of lawsuits and settlements outlining how, for example, the dollar store industry classifies employees as managers to avoid paying overtime. Some workers classified as managers spent much of their time doing the same manual labor as their subordinates. Halliburton in 2015 agreed to pay $18 million in back wages for overtime to about 1,000 employees who worked as pipe recovery specialists and drilling advisers, among other jobs. The company acknowledged it had improperly classified those workers as exempt from the overtime rules. Walmart paid a $4.8 million settlement in 2012 for not paying security guards and other employees overtime they were due. The Obama administration argues that the current overtime salary threshold, which was last raised in 2004 and has been eroded by inflation, is outdated. According to the Department of Labor, in 1975, 62 percent of full-time salaried workers were eligible for overtime based on their pay. That compares to just 7 percent today. The Obama rule would make another 4 million people eligible for overtime The most important change made by the Obama administration was raising the salary threshold below which you generally have the right to overtime pay, regardless of your job duties. The new level — which is currently on hold because of the pending lawsuit — is $913 per week, or $47,476 per year. That’s double the old standard of $23,660 per year. The Department of Labor has calculated that the new rule could benefit 4.2 million workers around the country. The affected workers would either start getting overtime for any time worked over 40 hours a week, or their salaries would have to be increased above the new threshold. Business groups opposing the rule, most prominently the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, argued that “the salary threshold is going to result in significant new labor costs and cause many disruptions in how work gets done” including by reducing “workplace flexibility, remote electronic access to work, and opportunities for career advancement.” Some employers, acting on the expectation that the rule would go into effect, have already raised salaries. The biggest name on the list is Walmart, which bumped starting pay for some managers from $45,000 to $48,500 in order to exempt them from overtime pay. Politico reported that other employers that had promised pay increases, including several universities, have now cancelled the raises in light of the uncertainty around whether the rule will actually go in effect. (Have you heard anything from your employer about overtime changes? Tell us about it.) Trump’s pick for labor secretary has attacked the idea of expanding overtime, and the president-elect himself seems skeptical When Trump was asked about the rule in August, he spoke of “a delay or a carve-out of sorts for our small business owners.” It’s not clear from his comments that Trump actually knew the details of the pending Obama changes. The Trump transition team didn’t response to a request for comment. The Department of Justice also declined to comment about what could happen in the lawsuit after Jan. 20. Andrew Puzder, Trump’s pick to be secretary of labor and the CEO of a fast-food company, has spoken out strongly against the overtime rule. In a 2014 Wall Street Journal op-ed, Puzder warned against “rewarding time spent rather than time well spent.” “What they lose in overtime pay they gain in the stature and sense of accomplishment that comes from being a salaried manager,” Puzder said of workers trying to climb the management ladder. The fate of the rule depends on how things play out in a lawsuit that will drag on past the inauguration In September, business groups including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce along with 21 states sued to block the new overtime rule. In late November, a federal judge in Texas temporarily blocked the rule from going into effect, which was supposed to happen Dec. 1. The judge also signaled he is likely to eventually side with the business groups, though it’s not clear when that ruling will come. As of right now, the case is proceeding on two fronts, in both the district court and appeals court. The only thing that’s known for sure is the litigation will continue past Jan. 20. At that point, the Trump administration could decide to stop defending the rule or not to appeal any judgment against it. Fearing that outcome, the AFL-CIO is trying to intervene in the case, hoping to continue defending the new rule if the Trump administration drops it. The district court hasn’t yet ruled on that motion. https://www.propublica.org/article/how-trump-could-kill-a-plan-to-get-you-overtime-pay Share this: Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Related January 13th, 2017 | News       Eagle Pass Business Journal Copyright | Privacy Policy Send to Email Address Your Name Your Email Address Cancel Post was not sent - check your email addresses!

I was able to baby my car back to Fairfield. I went to a shop on Holiday Lane. I felt comfortable due to having Motel 6 close by. It took three days to get an estimate. We had enough to get a room for five days. When I found the repair cost was more than the value of the car, I decided to donate the car. I went to the bank and withdrew enough to buy a car that I found on Facebook. I met the seller at Walmart where he pulled a gun on me and took every penny. I flagged down one of your highly professional police officers, who refused any assistance other than a very strong lecture of the dangers and risks of using Craigslist. We then became stranded, sleeping in my old car in the old Orchard Supply Hardware parking lot. On our eighth day I made arrangements for a replacement automobile, which I picked up that day. Your homeless officer came by on the morning of the eighth day. He was extremely courteous and helpful, he understood the situation and told me to contact him the next morning if I ran into any problems. That night another officer came by threatening to tow my car and arrest us if we didn’t leave. He claimed they had complaints of us harassing people in that lot; he claimed businesses had called. I questioned people at every store: Nobody called. A person at one of the stores told us that this officer hates homeless and is constantly moving them on. Only thing is I am not homeless and his words showed me how little some of your officers care. I was a frequent visitor to your city, but not anymore. I am 58 years old and was returning from medical treatment at the University of California, Davis, which I do every two weeks. I do not stop in Fairfield for any reason. I really hope that officer’s wife, mother or daughter doesn’t become stranded: He might be a little more sympathetic to the situation.

She claims to live in Campbell and that she isn't homeless. When the car broke down, it would have been cheaper to Uber herself back to Campbell, rather than stay at Motel 6. Motel 6 is about $60 a night, plus sales and hotel taxes. This makes no sense.Reply | Report abusive comment pcmcJanuary 13, 2017 - 5:48 pm What an eventful 8 days in Fairfield. Did she get the name of the 2nd officer who wanted to have her car towed at OSH. Walmart has excellent security cameras in the parking lot. I don't remember hearing/reading about a gunman robbing a woman in October 2016 over a car sales transaction gone awry. Which is it: Facebook or Craigslist where she found her new car.Reply | Report abusive comment ResidentJanuary 13, 2017 - 6:00 pm Moral of the story. Get a AAA membership.Reply | Report abusive comment JagJanuary 13, 2017 - 6:26 pm LOLReply | Report abusive comment Lake ReynoldsJanuary 15, 2017 - 5:08 am Fake news. I work at Walmart and no one asked for video to be pulled. We have great police officers and they would never not take a report for a felony armed robbery.Reply | Report abusive comment Rick WoodJanuary 15, 2017 - 6:57 am DR: Instead of running this potentially defamatory letter, why not try to run down the story?Reply | Report abusive comment Just a thoughtJanuary 15, 2017 - 7:41 am Something seems fishy about the story. Why wouldn't you return home and buy a car there? If you live in Campbell you could take the train to San Jose. Also if you live in South Bay why travel all the way to Sacramento for medical treatment. There is UCSF which is closer if you need a research hospital.Reply | Report abusive comment watchingfromthebushesJanuary 15, 2017 - 7:56 am This is a lie. Fairfield police would never interfere with or attempt to impede illegal activity. Unless there was a grant, reward or photographer nearby.Reply | Report abusive comment Time for TruthJanuary 15, 2017 - 8:01 am And her three-legged dog who is blind in one eye answers to the name Lucky.Reply | Report abusive comment The truth hurts sometimesJanuary 15, 2017 - 8:54 am This does sound very made up, I thought they donated the car on day 3. But then drove it to the OSH parking lot?Reply | Report abusive comment GeezJanuary 15, 2017 - 10:56 am I hope it is a made up story because I would hate to think it was true. If indeed it is than Fairfield has a bigger problem than anyone wants to admit.Reply | Report abusive comment GJanuary 15, 2017 - 12:28 pm This story is worse than the houses in Chicago. Just shot full of holes. I wonder if that's even a real name.Reply | Report abusive comment Recent Articles Sports on TV for Monday-Tuesday, Jan. 16-17, 2017 King’s shift from dreamer to radical resonates for activists Thousands rally to resist Republican health law repeal drive This date in sports history for Jan. 16 The bald and the bold: Eagles’ resurgence comes at a price Secret WWI telegram holds lessons for today, historians say Ski report for Monday, Jan. 16, 2017 Chicago police officer fatally shoots fleeing gunman John Lewis books sell out on Amazon day after Trump’s tweets Curry, Warriors ready for another Cavs rematch Cutest captain: Sea lion caught in fishing gear hops on boat Officer uses tourniquet to save motorcyclist with leg injury Owner of dog with severed leg may face criminal charges Officials: Unfilled border tunnels in Mexico a security risk Photos: Rush Ranch Wilderness Survival Course What you need to know now about the upcoming tax season Facebook introduces measures to tackle fake news in Germany Vietnam doc makes Ken Burns, Trent Reznor partners ‘Get Smart’ actor Dick Gautier dead at 85 ‘Hidden Figures’ keeps orbit at top; Affleck, Scorsese flop Subscribe via Email Enter your email address to subscribe and receive notifications of new posts by email.

Here’s what we know about the Nintendo Switch Posted Jan 13, 2017 by Brian Heater (@bheater) 0 SHARES Next Story Nintendo talks Switch launch titles, price point and lessons learned from the Wii U What? The Nintendo Switch, the convertible console formally known as the NX. The product walks the line between a home and portable console, courtesy of a docking tablet and a pair of detachable controllers that work in a number of different configurations. It also features out-of-the-box multiplayer functionality, connecting up to eight devices via Wi-Fi. How much? The U.S. MSRP for the system is $299. That’s a fairly high price point for a company like Nintendo that has found a lot of success undercutting the competition. It does put it in line with Wii U’s launch price, though that ultimately seemed like a misfire for the company, which cut the cost by $50 the following summer. When can I get one? If you missed the early availability at Target, Best Buy and Walmart — bad news, it seems to be sold out for now. It’s starting to feel like the NES Classic all over again. But hopefully Nintendo will have its ducks in a row by the time the system launches for real at retail on March 3. And according to Darrell, you don’t really have a choice in the matter. What’s in the box? The system is launching with two SKUs here in the States — but the contents are essentially the same, the only distinction being the color of the Joy-Con — in one configuration they’re dark gray (matching the rest of the system), in another, a more colorful, Mario-themed blue and red. #NintendoSwitch arrives on March 3. Here’s what’s in the box. pic.twitter.com/ZGiz0y5QKd — Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) January 13, 2017 Here’s what you get for your hard-earned cash: 1 Nintendo Switch Console (i.e. the tablet) 1 Dock 2 Joy-Con controllers (left and right) 1 Adapter 1 Joy-Con Grip 1 HDMI cable 2 Joy-Con straps 0 Games What games will be available at launch? There will only be two Nintendo-developed games at launch: the long-awaited new Zelda game, Breath of the Wild and 1-2 Switch (apparently initially intended as a Wii U title), a brand new title that’s actually a collection of mini-games designed to showcase the system’s creative control scheme. Among the 1-2 Switch games is a dual-style shooting game, which, like the rest of its contents, is intended to be played with players facing toward one another, rather than the screen. Also available at launch are the third-party titles Skylanders Imaginators (Activision) and Just Dance 2017 (Ubisoft). Each offers its own interesting bit of gameplay; the former utilizing the series’ customary toys-to-life figures, the latter using full-body dance controls. Take a look at a sampling of titles for #NintendoSwitch from Nintendo and our third party partners coming this year with more on the way! pic.twitter.com/aYSizTQDsS — Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) January 13, 2017 What’s coming? Nintendo of America President Reggie Fils-Aimé noted onstage in New York today that the company is working with 50 developers to bring around 80 titles to the console. For now, we’ve only seen a fraction of those announced, though many were on hand at today’s event. Here’s what we can expect in the March/spring time frame: Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Has Been Heroes I Am Setsuna Sonic Mania Lego City Undercover Arms Super Bomberman R Snipperclips: Cut it Out, Together! (This will be available as a download) Splatoon 2, NBA 2K18 and Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim will be available in the fall/summer and Super Mario Odyssey will arrive in time for the holidays. Games will run $60 a pop. Here are a bunch of trailers to tide you over.

I’m glad you asked. The console/tablet has a 6.2-inch 720p touchscreen. The resolution gets better when docked, outputting at 1080p on a screen through an HDMI connection. Inside, you’ll find a fairly anemic 32GB of storage, augmented via microSD cards and a custom NVIDIA Tegra processor. The battery estimates are pretty broad — between 2.5 and six hours as a portable console, game dependent. Zelda, for example, falls toward the lower end of the spectrum at around three hours. The Joy-Con controllers should last considerably longer as a standalone — at around 20 hours a piece. The system charges while docked or via the USB-C port on the go. What about getting online? The company will be launching an online subscription service akin to the Xbox One and PlayStation 4. It will be free at launch for a limited time, with an as of yet unannounced monthly fee kicking in during the fall. The company will be offering access to NES and Super Nintendo games via the service, with more content and features set to be announced in the future. Is it fun? Yeah, it’s pretty fun. Mario Kart is great. Did Nintendo learn its lessons from the Wii U? Yes and no. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Nintendo Founded 1889 Overview Nintendo is a Japanese multinational consumer electronics company that develops game consoles.

Debra Clayton By Robert Ray and Nick Valencia, CNN Updated 9:01 AM ET, Fri January 13, 2017 Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. JUST WATCHED Slain Orlando officer was community activist Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Slain Orlando officer was community activist 02:17 Story highlights Master Sgt. Debra Clayton cared deeply about Orlando's youth "Everything she worked for, she died for," her son says Watch "New Day" and "CNN Newsroom" each Friday to see inspiring stories of officers going above and beyond the call of duty. Orlando, Florida (CNN)The legacy of Master Sgt. Debra Clayton is one of compassion, hope, and inspiration. "She was a police officer, but she was a community activist. She believed in helping people and her hand was always out to help you," said Jack Williams, one of Clayton's closest friends. Clayton, 42, died Monday morning, shot and killed outside a Walmart by a suspect on the run. She was one of two officers Orlando lost that day. A few hours later, Norman Lewis, a deputy first class with the Orange County Sheriff's Office, was killed in an vehicle accident while searching for Clayton's assailant. JUST WATCHED 2 officers dead in Orlando manhunt Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH 2 officers dead in Orlando manhunt 01:14 Clayton grew up in Orlando. She went on to the University of Central Florida and received a master's degree. She is being remembered for her service to the community, intelligence and passion to bring people together. She had worked for the police department for 17 years. Read More At a vigil just two days after Clayton's death, hundreds lit candles, sang, wept and paid respect to a woman they knew as a living hero. "She was a good-hearted person, and she always wanted what was best for anybody," said a tearful Ashley Thomas, Clayton's sister. This loss only strengthens our resolve to fight for justice. Sgt. Clayton grew up in this area and made it her life's work to protect it. pic.twitter.com/4r1ZVj5JLe— Orlando Police (@OrlandoPolice) January 9, 2017 Johnny, the 21-year-old son of Clayton, had a message about his mother: "She was the prime example, everything she worked for, she died for." The past several years were troubling for Clayton. Tensions between the black community and police in cities across the country inspired her to speak directly to Orlando neighborhoods, hoping to mend the divide. Sgt. Clayton was extremely active with @pkzorlando. She loved working with kids and they loved her too! Rest peacefully, Sarge. pic.twitter.com/Xfpm4ctiqP— Orlando Police (@OrlandoPolice) January 9, 2017 "The police are here to help you. We are not here to hurt you; we are here to help you," she told dozens of residents this past summer at an Orlando Police Department event. At a wreath-laying ceremony for Clayton, police Chief John Mina talked emotionally about her commitment to unite Orlando. "Great, great police officer. Great leader in our agency, really led by example with the things she did in our community," Mina said. Many have asked how they can help. There's a fund for Master Sgt. Clayton's family. This is the ONLY official fund. https://t.co/QfjYmY3nrg pic.twitter.com/ih2RQxurhI— Orlando Police (@OrlandoPolice) January 10, 2017 So much of Clayton's legacy is of service. In 2015, she helped chaperone two busloads of Orlando-area youngsters who went to Washington as part of the anti-violence Million Youth Peace March. The past several years, she also helped with a "Stop the Violence" rally, an annual vigil that commemorates the people in Orlando and Orange County who have died in the past year from gun violence.

"Just thinking about her. I'm going to miss her, I'm going to miss her." The funeral for Clayton is set for 2 p.m. Saturday at First Baptist Church in Orlando.

Bean board member says anti-Trump boycotts are ‘smokescreen’ for something much bigger Tré Goins-Phillips Jan 13, 2017 5:22 pm Image source: Fox Business Network 157 Follow Share Tweet The granddaughter of L.L. Bean’s founder, board member and co-owner Linda Bean, financially supported President-elect Donald Trump’s campaign, and now Trump’s opponents are boycotting her company. But Bean is calling the boycott against her company a “smokescreen” for anti-Trump protesters’ real intentions. In Bean’s view, the real goal behind the demonstrations is to kill jobs at L.L. Bean and 39 other retailers — including Macy’s, Walmart and Amazon — that the group #GrabYourWallet is encouraging people to boycott. According to its website, #GrabYourWallet is a movement that began in October on Twitter in response to the “Access Hollywood” tapes depicting Trump’s lewd comments about women. The campaign is devoted to “the flexing of consumer power in favor of a more respectful, inclusive society.” The #GrabYourWallet website is encouraging people to contact the brands they list and tell their employees: “Hi. I’m a customer/fan of your brand. Unfortunately, I’ll no longer be able to shop there because you do business with the Trump family. If you were to no longer do so I would consider returning as a customer. Please communicate my feedback to store management.” There are ulterior motives, though, according to Bean. “It’s the bullies who want to go after, basically, our jobs,” she told Fox Business Network host Stuart Varney Friday afternoon. “I believe it’s just a smokescreen because the effect of a boycott is to kill jobs — boycotts and bullies kill jobs.” She did not explain why, in her view, her employees’ jobs were specifically being targeted. Earlier this week, it was revealed that Bean contributed $60,000 of her own money to a PAC supporting Trump. While she said the donation was personal and not in any way connected to the family business, the Federal Election Commission said the contribution exceeded the PAC’s individual donor limit of $5,000. According to the Portland Press-Herald, the FEC told the PAC in a notice that it would face punitive action or an audit if it did not respond to inquiries about Bean’s contribution. The group responded to the notice last week by amending their initial disclosure, and indicating that it used its funds on signs, Facebook, radio ads at 30-second TV spots in support of Trump. Bean said she has received no notification from the FEC indicating she broke the law. The L.L Bean heiress stated in a Thursday Fox News interview that the ensuing boycotts of her popular company “un-American.” Responding to her appearance on TV, Trump, who takes the oath of office next Friday, tweeted his support for the clothing brand and encouraged his followers to buy L.L. Bean products. Thank you to Linda Bean of L.L.Bean for your great support and courage. People will support you even more now. Buy L.L.Bean. @LBPerfectMaine — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 12, 2017 Trump’s decision to publicly endorse the brand only served to further frustrate Bean’s detractors. Many on social media slammed the president-elect for using his enormous platform to advertise for a private company. @realDonaldTrump so now you're starting to advertise through your account???? — Christoph A. Karlo (@chkarlo) January 12, 2017 @realDonaldTrump @LBPerfectMaine So unlike every other president…you only support the people who like you…not ALL AMERICANS. — Tony Posnanski (@tonyposnanski) January 12, 2017 What in God's name is this nonsense, @realDonaldTrump? You're not an ad agency. https://t.co/74iwsOL8lp — Evan O'Connell ❄️ (@evanoconnell) January 12, 2017 .@realDonaldTrump Oh awesome, the incoming President of the United States is running ads for political supporters. pic.twitter.com/Ayk1Fizxci — Fusion (@Fusion) January 12, 2017 Bean, for her part, said L.L. Bean steers clear of making any sort of political endorsements or donations. “It was not the company donation. It was my personal donation and the company itself stays politically neutral,” she insisted, adding that her company has a “no endorsing” policy when it comes to politics. However, despite the headaches, Bean said she would “absolutely” do it all over again because she sees it “as an opportunity.” “Every one of these setbacks gives you an opportunity to say how great America is,” Bean explained. “How great it is to be free to vote for your own candidate and set the record straight.” When Varney asked her what it is like to be a conservative in the “upper-echelons of business,” Bean sad it is “a strange paradox,” citing the way the stock market rallied following Trump’s surprise victory on Nov. 8. “Those are the guys that are probably right there. Are they saying one thing and putting their money in another place?” she wondered, later acknowledging that she has always been “a little bit of a rebel” when it came to her political leanings. In the end, she said she supports Trump because of his pledge to create jobs once he’s in the White House.

Finance Search Global markets mixed as Wall Street treads waterAFP – Fri, Jan 13, 2017 11:35 PM AEDT Related Content View Photo London's benchmark FTSE 100 index reached a record high January 13, 2017 Global stock indices finished mainly higher on Friday as Wall Street ended split despite healthy bank profits and another record Nasdaq close. Europe's main stock markets were cheered by a steady opening on Wall Street and solid bank earnings reports from JP Morgan Chase and Bank of America. "The FTSE 100 notched up another all-time high to round off a record-breaking week of gains," said Jasper Lawler at London Capital Group. "Shares of UK-listed banks including Barclays, RBS and HSBC responded positively to the US results." Meanwhile the Euro Stoxx 50 and the CAC 40 in Paris both added 1.2 percent while Frankfurt rose 0.9 percent. However, as afternoon approached in New York, the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average began to sputter, dragged lower partly by retail giant Walmart, which saw shares drop 1.2 percent. Commerce Department figures released early Friday showed retail sales at US department stores fell 0.6 percent in December as consumers increasingly shop online. The Dow finished down less than 0.1 percent at 19,885.73, while the broader S&P 500 gained 0.2 percent and the tech-heavy Nasdaq rose 0.5 percent to reach its sixth record finish in seven trading sessions. Equities had retreated Thursday on investor disappointment over a lack of policy detail from US President-elect Donald Trump, and following allegations of emissions cheating at Fiat Chrysler. Chris Low of FTN Financial said Friday's mixed finish on Wall Street could have been due partly to reduced volume as traders left work early ahead of a US holiday weekend. He also noted bank profits were buoyed by strong trading revenue. "It has been a very long time since we've seen better-than-expected trading revenues," said Low. Meanwhile, the FTSE's record-breaking run has been driven by sterling weakness due to ongoing uncertainty over Brexit. British Prime Minister Theresa May on Tuesday will set out the long-awaited approach the government will take before triggering article 50, starting a two-year process that will take Britain out of the EU. "If the Prime Minister confirms the UK will leave the single market in a 'Hard Brexit', the British pound could drop below 1.20 against the dollar," LCG's Lawler said. - China trade 'obstacles' - In the eurozone, French investors appeared to take in their stride news that Renault is being investigated for possible emissions cheating as the so-called "dieselgate" scandal that engulfed German giant Volkswagen spread to other auto makers. But Renault shares took a hit and ended the day 2.9 percent lower. Earlier in Asia, there was muted reaction to end-of-the-year data from China showing the world's number-two economy was still struggling on the trade front. Hong Kong added 0.5 percent but Shanghai closed down 0.2 percent with little excitement over news that Chinese exports fell more than expected last month, while imports came in largely as expected. For 2016, exports fell 7.7 percent and imports dropped 5.5 percent. "There remain some obstacles facing China's foreign trade development," customs spokesman Huang Songping told reporters, adding the international trading environment was "severe and complex". - Key figures around 2200 GMT - New York - Dow: FLAT at 19,911.40 points (close) New York - S&P 500: UP 0.2 percent at 2,274.64 (close) New York - Nasdaq: UP 0.5 percent at 5,574.12 (close) London - FTSE 100: UP 0.6 percent at 7,337.81 (close) Frankfurt - DAX 30: UP 0.9 percent at 11,629.18 (close) Paris - CAC 40: UP 1.2 percent at 4,922.49 (close) EURO STOXX 50: UP 1.2 percent at 3,324.24 (close) Tokyo - Nikkei 225: UP 0.8 percent at 19,287.28 (close) Shanghai - Composite: DOWN 0.2 percent at 3,112.76 (close) Hong Kong - Hang Seng: UP 0.5 percent at 22,937.38 (close) Euro/dollar: UP at $1.0639 from $1.0614 Pound/dollar: UP at $1.2190 from $1.2163 Dollar/yen: DOWN at 114.53 yen from 114.75 yen Oil - West Texas Intermediate: DOWN 64 cents at $52.37 per barrel Oil - Brent North Sea: DOWN 56 cents at $55.45 Top Stories » Woolworths hires new supermarkets bossAAP Woolworths Group has appointed long-standing Tesco executive Claire Peters as managing director of its supermarkets … NAB hikes many fixed home loan ratesAAP PM may rush trade vote to persuade USAAP Sirtex shares up and down after CEO axedAAP Sponsored  On This Site HOME NEWS & OPINION TAX TIME 2016 INVESTING MY PORTFOLIOS PERSONAL FINANCE VIDEO Expert Opinion ALSO ON YAHOO7 Mail Stocks & Shares Forum Meet Single Women Meet Single Men TV Guide Easy Recipe Ideas Go Travelling Tips To Great Sex Breaking News Find Your Dream Car Weather Forecast Find A Job All Yahoo7 Services » Trending Now Gabba Test Toyota Amber Sherlock Budget Rent a Car Kamiyah Mobley iPad Obamacare Perth Accommodation Trump Clinton Online car insurance quote Help / Suggestions Privacy Terms Quotes are real-time for NASDAQ, NYSE, and NYSEAmex when available.

Its location on Pershing Drive is complemented by over a million square feet of surrounding retail including national and big box retailers such as Wal-Mart, Lowe’s, Target, Home Depot, and BJ’s Wholesale Club. Pershing Square shares a signalized intersection with the 133,310 square foot ShopRite Plaza and shares a parking lot with Planet Fitness in the adjoining Red Raider Plaza. Willing Biddle, President and CEO of Urstadt Biddle Properties Inc. said, “We are pleased to add Aldi to our list of supermarket anchors and acquire a property at which a majority of the tenants built their premises from the ground up, which acts to lower the risk of the investment.” Zach Fox, Vice President of Acquisitions added, “This was an opportunity to acquire an off-market, brand new construction anchored by Aldi, one of the strongest credit tenants in the world. The remainder of the tenants are national brands with safe, long-term leases.” Urstadt Biddle Properties Inc. is a self-administered equity real estate investment trust which owns or has equity interests in 76 properties containing approximately 5.0 million square feet of space.

They will never take my spirit’ Snooker’s biggest star is now a traveller, raconteur, intensely political and pushing at fresh boundaries – and he’s happier for what he is finding Ronnie O’Sullivan is now politically engaged and says inequality disgusts him in life and in snooker. He says he would not support his son if he chose to play the sport. Photograph: Tim P.

Best thing on the plate. And I’d be all right psychologically too, as Steve Peters would help. It’s a few weeks in the jungle, you’re having a laugh. Some people in this country are living on food stamp, they don’t know where their next meal’s coming from.” Welcome to Ronnie 2.0: traveller, raconteur, intensely political and pushing at fresh boundaries – and liking what he is finding. They say that life begins at 40. O’Sullivan is living proof. “I was just unhappy before,” he admits. “But I didn’t know anything else beyond potting balls. I was scared to break out”. But now, aged 41, he is doing so with a vengeance. Last year he was on the road for four months straight, travelling to China to coach and play the odd game of snooker, and to the US to film Rocket Ronnie’s American Hustle, a four-episode travelogue in which he discovers the history of pool, which will be shown on British TV this month. He’s also doing punditry for Eurosport, and has even taken up boxing. “Just with a few old boys,” he says. “No one takes it too seriously. I wouldn’t get in there with a psychopath. I just do it for the fitness.” I spent 10 days in bed, watching TV, some darts, loads of Netflix. I had a great time. Just chilled out However, before his opening round match against Liang Wenbo in the Masters on Sunday he has a confession. “I took Christmas off which I never normally do,” he says. “I spent 10 days in bed, watching TV, some darts, loads of Netflix. I had a great time. Just chilled out. I haven’t really done a lot of practice but I will try my nuts off against Liang and if I win I’ll have four more days to prepare and maybe my game will come.” O’Sullivan, the defending Masters champion, knows he will be roared on by the sell-out 2,000 crowd at Alexandra Palace. And it is clear that he hugely appreciates being regarded as a working-class hero. But increasingly, he finds that he wants to do more: he wants to speak out at what he feels are the widening injustices in society. “I just think: ‘How bad is it when the world is brought to its knees and not one person got punished for it?’ There’s no jobs. No jobs in this country or America. There’s a lot of people on food stamps over there. Meanwhile, the boss of Walmart gets a $20m salary or whatever it is. It’s just wrong. There’s too much of a divide. People can’t afford to fill their fridge, never mind buy their son a pair of trainers. It’s sad. People just want, want, want, take, take, take. “We are all human beings, we all have a purpose in life, we all want to enjoy this time on the planet, there is enough in the world for everyone in the world to have the basic needs without feeling under depression. I believe a lot of our illnesses and struggles and suicides and drug addictions and whatever is brought on by hopelessness.” O’Sullivan is warming to his theme now. “I come from a working class background. My parents worked hard and got up the ladder. In the 80s you could do that. But since they took away the unions and people power, people are fucked, basically. They have nowhere to go. The more you crush someone, the less hope they’ve got. They become numbed-down and they give up. People give up, that’s what happens. You kill them so much that they think ‘Fuck this, we can’t win.’” O’Sullivan talks about how much he admires Ed Miliband and talks fondly of going up with him to visit his Doncaster constituency and hanging about with “proper, working-class people”. I can’t relate to bankers sitting there, fucking drinking wine and splashing money like it’s going out of fashion “I can’t relate to a bunch of bankers sitting there, fucking drinking wine and splashing money like it’s going out of fashion,” he confesses. “It’s obscene, it makes me feel sick. I don’t like being around that kind of behaviour. It makes me feel disgusted.” He sees similar injustices going on in the game of snooker. For despite there being more tournaments, those who get knocked out in the early rounds now struggle to make any sort of living. “I’m not going to support a system that doesn’t benefit the bottom-ranked players,” he says. “There’s no trickle down. All the top players get everything and those at the bottom are in poverty, keeping them in debt. “Snooker, unfortunately, isn’t like golf, football and tennis where the bottom players can be sustained. In snooker, a lot of players can’t afford a pair of trainers for their kid, they can’t afford to buy the train ticket for a tournament. They can’t afford the hotel room. They are waiting for someone to lose and then ask for your hotel room. How is that right? How can that be right for a good snooker player who has devoted all his life? Then you see board members flying business class, drinking red wine, schmoozing, wearing nice suits, saying they are doing wonderful things for the game and it’s never been in a better place.” O’Sullivan cites the case of the Irish player Fergal O’Brien, a tournament winner who he says he is struggling to stay on the tour. He believes a player ranked 32 in the world would be on £30,000 a year, after paying tax and their expenses. “It’s not bad but those between 33-128 in the world are not making a good living.” O’Sullivan clearly has little time for World Snooker but says he won’t antagonise “the people who run things” because “they are looking for any little excuse to throw the book at you.” To make sure he does not have to deal with them directly, O’Sullivan now employs someone to handle all his dealings with the game’s governing body. “I’ve told them you are not allowed to email me. You have to go through someone else and we will keep it professional and keep that distance. I ain’t going to accept the bullshit. I can’t help it – if I smell something I say it’s bullshit.” “I know how they try to bring certain people down, but they will never take my soul. They will never take my spirit. I just won’t have it. My favourite film was Braveheart and as a character he signalled everything to me, which was freedom. We all should have freedom and that’s what I believe in and no one is going to take my freedom.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Ronnie O’Sullivan hopes to defend his Masters title at Alexandra Palace, starting on Sunday. Photograph: Dan Mullan/Getty Images When young players tell him they want to become snooker players, how does he respond? “I tell them no every time,” he replies, shaking his head. “If my son – who turns 10 in June – chooses to play snooker, I’ve told him he won’t get support. That’s the deal. If you want to be in motor racing or tennis, or you want to be a doctor or lawyer or want to go and study, whatever, you get my support. But anything with snooker, I’m going to have to tell you that you are on your own.” O’Sullivan recently watched the documentary I am Bolt, and expresses his deep admiration for Tiger Woods in our interview. But when asked whether he is in their bracket, as a naturally gifted sporting genius, he hesitates. “I just do my best,” he replies. “I know I can perform to a high level and when I don’t, I’m prepared to tough it out more than I was before. I love to compete.” As our hour talking comes to an end O’Sullivan is still chewing the fat, despite having been up until 2.30am the previous night playing in an Ireland versus England legends exhibition match and having had to get up at 6am to get the flight back from County Kildare. He seems in a good place. “Snooker’s the bit I don’t really like,” he admits. “But since doing all this other stuff, I started coming out of myself. I’m a lot happier. I thought, ‘I want to be happy now. I want to have a laugh. I don’t want the grind, the treadmill.’ And I’m having an absolute ball.” More interviews Topics Ronnie O'Sullivan Snooker Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close Reuse this content View all comments > Order by newest oldest recommendations Show 25 25 50 100 All Threads collapsed expanded unthreaded Loading comments… Trouble loading?

Posted 13 Jan 2017 20:35 Updated 14 Jan 2017 08:55 Traders work on the floor at the close of trading at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in Manhattan, New York City, U.S., December 28, 2016. REUTERS/Andrew Kelly Enlarge Caption  Email More A A REUTERS: An increase in Facebook pushed the Nasdaq to a record high on Friday and the S&P 500 also rose after major U.S. banks kicked off the fourth-quarter earnings season with strong results. Wall Street has surged since President-elect Donald Trump's unexpected election victory on optimism he will cut corporate taxes, spend on infrastructure and deregulate banks. With stocks trading at price-to-earnings valuations well above historical averages, many investors believe further gains will depend on S&P 500 companies handing in strong report cards over the next several weeks. Major banks on Friday did not disappoint: Bank of America , JPMorgan and Wells Fargo all posted quarterly profits above analysts' expectations. They also expressed optimism about 2017 in their first public comments about earnings since Trump won the election in November. Their shares surged over 2 percent but later gave up most of those gains. Wells Fargo ended 1.36 percent higher and JPMorgan added 0.53 percent. The S&P financial sector has jumped about 17 percent since the election, far outpacing the S&P 500's 6-percent rise. "Earnings are key going forward, and we're off to a decent start," said Mike Baele, managing director with the Private Client Reserve of U.S. Bank in Portland, Oregon. The Dow dipped marginally, with Wal-Mart Stores and other consumer stocks down after a report showed U.S. retail sales and core retail sales increased less than expected in December. Trading volumes were light, with financial markets closed on Monday for Martin Luther King Jr. Day. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.48 percent to a record-high close of 5,574.12, bringing its gain so far this year to 3.55 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.03 percent to 19,885.73, while the S&P 500 gained 0.18 percent to 2,274.64. For the week, the Dow fell 0.4 percent, the S&P 500 shed 0.1 percent and the Nasdaq gained 1 percent. The biggest boost to the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq on Friday was provided by Facebook , which jumped 1.36 percent after Raymond James upgraded the stock. The combined profit of S&P 500 companies is expected to have risen 6.2 percent in the fourth quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The S&P 500 is trading at 17 times expected earnings, compared to its 10-year average of 14, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. "We've come a long way very quickly so there's scope for a pullback, but overall the outlook for 2017 is relatively positive," said Jon Adams, senior investment strategist at BMO Global Asset Management. Bank stocks will stay in favor with investors as long as earnings reports in the coming week keep show an improving profit outlook while investors wait to see if Trump lives up to his campaign promises. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.69-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.34-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 31 new 52-week highs and three new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 126 new highs and 14 new lows. About 5.8 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, lower than the 6.4 billion average in the last 20 sessions.

By Hector Nunns / Published 14th January 2017 GETTY Ronnie O'Sullivan says he may venture into politics He believes the divide between the haves and the have-nots has never been greater. And as he starts his bid for a record seventh Masters title at Alexandra Palace tomorrow 41-year-old O’Sullivan is itching to get involved and try to make a difference. The five-time world champion says the country is crying out for working class heroes to speak for the masses. “Something’s just not right, there is an imbalance in this country and with one bad decision you don’t see the effects of it until later,” he said. “There are no decent jobs now for so many people, not here and not in America. “A lot of people with jobs at Walmart are on food stamps while the CEO is on $20m a year. “Be an MP? If I was good enough and thought I could do a good enough job and give the time” Snooker star Ronnie O'Sullivan “Maybe I would consider getting involved in politics - I would like to do some good. “I have become much more aware – and I would love to get involved. “Be an MP? If I was good enough and thought I could do a good enough job and give the time. “But I would never be a Tory, put it that way. I have nothing against people who work hard, do well and create jobs, I just don’t like people at the top abusing the system. “I spent a day with Labour leader Ed Miliband in his constituency (Doncaster) before the last election, going to community places for kids where they got to play pool and hang out. GETTY Could Ronnie O'Sullivan even become Prime Minister? “I went to a school, and an old mining club where they played their snooker and darts – proper working-class people. “I could relate to them, but not bunch of bankers sitting there drinking wine and splashing money like it’s going out of fashion. That is obscene and makes me sick. “People power has gone, the unions have gone, people are on zero contract hours and basically they are knackered. “The more you crush someone the less hope they have, they become numb and give up after they have been killed so much. “You can have your protests but not enough people stand together. If they did, then something would change. At some point, that might happen.” Related videos Ronnie O'Sullivan gets floored trying virtual reality snooker Ronnie O'Sullivan gets floored trying virtual reality snooker Mark Selby and Neil Robertson take on the Crazy Snooker challenge Mark Selby and Neil Robertson take on the Crazy Snooker challenge UNBELIEVABLE 500ft snooker trick shot Bar in Bristol set up amazing 500ft snooker trick shot But for the moment he’s still playing snooker, and the defending Masters champion faces practice partner Liang Wenbo of China in front of a sell-out 2,000 crowd.

By Justin Elliott, ProPublica click to enlarge Jeffrey C Lowe Donald Trump ran for president as the billionaire who would champion working people. As the president-elect put it in one of the major economic speeches of his campaign: "Too many of our leaders have forgotten that it's their duty to protect the jobs, wages and well-being of American workers before any other consideration." One of the first tests of Trump's pledge to help workers will come in how his administration handles the complicated rules that govern who has the right to time-and-a-half overtime pay. Business groups and Republican state attorneys general sued to stop an Obama administration rule that would expand who gets overtime pay. A federal court temporarily blocked the rule in November. Now the Trump administration will decide whether to continue defending the rule in court. At stake is the possibility of overtime pay for about 4 million workers around the country. To get a sense of how big a deal that is: The still-sketchy deal to save factory jobs at a Carrier plant in Indiana — the subject of numerous Trump tweets and extensive media coverage — affected 1,000 or fewer workers. Here's how overtime works now Most employees in the country have the legal right to time-and-a-half overtime pay if they work more than 40 hours in a week. But there's a major exception to that: white-collar workers. So who qualifies as a white-collar worker? The government has a test for that. To be considered a white-collar worker who does not qualify for overtime pay: You have to be paid a salary and not by the hour. You have to make more than $455 per week — the equivalent of $23,660 per year. And you have to work in certain types of jobs, including executive, administrative or professional positions. That has nothing to do with your title, but rather is defined by the nature of your job. For example, executive employees have to, among other things, supervise other workers. Here are more details on how it all works. Labor advocates say some employers have been playing games with who is considered a white-collar worker. There have been a series of lawsuits and settlements outlining how, for example, the dollar store industry classifies employees as managers to avoid paying overtime. Some workers classified as managers spent much of their time doing the same manual labor as their subordinates. Halliburton in 2015 agreed to pay $18 million in back wages for overtime to about 1,000 employees who worked as pipe recovery specialists and drilling advisers, among other jobs. The company acknowledged it had improperly classified those workers as exempt from the overtime rules. Walmart paid a $4.8 million settlement in 2012 for not paying security guards and other employees overtime they were due. The Obama administration argues that the current overtime salary threshold, which was last raised in 2004 and has been eroded by inflation, is outdated. According to the Department of Labor, in 1975, 62 percent of full-time salaried workers were eligible for overtime based on their pay. That compares to just 7 percent today. The Obama rule would make another 4 million people eligible for overtime The most important change made by the Obama administration was raising the salary threshold below which you generally have the right to overtime pay, regardless of your job duties. The new level — which is currently on hold because of the pending lawsuit — is $913 per week, or $47,476 per year. That's double the old standard of $23,660 per year. The Department of Labor has calculated that the new rule could benefit 4.2 million workers around the country. The affected workers would either start getting overtime for any time worked over 40 hours a week, or their salaries would have to be increased above the new threshold. Business groups opposing the rule, most prominently the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, argued that "the salary threshold is going to result in significant new labor costs and cause many disruptions in how work gets done" including by reducing "workplace flexibility, remote electronic access to work, and opportunities for career advancement." Some employers, acting on the expectation that the rule would go into effect, have already raised salaries. The biggest name on the list is Walmart, which bumped starting pay for some managers from $45,000 to $48,500 in order to exempt them from overtime pay. Politico reported that other employers that had promised pay increases, including several universities, have now cancelled the raises in light of the uncertainty around whether the rule will actually go in effect. (Have you heard anything from your employer about overtime changes? Tell us about it.) Trump's pick for labor secretary has attacked the idea of expanding overtime, and the president-elect himself seems skeptical When Trump was asked about the rule in August, he spoke of "a delay or a carve-out of sorts for our small business owners." It's not clear from his comments that Trump actually knew the details of the pending Obama changes. The Trump transition team didn't response to a request for comment. The Department of Justice also declined to comment about what could happen in the lawsuit after Jan. 20. Andrew Puzder, Trump's pick to be secretary of labor and the CEO of a fast-food company, has spoken out strongly against the overtime rule. In a 2014 Wall Street Journal op-ed, Puzder warned against "rewarding time spent rather than time well spent." "What they lose in overtime pay they gain in the stature and sense of accomplishment that comes from being a salaried manager," Puzder said of workers trying to climb the management ladder. The fate of the rule depends on how things play out in a lawsuit that will drag on past the inauguration In September, business groups including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce along with 21 states sued to block the new overtime rule. In late November, a federal judge in Texas temporarily blocked the rule from going into effect, which was supposed to happen Dec. 1. The judge also signaled he is likely to eventually side with the business groups, though it's not clear when that ruling will come. As of right now, the case is proceeding on two fronts, in both the district court and appeals court. The only thing that's known for sure is the litigation will continue past Jan. 20. At that point, the Trump administration could decide to stop defending the rule or not to appeal any judgment against it. Fearing that outcome, the AFL-CIO is trying to intervene in the case, hoping to continue defending the new rule if the Trump administration drops it.

Wall Street has surged since President-elect Trump's unexpected election victory on optimism he will cut corporate taxes, spend on infrastructure and deregulate banks. With stocks trading at price-to-earnings valuations well above historical averages, many investors believe further gains will depend on S&P 500 companies handing in strong report cards over the next several weeks. Major banks on Friday did not disappoint: Bank of America , JPMorgan and Wells Fargo all posted quarterly profits above analysts' expectations. They also expressed optimism about 2017 in their first public comments about earnings since Trump won the election in November. Their shares surged over 2 percent but later gave up most of those gains. Wells Fargo ended 1.36-percent higher and JPMorgan added 0.53 percent. The S&P financial sector has jumped about 17 percent since the election, far outpacing the S&P 500's 6-percent rise. "Earnings are key going forward, and we're off to a decent start," said Mike Baele, managing director with the Private Client Reserve of U.S. Bank in Portland, Oregon. The Dow dipped marginally, with Wal-Mart Stores and other consumer stocks down after a report showed U.S. retail sales and core retail sales increased less than expected in December. Trading volumes were light, with financial markets closed on Monday for Martin Luther King Jr. Day. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.48 percent to a record-high close of 5,574.12 points, bringing its gain so far this year to 3.55 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.03 percent to 19,885.73 points, while the S&P 500 gained 0.18 percent to 2,274.64. For the week, the Dow fell 0.4 percent, the S&P 500 shed 0.1 percent and the Nasdaq gained 1 percent. The biggest boost to the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq on Friday was provided by Facebook, which jumped 1.36 percent after Raymond James upgraded the stock. The combined profit of S&P 500 companies is expected to have risen 6.2 percent in the fourth quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The S&P 500 is trading at 17 times expected earnings, compared to its 10-year average of 14 times expected earnings, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. "We've come a long way very quickly so there's scope for a pullback, but overall the outlook for 2017 is relatively positive," said Jon Adams, senior investment strategist at BMO Global Asset Management. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.69-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.34-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 31 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 126 new highs and 14 new lows. About 5.8 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, lower than the 6.4 billion average in the last 20 sessions.

Current Kentucky state law allows opponents of development projects to file endless appeals. Think back to the West End Wal-Mart and the Omni Project.  In both cases, people attempted to obstruct economic growth in our Commonwealth by using and abusing the court system. They created legal logjams that delayed one project and killed another that would have greatly benefited a neighborhood in dire need of economic investment. It’s time to stop the madness.   A recent bill introduced by Louisville Representative Jerry Miller aims to do just that. The proposed supersedeas bond bill requires a bond to be posted in order to appeal a Circuit Court decision. This ensures the wheels of justice can continue to turn, but provides a deterrent to frivolous lawsuits that hinder economic investment. For years, GLI has advocated for legislation placing limits on appeals and we are encouraged by Representative Miller’s leadership on this vital issue. We must stop delaying the growth of our region. We can protect our history and character while stepping into the 21st century. We simply must adjust our perspective and see change as less of a threat and more of an opportunity. GLI urges lawmakers in Frankfort to send Representative Miller’s bill to Governor Bevin for signature.  Superseadeas… easier done than said, and a better deal for all of Kentucky.   I’m Sarah Davasher-Wisdom of GLI and that’s my Point of View.  WDRB NEWS Home Kentucky News Indiana News National News Entertainment Weather WDRB Traffic Business Sports WDRB in the Morning Keith Kaiser Out and About News Team WDRB-TV Point of View Sales Team Programming Information Gas Prices Contests Events WDRB Jobs Facebook Partners Norton Healthcare WMYO-TV WBRT 1320 AM WBKI-TV 624 W.

Linder By JORDYN REILAND jreiland @shawmedia.com WOODSTOCK – Jurors found a Zion man guilty on Friday of the drug-induced homicide of 21-year-old Danielle Barzyk. Jurors found that James F. Linder sold more than one gram of heroin to Barzyk’s boyfriend, Cody N. Hillier, on Jan. 30, 2015, in Zion. The couple returned to Algonquin and used the drugs at least three times, and just after 1 a.m. Barzyk told Hillier she was having trouble breathing and needed medical attention. Hillier and Barzyk met at a local rehabilitation facility in July 2014 and started dating. Hillier, who took the stand this week, said he and Barzyk relapsed in November 2014 and continued daily usage. When police arrived at the scene, they asked Hillier whether Barzyk had taken anything, and he said she was having an asthma attack. He later told responding officers and emergency personnel that she had taken Vicodin. Barzyk was taken to Advocate Sherman Hospital in Elgin, where she was pronounced dead. Hillier agreed to work with the North Central Narcotics Task force and bought additional heroin from Linder in a controlled narcotics transaction at a Wal-Mart in Zion. Linder was pulled over after the alleged drug deal, and officers located the money Hillier was given to buy the drugs, his wallet, a cellphone and additional cash. Linder was arrested and has since been held in the McHenry County Jail. Hillier previously pleaded guilty in May to unlawful possession and delivery of a controlled substance in this case and was sentenced to probation. He was rearrested in October after violating the terms of his probation. The jury began deliberations shortly before 11:30 a.m. Friday and returned with a verdict about two hours later. During closing arguments, Assistant State’s Attorney Randi Freese asked the jury to hold the defendant accountable. “He profited and preyed on the addiction and disease of Danielle and Cody,” Freese said. Freese said prosecutors proved their case beyond a reasonable doubt because they were able to show that Linder knowingly delivered heroin to Hillier, that the heroin was at least one gram or more, that Barzyk inhaled the heroin and that Barzyk died as a result of the inhalation. Freese said the most convincing evidence in the case against Linder came from his cellphone, which was taken from the defendant when he was arrested. The text messages documented conversations between Hillier and Linder regarding the two heroin purchases. There also were recorded phone calls between the two from Jan. 31, 2015, when Hillier was working with undercover officers. Freese said there was no doubt that Barzyk died of a heroin overdose based on testimony from two forensic pathologists who took the stand this week. “What happened to Danielle could have just as easily happened to Cody. They both used the heroin. … One died; one lived,” Freese said. Mitra Kalelkar and Hillary McElligott, who testified for the prosecution and defense, respectively, generally agreed Barzyk’s primary cause of death was a narcotics overdose. Kalelkar conducted Barzyk’s autopsy days after she died and examined a toxicology report prepared when coming to her conclusion of how Barzyk died. She said Barzyk’s lungs were heavier than normal from a significant amount of fluid and congestion, something she commonly sees in patients who overdose or drown. She also said she was aware of Barzyk’s history of asthma, but did not believe it was what caused her death. Hank Sugden, Linder’s attorney, said in closing arguments that prosecutors did not prove Linder delivered heroin to Hillier nor did they prove Barzyk died of a heroin overdose. Sugden said Barzyk and Hillier were both addicts who were aware of the danger of drugs. Sugden said, referencing Freese’s prior statement, that Hillier lived and Barzyk died not because she overdosed but because of the fact that she had an asthma attack. That was the major difference between the two, he said. McElligott said while she agreed the primary cause of death was related to a heroin overdose, she believed asthma was a major contributing factor. She said someone who is overdosing will appear as though they are falling asleep or passing out, but someone experiencing a severe asthma attack is more likely to gasp for air and be aware they are not breathing properly. Sugden also said prosecutors were unable to prove the heroin sold Jan. 30 was the same as the heroin sold Jan. 31, and could have done so through further testing. In response to Sugden’s statement about quality control, Assistant State’s Attorney John Gibbons said it would have been nearly impossible to do comparative testing because heroin dealers almost always have different product. He said that fact is proven when Linder told Hillier in a recorded phone call that he didn’t have the same stuff as Jan. 30 but had different product he could sell to him. Linder faces 15 to 30 years in prison. Based on previous convictions, he could receive an extended sentence that would result in 30 to 60 years in prison. He will remain in the McHenry County Jail without bond until his sentencing Feb. 24.

Local student, William Van Vliet, has done just that. And he has a pretty good chance of taking home the prestigious award, which is valued at $100,000 over four years of undergraduate study. Van Vliet, a grade 12 student at St. Michael Catholic High School in Kemptville, is “honoured” just to be considered for the award. More than 4,400 students applied this year and 84 finalists were selected nationwide. The Loran Award is considered Canada’s most comprehensive undergraduate scholarship for character, service and leadership. “Even if I don’t win, I’ve already made amazing connections – met amazing people,” said Van Vliet. He attended his first series of interviews for the Loran Award in Ottawa back in December. He will also be at the Loran Scholars Foundation's national selections in Toronto on Feb. 3 and 4. After national selections, the Loran Scholars Foundation will select up to 32 Loran Scholars. If chosen as a Loran Scholar, Van Vliet would be the first ever from Kemptville. If not selected as a scholar, every finalist is eligible to receive a $3,000 finalist award. “I was talking to a former winner and he told me the $100,000 is more so you don’t have financial worries, but the biggest opportunity is the networking,” said Van Vliet. “The Loran Scholars have their own community, like university alumni. Those connections really help you, especially with business commerce, which is what I am interested in.” “This is an opportunity to meet a lot of young leaders,” he continued. To even be mentioned in the same sentence as former winners of the Loran Award is “unbelievable,” he explained. “It’s an achievement to even get this far.” Van Vliet is being considered for the award for spearheading the expansion of the intramural sports program at St. Mike’s. He has also served as captain of various sports teams, including hockey and cross-country, and volunteers as a basketball coach. He began volunteering at the Kemptville District Hospital at the tender age of eight, and has continued to do so for the past decade. “The hospital is our social wellness hub,” he explained. “Being involved with that is very important.” Van Vliet also works part-time as an e-commerce associate at the Kemptville Walmart. “I am part of the Walmart pick-up team. I helped initiate that program and was the only student chosen to do so,” he said. “Having the brick and mortar, and then having the online entity, and bringing that together – I think that’s really intuitive.” Having a strong community is important, he explained. “I wanted to make sure everything I am doing is for the community – be that a school, a hockey team or the community you live in.” He has applied to the University of Toronto, McGill University and Queen’s University, though he has his heart set on Queen’s, where he plans to study business commerce. “My dream job incorporates all I’ve done – community, sports and business,” said Van Vliet. “I would love to be the general manager of an NBA team, because I love basketball, but also because the NBA is the most progressive league in North American sports.” “That being said, that’s a dream job,” he continued. “I really like finance and economics, so maybe work with a bank or agency of some sort. I also enjoy marketing, so if I could combine all those, I always thought that would be cool.” About Loran Scholars Foundation The Loran Scholars Foundation is a national charity that partners with 25 universities to invest in young Canadians who demonstrate character, service and leadership potential. LORAN, short for Long-Range Aid to Navigation, is a system that uses three points (character, service and leadership) to determine one's course for a long journey.

Listener John has already maxed out his workplace retirement account and has no credit card debt. Motley Fool Staff (the_motley_fool) Jan 13, 2017 at 1:38PM In this segment from the Motley Fool Answers podcast, Alison Southwick and Robert Brokamp welcome Sean Gates to the show as they answer listener questions. This time, the team considers the best options for a lump sum of cash when the recipient has already been doing all the right things financially. Should he pay down his mortgage or invest it -- and if invest, then where? A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on Dec. 13, 2016. Alison Southwick: The first one comes to us from John in Pennsylvania. "I recently received a lump sum of money and am wondering what the best thing to do with it would be." Aside from mailing it to us. Robert Brokamp: Of course. Southwick: Motley Fool, 2000 Duke Street, 4th Floor, Alexandria, VA 22314. John writes: "My wife and I already have our emergency fund in place and are maxed out on our workplace retirement contributions and IRAs." Brokamp: Nice. Southwick: "We also don't have any credit card debt." Sean Gates: Woo! Brokamp: Wow! Southwick: Gold star. Brokamp: Yes. Southwick: "We are debating whether to pay down some of our debt or invest the money. Our current debts are a mortgage at 3.375% and two cars (one at 2.49% and one at 2.99%). I know that investing the money would give us the chance to earn a higher rate than our debts charge in interest, but I also like the idea of getting a guaranteed return by paying off some debt. Thanks so much, and I love the podcast." What should John do? Brokamp: Well, the first thing to do is look at the interest rates on the debt. Given what he has said about his financial circumstances, I'm going to assume that he can deduct his mortgage interest, which then says that maybe there's some value to keeping that debt. The rates are very low, so you'd think long term you'd be able to invest that money and exceed the rates of that interest. That said, there is a psychological benefit to paying off debt. I was in this same situation where we got some money and we decided to pay off a car loan. But then what we have decided to do is the money that was going each month to the car loan is now going to go to our kids' 529. So we paid off the debt, but then we're using that as a way to put some more money in savings, as well. Gates: And I think it's a case-by-case basis. There's studies that show that if you have a cash cushion, you're happier, so maybe having that money set aside in a retirement account or in an investable account (just knowing it's there, rather than locked up in a mortgage or in a car payment) is helpful. So there's a lot of different ways to look at it, but I think investing it, especially if you're young, is a good way to go, but you're never offbeat if you pay down debt. Brokamp: Right. Southwick: Sorry. I'm having a hard time figuring out what your answer is. Some people like to go that way. Other people like to go that way. Brokamp: If you were to base it just on long-term, historical numbers ... Gates: Yes ... Brokamp: ... you'd have a higher net worth by investing that money and keeping the debt. The debt is crazy low. I don't expect the stock market to return that mythic 10% annually a year over the long term, but you'd still probably have more money by investing it. That said, if you feel better by paying off the debt, that's not a bad idea. The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy.

Follow Raw Story! Follow @rawstory Donald Trump ran for president as the billionaire who would champion working people. As the president-elect put it in one of the major economic speeches of his campaign: “Too many of our leaders have forgotten that it’s their duty to protect the jobs, wages and well-being of American workers before any other consideration.” One of the first tests of Trump’s pledge to help workers will come in how his administration handles the complicated rules that govern who has the right to time-and-a-half overtime pay. Business groups and Republican state attorneys general sued to stop an Obama administration rule that would expand who gets overtime pay. A federal court temporarily blocked the rule in November. Now the Trump administration will decide whether to continue defending the rule in court. At stake is the possibility of overtime pay for about 4 million workers around the country. To get a sense of how big a deal that is: The still-sketchy deal to save factory jobs at a Carrier plant in Indiana 2014 the subject of numerous Trump tweets and extensive media coverage 2014 affected 1,000 or fewer workers. Here’s how overtime works now Most employees in the country have the legal right to time-and-a-half overtime pay if they work more than 40 hours in a week. But there’s a major exception to that: white-collar workers. So who qualifies as a white-collar worker? The government has a test for that. To be considered a white-collar worker who does not qualify for overtime pay: You have to be paid a salary and not by the hour. You have to make more than $455 per week 2014 the equivalent of $23,660 per year. And you have to work in certain types of jobs, including executive, administrative or professional positions. That has nothing to do with your title, but rather is defined by the nature of your job. For example, executive employees have to, among other things, supervise other workers. Here are more details on how it all works. Labor advocates say some employers have been playing games with who is considered a white-collar worker. There have been a series of lawsuits and settlements outlining how, for example, the dollar store industry classifies employees as managers to avoid paying overtime. Some workers classified as managers spent much of their time doing the same manual labor as their subordinates. Halliburton in 2015 agreed to pay $18 million in back wages for overtime to about 1,000 employees who worked as pipe recovery specialists and drilling advisers, among other jobs. The company acknowledged it had improperly classified those workers as exempt from the overtime rules. Walmart paid a $4.8 million settlement in 2012 for not paying security guards and other employees overtime they were due. The Obama administration argues that the current overtime salary threshold, which was last raised in 2004 and has been eroded by inflation, is outdated. According to the Department of Labor, in 1975, 62 percent of full-time salaried workers were eligible for overtime based on their pay. That compares to just 7 percent today. The Obama rule would make another 4 million people eligible for overtime The most important change made by the Obama administration was raising the salary threshold below which you generally have the right to overtime pay, regardless of your job duties. The new level 2014 which is currently on hold because of the pending lawsuit 2014 is $913 per week, or $47,476 per year. That’s double the old standard of $23,660 per year. The Department of Labor has calculated that the new rule could benefit 4.2 million workers around the country. The affected workers would either start getting overtime for any time worked over 40 hours a week, or their salaries would have to be increased above the new threshold. Business groups opposing the rule, most prominently the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, argued that “the salary threshold is going to result in significant new labor costs and cause many disruptions in how work gets done” including by reducing “workplace flexibility, remote electronic access to work, and opportunities for career advancement.” Some employers, acting on the expectation that the rule would go into effect, have already raised salaries. The biggest name on the list is Walmart, which bumped starting pay for some managers from $45,000 to $48,500 in order to exempt them from overtime pay. Politico reported that other employers that had promised pay increases, including several universities, have now cancelled the raises in light of the uncertainty around whether the rule will actually go in effect. (Have you heard anything from your employer about overtime changes? Tell us about it.) Trump’s pick for labor secretary has attacked the idea of expanding overtime, and the president-elect himself seems skeptical When Trump was asked about the rule in August, he spoke of “a delay or a carve-out of sorts for our small business owners.” It’s not clear from his comments that Trump actually knew the details of the pending Obama changes. The Trump transition team didn’t response to a request for comment. The Department of Justice also declined to comment about what could happen in the lawsuit after Jan. 20. Andrew Puzder, Trump’s pick to be secretary of labor and the CEO of a fast-food company, has spoken out strongly against the overtime rule. In a 2014 Wall Street Journal op-ed, Puzder warned against “rewarding time spent rather than time well spent.” “What they lose in overtime pay they gain in the stature and sense of accomplishment that comes from being a salaried manager,” Puzder said of workers trying to climb the management ladder. The fate of the rule depends on how things play out in a lawsuit that will drag on past the inauguration In September, business groups including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce along with 21 states sued to block the new overtime rule. In late November, a federal judge in Texas temporarily blocked the rule from going into effect, which was supposed to happen Dec. 1. The judge also signaled he is likely to eventually side with the business groups, though it’s not clear when that ruling will come. As of right now, the case is proceeding on two fronts, in both the district court and appeals court. The only thing that’s known for sure is the litigation will continue past Jan. 20. At that point, the Trump administration could decide to stop defending the rule or not to appeal any judgment against it. Fearing that outcome, the AFL-CIO is trying to intervene in the case, hoping to continue defending the new rule if the Trump administration drops it. The district court hasn’t yet ruled on that motion. ProPublica is a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative newsroom. Sign up for their newsletter.

Debra Clayton cared deeply about Orlando's youth "Everything she worked for, she died for," her son says Watch "New Day" and "CNN Newsroom" each Friday to see inspiring stories of officers going above and beyond the call of duty. Orlando, Florida (CNN)The legacy of Master Sgt. Debra Clayton is one of compassion, hope, and inspiration. "She was a police officer, but she was a community activist. She believed in helping people and her hand was always out to help you," said Jack Williams, one of Clayton's closest friends. Clayton, 42, died Monday morning, shot and killed outside a Walmart by a suspect on the run. She was one of two officers Orlando lost that day. A few hours later, Norman Lewis, a deputy first class with the Orange County Sheriff's Office, was killed in an vehicle accident while searching for Clayton's assailant.

She had worked for the police department for 17 years. Read More At a vigil just two days after Clayton's death, hundreds lit candles, sang, wept and paid respect to a woman they knew as a living hero. "She was a good-hearted person, and she always wanted what was best for anybody," said a tearful Ashley Thomas, Clayton's sister. This loss only strengthens our resolve to fight for justice. Sgt.

The past several years were troubling for Clayton. Tensions between the black community and police in cities across the country inspired her to speak directly to Orlando neighborhoods, hoping to mend the divide. Sgt. Clayton was extremely active with @pkzorlando. She loved working with kids and they loved her too! Rest peacefully, Sarge. pic.twitter.com/Xfpm4ctiqP— Orlando Police (@OrlandoPolice) January 9, 2017 "The police are here to help you. We are not here to hurt you; we are here to help you," she told dozens of residents this past summer at an Orlando Police Department event. At a wreath-laying ceremony for Clayton, police Chief John Mina talked emotionally about her commitment to unite Orlando. "Great, great police officer. Great leader in our agency, really led by example with the things she did in our community," Mina said. Many have asked how they can help. There's a fund for Master Sgt. Clayton's family. This is the ONLY official fund. https://t.co/QfjYmY3nrg pic.twitter.com/ih2RQxurhI— Orlando Police (@OrlandoPolice) January 10, 2017 So much of Clayton's legacy is of service. In 2015, she helped chaperone two busloads of Orlando-area youngsters who went to Washington as part of the anti-violence Million Youth Peace March. The past several years, she also helped with a "Stop the Violence" rally, an annual vigil that commemorates the people in Orlando and Orange County who have died in the past year from gun violence.

The company increased investments in its fulfillment centers and in video content in 2016, Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said in a conference call following its third-quarter earnings report last fall. The announcement "shows Amazon's bullish on the U.S. economy," said Andreas Scherer, managing partner at Salto Partners. Although most of the new jobs will be in Amazon's growing number of fulfillment centers, the company's aggressive expansion of its cloud business also "means more jobs for engineers and software developers to run its massive IT infrastructure," he told the E-Commerce Times. Further, Amazon is seeking new ways to handle its own package delivery, which "means significant job opportunities to support the logistics value chain," Scherer said. What About the Robots? Amazon's fulfillment centers are highly automated. The company has deployed at least 45,000 robots in them so far, and plans to continue automating processes. That raises the question of whether the fulfillment center new hires might be replaced by robots. "The short answer: not any time soon," said Seth Lippincott, a senior research analyst at Nucleus Research. Amazon "will need to hire a lot of very smart people to successfully implement the automation projects it has planned," he told the E-Commerce Times. "Those high-skill, technical jobs aren't going to be replaced by automation." Further, Amazon is taking on Walmart, which "did over (US)$70 billion in U.S. net sales," Lippincott noted, and "the turf grab seems to make more sense in the near term than trying to squeeze out efficiencies." Making America Great Again Amazon is "summarizing the jobs program in advance of the inauguration," observed Ray Wang, CEO of Constellation Research. Its announcement shows that it is "aligning with the overall 'Make America Great Again' message on job creation," he told the E-Commerce Times. CEO Jeff Bezos is offering an olive branch to President-elect Donald Trump by getting behind his job creation agenda, Scherer suggested. The two had "butted heads over the role of The Washington Post during the election," he noted. Bezos owns the Post. Incoming president Donald Trump "is now a gift to Amazon," suggested Trip Chowdhry, managing director of equity research at Global Equities Research. Amazon's announcement, Tesla's pledge to build its gigafactories in the U.S., and Alibaba Group's promise to bring a million jobs to the U.S. "are very good signals that companies expanding and investing in their footprint will do well," he told the E-Commerce Times. Amazon's Future Path Amazon's moves "suggest it believes the American consumer market is still strong and will continue to be so," said Nucleus Research's Lippincott. Amazon's North America sales in Q3 totaled $18.87 billion, which was below the $19.09 billion analysts had expected, he noted, but it "might be going through some growing pains, where sales figures lag to catch up with the investments it has made. I don't think it is under threat in the e-commerce department." Amazon Web Services brought in revenues of $3.23 billion in Q3, beating Wall Street projections of $3.17 billion, and analysts expect AWS to account for a growing proportion of the company's earnings. AWS could deliver 43-50 percent revenue growth for the next three to five years, Global Equities Research projected last month. There are "a lot of potential areas where [Amazon] can expand," Lippincott suggested. "Its technology plays are some of the fastest-growing parts of the business." Jobs growth lies in the tech sector, Constellation Research's Wang pointed out, and with Amazon's investments in technology, it is "gaining on its rivals, which gives it a competitive advantage."

Here's why the warehouse retailer looks set to raise its dividend again in 2017. Jeremy Bowman (TMFHobo) Jan 13, 2017 at 1:06PM Image source: The Motley Fool.  Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) is not yet a Dividend Aristocrat, but in many ways the warehouse retailer has the hallmarks of one. With its membership-based business model, the company has an economic moat that has allowed it to consistently grow revenue and profits for the last 30 years to become one of the biggest retailers in the world today.  Though Costco pays a modest dividend yield at just 1.1%, it has been generous to shareholders offering large special dividend payouts twice in the last five years. Costco began paying a dividend in 2004 and has raised it every year since then, or 12 years in a row, from just $0.10 a quarter to now $0.45. The company has raised every year by at least 10%. What can investors expect for 2017?  Considering that Costco has raised its dividend every year for the last 12 years, it seems essentially guaranteed that it will hike it again this 2017. Costco generally raises its dividend in the spring so investors should expect the company to announce the dividend increase within the next two to three months. Last year, the company raised its quarterly distribution from $0.40 to $0.45, and I would expect a similar increase this year.  Though Costco's profit growth has slowed in recent years, the company's ratio is only about 33%, meaning it should be able to raise its dividend for at least a few years before it has to worry about it eating into its cash flow.  Analysts expect earnings per share to grow by about 11% this year, enough to justify hiking the dividend payout by the same amount. Looking further ahead, the retailer looks like it's in good shape to join peers like Wal-Mart and Target down the line as a Dividend Aristocrat, or a company that has raised its dividend payout every year for 25 years straight. While much of brick-and-mortar retail has been challenged, including Wal-Mart and Target, which have been forced to slow their dividend increases in recent years, Costco has proven more resilient. Its same-store sales continue to grow, though not as fast as they did before, and its member retention rate is near 90%, indicating that its customers are overwhelmingly satisfied with its service. Membership fees make up about two-thirds of Costco's operating profits so they are crucial to its business. Costco is also expected to raise its membership fee this year, which should pad its bottom line further. Though concerns have been growing about the threat Amazon.com and its Prime membership program pose to Costco, the warehouse retailer has looked solid thus far, despite Prime operating with a similar business model. With its buy-in-bulk service, it's difficult for almost anyone to compete with Costco's prices as it sells its products at the smallest of markups. However, as technologies like autonomous vehicles and drone delivery threaten to upend traditional retail, Costco could see its customers increasingly flee to e-commerce channels like Amazon. The long-term dividend outlook At a P/E near 30, Costco has a higher valuation than most of its peers. That valuation also keeps its dividend yield low as the payout is a function of its earnings. Over the next five to 10 years, Costco's valuation is likely to moderate as earnings growth slows, which should make the yield more appealing to dividend investors. As long as profits continue to grow, I'd expect Costco to keep up its strong pace of dividend increases. For investors looking for solid dividend growth stock, Costco is a good place to start.

Motley Fool Staff (the_motley_fool) Jan 13, 2017 at 11:41AM The best business development companies are performing spectacularly well, while the worst are down in the dumps. But don't expect activists to bail out the industry's laggards. With the median BDC trading at a mere 10% discount to book value, there just isn't enough profit potential to get activists excited about in 2017. In this segment of Industry Focus: Financials, join The Motley Fool's Gaby Lapera and Jordan Wathen as they discuss why activist investors will stay out of BDCs in 2017 and why rising interest rates may not be the boon that investors expect in the year ahead. A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on Jan. 9, 2017. Gaby Lapera: "There's more dispersion in performance." Jordan Wathen: I think that's absolutely true. If you look on a price-to-book-value basis, the lowest priced BDC sells for one-seventh of the highest priced BDC on a price-to-book basis. I don't think there's any other way to say that definitely happened. The BDCs that are performing really well have traded really well, and the BDCs that have credit issues this year have just done terribly. Lapera: Yeah. I looked at it, that means you get nine out of 12 correct, which is 75%. Cs are for degrees, so are Ds, but you know what? You definitely passed. Wathen: (laughs) Did I pass? And, the important thing to remember, I want to point this out, is that a lot of these predictions, if you nail one, you'll nail another. I said this before the show, but if you predict that it's going to be a very cold winter and the price of heating oil is going to go up, then you're probably going to get both of them right or both of them wrong. Balance it out. Lapera: Definitely. Do you have any predictions for next year? Er, this year? Wathen: Generally, first of all, activism, I think, is on hold. The median BDC trades at a 10% discount to book, so there's not really enough meat there, not enough room to make some money if you get in and mix things up. Secondly, this is really more of a warning, you really need to be very careful about this idea that rising rates will be generally good for BDCs, and you'll get all these dividend increases. I think what will happen, and what we'll see, is that over time, rising rates will lead to higher income, but it'll offset would-be dividend cuts, rather than lead to increasing dividends to investors.

Image URBANA — An Urbana man who burned an American flag in July and was arrested and detained by police for doing so said he undertook the protest to speak out against gun violence and violence "against members of my queer community and against every community considered to be 'other.'" Bryton Mellott explained his motives Thursday, a day after he filed a federal lawsuit against four members of the Urbana Police Department, who arrested him on Independence Day last year after he posted photos and comments on Facebook. Police arrested Mellott under Illinois' 1989 flag-desecration law, which makes publicly mutilating or defacing an American flag a Class 4 felony. But the U.S. Supreme Court determined that year that flag-burning was protected free speech, invalidating that law. The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Urbana on behalf of Mellott by attorneys from the American Civil Liberties Union and the Schiff Hardin law firm, asks to have the Illinois flag-desecration law declared unconstitutional, for a declaratory judgment that Mellott's constitutional rights were violated, for unspecified compensatory damages and for attorneys' fees and expenses. The Urbana Police Department said Thursday that it had no comment on the lawsuit. The defendants named are officers Kenneth Sprague, Jeremy Hale, Matthew McElhoe and Andrew Charles. Mellott, 22, said that his flag-burning and his July 3 post on Facebook were "calculated." In accompanying comments, he wrote, "I am not proud to be an American. In this moment, being proud of my country is to ignore the atrocities against people of color, people living in poverty, people who identify as women, and against my own queer community on a daily basis." He concluded: "I do not have pride in my country. I am overwhelmingly ashamed, and I will demonstrate my feelings accordingly. #ArrestMe." Although his Facebook comments did not include a mention of the shooting massacre at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Fla., where three weeks earlier 49 people were killed, Mellott said Thursday that it was on his mind at the time. "Specifically, that's what made me think about this post," Mellott said. "That was what inspired a lot of the text that I had included with the picture." At the time of Mellott's arrest, Urbana police said in a statement that they were concerned about the possibility of violence because of "the volume of responses and specificity of threat against his place of employment," the Savoy Wal-Mart. But Mellott said Thursday that at the time of his arrest, "there was no mention that my being taken into custody was protective, and frankly, had there been the option of protective custody, I would have considered it as a reasonable person who was put into danger." Rebecca Glenberg, an attorney for the ACLU, said that the Legislature and local police share the blame for Mellott's arrest, which the lawsuit claims was a violation of his constitutional rights. "There's plenty of blame to go around," she said. "Certainly, the Legislature has a responsibility to remove statutes from the books when it's clear that they are unconstitutional, and so, yes, they have some responsibility here. And so do local police departments when their officers are not aware of these developments in constitutional law and aren't sufficiently trained on fundamental constitutional principles." Ed Yohnka, a spokesman for the ACLU, said a 2013 review of the Illinois criminal code by the Legislature didn't include the flag-burning law and "was something they just missed, and they didn't take it off the books, or there might have been some fear that legislators wouldn't want to affirmatively vote to take this off the books." Steve Beckett, an Urbana attorney who has undertaken First Amendment cases but is not involved in Mellott's, said "the Legislature doesn't always remove from the books" those laws that have been found unconstitutional. "Somebody has to take responsibility to somehow annotate the statues, because if you're a police officer and you go to the book and that law is there, you're going to use it," he said. "There would be no reason for it to be off the books unless somebody repealed it. But then you stop and think about it, who's going to be the legislator who says, 'I'm against a law that criminalizes burning the flag?' Now you've got politics involved." Although Mellott was arrested at the Savoy Wal-Mart on the morning of July 4, he was released that afternoon after police consulted with the state's attorney's office. State's Attorney Julia Rietz opted not to charge him, citing the 1989 Supreme Court ruling. Glenberg said it is "a privilege to represent individuals who are fearless in speaking out and who are willing to come forward to defend their constitutional rights on behalf of all of us." She called the investigation into Mellott's flag-burning and his arrest "an unfortunate series of events. But the reason those events took place was because (A) we had an unconstitutional law still on the books, and (B) the police hadn't been adequately educated about the First Amendment and their obligations toward people who are exercising their right to free speech." Mellott said Thursday that he didn't want his acts to be viewed as a sign of disrespect toward the military. "I never really thought that it would come across that way," he said, explaining that his grandfather and two cousins have served. "I certainly didn't mean any ill will toward them. I have a great amount of respect for the military and people who serve."
