Eva Hicks posted the video, which was shot in a Centerton Walmart, on Monday night (May 22). Hicks said she asked the woman to move so she could reach something in the medical aisle. The video starts with the woman telling Hicks to "go back to Mexico." When Hicks defends her right to be in the store, the woman says a variety of statements saying that she is not welcome in America. When a third shopper steps up to defend Hicks, the woman responded by saying, "A n***** is calling me ignorant?" A Walmart manager overheard the interaction, and quickly stepped in. He reassured Hicks that she is welcome -- and wanted -- both in the store and in the country. The manager told the woman that her comments were inappropriate and that she needed to leave the store. Walmart released a statement saying they do not tolerate the woman's comments: "We value respect for everyone who visits our stores, whether they’re customers or associates. We have no tolerance for the language or actions of this customer and are proud to see that our manager responded appropriately by asking her to leave the store." Walmart said they will be reaching out to Hicks.

Rick Scott’s family history of alcohol abuse could decide ‘liquor wall” bill BY STEVE BOUSQUET Herald/Times Tallahassee Bureau LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story TALLAHASSEE Gov. Rick Scott must decide Wednesday whether to let Walmart and other big-box stores sell liquor, and he says a factor in his decision is the history of alcohol abuse in his family. Scott has the last word on one of the session’s most heavily-lobbied issues — one that divided powerful special interests. The bill on his desk would repeal a decades-old law that prohibits groceries from selling vodka, gin and other spirits, even though they can sell beer and wine. It’s rare for Scott to offer clues as to how he will act on a bill. But he told reporters Tuesday that this issue has personal significance. “I’ve had family members who have dealt with the challenge of alcoholism,” Scott said. “It concerns me, and so as I review the bill, I take all those issues into consideration.” Scott has a brother in Texas who has coped with alcohol and drug abuse. The governor’s late mother, Esther, said in his first campaign in 2010 that Scott’s birth father was an abusive alcoholic who abandoned the family when Scott was an infant. The bill (SB 106), sponsored by Republican Sen. Anitere Flores of Miami, passed the Senate, 21-17, and in a moment of high drama, it squeaked through the House on a vote of 58 to 57. One House member switched his vote from yes to no right after the electronic roll call vote. Had he done so sooner the bill would have died, but by then, it was too late. Now Scott must sign or veto the bill. He also could allow it to become law without his signature, but a governor rarely uses that option on such a controversial and high-profile issue. Walmart would be one of the biggest beneficiaries of the bill, but supporters say other chains that would also sell liquor include Target, Costco, Whole Foods, Sam’s Club and Walgreens. Scott scheduled separate phone calls Tuesday with a key bill supporter, Walmart USA’s chief executive Greg Foran, and an opponent, Charles Bailes III, chief executive of the Florida-based ABC Fine Wine & Spirits chain. Scott’s office had received more than 3,000 emails and phone calls on the issue through Tuesday, with opponents leading supporters by nearly a 7-1 margin. “I do not believe that Florida needs to increase access to alcohol by allowing spirits to be sold on grocery store shelves,” Dr. Gary Cox, pastor of Grace Presbyterian Church in Madison in North Florida, wrote to Scott. “Consumers are not asking for this legislation. Large corporations are.” Taking the other side, Audrey Jackson of Melbourne wrote: “As a consumer, I want to buy spirits and groceries in the same place. We all want a convenient shopping experience.” Supporters of tearing down the so-called “liquor wall” have emphasized Scott’s own core philosophy of Florida being a welcoming state for business by reducing burdensome regulations on businesses. Opponents argue that removing the liquor wall would eliminate jobs by hurting local chain liquor stores and would make it easier for minors to illegally buy alcohol or steal it. Spearheading the opposition is Publix, a powerful force in state politics for decades. The grocery giant has spent millions building free-standing liquor stores near, but separate, from its food stores. The bill would phase in the repeal over four years to give the grocery giant time to end leases on some liquor stores. Supporters counter that local liquor stores such as the ABC chain offer door-to-door delivery of liquor in many Florida cities. According to the Florida House website, 125 lobbyists registered to lobby for or against the bill this session, representing Walt Disney World, breweries, restaurants, hotels, chain liquor stores and major big-box retailers. As Scott ponders whether to sign or veto the bill, he has powerful friends and enemies on opposite sides. A Scott ally, Senate Appropriations Chairman Jack Latvala, R-Clearwater, favors keeping the wall in place. House Speaker Richard Corcoran, R-Land O’Lakes, who was Scott’s biggest nemesis all session long on funding tourism and jobs programs, supports repeal of the wall and voted for it. The issue was not a legislative priority for him, but the speaker’s brother, Michael, has been a lobbyist for Walmart for a number of years in Tallahassee.

(Photo: Robert F. Bukaty / AP) 1 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE New York — A proposal to curtail the nation’s food stamp program would pinch families struggling to pay for groceries and ripple through other areas of the economy, including supermarkets and discounters, as people shuffle their budgets. President Donald Trump is proposing a roughly 30 percent reduction in the federal budget for the program formally known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. His overall budget proposal met a chilly reception from lawmakers, and is unlikely to be passed as is. But it suggests increasing work requirements for SNAP recipients, and says states should both share in the cost of the program and determine the level of benefits they provide. That would lead to fewer people in the program, or could reduce how much help they get. Last year, more than 44 million people received an average of about $125 a month in SNAP benefits, totaling about $66.6 billion, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. How any cuts would play out across industries would depend on how people adjust to pay for food, how reliant a retailer is on SNAP spending and other factors. Here’s a look at what we know. WHO USES SNAP, AND WHERE ARE THEY SHOPPING? SNAP households are already on extremely tight budgets. To qualify, a family of four’s take-home pay can be no more than $2,025 a month, while a two-person household can earn no more than $1,335. More than 260,000 locations were authorized to accept SNAP credits last year. Superstores such as Wal-Mart and Target got 52 percent of redemptions, supermarkets like Kroger got 30 percent, and convenience stores got about 6 percent, according to the USDA . The rest was split among other kinds of stores. The USDA doesn’t specify how much is spent at specific retailers. But in 2013, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. told the Wall Street Journal that it gets about 18 percent of total SNAP benefits. That would have been about $13.43 billion in 2012. WHAT HAPPENED WITH PREVIOUS SNAP CUTS? It’s complicated. Since food is a fixed cost, retailers have said that people used money intended for other purposes to pay for groceries after a recent pullback in the program. “They’re paying cash or on a credit card if they didn’t have the food stamps. And then they will give up on something else,” Kroger’s CEO at the time, Dave Dillon, said in December 2013. That was after the SNAP benefits that were expanded during the recession returned to their previous levels. But how companies are affected can vary and it’s difficult to pinpoint the impact of any one change on sales, which can be affected by weather, competitive pressure and other factors. After the 2013 rollback in benefits, Wal-Mart blamed a 0.4 percent quarterly sales decline on the reduction, though the sales figure was down for the company’s entire fiscal year. Last year, the SNAP program also underwent cuts when 22 states reinstated a three-month limit on benefits for unemployed adults who aren’t disabled or raising children and don’t meet certain work requirements. That limitation had been waived by some states during the recession. Dollar General, which has said it gets about 5 percent of its sales from SNAP benefits, compared the impact of the reduction last year to what happened in 2013. “Our traffic slowed tremendously then, very similar to as it did now,” Dollar General CEO Todd Vasos said last summer. WHAT CHANGES FOR RETAILERS? Trump’s proposal suggests that retailers pay a fee for authorization to accept food stamps. Companies currently don’t pay to participate, which the proposal says fails to recognize “the significant portion of a retailer’s revenue that SNAP can represent.” The proposed budget estimates the fees would raise about $2.4 billion over 10 years. It doesn’t spell out how the fee would be calculated. Imposing a fee could result in smaller stores or chains deciding not to seek authorization, said Craig Gundersen, a professor of agricultural economics at the University of Illinois who has received grants from the agency that administers the food stamp program. That would reduce the number of places where people who use SNAP could get groceries. The National Grocers Association said the fee proposal “raised a red flag.” It otherwise declined to comment on how its members might be affected by the proposed changes, but said the SNAP program plays “an important role in providing a safety net to those in need.” HOW DO SNAP CUTS AFFECT THE LARGER ECONOMY? The government’s overall SNAP spending declines when the economy improves and fewer people rely on the program. It’s a situation that is the “best possible outcome,” said Stacy Dean, vice president of food assistance policy at the liberal-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Dean said cutting benefits when people’s financial situations are not improving could mean they use money they otherwise would have spent on needs like clothing or even medicine to make up for the gaps in their food budget. So there’s still an impact to the overall economy, she said. Putting off other purchases could affect other departments at superstores or separate retailers. A report by the USDA in 2010 also said that boosting SNAP benefits during economic downturns starts a “multiplier process” in transactions and consumption. It found that boosting SNAP expenditures by $1 billion was estimated to increase economic activity by $1.79 billion. Trump’s proposal could have more significant effects than the rollbacks in 2013 and last year, said Gundersen. He said shifting costs partially to states would be unprecedented and likely lead to cutbacks. That’s because states may decide they can’t afford to fund benefits during tough economic times, or cut benefits for other reasons. Maine Gov. Paul LePage has asked to ban the purchase of candy and soda with food stamps. LePage has expressed optimism that his push could gain traction under Trump’s administration. 1 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The woman, who has not been publicly identified, was apparently shopping at the Bentonville, Arkansas, Walmart on Monday when the racist incident took place and was caught on video. Her target was initially another shopper, who happened to be Hispanic. However, as the viral video demonstrated, she quickly got vulgar and abusive with an African-American customer and a store manager who tried to defuse the situation. The video of the racist encounter was shared to Facebook on Monday evening, and in it, the woman who Walmart now plans to ban can be heard telling Eva Hicks, a mom of three, to “go back to Mexico.” When an unidentified African-American woman refers to her behavior as “ignorant,” the soon-to-be banned shopper can be seen and heard on video responding, “a n***er’s calling me ignorant?” According to Hicks, the entire altercation began when she politely said “excuse me” and asked the woman to move so that she could reach some medicine on the shelf behind her. After video of the racist Walmart incident went viral, the retail chain responded by saying that their manager did the right thing by asking the irate woman to leave the store. However, as CNN reports, hundreds of people took to social media to say that they believed the woman deserved a harsher punishment for her racist Walmart tirade. Walmart took to social media to assure those angry about Eva Hicks’ treatment, including Shaun King (who demanded that she be banned for life), that the behavior of the woman in the viral video “cannot be tolerated.” Through @WalmartNewsroom, a Walmart spokesperson also vowed that the retail giant was “continuing to look into the matter.” @ShaunKing @Walmart @ShaunKing, we agree that this cannot be tolerated and are continuing to look into the matter. Below is our official statement: pic.twitter.com/BkKKVDrjE6 — Walmart Newsroom (@WalmartNewsroom) May 23, 2017 On Wednesday afternoon, media outlets began to report that they will be asking the unidentified woman to no longer shop at any of its stores as a result of her racist attack caught on tape. According to Eva Hicks, the primary victim of the woman’s allegedly unprovoked verbal abuse, the woman became aggressive as soon as Hicks politely asked her to move. As the woman’s torrent of hate continued in the Walmart medicine aisle, Hicks decided to take out her phone and start recording the unbelievable incident. “She moved back her cart and immediately started saying that people bother her on every aisle, and started saying more hateful things to me. I am an American citizen, I consider this home. I am not going to leave, I am going to stay here, I am not going to shut up, I am going to speak up.” Walmart shopper tells woman to 'go back to Mexico' in incredibly racist rant.https://t.co/5mahfb7Qtu pic.twitter.com/kJOqutgaDA — someecards (@someecards) May 23, 2017 In the video, the woman can be heard telling Hicks to “go back to Mexico,” that “we” don’t want her here, and that the United States is not her country. Hicks says that while she was born in Mexico City, she has lived in the U.S. for over three decades and is a U.S. citizen. What’s more, she says that in more than 30 years, she has never been subjected to the kind of racist treatment she endured while shopping at Walmart on Monday. @DailyMail It's Trump Land.

She will be banned for life from entering any WM store. — Nan (@NanInKansas) May 24, 2017 Hicks says that she posted the disturbing video to her Facebook page in an effort to raise awareness of this kind of racist behavior. She claims that she has seen an increase in people reporting this kind of public racism over the last few months, and she believes that she knows why the unidentified woman felt empowered and emboldened to unleash a racist tirade in the middle of an Arkansas Walmart — namely, a new presidential administration. “I have seen a lot of these incidents lately, I believe ever since the Trump administration came into power, he can say hateful things to other races and other countries, these people think it’s okay for them to do the same.” Racist woman launches tirades against Mexican and black shoppers https://t.co/O9195e0oiE — Daily Mail US (@DailyMail) May 23, 2017 A spokesperson for Walmart claims that the woman in the racist viral video has yet to be identified, but that Walmart is working to figure out who she is. The spokesperson added, “once identified we will ask she no longer shops at our stores.” What do you think about the way this incident was handled? Did Walmart make the right decision by choosing to ban the woman behind the racist verbal assault, or is a lifetime ban too extreme? Let us know in the comments section below.

Eva Hicks posted the video, which was shot in a Centerton Walmart, on Monday night (May 22). Hicks said she asked the woman to move so she could reach something in the medical aisle. The video starts with the woman telling Hicks to "go back to Mexico." When Hicks defends her right to be in the store, the woman says a variety of statements saying that she is not welcome in America. When a third shopper steps up to defend Hicks, the woman responded by saying, "A n***** is calling me ignorant?" A Walmart manager overheard the interaction, and quickly stepped in. He reassured Hicks that she is welcome -- and wanted -- both in the store and in the country. The manager told the woman that her comments were inappropriate and that she needed to leave the store. Walmart released a statement saying they do not tolerate the woman's comments: "We value respect for everyone who visits our stores, whether they’re customers or associates. We have no tolerance for the language or actions of this customer and are proud to see that our manager responded appropriately by asking her to leave the store." Walmart said they will be reaching out to Hicks.

(Image Source: Twitter Video screenshot) 111 Follow Share Tweet A viral video showing a white woman using racist epithets against a Hispanic woman and a black woman at a Walmart will result in a lifetime ban from the retail store giant. The incident happened at the Bentonville, Arkansas Walmart. The video begins in the middle of the altercation as the Hispanic woman says that she was just saying, “excuse me,” when the woman tells her “go back to Mexico.” Another shopper intervenes, and the white woman tells her, “A n****r’s calling me ignorant?” After that she tells the Hispanic woman, “We don’t want you here.” The video was posted by the Hispanic woman on her Facebook page, and garnered over 18 million views. “I never in my life thought this would happen to me. Yes me. Just on a simple trip to the grocery store after a hard day of work. I love this country and I will stay in this country. Friends please share,” she wrote. A store manager asked the white woman to leave while allowing the Hispanic woman to stay shopping. Initially, Walmart released a statement simply decrying the altercation. “We value and respect everyone who visits our stores,” the statement read. “We have no tolerance for the language or actions of this customer and are proud that our assistant manager responded appropriately by asking her to leave the store.” But since then Walmart has also told NBC news that they will ban the woman who hurled the racist slurs for life as soon as they identify her. They are also attempting to contact the Hispanic woman and the African-American woman to apologize for what happened at their store.

After a few minutes, a manager arrived and asked the woman to leave the store Walmart said it was still working to identify the woman in the video, but said once it did, it would 'ask she no longer shops at our stores' By Jessica Chia and Liam Quinn For Dailymail.com Published: 19:42 EDT, 24 May 2017 | Updated: 21:05 EDT, 24 May 2017 e-mail 90 shares View comments Walmart said they would ban a female shopper who was caught on camera going on a tirade against black and Hispanic shoppers in Arkansas on Monday. A spokesperson for the retail chain told CNN they were still working to identify the woman who accosted Eva Hicks and called another shopper a 'n*****'. Hicks, a Mexican American who has been living in the US for more than 30 years, said she politely asked the white woman to step aside so she could grab her medicine in the pharmacy aisle. But the white woman did not take to her request kindly, and instead told her to 'go back to Mexico' before adding: 'It's not your country...we don't want you here.' Scroll down for video  A woman shopping at a Walmart in Centerton, Arkansas, has been filmed going on a racist rant on Monday. Walmart said it will ban her from the store once they identify her Eva Hicks (left and right) was a victim of the abuse after she stopped in at a Walmart on the way home from work on Monday Walmart also responded to activist Shuan King and said it had 'no tolerance for the language and actions of this customer' Walmart issued a statement saying it had 'no tolerance for the language and actions of this customer', adding that they were proud the Centerton store's assistant manager stepped in and asked her to leave. A spokesperson told CNN they were still looking to identify the woman and said 'once identified we will ask she no longer shops at our stores'.  Hicks started filming the woman with her mobile phone and shared the shocking footage to Facebook, writing: 'I never in my life thought this would happen to me. Yes me.  'Just on a simple trip to the grocery store after a hard day of work. I love this country and I will stay in this country.' In the three-minute clip, Hicks can be heard saying, 'Listen, I said excuse me, don't be rude.' But the woman responded: 'Go back, wherever you're from. You're the one that's rude. 'You're in America, you are in America.' A third woman, who is off-screen, is then heard saying: 'Are you serious right now?'

Share this article Share 90 shares The racist woman was seen in the video abusing Hicks (left). She also waved her arm at her (right) - seemingly in an attempt to shoo her away The angry white shopper quickly switches her attention to the black woman off-camera, saying: 'That's none of your business right now, stay out of it.' The third woman replies: 'I don't need to stay out of it. You are yelling loud enough for everyone to hear, stop being ignorant.' That remark prompts the elderly woman to fire off an incredibly offensive attack. 'A n*****'s calling me ignorant?' Hicks, who is clearly shocked by the comment towards the third woman, is heard saying: 'Oh my goodness, you are very rude.' The racist woman then waves her arm in the direction of Hicks, adding: 'Just go away, just get your stuff and get out of here. Then go back to Mexico.' The woman continued in her rant for about three minutes. She repeatedly told Hicks to leave the country and 'go back where she came from' 'No, I will not get out of here, no,' Hicks replies. 'No I'm not, because this is my country, yes it is.' The elderly woman again cuts her off, saying: 'It's not your country, oh no, we don't want you here.' At that point, a store manager can be heard off camera saying: 'That's not true, we want you here.' The manager then begins speaking to the white woman, telling her: 'This is inappropriate.' Thinking she had a defender, the woman pointed at Hicks and said for the manager to 'tell her'. 'No ma'am, it's inappropriate speak for the store,' he replied. Confused, the racist woman is then heard saying: 'I'm not here for the store, I'm spending money in the store.' When a manger arrived the woman tried to point the finger at Hicks (left). However, the employee, asked the woman to leave the store instead Hicks, who sounds in the video as though she is holding back tears, then said, 'so am I', before the white woman turned to her again and tried to wave her away while rudely saying: 'please go, go.' Mocking Hicks for being emotional about the situation, the woman then said, 'wah, wah, wah,' and pretending to cry. The black woman who was abused earlier in the clip is then heard asking the manager, identified only as Wes, if the woman 'still had a right to be in the store'. Wes said no, and then asked the racist woman to leave the store. 'It's not my fault… you going to make her leave too?' she asked. 'Well, you're the one causing a scene in the store… I heard you, I heard you from the office,' Wes said. 'I'm just trying to resolve a conflict here.' The racist woman then shot back: 'No you're not, the conflict is her.' But a few seconds later, the woman surrenders and stormed out of the store. Hicks said she was planning to meet the woman who tried to step in and defend her, saying she hoped to give her a hug.   Read more: Walmart to ban woman who told customer to 'go back to Mexico,' called another the N-word - CNN.com Share or comment on this article e-mail 90 shares Most watched News videos Homeless man describes how he helped after Manchester attack EXCLUSIVE: Ariana Grande's plane arrives back in the US Pope Francis blesses FLOTUS Melania Trump's rosary beads Eye witness describes spotting the Manchester attacker Moment 'nail bomb' explodes at Ariana Grande concert Man is arrested by police outside Buckingham Palace Huge tailbacks on M6 as police after crash between lorry and car Forensic officers raid 'home of Manchester suicide bomber' Blood seen dripping from victim's leg after Manchester 'explosion' Martyn Hett appears in series one of Couples Come Dine with me Sickening 'ISIS' video warns of more attacks after Manchester Man arrested in Wigan in connection with Manchester attack Was bomber's family in global terror network?

June 16 will be the last day of business for the grocery store at 2972 Iris Ave. (Matthew Jonas / Staff Photographer) Walmart, we hardly knew ye. The mega-retailer on Tuesday announced plans to close its Boulder outpost, a Neighborhood Market concept, less than four years after opening. June 16 will be the last day of business for the grocery store at 2972 Iris Ave. Company spokesperson Anne Hatfield said the decision was motivated by the changing nature of retail, including the shift to online shopping. "We're evolving as a company to make sure we're keeping up with those changes," she said. "Our customers want to shop when and how they want (and) we need to make sure we're providing that right blend of e-commerce offerings and physical stores." Officer C. Parker, with the Boulder Police Department, left, informs Cliff Smedley, center, and Michelle McAlpin, as well as other protesters, of Walmart's private property boundaries during a protest in 2013 in front of the Walmart on 28th and Iris street in Boulder. (Jeremy Papasso / Staff Photographer) Hatfield said axing the Boulder store was an "isolated event" — no other closures are planned at this time. The Neighborhood Market concept, launched in 1998, is going strong, she said, with more than 600 locations around the country. About 70 employees in Boulder will be given the option to transfer to a nearby store. There is a Walmart Supercenter in Lafayette, two in Broomfield and two in Longmont. The 53,500-square-foot Neighborhood Market opened in October 2013 to protests from Boulder residents. Rumors abounded in the community for more than a year before Walmart announced its intentions; permits filed for the space, formerly home to Ross and PetSmart, did not identify the operator. Advertisement Details in the filings, such as paint colors, floor plan and cart corrals, matched the company's motif and fueled speculation and debate in the community about the world's largest corporation — often maligned for its business practices — setting up shop in a liberal enclave. Hatfield said Walmart does not have plans for a continued presence in Boulder but remains committed to Colorado. There are 100 Walmart and Sam's Clubs in the state, including one at Longmont's Village at the Peaks. The company remodeled 17 Colorado stores last year and plans to spruce up five more in 2017. This is the second national grocery store to close a Boulder location this year. Austin, Texas-based Whole Foods shuttered its Baseline operation in February, part of an effort to shed smaller, older stores. Local grocer Alfalfa's saw a boost in sales from the Whole Foods closure, said company spokesperson Sonja Tuitele. The two stores, a mere two miles apart, catered to the same group of nearby organic shoppers. Tuitele is confident that Alfalfa's will continue to thrive in Boulder and wasn't surprised that Walmart hadn't in the hyper-competitive market that includes two Lucky's Markets, two Whole Foods, two Sprouts, three Safeways, two King Soopers, and a Natural Grocers and Trader Joe's. "Unless you differentiate yourself, it's easy to get lost in the fray." The overabundance of shopping options is no comfort to Karen Swett, who works out at the 24-Hour Fitness next door and shops at the Walmart for its convenience and low prices. "I know people are down on shopping at Walmart," she said, "but it's expensive enough to live in Boulder," and savings on groceries at the Neighborhood Market helped alleviate that pressure, if just a little bit. "I'm bummed it's closing."

The recording, taken by someone else shopping at the Wal-Mart Neighborhood Market in Centerton, shows a woman becoming verbally aggressive with a fellow patron. At one point while arguing with the customer in a medicine aisle, the woman can be seen and heard telling her to “go back to Mexico.” “You’re in America. You’re in America,” the woman repeats to the customer at the store in Northwest Arkansas. "I'm not going to get out of here ... because this is my country," the patron replies. "It's not your country. We don't want you here," the woman rebuts. When another customer approaches to intervene and tells the woman to “stop being ignorant,” she is then told by the woman to "stay out of it." “A n*’s calling me ignorant?” the woman is seen on camera saying to the customer, who is just outside the frame. An assistant manager at the Wal-Mart is later heard asking the woman to leave, calling her behavior inappropriate. The cellphone video has made rounds on social media since it was first posted Monday, and later published to national media outlets such as CNN, Fortune and the New York Daily News. It had garnered more than 17 million views on Facebook as of Wednesday evening. Wal-Mart spokesman Charles Crowson said the company will take any steps it can to identify the woman and bar her from entering its stores. “We have no tolerance for the language or actions of this customer and are proud that our assistant manager responded appropriately by asking her to leave the store,” the retailer said in a statement. As of Wednesday evening, the company had not sought assistance from local authorities to help identify the woman. Tweet ADVERTISEMENT More Latest News Restaurant Transitions: Taco Bueno coming to ...

A proposal to curtail the nation’s food stamp program would pinch families struggling to pay for groceries and ripple through other areas of the economy, including supermarkets and discounters. (Robert F. Bukaty, File/Associated Press) By Candice Choi | AP By Candice Choi | AP May 24 at 6:45 PM NEW YORK — A proposal to curtail the nation’s food stamp program would pinch families struggling to pay for groceries and ripple through other areas of the economy, including supermarkets and discounters, as people shuffle their budgets. President Donald Trump is proposing a roughly 30 percent reduction in the federal budget for the program formally known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. His overall budget proposal met a chilly reception from lawmakers, and is unlikely to be passed as is. But it suggests increasing work requirements for SNAP recipients, and says states should both share in the cost of the program and determine the level of benefits they provide. That would lead to fewer people in the program, or could reduce how much help they get. Last year, more than 44 million people received an average of about $125 a month in SNAP benefits, totaling about $66.6 billion, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. How any cuts would play out across industries would depend on how people adjust to pay for food, how reliant a retailer is on SNAP spending and other factors. Here’s a look at what we know. WHO USES SNAP, AND WHERE ARE THEY SHOPPING? SNAP households are already on extremely tight budgets. To qualify, a family of four’s take-home pay can be no more than $2,025 a month, while a two-person household can earn no more than $1,335. More than 260,000 locations were authorized to accept SNAP credits last year. Superstores such as Wal-Mart and Target got 52 percent of redemptions, supermarkets like Kroger got 30 percent, and convenience stores got about 6 percent, according to the USDA . The rest was split among other kinds of stores. The USDA doesn’t specify how much is spent at specific retailers. But in 2013, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. told the Wall Street Journal that it gets about 18 percent of total SNAP benefits. That would have been about $13.43 billion in 2012. WHAT HAPPENED WITH PREVIOUS SNAP CUTS? It’s complicated. Since food is a fixed cost, retailers have said that people used money intended for other purposes to pay for groceries after a recent pullback in the program. “They’re paying cash or on a credit card if they didn’t have the food stamps. And then they will give up on something else,” Kroger’s CEO at the time, Dave Dillon, said in December 2013. That was after the SNAP benefits that were expanded during the recession returned to their previous levels. But how companies are affected can vary and it’s difficult to pinpoint the impact of any one change on sales, which can be affected by weather, competitive pressure and other factors. After the 2013 rollback in benefits, Wal-Mart blamed a 0.4 percent quarterly sales decline on the reduction, though the sales figure was down for the company’s entire fiscal year. Last year, the SNAP program also underwent cuts when 22 states reinstated a three-month limit on benefits for unemployed adults who aren’t disabled or raising children and don’t meet certain work requirements. That limitation had been waived by some states during the recession. Dollar General, which has said it gets about 5 percent of its sales from SNAP benefits, compared the impact of the reduction last year to what happened in 2013. “Our traffic slowed tremendously then, very similar to as it did now,” Dollar General CEO Todd Vasos said last summer. WHAT CHANGES FOR RETAILERS? Trump’s proposal suggests that retailers pay a fee for authorization to accept food stamps. Companies currently don’t pay to participate, which the proposal says fails to recognize “the significant portion of a retailer’s revenue that SNAP can represent.” The proposed budget estimates the fees would raise about $2.4 billion over 10 years. It doesn’t spell out how the fee would be calculated. Imposing a fee could result in smaller stores or chains deciding not to seek authorization, said Craig Gundersen, a professor of agricultural economics at the University of Illinois who has received financial support from the Walmart Foundation and grants from the agency that administers the food stamp program. That would reduce the number of places where people who use SNAP could get groceries. The National Grocers Association said the fee proposal “raised a red flag.” It otherwise declined to comment on how its members might be affected by the proposed changes, but said the SNAP program plays “an important role in providing a safety net to those in need.” HOW DO SNAP CUTS AFFECT THE LARGER ECONOMY? The government’s overall SNAP spending declines when the economy improves and fewer people rely on the program. It’s a situation that is the “best possible outcome,” said Stacy Dean, vice president of food assistance policy at the liberal-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Dean said cutting benefits when people’s financial situations are not improving could mean they use money they otherwise would have spent on needs like clothing or even medicine to make up for the gaps in their food budget. So there’s still an impact to the overall economy, she said. Putting off other purchases could affect other departments at superstores or separate retailers. A report by the USDA in 2010 also said that boosting SNAP benefits during economic downturns starts a “multiplier process” in transactions and consumption. It found that boosting SNAP expenditures by $1 billion was estimated to increase economic activity by $1.79 billion. Trump’s proposal could have more significant effects than the rollbacks in 2013 and last year, said Gundersen. He said shifting costs partially to states would be unprecedented and likely lead to cutbacks. That’s because states may decide they can’t afford to fund benefits during tough economic times, or cut benefits for other reasons. Maine Gov. Paul LePage has asked to ban the purchase of candy and soda with food stamps. LePage has expressed optimism that his push could gain traction under Trump’s administration. ___ Follow Candice Choi at www.twitter.com/candicechoi Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

MUST WATCH Racist rant inside Walmart goes viral 01:17 Story highlights Woman in Arkansas tells customer to 'go back to Mexico' Calls another woman the n-word Walmart says it will ask the woman to shop elsewhere New York (CNN)Walmart says it will ask a customer to no longer shop at their stores after she was caught on video hurling racial abuse at other customers in Bentonville, Arkansas, on Monday. Video posted to Facebook on Monday night that shows a woman telling one customer to "go back to Mexico" and calling another customer a racial epithet has been shared hundreds of thousands of times on the social network. Eva Hicks, a mother of three, said she politely asked the woman to step to one side as she reached for medicine. It was then the woman became aggressive, Hicks told CNN. "She moved back her cart and immediately started saying that people bother her on every aisle, and started saying more hateful things to me," Hicks recounted and then took out her phone and began to record the encounter. The woman, who has not been identified, told Hicks to "go back to Mexico" and accused her of being rude. Read More Another woman off-camera intervenes and tells the woman to stop being "ignorant." The woman on camera responds, "a n***er's calling me ignorant?" "I have never experienced anything like that in my life," Hicks said. "Nobody has ever talked to me like that, I felt very insulted and unwanted." @ShaunKing @Walmart @ShaunKing, we agree that this cannot be tolerated and are continuing to look into the matter. Below is our official statement: pic.twitter.com/BkKKVDrjE6— Walmart Newsroom (@WalmartNewsroom) May 23, 2017 Hicks, originally from Mexico City, says she has been living in the United States for more than 30 years. In the video she tells the woman that this is her home. "It's not your country, we don't want you here," the woman retorted. "I am an American citizen, I consider this home. I am not going to leave, I am going to stay here, I am not going to shut up, I am going to speak up," Hicks said Wednesday, adding that she posted the video to Facebook to raise awareness. "I have seen a lot of these incidents lately, I believe ever since the Trump administration came into power, he can say hateful things to other races and other countries, these people think it's okay for them to do the same." In a statement posted online Walmart said it had "no tolerance for the language or actions" of the customer and commended the staff member seen in the video, saying he acted appropriately by asking the woman to leave. A Walmart spokesperson told CNN on Wednesday that they were working to identify the woman and "once identified we will ask she no longer shops at our stores." Hicks said she hopes to meet the woman who came to her defense and was subsequently called the N-word. "I don't know her, I am supposed to meet her today," she said. "I want to meet her to say thank you and just give her a hug." Content by LendingTree Mortgage rates just plummeted. Lock in now!

By RexNutting Columnist Dominant U.S. companies have delivered amazing benefits to consumers and shareholders, but their success has also damaged our economy. The problem with winner-take-all capitalism is that the winners take it all and leave a mess for the rest of us to deal with. These companies have developed fantastic brands and wonderful products and services, but the downside to the proliferation of superstar companies is equally real: They are destroying local economies, driving down workers’ wages, shackling growth, depressing entrepreneurship and increasing the inequality that’s ripping our country apart. And for all the talk about disruptive technologies, it’s getting worse. Census Bureau statistics show that about three-fourths of U.S. business sectors have become more concentrated in the past 20 years, as indicated by an ever-growing market share for the top companies in hundreds of sectors, from dog food to health insurance. About 10% of the economy is deemed to be highly concentrated, with almost all of the revenue in those niches going to just a few companies. Many industries are effectively controlled by fewer than 10 companies. And it’s not obscure backwaters of the economy. These are goods and services we buy every day. Think of big-box retailers, airlines, express-delivery companies, drug makers, car makers, insurers, banks, media companies, phone companies, software companies, electronics makers, aerospace firms, vast swathes of the internet and even slaughterhouses. Think of companies like Alphabet GOOG, +0.65% Apple AAPL, -0.30% Facebook FB, +1.33% Microsoft MSFT, +0.13% General Motors GM, -0.06% AT&T T, -0.42% UPS UPS, +0.50% Altria MO, +1.00% Wal-Mart WMT, -0.43%  and American Express AXP, -0.10% and dozens more. The largest highly concentrated businesses Segment Market share of top four companies Annual revenue in segment (2012) Warehouse clubs & supercenters 93.6% $406 billion Drug wholesalers 72.1% $319 billion Auto & truck manufacturing 68.6% $231 billion Drug stores 69.5% $230 billion Mobile-phone service 89.4% $225 billion Airlines 65.3% $157 billion Administration of pension funds 76.3% $145 billion Landline-phone service 73.4% $142 billion Cable TV 71.1% $138 billion Airplane manufacturing 80.1% $113 billion As of the 2012 Economic Census The list includes almost all of the biggest companies in America. Almost all of the gains in the stock market come from these few corporations. And they earn almost all of the profits. In many cases, the dominant companies have licenses, patents, copyrights or other intellectual property that lock out potential competitors. They have powerful brands that command a premium. They take advantage of network effects, which create natural monopolies. They lobby governments for subsidies or special regulatory favors. To snuff out competition, they acquire potential rivals or lock up supplies of essential inputs, including skilled labor. They control distribution channels. Must read: Anheuser-Busch InBev shuts out craft beer brewers by hoarding hops In some cases, those few companies act more like a cartel than they do competitors. Their size gives them economies of scale that smaller rivals can’t match. In other words, these companies are protected by high barriers to entry, what famed investor Warren Buffett calls a “moat.” A moat protects the company, keeping profits higher than they would be if it faced real, fair competition. “So what’s the problem?” you may say. After all, these companies are winners, they’re giving the people what they want — stop punishing success. For decades, economists, jurists and policy makers thought the same thing. As long as consumers weren’t harmed, they ignored the increasing concentration of American and global industries, figuring that there wasn’t much to worry about. But lately, there’s been a lot more attention paid to the downside of the monopolization of America. Here are the three biggest problems with our winner-take-all economy. Wages are lower; profits are higher The most damning charge is that the trend toward larger companies is driving a wedge between the few at the top who are paid spectacularly well and the majority at the bottom whose wages are stagnant. Economists David Autor, David Dorn, Lawrence Katz, Christina Patterson and John Van Reenen concluded in a recent paper that the rise of “superstar” firms with high profits and relatively small workforces has contributed to the shrinkage in workers’ share of national income and a corresponding increase in the share of profits. Economists Jason Furman and Alan Krueger argue that some firms are able to tamp down wages through what’s called monopsonistic behavior, such as collusion and noncompete agreements. (A monopsony is a company that exercises power as the only buyer, analogous to a monopolist who is the only seller.) Collusion to depress wages is prevalent in high-tech, entertainment and health care. Jason Furman & Peter Orszag The median corporation gets a return on invested capital of about 20%, but the top 10% of companies hit 100%, a sign that they are extracting economic rents due to their market power. Furman and Peter Orszag, meanwhile, found that a small number of companies use their market power to capture extraordinary 100% returns on invested capital, compared with typical profits of 20% or so. Also read: Monopsony — the one word that explains why your pay is so low Local economies are hollowed out Once upon a time, back in the economy’s golden age, every city had a local department store or two, as well as other businesses with deep roots in the community, such as banks, newspapers, TV stations, factories, drug stores, utilities and others. The owners and the top managers of those businesses lived in the community, and felt a sense of civic pride that went beyond noblesse oblige. They were the paternalistic philanthropists who funded the arts, the parks, the libraries, the schools and the hospitals. The money generated by those businesses stayed local, keeping the regional economy chugging along. But now the owners and top managers have moved on, replaced by the faceless, faraway investors that George Packer described in “The Unwinding.” The new bosses have no place for sentimentality, as Christopher Lasch observed in his prophetic “The Revolt of the Elites and the Betrayal of Democracy” more than 20 years ago. They care about their bottom line, their summer house and their private school; they don’t care about Youngstown. Locally owned businesses are better for communities, many researchers have found. They hire more local workers, they buy from local suppliers, and the revenue they receive is recycled locally, rather than in the Hamptons or Shanghai. The presence of lots of local businesses even seems to lower the crime rate. Local businesses appear to be a public good, something state and local economic development agencies should consider the next time they try to lure a big multinational corporation. Business dynamism suffers The potential profits and wealth earned by a winner-take-all company ought to provide a great incentive for entrepreneurs to start new businesses with the hope of becoming a dominant firm themselves, but the trend is going the wrong way: For all the talk about disruptive companies, there are fewer startups now than there were decades ago, in part because the barriers to entry into these lucrative markets are so high that few entrepreneurs even try. Source: Census Bureau The number of new companies formed each year is down sharply. Many of the new tech startups never get the chance to compete with the established companies, because as soon as they prove their technology, they are acquired. The big five tech firms — Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft — have acquired more than 500 companies in the past decade. The most profitable companies in America aren’t reinvesting much in their businesses. For them, it’s more profitable to restrict production and dampen supply than it is to invest in expanding their capacity. If would-be rivals can’t mount an effective attack on their moat, the entrenched companies have a reduced incentive to research and develop the next big thing. Innovation suffers, and that means the economy isn’t growing as fast as it could. Conclusion The economy is indeed rigged against the majority in favor of a few. It’s not just a few banks that are “too big to fail.” It’s not just a few heavily regulated industries, or the new frontiers of high-tech. Most of the highly successful businesses are privileged. Many critics of our stagnant economy say the problem is globalization, and their answer is to control the borders. But the problems of business concentration would be just as debilitating if the United States were a completely closed economy. The global nature of these businesses isn’t the core problem; concentration is. The winner-take-all economy is making losers out of American workers and communities. We desperately need more competition. Our economy needs to be constantly renewed through the process of creative destruction, but that’s not happening.

How food stamp cuts could ripple through the economy World by Candice Choi, The Associated Press Posted May 24, 2017 12:21 pm MDT Last Updated May 24, 2017 at 5:20 pm MDT FILE - In this Friday, March 17, 2017, file photo, a sign advertises a program that allows food stamp recipients to use their EBT cards to shop at a farmer's market in Topsham, Maine. A proposal to curtail the nation's food stamp program would pinch families struggling to pay for groceries and ripple through other areas of the economy, including supermarkets and discounters. (AP Photo/Robert F. Bukaty, File) NEW YORK, N.Y. – A proposal to curtail the nation’s food stamp program would pinch families struggling to pay for groceries and ripple through other areas of the economy, including supermarkets and discounters, as people shuffle their budgets. President Donald Trump is proposing a roughly 30 per cent reduction in the federal budget for the program formally known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. His overall budget proposal met a chilly reception from lawmakers, and is unlikely to be passed as is. But it suggests increasing work requirements for SNAP recipients, and says states should both share in the cost of the program and determine the level of benefits they provide. That would lead to fewer people in the program, or could reduce how much help they get. Last year, more than 44 million people received an average of about $125 a month in SNAP benefits, totalling about $66.6 billion, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. How any cuts would play out across industries would depend on how people adjust to pay for food, how reliant a retailer is on SNAP spending and other factors. Here’s a look at what we know. WHO USES SNAP, AND WHERE ARE THEY SHOPPING? SNAP households are already on extremely tight budgets. To qualify, a family of four’s take-home pay can be no more than $2,025 a month, while a two-person household can earn no more than $1,335. More than 260,000 locations were authorized to accept SNAP credits last year. Superstores such as Wal-Mart and Target got 52 per cent of redemptions, supermarkets like Kroger got 30 per cent, and convenience stores got about 6 per cent, according to the USDA . The rest was split among other kinds of stores. The USDA doesn’t specify how much is spent at specific retailers. But in 2013, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. told the Wall Street Journal that it gets about 18 per cent of total SNAP benefits. That would have been about $13.43 billion in 2012. WHAT HAPPENED WITH PREVIOUS SNAP CUTS? It’s complicated. Since food is a fixed cost, retailers have said that people used money intended for other purposes to pay for groceries after a recent pullback in the program. “They’re paying cash or on a credit card if they didn’t have the food stamps. And then they will give up on something else,” Kroger’s CEO at the time, Dave Dillon, said in December 2013. That was after the SNAP benefits that were expanded during the recession returned to their previous levels. But how companies are affected can vary and it’s difficult to pinpoint the impact of any one change on sales, which can be affected by weather, competitive pressure and other factors. After the 2013 rollback in benefits, Wal-Mart blamed a 0.4 per cent quarterly sales decline on the reduction, though the sales figure was down for the company’s entire fiscal year. Last year, the SNAP program also underwent cuts when 22 states reinstated a three-month limit on benefits for unemployed adults who aren’t disabled or raising children and don’t meet certain work requirements. That limitation had been waived by some states during the recession. Dollar General, which has said it gets about 5 per cent of its sales from SNAP benefits, compared the impact of the reduction last year to what happened in 2013. “Our traffic slowed tremendously then, very similar to as it did now,” Dollar General CEO Todd Vasos said last summer. WHAT CHANGES FOR RETAILERS? Trump’s proposal suggests that retailers pay a fee for authorization to accept food stamps. Companies currently don’t pay to participate, which the proposal says fails to recognize “the significant portion of a retailer’s revenue that SNAP can represent.” The proposed budget estimates the fees would raise about $2.4 billion over 10 years. It doesn’t spell out how the fee would be calculated. Imposing a fee could result in smaller stores or chains deciding not to seek authorization, said Craig Gundersen, a professor of agricultural economics at the University of Illinois who has received financial support from the Walmart Foundation and grants from the agency that administers the food stamp program. That would reduce the number of places where people who use SNAP could get groceries. The National Grocers Association said the fee proposal “raised a red flag.” It otherwise declined to comment on how its members might be affected by the proposed changes, but said the SNAP program plays “an important role in providing a safety net to those in need.” HOW DO SNAP CUTS AFFECT THE LARGER ECONOMY? The government’s overall SNAP spending declines when the economy improves and fewer people rely on the program. It’s a situation that is the “best possible outcome,” said Stacy Dean, vice-president of food assistance policy at the liberal-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Dean said cutting benefits when people’s financial situations are not improving could mean they use money they otherwise would have spent on needs like clothing or even medicine to make up for the gaps in their food budget. So there’s still an impact to the overall economy, she said. Putting off other purchases could affect other departments at superstores or separate retailers. A report by the USDA in 2010 also said that boosting SNAP benefits during economic downturns starts a “multiplier process” in transactions and consumption. It found that boosting SNAP expenditures by $1 billion was estimated to increase economic activity by $1.79 billion. Trump’s proposal could have more significant effects than the rollbacks in 2013 and last year, said Gundersen. He said shifting costs partially to states would be unprecedented and likely lead to cutbacks. That’s because states may decide they can’t afford to fund benefits during tough economic times, or cut benefits for other reasons. Maine Gov. Paul LePage has asked to ban the purchase of candy and soda with food stamps. LePage has expressed optimism that his push could gain traction under Trump’s administration. ___ Follow Candice Choi at www.twitter.com/candicechoi Movie Trailers May 19, 2017 to May 25, 2017 Landmark 6, 10015 Manning Ave. PH:791-6610 Landmark Cinemas Landmark Cinemas Fort McMurray Weekend Listings: The Boss Baby (G) 11:45am / 3:00pm / 6:30pm / 9:30pm Smurfs: The Lost Village (PG) 12:00pm / 3:15pm / 6:15pm / 9:00pm The Fate and the Furious (PG) 11:30am / 12:30pm / 2:45pm / 3:45pm / 6:00pm / 7:00pm / 9:15pm / 10:15pm Going in Style (PG) 12:45pm / 4:00pm / 7:15pm / 9:45pm Beauty and the Beast (PG) 12:15pm / 3:30pm / 6:45pm / 10:00pm          660 NEWS CALGARY NATIONAL The Wednesday news briefing: An at-a-glance survey of some top stories May 24, 2017, 4:51 PM Most actively traded companies on the TSX May 24, 2017, 4:37 PM Premier seeks answers on sudden Labrador flooding: ‘No doubt people are fearful’ May 24, 2017, 4:35 PM Endangered salamanders put quarry on hold as residents fight against project May 24, 2017, 4:34 PM Throwing chaos aside, Trump aims for caution on big trip May 24, 2017, 4:15 PM After breaking even, NY City Opera stays with reduced season May 24, 2017, 4:00 PM B.C.

Imports and exports are vital components of every day life for retail giant Wal-Mart Stores, which is why the retailer monitors trade legislation and political ideologies which could disrupt the product supply chain. Lisa Schimmelpfenning, vice president of direct imports administration at Wal-Mart Stores, recently spoke about the retailer’s efforts to build up import program over the past two decades. Schimmelpfenning was one of the speakers at the recent Arkansas Trucking Association annual business conference in Rogers. Wal-Mart imports far more than it exports, and she said the retailer wholeheartedly supports free trade. The retailer noted in its recent 10-K filing that changes in trade policies, including tariffs and government regulations between the U.S,. and other countries where it sources many of the products it sells, could create considerable risks to the company. She said the proposed border adjustment tax doesn’t look imminent, but if approved would increase the cost for importing goods for all companies. She said there is a consolidated effort by many business sectors to defeat a border tax because it would hurt many companies with operations outside the U.S. “What would the border adjustment tax do to the price of a sweater? Many think it would raise the cost of goods imported by 20%,” she said. Wal-Mart noted in its filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission: “A significant portion of the general merchandise we sell in our U.S. stores and clubs is manufactured in other countries. Any such actions could increase the cost to us of such merchandise (whether imported directly or indirectly) and cause increases in the prices at which we sell such merchandise to our customers, which could materially adversely affect the financial performance of our U.S. operations and our business.” Wal-Mart declined to disclose the value of its imports and exports each year. However the Journal of Commerce reports Wal-Mart has been the single largest U.S. importer of consumer goods since 2012. Often the volume of the retailer’s imports surpasses the trade volume of entire countries. In 2015, Wal-Mart imported 795,900 TEUs – or shipping containers – full of product from abroad. The retailer’s import volume grew 10.5% since 2012, according to the Journal of Commerce report. Schimmelpfenning admitted the retailer is criticized for its massive imports but she noted that the retailer also exports products. She said the retailer’s growing e-commerce business is helping to raise exports for things like health and beauty aids and vitamins to China, where there is a natural distrust of the Chinese market. In 2014, Wal-Mart also said it exported $45 million of pears, apples and cherries all from Washington state. The products were sold at its retail stores in Canada, Great Britain, Mexico, China and India. Wal-Mart opened a sourcing office in Yakima in 2009 to help it source fruit for its U.S operations and abroad. “By using the strength of our supply chain, we’re able to source from 60 countries to send the right products at the right price to customers, not just in the U.S., but to every market where we operate stores,” Wal-Mart noted in a April 2014 blog post on is website. Ragan Dickens, corporate spokeswoman at Wal-Mart, said according to data from suppliers, “items that are made here, sourced here or grown here account for about two-thirds of what we spend to buy products at Walmart U.S.” Critics said the stat is skewed given that Wal-Mart is the nation’s largest grocer and much of the U.S. product sourced is food. Since 2012, Wal-Mart has also pledged to buy an additional $250 billion of product made in the U.S. in an effort to support U.S. manufacturing jobs. Some of that product includes bicycles, televisions, pacifiers and bath towels. But there is still much imported from abroad. TRADE COMPLICATIONS Schimmelpfenning said trade has become more complicated in the post 9-11 world. She said Wal-Mart began in the 1980s developing a broader relationship with Customs and Border Protection, a division of Homeland Security. “We have invested board and executive time to be present at meetings to help educate customs officials about the supply chain processes. Post 9-11 customs officials who used to look for drugs are now trying to spot threats of terrorism,” she said. “Most agencies are doing more with less and if we can help government figure out how to best assess the risks it will help us in this important business as well. Part of that is relevant to the supply (chain) and how it does and doesn’t happen.” Schimmelpfenning said the first months of the Trump administration have included much rhetoric on trade. For instance, the back and forth on NAFTA – the North American Free Trade Agreement – and the U.S. threat to pull out. “One day we are pulling out and two days later we are back in for now,” she said. She said much of television manufacturing has moved into northern Mexico and that’s an industry that would be hurt if the U.S. were to pull completely out of NAFTA. She also said the unraveling of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) was a blow for Wal-Mart given that the retailer had spent an entire year in Vietnam working to create public/private partnerships to facilitate trade and educate suppliers who could help the retailers do business with Vietnam. “He [Trump] shut that down,” she said. She said China is the “elephant in the room” with a whopping trade imbalance facilitated in part by the country’s currency manipulation. The U.S. imports about $450 billion of goods from China each year with just $116 billion of U.S. products shipped to China, creating a huge trade deficit. She said Wal-Mart would like to help drive more exports to China given the burgeoning middle class there. However, she said the puzzle is in figuring out how to boost exports to China given the anti-dumping duties and currency manipulation that make it difficult to export to China. “We need remedies to equalize the cost of products which would mean more goods are sold abroad,” she added. “The hope is we will have some pragmatic changes to bring trade back to the middle.” Comments comments Previous post Vehicle fuel economy, number of miles driven expected to rise Next post U.S. bank income up 12.7% in first quarter, number of ‘problem banks’ continues to fall Talk Business & Politics by email Arkansas headlines delivered to you on demand Email address Statewide Newsletter Northeast Arkansas Newsletter Fort Smith Newsletter Northwest Arkansas Newsletter Submit Advertisement Search Talk Business & Politics Search for: Opinion Tamika Edwards Ending poverty one judgment at a time Stacey Mason 15 skills to build Michael Tilley Riff Raff: Camel backs and last straws Robert Coon In defense of Goldilocks Todd Turner Deceptive Trade Practices Act changes will harm Arkansas consumers Latest Popular New Sam’s Club set to open in Springdale, third club in Northwest Arkansas 6 hours ago Ending poverty one judgment at a time 7 hours ago Wal-Mart executive, Gov.

President Donald Trump is proposing a roughly 30 percent reduction in the federal budget for the program formally known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. His overall budget proposal met a chilly reception from lawmakers, and is unlikely to be passed as is. But it suggests increasing work requirements for SNAP recipients, and says states should both share in the cost of the program and determine the level of benefits they provide. That would lead to fewer people in the program, or could reduce how much help they get. Last year, more than 44 million people received an average of about $125 a month in SNAP benefits, totaling about $66.6 billion, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. How any cuts would play out across industries would depend on how people adjust to pay for food, how reliant a retailer is on SNAP spending and other factors. Here's a look at what we know. WHO USES SNAP, AND WHERE ARE THEY SHOPPING? SNAP households are already on extremely tight budgets. To qualify, a family of four's take-home pay can be no more than $2,025 a month, while a two-person household can earn no more than $1,335. More than 260,000 locations were authorized to accept SNAP credits last year. Superstores such as Wal-Mart and Target got 52 percent of redemptions, supermarkets like Kroger got 30 percent, and convenience stores got about 6 percent, according to the USDA . The rest was split among other kinds of stores. The USDA doesn't specify how much is spent at specific retailers. But in 2013, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. told the Wall Street Journal that it gets about 18 percent of total SNAP benefits. That would have been about $13.43 billion in 2012. WHAT HAPPENED WITH PREVIOUS SNAP CUTS? It's complicated. Since food is a fixed cost, retailers have said that people used money intended for other purposes to pay for groceries after a recent pullback in the program. "They're paying cash or on a credit card if they didn't have the food stamps. And then they will give up on something else," Kroger's CEO at the time, Dave Dillon, said in December 2013. That was after the SNAP benefits that were expanded during the recession returned to their previous levels. But how companies are affected can vary and it's difficult to pinpoint the impact of any one change on sales, which can be affected by weather, competitive pressure and other factors. After the 2013 rollback in benefits, Wal-Mart blamed a 0.4 percent quarterly sales decline on the reduction, though the sales figure was down for the company's entire fiscal year. Last year, the SNAP program also underwent cuts when 22 states reinstated a three-month limit on benefits for unemployed adults who aren't disabled or raising children and don't meet certain work requirements. That limitation had been waived by some states during the recession. Dollar General, which has said it gets about 5 percent of its sales from SNAP benefits, compared the impact of the reduction last year to what happened in 2013. "Our traffic slowed tremendously then, very similar to as it did now," Dollar General CEO Todd Vasos said last summer. WHAT CHANGES FOR RETAILERS? Trump's proposal suggests that retailers pay a fee for authorization to accept food stamps. Companies currently don't pay to participate, which the proposal says fails to recognize "the significant portion of a retailer's revenue that SNAP can represent." The proposed budget estimates the fees would raise about $2.4 billion over 10 years. It doesn't spell out how the fee would be calculated. Imposing a fee could result in smaller stores or chains deciding not to seek authorization, said Craig Gundersen, a professor of agricultural economics at the University of Illinois who has received grants from the agency that administers the food stamp program. That would reduce the number of places where people who use SNAP could get groceries. The National Grocers Association said the fee proposal "raised a red flag." It otherwise declined to comment on how its members might be affected by the proposed changes, but said the SNAP program plays "an important role in providing a safety net to those in need." HOW DO SNAP CUTS AFFECT THE LARGER ECONOMY? The government's overall SNAP spending declines when the economy improves and fewer people rely on the program. It's a situation that is the "best possible outcome," said Stacy Dean, vice president of food assistance policy at the liberal-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Dean said cutting benefits when people's financial situations are not improving could mean they use money they otherwise would have spent on needs like clothing or even medicine to make up for the gaps in their food budget. So there's still an impact to the overall economy, she said. Putting off other purchases could affect other departments at superstores or separate retailers. A report by the USDA in 2010 also said that boosting SNAP benefits during economic downturns starts a "multiplier process" in transactions and consumption. It found that boosting SNAP expenditures by $1 billion was estimated to increase economic activity by $1.79 billion. Trump's proposal could have more significant effects than the rollbacks in 2013 and last year, said Gundersen. He said shifting costs partially to states would be unprecedented and likely lead to cutbacks. That's because states may decide they can't afford to fund benefits during tough economic times, or cut benefits for other reasons. Maine Gov. Paul LePage has asked to ban the purchase of candy and soda with food stamps. LePage has expressed optimism that his push could gain traction under Trump's administration.

To the customer the word is synonymous with low prices, unlimited assortment, and fast and free shipping. To retailers it is a constant reminder that the retail landscape has been forever changed and they need to adopt to keep pace or be left on the outside looking in.  But can it also stand for opportunity? An opportunity for retailers to redefine and reimagine their organizations to compete in today’s customer-centric environment. Can it be a rallying call? A mantra of sorts for retailers to remind themselves that while the old way of doing business is gone, it should not be forgotten. And that by embracing their strengths and fortifying their weaknesses they can survive and thrive in the modern marketplace.  The Game Has Changed The meteoric rise of Amazon over the past 20 years from dotcom startup to e-commerce juggernaut has been well documented. Thanks to a dedication to a unique customer experience and a willingness to take big gambles and develop and implement disruptive technology, Amazon has solidified its position as the undisputed leader in the e-commerce space.  In fact, over the past 12 months Amazon has racked up more than $94 billion in online sales, which is nearly $40 billion more than the next nine retailers combined, according to data from eMarketer. While some retailers might be content to sit back and watch this river of cash flow in, Amazon knows the key to its success is remaining on the cutting-edge in both experience and technology.  “Amazon is fundamentally a technology company and retailers are routinely being asked to be technology companies,” says Lila Snyder, EVP and president, global e-commerce, Pitney Bowes. “But none of what retailers had to do before has gone away: merchandising, brand management, store ops, consumer experience, etc.” The key to Amazon’s market-leading position is its ability to deliver a differentiated customer experience that is built around on-trend assortment, value, and lightning-fast fulfillment. To provide these three critical differentiators Amazon invests in its machine learning and artificial intelligence capabilities to help it anticipate demand and power its merchandising and supply-chain solutions. Unfortunately for the rest of the industry, the e-commerce leader is light years ahead of the competition in these next-gen proficiencies. “The dirty secret in retail boardrooms is that retailers are still making decisions in spreadsheets and based on gut feel,” says former Amazon executive and Boomerang Commerce CEO Guru Hariharan. “If you contrast that with Amazon who is relentless about using technology and machine learning and setting it up for scale the situation is pretty stark.” Retailers are not starved for data — they are collecting it at every turn — but many have yet to figure out how to best turn that flood of data into valuable insight. And how to put that insight into action to power their decision making and operational efficiencies. Until they do many will be playing catchup with Amazon instead of charting their own course.   The Power of the Marketplace Amazon’s greatest weapon might well be its third-party seller marketplace. It allows the retailer to offer an endless-aisle experience without incurring the associated inventory costs. Not only does the marketplace increase Amazon’s assortment, it is a major source of income and a powerful resource that can be used to syphon market share from the competition.  For holiday 2016 Amazon shipped 50% more items for its third-party vendors through its Fulfillment by Amazon service — and more than two billion throughout 2016. It has been reported that nearly half of its revenue has been generated through the marketplace, making the service not only a competitive advantage but a financial windfall. “2016 was a record-breaking year in sales worldwide for sellers on Amazon,” says Peter Faricy, VP, Amazon Marketplace. “Sellers are choosing Amazon because we help them build and grow their businesses.”   With so much money up for grabs it is no wonder that traditional retailers like Best Buy, Sears and Walmart have gotten in on the act, opening up their own third-party sales channels. Walmart, who has been making strides in its ongoing battle with Amazon for e-commerce supremacy, paid over $3 billion to acquire Jet.com last year primarily to expand the reach and power of its marketplace. “We look at marketplaces as the new retail battle ground,” says Jenn Markey, VP marketing, 360pi. “Traditional retailers really need to figure out how to leverage the marketplace concept. And how to use them for competitive information. You can learn an awful lot on what products are trending by looking at what is listed on marketplaces. This is a relatively untapped area for competitive intelligence that most retailers would be wise to look into.”  In addition to the massive amounts of revenue and business intelligence Amazon collects through its marketplace there is another key advantage of the service: margin protection. Like most retailers, Amazon makes its greatest margin on new and exciting products that are unique. As a category matures, however, competition increases, prices are adjusted and margin reduces. When this price adjustment occurs Amazon begins to transfer many of those products to marketplace sellers, unloading lesser margin items and focusing its direct sales on higher profit SKUs. “We have studied this and as a category matures Amazon begins to transfer more and more of those things to the marketplace,” Markey says. “For example, Amazon carries approximately 64 million products in the home and kitchen category. That number stays relatively static. But over the past year marketplace sellers have increased their offerings by 54% in the category while Amazon itself decreased its assortment by 24%.”  If You Can’t Beat Them, Join Them The runaway success of Amazon’s marketplace has not gone unnoticed by the competition ― especially when their products are offered by Amazon’s third-party sellers at price points lower than their own.  The Art of Shaving is a specialty retailer that sells male shaving and grooming products. Its assortment is tailored to its clientele and its high-end shaving supplies were supposed to be unique to the brand, but they began to be offered by third-party sellers on Amazon’s marketplace. Rather than compete with Amazon and lose vital sales revenue in the process, The Art of Shaving decided to partner with the e-commerce giant instead.  “You almost have to go to Amazon,” says Ralph Niebles, VP, IT, The Art of Shaving. “If our product is up there and it is competing against us we might as well just own it ourselves. When you find your product on Amazon sometimes it is deeply discounted. By partnering with Amazon we are able to control pricing and eliminate the third-party competition.”  While retailers like The Art of Shaving are joining forces with Amazon to protect their product line, others are building unique assortments specifically for the marketplace. Carter’s designed its Simple Joy line to be sold exclusively on Amazon. It’s the retailer’s first product line that was designed solely for the digital experience and the Amazon prime customer.  Although Carter’s is on a streak of 28 years of consecutive sales growth it has not been immune to the downturn many mall-based retailers have endured. The loss of foot traffic in stores has prompting the retailer to make a greater commitment to not only its own e-commerce offerings, but its partnership with Amazon.     “Our goal is to grow share and we think that being a partner with Amazon is an important thing for the company,” says Michael Casey, chairman and CEO, Carter’s. “We’ve modeled this new business after the successful launches of our exclusive brands developed for Target and Walmart. With this launch, we believe Carter’s has strengthened its position as the largest supplier of young children’s apparel.” Leverage Your Assets While partnering with Amazon is an effective strategy to bolster the bottom line and protect margin, competing with the online giant is still the goal. Traditional retailers have a vital asset at their disposal that can help level the playing field and allow them to meet shopper demand: their stores.  Amazon’s ability to quickly and affordably fulfill orders has forever changed the retail landscape, and left traditional retailers scrambling for ways to match the pure-play’s supply-chain prowess. By leveraging their physical footprint as mini distribution centers, omnichannel retailers can meet shopper demand closer to need and lessen the last mile of fulfillment.  “With Amazon you are competing on cost and speed,” says Snyder. “The best way to do both is to get the product closer to the consumer. Amazon has done it at scale with their fulfillment network and retailers can replicate it but it requires a different way of working. Order management, warehouse management, inventory visibility and store operations all have to be working together seamlessly. Many retailers are doing ship-from-store now, but not yet in an optimized way.”  Thirty-three percent of retailers currently have ship-from-store capabilities, with another 11% planning to offer the service in the next 12 months, according to RIS News’ “14th Annual Store Systems Study.” While ship-from-store can potentially level the playing field it requires an intricate coordination of previously disparate systems and a real-time, accurate view of inventory that many retailers have yet to master.  “In order to seamlessly fulfill from the store retailers need to be sure they have the product in stock and know where it is,” says Tom Bianculli, CTO, Zebra “Typically inventory accuracy at the store level is in the 60% to 70% range. Compare that to a warehouse where they have 99% inventory accuracy and the challenge is clear.”  While the average retailer does not yet have the item-level visibility required to fulfill from the store at scale, new advancements in inventory tracking thanks to RFID coupled with unified commerce systems is making near 100% inventory visibility within reach. Retailers are investing heavily in the space, with 46% naming inventory visibility a top store priority for 2017, according to the RIS News report.  “Three years ago the idea of fulfilling an e-commerce order from a store wasn’t really an option,” Bianculli says. “Disparate systems, lack of inventory accuracy and logistical issues made it impossible. Fast forward to today and we have gone from not plausible to happening. Some people skinned their knees trying to do it, but now it has become a core strategy of almost every brick-and-mortar retailer that we speak to. They are all talking about how to drive their inventory accuracy up to a level that allows them to consistently deliver from the store and meet shopper expectations.” In addition to ship-from-store, many retailers are also deploying buy-online, pickup in-store. The service allows retailers to meet shoppers need-it-now demands while eliminating the last-mile fulfillment costs that slice into profitability.  In April, Walmart launched a discount program on a select assortment of its online-only items that customers can purchase and receive preferential pricing if they pick the product up in-store. At launch around 10,000 SKUs were available for discounted in-store pick-up, but that number is expected to grow to more than a million products by the end of June.  “We’re creating price transparency to empower customers to shop smarter and choose what’s best for them,” says Marc Lore, president and CEO, Walmart U.S. By leveraging their fleet of trucks to ship product directly from fulfillment centers to its 4,700 stores Walmart can greatly reduce its shipping costs. “This means, quite simply, it costs less for us to ship to stores. So, our customers should share in those savings.” Building the Experience Amazon has conditioned customers to find what they need and quickly and easily have it delivered for free in as little as a day — or even hours in some markets. While deep-pocketed retailers are attempting to match Amazon’s fulfillment advantage, others are focusing on building a differentiated experience to carve out their piece of the market. In fact, 95% of retailers believe the in-store experience can differentiate their brand from online retailers, according to RIS/EKN’s “Third Annual Customer Engagement Study.”  It comes down to browse or buy. Those shoppers that know exactly what they are looking for will likely continue to make Amazon their retailer of choice. It is simply too easy to type in size 32x32 Dockers and place an order in a matter of seconds. However, if a customer is simply looking for a pair of pants, and doesn’t know the brand or style that will best fit their needs they are more likely to shop outside of Amazon.  To capture those browsing customers retailers need to ensure their assortment is tailored to their core shopper base and the store experience is seamless and inviting. As part of its Greatness Agenda — its stated goal to become the nation’s most engaging retailer — Kohl’s is tailoring its assortments to meet local demand while simultaneously reducing inventory levels.  Currently the retailer’s localization efforts are impacting about 85% of its assortment and is having a positive impact on sales. The tailored approach to its in-store inventory is designed to draw shoppers into the store to hopefully find and purchase items that are unique. Kohl’s localization efforts have the added benefit of lowering the retailer’s inventory commitment at the store level, which is key as the brand focuses on smaller footprint locations.  “The way they’re going to be smaller is to use technology to enable process inside the store more efficiently and fulfillment inside the store more efficiently,” says Kohl’s CEO Kevin Mansell. “And use our speed initiative and our sourcing strategies and our localization initiatives to be able to make better decisions on which brands and which categories are emphasized more in a smaller footprint. We’re really early here, last year was sort of the beginning, but this is a permanent long-term strategy for us to improve speed to market on our sourcing and technology to enable better utilization of our inventory across the whole portfolio.” Another key tactic to drive traffic into stores and away from online rivals is providing a differentiated in-store experience, an experience that cannot be replicated online. ULTA for example has a thriving in-store salon business that draws shoppers into the store and helped the cosmetics retailer grow in-store comps by 13.4% in 2016.  “We continue to evolve our marketing strategy by utilizing our CRM and loyalty programs to simplify offers to attract new guests to the salon, while still driving great value and great experience,” says ULTA CEO Mary Dillon.  Whether its tailored assortments, unique services, highly informed associates or unique and exciting digital enhancements, retailers need to up their in-store game to make their physical locations a destination.  Conclusion Amazon has clearly had an indelible impact on shoppers’ expectations. Consumers now expect fast, easy and convenient ways to shop and are making purchasing decisions based on retailers’ abilities to provide these critical capabilities.  To compete with the online goliath, omnichannel retailers must concentrate on what they do best and not fall into the trap of trying to outdo Amazon — a losing proposition if there ever was one. While fast, free shipping might be out of reach for many retailers, they can differentiate with an engaging experience, but unfortunately that will only take retailers so far. There is still a level of service retailers have to meet to survive today.   “Amazon has raised the bar on certain elements of customer service and you can’t be too far behind,” says Snyder. “Once the service level gap gets too wide between Amazon and the competition that is when customers will say I love the experience but it is not worth it.” While the word Amazon has become synonymous with easy shopping there is still plenty of opportunity for savvy retailers to position themselves as worthwhile experience-based options. By taking a few pages from Amazon’s playbook and leveraging their brick-and-mortar assets, omnichannel retailers can contend in the Amazon Age and help shape the future of retail.   SHARE YOU MAY ALSO LIKE Fulfillment Why Amazon Would Want CPG Companies To Go D2C E-Commerce Embracing the Shared Marketplace Economy: How Tech Vendors Are Changing the Face of Retail Digital Commerce Why Amazon Prime Day Matters: By the Numbers March 2017 Issue 5 Retailers That Matter Omnichannel Fulfillment by Amazon: A Deep Dive into Amazon’s Global Shipping Network RELATED TOPICS Digital Commerce MAY 2017 ISSUE Customer Experience Digital Tranformation Store Systems Supply Chain Management Store Operations Customer Analytics Customer Relationship Management (CRM) Customer Engagement Fulfillment E-Commerce Digital Commerce Footer Social LinkedIn Twitter Youtube Facebook Footer Contact Us Editorial Board Media Kit Privacy Statement Terms & Conditions © 2017 EnsembleIQ, All Rights Reserved

By RexNutting Columnist Dominant U.S. companies have delivered amazing benefits to consumers and shareholders, but their success has also damaged our economy. The problem with winner-take-all capitalism is that the winners take it all and leave a mess for the rest of us to deal with. These companies have developed fantastic brands and wonderful products and services, but the downside to the proliferation of superstar companies is equally real: They are destroying local economies, driving down workers’ wages, shackling growth, depressing entrepreneurship and increasing the inequality that’s ripping our country apart. And for all the talk about disruptive technologies, it’s getting worse. Census Bureau statistics show that about three-fourths of U.S. business sectors have become more concentrated in the past 20 years, as indicated by an ever-growing market share for the top companies in hundreds of sectors, from dog food to health insurance. About 10% of the economy is deemed to be highly concentrated, with almost all of the revenue in those niches going to just a few companies. Many industries are effectively controlled by fewer than 10 companies. And it’s not obscure backwaters of the economy. These are goods and services we buy every day. Think of big-box retailers, airlines, express-delivery companies, drug makers, car makers, insurers, banks, media companies, phone companies, software companies, electronics makers, aerospace firms, vast swathes of the internet and even slaughterhouses. Think of companies like Alphabet GOOG, +0.65% Apple AAPL, -0.30% Facebook FB, +1.33% Microsoft MSFT, +0.13% General Motors GM, -0.06% AT&T T, -0.42% UPS UPS, +0.50% Altria MO, +1.00% Wal-Mart WMT, -0.43%  and American Express AXP, -0.10% and dozens more. The largest highly concentrated businesses Segment Market share of top four companies Annual revenue in segment (2012) Warehouse clubs & supercenters 93.6% $406 billion Drug wholesalers 72.1% $319 billion Auto & truck manufacturing 68.6% $231 billion Drug stores 69.5% $230 billion Mobile-phone service 89.4% $225 billion Airlines 65.3% $157 billion Administration of pension funds 76.3% $145 billion Landline-phone service 73.4% $142 billion Cable TV 71.1% $138 billion Airplane manufacturing 80.1% $113 billion As of the 2012 Economic Census The list includes almost all of the biggest companies in America. Almost all of the gains in the stock market come from these few corporations. And they earn almost all of the profits. In many cases, the dominant companies have licenses, patents, copyrights or other intellectual property that lock out potential competitors. They have powerful brands that command a premium. They take advantage of network effects, which create natural monopolies. They lobby governments for subsidies or special regulatory favors. To snuff out competition, they acquire potential rivals or lock up supplies of essential inputs, including skilled labor. They control distribution channels. Must read: Anheuser-Busch InBev shuts out craft beer brewers by hoarding hops In some cases, those few companies act more like a cartel than they do competitors. Their size gives them economies of scale that smaller rivals can’t match. In other words, these companies are protected by high barriers to entry, what famed investor Warren Buffett calls a “moat.” A moat protects the company, keeping profits higher than they would be if it faced real, fair competition. “So what’s the problem?” you may say. After all, these companies are winners, they’re giving the people what they want — stop punishing success. For decades, economists, jurists and policy makers thought the same thing. As long as consumers weren’t harmed, they ignored the increasing concentration of American and global industries, figuring that there wasn’t much to worry about. But lately, there’s been a lot more attention paid to the downside of the monopolization of America. Here are the three biggest problems with our winner-take-all economy. Wages are lower; profits are higher The most damning charge is that the trend toward larger companies is driving a wedge between the few at the top who are paid spectacularly well and the majority at the bottom whose wages are stagnant. Economists David Autor, David Dorn, Lawrence Katz, Christina Patterson and John Van Reenen concluded in a recent paper that the rise of “superstar” firms with high profits and relatively small workforces has contributed to the shrinkage in workers’ share of national income and a corresponding increase in the share of profits. Economists Jason Furman and Alan Krueger argue that some firms are able to tamp down wages through what’s called monopsonistic behavior, such as collusion and noncompete agreements. (A monopsony is a company that exercises power as the only buyer, analogous to a monopolist who is the only seller.) Collusion to depress wages is prevalent in high-tech, entertainment and health care. Jason Furman & Peter Orszag The median corporation gets a return on invested capital of about 20%, but the top 10% of companies hit 100%, a sign that they are extracting economic rents due to their market power. Furman and Peter Orszag, meanwhile, found that a small number of companies use their market power to capture extraordinary 100% returns on invested capital, compared with typical profits of 20% or so. Also read: Monopsony — the one word that explains why your pay is so low Local economies are hollowed out Once upon a time, back in the economy’s golden age, every city had a local department store or two, as well as other businesses with deep roots in the community, such as banks, newspapers, TV stations, factories, drug stores, utilities and others. The owners and the top managers of those businesses lived in the community, and felt a sense of civic pride that went beyond noblesse oblige. They were the paternalistic philanthropists who funded the arts, the parks, the libraries, the schools and the hospitals. The money generated by those businesses stayed local, keeping the regional economy chugging along. But now the owners and top managers have moved on, replaced by the faceless, faraway investors that George Packer described in “The Unwinding.” The new bosses have no place for sentimentality, as Christopher Lasch observed in his prophetic “The Revolt of the Elites and the Betrayal of Democracy” more than 20 years ago. They care about their bottom line, their summer house and their private school; they don’t care about Youngstown. Locally owned businesses are better for communities, many researchers have found. They hire more local workers, they buy from local suppliers, and the revenue they receive is recycled locally, rather than in the Hamptons or Shanghai. The presence of lots of local businesses even seems to lower the crime rate. Local businesses appear to be a public good, something state and local economic development agencies should consider the next time they try to lure a big multinational corporation. Business dynamism suffers The potential profits and wealth earned by a winner-take-all company ought to provide a great incentive for entrepreneurs to start new businesses with the hope of becoming a dominant firm themselves, but the trend is going the wrong way: For all the talk about disruptive companies, there are fewer startups now than there were decades ago, in part because the barriers to entry into these lucrative markets are so high that few entrepreneurs even try. Source: Census Bureau The number of new companies formed each year is down sharply. Many of the new tech startups never get the chance to compete with the established companies, because as soon as they prove their technology, they are acquired. The big five tech firms — Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft — have acquired more than 500 companies in the past decade. The most profitable companies in America aren’t reinvesting much in their businesses. For them, it’s more profitable to restrict production and dampen supply than it is to invest in expanding their capacity. If would-be rivals can’t mount an effective attack on their moat, the entrenched companies have a reduced incentive to research and develop the next big thing. Innovation suffers, and that means the economy isn’t growing as fast as it could. Conclusion The economy is indeed rigged against the majority in favor of a few. It’s not just a few banks that are “too big to fail.” It’s not just a few heavily regulated industries, or the new frontiers of high-tech. Most of the highly successful businesses are privileged. Many critics of our stagnant economy say the problem is globalization, and their answer is to control the borders. But the problems of business concentration would be just as debilitating if the United States were a completely closed economy. The global nature of these businesses isn’t the core problem; concentration is. The winner-take-all economy is making losers out of American workers and communities. We desperately need more competition. Our economy needs to be constantly renewed through the process of creative destruction, but that’s not happening.

Total earnings from 90% of the sector’s total market capitalization reported so far are up 1.5% on 2.9% higher revenues with 63.6% of the companies beating on earnings and 54.5% exceeding top-line estimates, as per the latest Earnings Preview. Positive earnings reports from Wal-Mart WMT), Target (TGT – Free Report) and Home Depot (HD – Free Report) offset some negativity of weak results from department stores like Macy’s (M – Free Report) , Kohl’s (KSS – Free Report) , Nordstrom (JWN – Free Report) and J.C. Penney (JCP – Free Report) . However, growth rates and beat ratios are unimpressive, resulting in a 0.8% negative price performance for the sector (read: Retailers Slide: Will ETFs Bear the Pain as Q1 Unfolds?). Let’s dig into the details of the earnings releases: Earnings Sending Stocks Higher Big-box retailer, Target, emerged as the real champion in the Q1 earnings season as the stock surged as much as 4.5% following robust first-quarter fiscal 2017 results on May 17. The company topped our estimates by a huge 32 cents for earnings and by $377 million for revenues. It expects earnings per share in the range of $0.95–$1.15 for the ongoing quarter and $3.80–$4.20 for the year. The world’s largest retailer, Wal-Mart, jumped as much as 3.4% following robust first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on May 18 to hit a new 52-week high of $77.66. The company saw an increase of 1.4% in U.S. same store sales when other chain retailers are struggling. The mega retailer edged past our earnings estimates by four cents, while revenues fell short of our estimate by $84 million. Additionally, the company provided earnings per share guidance in the range of $1.00–$1.08 for the ongoing quarter. U.S. same-store sales are expected to grow 1.5–2%, higher than the analysts’ expectation of 1.2% (read: Wal-Mart Bucked the Weak Q1 Trend: ETFs to Buy). Home Depot, the world’s largest home improvement retailer, beat on first-quarter fiscal 2017 earnings by six cents and on revenues by $142 million. For fiscal 2017, Home Depot raised the earnings per share guidance to $7.15 from $7.13, which represents 11% increase year over year. The stock gained as much as 2.2% on the day of its earnings announcement on May 16. The Dampeners The second-largest department store retailer, Macy’s dampened the investors’ mood as its share price plunged 17% to its lowest since 2011 following fourth-quarter fiscal 2016 results. The retailer lagged our estimates for earnings by 11 cents and for revenues by $100 million. For fiscal 2017, it continues to project sales decline of 3.2–4.3% and earnings per share in the range of $2.90–$3.15. One of the leading department store retailers, J.C. Penney, tanked as much as 15.3% following the earnings announcement on May 12. Though the company topped our bottom-line estimate by 28 cents, it missed on revenues by $52 million. For fiscal 2017, the company continued to expect earnings per share in the range of 40–65 cents (see: all the Consumer Discretionary ETFs here). Specialty retailer, Nordstrom, dropped as much as 11.3% following first-quarter fiscal 2017 results. Though the company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings by a huge 16 cents, revenues fell short of our estimate by $81 million. The company reaffirmed its earnings per share guidance in the range of $2.75–$3.00 for fiscal 2017. One of the leading departmental stores Kohl’s also tumbled nearly 8% on the day after posting a bigger-than-expected drop in quarterly sales. Earnings per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 11 cents while revenues missed our estimate by $27 million.

In many cases, the dominant companies have licenses, patents, copyrights or other intellectual property that lock out potential competitors. They have powerful brands that command a premium. They take advantage of network effects, which create natural monopolies. They lobby governments for subsidies or special regulatory favors. To snuff out competition, they acquire potential rivals or lock up supplies of essential inputs, including skilled labor. They control distribution channels. Must read: Anheuser-Busch InBev shuts out craft beer brewers by hoarding hops In some cases, those few companies act more like a cartel than they do competitors. Their size gives them economies of scale that smaller rivals can’t match. In other words, these companies are protected by high barriers to entry, what famed investor Warren Buffett calls a “moat.” A moat protects the company, keeping profits higher than they would be if it faced real, fair competition. “So what’s the problem?” you may say. After all, these companies are winners, they’re giving the people what they want — stop punishing success. For decades, economists, jurists and policy makers thought the same thing. As long as consumers weren’t harmed, they ignored the increasing concentration of American and global industries, figuring that there wasn’t much to worry about. But lately, there’s been a lot more attention paid to the downside of the monopolization of America. Here are the three biggest problems with our winner-take-all economy. Wages are lower; profits are higher The most damning charge is that the trend toward larger companies is driving a wedge between the few at the top who are paid spectacularly well and the majority at the bottom whose wages are stagnant. Economists David Autor, David Dorn, Lawrence Katz, Christina Patterson and John Van Reenen concluded in a recent paper that the rise of “superstar” firms with high profits and relatively small workforces has contributed to the shrinkage in workers’ share of national income and a corresponding increase in the share of profits. Economists Jason Furman and Alan Krueger argue that some firms are able to tamp down wages through what’s called monopsonistic behavior, such as collusion and noncompete agreements. (A monopsony is a company that exercises power as the only buyer, analogous to a monopolist who is the only seller.) Collusion to depress wages is prevalent in high-tech, entertainment and health care. Jason Furman & Peter Orszag The median corporation gets a return on invested capital of about 20%, but the top 10% of companies hit 100%, a sign that they are extracting economic rents due to their market power. Furman and Peter Orszag, meanwhile, found that a small number of companies use their market power to capture extraordinary 100% returns on invested capital, compared with typical profits of 20% or so. Also read: Monopsony — the one word that explains why your pay is so low Local economies are hollowed out Once upon a time, back in the economy’s golden age, every city had a local department store or two, as well as other businesses with deep roots in the community, such as banks, newspapers, TV stations, factories, drug stores, utilities and others. The owners and the top managers of those businesses lived in the community, and felt a sense of civic pride that went beyond noblesse oblige. They were the paternalistic philanthropists who funded the arts, the parks, the libraries, the schools and the hospitals. The money generated by those businesses stayed local, keeping the regional economy chugging along. But now the owners and top managers have moved on, replaced by the faceless, faraway investors that George Packer described in “The Unwinding.” The new bosses have no place for sentimentality, as Christopher Lasch observed in his prophetic “The Revolt of the Elites and the Betrayal of Democracy” more than 20 years ago. They care about their bottom line, their summer house and their private school; they don’t care about Youngstown. Locally owned businesses are better for communities, many researchers have found. They hire more local workers, they buy from local suppliers, and the revenue they receive is recycled locally, rather than in the Hamptons or Shanghai. The presence of lots of local businesses even seems to lower the crime rate. Local businesses appear to be a public good, something state and local economic development agencies should consider the next time they try to lure a big multinational corporation. Business dynamism suffers The potential profits and wealth earned by a winner-take-all company ought to provide a great incentive for entrepreneurs to start new businesses with the hope of becoming a dominant firm themselves, but the trend is going the wrong way: For all the talk about disruptive companies, there are fewer startups now than there were decades ago, in part because the barriers to entry into these lucrative markets are so high that few entrepreneurs even try. Source: Census Bureau The number of new companies formed each year is down sharply. Many of the new tech startups never get the chance to compete with the established companies, because as soon as they prove their technology, they are acquired. The big five tech firms — Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft — have acquired more than 500 companies in the past decade. The most profitable companies in America aren’t reinvesting much in their businesses. For them, it’s more profitable to restrict production and dampen supply than it is to invest in expanding their capacity. If would-be rivals can’t mount an effective attack on their moat, the entrenched companies have a reduced incentive to research and develop the next big thing. Innovation suffers, and that means the economy isn’t growing as fast as it could. Conclusion The economy is indeed rigged against the majority in favor of a few. It’s not just a few banks that are “too big to fail.” It’s not just a few heavily regulated industries, or the new frontiers of high-tech. Most of the highly successful businesses are privileged. Many critics of our stagnant economy say the problem is globalization, and their answer is to control the borders. But the problems of business concentration would be just as debilitating if the United States were a completely closed economy. The global nature of these businesses isn’t the core problem; concentration is. The winner-take-all economy is making losers out of American workers and communities. We desperately need more competition. Our economy needs to be constantly renewed through the process of creative destruction, but that’s not happening.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include Target Corp. (NYSE: TGT – Free Report ), Tempur Sealy (NYSE: TPX – Free Report ), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN – Free Report ) and Walmart (NYSE: WMT – Free Report ). Today, Zacks is promoting its ”Buy” stock recommendations. Get #1Stock of the Day pick for free . Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog: Target Offers $1 Billion for Casper: Just the Start? Last week, big box giant Target Corp. (NYSE: TGT – Free Report ) reportedly offered $1 billion to acquire budding startup Casper Mattress , a company that designs, manufactures, and produces mattresses, bed frames, pillows, sheets, and even dog mattresses. The two companies were apparently in serious discussions over the last few months, but according to Recode , who cites multiple sources, neither could work out a deal. Instead, Target will plan on taking a minority stake in Casper, and will „likely be the lead investor in a large new round of funding for the startup that could be announced in the coming weeks,” said Recode. Launched officially in the summer of 2014, and named one of Fast Company ‚s most innovative companies in the world of 2017, Casper has a devoted fan base among millennials, especially those living in bustling metropolitan areas. The company has certainly taken the mattress industry by storm, slowly stealing away market share from giants like Mattress Firm and Tempur Sealy (NYSE: TPX – Free Report ). To try a Casper mattress out, the company offers a 100-day free trial; customers order the mattresses online, and they get shipped straight to their home folded up in a box. Casper is based in New York City, and while it used to have a showroom there, customers could only check out Casper products at West Elm stores. But now, Casper is coming to Target. „At Target, we strive to bring guests amazing new products and exciting partnerships, says Jill Sando, senior vice president, merchandising, home. „We love Casper’s brand and innovative products-and we really love the idea of giving our guests a simple way to get a better night’s sleep, with everything they need in one convenient place.” Target will begin selling Casper mattresses and bedding on its website and in 35 if its stores located near college campuses; Casper will be the only mattress brand for sale on Target.com when the partnership launches next month, notes Recode. And, Target will exclusively sell the Casper Lounger, a seat that can be folded up or laid out, and is perfect for relaxing or studying. Like many retailers in the age of Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN – Free Report ), Target has struggled with figuring out how to get shoppers in their stores. But while the company’s plight is not as hard as its peers, Target has certainly felt the effects of customers turning to the e-commerce behemoth for all their shopping needs. Rival Walmart (NYSE: WMT – Free Report ) has tried to counteract this consumer behavior with a unique digital shopping spree, notably buying up Jet.com for $3 billion in 2016, as well as Shoebuy, Moosejaw, and Modcloth; Walmart is also reportedly in talks to acquire men’s fashion retailer Bonobos. The strategy appears to be working : Walmart noted that its e-commerce business saw gross merchandise volume soar 69% in its latest quarterly earnings report. Is Target’s deal with Casper a sign it may start to acquire digital brands? While deal talks did eventually fall through, Target is no stranger to embracing digital-first brands. The company has partnered with grooming startups Bevel and Harry’s, as well as popular fashion blog Who What Wear in women’s clothing, in order to get young shoppers into its stores. Target is also making a serious commitment to introduce over a dozen exclusive brands over the next two years, as part of its plan to boost sales in its apparel and home departments; it found success with the launches of the Cat & Jack and Pillowfort brands. I’m not sure Target could begin acquiring smaller brands at the same pace Walmart is, but building relationships with digital companies like Casper is certainly a way to keep pace in a retail environment dominated by Amazon, especially if the relationships allow Target to operate in new sectors and industries and reach new customers.

Tech Apple Science Cars Samsung Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 Nintendo NES E3     Nintendo Switch Stock Updates For May 24 Posted: May 24 2017, 7:40am CDT | by Luigi Lugmayr, in News | Technology News     The latest Nintendo Switch stock tracking information for online and in store availability for Wednesday, May 24th. On May 24 GameStop offers one Nintendo Switch bundle online priced at $398.99. The Nintendo Switch with Neon Joy-Con  bundled with Mario Kart 8 Deluxe physical game and accessories ships within 24 hous from gamestop.com. Don't Miss: The hottest Apple Rumors for 2017 ToysRUs is selling a Nintendo Switch bundle including three games and accessories for $499.99 online. The GameStop and the ToysRUs bundle are the only way to buy a Nintendo Switch online today so far. To find Nintendo Switch in stock online, shoppers can use our new The Tracker app, available as free download for iOS and Android.  Nintendo believes the Nintendo Switch will be as big as the extremely successful Nintendo Wii. Looking at the current shortage, the Japanese video game maker has a long road ahead of them to ship 101 million Nintendo Switch consoles. The positive reception and praise of the Nintendo Switch fuel the demand for the mobile and home console hybrid. Nintendo is also busy marketing the Nintendo Switch with hands-on events and at the E3 2017. Find below the latest Nintendo Switch online availability updates and stock tracking updates for stores. Nintendo Switch Stock at Online Stores GameStop is offering one Nintendo Switch bundle for under $400. Yesterday the retailer still had two bundles available for under $400. The Zelda bundle sold out GameStop also runs a big video game accessories sale, including discounts of 20% on select Switch accessories. ToysRUs sells a $499.99 Nintendo Switch bundle online on toysrus.com. Amazon restocked the Nintendo Switch on Wednesday last week. Only Prime members got access to the Nintendo Switch stock. When the next Switch sale on Amazon takes place is not known. Use our new Tracker app to get notified when the Switch is in stock at Amazon. Last Friday at 5:01pm ET, Walmart is sold again the Nintendo Switch online at walmart.com. This was the 7th time Walmart sold the Nintendo Switch on Fridays.  The Switch will be available as a custom bundle. Through the Walmart app the $299 Switch consoles have been available too. To get an notification when Walmart is again selling the Nintendo Switch online next week try our new Tracker app. The Switch is extremely hard to score on Friday at walmart.com. A lot of successful orders got cancelled afterwards as Walmart sold more than they had available. It is a head-scratcher why Walmart's shopping platform is not able to keep sales and stock in sync. At this point no online retailer is selling the $299.99 Nintendo Switch consoles. The Nintendo Switch will continue to be hard to find for the foreseeable future. Nintendo plans to ship 10 million consoles world-wide in the time from April 2017 to April 2018. From the launch on Mach 3 to April 27, the Mario company sold 2.74 million Switch consoles. Online stores restocked the $299.99 Nintendo Switch with Gray Joy-Con and the $299.99 Nintendo Switch with Neon Joy-Con in time for the launch of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe on April 28. Since then the Switch console was out of stock online, besides the TRU bundle offer, according to data from The Tracker. The Nintendo Switch reseller markups keep steady and range today between $93 to $110 for the Nintendo Switch with Gray Joy-Con and $100 to $130 for the Nintendo Switch with Neon Joy-Con on amazon.com. The Nintendo Switch with Neon Joy-Con is more rare than the console with Gray controllers, resulting in considerable higher market value. Overall the Nintendo Switch market prices have risen slightly. To find Nintendo Switch in stock online, shoppers can use our new The Tracker app, available as free download for iOS and Android.  There are also several new accessories coming on the market from Nintendo in the next weeks. See the full list of new Nintendo Switch accessories. When is Nintendo Switch in stock online again? Nintendo is ramping up the production for the Nintendo Switch, but has not disclosed what the current production capacity per month is. The demand for the Nintendo Switch will spike during the Holiday Shopping season 2017. Nintendo will set aside a large part of the Switch production during the next months for November and December. This stock piling will keep the Nintendo Switch in short supply during the next 5 months. As Nintendo coordinated new Switch console shipment with the launch of Mario Kart 8, we expect the company to do the same for the next major Switch game launches. This means the next big wave of new Switch consoles comes in mid-June for the release of ARMS. The Nintendo Switch will likely be offered in special bundles in time for the Holidays. A Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Switch bundle has already surfaced in Russia. Because of the incredible demand for the Switch console, the monetary savings on these bundles will be limited. Usually bundles offer a way for consumers to get a free game. Nintendo can afford to just offer some savings, unless the demand is slowing down. Read the latest Nintendo Switch news.

By Josh Robbins Updated May 24, 2017 15:57 BST A Walmart shopper was filmed hurling racial slurs at fellow customers on Monday (22 May) in Bentonville, Arakansas. The middle-aged white woman lost her temper with a person identifying as Eva Hicks on Facebook. Hicks filmed the ensuing scene and posted it online. The pair had apparently got in to a dispute over space in the aisle after Hicks had tried to pass the unnamed woman to access medicine from the shelf. "Go back to Mexico, go back, wherever you're from... you're in America," she tells Hicks while gesticulating with her hands. Another customer then interjects to defend Hicks, accusing the woman of being "ignorant." "A n****r's calling me ignorant?" the woman asks rhetorically. The black woman, who is off screen, remarkably keeps her composure and responds: "Yes. Absolutely. All this 'go back to Mexico' and stuff. Absolutely. It's ignorant." The woman then returns to her first target, saying "we don't want you here [America]", at which point the store manager, apparently just arriving on the scene, says: "Yes we do want you here." The manager then patiently tries to calm the woman down but she stands her ground for a couple of minutes, standing behind her trolley – which contains a large multi-pack of toilet paper. The woman lost her temper and hurled racist abuseScreengrab / youtube Footage of the incident has gone viral in part because Shaun King, a New York Daily News journalist, posted it to his Twitter account. King asked Walmart if they would ban the woman from their stores nationwide. The supermarket chain replied that they were "looking into the matter" and agreed that "this [behaviour] cannot be tolerated".

Varun Sood In the year ended 31 March 2017, TCS, Infosys and Wipro saw at least a 20% reduction in the outsourcing business they got from US retailers Wal-Mart, Best Buy, Target Corp. and Sears Holdings. Photo: Bloomberg Bengaluru: One morning in October 2015, a senior executive at Wipro Ltd, was leaving home when he heard news that was disturbing enough for him, a veteran road-warrior, to leave his laptop charger behind. He had just been told by his team in the US that Best Buy, the American electronics retailer, was shutting down 30 stores. Wipro handled several technology processes for the retailer, including testing software and rolling out enterprise application planning software and store inventory management applications. The decision to close stores meant less business for India’s third largest software company. Wipro got business of around $70 million from Best Buy. “The retail industry is fighting its own battle for survival because of e-commerce companies such as Amazon,” the executive said in an informal conversation in October 2015. Now, after a year and a half, this’s even more true. In the year ended 31 March 2017, TCS, Infosys and Wipro saw at least a 20% reduction in the business they got from Wal-Mart Stores Inc, Best Buy Co. Inc., Target Corp., Sears Holdings Corp., and Wm Morrison Supermarkets Plc, according to executives familiar with the development. In May, while announcing results for the three months ended on 31 March, TCS chief executive officer (CEO) Rajesh Gopinathan, Infosys CEO Vishal Sikka and Wipro CEO Abidali Neemuchwala, spoke about weak demand from retail clients on account of “structural changes” witnessed by the retail industry. Retail companies typically spend 2-3% of their total sales on technology, including outsourcing. Over the last few years, large retail firms have been cutting back on their spending on application development or managing back-end infrastructure, focusing on new-age solutions, such as data analytics platforms. Indian IT firms are rarely the beneficiaries. TCS, Wipro, and Infosys do not disclose business from retail clients but estimates suggest that this is around $1.3 billion, $500 million, and $700 million a year, respectively. That’s a bit: for TCS, which counts seven of the largest 10 US-based retail companies as its clients, retail and packaged consumer product companies account for the second biggest chunk of business, after banks and insurers. While the CEOs of the three companies didn’t dwell on the “structural changes” in retail, four executives at the companies who spoke on condition of anonymity laid them out. First, more people, globally, are switching to e-commerce , forcing big box retailers to shut down stores. Best Buy, which saw its stores peak at 1,503 in 2013, ended December 2016 with 1,026 stores. Expectedly, the electronics retailer outsourced less than $50 million in business to Wipro in the year ended March 2017. Two, more retail companies such as Wal-Mart and Target are cutting their dependence on outsourcing companies and looking to do more work themselves, through their captive centres. “Retail companies are realising that they have become technology companies,” said one of the four, a TCS executive. “Smaller teams operating out of captives; automation tools; and ability to connect with start-ups focused on newer technologies is making most of them reconsider why they need IT services companies” Target said that the decision to “in-source” more engineering and technology was not on account of economic challenges but because the retail giant saw more benefit in doing the work itself. “For close to two years now, Target has been sharpening priorities within technology and transforming how our tech team works—moving to a product model from a project model. As part of this, we have shifted the majority of our engineering workforce to internal team members while relying on fewer contractors,” said a spokesperson for Target. “We have hired more than 1,000 engineers in the US and India within the last two years, and our technology performance and results have improved as we’ve made this shift”. “Like any major technology player, we take a holistic look at our projects and the mix of teams who work on them—this includes full-time employees, contractors, consultants, and any hybrid there-of,” said a spokesperson for Wal-Mart. Emails sent to Best Buy, Sears Holdings, and Wm Morrison Supermarkets seeking comment went unanswered. TCS and Infosys declined to offer a comment for this piece, saying that the companies as a policy do not comment on client specific details. An email sent to Wipro seeking comment did not elicit any response. Insourcing is a clear trend, said an expert. “We see many clients (across industries) revisiting their sourcing arrangements. This is driven by the fundamental operating model shift from technologies such as artificial intelligence or machine learning or robotics to work more “agile” which in the optimal scenario requires co-located, cross functional teams,” said Ralf Dreischmeier, London-based head of technology practice at The Boston Consulting Group. “Clients across industries recognize that in order to become a digital leader you need to build world class in-house engineering capabilities and work closely with the broader digital ecosystem which includes tech start-ups as well as the large tech players,” he added. The worry is that other sectors could take a leaf out of retail’s playbook. The banking and financial services business, which accounts for roughly 40% of the revenue of largest Indian IT firms, is already in the throes of change, with start-up fintech companies disrupting incumbents.

Subscribe The Fight for $15 has aligned itself with the resistance movement against President Trump’s agenda, demanding fair wages and practices from the nation’s largest companies that it calls “the Donald Trump of corporations.” Since the November election, coalitions like Resist Reimagine Rebuild Chicago (R3) have formed to fight for labor, immigrant, gender, and racial justice, Adom Getachew told Rewire. A member of R3, the Black Youth Project 100, and the Movement for Black Lives, Getachew said, “We support the Fight for $15 and today’s action against McDonald’s because it is very much aligned with the cause of Black low-wage workers at companies like McDonald’s and Walmart. The Fight for $15 is also about the dignity of workers.” Workers, organizers, and social justice groups will rally at Trump Tower in downtown Chicago and march to the flagship Rock N Roll McDonald’s—the world’s second largest employer, according to movement organizers—at 5:30 p.m. on Tuesday to draw attention to the fast food giant’s unfair practices of wage theft, sexual harassment, ripping off taxpayers, and firing workers for speaking out, according to a news release. Appreciate our work? Rewire is a non-profit independent media publication. Your tax-deductible contribution helps support our research, reporting, and analysis. DONATE NOW “If McDonald’s wants to win back its customers, it needs to prove it respects workers like me—that starts by paying $15 an hour and respecting our right to a union,” said Adriana Alvarez, a McDonald’s worker in Chicago and a Fight for $15 leader in a press release. “We still get paid so little that we have to rely on food stamps and public assistance to raise our families. We still face sexual harassment on the job, and get money stolen from our paychecks. Until McDonald’s respects its workers, Americans will continue to reject the company, and our movement will continue to grow.” Representatives from the Women’s March, Our Revolution, the Movement for Black Lives, MoveOn.org, Color of Change and NextGen will join the biggest ever March on McDonald’s to demand change on the eve of the fast food giant’s corporate shareholder meetings. The fight against Trump has to involve a coalition because you can’t talk about worker and union rights without talking about immigrant rights, women’s rights, racial justice, and how it is intersectional in Chicago and in other places across the country, Getachew said. “Labor rights are women’s rights,” Carmen Perez, co-chair of the Women’s March, said in the release. “The link between the gender justice and labor justice movements is strong—but often unacknowledged. Women’s March is proud to join Fight for $15 and others to rise up against unfair labor practices, economic exploitation and workplace sexual harassment. These fights are our fights, and the only way we win is together.” McDonald’s lost more than 500 million customers since Fight for $15 workers first protested unfair labor practices in 2012. Pressure from the campaign has led to wage theft and child labor scrutiny in Brazil and more than $1 billion in alleged tax evasion in the European Union, according to a 2015 Guardian report. The company has brought digital self-serving kiosks to its 14,000 restaurants in the United States, which some argue is a response to the minimum wage fight. Nevertheless, the protests have continued nationwide. From cooks to cashiers, fast-food workers will head to Oak Brook, Illinois, at 8 a.m. on Wednesday, to take their demand for fair wages and union rights to the shareholders. Parallel protests are planned in more than a dozen cities across the country, the release stated. “Women and men who work 40 hours a week continue to face poverty. McDonald’s continues to stand on the wrong side of worker’s rights by opposing minimum wage increases, paid sick leave, and fair scheduling. We’re marching to tell McDonald’s and other multinational corporations: This greed must end,” said Larry Cohen, chairman of the Our Revolution board, in the release. Since 2012, the fight for fair wages has made $15 a minimum wage in California, New York, Seattle, and Washington, D.C. Wage hikes have totaled more than $62 billion for 22 million underpaid workers by raising awareness and pressuring companies like Aetna, Facebook, JP Morgan Chase, and Nationwide Insurance to raise the bar, according to Fight for $15. Many companies have yet to follow suit. The 2017 Expose Walmart Tour stopped at Dallas City Hall last week to show how Walmart, which claims to pay an average hourly wage of $13.75, often hires workers for much less, according to the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union. The Making Change at Walmart campaign is airing a national ad challenging the company to act responsibly, in multiple cities until Walmart’s annual shareholders meeting on June 2, according to a news release. With 1.5 million workers, Walmart is the largest private employer in the United States, according to Making Change. For fiscal year ending in January 2017, it generated $486 billion in revenues and had $13.6 billion in net income. Speaking to workers across the country for the past five months, the Making Change at Walmart campaign states that it did not find any full-time, non-supervisory employees who made the stated minimum wage. “Tens of thousands of Walmart workers are paid so little that they rely on government assistance programs to survive, like food stamps, Medicaid, and subsidized housing. All programs funded by the taxpayer,” the release stated. Labor and community organizations planned to gather Tuesday morning outside the Fremont Foundry across the street from the Amazon shareholders meeting in Seattle. “The coalition will urge Amazon to be a leader in the private sector by making ethical choices to build a more sustainable economy and a more sustainable future for us all. Speakers will discuss Amazon’s impact, and call on the tech giant to take responsibility for its rapidly expanding footprint,” a release stated. The company recently came under fire for allegedly retaliating against contracted security officers who spoke up about how its Muslim workers are mistreated. It has been criticized for mass low-paying jobs, online privacy issues, worker intimidation, and other unethical business practices. Thousands of workers are gathering in Chicago to continue the fight against regressive policies that harm vulnerable communities. Expanding beyond Illinois, Fight for $15 proponents agree that labor rights are also immigrant, gender, and Black rights, and that big companies need to step up. Organizers said opposition to Trump’s agenda and corporations’ anti-worker policies went hand in hand. “Donald Trump and McDonald’s share a vision for America—where the greed of wealthy corporations reigns supreme,” said Josh B. Fox, an organizer with Indivisible Chicago. “We are incredibly proud to join Fight for $15 in demanding an America where the livelihood and dignity of people come before corporations.” Related Articles Analysis Human Rights Where Trump’s Policies Sow Fear, New Campaign Argues, ‘Corporate Backers of Hate’ Stand to Profit May 11, 9:55am Kari Lindberg News Human Rights Immigrant Workers March on D.C.: ‘Trump Benefits When We Are Divided’ May 2, 6:42pm Tina Vasquez Culture & Conversation Media ‘We’re Not Burdens at All’: A Q&A on Media Coverage and the Murders of Disabled People Apr 6, 11:29am s.e. smith News Human Rights ‘It’s a Civil Rights Issue’: Workers Will March for a Living Wage Apr 3, 3:32pm Auditi Guha Load More Abortion Contraception Economic Justice Environment Family Family Planning Health Systems Human Rights Law and Policy LGBTQ Maternity and Birthing Media Politics Race Religion Science Sexual Health Sexuality Violence False Witnesses State of Abortion Tracking Texas Abortion Access Legislative Tracker Laws Cases States Topics Multimedia Videos Podcasts Photos About Us About Rewire Staff Contributors Contact Us RSS Subscribe Jobs Pitching Guidelines Rewire Facebook Twitter Tumblr © 2017 Rewire.

Rick Scott's desk. Miami Herald If a single House member voted differently, the "liquor wall" bill would not be on Gov. Rick Scott's desk. Miami Herald State Politics May 23, 2017 10:26 AM Will Rick Scott sign or veto 'liquor wall' bill? Two big clues here By Steve Bosuquet Herald/Times Tallahassee Bureau LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Tallahassee Gov. Rick Scott has until Wednesday to decide the fate of one of the most heavily-lobbied bills in years, the removal of the so-called "liquor wall" so that Walmart, Target and other big box stores can sell liquor. Publix and local chain liquor stores tried mightily to kill the bill but it squeaked through the Senate, 21-17, and the House, 58-57, after years of intense lobbying on both sides. The lobbying is now aimed at Scott -- and the clock is ticking. If Scott wants to use "the wall" to thank a friend and punish an enemy at the same time, it's not even a close call. Scott's ally on economic development issues, Senate Appropriations Chairman Jack Latvala, R-Clearwater, is a leading critic of the liquor wall bill who voted no, and Scott's No. 1 nemesis, House Speaker Richard Corcoran, R-Land O'Lakes, is a supporter who voted yes and whose brother, Michael, is a lobbyist for Walmart. Walmart has made three separate contributions to Scott's Let's Get to Work PAC totaling $110,000, including a $50,000 check on March 31, a week after the Senate sent the bill to the House. If the pro-business Republican governor signs this bill, he'll see headlines connecting the two. The bill (SB 106) passed the House amid controversy and allegations, reported here by the Florida Times-Union, that several lawmakers "took a walk" and skipped a close vote to avoid antagonizing special interests and lobbyists on either side. Two absent House members cast no votes after the roll call vote and a third changed his vote from yes to no. Those late votes are in the record but they don't change the outcome of a "board" vote. Still, that alone provides another rationalization for Scott to issue his first veto of the 2017 session. If Scott is looking for five more reasons to veto the bill, at least that many House Republicans who voted to abolish Enterprise Florida also voted to tear down the liquor wall in the spirit of free enterprise. They are Reps. Paul Renner, R-Palm Coast; Jason Brodeur, R-Sanford; Mike LaRosa, R-St. Cloud; Clay Ingram, R-Pensacola; and Frank White, R-Pensacola. They're listed here because Scott called out all five by name and on TV at recent events where he criticized the Legislature for turning its back on Florida's economy.

Photographer: Sergio Flores/Bloomberg AutoZone Inc. reported profit and sales that missed analyst estimates as the seller of car replacement parts joined a chorus of retailers saying U.S. tax refund delays squelched demand early this year. Net income excluding some items was $11.44 per share during the third quarter ended May 6, trailing the low end of 25 analysts’ estimates in a Bloomberg survey. Sales for stores open at least one year declined 0.8 percent, also missing projections. AutoZone joins retailers including Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Foot Locker Inc. in saying customers curbed spending while waiting on tax refunds. Legislation passed in 2015 aimed at preventing fraud may have postponed funds being remitted to 25 million to 30 million U.S. households this year, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. economists wrote in February. “For whatever reason, we don’t quite understand, those refund dollars never seemed to show up,” Chief Executive Officer Bill Rhodes said on a call with analysts. “It has been such a big driver of industry sales, and it just went away.” Capital expenditures at AutoZone’s “mega hub” stores and wage increases fueled by low unemployment also pushed up costs, while a second consecutive mild winter hurt demand for some products, Rhodes said. “What we have experienced over a two-year period of time in the Northeast, Midwestern and mid-Atlantic is alarming,” he said. “It has to do with what’s going on with the weather pattern; we can see it in specific categories that are very related to snow, ice and potholes.” Shares of Memphis, Tennessee-based AutoZone plunged as much as 9.4 percent to $597.45 as of 2:10 p.m. in New York, the biggest intraday drop since November 2008. The stock fell 16 percent this year through the close Monday, trailing the 6.9 percent gain in the S&P 500 Index. Other auto parts and repair chains also declined, including Advance Auto Parts Inc., O’Reilly Automotive Inc. and Monro Muffler Brake Inc. “While the sales slowdown in the industry in February and March was well publicized, it seems the company was in a bigger hole than we had anticipated,” Scot Ciccarelli, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets LLC, wrote in a report Tuesday. “Sales did pick up in April and early May, but not enough to make up for the early quarter shortfall.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Shares of Wal-Mart's stock were climbing around 1 percent during premarket trading following this news. "We delivered a solid first quarter and we're encouraged by the start to the year," Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon said in a statement. "We're moving faster to combine our digital and physical assets to make shopping simple and easy for customers. Our plan is gaining traction." Related: You Probably Shopped at Walmart Last Year On Wednesday, big-box retail rival Target reported earnings, sales and comparable sales that topped Street expectations. Target is in the midst of a multiyear turnaround effort, as it attempts to compete with Wal-Mart's "Everyday Low Price" strategy and Amazon's encroaching presence over the industry. "While [Target] is not trying to directly undercut Walmart on prices, it is trying to use everyday lower prices on daily use items to drive customers into remodeled stores that provide a better experience than Walmart," wrote Stifel analyst Mark Astrachan in a note to clients prior to Thursday's earnings announcement. As of Wednesday's close, shares of Wal-Mart have climbed nearly 19 percent over the past 12 months and are up about 9 percent for the year-to-date period.

Christian Perry and Noah Maxwell used the superstore as a type of hotel. The Southport High School graduates told the Indy Star that their 48-hour stay was anything but a vacation. “About 35 minutes in because I was already getting sick of it,” Perry told the newspaper. The students documented their adventure on their YouTube channel, The Christian and Noah Show. The video is their biggest hit to date, bringing in more than 6,600 views in five days. Perry said they decided to embark on the Walmart escapade in-part because they were frustrated with those who have taken the challenge, but don’t show proof they stayed for the whole duration. To make their stay more enjoyable, the duo played every game in the electronics section and arcade, read books, and listened to podcasts. They drew some dirty looks from the store’s security during their time in the store. To avoid being kicked out, the two would buy things periodically. They even got haircuts at the in-store salon. “We quickly realized if we buy stuff like every three hours, they can’t really say anything to us because we’re customers. So we spent a lot of money in there,” Perry told the Star. Now that Perry has completed the 48-hour challenge, he says he doesn’t plan on stepping foot inside a Walmart again for a very long time. Perry and Maxwell plan on moving to California after graduating to pursue comedy.

It was a normal trip to the grocery store for Eva Hicks until she turned down the medicine aisle. “I encountered this lady that was on my way and I asked her politely, you know, if I could pass, and I said, ‘Excuse me,’ and she was being very hateful, immediately,” Hicks said. The confrontation was caught on camera. Woman: Get out of here. Eva Hicks: No I’m not going to get out of here. Woman: Go back to Mexico. Eva Hicks: No! No I’m not! Woman: You’re just going to stand here and argue. Eva Hicks: No, because this is my country. Woman: Your country? Eva Hicks: Yes, this is my country. Woman: This is not your country? Eva Hicks: Oh yes it is. Woman: We don’t want you here Eva Hicks: Yes it is, I don’t care. Manager: That’s not true, we do want you here. Woman: We don’t want you here Eva Hicks: Oh yes it is. Manager: That’s not true, we do want you here. Eva Hicks: I don’t care what you want or not. Manager: We do want you here. Woman: Leave me alone. Manager: That’s not true. Woman: Go. Go. Hicks said the incident upset her so much because of her love for the area. “This country has given me so much, so much opportunities for me, for my family, for my kids. It is a beautiful country. This is a free country,” Hicks said. During the incident, several bystanders and a store manager stepped in to defend Hicks. “I felt love. I felt like, yes I belong here. There is no reason for someone to treat me less, just because my skin is different, just because I have an accent, just because I was born in a different country,” Hicks said. The unidentified woman also made comments to another woman who was attempting to help. Shopper: Stop being ignorant Woman: A n***** is calling me ignorant? Hicks said she just wants to put the encounter in the past and wants the best for the other woman. “I just wish her good, it’s really sad to see somebody like that,” Hicks said. The assistant manager did ask the woman to leave the store. They also gave a statement saying, “We value respect for everyone who visits our stores. We have no tolerance for the language or actions of this customer and are proud to see that our assistant manager responded appropriately by asking her to leave the store.”   WHAT OTHERS ARE CLICKING ON: BOTULISM DEATH REPORTED IN NAPA COUNTY 9-YEAR-OLD OAKLAND BOY SHOT WHILE WALKING HIS DOG ON HIS BIRTHDAY  DANVILLE BANK ROBBER WITH FAKE BEARD ID’D AS FORMER COP SAN FRANCISCO STATE BUILDING EVACUATED DUE TO BOMB THREAT PREGNANT SENIOR NOT ALLOWED TO WALK AT GRADUATION TOXICOLOGIST TESTIFIES ON SIERRA LAMAR’S KILLER’S PESTICIDE EXPOSURE MUG SHOT: ‘JOKER’ ARRESTED FOR POINTING GUN AT CARS FATHER OF SUSPECTED MANCHESTER BOMBER SAYS SON IS INNOCENT >> MORE TOP STORIES Share this: Click to email (Opens in new window) More Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) Related Posts VIDEO: Thief ‘ghost rides’ to snatch woman’s purse, spends $5k on stolen credit cards VIDEO: 14 killed by storms and flooding in South and Midwest Police: Woman caught switching flour with baby formula VIDEO: Employees get into brawl at Houston 99-Cents Only store Advertisement « Previous Story — Next Story » Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

Hutchinson say free trade ties important to Arkansas BusinessLatest NewsManufacturingTalk Politics by Wesley Brown (wesbrocomm@gmail.com) 7 hours ago 40 views  Tags: Arkansas exports 0 SHARES Share Tweet A top executive for Walmart’s international operations expressed deep support for maintaining strong bilateral free trade alliances abroad, advising more than 200 people at an annual luncheon spotlighting the state’s top exporters that there is great opportunity in global trade. Maggie Sans, senior vice president and chief affairs officers for Wal-Mart Stores’ China operations, told the audience at the Arkansas District Export Council’s annual Governor’s Awards for Excellence in Global Trade, that the Bentonville retail giant is a “vociferous advocate” for free trade. “Many of you here know Wal-Mart well, and you know everything for us begins with the customers,” said Sans, the keynote speaker. “Around the globe, our goal is to save people money so they can live better.” Sans told the business-friendly crowd at the Governor’s Mansion that since Wal-Mart established its first international presence with a Sam’s Club location in Mexico City, the company is now serving some 260 million customers a week in 28 countries across the globe. Sans said Wal-Mart has the same goal as most Arkansas companies involved in trade overseas. “While our businesses are different in size and scope, we all want the same thing. We want to serve customers well, and we want to run a profitable and sustained business,” Sans said. Sans said as the digital economy has exploded, the service sector has also grown significantly and impacted the company’s foreign investment and trade. She said with inconsistent rules and tariffs in different countries, Wal-Mart has had to navigate many hurdles to get products to market in a cost-effective manner. Sans also noted a recent Kinsey Global Institute estimating that more than $67 trillion in new infrastructure will be necessary over the next 15 years to meet global demand. “The opportunities for American companies doing business will grow with it, and I hope Arkansas businesses can be on the winning side of that growth,” she said. After Sans’ speech, Gov. Asa Hutchinson presented the Governor’s Awards for Excellence in Global Trade to five Arkansas manufacturers and service providers that contribute to the Arkansas economy through international trade. Before he made the presentations, Hutchinson talked about recognition for Arkansas that came from the Organization for International Investment (OII), which said that in the past five years Arkansas’ foreign direct investment employment growth of 41.5% has doubled the national average. Hutchinson first mentioned the OII recognition during a speech last week at an economic development conference in Pine Bluff that focused on the Arkansas Delta. Maggie Sans, senior vice president and chief affairs officers for Wal-Mart’s operations, speaks at annual luncheon for the Governor’s Awards for Excellence in Global Trade. “Trade is vitally important for Arkansas. Increasing exports of Arkansas-made and Arkansas-grown products results in two excellent outcomes,” said Hutchinson, who has made several trade missions abroad during his nearly 2-1/2 years in office. “It produces extra capital for companies to invest in their facilities and creates new employment opportunities for Arkansans.” Hutchinson, who plans to make additional trips to Europe and the Far East later this summer, told the audience a story about his interaction with President Donald Trump during a White House visit earlier this year where they discussed global trade. “I made the point to the president that he talked a lot about being tough on global trade, but I wanted to remind (him) that in Arkansas, we’re part of that global marketplace,” Hutchinson said. “Whether it’s rice that we export, or aero-defense products or electrical machinery, exports are so important to us … and I made that point to the president.” Following are some of this year’s winners of the Governor’s Awards for Excellence in Global Trade. • Arkansas Rising Star – Lycus, Ltd., LLC – El Dorado • Advance Technologies & STEM Exporter – Lockheed Martin Missiles & Fire Control – Camden • Small Manufacturer Exporter – Garreco Dental, LLC – Heber Springs • Medium Manufacturer Exporter – AK Industrial Contractors – Searcy • Large Manufacturer Exporter- Cooper Tire & Rubber Company – Texarkana This is the eighth year for the program which is co-sponsored by the Arkansas District Export Council, Arkansas Economic Development Commission, U.S. Commercial Service, and the Arkansas World Trade Center. Council members are appointed by the U.S. Secretary of Commerce and actively encourage manufacturers across the state to consider exporting as a realistic opportunity for growth. Judging criteria was based on factors such as most recent percentage of export sales to total sales, growth of export sales over the past three years, the company’s goals and commitments internationally and the number of jobs saved or created due to the company’s export performance if applicable. According to U.S. Commerce Department data, Arkansas’s export shipments of merchandise in 2016 totaled $5.7 billion. Additionally, there are 2,365 companies and almost 50,000 jobs that depend on Arkansas exports. The state’s largest trade partners in 2016 were Canada ($1.2 billion), France ($783 million), Mexico ($686 million) and Japan ($281 million).

The latest effort is with Utah's Powder Mountain, designed as a purpose-built community. This photo is not of author Steve Andrews.               The invite email for the Summit Series said to check in by 4 p.m. but it's 3:45 p.m. and I'm still roughly half an hour away according to my phone's map. It's hard to keep my eyes on the road because I'm passing incredible possibilities for untouched powder lines as I weave through Utah's Ogden Canyon. I had to make an emergency pitstop at Wal-Mart after the timely realization that I never took my underlayers out of the dryer. At least the lightbulb went off before I got to the hill. Surely there has to be some buffer time to allow for late arrivals like myself, considering the majority of the guests for this weekend are flying into Salt Lake City on a Friday.  As I race through Eden — population 600 with only one gas station and no stoplights — I fail to consider that a lack of cell-phone reception prevents me from checking the directions in my email. I remember reading the check-in location is called Bower Lodge, so I speed uphill on Powder Mountain. I ask a few people where to find Bower, only to meet puzzled faces with no idea what I'm talking about. I zigzag my way between lodges with no luck until I finally reach the top where a ski-patrol shack sits at the end of the road. Surely they will know where it is. They are friendly and welcoming, but after telling them my intention to write a story on the changes taking place here, the room goes quiet and they look around at one another. Another patroller remarks: "No comment" while everyone else laughs.  Another one pipes up: "Come back with a bottle of tequila and we'll tell you some stories."  The guy to my left realizes that the lodge in question is the old clubhouse at the golf course back down in the valley. I thank them and speed back down to check in with no time to spare. While weaving back down toward Eden, my first note-to-self is: Fun-looking mountain but at US$40 million they could probably afford a couple of signs. The Summit Series started as an offer for a free ski weekend from a college dropout wanting to fast-track how to become a successful entrepreneur.  Elliot Bisnow and his "dream list" of 19 people has now blossomed into a community of more than 10,000 individuals who converge under the Summit banner several times a year.  According to their website: "Summit creates unique gatherings designed to catalyze entrepreneurship, creative achievement, and global change to create a more joyful world." To put it another way, they produce events that bring together people who want to meet other big-idea people.   Four years ago, the same people crowd-sourced the funds to purchase Powder Mountain and the land that it's built upon. After 10 years as a brand, Summit now has a home as stewards of an old ski resort that bears the oxymoron of being famous for the fact that nobody knows about it. The group intends to develop a town roughly the size of Telluride — at about 180 hectares with a population of about 2,300 — to serve as a hub for innovators, artists, and anyone else who dreams of a better society. But who doesn't, really? Especially when it comes to the jargon we see in developer's marketing collateral. What makes these guys different? Is it possible to balance their lofty ideals with the end goal that all investors will turn a profit? Is the Summit weekend just an elaborately produced effort to attract buyers to a new purpose-built community in which a few investors stand to make a huge pile of money? That's certainly one way to look at it, and even if that were the only motive, it could be a brilliant marketing campaign in mountain-resort real estate. The founders share high ideals and a grand vision that includes creating co-op work spaces, open venues to encourage interaction, and Burning-Man inspired art installations throughout their new town. But Summit's founders aren't from the mountains, they bought into it. Will the fast-paced city mentality influence the mountain community they hope to create? Or can it be the other way around where the landscape and open spaces help these high-profile influencers not take themselves and life too seriously? FIRST STEPS Powder Mountain has operated as a ski resort for more than 45 years. Rising high above Eden, the area is relatively unknown in comparison to nearby Park City and the resorts within the Cottonwood Canyons.  Eden itself is nothing more than a prime example of resort gentrification: large parcels of land subdivided over the past few decades to make room for townhouses that pack in weekenders from Salt Lake City and points beyond. The mountain's 4,000 hectares receive over 12 metres of Utah's famously dry snow yearly; enough to cause most snow-lovers to take notice. But until the latest change of ownership occurred just over three years ago, the local skiers and boarders rejoiced in their well-kept secret of the lack of crowds.It was their biggest asset. Now that Summit is at the helm, there is potential for Powder Mountain to show up on a radar of skiers and non-skiers: their market is the rich, elite city dwellers from New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco and elsewhere who are keen to escape their urban habitat and connect with other like-minded individuals here. Summit began 10 years ago on the Utah ski slopes. The then-22-year old Bisnow wanted to connect with bright minds. In 2005 Bisnow and his father founded Bisnow Media, which last year they sold for a reported $50 million. But early on, as a fresh college dropout, Bisnow admittedly was in over his head. "In my quest to just meet other entrepreneurs and get advice I cold-called 20 people that I'd read about," Bisnow said. "I invited Blake (Mycoskie) from TOMS shoes, and Ricky (Van Veen) and Josh (Abramson) who started (the popular video website) Collegehumor. We went skiing in Alta, which is just over an hour from Powder Mountain. I actually paid for the trip on my credit card and got sponsors to cover the costs. And that was the first Summit." That first meeting was so successful that the group decided to meet again six months later — that time inviting a few more friends and business associates. Steadily the word got out of a gathering of like minds across a wide spectrum of industry with the shared assumption that humanity as a whole is greater than the sum of its individuals. The events became more polished and headline speakers included Quentin Tarantino, Erin Brockovich, and Kendrick Lamar. Additionally you can meander between a full slate of activities including yoga, meditation sessions, even arts and crafts: I made a leather bracelet on Sunday afternoon that I'm pretty proud of. Deals were made and companies were born. Over a short time, the Summit events blossomed and became a destination for self-professed visionaries who were keen to interact and rub shoulders with each other. PURCHASING A MOUNTAIN Greg Mauro, Venture capitalist by day and skier by heart, had been looking for a mountain home for some time. His parents owned a house in Aspen, where his love of the mountains was fostered. But by the turn of the millennium, Aspen had morphed into an overwhelming monstrosity of a resort destination that had lost its small-town charm. He tried living in different areas, including Whistler in 2001. Eventually he discovered the relative solitude of Powder Mountain and fell in love. He invited friends to visit, but on the condition that any photos they took or tales of endless powder runs should be misrepresented as Park City in fear this secret would get out. In 2011, the owners put Powder Mountain up for sale. Originally the plan was to develop three golf courses and a town of 10,000, a vision that sounded all too familiar to this Whistlerite. But those owners couldn't cut it. It was the aftermath of the 2008 recession and their vision was dead in the water. Mauro saw the opportunity to make a deal and approached Summit with an out-of-the blue offer. "We flew out the next day," Bisnow said of the response to Mauro's offer. "He (Mauro) said there's this unbelievable 10,000-acre ski area called Powder Mountain. I think we can get in there and buy it for an unbelievable price and could do something really special." As the Summit members and Mauro looked over the expansive Wasatch mountain range and Salt Lake Basin on a site that would eventually become the Sky Lodge, an unexpected alliance formed virtually overnight. Mauro would ensure that the day-to-day operation of the resort was profitable and the Summit team would focus on building a community by attracting buyers through their trademark events.  In 2013 Powder Mountain changed ownership for $40 million with a consortium of young Millennials at the helm — the first time a group from the new generation was in charge of this type of resort development.  To finance the deal, they crowd-funded the purchase and had no trouble raising the money. The new owners produce events, but they didn't know squat about mountain-community development. "We studied about 30 different mountain communities from all over the world," Bisnow said. "We looked at Aspen, Park City, Telluride. We also looked to communities in Europe and even places like SoHo and Windward Walls in Miami." Bisnow's main concern is the ski-resort explosion of "McMansions" and the "era of huge houses."  In an effort to prevent that from happening at Powder Mountain, they are limiting house sizes to 4,500 square feet, with the majority of the homes taking up around 2,500. The ideal is to blend the homes with the natural environment.  And lots are selling like hotcakes, ranging from $225,000 to more than $2 million. WHO BUYS INTO THIS? On this weekend in late January, the candle-lit steps direct us upstairs toward the commotion taking place inside the Timberline Lodge. At 40 years old, it's the closest thing to a historical building on the mountain. I introduce myself to anyone and everyone and in less than half an hour I meet venture capitalists, app-developers, real-estate tycoons, a New York Times columnist, and a famous movie director as we gather at a long-table dinner that encourages a family-style meal among strangers. Summit co-founder Jeff Rosenthal tells us that the mission "is to inspire entrepreneurs and innovators from different backgrounds." The criteria has always been the same, he says: "Are you innovators of your discipline, regardless of your level or age? And are you nice people who we want to be around, regardless of personal or professional success?" It sounded fairly clichéd to me. Of course, you want to be around the people you are around, nothing profound there. But at the same time it hints at exclusivity: who judges whether or not a candidate is someone they want to be around? And what if that perception changes? Human nature being what it is, what he said sounded nice, but I know that you can't build a community under those pretenses, no matter how hard you try. He also set a few ground rules: No social media content inside the lodges; and no drinking and driving. Through a Cadillac sponsorship the event featured brand-new black Escalades as shuttles to the venues between mountain and valley. Riding in the $100,000 SUV helped me feel special, but it isn't enough for me to want to drink the Kool-Aid. This event took place a week after Donald Trump was inaugurated as the 45th president of the U.S., a fact that is unavoidable in conversation. To my relief, many here are as dumbfounded as I am at what had happened. Through dozens of discussions I realize this crowd is well-off, but they're not ostentatious. As everyone finds seats at the table, I sit down next to Colin Eckles: He's in his early 30s and made his fortune selling real estate in China. He now splits his time between Los Angeles and Hawaii, and is developing his own community on 200 hectares on Hawaii's big island — a community that will feature biodynamic agriculture and follow permaculture principles. He wants to construct seven buildings to serve as spiritual centres, coinciding with the seven chakras. "I did the tour," he says, referring to the Summit realty team's guided mountain tour. "And I'm in. I bought a lot."   Eckles was not the only person I spoke to over the weekend who purchased a lot after seeing the land and Summit's plans to orchestrate a new community.  Sitting down for a rest at the Sky Lodge on Saturday afternoon, I met a board member of a high-profile sports brand who made the deposit last year and finally pulled the trigger this weekend to secure his lot. "Now I just have to tell my wife," he says with a nervous grin. At prices up to $2 million or more per home site, it is similar to the Sea to Sky market; although this purpose-built community has a collective intention for 'good business.' The people I meet seem to have an earnest desire to grow a community that differs from other mountain towns. Bisnow himself is building a family home where he plans to raise his kids in this exclusive little hub. This is not a pump-and-dump scheme, and the endgame will be — for now — a mountain community in which everyone is from a similar socio-economic background and shares the same modus operandi of getting rich off of really big, successful ideas. Comparisons could be made: Is it a rich-kids' club? Cult-like? Maybe a bit of both. The people running the show regard art, intelligence, and community as their biggest assets, at least on paper. Their plans promise a respect for Mother Nature and the hope to symbiotically coexist and not to conquer. But come on, don't we all buy into this? And haven't we been duped before? What was obviously missing from the weekend was the dirtbags. This was an affluent, educated bunch of people, but they weren't from the mountains. The group was still coated with their veneer from New York or San Francisco, showing that it's easier said than done to take the city out of the city folk. Mountain culture is much different from SoHo or the Mission district and a big indicator of success will be whether this community can adapt to mountain life by not taking itself too seriously. Will they buy a new jacket when it rips after shredding through the trees, or easily fix it with a strip of duct tape? The urban intellectuals have descended upon the mountains, but will these guys rent out one of their rooms to the dishpig in the back of the kitchen working tirelessly at one of their marquee dinners? Where the Summit team will really have to prove itself is in how well they coexist with the third and fourth generation of Weber County locals who call Powder their home mountain; who love it for its lack of outside attention.  After Summit bought Powder Mountain, Facebook comments were quick and dirty: "Just a bunch of trust-a-farian douchebags that are going to ruin the valley. If you like waste, conspicuous consumption, and rich, overprivileged assholes that drive Escalades in $500 worth of couture "winter apparel" that has never seen actual use, by all means keep making these human-shaped bags of spiders more rich by buying lift tickets to their private mountain. To the very last person, they are a complete waste of blood and organs..." After I followed up with the guy who posted that, he had this to say: "I was unfortunate enough to work for Powder Mountain during the buyout, and subsequently walked off the job with most of the food and beverage staff because they fired the long-time F&B (food and beverage) director with no notice, to bring on a Summit kid." That Feeling The frigid morning air stings my face as I step outside the condo, a gorgeous unit that Summit must have rented from a local family. I can only assume the family owns it from the abundance of creepy portraits where everyone wears the same outfit. The clear blue sky is accentuated with a purple alpenglow sunrise on the eastern hillsides, beckoning all the early-birds who had the discipline to get home at a reasonable hour last night. I run into my new buddy Eckles and we head up the lift. It hasn't snowed for more than five days so I'm not hopeful of finding fresh powder. Yet Powder Mountain's slogan is: Preserving the Powder. There are still countless untracked lines right next to the lift that opened only today. The policies here differ from other resorts: They don't open every lift immediately, which ensures they can still open new terrain in between storms; and they cap day-ticket sales at 2,000 a day. Yes — so across this 4,000-hectare terrain, it means there is always plenty of untracked snow for everyone, even five days after the last storm. For an extra fee of $18 you can take a snowcat up Lightning Ridge toward James Peak for some of the longest off-piste freeride terrain in Utah — something I see as a selling point but may be deemed as extreme by most. The terrain can't hold a candle to what we have in the Coast Mountains, but to be fair, not much can. If Summit is true to its slogan and wants to preserve powder, my main wish would be to save these incredible runs for those who really work for it. Although tracks are present in the trees, the most difficult lines are still fresh for me to leisurely shralp without the pressure to go, go, go like I do at home. Whether hiking, taking a cat or bus, or just eyeing good runs from the lift, there is enough terrain to keep me interested. I find challenging, yet easy-access lines that would have been tracked out at resorts with a bigger scene. This is not an advanced group of skiers and boarders attending this weekend, and for the majority the rolling terrain is more than enough to satisfy. But the Paradise chair was ripe with enough cliffs and pillows to keep even the most discerning powder hound content until the closing bell. It gives me a sense of privacy and solitude that I haven't felt at a ski resort, and it is enough for me to consider that if I were wealthy enough to buy a lot, I would also see a return beyond the financial. I'd be one of the best skiers or boarders on the mountain and would have my pick of challenging terrain without fear of it getting tracked out. My riding partner and I differ greatly in ability but it doesn't matter. Part of the magic of snow sports is the ability to choose your own line and meet up at the bottom of the pitch. As I learn more about Eckles and his past I see how much this trip means to him: He tells me of his high-stress, high-stakes real-estate ventures and the resulting epiphany that life is not all about money. I admire his altruistic intentions for his own development plans, which give me a bit of reassurance that I chose the right path for myself by neglecting the city life and opting to live in the mountains. Like most of us, we come alive when we are given the freedom to creatively express our movement in nature. It's a decidedly first-world luxury that does have its purpose: it helps us lighten up and be present.  The world certainly needs more of that. As much fun as it is to make a new friend, the urge to push myself is too great and I split with Eckles to find some more challenging terrain. I find it in Powder Country, a zone that has no lift at the bottom but instead has a bus that takes you up the canyon back into the resort. Deep snow, a steep pitch, and a few drops are enough to satisfy my craving before heading back into the Sky Lodge for lunch. Steve Andrews was a guest of the Summit Group. He really enjoyed the buffets, free beer, meeting amazing people, and exploring those untracked lines. But for the price tag of $1 million to $2 million, he would put his lessons learned at Summit toward building his own mountain utopia somewhere up north.

Police officers at the scene noticed that Anglin was frantically digging through his car, which had flipped over onto its roof. Anglin told officers he was trying to get rings and other valuables out of the car, according to a police report. Officers found a used hypodermic needle and a burnt spoon with suspected heroin residue in the car. An officer then found Anglin slumped over and sleeping in the back of the cruiser. Police said a search of the police cruiser revealed another used needle containing a small amount of heroin inside. The officer said the needle wasn’t inside the cruiser prior to the start of his shift. 5:09 p.m. – 400 block of Upland Ave., Braquan Walker, 18, was charged with receiving stolen property, obstructing official business, failure to comply with a police order, and driving without a license following a police chase. Police said they attempted to pull over an SUV driven by Walker because the vehicle was reported stolen, according to a police report. Walker took off and led police on a chase through several streets, running stop signs and driving erratically, even narrowly missing a school bus, the report said. Walker finally stopped on Dennick Avenue and four males jumped out of the SUV and ran. Police caught two teens and Walker, but a fourth suspect got away. 6:30 p.m. – 600 block of Millet Ave., Jordan Mountain, Dashonti Baker and James Muldrow were arrested following a drug raid. Officers with a warrant stopped Mountain, who was driving away from the Millet Ave. home. He was found with a glass pipe and a folded piece of paper containing crack, according to a police report. Officers then went to the home, where police said Baker and Muldrow were seen through a window trying to flush items down the toilet.

There are, however, right ways – and perhaps just plain “better” ways — to go about this. My family has been camping for more than a decade. That makes us almost professional campers, doesn’t it? It’s fair to think we’d have it all dialed in by now. But then is there any camping trip three trips to Walmart (there’s always a Walmart) and $300 can’t fix? Why yes, there is! Take, for example, the trip my husband, Matt, and his friend, Steve, embarked on recently in which they planned to fish and explore the wild and majestic Lake of the Ozarks. Many, many weeks of planning went into that trip. They googled this, binged that, mapquested the other thing. Google Earth assured them beyond a doubt they were about to commence on a journey on which they would become one with nature, living for a period of four days on the wooded shores of one of the most pristine bodies of water there is. In fact, it was most miraculous they were even able to obtain such a coveted spot on that lake. Surely, the camping Gods were smiling down upon these two Sons of Nature and nodding their heads in approval. Soon the packing began. Shorts, T-shirts, sandals, fishing rods and other gear – even sunscreen – was packed into duffle bags and backpacks. The weatherman promised sunshine and 75-degree weather. They could hardly believe their luck! Another week came and went. There was story-telling and long farewells. Among them, a visit to my parents. My dad was particularly enthralled by the idea of a trip to the Lake of the Ozarks, and he wanted to make sure his son-in-law had done his homework. He asked, “Did you write a letter to the Chamber?” We were amused by the question. Seriously. Who would send a letter when there is all-knowing Google? No, Dad. Not necessary. It’s all covered. We’ve got this. The next day they were on the road at 4 a.m. and 12 hours later they pulled into town. The weather was cold and rainy. My husband’s stomach turned. Lake of the Ozarks boasts a clean and wholesome setting, but the scenery instead was one of bars, strip-clubs and trash scattered like boils festering on the face of a once-beautiful landscape. Oh well, at least there’s always fishing, right? Matt’s stomach turned again. Was it something he ate? When Matt and Steve finally arrived at their reserved campsite, my husband noticed two things. First, that queezy feeling in the pit of his stomach hadn’t left but had in fact grown worse, spreading to what he recognized were indeed flu symptoms. Second, the lake site the camping Gods had bestowed upon them was not a lake at all. At least not at the moment. To their astonishment, they had purchased a four-day view of a sea of muck, orphaned flip-flops and abandoned empty oil containers. The lake they had driven through three states to fish on had been drained, along with their hopes for fishing. Matt and Steve toughed it out those four days — Matt with the flu. The sun never came out, and the rain poured so much it could’ve filled that drained lake. But, it didn’t. The morals of this story? • There are some camping trips three trips to Walmart and $300 can’t actually fix. • Never trust the weatherman. • One way to appreciate your own bed more than you ever thought you could is to endure the flu for four days in a pop-up camper 650 miles away from home. • Yes, dad, sorry, you were right. The advice attained from a human being compared to Google can be a thousand times more valuable and, in certain situations, may even warrant a letter to the Chamber. It could save you from catching flip-flops with your fishing rod in a drained lake. About Latest Posts Carolyn Bertsch Bertsch has enjoyed working for the Newsleaders since 2015.

Roz Edward, Michigan Chronicle Managing Editor Leave a comment 1 reads Source: Getty / Getty Another racist made an appearance on video at a Walmart in Arkansas. A White woman is filmed spewing insults at a Latin and Black woman. The video was posted Monday on Facebook by Eva Hicks, who was the victim of the verbal attacks. “Go back to Mexico,” the unidentified White woman told Hicks. “Go back … wherever you’re from.” Watch the disturbing video below: The clip has been viewed 15 million times and shared over 220,000 times so far. A Walmart representative told NBC News that they have been trying to contact Hicks to apologize, but they haven’t gotten a response. They also reported that they were trying to contact the woman who tried to help Hicks. The senior director of Walmart media relations, Randy Hargrove, said the White woman’s behavior was “unacceptable.” “We value and respect everyone who visits our stores,” he said. “We have no tolerance for the language or actions of this customer and are proud that our assistant manager responded appropriately by asking her to leave the store.” Hargrove explained that the company officials have yet to identify the woman dropping racist insults, but he said once they did, she would be barred from all Walmart locations.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Wal-Mart Is Turning the Corner The retail giant posted its first quarterly increase in profit last week in more than two years. Here's why things should only get better from here. Jeremy Bowman (TMFHobo) May 24, 2017 at 5:19PM In October 2015, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) slashed its profit guidance for the following year, saying it would invest in higher wages and cleaner stores in order to ensure long-term success. Management said, "As a result of investments in wages and training as well as our commitment to further developing a seamless customer experience, we expect earnings per share to decline between 6% and 12% in fiscal 2017 (calendar 2016)," adding that EPS would rebound with a 5% to 10% increase in fiscal year 2019 (calendar 2018). Image source: Wal-Mart. Wall Street responded with a massive sell-off as the stock fell more than 8%, its worst one-day performance since the recession. Clearly, the market saw Wal-Mart's move as a sign of weakness as it caved to pressure from Amazon.com, and analysts seemed skeptical that Wal-Mart would be able to return to steady growth.  However, Wal-Mart's latest quarterly report a year-and-a-half later makes it clear that the company is well on its way to fulfilling that promise. A return to profit growth The retail giant delivered its first quarter of profit growth in more than two years last week as earnings per share increased 2% to $1, coming at the top end of the company's guidance and beating analyst estimates. Wal-Mart also posted its 11th consecutive quarter of same-store sales growth, a streak that many retailers have been unable to match, including rivals like Kroger (NYSE:KR) and Target (NYSE:TGT), each of whom reported same-store sales declines in their most recent quarters. In order to maintain that streak of same-store sales growth, Wal-Mart has had to overcome challenges including e-commerce competition and food deflation that have crushed sales growth at its supermarket peers. Wal-Mart, which derives more than half of its domestic sales from groceries, has lowered its prices to grab more market share in the category, one of many savvy strategic moves the company has recently made. The company has set a goal of having grocery prices 15% below the competition 80% of the time. As a result, it has clawed back market share it had previously lost to grocers like Kroger as well as the dollar store chains. Why profits should continue to grow When Wal-Mart cut its profit forecast in 2015, it did something that almost all publicly trade companies are reluctant do. It sacrificed short-term performance for long-term gains, and, as it often does, Wall Street punished for it doing so. But there is now sufficient evidence that those moves are paying off as the increase in profits indicates. Wal-Mart's e-commerce sales skyrocketed last quarter, jumping 63% on the strength of its decision in January to offer free two-day shipping on orders over $35. Expanding its online inventory from 10 million to 50 million and increasing the number of grocery pickup kiosks also drove the surge in online sales. Last summer, Wal-Mart acquired Jet.com for $3.3 billion, bringing its Founder Marc Lore into the fold. Lore now runs Wal-Mart's U.S. e-commerce division and has been the force behind much of the recent improvements. Investments like that and expansion of the grocery pickup program will continue to pay off much in the same way that investing in higher wages and better training has led to higher customer satisfaction in its stores. As long as same-store sales continue to increase and e-commerce grows at a robust pace, Wal-Mart's profits will move higher. The company has made the bulk of the needed investments to ensure its success and investors can now begin reaping the benefits. The stock has already bounced back 37% since the sell-off in 2015.

(Lorenzo Salinas/The News) By L.V. Salinas email More News Walmart evacuated over threat Published 4:44 pm Wednesday, May 24, 2017 Shoppers at the Walmart Supercenter on Twin City in Port Arthur were evacuated along with employees when a threat was called in Wednesday. Port Arthur police and fire units responded to a call near noon, according to PAPD Lt. John Owens. “We got a report of a possible threat to the store,” Owens said. “And, in an abundance of caution, management asked patrons to leave until the fire department and police could investigate the premises to ensure there was no device or any reason for alarm.” Owens said, “And we investigated — everything is clear and uneventful.” After waiting about 30 minutes outside, employees and shoppers were allowed back into the store at 12:35 p.m. Among the people outside were shoppers who were waiting to get back to their vehicles parked near the store or to the groceries they had left inside when the evacuation announcement had come. “They said on the intercom, ‘Evacuate the store. Everyone evacuate; everyone evacuate,’” Mark Hilton said. Hilton was one of the people waiting towards the back of the Walmart parking lot and whose groceries were still in the store. “I don’t know if it was a drill or not; then everyone started leaving,” he said. Saundra Miranda was one of the shoppers who had come during the evacuation notice. “We were pulling in when their employees flagged us off,” she said. “They said it was a bomb threat.” As of press deadline, Port Arthur police could not confirm at this time what kind of threat was called in. “I don’t know what society and the world are coming to,” Miranda said. “Especially the next generation. Young children don’t understand.” Print Article Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

Wal-Mart Stores is gaining a bigger slice of the $800 billion market and momentum picked up in the recent first quarter, according to a new report. "Wal-Mart is taking back share from the traditional supermarket at an accelerating rate," according to Loop Capital analyst Andrew Wolf, who estimates the retailer now has a 21.5 percent market share in the U.S. traditional grocery industry. In a report this week, Wolf said the world's biggest retailer's domestic grocery same-store sales beat U.S. supermarkets by 2.9 percent in the first quarter, which represented a stronger pace from 1.6 percent outperformance in the fourth quarter of 2016. "Wal-Mart's last period of sustained outperformance versus the supermarkets was 2009-2010, while from 2013 through Q3'2016, the supermarkets outperformed Wal-Mart at same stores," Wolf said. Added the analyst, "Thus, the last quarter of outperformance appear to mark a potential major inflection point for Wal-Mart after having been a (same-store) share donor since 2013." show chapters Buy Wal-Mart on sale?    Thursday, 18 May 2017 | 8:16 PM ET | 02:05 Wal-Mart's strong performance in the first quarter was helped in part of lower deflation but also by continued pricing investment by the Arkansas-based company as it seeks to better against Kroger, European-based discounter Aldi and other grocers. In the past month, there have been reports of price drops at Wal-Mart supermarkets in major U.S. markets where Kroger and others compete. "Kroger has discussed that while certain markets are indeed more competitive, such as those in which Wal-Mart is changing prices, certain other markets are less competitive than normal," said Wolf. Wal-Mart didn't respond to a request for comment. Kroger declined comment. Still, Wolf said Kroger still is showing some strength even as it faces more competition from Wal-Mart and others, including Amazon's push into the online grocery market. Kroger has its own online grocery strategy, which includes both delivery through third-party delivery services as well an in-store pickup option. Wal-Mart too is aggressively pushing into the online grocery segment. "Like Wal-Mart, Kroger is pursuing an e-commerce grocery 'click and collect' model, for which customers order online and pick up their orders at store," Wolf said. "We believe this will be an increasing feature of U.S. grocery shopping going forward."

By Donie O'Sullivan NEW YORK (CNN) -- Walmart says it will ask a customer to no longer shop at their stores after she was caught on video hurling racial abuse at other customers in Bentonville, Arkansas, on Monday. Video posted to Facebook on Monday night that shows a woman telling one customer to "go back to Mexico" and calling another customer a racial epithet has been shared hundreds of thousands of times on the social network. Eva Hicks, a mother of three, said she politely asked the woman to step to one side as she reached for medicine. It was then the woman became aggressive, Hicks told CNN. "She moved back her cart and immediately started saying that people bother her on every aisle, and started saying more hateful things to me," Hicks recounted and then took out her phone and began to record the encounter. The woman, who has not been identified, told Hicks to "go back to Mexico" and accused her of being rude. Another woman off-camera intervenes and tells the woman to stop being "ignorant." The woman on camera responds, "a n***er's calling me ignorant?" "I have never experienced anything like that in my life," Hicks said. "Nobody has ever talked to me like that, I felt very insulted and unwanted." Hicks, originally from Mexico City, says she has been living in the United States for more than 30 years. In the video she tells the woman that this is her home. "It's not your country, we don't want you here," the woman retorted. "I am an American citizen, I consider this home. I am not going to leave, I am going to stay here, I am not going to shut up, I am going to speak up," Hicks said Wednesday, adding that she posted the video to Facebook to raise awareness. "I have seen a lot of these incidents lately, I believe ever since the Trump administration came into power, he can say hateful things to other races and other countries, these people think it's okay for them to do the same." In a statement posted online Walmart said it had "no tolerance for the language or actions" of the customer and commended the staff member seen in the video, saying he acted appropriately by asking the woman to leave. A Walmart spokesperson told CNN on Wednesday that they were working to identify the woman and "once identified we will ask she no longer shops at our stores." Hicks said she hopes to meet the woman who came to her defense and was subsequently called the N-word. "I don't know her, I am supposed to meet her today," she said. "I want to meet her to say thank you and just give her a hug." TM & © 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Varsani and Iyer will work under Albertsons’ SVP of digital marketing and e-commerce, Narayan Iyengar, who joined the company in January with a goal of expanding e-commerce to several new markets this year. Varsani, who helped develop macys.com into one of the largest e-commerce sites in the U.S., joins Albertsons as group VP of digital product management. In this role Varsani will have responsibility for the digital experience — web, app and in-store — for all brands and locations. He is a customer experience leader with 16 years of practice in the digital retail and technology industries, most recently with Macy’s, where he was group VP of product management, strategy and experience. Iyer, a former VP of e-commerce at Levi Strauss & Co., has joined Albertsons as the group VP of IT, digital and marketing/merchandising. She has a deep understanding of how digital technology is changing consumers' shopping behavior, and brings a unique combination of retail, technology and global leadership experience, the company said. Prior to her tenure as the VP of e-commerce at Levi's, she held various IT leadership roles at Walmart.com and SamsClub.com. "After being relatively unaffected by digital for many years, the grocery industry is starting to see several parts of the customer journey being transformed by digital. In this context, we need to continue to enhance our digital capabilities, and Karl and Ramiya will play a key role in this journey," Iyengar said in a statement. "The addition of these leaders with diverse and rich retail experiences will position us to accelerate our efforts to having a differentiated digital experience for our customers," added Anuj Dhanda, EVP and CIO.

(AP Photo/Robert F. Bukaty, File) NEW YORK — A proposal to curtail the nation's food stamp program would pinch families struggling to pay for groceries and ripple through other areas of the economy, including supermarkets and discounters, as people shuffle their budgets. President Donald Trump is proposing a roughly 30 per cent reduction in the federal budget for the program formally known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. His overall budget proposal met a chilly reception from lawmakers, and is unlikely to be passed as is. But it suggests increasing work requirements for SNAP recipients, and says states should both share in the cost of the program and determine the level of benefits they provide. That would lead to fewer people in the program, or could reduce how much help they get. Last year, more than 44 million people received an average of about $125 a month in SNAP benefits, totalling about $66.6 billion, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. How any cuts would play out across industries would depend on how people adjust to pay for food, how reliant a retailer is on SNAP spending and other factors. Here's a look at what we know. WHO USES SNAP, AND WHERE ARE THEY SHOPPING? SNAP households are already on extremely tight budgets. To qualify, a family of four's take-home pay can be no more than $2,025 a month, while a two-person household can earn no more than $1,335. More than 260,000 locations were authorized to accept SNAP credits last year. Superstores such as Wal-Mart and Target got 52 per cent of redemptions, supermarkets like Kroger got 30 per cent, and convenience stores got about 6 per cent, according to the USDA . The rest was split among other kinds of stores. The USDA doesn't specify how much is spent at specific retailers. But in 2013, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. told the Wall Street Journal that it gets about 18 per cent of total SNAP benefits. That would have been about $13.43 billion in 2012. WHAT HAPPENED WITH PREVIOUS SNAP CUTS? It's complicated. Since food is a fixed cost, retailers have said that people used money intended for other purposes to pay for groceries after a recent pullback in the program. "They're paying cash or on a credit card if they didn't have the food stamps. And then they will give up on something else," Kroger's CEO at the time, Dave Dillon, said in December 2013. That was after the SNAP benefits that were expanded during the recession returned to their previous levels. But how companies are affected can vary and it's difficult to pinpoint the impact of any one change on sales, which can be affected by weather, competitive pressure and other factors. After the 2013 rollback in benefits, Wal-Mart blamed a 0.4 per cent quarterly sales decline on the reduction, though the sales figure was down for the company's entire fiscal year. Last year, the SNAP program also underwent cuts when 22 states reinstated a three-month limit on benefits for unemployed adults who aren't disabled or raising children and don't meet certain work requirements. That limitation had been waived by some states during the recession. Dollar General, which has said it gets about 5 per cent of its sales from SNAP benefits, compared the impact of the reduction last year to what happened in 2013. "Our traffic slowed tremendously then, very similar to as it did now," Dollar General CEO Todd Vasos said last summer. WHAT CHANGES FOR RETAILERS? Trump's proposal suggests that retailers pay a fee for authorization to accept food stamps. Companies currently don't pay to participate, which the proposal says fails to recognize "the significant portion of a retailer's revenue that SNAP can represent." The proposed budget estimates the fees would raise about $2.4 billion over 10 years. It doesn't spell out how the fee would be calculated. Imposing a fee could result in smaller stores or chains deciding not to seek authorization, said Craig Gundersen, a professor of agricultural economics at the University of Illinois who has received financial support from the Walmart Foundation and grants from the agency that administers the food stamp program. That would reduce the number of places where people who use SNAP could get groceries. The National Grocers Association said the fee proposal "raised a red flag." It otherwise declined to comment on how its members might be affected by the proposed changes, but said the SNAP program plays "an important role in providing a safety net to those in need." HOW DO SNAP CUTS AFFECT THE LARGER ECONOMY? The government's overall SNAP spending declines when the economy improves and fewer people rely on the program. It's a situation that is the "best possible outcome," said Stacy Dean, vice-president of food assistance policy at the liberal-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Dean said cutting benefits when people's financial situations are not improving could mean they use money they otherwise would have spent on needs like clothing or even medicine to make up for the gaps in their food budget. So there's still an impact to the overall economy, she said. Putting off other purchases could affect other departments at superstores or separate retailers. A report by the USDA in 2010 also said that boosting SNAP benefits during economic downturns starts a "multiplier process" in transactions and consumption. It found that boosting SNAP expenditures by $1 billion was estimated to increase economic activity by $1.79 billion. Trump's proposal could have more significant effects than the rollbacks in 2013 and last year, said Gundersen. He said shifting costs partially to states would be unprecedented and likely lead to cutbacks. That's because states may decide they can't afford to fund benefits during tough economic times, or cut benefits for other reasons. Maine Gov. Paul LePage has asked to ban the purchase of candy and soda with food stamps. LePage has expressed optimism that his push could gain traction under Trump's administration. ___ Follow Candice Choi at www.twitter.com/candicechoi       E-mail this Article Print this Article Share this Article           Story Tools   E-mail this Article Print this Article Share this Article   Font: * * * * *   Image: * * * *       FILE - In this Friday, March 17, 2017, file photo, a sign advertises a program that allows food stamp recipients to use their EBT cards to shop at a farmer's market in Topsham, Maine.

Dubai and India are already implementing blockchain programs to help reduce fraud, slash bureaucratic paperwork and streamline public records by 2020. Now, some experts are speculating about blockchain's ability help protect the environment. “The time is ripe for ‘cryptogovernance,’ in which trust, law and enforcement are outsourced to computer code,” Swedish ecologist Guillaume Chapron wrote for Nature. “For sustainability, blockchain technology could be a game-changer.” There are five main ways blockchain technology could help protect the environment: increasing accountability and transparency, automating economic incentives for eco-friendly practices and reducing waste.   Read: How Women Are Building The Future And Promoting Diversity With Blockchain Several companies are already using blockchain to streamline global supply chains. The New York Times reported Walmart is using IBM blockchain technology to track Chinese pork shipments. From an enterprise perspective, Walmart is interested in avoiding lost or spoiled shipments. With a little nudge from regulators and consumers, the same systems could monitor eco-friendly business practices and offer consumers a detailed history of each product. In January, the San Francisco-based company Chronicled Inc. launched its mobile app Discover, which uses chips to QR codes to identify everyday objects and creates a simple display of the item’s entire history. Simplicity is crucial here. Who has time and expertise to judge every product’s environmental impact on a daily basis? On a wider scale, regulatory bodies could use blockchain to track corporate behavior and automate cryptocurrency incentives. “The overall environmental impact of firms or consumers could be recorded on the blockchain and sustainable behavior rewarded through incentives such as tax rebates,” Chapron wrote. Unlike human regulators, blockchain oversight would be hard to compromise. “Basically, all a blockchain does is assign any piece of information a unique signature,” Wired reported. “If someone alters that information, that unique code no longer works, and you know something fishy is afoot.” United Nations blockchain pilot programs for distributing humanitarian aid in Jordan and Pakistan show the same principle could be applied directly to funds. “The blockchain could ensure that conservation and development funding is used as intended,” Chapron wrote. “Money can be tracked, attached to a specific purpose, have an expiry date or be released when project milestones are met.” The fintech startup Ripple has already developed blockchain-inspired payment systems along these lines. Its banking solutions are able to automate quick payments that only release after certain tasks are completed. Right now Ripple sells these services to banks and corporate clients. But the same concept could be applied beyond the private sector. The emerging technology behind these types of smart contracts could help decentralize political power. “The decisions being made by developers now have moral consequences and will define the space,” blockchain expert and venture capitalist Alyse Killeen told International Business Times about cryptographic regulation. “You can’t compete as a centralized entity against a distributed network.” Fellow investor and blockchain expert Bruce Fenton trusts blockchain systems to monitor transactions more fairly than human regulators or policymakers. “You don’t want powerful people in this space,” Fenton told IBT. “Code is what matters now.” Read: From Swell to Grow, These Startups Are All About Social Impact Capitalism Meanwhile, energy companies like Electron in the United Kingdom and the Singapore Power Group have started using blockchain to reduce waste. Blockchain is great at not only recording energy flow. It can also pinpoint areas where distribution or storage could be more efficient. “The idea that you have all these connected devices able to talk to each other and optimize their consumption without going through any central hub means that you can now optimize pockets and smaller areas of grid and energy usage,” Electron co-founder Joanna Hubbard told Ensia. Blockchain technology can also help identify areas where other power sources could be easily integrated into the system, which is a huge challenge for energy companies looking to increase dependence on renewable energy without costly rebuilding efforts. Cryptocoinsnews reported Singapore’s experiment could reduce costs and increase “efficient integration of renewable energy sources onto the country’s electricity grid.” However, although the Environmental Defense Fund described blockchain as a “disruptive technology” offering new possibilities for clean energy, all this potential still lives in the realm of ideas. Right now, financial institutions and private companies are the dominant players creating new blockchain solutions. It would take a concentrated effort from eco-conscious organizations to develop these ideas into high-tech tools for the real world.      Join the Discussion Most Read The Newsletter Exclusive articles delivered to your inbox daily.

After years of scrutiny, a midseason rebirth and an amazing postseason Jake “the Snake” Allen has finally proven himself to the St. Louis fanbase. Blues Beginnings It was one of the worst times in franchise history. After the 2004 NHL lockout canceled season, the Blues would post the NHL’s worst record and fail to reach the postseason for the first time in 25 years. Questionable management decisions and unenthusiastic ownership led to an uninterested fan base and empty arenas. It wasn’t until Wal-Mart heir Nancy Walton-Laurie and her husband Bill sold the team in March 2006 that things would begin to change. New ownership immediately shook up the front office and the new regime began to revamp the roster. The Blues would go on to miss the playoffs for four straight seasons but in the process, they would begin to stockpile draft picks and promising young talent. When the Blues drafted Allen in 2008, goaltending duties were being split by 35-year-old Manny Legace and 32-year-old Chris Mason. Even though young prospect Ben Bishop had made his first NHL appearance in the same season, drafting Allen made sense as the Blues desperately needed goaltending depth. Bishop was drafted by the Blues in the third round, 85th overall, of the 2005 NHL Entry Draft,(Icon SMI) A less than promising goaltending core went through major changes following the 2009 season. Legace was released after being sent down to then American Hockey League affiliate Peoria, then in the summer of 2010 the Blues traded for Montreal Canadians playoff hero Jaroslav Halak. In July 2011 they signed eventual Blues’ fan favorite Brian Elliot to form the best goaltending duo of the 2011-12 season, winning the William M. Jennings Trophy. That postseason, Elliot would replace the injured Halak to lead the Blues to a series victory over the San Jose Sharks. The success of Halak and Elliot allowed the Blues to trade Bishop for a second round pick in the 2013 NHL Draft. The trade made way for a young Allen who had been buying his time with Peoria, posting nine shutouts in the process. Allen played 15 games in the lockout-shortened 2012-13 season alongside Elliot after Halak went down with an injury. In the playoffs, the Blues went home early, as they were eliminated for the second straight season by the Los Angeles Kings but this time, in the first round. Back to the AHL After being called up to finish the 2012 season, Jake Allen began the 2013-14 season with the Blues AHL affiliate Chicago. The Blues would eclipse the 100-point mark for the sixth time in franchise history finishing third in the Western Conference. At the trade deadline, general manager Doug Armstrong may have pulled the trigger on the worst trade in franchise history (besides maybe the Mike Keenan debacle). The Blues traded Halak, forward Chris Stewart, and two 2015 draft picks to the Buffalo Sabres for goaltender Ryan Miller and then team captain Steve Ott. Armstrong made the move in hopes to sure up their goaltending to get over the hump in the postseason. The trade became a complete failure and the Blues went on to lose in the first round to the Chicago Blackhawks in the exact same way that they had lost to the Kings the year before, literally.   Blues 2013 and 2014 playoff series summaries (via Nick Olson) Meanwhile, Allen would unanimously win the Aldege “Baz” Bastien Memorial Award as the AHL’s outstanding goaltender for the 2013-14 season finishing the season with a 33-16-3 record, 2.03 goals-against average, a .928 save percentage, and a league-leading seven shutouts. Allen was phenomenal for the Wolves leading them to an AHL 2nd best 100 points and a second place western conference finish.

However, Chicago’s great season would come to an end in the conference semifinals as they were swept by the Toronto Marlies 4-0. The Final Call up On May 19, 2014, the Blues decided they had seen all they needed to see with the aging Miller and announced that he would no longer be with the team after just 25 games in a blue and gold sweater. Subsequently, general manager Doug Armstrong re-signed Brian Elliot to a three-year, $7.5 million contract extension. Miller’s departure secured an NHL roster spot for Allen, and the call up would be his last. Alongside Elliot, the young netminder played 37 games, posting an impressive 22-7-4 record, 2.28 goals against average, and a .913 save percentage. Behind stellar defense and goaltending the Blues allowed the fourth fewest goals in the NHL. Vladimir Tarasenko’s breakout 73-point season helped them score the fifth most goals and the Blues would win their second straight Central Division title. Vladimir Tarasenko and Jake Allen celebrate a victory in 2014, (Jasen Vinlove-USA TODAY Sports) On November 25, 2014, Elliot injured his knee in a game against the Ottawa Senators. Without taking any chances headed toward the postseason the Blues would bring in arguably the greatest goaltender that has ever played in Martin Brodeur. The former New Jersey Devil signed a one-year contract worth $700,000. Brodeur played in seven games while filling in for Elliot, winning three. He was able to add another shutout to his resume, giving him an NHL record 125 in his 21-year career. After Elliot returned, Brodeur took a leave of absence and a few days later abruptly retired to join the Blues front office. Allen would get his chance to shine as he would be named the starter for the first time in the postseason, but it was a familiar fate for the Blues. They would lose in six games to the Minnesota Wild in the first round. An Amazing Season Spoiled During the following offseason, the Blues traded away shootout specialist T.J. Oshie to the Washington Capitals for veteran Troy Brouwer, goaltender Pheonix Copley and a third-round draft pick in the 2016 NHL draft. The move left many scratching their heads, but similarly to this season’s Kevin Shattenkirk move, the Blues didn’t skip a beat. Allen would play in 10 more games than the 2014 season and continued to look the part of the team’s goaltender of the future. Posting a record of 26-15-3, a solid 2.35 goals-against average, and a .920 save percentage. The Blues would finish 2nd in the Central and match up with division rival Chicago. Heading into the postseason Blues fans were so happy with their goaltending that they had started comparing the duo of Allen and Elliot to the tandem of Jacques Plante and Glenn Hall, Hall of Famers that led the 1968-69 Blues to the Stanley Cup Finals. Jacques Plante and Glenn Hall shared the 1969 Vezina Trophy. Behind Elliot, the Blues ended their first round struggles and defeated the Chicago Blackhawks in seven games. In the 2nd round, Allen would get his first postseason action in game 6. After three quick goals in the first period, Elliot was pulled in favor of Allen, who went on to stop all seven shots he faced in the remaining two periods. However, Elliot redeemed himself in a 6-1 Blues victory in Game 7. St. Louis would make the conference finals for the first time in 15 seasons but failed to culminate one of their best seasons in franchise history. Head coach Ken Hitchcock decided to start Allen for Game 4 after a stinker from Elliot in Game 3. Allen allowed three goals but the Blues would get the 6-3 victory. Allen would get the nod in the following game and produce a stinker of his own giving up four goals in a reverse 6-3 loss.  The Sharks defeated the Blues in six games to put an end to their season. Blues fans were tough on Hitchcock for yanking Elliot in the series, and some blamed the loss on the move. Trading a Moose Solidifies Faith in a Snake After the Western Conference Finals loss and Allen’s struggles in 2015 against Minnesota, the Blues’ fan base could only wonder if Allen was a guy who couldn’t perform when it mattered most. St. Louis had watched 49 years of hockey without a Stanley Cup and the latest scapegoat for many was Allen. Blues brass proved that they didn’t feel the same about Allen. On June 24, 2016, St. Louis traded the man the fans call Moose to Calgary in exchange for the 35th overall pick in 2016 (became Jordan Kyrou) and a conditional third round pick in 2018. The move meant that it was now the Jake “The Snake” Allen show in St. Louis. Salt was poured into the wound of a bitter fan base that lost two of their favorite players when they let team captain David Backes leave for Boston. Jake Allen (John E. Sokolowski-USA TODAY Sports) The Snake took the Blues on a roller coaster ride throughout the 2016 season. He started off the season with a 4-1-2 record, a .923 save percentage, and a 1.83 goals-against average, but as each month progressed Allen got worse. By December, he told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch he was “pretty pissed off” that his save percentage had dipped to .905, 25th in the NHL. On January 19, Allen allowed four goals on 10 shots against the Washington Capitals and was pulled not once in the game but twice. Allen was yanked four times in six outings. He was playing so poorly that the Blues decided to leave him home on their following road trip, starting career backup Carter Hutton. Jake Allen 2016 Monthly Splits, (via Nick Olson) The team continued to struggle and after losing five of six games to the tune of a underwhelming 24-21-5 record, the Blues fired Hitchcock and propelled his hand-picked successor Mike Yeo into the head coaching position, a move that would save the Blues season and quite possibly Allen’s career. Enter Marty Brodeur Not only did the Blues fire Hitchcock, they also sent goalie coach Jim Corsi packing. The man that smoothed things over for the Blues to end the 2014-15 season would be called upon again to do the same in 2016. Brodeur was given full control of the goaltending schedule and began to work one on one with Allen. Embed from Getty Images Brodeur noticed that Allen’s biggest issues were basic fundamentals. Things like keeping the puck in the center of the chest, motion in his skating during a rush, and keeping himself square to the puck. Allen’s season immediately rebounded and a month later Allen carried a .941 save percentage and a 1.80 goals against average, the best in the NHL over that span. The Blues won seven of their first eight games under Yeo, the best of any Blues’ coach debut in franchise history. They went from 28th to first in goals against per game and finished with a 21-8-2 record, and finished as one of the hottest teams in the NHL going 7-1-2 in their final 10 games. The Snake Proves he can Perform Under Pressure Undoubtedly, the biggest storyline of the first round was Allen’s amazing play. His 51 saves in Game 1 led the Blues to an overtime win and by the end of Game 3 Allen had saved 114 of 117 shots in the series. The Blues would advance in five games and Allen silenced any of the remaining doubters proving he could lead a team to a postseason series victory. The Blues would run into a golden buzzsaw in the name of the Nashville Predators in the second round. Allen continued his stellar play but the goaltender on the other end of the ice, Pekka Rinne was just as good. Penalties would prove to be St. Louis’ kryptonite in the series and the drama-filled 2016-17 season would come to an end. A Bright Future As frustrating as another early postseason departure is for the Blues, the future looks bright. They now have a solidified, proven number one goaltender that has the capability to carry a team through a postseason series. You have to look at the adversity that Allen overcame this season and how he was able to not only return to form but regain confidence in himself. Allen and the Blues do owe a lot to Brodeur but at the end of the day it was not the four-time Vezina winner making the saves, it was Allen. The Blues will have a full offseason with Yeo at the helm, they have promising young talent in the farm system and guys like Robbi Fabbri, Ivan Barbashev, Zach Sanford and Joel Edmundson will have another year under their belt. There is a chance backup goaltender Carter Hutton is chosen in the NHL expansion draft but every other major piece of the Blues puzzle is safe going forward. Allen has finally proven himself to the St. Louis fanbase. Every goaltending transaction that has taken place in the last 10 years (besides Miller) is now reinforced as the correct moves. Not Bishop, not Halak, not Elliot, but Jake “The Snake” Allen could be the goaltender the Blues need to give the city of St. Louis a Stanley Cup championship. 56SHARES ShareTweetLinkedin RedditMail Tags Brian Elliott Jake Allen Martin Brodeur Top Story We’re Growing!

A white woman inside the store got into a verbal altercation with a Latina woman and then dropped the N-word when a Black woman stepped in to calm things down. In a cellphone video, a woman can be heard telling the angry white lady “I said excuse me” which got the racist response of “Go back to Mexico” while waving her off. The white woman tried to give the woman a lesson on being in America or some other such nonsense, all the while the other woman filming the exchange has tried being polite as possible. When a Black woman came over to help, she got blessed with the slur treatment but amazingly kept her composure. The fact that racist little white lady didn’t walk out of that Walmart with the most epic of fades and tapers is a miracle.

For example, buying the “cheapest” small appliances usually means having to buy them again in a few short years. Ask me how many times I purchased a $17 coffeemaker from Walmart to figure that one out. The same can be said for clothes. I don’t know how many cheap new outfits I bought from Kohl’s before I finally had enough. Even though I never spent very much at once, I got sick of buying shirts and pants that deteriorated or faded within months. My Love Affair with Soma These days, I typically pay a little more for items that have the potential to last longer. And when it comes to clothes, I usually shop for my favorite brands secondhand. Usually. But, when a friend introduced me to Soma Intimates (they also sell lounge wear and dresses) a few years ago, I instantly fell in love. The great news about Soma is that the clothing barely fades and always holds it shape. I have a bunch of Soma dresses that I wear all spring, summer, and fall – but you could never tell. They don’t wrinkle and they don’t look rundown when you wear them a lot. Many of their dresses have pockets and built-in bras as well, making them the most practical and comfortable pieces of clothing I own. The bad news about Soma is the problem you find with most high-quality clothing: It’s expensive. One of their maxi dresses (my favorite) can cost $90 or more, and their knee-length dresses are usually at least $60. That’s a lot more than I want to pay for anything – let alone clothes. Yet, Soma clothes last so long, I don’t want to buy anything else. Related: Avoiding Fashion Trends May Be the Hottest Look of 2017 Save Money on Your Favorite Clothing Brand with Poshmark Fortunately, I ran into a new way to buy my favorite clothing brand at a discount – and from the comfort of my own home. After looking for Soma dresses on eBay one day, I ran into Poshmark.com. Poshmark is a secondhand retail marketplace where people focus most of their efforts on high-end clothing brands. On any given day, people are buying and selling clothes and accessories from brands like Michael Kors, Louis Vuitton, Gucci, and yes, Soma. Since prices are set by sellers, there’s no rhyme or reason to how much you can save. Still, there are serious bargains to be had if you prefer to buy specific brands and know exactly what you want. For example, I’ve scored several of those long Soma maxi-dresses, that are usually $90, for just $15 each plus shipping. I’ve also found and ordered some shorter Soma dresses and cardigans for $8 to $15. Since my kids look good in almost anything and fit easily into their size, I’ve ordered numerous dresses, shirts, and pants for them at $5 to $10 apiece. This is a lot more than I would pay for their clothes at a garage sale, so I only order them dressy and “nicer” stuff – like the dresses we used in our recent family pictures. When it comes to play clothes, I’ll stick to the 50-cent and $1 pieces I pick up at secondhand stores or summer yard sales. In one of our recent family photos, all three girls are in secondhand clothes from Poshmark. Poshmark Isn’t Perfect While Poshmark offers an exceptional opportunity to save money on clothing brands you love, there are some downsides. For starters, you do have to pay shipping on your purchases – and that shipping can add up fast. As of 2017, standard priority shipping on items up to 5 lbs. is $6.49. So if you buy a Soma dress for $20, the total price you’ll pay is $26.49. You can save on shipping by buying multiple products from a single seller and “bundling” for a lower total shipping cost, but that doesn’t always make sense. If you’re buying stuff you don’t really want just to save on shipping, you’re not really saving money, right? Another downside that comes with “poshing” is that you don’t have the opportunity to try things on. If you fork over $20 to $30 for a dress and it doesn’t fit, you won’t recoup your costs until you resell it. Further, some of the sellers on Poshmark are completely unrealistic when it comes to pricing their used items; a small percentage of sellers try to charge way too much. Before you buy anything on Poshmark, make sure you know the retail value of the item first. The bottom line: Not everything you see on Poshmark is drastically discounted or even a good deal. Five Tips to Make the Most of Poshmark Even with those downsides in mind, it’s possible to save money on higher-quality clothing brands you love. Here are five tips that can help you get the most out of Poshmark: #1: Only buy clothing brands you already know and love. Since you don’t have the opportunity to try on clothing ahead of time, Poshmark.com is a terrible place to experiment with your wardrobe. If you buy clothing you’re not sure you’ll like, you could easily wind up overspending on clothing you won’t wear. The best Poshmark strategy is one where you’re looking for a specific brand you’re already familiar with and loyal to. For me, that brand is Soma because their clothing always fits and I already know my size. For you, it could be anything – the perfect size and brand of shoes, or your favorite brand of swimsuit. Since my husband only fits into a few brands of jeans, I keep an eye out for those on the site, too. #2: If something costs more than you want to pay, you can bid a lower price. One Poshmark feature I love is their “bidding” feature. If you don’t like the asking price, you can bid anything you want instead. My bidding success rate is around 50%. Some sellers are quick to accept your offer, while others want their asking price no matter what. And if you’re embarrassed to bid, don’t be. Shopping on Poshmark is a lot like anything else in life – you’ll never know if you can get a better deal unless you ask. And if your bid is rejected, you can always bid again. #3: Don’t forget about shipping. Since Poshmark purchases are made through individual sellers, shipping costs can be a bear. Paying for shipping doesn’t automatically make your purchase a bad deal, but you do have to keep that extra $6.49 per purchase in mind. Before you bid on something or buy it at its current asking price, make sure to mentally account for shipping. If you were okay paying $20 for a dress but think $26.49 is too much, you should definitely put in a lower bid or pass. Don’t forget to add $6.49 to everything you buy… #4: Watch out for fakes. Just like eBay or even consignment shops, Poshmark has its share of sellers who try to pass off fakes for the real thing. Fakes aren’t limited to clothing and shoes, either; you can find fake Gucci sunglasses just as easily as you can find counterfeit shirts and pants. If you’re worried something is fake, you can message the seller directly and ask. And if they lie, you’re still covered. A feature called Poshmark Protect ensures your funds aren’t released to a seller until your item shows up at your home in good condition. If your item never arrives or it’s not as described, you can reject it. Here’s how Poshmark’s policy works according to their FAQ’s: “When you make a purchase on Poshmark, we don’t release payment to the seller until you tell us you’ve received your order as described. You have 3 days after delivery to inform us if the item has been misrepresented by reporting the problem in the Poshmark app or website with supporting photos. If we verify your claim, we’ll send you a label to return the order to the seller and refund your payment. All returns must be shipped back within 5 days of approval to be eligible for a refund.” #5: Only bundle clothing when it makes sense. While you can save on shipping and occasionally score a discount by buying more than one item from a single seller, you should proceed with caution. Buying more stuff to save more money is rarely the best idea. If your goal is saving money, you should strive to buy only what you need while paying as little as you can get away with. Bundling with Poshmark rarely works out in your favor; it helps sellers move more product, but it doesn’t really help you save. Final Thoughts If you’re tired of paying for clothing that falls apart, sticking to higher-quality brands can help. And the best way to avoid the quality markup, you’ll need to shop secondhand. While I love consignment shops and adore garage sales, it’s really hit or miss when it comes to the type of clothing I prefer to wear. And that’s why I keep coming back to Poshmark again and again; if I’m flexible and patient, I can usually find exactly what I want for around ¼ the price. While I typically pay more through Poshmark than I would at a garage sale, I don’t have to drive around aimlessly or dig through piles of clothes, either. If your goal is saving money and having a wardrobe that stands the test of time, it doesn’t get any better than that.

(AP) " Wal-Mart Stores Inc. announced Tuesday that it's expanding its military leave-of-absence policy by offering differential pay to all eligible employees who are on military assignments lasting more than three days. The Bentonville, Arkansas-based company said in a news release that the differential pay will cover the duration of military leave, including basic training, for employees whose military salary is less than what they earn working for Wal-Mart. The company says its employees took more than 4,400 military leave of absences last year. The new policy takes effect June 24. Wal-Mart senior director for military programs, retired Brig. Gen. Gary Profit, said employees who want to serve in the military will now be able to do so more easily. "We believe that anyone who wants to serve in our Armed Forces should be able to do so without fear of losing wages or leaving their family in a lurch." Profit said. "The changes we're making will remove financial barriers for all associates serving their country, including those who are starting their service journey through basic training." Wal-Mart also announced that it was giving a $100,000 grant to the Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors, a group that helps those grieving the death of a loved one who served in the Armed Forces.

There is a Swagbucks Swag Code Extravaganza today, May 24, with new codes released all day long! Code #6 The 6th and last code for the day will be available today from 8 pm to 9 pm. Check the Comments section of this post shortly after 8 pm to get the code. Enter the code in the Swag Code box at Swagbucks.com HERE. There will be 6 codes during the day worth a total of 40 SB points! I'll post the codes here and on the WRAL Smart Shopper Facebook Page. New to Swagbucks? If you don't know about Swagbucks yet, it's the largest rewards website that gives people free gift cards for the things they do online (searching, shopping, watching videos, playing games and more). You earn points called SB for online activities and then you can cash them in for gift cards to places like Amazon, Target, Walmart, CVS, Lowes, Starbucks, Paypal, Bass Pro Shops, Kohl's and so many more! It's free to join and I have earned a bunch of gift cards in the many years I have been a member. Look below for a bonus sign up code! How do you get these SB points? There are lots of ways. * Search online: Each time you need to search for something online, use the Swagbucks search engine on their website (instead of Google). I actually have the Swagbucks toolbar installed on my desktop and it places a search box right on my screen making it super easy to search. Every once in a while, they award SB points just for doing the searches I used to do using Google. * Take surveys on their website * Answer the daily poll * Watch videos through their website or multiple mobile apps (I earn about 80 - 100 SB a day doing this) * Use their online shopping portal (I do most of my online shopping at major retailers who are part of the Swagbucks Shop and Earn program (like Amazon.com, Kohls.com, Walmart.com and more) and earn Swagbucks every time I shop. Just this week, I was credited with 562 SB points (worth $5.62 in gift cards) for an online purchase I made a few weeks ago. * Play games * Participate in special Swag Code events * Enter the daily Swag Code (which we usually let you know about here on the blog each day). Swagbucks posts bonus codes on their Facebook, Twitter and blog pages each day. If you have the Swagbucks Mobile App, it will buzz when there is a new code. When the code becomes available each day, one of us posts it here on the blog so we can all get it. The codes are only valid for an hour usually. Once you get the code, you then copy and paste the code into the Swag Code box at the top of the homepage of Swagbucks.com. Look for the circle with the words Swag Code next to it. New member bonus Swagbucks sign-up code! As I posted above, new members get a 70 SB bonus when you sign up HERE. To get the bonus SB points, click the text that reads "I have a sign up code" during registration and then enter the code: SMARTSHOPPER to get the bonus. Make sure you use all caps since it is case sensitive. This post contains affiliate links and I appreciate your using them!

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: A Double Dose of Good News From Brick-and-Mortar Retail Wal-Mart and Target both delivered profit beats in the first quarter. Motley Fool Staff (the_motley_fool) May 24, 2017 at 6:46AM In this segment from the Motley Fool Money radio show, host Chris Hill, Million Dollar Portfolio's Jason Moser and Matt Argersinger, and Motley Fool Total Income's Ron Gross talk about the good news in traditional retail: Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) and Target (NYSE:TGT) are doing better than expected. Of course, Wal-Mart still has a big challenge ahead to compete in e-commerce, and Target is attacking its problems on a host of fronts all at once. So what does the future hold for these players -- and the sector in general? A full transcript follows the video. This video was recorded on May 19, 2017. Chris Hill: We begin with signs of life in the general retail sector. Wal-Mart's first quarter profit came in higher than expected, as did Target's, overall a better picture than we were talking about a week ago with Macy's, Kohl's, etc. Before we go big picture, Matty, this is a good quarter for Wal-Mart. Matt Argersinger: Wal-Mart, I guess the headline there is the 63% increase in online sales, which was a big acceleration. They were doing, at this time last year, single digits. So, they've obviously ramped that business pretty well. I think you have to put it in perspective, though. Wal-Mart doesn't break out e-commerce revenue as a percentage, or even the actual number. But, according to eMarketer, their sales last year online were $14.4 billion. So, if you expect that 2017 will be a great year, maybe they grow that business 50%, they'll get to over $20 billion. Just to put that in context, though, Amazon's online sales, stripping out web services and international, just North American online sales, they're going to do about $100 billion this year. Hill: So Wal-Mart is planning to catch up. Argersinger: They're second, but it's a distant second. So, when I balance that against total revenue increase of 1.4%, comps that were up only 1.4%, it's going to take a lot for that business to really move the needle for Wal-Mart. It's still very early. Hill: Ron, Target's same-store sales fell a little bit, but as management said, it's a very choppy environment out there. Ron Gross: I love that. I saw one analyst call it "less bad." Hill: You know what? Given what we talked about at the beginning of last week's show, less bad is pretty darn good. Gross: As Matty said, digital channel sales, we saw an increase, 22% is a good number. Up 22%, but still only 4.3% of total revenue. It continues to be a struggle. They're going to invest $7 billion over the next few years into redesigning stores and lowering some prices and opening 100 smaller locations, it seems that's kind of the thing that everyone is trying to do now, in urban centers, college campus areas. They're trying to encourage shoppers to make bigger purchases, which is, they're copying what Amazon does with the Pantry, where you can pay one price and fill a box with stuff and ship it to you at a flat fee. They're trying to copy that a bit. So, everything was OK. You have negative same-store sales, but only slightly, so I guess that's fine. Guidance was not terrible, so we'll call it somewhat encouraging. But they have a lot of work to do, and they acknowledged that much, they said specifically that things are not where they want them to be. Jason Moser: This week in adjectives, right? It was less bad, somewhat encouraging, OK. Hill: Well, Jason, the point that Ron made last week, where he said, look at all these retailers, the fact is, some of them are going to be going out of business at some point. But you look at Target, you look at Wal-Mart. These are the two biggest bricks-and-mortar general retailers in the United States, and I feel like they are staking their claim, saying, "We're not going anywhere." Moser: Sure. I think I was over picking up dinner last night from Chipotle, of all places, we were supporting the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, and I saw a store, it was RadioShack, right by there, going out of sales, entire store is on sale. I felt like a deja-vu, haven't we gone through that once before? Target and Wal-Mart are a bit different animals. I do think there's a place in this world for them, Wal-Mart particularly. There is a physical footprint there that you can't discount, and retail is ultimately about logistics. And in today's world, I think it's becoming more so, that's why Amazon has done so well. I think for Wal-Mart, the real opportunity on the investing side is for them to figure out a way to return more capital to shareholders. We were talking about this yesterday on Market Foolery. When you look at the repurchases, for example, Wal-Mart has repurchased and brought down their share count about 8% over the past five years. You compare that to Apple, Apple has brought their share count down more than 20%. That is a tech company, that's material. So, I think there's an opportunity there for Wal-Mart. And certainly also on the dividend side as well, the yield is under 3% still. By the same token, I think, based on what Matty was saying there, it seems like they're going to continue investing in this e-commerce opportunity for some time, which is probably the right move. But again, from an investing perspective, the bigger opportunity is to get a little bit better about returning capital to shareholders. Argersinger: Yeah, I can't help but think it's just too little too late for Wal-Mart and Target in online. But actually, I kind of hope they succeed, because the one big risk for Amazon now -- I think Amazon is going to the Moon, but the one risk is Amazon just gets too big, too influential, and some kind of regulatory antitrust actions start to come ahead to rumble. But if Wal-Mart has success online -- and Wal-Mart is already so huge, and already accounts for much more of total retail sales in the U.S. -- that makes me think that Amazon won't face any of those challenges, and Amazon can continue to grow, even if Wal-Mart and Target have some share of total online sales. Moser: The ultimate benefit of all of this, Amazon performing so well, is forcing everybody to up their game. And we're going to see some succeed there, and we're going to see some go away. I think Wal-Mart stands a chance of succeeding as good as anyone out there, if not more so, because they've had so much success to date, and they're so big already. Gross: When you say upping the game, for different retailers, that means different things. For some folks, that's shrinking the footprint and cutting costs to be profitable, but in a less grandiose kind of way. Target here is investing $7 billion to try to compete. There's a lot of risk in there. If you're throwing that amount of money to try to compete and you're wrong, look out below. Hill: And on the flip side, you look at Wal-Mart making that acquisition last year of Jet.com for $3 billion in change. I think some people raised an eyebrow at that price tag. But in the early earnings here, it appears to be paying off. Argersinger: Again, I feel like they had to do it, and the thing that Jet brought them was a lot of talent, talent and resources they didn't really have, or knowledge power. So, it's the right move, and sure enough, early on here, it seems to be paying off.

just-style home News & insights News US Q1 in brief – Tilly's, DSW, New York & Co, JC Penney By Michelle Russell and Beth Wright | 24 May 2017 Font size Email Print In the most recent first-quarter filings from US apparel and footwear brands and retailers, Walmart delivered an encouraging start to the year thanks to higher sales, while Ross Stores booked growth despite market volatility. Kate Spade, meanwhile, saw earnings slump on the back of sales declines, while Hudson's Bay recorded comparable store declines on the back of lower domestic store traffic across all banners.  Tilly's Apparel, footwear and accessories retailer Tilly's said its initiatives are gaining traction, as it narrowed its net loss to US$0.2m from $2.7m. Gross margin increased 10 basis points to 27.2% from 27.1% last year, primarily due to an 80 basis point reduction in buying, distribution and occupancy costs, offset by a 70 basis point decline in product margins from increased markdowns. Total sales edged up 0.6% to $120.9m, while comparable sales were also up by 0.6% compared to a 4.1% decline in the same period last year. DSW DWS said sales were challenging in the first quarter, but trends did improve with comps turning positive in April. For the thirteen weeks ended 29 April, net sales increased 1.4% to US$691.1m from $681.3m in the year-ago period, including $22.3m of revenues from Ebuys. Comparable sales decreased 3% compared to last year's 1.6% slip. Net income meanwhile, slipped to $23m compared to $30m last year. Gross margin decreased 180 bps to 28.2% from 30%, driven by planned clearance activity and the addition of Ebuys, offset by disciplined markdown management and favourable sourcing costs. CEO Roger Rawlins, said: "As expected, planned clearance activity and the addition of Ebuys drove lower gross margin and operating income. The investments we have made in our digital capabilities, such as our redesigned website and mobile app, drove robust growth in digital demand. We are intently focused on driving sequential top line improvements through key product and customer initiatives while balancing strategic investments with disciplined expense management." New York & Co New York & Co has booked first-quarter results in line with company expectations thanks to celebrity collaborations, a double-digit percentage increase in e-commerce sales and strong gross margin expansion to its highest level in the first quarter since 2008. Net losses narrowed to US$4.2m from $5.7m a year earlier, while gross margin improved 300 basis points to 30.7%. Net sales, however, dropped to $209.9m, a decline of 2.9% from $216m in the prior year, reflecting growth in e-commerce, offset by decreases in brick-and-mortar stores due to the combination of a lower store count (463 this year versus 488 last year) and a 0.7% drop in comparable store sales. JC Penney Retail giant JC Penney said it saw an improvement in women's apparel, despite widening its net loss to US$180m in the first quarter, compared to net loss of $68m in the year-ago period. For the three months ended 29 April, gross margin was up 10 basis points to 36.3 %, positively impacted by improved selling margins throughout the quarter, which was partially offset by the continued growth in the company's online and major appliance businesses. Net sales meanwhile, slipped 3.7% to $2.7bn from $2.8bn last year. Comparable store sales were down 3.5% for the quarter. CEO Marvin Ellison, said: "We continue to make encouraging progress in the company's competitive and financial position despite our top-line performance during the first quarter. While February was a very challenging month for JCPenney and broader retail, we are pleased with our comp store sales for the combined March and April period, which improved significantly versus February." Foot Locker US footwear retailer Foot Locker said its first-quarter was one of the company's most profitable in its history, despite a slip in net income and falling short of its original expectations. For the period ended 29 April, net income was US$180m, compared to $191m in the year-ago period. Total sales meanwhile, increased 0.7% to $2bn, compared with sales of $1.99bn for the corresponding prior-year period. Comparable-store sales were up 0.5%, while gross margin decreased to 34% from 35% a year ago. CEO Richard Johnson said: "The slow start we experienced in February, which we believe was largely due to the delay in income tax refunds, was unfortunately not fully offset by much stronger sales in March and April. Nonetheless, we believe our banners remain at the centre of a vibrant sneaker culture. We are confident that our customers have not lost their tremendous appetite for athletic footwear and apparel and that our position in the industry is stronger than ever." Cato Corp Cato Corp reported a fall in both sales and earnings for the first quarter, with net income slipping 38% to US$22.2m from $35.9m last year. First-quarter gross margin decreased 390 basis points to 38.7%, primarily due to lower merchandise margins and deleveraging of buying and occupancy costs. Meanwhile, total sales fell to $239.7m, compared to $288m in the year-ago period. Same-store sales were also down, slipping 17%. CEO John Cato said: ""Our negative sales trend persisted throughout the first quarter, impacting margins and earnings as we continued to work through our merchandise missteps," stated John Cato, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer. "It is taking longer to work through these issues than expected and the remainder of the year will be impacted. We expect earnings for the year to be below last year." The Buckle The Buckle booked a drop in both earnings and sales in the first quarter, with the former dropping to US$16.3m from $23.1m a year earlier. Revenues were down 12.8% to $212.3m from net sales of $243.5m for the year-ago period, while comparable sales fell 12.7%. Online sales were down 7.2% to $21.8m for the 13-week period ended 29 April. The Buckle also announced senior vice president of finance and CFO, Karen Rhoads,who joined the company in 1980, will retire later this summer. Rhoads will continue to serve as a member of the company's board of directors. The board has engaged an executive search firm to assist with the search for Rhoads' replacement. The Bon-Ton Stores US department store retailer The Bon-Ton Stores widened its net loss to US$57.3m in the first quarter, compared to $37.8m in the year-ago period. The York, Pennsylvania-based company saw total sales fall by 9.3% to $536.1m from $591m in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Comparable store sales decreased 8.8% as compared with the prior year period. Meanwhile, gross margin decreased 170 basis points to 32.2% compared to last year, primarily due to an increase in the markdown rate and increased delivery expenses. CEO Kathryn Bufano said: "Our first quarter results did not meet our expectations due primarily to weak mall traffic trends, unfavourable weather and marketing challenges associated with the Easter calendar shift." Ross Stores Ross Stores booker higher sales and earnings in its first-quarter despite uncertainty and volatility in the market. Earnings reached US$321m from $291m a year earlier. Total sales were up 7% to $3.3bn, while comparable store sales grew 3%. Operating margin of 15.2% exceeded company expectations due to above-plan sales and merchandise margin. For the second quarter, the company is forecasting same store sales to be up 1% to 2%, on top of a 4% gain last year, with earnings per share of $0.73 to $0.76, up from $0.71 in the prior year period. Stage Stores Stage Stores widened its net loss to US$19m from $15.5m in the first quarter as the company incurred after-tax charges primarily associated with the Gordmans acquisition of about $4m. Net sales were also down, falling 7.3% to $308.6m, compared to $332.8m in the prior year. Meanwhile, comparable sales decreased 9.6%. CEO Michael Glazer, noted: "After a challenging February in which we saw negative double digit comps, we began to gain momentum and our business improved significantly during the combined March and April period. While we expect retail headwinds to continue in the near term, we believe that our selective acquisition of prime Gordmans' assets allows us to diversify with an off-price business model. We expect the acquisition to add scale to our business and be meaningfully accretive to our earnings in 2018." Perry Ellis Perry Ellis said it was pleased with a "solid start" to fiscal 2018, with top and bottom line results surpassing guidance, reflecting solid growth in its core brands driven by the earlier shipment of Spring merchandise and strong gross margin expansion. For the three month period, as reported under GAAP, net income was US$12.8m, compared to GAAP net income of $14.3m last year. GAAP Gross margin expanded 120 basis points to 37.6%, while adjusted gross margin expanded 90 basis points. Meanwhile, total sales dropped 7.3% to $242m from $261m last year, but ahead of guidance of $230mto $235 million. The company said the decline reflected a planned decrease in shipments given a reduction of customers' doors and inventory discipline to drive higher margin sales. Walmart Walmart has delivered what analysts say is an encouraging start to the year as sales grew 1.4% in the quarter to US$117.5bn. Excluding currency, sales were up 2.5% to $118.8bn.

The Children's Place The Children's Place has booked what it says are "outstanding" operating results in the quarter with comparable sales, operating margin and earnings significantly above last year and the high end of its guidance. Net sales increased 4.1% to US$436.7m on the back of a comparable retail sales increased of 6.1%. Operating margin improved 170 basis points to 11.1%, while net income reached $36.2m from $26m a year earlier.

For the period ended 29 April, net income fell to US$25.2m from $40.5m last year.

Meanwhile, total net revenue was up 2% to $761.8m, compared to $749.4m in the year-ago period. Consolidated comparable sales were also up 2%, following a 6% increase last year. CEO Jay Schottenstein said: "The first quarter results reflected mall traffic headwinds, especially early in the quarter, with improved trends over Easter and a strong digital business throughout. As we look ahead, we are taking the right steps to improve our results and adjust our business for today's rapidly evolving retail environment." L Brands  L Brands booked a fall in both sales and earnings for the first quarter, with net income slipping to US$94.1m from $152.3m last year. For the three months ended 29 April, net sales fell 7% to $2.44bn compared to $2.61bn in the year-ago period. Comparable sales were also down, falling 9%. L Brands noted the exit of the swim and apparel categories had a negative impact of 6 percentage points and 9 percentage points to total company and Victoria's Secret comparable sales, respectively.

For the three months ended 29 April, sales slipped 1.1% to $16.0bn compared to $16.2bn last year, reflecting a comparable sales decline of 1.3%, partially offset by the contribution from new stores. Digital channel sales however increased, up by 22% and contributing 0.8 percentage points to comparable sales growth. Gross margin narrowed to 30.5%, compared with 30.9% in the year-ago period, reflecting increased digital channel fulfilment costs.  CEO Brian Cornell, said: "We are in the early stage of a multi-year effort to position Target for profitable, consistent long-term growth, and while we are confident in our plans, we are facing multiple headwinds in the current landscape. As a result, we will continue to plan our business prudently while preparing our team to chase business when we have an opportunity." Urban Outfitters Teen retailer Urban Outfitters saw net income slip 59.8% in the first quarter, falling to US$11.9m from $29.6m in the year-ago period.

By brand, comparable sales increased 1.5% at Free People, but decreased 3.1% at Urban Outfitters and 4.4% at the Anthropologie Group. The company said comparable sales were driven by strong, double-digit growth in the direct-to-consumer channel, but were offset by negative retail store comparable net sales. CEO Richard Hayne, said: "During the first quarter we continued to see strong double-digit growth from our direct-to-consumer channel and our wholesale business. We believe we have significant opportunity to continue to grow both of these channels at all of our brands." Dick's Sporting Goods Omni-channel sporting goods retailer Dick's Sporting Goods said that despite a challenging retail environment, it realised growth across each of its three primary categories of hardlines, apparel and footwear in the first quarter. For the period ended 29 April, net income reached US$58.2m compared to $56.9m in the year-ago period. Net sales were also up, increasing 9.9% to $1.8bn from $1.7bn last year. Looking ahead, CEO Edward Stack said the company will continue to "evaluate and adjust" its business model, and is taking actions to reduce its expense structure in order to fund and develop its longer-term strategic initiatives.

Net sales meanwhile, were up 19% to $40.1m from $33.7m in the prior year period, reflecting a 22% increase in wholesale segment sales and a 9% increase in consumer direct segment sales. The company added the sales increase was primarily due to sales from the addition of the Hudson Jeans and Swims brands for the full period. Gross margin fell to 46.4% compared to 48.5%last year, reflecting the inclusion of Hudson Jeans for the full quarter as well as the inclusion of Swims, which carry lower gross margin rates as primarily wholesale businesses. CEO Michael Buckley said the company is "pleased" with the progress it has made during the quarter, especially in its e-commerce business, which saw a 46% sales increase. Dillard's Dillard's has booked a drop in earnings and sales in its first-quarter, with net income falling to US$66.3m from $77.4m in the year-ago period. Net sales dropped to $1.42bn from $1.50bn a year earlier, while gross margin from retail operations improved 65 basis points.

Nordstrom Upscale US fashion retailer Nordstrom has booked first-quarter earnings in line with expectations. For the period ended 29 April, net earnings were up 37% to US$63m, from $46m in the year ago period.

Earnings in the period dropped to $71m from $115m last year, while gross margin narrowed to 38.1% from 39.1% in the prior year period. Sales totalled $5.34bn, a drop of 7.5% on sales of $5.77bn in the same period last year, reflecting, in part, store closures. Comparable sales on an owned basis were down 5.2%.

Earnings were up 14% to US$66m from $58m a year earlier, while gross margin improved 83 basis points to 36.4%. Sales, meanwhile, were down 3.2% to $3.84bn.

Wolverine Worldwide Wolverine Worldwide booked what it says was a solid start to the year with earnings and sales that beat expectations and strong progress towards its strategic transformation plan. Revenues dropped 4.8% to US$591.3m due to an additional week of operations in the first quarter of 2017. Underlying revenue declined 2%. Earnings dropped to $16.7m from $17.4m, while gross margin widened slightly to 39.7% from 39.6% last year.

Acting CEO Bruce Smith, said: "We are pleased to report that our improved merchandising strategies are driving better performance, as demonstrated by the increase in our first quarter comparable store sales. After a very slow start to the quarter due to the later disbursement of tax refunds by the Internal Revenue Service, we were able to more than make up February's 21% comparable store sales decline with increases of 13% in March and 18% in April." Weyco Weyco saw both sales and earnings slip in its first-quarter in the face of what it called a "challenging" retail environment. For the three months to 31 March, net earnings attributable to the company fell 17% to US$2.2m from $2.7m in the year-ago period. Meanwhile, net sales for the quarter slipped to $69.1m, down 12% from $78.9m last year. CEO Thomas Florsheim Jr said: "The retail environment continues to be challenging, as retailers address reduced foot traffic in their brick and mortar stores. We continue to seek growth across all trade channels and are working to reduce our costs.  This quarter we saw higher gross margins and reductions in several categories of selling and administrative costs as a result of our efforts."    Hanesbrands US fashion retailer Hanesbrands said it is off to the strong start of 2017 that it sought, despite net income slipping 12% to US$70.6m from $80.3m in the year-ago period. Net sales meanwhile, increased 13.2% to $1.38bn from $1.22bn last year, thanks to acquisition contributions.

Hanes has also launched a multiyear initiative to increase investment for growth, reduce costs, and drive cash flow. Project Booster, is expected to drive the company's Sell More, Spend Less, Generate Cash business strategy and is expected to generate about $100m in annualised net cost savings, and $300m of incremental annual net cash from operations after annualised growth reinvestment of $50m. The company has also recently announced the departure of CFO Richard Moss who will retire at the end of 2017. Hanesbrands has initiated an internal and external search for his successor.  VF Corp US apparel giant VF Corporation said its first-quarter results were "right in line" with expectations, despite a 2% fall in both sales and earnings for the period. Net income fell to US$209.2m in the three months to March, from $260.3m the year before. As a result of the sale of its licensed sports group business to Fanatics, VF's net loss from discontinued operations was $5.5m the first quarter of 2017. Gross margin improved 150 basis points to 50.2% on a reported basis, while total revenues fell to $2.55bn from $2.60bn in the year-ago period.

Net income also reached record levels, up 13% to $36m from $31.8m in the year ago period. For the year ahead, the company expects net sales growth of around 3%, and net income of between $192m and $199m. CEO Tim Boyle said: "Our first quarter results provide a good start to a year that presents many challenges, especially in the US, which has been impacted by customer bankruptcies, liquidations and ongoing efforts by US.retailers to rationalise their store fleets and square footage. We were encouraged by the Columbia brand's continued growth in Europe-direct markets during the first quarter and by the Sorel brand's successful launch of an expanded Spring assortment. In addition, our direct-to-consumer businesses were a source of growth in every region. "In the midst of changing consumer shopping patterns, our portfolio of powerful brands and strong balance sheet give us the ability to continue to drive sustainable, profitable growth." Amazon Online retail giant Amazon has booked increases in both sales and earnings in its first-quarter thanks to new product and service launches globally, including seven private apparel brands to Prime members. Net income reached US$724m from $513m a year prior. Net sales were up 23% to $35.7bn. Excluding a $492m unfavourable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates throughout the quarter, net sales increased 24%.

The loss for the three months to the end of March amounted to US$2.3m from earnings of $19.2m a year ago. Gross margin dropped 70 basis points to 45.2%. Net sales, however, grew 7% to $1.1bn. "Our first quarter results were in line with our expectations and we're off to a solid start in 2017," said Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank. "By proactively managing our growth to deliver superior innovative product, continuing to strengthen our connection with consumers and increasing our focus on operational excellence - we have great confidence in our ability to drive toward our full year targets." Carter's Carter's booked a mixed first-quarter, with a slight rise in sales but a 13.6% decrease in net income from US$54m to $46.7m. Operating margin also decreased, falling 210 basis points to 10.7%. Net sales, meanwhile, grew 1.2% to $732.8m, reflecting growth in the company's domestic retail and wholesale sales, which was partially offset by a decline in International sales. CEO Michael Casey, said: "We achieved our sales and earnings objectives in the first quarter. Stronger than planned demand in our wholesale and ecommerce businesses helped to offset the effects of delayed tax refunds to families with young children and a later Easter holiday. "We have seen a meaningful improvement in sales trends in April, driven by Easter holiday shopping, and expect good growth in sales and earnings in the balance of the year."  Steve Madden US footwear and accessories specialist Steve Madden said it pleased to have started off 2017 with a strong first-quarter, despite delivering a 15.6% drop in earnings. For the three months ended 31 March, net income fell to US$20.2m from $23.7m last year. However, the company said its highlight of the quarter was its Steve Madden women's wholesale footwear division, which enjoyed a period of "outstanding growth in a challenging retail environment". Net sales increased 11.2% to $366.4m, compared to $329.4m in the year-ago period. Gross margin widened to 36.2%, compared to 35.3% last year. CEO Edward Rosenfeld said the company will take a prudent approach to planning its business in light of retail industry headwinds, but added the strength in its core business "gives us confidence that we are well-positioned to navigate the uncertain environment".  Skechers Despite first-quarter net sales representing a new quarterly record and the first time the company has exceeded US$1bn in quarterly sales, footwear maker Skechers saw earnings slip in the three months ended 31 March. Sales in the quarter were up 9.6% to $1.07bn on last year, primarily due to a 16.8% increase in the company's international wholesale business and a 12.8% rise in its company-owned global retail business which included comparable same-store sales increases of 2.9%. However, earnings slipped 3.7% to $94m, compared to $97.6m in the year-ago period. CEO David Weinberg said: "We are particularly proud of the growth in the quarter considering the tough comparison to 2016, which included the benefit of an additional day in February and Easter falling in March." Rocky Brands Rocky Brands says it has made a "solid start" to 2017 as it moved to a profit thanks to doubling its military segment sales to a quarterly record US$12m. Net income in the three months ended 31 March amounted to $1.5m from a loss of $0.2m a year earlier. Net sales meanwhile, increased 9.6% to $63.1m, compared to $57.5m in the year-ago period. Wholesale sales declined 2.5% to $39.2m, while retail sales edged up to $11.9m from $11.5m. Gross margin dropped 160 basis points to 31.3%, driven by the increase in military segment sales which carry lower gross margins than its wholesale and retail segments. CEO Mike Brooks said: "The actions we have taken over the past six months to better position the company for profitable growth are clearly gaining traction. While there is still work ahead of us in order to maximise shareholder value over the long-term, we are confident we are heading in the right direction." Kate Spade & Co Kate Spade saw earnings slump to US$1.4m in the three months ended 1 April, from $11.6m a year earlier. The company incurred a $7m of pre-tax store impairment charge and $2m of pre-tax fees and expenses related to its strategic review. Gross margin widened to 63.2% from 61.8%, but net sales dropped 1.2% to $271m. Same-store sales fell 2.4% for the quarter, and were down 8.1% excluding e-commerce.  Direct-to-consumer comparable sales fell 2%. Levi Strauss & Co Jeans giant Levi Strauss & Co saw net sales increase in the first quarter, up 4% to US$1.10bn from $1.06bn in the year-ago period. In the three months ended 26 February, net income slipped to $60m, down 9% from $66m last year. The decline primarily reflected lower gross margins, the San Francisco-based company said. Gross margin narrowed to 51.2% from 53%. In Europe, net revenues were up 12%, while in the Americas sales dropped by 1% and Asia net revenues declined 2%. "Despite the on-going challenges in the industry, I am pleased that we delivered 5% currency-neutral growth over a strong Q1 last year," said Chip Bergh, president and CEO. "We were able to deliver these solid results despite a declining US wholesale business, because of the breadth of our portfolio. Specifically, we grew in all three regions, with particularly outstanding results in Europe; double digit growth in our direct-to-consumer business; and double digit growth on women's and tops."

In a post on Facebook, Eva Hicks explained she "never in my life thought this would happen to me" - saying despite the racially motivated remarks from the woman, she loves America and will stay in the country. In the footage, the elderly woman can be heard unleashing on Ms Hicks after an altercation that allegedly started with the woman cutting her off and pushing her with her trolley. "Go back to Mexico. Go back wherever you're from. You're in America! You're in America!" the woman can be heard yelling at the start of the clip. Another shopper then interjects - and after being told to "stay out it", the shopper, who does not appear on camera says: "I don't need to stay out of it [because] you're yelling loud enough for everybody to hear", before urging her to "stop being ignorant". "A n**ger's calling me ignorant?" she says incredulously, before refocusing her attention on Ms Hicks. "You're the one that's rude. You know what you said. Just get out of here. Go back to Mexico. This isn't your country - we don't want you here." At that moment a Walmart employee approaches the conflict, saying "that's not true, we do want you here", before asking the woman to leave store. "I'm gonna have to ask you to leave, ma'am. This is inappropriate. You're causing a scene in the store," the employee says. The elderly woman then starts fake-crying, mocking Ms Hicks for being upset by the comments she'd made. But she refuses to leave, and again turns to Ms Hicks, saying: "Get your stuff and go. I'm not gonna listen to her mouth [off]." After yet more bickering, the woman appears to lose patience and walks away. "Whatever - I ain't listening to this bullcrap." Walmart is looking into the incident, saying they "value and respect everyone who visits our stores". "We have no tolerance for the language or actions of this customer and are proud that our assistant manager responded appropriately by asking her to leave the store," the company said in a statement. It is not known whether the police are getting involved. Newshub.

Every parent knows that. Not by themselves, of course – they’re clearly in cahoots with college registrars, airline gate agents, and checkers at Wal-Mart. There’s probably a secret meeting place where the people who decide to close half the checkout lanes compare notes with those who pick the passengers to get bumped. But the school bus drivers – well, there’s a lot of power behind that bifold yellow door. It’s important to get a good one. And in case you forget, there’s a sub driver lurking just around the corner ready to pounce. You start to appreciate your regular driver when you’ve been standing on the corner for 45 minutes and your boss is blowing up your phone with texts that say things like, “Are you coming to work today?” And you know it’s a sub, so you don’t have a cell number, and either he is at least 45 minutes behind schedule because he doesn’t know the route or he came 15 minutes early and blew by your stop because your little darling wasn’t standing there with his backpack slung over his shoulder. Dilemma: Wait five more minutes hoping he’ll show up, or throw your kid in the backseat and take your chances with the dreaded car line. That is a lose-lose proposition. School bus drivers can insist you wait at the exact spot on the route map, no matter that it’s 12 degrees and hailing basketballs. They can assign your child a seat away from his friends, ensuring endless whining about the unfairness of it all. They can drop your first-grader off at your house without a thought as to whether anyone’s home. Or they can be Jim Slaughter. Mr. Slaughter, who has been driving Bus No. 1 for 15 years, is that rare school bus driver who might detour a block off his route so your child doesn’t have to wait in the snow or walk home in the sleet. He’s the driver who will send you a text to let you know he’s running 10 minutes late because there was an accident on Second Street. And if your car, which is always in the driveway in the afternoon, isn’t there that day, he might give you call before letting your child off his bus. Sure, parents love him. But so do the kids. He might assign them seats that allow calmness and sanity to prevail, but there’s Free Seat Friday to make up for it. He’ll take help; fifth-graders can be bus helpers, but only after they’ve written an application essay explaining why they want to do it and why they should be selected. It’s an honor – and a leadership lesson. Well-behaved children are likely to get rewarded with a bag of donut holes on Friday, but Mr. Slaughter is likely to have a word with the parents of those who are less angelic. And if you were lucky enough to be on Mr. Slaughter’s route at the end of fifth grade, you got invited to a Jim-Slaughter-sponsored pizza party one afternoon just before summer vacation. He manages a bus the way good managers run a company: He’s fair. He holds them accountable when they make a mistake. He rewards them when they excel. He gives them an opportunity to advance. He earns his charges’ respect, and they earn his. Bus business is serious, but there are also donut holes and pizzas. On Tuesday, Mr. Slaughter, a former Air Force special investigator, drove Bus No. 1 for the last time. He’s ready to retire again. Come August, that’s going to be a very big seat to fill.   Share this: Email Print Facebook LinkedIn Twitter Google Jim SLaughter management Periscope school bus Ted Streuli 7:49 pm Tue, May 23, 2017 The Journal Record Ted Streuli Tagged with: Jim SLaughter management Periscope school bus Ted Streuli Related Articles Prosperity Policy: Let’s talk about jobs May 24, 2017 Right Thinking: A clear mandate for policy reform May 24, 2017 Gavel to Gavel: A new wrinkle for annual event May 24, 2017 Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Scott vetoes bill to tear down ‘liquor wall’ BY JIM TURNER News Service of Florida LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story TALLAHASSEE Pointing to concerns about preserving small-business jobs, Gov. Rick Scott on Wednesday vetoed a heavily debated and lobbied measure that supporters said would repeal a relic of the nation’s emergence from Prohibition. The so called “liquor wall” law, which requires hard spirits to be sold in separate facilities from most retail goods, will remain in place after Scott’s veto of the repeal bill. The veto was a victory for independent liquor-store owners, ABC Fine Wine & Spirits and Publix Super Markets, which fought the bill during the legislative session that ended May 8. Scott’s decision on the proposal (SB 106) also ends for now the noisy legislative battles about the issue. Supporters of eliminating the law, including retailers Target, Costco and Walmart, argued that a repeal would promote free markets and customer convenience. “We have made tremendous progress in the last four years, and there is a clear momentum in Florida for this common-sense approach to liquor sales,” said Michael Williams, a spokesman for the group Floridians for Fair Business Practices, which supported the repeal. “While Governor Scott ultimately chose to veto Senate Bill 106, we look forward to working with state leaders in the future to finally put an end to this outdated, Prohibition-era law.” Scott, in a letter accompanying his first vetoed bill of the year, said the proposal’s impact on small businesses outweighed his desire to further cut regulations. “I carefully reviewed this bill and I have met with stakeholders on both sides,” Scott said. “I listened closely to what they had to say and I understand that both positions have merit. Nevertheless, I have heard concerns as to how this bill could affect many small businesses across Florida. I was a small business owner and many locally owned businesses have told me how this bill will impact their families and their ability to create jobs.” Opponents of the bill argued that a repeal would hurt small liquor stores, eliminate jobs, result in a greater ability for minors to get liquor and lead to more impulse-buying of alcohol. I listened closely to what they had to say and I understand that both positions have merit. Nevertheless, I have heard concerns as to how this bill could affect many small businesses across Florida. Gov. Rick Scott “We applaud Governor Scott for saving hundreds of Florida small businesses that employ thousands of Floridians, while at the same time keeping safeguards in place for minors,” ABC Fine Wine & Spirits Chief Executive Officer and President Charles Bailes said in a prepared statement. Along with the independent liquor stores, Publix has been involved because it operates stand-alone liquor stores in many of the same shopping centers as its grocery stores. Meanwhile, retailers such as Target and Walmart — battling online sales — have been looking to sell liquor in the same stores where shoppers pick up groceries and other goods. The bill was highly controversial, passing the Senate in a 21-17 vote and the House by a 58-57 margin. Members of the Florida Independent Spirits Association, which also opposed the repeal, mobilized after the bill received final legislative approval April 26. “More than 1,000 letters and 3,000 petitions from around the state were delivered to the governor with the message that vetoing this bill would save our Florida small retailers and jobs that help our local economies,” Florida Independent Spirits Association President Rory Eggers said in a release thanking Scott. The bill would have prohibited new package stores from being licensed within 1,000 feet of schools; required small bottles, 6.8 ounces or less, to be displayed only behind the counter; and required that checkout clerks under the age of 18 be supervised by people 18 or older when alcohol is purchased.

Authorities identified the suspect as Derick Montez Robinson, 43, of Hillsboro. Police Chief Clint Reck said Robinson has a first-degree sexual abuse conviction. Reck said police have received complaints since Sunday about a man approaching and harassing women at various locations. "We've had three women come in and file reports," the chief said. "He's approaching females and making them feel uncomfortable with some of the things he's saying." He said video footage from Wal-Mart shows a man identified as Robinson shoving a shopping cart into a female. A warrant has been issued on a misdemeanor harassment charge in connection with that event. Police said the suspect's vehicle is a black 1999 Chevrolet Silverado pickup with the license number 42AS196. He is 6 feet 2 inches tall and weighs 217 pounds, and could have a gold tooth, the chief said. Reck said anyone who sees someone matching the description of the suspect or a vehicle matching the description should call the law enforcement agency in the city or call 911. "If you see him, don't approach him," he said. There have been posts on social media about encounters with the suspect. "It's got lot of folks uneasy," Reck said. "We're working as hard as we can to get him arrested. If anyone knows where he is, please report it so we can get him picked up." Subscribe bernie.delinski@timesdaily.com or 256-740-5739.

Warren is pushing as bill that would negatively disrupt the hearing aid market, Hamilton writes. (Photo: Jose Luis Magana / AP) CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Michigan’s population is aging faster than other states and, increasingly, issues affecting seniors are becoming more important for our elected officials at the state and federal level. The fastest growing age group is 65 to 74. This puts aging policy issues, particularly those involving health care, at the top of the heap. Yet, as liberals in Washington are pushing to upend the current market for hearing aids, a medical device used disproportionately by senior citizens, Michigan’s members of Congress aren’t pushing back hard enough. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, along with Rep. Joe Kennedy III, is pushing legislation that would create a new category of federal regulation, lumping in complex medical devices custom-shaped for an individual’s ears with over-the-counter products already available at retailers like Wal-Mart. This is being hailed as a “disruptive” move from Washington by the tech media. In reality, it’s a profit-driven attack on doctor-patient privilege by tech companies looking to benefit from the influence of their home state representatives. Conservative groups have spoken out vigorously against this, sending a letter last week to the Senate and another to the House this week, where the legislation is being voted on in the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which includes Reps. Fred Upton and Tim Walberg. The letter, signed by 20 groups including the aging organization 60 plus and pro-consumer group American Consumer Institute, took three main issues with the proposed bill. First, it would add unnecessary federal regulation to a class of products already widely available at a low cost. Second, it would supersede state regulations designed to protect consumers, and finally, it would cut doctors and medically-trained audiologists out of the diagnosis and treatment equation. This last point is particularly troubling. As one medical professional recently noted, “the average American who is having trouble fully hearing conversations around the dinner table is simply not qualified to diagnose and treat disorders and diseases of the ear, just because they think they know their own bodies … in April of this year, the organization for Better Hearing Centers released a number of reasons someone could misdiagnose hearing loss: misinformation, ageism, accuracy of cognitive tests, or medical crisis situations. Any number of factors can lead someone to think they are experiencing hearing loss, some more dangerous than others, therefore it is imperative it be correctly diagnosed before simply purchasing a hearing aid.” The legislation has been called the “Bose bill” on Capitol Hill, as Bose, a Massachusetts-based company, makes devices which would be characterized as OTC hearing aids under the proposed bill. The company has already spent more than $500,000 lobbying legislators this year, including both Congressmen Upton and Walberg from Michigan, who sit on the House Energy and Commerce Committee. As conservative groups and seniors organizations have lined up against this bill, others are starting to vocalize their opposition to it as well. The Gun Owners of America are opposed, citing the potential inclusion of “hearing enhancers” used by hunters under this new category of regulation, and concerns over Warren’s use of “any pretext, however attenuated, to interfere with hunting and the exercise of Second Amendment rights.” This misguided legislation casts a wide net, to the detriment of a large and growing number of constituencies. Michigan’s delegation is in a uniquely powerful position to oppose this legislation, and voters should urge them do to so. It’s the wrong fix for the wrong problem, at the wrong time. And the consequences, unintended or not, could cause irreparable harm. Amelia Hamilton is a national commentator and author focusing on education, government overreach and culture.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Thursday, 25 May 2017 | MYT 10:30 AM Retailers can’t move fast enough to chase shoppers online by stephanie ritenbaugh More shopping is shifting online and consumer tastes are changing, leaving retailers to scramble to adapt to the evolving retail environment. — Dreamstime/TNS PITTSBURGH: The idea of spending a leisurely few hours of the weekend at the mall – browsing aisles for a new pair of jeans and shoes and hitting the food court – is going out of style.  The latest in a growing list of retail casualties, mall-staple and teen apparel company rue21 Inc. filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganisation last week, joining the ranks of Payless, American Apparel, Aeropostale, hhgregg, and The Limited, who have all recently declared bankruptcy.  Rue21's decision came one month after the chain, headquartered outside Pittsburgh, began closing about 400 of its more than 1,100 stores in 48 states.  This year, retail bankruptcies have set a record pace. According to S&P Global Market Intelligence, the number of bankruptcies in early 2017 had already come close to the total in 2016. Between January and April, 14 retailers filed compared to 18 last year. (The report was released before rue21 filed on May 15.)  The primary factors putting the squeeze on retailers are known: more shopping is shifting online and consumer tastes are changing, with shoppers opting for gadgets or experiences over the trendiest jacket.  "It's not new news that mall traffic is weak, but it continues to weaken," said Christina Broni, vice-president and senior analyst for Moody's Investors Services. "Changing consumer behaviour and e-commerce continue to weigh on performance."  The result is that there are too many stores and too little customer traffic to keep them going.  And companies are trying to figure out the best way for them to adapt to a changing retail environment. Many are shrinking their store footprint, cutting costs and shifting their focus to e-commerce, but they are approaching those goals from different angles. Maybe that means shutting down stores. Maybe, in the case of Kohl's, it means slashing store sizes instead.  Noting that each struggling company has its own story, "It is widely agreed that the US is over-stored and that the solution for flat or declining in-store sales resides to a significant degree online, where the most sales growth is now taking place," according to a recent report from S&P Global Market Intelligence.  American Eagle Outfitters, based in Pittsburgh, told analysts last week that it plans to move faster in shuttering some stores while aiming to capture online sales.  "We are looking to get more aggressive with store closings," said Charles Kessler, global brand president said last week. "We've been experimenting with closures of stores where we are able to really track sales migration and really analyse the relationship of the stores to our digital business."  Still, American Eagle sees value in its brick-and-mortar stores. The store base is "the best place for us to drive new customer acquisitions" and 80% of online returns are taken back to stores, Kessler noted.  Dick's Sporting Goods, also based in the Pittsburgh region, also said last week that it will slow its brick-and-mortar store growth, especially as big names like Macy's, JC Penney, Sears and Kmart shutter more locations, adding more vacancies to the market.  Edward Stack, chairman and CEO, said Dick's could get better rental rates if it waits to open new stores. He also noted that about 25% of the company's stores will be up for lease renewal in the next three years, giving Dick's the flexibility to decide which leases are best to renew.  Meanwhile, "Kohl's has made the strategic decision to keep the number of store locations relatively unchanged – opting instead to reduce inventory and store sizes to achieve increased productivity," Moody's Investors Services said in a report released last week.  Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, is trying to go toe-to-toe with the Amazon.com for online sales domination. The Bentonville, Arkansas-based company reported last week that online growth surged 63% in the most recent quarter.  Part of Wal-Mart's strategy has been to shift more resources toward its digital assets as well as to buy up smaller online retailers, like Modcloth, to expand its reach.  Still, it takes time to find the right formula to amping up a store's website and shipping capabilities.  Both Dick's and American Eagle noted last week that shipping costs related to their online sales are putting their margins under pressure. That's something a lot of retailers are dealing with.  Amazon.com's free shipping and Prime membership perks have set a benchmark in the industry, Boni noted.  "Consumers are used to that," she said. "It becomes more beholden on the retailer to get shipping costs down. How much of those costs they're able to pass on is challenging in this environment."  The impact of the dramatic shift in shopping patterns isn't just affecting retailers either. When a big chain goes out of business or significantly scales back its brick-and-mortar locations, tremors are felt by other stores or even in other sectors.  S&P notes that as real estate vacancies increase and rental income disappears, commercial real estate development becomes riskier.  "Supplier risk can escalate as well. In fact, Business Insider reported that a least half a dozen suppliers have significantly reduced product shipments to Sears over fears of bankruptcy and how it might affect their own bottom line," S&P Global Market Intelligence said.  For retailers to adapt, they're going to have to figure out how they can be relevant to customers.  "Department stores have a different role than they did 10 years ago," Boni said.  "Personalisation, having exclusive products, those are things that should improve topline trends," she said. "There's not a quick fix. It's an evolution over time and companies have started to take meaningful steps, but it will take time to see the progress." — Pittsburgh Post-Gazette/Tribune News Service Related Stories You May Be Interested Celcom now offers Walla passes for video and music streaming Google adds YouTube to suite of ad tools tracking retail sales Social media trolls spread rumours Facebook signs BuzzFeed, Vox, others for original video shows: sources Brazil appeals court rules Uber driver not entitled to benefits Racing for a better tomorrow Others Also Read Klang’s third bridge opens Restaurant‘s first public Ramadan buffet offers 35 traditional Malay dishes Republican congressional candidate in Montana accused of assaulting reporter advertisement Latest News Fliers’ electronics get more screening in 10-airport test Xbox adds Netflix-style videogame subscriptions China’s DJI unveils US$499 drone that flies from your hand WannaCry hits Russian postal service, exposes wider security shortcomings Facebook signs BuzzFeed, Vox, others for original video shows: sources Most Viewed in Tech China’s DJI unveils US$499 drone that flies from your hand Huge changes are likely for the new iPhone 8: reports Hackers are now using subtitle files to take over devices WannaCry hits Russian postal service, exposes wider security shortcomings Foreign firms fret as China implements new cybersecurity law Xbox adds Netflix-style videogame subscriptions Fliers’ electronics get more screening in 10-airport test Amazon Wants You: Retail giant turns to military vets as it looks for management talent Facebook signs BuzzFeed, Vox, others for original video shows: sources Four key combinations for browsers every computer user should know Powered by advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online   Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

that allows food stamp recipients to use their EBT cards to shop at a farmers market in Topsham, Maine. A proposal to curtail the nation’s food stamp program would pinch families struggling to pay for groceries and ripple through other areas of the economy, including supermarkets and discounters. Associated Press files By CANDICE CHOI, Associated Press Published: May 24, 2017, 9:17 PM A   A NEW YORK — A proposal to curtail the nation’s food stamp program would pinch families struggling to pay for groceries and ripple through other areas of the economy, including supermarkets and discounters, as people shuffle their budgets. President Donald Trump is proposing a roughly 30 percent reduction in the federal budget for the program formally known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. His overall budget proposal met a chilly reception from lawmakers, and is unlikely to be passed as is. But it suggests increasing work requirements for SNAP recipients, and says states should both share in the cost of the program and determine the level of benefits they provide. That would lead to fewer people in the program, or could reduce how much help they get. Last year, more than 44 million people received an average of about $125 a month in SNAP benefits, totaling about $66.6 billion, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. How any cuts would play out across industries would depend on how people adjust to pay for food, how reliant a retailer is on SNAP spending and other factors. Here’s a look at what we know. • WHO USES SNAP, AND WHERE ARE THEY SHOPPING? SNAP households are already on extremely tight budgets. To qualify, a family of four’s take-home pay can be no more than $2,025 a month, while a two-person household can earn no more than $1,335. More than 260,000 locations were authorized to accept SNAP credits last year. Superstores such as Wal-Mart and Target got 52 percent of redemptions, supermarkets like Kroger got 30 percent, and convenience stores got about 6 percent, according to the USDA. The rest was split among other kinds of stores. • WHAT HAPPENED WITH PREVIOUS SNAP CUTS? It’s complicated. Since food is a fixed cost, retailers have said that people used money intended for other purposes to pay for groceries after a recent pullback in the program. “They’re paying cash or on a credit card if they didn’t have the food stamps. And then they will give up on something else,” Kroger’s CEO at the time, Dave Dillon, said in December 2013. That was after the SNAP benefits that were expanded during the recession returned to their previous levels. But how companies are affected can vary and it’s difficult to pinpoint the impact of any one change on sales, which can be affected by weather, competitive pressure and other factors. After the 2013 rollback in benefits, Wal-Mart blamed a 0.4 percent quarterly sales decline on the reduction, though the sales figure was down for the company’s entire fiscal year. Dollar General, which has said it gets about 5 percent of its sales from SNAP benefits, compared the impact of the reduction last year to what happened in 2013. “Our traffic slowed tremendously then, very similar to as it did now,” Dollar General CEO Todd Vasos said last summer. • WHAT CHANGES FOR RETAILERS? Trump’s proposal suggests that retailers pay a fee for authorization to accept food stamps. Companies currently don’t pay to participate, which the proposal says fails to recognize “the significant portion of a retailer’s revenue that SNAP can represent.” The proposed budget estimates the fees would raise about $2.4 billion over 10 years. It doesn’t spell out how the fee would be calculated. Imposing a fee could result in smaller stores or chains deciding not to seek authorization, said Craig Gundersen, a professor of agricultural economics at the University of Illinois who has received financial support from the Wal-Mart Foundation and grants from the agency that administers the food stamp program. That would reduce the number of places where people who use SNAP could get groceries. • HOW DO SNAP CUTS AFFECT THE LARGER ECONOMY? The government’s overall SNAP spending declines when the economy improves and fewer people rely on the program. It’s a situation that is the “best possible outcome,” said Stacy Dean, vice president of food assistance policy at the liberal-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Dean said cutting benefits when people’s financial situations are not improving could mean they use money they otherwise would have spent on needs like clothing or even medicine to make up for the gaps in their food budget. So there’s still an impact to the overall economy, she said.

In the words of F. Scott Fitzgerald, "They are different from you and me." Yet still, we yearn to find some commonality, perhaps to imagine whether it's possible to some day be like them - or dream of what we might do with all that money. For instance, I was born in 1986, the same year as Lukas Walton, the scion of the retailing giant Walmart, who is worth more than $11 billion, according to Forbes. There's a certain masochistic pleasure in comparing my lot in life with his. Although I would not trade places with Walton's for $11 billion, it's still fun to imagine. Which is why we compiled this list of the richest person born in each year from 1917 to 1996. Money started with the 2017 Forbes The World's Billionaires list, then cross-referenced each person's wealth against Bloomberg's Billionaires Index to make sure the numbers weren't wildly off, and then asked Wealth-X to use their database to double check each person's age. What did we learn? - Combined, the people on our list are estimated to be worth $1.4 trillion, or 2% of the global gross domestic product. - The easiest way to get on this list, especially if you were born after 1957, is to be born into money or marry it. - If you have to work, be computer literate. Nearly all of the U.S.-bred billionaires earned their wealth in technology, from Evan Spiegel to Michael Bloomberg. - In total, Americans make up 38% of our list; Europeans, 24%; and Asians, 20%. But while most Europeans on this list inherited their fortunes, 80% of the Asians were self-made. - The road to supreme wealth is roughest for women. Only 14% of the list is female.

Using the metric of county statistics, the answer is Colorado's Aspen (pictured here) and Wyoming's Jackson (Pitkin and Teton counties respectively). JACKSON, WYO. — Which ski towns have the biggest bucks? (And no, this isn't a joke about masculinity). Using the metric of county statistics, the answer is Colorado's Aspen and Wyoming's Jackson (Pitkin and Teton counties respectively). But there's another metric, called a micropolitan. Using that measure and arbitrarily picking several metrics relative to wealth, Bloomberg concludes that Utah's Summit Park, i.e. Park City, to be the No. 1 micropolitan in the U.S. for wealth. Following it is Colorado's Edwards micropolitan, home to Vail and Beaver Creek, and Wyoming's Jackson. Aspen lags down the list at eighth, behind Colorado's Summit County and Steamboat Springs at fifth and sixth. Of the top 10 most affluent micropolitan areas, six are in ski areas of the West. Following them are Heber, Utah, which is near Park City, and Durango, Colo., and a bit down the list are Truckee and Grass Valley in California, and Hailey-Ketchum-Sun Valley in Idaho. The U.S. Census Bureau introduced micropolitans after the 2000 census as a way of distinguishing smaller areas, of 10,000 to 50,000 population, that better describe an economic, geographic unit. They're almost always big enough to have a Wal-Mart Supercenter. They're not strictly defined by incorporated areas or county boundaries. The Bloomberg index is based on four equally weighted metrics: median household income, the percentage of households with at least US$200,000 in income, median home value and the percentage of homes worth $1,000,000 or more. An 8,000-metre peak in winter — without oxygen! ASPEN, Colo. — By day, Mike Marolt is an accountant and, at age 52, at least on the cusp of what most people consider middle age. But don't mistake him for anybody remotely ordinary. Together with his identical twin, Steve Marolt and fellow adventurer Jim Gile, he plans to travel in January 2018 to Tibet. There, on the world's sixth tallest mountain, Cho Oyu, they hope to do something unique in the human experience. The trio hopes to ski from above 8,000 metres or, failing that, at least 7,000 metres — and without supplemental oxygen. They also plan to do this without assistance of Sherpa guides, part of what he calls the modern climbing "infrastructure." Mike called this "pure climbing," bringing to mind the words of the famous Italian climber Reinhold Messner, who was the first to climb Everest without oxygen, what he called "fair means." Mike recently spoke to a business group in Aspen, where he lives and where he grew up, at a gathering covered by the Aspen Daily News. The trio began skiing from the world's highest peaks in 1997. By then, alpine touring equipment had become advanced enough that skis could be used not just to get to a peak, but also to have fun while descending, he said. In Pakistan, they skied from 8,000 metres on Broad Peak, the world's 12th highest mountain. That was in summer. "Immediately, we knew we wanted to take it to the next level," he said, and by that he meant Everest, the very highest. But by then, Everest was becoming a problem for even good climbers, as was evident the year before. Eight people died one day in May 1996, and the deaths were at least partly attributable to the bottlenecks on the mountain route. There were just too many people. Climbing without supplemental oxygen elevates risks. It requires moving rapidly. Stopping even briefly — particularly in the alpine touring boots, as opposed to warmer, climbing boots — is too risky. "The thing about climbing without supplemental oxygen and without infrastructure is that you can't stop moving; you have to continue moving because your circulation is so impaired from the lack of oxygen," Mike said. He and his companions have tried climbing Everest without oxygen, first in 2003 and again in 2007, skiing from high elevations, but not the summit. "We nearly lost our feet," he said. Even turning around short of the summit, his feet were numb for six months afterward. Crowds will be absent on Cho Oyu, but the conditions he described to his Aspen audience sound nearly impossible. The jet stream sinks to 7,000 to 8,000 metres, or the tops of the peak, producing harsh winds, and temperatures can drop below minus 37 C. For winter training, they've tested themselves in Peru on a 6,400-metre peak, going from a base camp in one day at 1,500 metres. They did a 2,700-metres day on a 6,400-metre peak in Bolivia. Obviously, these are guys without pudgy, middle-age bellies. Trump vows to bring back coal, but tide is against him CRAIG, Colo. — With coal miners at his side, U.S. President Donald Trump last week signed an executive order that seeks to undo the Obama administration's Clean Power Plan. In coal towns, there was rejoicing. The plan requires a gradual bending of power sources to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions 32 per cent by 2030. Unless carbon capture and storage technology advances rapidly, this puts coal at a great disadvantage. Coal plants were already closing in droves. They've been losing out to cheaper natural gas, which has fewer greenhouse-gas emissions and can be dispatched in a matter of minutes, unlike coal plants, which take about a day to crank up. This makes natural gas a better fit with renewables, whose prices have tumbled dramatically in the last five years. But coal plants in the Rocky Mountains have also been closing because of their dirty environmental footprint, not even considering greenhouse-gas emissions. The sulfur dioxide and other emissions contribute heavily to regional haze. For example, PacifiCorp announced it would close one of the generating units at its power plant at Kemmerer, Wyo., located south of Jackson Hole. The plant provides power for Park City. The reason: the electricity wasn't needed, because of improved energy efficiency, and to upgrade the plants to reduce pollutants was too expensive. In northwest Colorado, Tri-State Generation and Transmission and other electrical providers have agreed to shut down a 427-megawatt power plant at Craig by 2025. This is 68 kilometres west of Steamboat Springs. Again, the problem is regional haze and other environmental pollutants. In New Mexico, it's the same story. There, two units of the San Juan Generating Station are to be shut down by the end of this year, notes the Durango Herald (Colorado). The Herald reported that the Public Service Co. of New Mexico is deciding whether the remaining units at the San Juan complex will operate beyond 2022. At the Colorado Solar Energy Industries Association conference, former Colorado Gov. Bill Ritter pointed to action at state and local levels, along with that of private companies, all aiming to clean up energy sources. Among those pushing are a variety of Republican governors in an organization called the Conservative Energy Network. "What this makes me believe is that no matter what happens at the federal level for the time being, there are opportunities," said Ritter. Wyoming didn't join that coalition, even if Gov. Matt Mead continues to prod his state into making changes. Jonathan Schechter, writing in the Jackson Hole News&Guide, while pondering his own mortality, wants Wyoming to similarly quit denying that the day for the end of coal is drawing nigh. Wyoming has been living high with its go-to source for low-sulfur coal since the 1980s. You can still see mile-long coal trains grinding their way through Denver's booming LoDo section on their way to plants as distant as Texas, Mississippi, and even, for a time, Florida. But nearly 40 per cent of the nation's coal-fired power plants closed between 2006 and 2016, and most remaining plants are on the verge of functional obsolescence. In 20 years, Schechter observes, nearly 90 per cent of the plants will be 40 years old or older. As these plants close down — likely to be replaced by natural gas and renewables — "so too will the market for Wyoming's coal, and with it the economic benefits coal has bestowed upon our state." Wyoming has no income tax. That simple fact, as much as the amazing sight of the Teton Range, may explain why Jackson Hole rivals Aspen for billionaires per capita. "When the day comes that income is taxed, Jackson Hole will start to become home to a much different demographic," Schechter concluded. Wow, what a lot of snow in Jackson Hole JACKSON, Wyo. — The Teton County fairgrounds in Jackson are looking pretty ugly right now after being the dumping ground for streets plowed through the winter in Jackson. The snow is piled 17 metres high, the tallest seen in at least 20 years. And it's dense snow, too, packed down to make room, reported the Jackson Hole News&Guide.

The GOP bill would lower average premiums, but in part that would be because coverage would typically be skimpier. ___ Trump budget faces Dem opposition, GOP doubts about math WASHINGTON (AP) — Donald Trump's budget chief gave a spirited defense of the president's budget plan in a Capitol Hill appearance Wednesday, though the agriculture secretary could only offer a half-hearted endorsement of cuts to farm subsidies and food stamps. The appearances by Cabinet members come a day after Trump's budget was released. The officials faced tough questions from Democrats opposed to the blueprint and Republicans skeptical about the administration's math. ___ Trump's budget means deep cuts for health care safety net WASHINGTON (AP) — As a candidate Donald Trump promised to make health care more affordable, but as president his first full budget calls for deep cuts to safety-net insurance programs. Meanwhile, the budget omits any proposal for negotiating prescription drug prices, a frequent talking point for Trump. The budget doesn't address Medicare's long term financial problems, but targets the much smaller Children's Health Insurance Program. Trump's Medicaid cuts appear even bigger than those the House recently passed. ___ How food stamp cuts could ripple through the economy NEW YORK (AP) — A proposal to curtail the nation's food stamp program would pinch struggling families and ripple through other areas of the economy. The exact impact in any one area is difficult to quantify but a majority of SNAP benefits are spent at superstores and supermarkets. Walmart has said in the past that it gets about 18 percent of total SNAP benefits. Supporters of the SNAP program also say people could end up using money intended for other items like clothing for groceries. ___ Serena Williams accepts a new challenge - in Silicon Valley SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Tennis star Serena Williams wants to help diversify the tech industry now that she is joining a Silicon Valley boardroom for the first time. Online poll taking service SurveyMonkey announced Williams' appointment to its board on Wednesday. Like many other African-Americans, Williams has been disappointed with the Silicon Valley hiring practices that have resulted in the vast majority of high-paying technology jobs being filled by white and Asian men. ___ Women CEOs earn big pay, but few of them have the top job NEW YORK (AP) — Women CEOs earned big bucks last year, but there's still very few of them running the world's largest companies. The median pay for a female CEO was $13.1 million last year, up 9 percent from 2015, according to an analysis by executive data firm Equilar and The Associated Press. But the number of women in CEO roles has barely budged. ___ Airlines have rules about taking photos, video on planes DALLAS (AP) — Be careful what you video on your next flight, it could be against airline rules. Major US airlines say they limit what you can photograph or capture on video. Lawyers say the policies might not stand up in court. ___ United CEO assures shareholders at meeting; workers protest CHICAGO (AP) — The CEO of United Airlines assured shareholders that the company is doing all it can to be more customer-friendly since video surfaced of a passenger being violently ejected from a plane last month. Outside the meeting, contract workers demanded higher pay. Get breaking news sent instantly to your inbox Sign Up!

One company said that it will no longer sponsor his show. Hannity, a staunch supporter of President Trump and the last prime-time tie to Fox's glory years, reached a big audience Tuesday with attention drawn to him. ___ US stocks extend gains to a 5th day as tech companies rise NEW YORK (AP) — Stocks rose for the fifth day in a row and the Standard & Poor's 500 set another record. Technology and materials companies made some of the biggest gains. Bond yields fell as the Federal Reserve discussed selling some of its bond holdings. ___ Certified pre-owned cars cost more, but come with perks DETROIT (AP) — A certified pre-owned vehicle costs more than a regular used car, but it can give buyers some peace of mind in the often murky used car market. Certified pre-owned vehicles are used cars that are backed by an automaker's guarantee. They're usually newer cars, coming off two- or three-year leases. ___ The Standard & Poor's 500 index picked up 5.97 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,404.39. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 74.51 points, or 0.4 percent, to 21,012.42. The Nasdaq composite rose 24.31 points, or 0.4 percent, to 6,163.02. Benchmark U.S. crude lost 11 cents to settle at $51.36 per barrel in New York while Brent crude, used to price international oils, sank 19 cents to $53.96 a barrel in London. Wholesale gasoline gave up 1 cent to $1.65 a gallon. Heating oil remained at $1.61 a gallon. Natural gas lost 1 cent to $3.21 per 1,000 cubic feet. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Buy Now Andrew Dye/Journal Andrew Dye/Journal Emergency workers survey damage on Courtney-Huntsville Road after a tornado moved through the area. Tornadoes cut a path of destruction across Iredell, Davie, Yadkin and Stokes counties Wednesday, leaving behind broken trees, a damaged school gym, and dozens of damaged or destroyed houses. A few injuries were reported but no fatalities, and people across the area were expressing thanks for that. Barry Williard, the chief of the Courtney Volunteer Fire Department in Yadkin County, said he and two other firefighters were inside their fire station about 4:30 p.m. on Courtney-Huntsville Road when they saw a tornado coming toward them, from the southwest. “At that time, we took cover in the fire department,” Williard said. “Whenever we looked out, we saw substantial damage across the road (at Courtney Elementary School). It was a pretty good size debris field.” At the school, a tornado struck the school’s gym, knocking down two walls and tearing off its roof, authorities said. Just before the tornado touched down, a group of about 25 people, including students and teachers, took cover inside the school adjacent to the gym, said Keith Vestal, the county emergency management director. No one at the school was injured. “They followed their tornado warning plan, and everything worked well,” Vestal said. The National Weather Service confirmed that tornadoes touched down in southeastern Yadkin County and southwestern Stokes County. The weather service received a report that a funnel cloud, possibly a tornado, touched down six miles northeast of Statesville in Iredell County. There was also an unconfirmed report of a tornado near Monroe in Union County. Three people were injured and 35 houses and other structures were damaged in the Four Corners Road area in northeastern Davie County, where local officials declared a state of emergency, according to Jerry Myers, the county’s emergency management coordinator. Two of the injured were wounded during the storm and one afterward when he cut himself using a chain saw to cut a tree, Myers said, adding that none of the injuries in Davie County was serious. A woman in a mobile home on Baity Road in southeastern Yadkin County was injured when the tornado touched down near Courtney Elementary School, her neighbors said. The woman suffered broken bones and was taken to Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center, the neighbors said. In Stokes County the storm cut a path from the southwest around Pinnacle toward Lawsonville to the northeast, plowing across Sauratown Mountain in the process and snapping off so many trees it looked like part of the mountain had been logged. The worst damage in Stokes County seemed concentrated in an area encompassing Marshall Smith Road, YMCA Camp Road and Cliff View Drive, where a number of mobile homes were damaged, said Stokes County Sheriff Mike Marshall. Those neighborhoods all sit at the foot of the south side of Sauratown Mountain. “So far, I have personally seen about 15 homes that have damage and I’m sure there are more,” Marshall said Wednesday night as he moved around the area checking for damage. “I’m making my way through, trying to get them shelter through emergency management.” On YMCA Camp Road there were three houses destroyed, including two modular homes, Marshall said. “There were several barns that were totally demolished,” he said. A giant oak tree sliced through the kitchen and dining area of a mobile home off Marshall Smith Road, but the renters, Will and Nancy Gambill, got out before the damage when they heard about the tornado warning. “They left and went to Walmart so nobody was at home, but it has got a lot of damage,” said Sandra Smith, the owner of the mobile home. Smith and her husband Stanley were at their house on Gentry Farm Road when the storm hit. “It didn’t hit our house but we have a streak of trees through the woods where it clipped them,” Sandra Smith said. Smith gathered together some relatives and took shelter in her own basement at the height of the storm. “There was a huge roaring noise in the fireplace,” she said. “I looked out and the trees were swaying real bad and it was dark, but we were fine in the basement.” Vickie and Bobby Boyles were in the den of their home on Marshall Smith Road when the storm hit. “The power kept blinking,” Vickie Boyles said. “And the next thing that happened was a racket. We looked at each other and both of us said, ‘What happened?’ We opened the door and there was so much mud on the storm door we couldn’t see out. And he opened the door and everything was gone.” The storm blew away the Boyles’ carport and left it scattered across the yard on the other side of the house. It blew the roof off the den where the couple had been during the storm. A mailbox and the electrical attachment to the house were both ripped away. The whole front of their house was spackled with little bits of insulation. “There’s lots and lots of trees down,” said Maj. Jeff Lemons, Stokes County Sheriff’s Office, who manned traffic control at an intersection on Marshall Smith Road. “I know of several areas where there are trees on houses and on porches. There’s been some barn roofs and outbuilding roofs blown off. I’ve seen a couple of hay barns and outbuildings blown off of their foundations.” Lemons said he was on the other side of Sauratown Mountain when the storm came across and that it “looked like the mountain split the storm.” Damage extended toward Lawsonville on the north side of the mountain, but authorities said it was not as bad there. As the storm made its way into Stokes County it downed trees onto U.S. 52, blocking the southbound lanes until the trees could be cleared away. Yadkin County first responders helped people in 10 damaged houses on Baity Road get out of their homes. The affected residents are staying with their relatives in Yadkin County, authorities said. The American Red Cross was also helping. Courtney Elementary will be closed today because of damage from the tornado. Stokes County schools are on a two-hour delay today, with the start of end-of-grade testing postponed to Friday, school officials said. Duke Energy said about 1,100 customers in Northwest North Carolina were without power about 10:30 p.m. Wednesday. wyoung@wsjournal.com 336-727-7369 @jhintonWSJ Homes destroyed by possible tornado in eastern Iredell At least two homes were destroyed by a possible tornado off Highway 64 in eastern Iredell County near the Davie County line.

Disgusting footage shows a white woman yelling at Hispanic customer Eva Hicks, after they came to blows at Walmart in Centerton, Arkansas. Eva began filming the racist woman after she began yelling abuse at her when she said “excuse me” in an effort to try to get to medicine, which was being blocked by the woman's trolley. As the situation escalated, the woman yells: "Go back to Mexico. Go, go back to wherever you're from" at Eva, before declaring: "This is America." Shocked by what had just happened, Eva then tries to calm the woman down and explain her side exclaiming: "Don't be so rude."

The racist woman eventually walks off after a Walmart employee steps in (Photo: Eva Hicks/Youtube) Eva, who's lived in Centerton for 23 years after moving from Mexico City, told NWA.com : "My feelings are hurt, and it still hurts. But I'm not going to hide. It's not okay. "She started telling me I don't like when people are in my way on every aisle I go, so I responded to that that if she didn't like it, she needed to move away. "You know what, you kill people with kindness. And I believe in that.

Photographer: Daily Gazette file photo In the fight for food dollars in 2016, traditional supermarkets saw their sales drop nearly 6 percent and their market share decline almost 2 percent. Meantime, at non-traditional competitors – dollar stores, drugstores, mass merchandisers and supercenters that also sell groceries – sales rose 2.6 percent while market share grew 1 percent. It’s a “Bizarro World” free-for- all, according to two consultants who presented an hour-long webinar last week on the future of food retailing. Jim Hertel, senior vice president at Willard Bishop, a Chicago-area retail consultant now affiliated with data analytics firm Inmar, called the sales drop at supermarkets “astounding.” He went on to explain that customer traffic had been edging down for years but had been masked by inflation, which helped keep store revenue steady. But as food deflation hit grocers over the last two years, the true loss in the $500 billion industry began to show through. Hertel and Craig Rosenblum, senior director at Willard Bishop, said they borrowed the pop culture phrase “Bizarro World” from the TV sitcom “Seinfeld” (which borrowed it from DC Comics) to explain today’s topsy-turvy environment. They offered slides of headlines as evidence: online icon Amazon pondering 2,000 brick-and-mortar grocery stores; discount behemoth Wal-Mart introducing curb-side grocery pickup; convenience stores relishing new street cred as the supermarket-of- choice for men and Millennials. And where does Bizarro Supergirl go out to eat on a Saturday night? A Philadelphia “grocerant,” a supermarket featuring chef-quality meals, a “happy hour” and live entertainment, according to one Hertel/Rosenblum slide. Given the “unprecedented disruption in food retailing,” the consultants suggested grocers take note of the data they already may have at their fingertips from loyalty programs. While the programs were initiated to lure shoppers with savings, competing on price is no longer enough because there is just too much competition, according to Rosenblum. Added Hertel, “We need to turn the telescope around and put ourselves in the consumer seat and start to understand, ‘How do they make their choices?,’ not how do we want to sell them product. “It’s a change from a product-centric or a company-centric culture to a shopper- or consumer-centric culture.” By better understanding what customers buy, grocers can create offers relevant to individual shoppers, which can “drive conversion and loyalty” and “differentiate your banner/brand,” the consultants said. For the grocer, a higher return on investment – 1.5 times or more – can be expected from digital targeting. “Personalization differentiates against competition,” according to the consultants, who during the webinar mentioned new supermarket competitor Lidl several times. The German limited-assortment grocer – similar to Aldi but with slightly bigger stores – announced just as the webinar began that its U.S. debut will be June 15; 20 stores will open in the Carolinas and Virginia this summer, with 80 more anticipated by mid-2018. The chain will have “significant impact,” Rosenblum said. Marlene Kennedy is a freelance columnist. Opinions expressed in her column are her own and not necessarily the newspaper’s.

A spokesman for that hand-picked panel, Steve Schwarzman, praised Trump as a leader who wants to "do things a lot better in our country, for all Americans." Wait a minute... Steve Schwarzman? Isn't he a billionaire hedge-fund huckster on Wall Street? Yes — and Holy Money Bags! — there's Jamie Dimon, head of scandal-ridden JPMorgan Chase. Working-class champions? Trump's whole "jobs" panel is made up of Wall Street banksters and corporate powers like Walmart that instead are notorious for laying off and ripping off workers. Trump-the-candidate fulminated against such moneyed elites, calling them "responsible for the economic decisions that have robbed our working class." But now, in a spectacular flip-flop as president, he has brought these robbers directly inside his presidency, asking them to be architects of his economic strategy. He’s brought these robbers directly inside his presidency. click to tweet Worse, he's doing this in the name of helping workers. Hello!!! To develop policies beneficial to working stiffs, bring in some working stiffs! But not a single labor advocate is on his policy council, in his Cabinet, or anywhere near his White House. Thus, the so-called "job-creation plan" announced by Trump and his corporate cohorts doesn't create any jobs, but calls instead for — Ta-dah! — deregulating Wall Street. The truth is, these flim-flammers actually want us rubes to believe that "freeing" banksters to return to casino-style speculation and consumer scams will give them more money that they "can" invest in American jobs. Do they think we have sucker wrappers around our heads? Trump's scheme will let banks make a killing, but it doesn't require them to invest in jobs — so they won't. There's a name for this: Fraud.

But while that business model makes plenty of sense, their latest is a bit more questionable: Starting this July, Walmart will be selling the brand's green pickle-flavored ice pops in stores. Dill-icious? Van Houlton's is now selling pickle-flavored popsicles Oh my gherkin! The ice pops are made of pickle brine that the company uses in its other pickle products Boozy: It recommends mixing them into Bloody Mary cocktails According to Delish.com, the company's vice president of sales and marketing, Eric Girard, first got the idea for the item at an Alabama high school baseball game. He said they're actually quite common in the south.  Van Houlton's popsicles are made from the same brine as their pickles, with extra electrolytes added in. 'It's a refreshing treat on a hot day, and an athletic supplement that helps rehydrate and prevent cramps,' the company explains. In addition to suggesting Pickle-Ice as a fun frozen treat, Van Houlton's recommends mixing them into Bloody Mary's and stocking them for athletes. 'Pickle-Ice aids in keeping your body hydrated, balanced, and performing at peak levels,' they say.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Fire up the oven - but not THAT much! Italian eateries start... ANOTHER denim disaster! $445 dress made out of upside-down... Share this article Share Sports staple: It's also recommended for athletes, who sometimes drink pickle juice to stay hydrated and prevent cramps The company also sells individual pickles in snacking to-go bags 'Essential minerals like sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium can be lost during intense workouts leading to muscle cramps and dehydration. Pickle-Ice helps replace these minerals and promotes a balanced body.' They're not making it up. Athletes have actually long drank pickle juice to prevent cramps, since it's packed with sodium, magnesium, and potassium. So for people already planning to drink pickle juice, packing it into a frozen dessert makes sense — though it seems unlikely that Pickle-Ice will catch on with kids.   In addition to coming to Walmart, Pickle-Ice is also available on the company's website and Amazon.

David Huff, Midwest City Police chief, waves from the backseat of a Thunderbirds F-16D prior to a flight with Capt. Erik Gonsalvez, Thunderbird No. 8, team advance pilot/narrator on May 19 at Tinker Air Force Base, Okla. (Air Force photo/Greg L. Davis) Jillian Coleman Staff Writer The United States Air Force Air Demonstration Squadron, more commonly known as the Thunderbirds, headlined the Star Spangled Salute Air Show May 20-21. Part of their tour at Tinker included two media flights with Sarah Klein, Miss Oklahoma 2016, and Midwest City Police Maj. David Huff. Hometown Hero Huff, who in 2014 received the Oklahoma Association of Chiefs of Police Officer of the Year award, has 23 years of service in the force. The major received the honor in recognition of his actions during an incident in June 2013, at a Wal-Mart store in Midwest City. After a man had taken a 2-year-old girl hostage at knife point, threatening violent action, the major shot and killed the man. The child was unharmed. Huff was later awarded the Medal of Valor from then-President Barack Obama. Twelve other law enforcement officers were recipients of the award, the highest national award that can be presented to a public safety officer. Having the opportunity to fly with America’s Ambassadors in Blue, Huff was awestruck as he descended from the F-16 Falcon, the Air Force’s premier multi-role fighter jet. Wide-eyed, the hometown hero described the experience to be “completely unbelievable – a once in a lifetime experience.” Miss Oklahoma 2016, Sarah Klein, adjusts her hair after doffing her helmet before getting out of the in the backseat of a Thunderbirds F-16D May 18 at Tinker Air Force Base, Okla. Klein was flown by Lt. Col. Kevin Walsh, Thunderbirds operations officer, during an orientation flight in which she pulled 9.2 Gs. (Air Force photo/Greg L. Davis) “The Thunderbirds display professionalism unlike anything I’ve ever seen,” he added. “I feel truly honored to be here, and I very much appreciate the opportunity to fly today and for the wonderful hospitality they have given me and my family.” The Thunderbirds perform air shows all over the world, showcasing the pride, precision and professionalism of all of America’s Airmen. Through each hour-long demonstration, the Thunderbirds display the capabilities that all fighter pilots must possess, wowing crowds across the globe. Piloting the No. 8 jet is advance pilot and narrator Capt. Erik Gonsalves, who is in his first season with the esteemed demo squadron. “I’ve flown with various celebrities, but never had the chance to fly with someone as heroic as Maj. Huff,” Gonsalves said. “I was honored to fly with him and inspired by his character, which is not only a reflection of him but his family as well.” 4:00 pm Wed, May 24, 2017 The Tinker Take Off jilliancoleman Related Articles TAFB at 75: Pratt & Whitney TF33 engine profile May 24, 2017 Commentary: The Berlin Airlift: Faith in the future May 24, 2017 Senate confirms Wilson as AF Secretary May 16, 2017 My Account SUBSCRIBE MANAGE ACCOUNT PRIVACY POLICY SUBSCRIBER AGREEMENT Recent Posts Hometown Hero takes flight with Thunderbirds TAFB at 75: Pratt & Whitney TF33 engine profile Commentary: The Berlin Airlift: Faith in the future Senate confirms Wilson as AF Secretary Journal Record ABOUT CONTACT US FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS DOLAN BUSINESS BOOKS LAWYERS WEEKLY BOOKS Copyright © 2017 Tinker Take Off 101 N.

It was a dark night in April 2017 in Nogales, Arizona, along the US-Mexico border. The infamous wall was visible from where I was stopped. I am an Indian-American college student who had been living in Nogales for the past few months studying journalism and education. My heart dropped as I pulled over to the side of the road. "Driver!" a Nogales Police Department (NPD) officer yelled at me through the loud metallic intercom of his vehicle. I didn't understand what was going on, but I tried to remain calm. I knew I could be shot. I didn't know how to respond since the officer's statement wasn't really a question or a command, so I just shouted, "Yes?" out the window. In my driver-side mirror, I saw an agent creeping toward my car with his blinding, bright flashlight and gun pointed directly at me. Two more officers stood on the other side of my car with their flashlights and guns drawn, too. I didn't understand what was going on, but I tried to remain calm. I knew I could be shot. Just a few minutes walk away from where I was pulled over, in October 2012, US Border Patrol agents shot and killed 16-year-old Jose Antonio Elena Rodriguez through the wall in Mexico. I thought of this as I sat in my car, surrounded by armed police officers. I had become subject to what Attorney General Jeff Sessions would call a few days later the "Trump era" of immigration enforcement and border security during a visit to Nogales in mid-April. There was an eerie premonition that what happened to Elena Rodriguez would happen with more frequency under a Trump administration poised to fortify the border, as Sessions made quite clear, even more than it already is. "Turn off your vehicle!" an officer shouted. I turned it off. "Show me your hands!" the agent on the driver's side yelled. I stuck my hands out the window. As the officer on the driver's side got closer he put away his gun, reached his hand through the window to unlock the door and opened it. "Step out of the vehicle and put your hands up." As soon as I stood up, the cop grabbed my hands, forced handcuffs on, and walked me to his police car. A few minutes earlier, I had been pulled over for driving without my headlights on. The officer told me he was going to let me go with a warning and I drove off. I then realized I forgot to wait for the officer to return my license and registration. That day, I had been on a long reporting trip in Mexico and was extremely tired. I slowed down, knowing they would pull me over again, and they did. In the US-Mexico borderlands and to the border enforcement apparatus, what I considered a mistake was interpreted as a blatant act of aggression that resulted in me being detained at gunpoint. They put me in the back of their police car, which was cramped, with little leg room. The tight, cold metal of the handcuffs felt uncomfortable on my wrists. As the police searched my car, I thought of the countless police shootings that topped news reports over the last few years. I thought about how my parents would react if anything happened to me. The day after Sessions' Nogales trip, I decided to call the NPD to file a complaint for excessive use of force, but the supervising officer said that there was no policy broken and that they had every right to draw weapons. "That area is very close to the border. When you took off, the officer had no idea what was going on," the supervising officer said. "It could have been drugs; it could have been illegal aliens." His justification for the NPD's use of force sounded eerily similar to the comments made by Sessions: "It is also here, along this border, that transnational gangs like MS-13 and international cartels flood our country with drugs and leave death and violence in their wake. And it is here that criminal aliens and the coyotes and the document-forgers seek to overthrow our system of lawful immigration." Sessions painted a picture in which everyone living in the borderlands [is a] criminal drug [smuggler]. Indeed, that rhetoric has long translated into policy. This was a place where non-citizens, Native Americans, Latinos and Black people were guilty and must be proven innocent. Homeland Security is the only federal department sanctioned by Washington to ethnically profile. The Trump era will inevitably lead to more instances of excessive use of force by law enforcement in the borderlands as immigrants continue to be criminalized. Racial Profiling and Police Overreach The Trump era will inevitably lead to more instances of excessive use of force by law enforcement in the borderlands as immigrants continue to be criminalized. During Sessions' speech, he ordered that federal prosecutors charge undocumented immigrants with a felony (previously a misdemeanor) "if they unlawfully enter or attempt to enter a second time." Depending on the budget, the next few years will likely see a growth in the militarization of the border through the hiring of additional Border Patrol officers, a larger and taller wall, more motion sensor cameras, surveillance towers and other security infrastructure. This will be on top of an already historic 25-year growth of the border enforcement apparatus, which now has more agents, barriers and technologies at its disposal than at any other time in history. Local police are already, in a way, de facto Border Patrol agents through programs like Operation Stonegarden, which is a federal grant program by the Department of Homeland Security that provides funding to local police on the border for additional personnel, overtime pay and new equipment to help "secure the border" and "prevent terrorism." Through this program, NPD has received millions of dollars to fund communications equipment, infrared sensors and overtime pay. But with more resources, incidents of police overreach and racial profiling become more frequent. At around 2 am on Saturday, February 25, NPD officers entered a Nogales home without a warrant to investigate what appeared to the police to be an out-of-control bonfire in the backyard. The police busted the lip of 20-year-old Adaly Collelmo with the door as they forced their way inside. Four officers entered the home and Collelmo reached into his pocket to grab his cell phone to film the event, but the agents thought he was pulling out a gun and drew their weapons. The police also tackled Collelmo's 16-year-old cousin to the ground and pointed their weapons at his 7-year-old brother. "We were all scared," Collelmo told Nogales International. "To be honest, I thought I was going to die when they pointed their guns at my face."  Nogales Police Department officers greet members of the III% United Patriots militia at the Nogales Walmart parking lot in March 2017. (Photo: Arielle Zionts) These events clash sharply with how NPD treats an armed militia group named the III% United Patriots (3UP), which frequently patrols the US-Mexico border near Nogales, armed with military gear and assault rifles. In March 2017, the 3UP were spotted in friendly interaction with the NPD at the Nogales Walmart parking lot while openly carrying their weapons. This event closely resembles another instance captured by journalist Shane Bauer in April 2016 when the armed militia members were guarding their truck in the Walmart parking lot while others were inside buying supplies. 3UP members were approached by NPD and told to put down their weapons. After militia members explained that they act as the "eyes and ears of the Border Patrol," an officer said to them, "It takes balls to do what you guys do out there.... Thank you." When a group of white men armed with military-grade assault rifles casually stood in a Walmart parking lot three miles from the border, NPD did not assume the militia was there for reasons related to drug trafficking or migration. The police did not draw any weapons or handcuff anyone. The contrast between the easy-going interactions between NPD and an armed militia group and the way NPD treated other Nogales residents and me highlights the extent to which Brown people are criminalized in the US-Mexico borderlands. Add to this the countless incidents of undocumented people chased, beaten and arrested every day by the US Border Patrol, and the thousands of cases of short-term detention abuse from deprivation of food, to ice-cold holding cells, to rude and dehumanizing language -- and a stark line of division emerges between those supported and enabled by law enforcement, and those targeted and traumatized. After about 10 minutes of searching, an officer walked back to the police vehicle I was detained in and opened the door. They didn't find drugs or migrants in my car. They didn't find any terrorists (indeed, no known person with a terrorist affiliation has ever crossed the border). "Alright, you can step out. I'm going to take the handcuffs off," the officer said. I stepped outside and the officer moved behind me. "Now after I uncuff you, you're not going to come at me or anything, right? You're not going to attack me?" I thought this question strange, considering that [I'd] been fully cooperating with them this whole time, and that they were the ones with the guns, not me. "No," I responded. He uncuffed me, and after searching my backpack, the officers finally let me go with just a written warning to remember to always drive with my headlights on. Before I finally walked away, the officer said to me, "We're on the border. A lot of stuff goes down and that's why we had guns on you." This statement sounded like an admission of guilt, like he knew their use of force was excessive and this was an attempt to justify it. But proximity to the border has long been enough to justify some of the most egregious acts of violence and cruelty from one group of human beings to another. And in the coming years under the "Trump era," we can only expect there will be more. In the written version of his announcement, Sessions declared, "It is here, on this sliver of land, where we first take our stand against this filth." The police let me go, handed me my license and registration, and I walked back to my car and drove off, wondering who would be next. Copyright, Truthout. May not be reprinted without permission.

If the answer is Truthout, support our work today with a tax-deductible donation! Three cop cars with their sirens blazing were coming fast behind me. It was a dark night in April 2017 in Nogales, Arizona, along the US-Mexico border. The infamous wall was visible from where I was stopped. I am an Indian-American college student who had been living in Nogales for the past few months studying journalism and education. My heart dropped as I pulled over to the side of the road. "Driver!" a Nogales Police Department (NPD) officer yelled at me through the loud metallic intercom of his vehicle. I didn't understand what was going on, but I tried to remain calm. I knew I could be shot. I didn't know how to respond since the officer's statement wasn't really a question or a command, so I just shouted, "Yes?" out the window. In my driver-side mirror, I saw an agent creeping toward my car with his blinding, bright flashlight and gun pointed directly at me. Two more officers stood on the other side of my car with their flashlights and guns drawn, too. I didn't understand what was going on, but I tried to remain calm. I knew I could be shot. Just a few minutes walk away from where I was pulled over, in October 2012, US Border Patrol agents shot and killed 16-year-old Jose Antonio Elena Rodriguez through the wall in Mexico. I thought of this as I sat in my car, surrounded by armed police officers. I had become subject to what Attorney General Jeff Sessions would call a few days later the "Trump era" of immigration enforcement and border security during a visit to Nogales in mid-April. There was an eerie premonition that what happened to Elena Rodriguez would happen with more frequency under a Trump administration poised to fortify the border, as Sessions made quite clear, even more than it already is. "Turn off your vehicle!" an officer shouted. I turned it off. "Show me your hands!" the agent on the driver's side yelled. I stuck my hands out the window. As the officer on the driver's side got closer he put away his gun, reached his hand through the window to unlock the door and opened it. "Step out of the vehicle and put your hands up." As soon as I stood up, the cop grabbed my hands, forced handcuffs on, and walked me to his police car. A few minutes earlier, I had been pulled over for driving without my headlights on. The officer told me he was going to let me go with a warning and I drove off. I then realized I forgot to wait for the officer to return my license and registration. That day, I had been on a long reporting trip in Mexico and was extremely tired. I slowed down, knowing they would pull me over again, and they did. In the US-Mexico borderlands and to the border enforcement apparatus, what I considered a mistake was interpreted as a blatant act of aggression that resulted in me being detained at gunpoint. They put me in the back of their police car, which was cramped, with little leg room. The tight, cold metal of the handcuffs felt uncomfortable on my wrists. As the police searched my car, I thought of the countless police shootings that topped news reports over the last few years. I thought about how my parents would react if anything happened to me. The day after Sessions' Nogales trip, I decided to call the NPD to file a complaint for excessive use of force, but the supervising officer said that there was no policy broken and that they had every right to draw weapons. "That area is very close to the border. When you took off, the officer had no idea what was going on," the supervising officer said. "It could have been drugs; it could have been illegal aliens." His justification for the NPD's use of force sounded eerily similar to the comments made by Sessions: "It is also here, along this border, that transnational gangs like MS-13 and international cartels flood our country with drugs and leave death and violence in their wake. And it is here that criminal aliens and the coyotes and the document-forgers seek to overthrow our system of lawful immigration." Sessions painted a picture in which everyone living in the borderlands [is a] criminal drug [smuggler]. Indeed, that rhetoric has long translated into policy. This was a place where non-citizens, Native Americans, Latinos and Black people were guilty and must be proven innocent. Homeland Security is the only federal department sanctioned by Washington to ethnically profile. The Trump era will inevitably lead to more instances of excessive use of force by law enforcement in the borderlands as immigrants continue to be criminalized. Racial Profiling and Police Overreach The Trump era will inevitably lead to more instances of excessive use of force by law enforcement in the borderlands as immigrants continue to be criminalized. During Sessions' speech, he ordered that federal prosecutors charge undocumented immigrants with a felony (previously a misdemeanor) "if they unlawfully enter or attempt to enter a second time." Depending on the budget, the next few years will likely see a growth in the militarization of the border through the hiring of additional Border Patrol officers, a larger and taller wall, more motion sensor cameras, surveillance towers and other security infrastructure. This will be on top of an already historic 25-year growth of the border enforcement apparatus, which now has more agents, barriers and technologies at its disposal than at any other time in history. Local police are already, in a way, de facto Border Patrol agents through programs like Operation Stonegarden, which is a federal grant program by the Department of Homeland Security that provides funding to local police on the border for additional personnel, overtime pay and new equipment to help "secure the border" and "prevent terrorism." Through this program, NPD has received millions of dollars to fund communications equipment, infrared sensors and overtime pay. But with more resources, incidents of police overreach and racial profiling become more frequent. At around 2 am on Saturday, February 25, NPD officers entered a Nogales home without a warrant to investigate what appeared to the police to be an out-of-control bonfire in the backyard.

The news, the media; they've both become almost bad words in the last few months, making ‘fake news’ the worst insult of all. It's a name we're called every day. Those two words specifically have crept into the vocabularies of many Americans. We're trying to find out why. It's in this special report from the 9&10 News producing team, Fake News: Separating Fact from Fiction. "I'd like to think, well, every member of the public is smart and would see through these things," says Dr. John Hartman, retired Central Michigan University journalism professor. You've probably seen it, even if you didn't know. Fake news has been around since tabloids produced Bat Boy and Big Foot, but the age of social media and the internet has added fuel to fake news. It helped pass off a picture of ice on the Straits of Mackinac as real.  It's simple: fake news is news that's made up. But it's more than that, it's made up purposely. That purpose isn't always good. “The damage to society. The damage to school children when they find out the people they would like to believe in and people they should believe in are not telling them the truth. I think the damage to our society by this fake news, this blatant lying is going on by both sides, is something very harmful to our society, very harmful to our institutions,” says Dr. John Hartman. Cadillac High School civics teacher Cody Mallory says, “Fake news isn't new, it's propaganda. That's always been a concern. Whether it's fake news or getting it from these different question and answer sites online. It's always been part of the educational process, that weeding out.” Maybe you remember it by what it was called in school: yellow journalism. “Journalism has always been about truth telling. I think a lot of us, you know, I got into journalism more than 50 years ago to tell the truth, to disseminate to the public what is truly going on. So whenever there is a falsity being disseminated to the public, it's up to journalists to step up and correct the record,” says Dr. Hartman. One of the bigger recent fake news stories was ‘Pizzagate’, perpetuated big-time by Infowars and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. It was about an alleged link between hacked emails from former DNC chair John Podesta and a child abuse ring being run out of the basement of a D.C. pizza joint. That ended with a man barging into that restaurant with a loaded gun. Fake news, a real restaurant, with real people and a real gun. How big of a problem is it? According to the Pew Research Center, if you take ten people about eight are seeing fake or inaccurate news. Five are seeing it regularly. Four aren't totally sure they'd be able to recognize fake news. A little less than half of that admit to sharing it, whether they knew it was fake or not at the time. Fake news doesn't just fool adults. With students’ easy access to social media, does that impact their concept of current events or if it's skewing it at all? “Definitely is,” says Mallory. “Because there's so much information available to us at our fingertips that I think what it does is breed a culture of scanning headlines and not really looking in-depth at stuff. I'm guilty of that, everyone's guilty of that. I had a girl, she swore that because she saw a video on YouTube that Walmart had some type of weapon storage under all the Walmarts in the country. She was very convinced of it. I don't even know how you respond to that.” It has teachers hammering home the idea that not all sources are created equal. “Sometimes you see a questionable citation on a student's work and research or something to that effect," explains Anne Koschmider, Cadillac High School social studies teacher. "Sometimes kids will come and say, ‘I read this online, do you think it's true?’ I always encourage them to follow their sources. Make sure that they're geared toward academic sources, scholarly journals, as opposed to a personal website or a blog.” It's also created a climate where local news has been lumped together with 24-hour cable news. We have eight hours worth of shows to fill a day, not 24. While we can draw on network resources, all decisions made on the stories we cover, absolutely everything we bring to the viewers of Northern Michigan comes from dedicated journalists right here at 9&10 News. We work to bring you both sides of the issue, no matter how controversial the topic may be, because there are always two sides to every story. “In fact, we used to say about journalists is that you were doing a good job if you had both sides mad at you,” explains Dr. Hartman.  How do you spot fake news? We've found some of the things you can do to spot and avoid it. - Consider the source:  Is it a source you recognize and trust? Is it coming from a blog or legitimate news website? You may need to do some independent research of your sources to make sure you're not getting fooled. - Read past the headline: Headlines are meant to grab your attention, not embellish or exaggerate the truth. Fake news is more than just clickbait; it's lies. - Check the author: Is the person who wrote the story unbiased or do they have their own agenda? Are there other trustworthy sources to back up the claim? - Check the date the story was written. - Make sure it's not satire, a joke or an opinion piece. - Check your biases: Only you choose what news you get to see. If you only trust sources that do nothing but reinforce own opinion, you're not getting the entire story. It goes the other way too; fake news isn't just news you disagree with. Facts are facts, regardless if you believe in them or not. After all that, if you're still unsure about the validity of a story, contact the website, author or ask an expert. Check out this list of fake news sites to watch out for. If you think you see fake news on Facebook, here’s how you can report it. Simply click on the upper right hand corner of the post and select the “report this post” option. From there, Facebook will prompt you to select a reason. Select the option that reads “It’s a fake news story.” Facebook will ask what you would like to do with the post. Select “Mark this post as fake news.” All of us at 9&10 News work in this business for a reason. Our crews are out all over Northern Michigan, talking with real people to get real stories that matter to you. That kind of work still happens, and there's nothing fake about it. “The fact of the matter is, being a journalist is not an easy job. When you're reporting the truth, sometimes you're going to offend people's sensibilities and people's belief systems,” says Dr. Hartman.  Mallory adds, “I think that if you don't have faith in traditional media, that's a scary world to live in, because where do you get your information then?” 9&10's Katie Boomgaard, producer Chris Clor, assistant news director Dan Firnbach, executive web producer Karie Herringa, photojournalist Derrick Larr and executive producer Jamie Valentine contributed to this special report.  Latest NewsMore>> Cadillac City Council Approve Over $1 Million Street Repair Project Cadillac City Council Approve Over $1 Million Street Repair Project Posted: Wednesday, May 24 2017 8:27 PM EDT2017-05-25 00:27:37 GMT Updated: Thursday, May 25 2017 1:34 AM EDT2017-05-25 05:34:39 GMT The Cadillac City Council paved the way for more major road repairs, approving more than $1 million in what they say are much-needed projects.  The Cadillac City Council paved the way for more major road repairs, approving more than $1 million in what they say are much-needed projects.  Mesick Consolidated Schools Hold Forum to Discuss Funding Alternatives Mesick Consolidated Schools Hold Forum to Discuss Funding Alternatives Posted: Thursday, May 25 2017 12:23 AM EDT2017-05-25 04:23:30 GMT Updated: Thursday, May 25 2017 12:23 AM EDT2017-05-25 04:23:30 GMT “The thing of it is, there's never enough money to stretch.” “The thing of it is, there's never enough money to stretch.” Representative Bill Huizenga, Senator Debbie Stabenow Respond to American Healthcare Act Representative Bill Huizenga, Senator Debbie Stabenow Respond to American Healthcare Act Posted: Thursday, May 25 2017 12:10 AM EDT2017-05-25 04:10:14 GMT Updated: Thursday, May 25 2017 12:10 AM EDT2017-05-25 04:10:14 GMT Following the Congressional Budget Office’s assessment of the revised American Healthcare Act, many lawmakers are responding.  Following the Congressional Budget Office’s assessment of the revised American Healthcare Act, many lawmakers are responding.  Senators Debbie Stabenow, Gary Peters Introduce Bill for Great Lakes Pipelines Senators Debbie Stabenow, Gary Peters Introduce Bill for Great Lakes Pipelines Posted: Wednesday, May 24 2017 11:59 PM EDT2017-05-25 03:59:23 GMT Updated: Wednesday, May 24 2017 11:59 PM EDT2017-05-25 03:59:23 GMT Debbie Stabenow, along with Senator Gary Peters introduced a bill that would hold some pipelines in the Great Lakes to stricter standards.

If you'd like to learn more... - A A + Listen Police say an Ontario murder suspect who has been on the run for almost a month in connection with the killing of his girlfriend has been spotted in Tennessee and is believed to be heading to Mexico. Waterloo Regional Police responded to a 911 call at 38 Country Hill Dr. around 3 a.m. April 28 in Kitchener, Ont., where they said they found the body of 22-year-old Melinda Vasilije suffering from multiple stab wounds after a “targeted” attack. Story continues below Police said Vasilije’s boyfriend of about a year, 24-year-old Ager Hasan of Hamilton, was the lead suspect in her death and is wanted on a Canada-wide warrant for second-degree murder and breach of recognizance. READ MORE: ‘I did it’: Police investigating Reddit post describing Ontario woman’s murder With the help of Hamilton police, Waterloo officers spoke to friends of Hasan on April 28 and determined he had fled the province in a black 2016 Honda HR-V with Ontario licence plate BPKT509. Police immediately connected with American law enforcement agencies, the Canada Border Services Agency and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. It was then determined Hasan had crossed the border undetected at around 5:45 a.m. Hours later at around 10 a.m. April 28, State Police in Erie County, Pa., said they observed Hasan on surveillance footage in a Walmart parking lot steal a Pennsylvania licence plate and affix it to his car in place of his Ontario plate. Waterloo police announced Wednesday they received a tip from U.S. authorities that Hasan had been spotted at a truck stop off Interstate 40 in Hurricane Mills, Tennessee, around 8:15 p.m. on May 20. Last seen in Tennessee area May 20 in black Honda HR-V with Ontario or Pennsylvania plates. May be headed to Mexico. Call police with info. pic.twitter.com/FP4bcDDKqS — Waterloo Reg. Police (@WRPSToday) May 24, 2017 “We did receive information that a person had a conversation with someone who they determined to be Ager Hasan,” Waterloo Regional Police Insp. Mike Haffner told Global News Wednesday. “Mr. Hasan did advise this person that he had plans to head towards Texas, possibly in an attempt to cross the border.” Haffner said it’s believed Hasan is driving the same Honda HR-V with either Ontario or Pennsylvania licence plates, but investigators have not been able to determine that with 100 per cent certainty. “Right now our investigators are working with Tennessee authorities to determine any surveillance video — anything that may be available to continue the investigation,” Haffner said, adding officers are working with U.S. authorities from a wide variety of local and national law enforcement agencies. “Obviously our main concern, our main focus, is either to locate Mr. Hasan and either encourage him to turn himself in to a U.S. law enforcement station or have U.S. authorities arrest him down there.” Haffner said Hasan’s family or friends in Canada may have had contact with him and if so investigators are encouraging them to urge him to surrender. He added friends and family had been cooperating “positively” with police. “We’re thankful that someone in the United States reached out to us and provided us with information that he was located in Tennessee,” Haffner said. “But he still has connections with friends and family and relatives and we would just hope that the information gets sent to him properly and that he makes the right decision and turns himself in.” Haffner said Hasan’s appearance has changed since April 28, in contrast to the description police initially gave of him, adding that he now has “shaved, short hair.” Reddit post Days after Vasilije’s death, a post on the website Reddit emerged that appeared to describe her killing in vivid detail and was purported to be written by Hasan himself. “I understand the early judgements made by society, distancing myself makes it seem like I am trying to escape a crime. I’m not. I’m only trying to give myself some space and fully take in what happened before I turn myself in,” the May 2 post read. “The fact is no one is more destroyed than I am. She was more than a girlfriend, a soon to be fiance, she was my everything. What happened that night was nothing but tragic.” The post said the relationship between the suspect and the victim had been the first serious one for them both. It said they had travelled the world together, their families had met and they had been talking seriously about getting married and having children. “Melinda and I got into an argument via text and our relationship ended. I went to her apartment that day, to try and talk,” the post read. “As I’m getting ready to leave she asks me if I had done anything with any other girls while we were on break or anytime we were on break. I told her we needed to be honest and said yes and told her about it.” “She started freaking out. Wouldn’t say a word and just kept slapping me with tears in her eyes. Slaps turned into hits. I told her I was sorry but if she didn’t stop I’d do something back. She didn’t stop. I then stupidly pushed her, harder than I expected. She fell against the sink.” The author of the post claimed it was the “first time” they had ever done something physically “violent” to the victim, adding he had apologized but she then told them to leave, then grabbed a knife and came at him “in full force, aiming towards my face.” “I tell her to stop. She doesn’t, I tried grabbing the knife but ended up cutting my hands. After a few cuts I lost it. I freaked out, I was scared and in a state of shock. Never in a hundred years did I think she would use a knife against me,” the post said. “Out of shock and fear I grab one. I hit her with it, almost blindly. A few times. I didn’t know what happened. I was confused, shocked and scared.” The poster said they didn’t intend for the incident to happen and left thinking “she just passed out.” Photos posted on Reddit on May 2, 2017 appear to show Melinda Vasilije and Ager Hasan throughout their relationship.

I didn’t [know] for sure she had died until the next day,” he said. “I honestly had no intentions of ever doing that to her, I was protecting myself.” The author of the post also referred to always keeping a passport in his car and claims to have driven directly to the U.S. with only $200 in his pocket to “get away for a few days before turning myself in or killing myself.” “It was out of fear and protecting myself alongside shock. I’m sorry, to everyone. Especially Melinda’s family,” the author said. “I know it will not will be accepted but know I didn’t mean anything bad to happened that night when I went there. Rest in peace my beautiful. I hope you forgive me in the after life.” The post also included screenshots of a text message conversation purported to be between the two and photos of them as a couple. Waterloo Regional Police said Wednesday they were unable to comment on the authenticity of the post because it is “evidence,” but said that it was being evaluated by officers. “For us to comment on it would be somewhat inappropriate although investigators have looked at it and they are investigating it but to speak to the validity or the author of that post would be something that eventually could up in court,” Haffner said. “Ultimately our goal and our focus is to locate Mr. Hasan as soon as we can. That’s what we’ve been doing since April 28, although difficult because the U.S. is quite vast, we’ve been getting great cooperation from our partners down in the U.S.” Looking for Ager Mohsin Hasan, 24, in relation to suspicious death investigation of Kitchener woman, 22.

See Offers News Posted Yesterday at 4:41 PM Updated May 24 increase font size Skowhegan stitching company expands with factory outlet selling mosquito, tick and black fly repellent items Stitching Specialties LLC and Dog Not Gone Visibility Products now on sale at the Dane Avenue factory. By Doug HarlowStaff Writer Follow on Twitter Email Writer 207-612-2367 Share Comment Read Article SKOWHEGAN — Bill and Julie Swain have come a long way with their Stitching Specialties LLC and Dog Not Gone Visibility Products since they started operations in 2005 in their home in Kingfield. The couple bought the former Dirigo Stitching Co. factory in Skowhegan in 2014, and by last year, their products for pets and people were being shipped to Wal-Mart stores all across New England. Citing walk-in demand for their product line — Dog Not Gone tick and mosquito-repelling outerwear for dogs and humans — the Swains last week opened a factory outlet store at the building on Dane Avenue across from North Elementary School. Owner Julie Swain fits a safety vest on a dog mannequin Wednesday beside many products sold at the new Dog Not Gone factory outlet store inside the Maine Stitching Specialties company in Skowhegan. Staff photo by David Leaming Search photos available for purchase: Photo Store → “People are always coming in asking about the tick-repelling products and the American flags — that’s been a really big seller, especially lately with Memorial Day and the Fourth of July coming up next month,” Julie Swain said from the store Wednesday. The ticks are really bad in Maine this year, she said, and people are worried. The store sells caps, hats, scarves, bandannas and vests — all treated with a special solution called Permethrin that is added during the manufacture of the fabric — and gaiters made of a socklike fabric with a Velcro closure that is worn over the pant leg to keep ticks from climbing in and up. “It’s amazing how effective they are. It’s almost like it’s too good to be true,” she said of the bug repellent and visibility products for people, dogs, cats and horses. “The baseball hats have been huge. Not only do they repel ticks, but they repel mosquitoes and back flies. We do things for the top and the bottom — of you.” Julie Swain said the prices at the factory outlet are lower than prices listed on their website and are currently 25 percent off. She said the Permethrin is woven into the fabric and is insoluble, so it doesn’t come off on a person or a pet. The store is open from 8 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. Monday through Thursday. Bill Swain, speaking by cellphone Wednesday from the road, said Permethrin is safe for people and pets. He said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention consider the chemical to pose virtually no risk and recommends the products for pregnant women and children to avoid insect bites. The new line of apparel under the brand name of No Fly Designs now will offer superior tick and insect protection for every outdoor activity, he said. Bill Swain said that,with the manufacturing of the products in the factory space upstairs, they decided to use a vacant office on the ground floor as a retail store. He said the outlet store has all of the products that are carried at retail and big-box stores. “We have a number of retailers who carry our products, but no single retailer carries them all,” he said. “They either have our pet line, or our people line, or parts of it, but never the whole thing. So we said we could display all of our products in our own store.” Swain said local stores, including Campbell’s True Value, carry some of their products, as does Renys, Paris Farmers Union, Blue Seal Stores, some Tractor Supply stores and 19 Wal-Mart stores. He said sales have increased at a pace reflecting the news that ticks have become a problem in Maine. “We’ve seen a significant upturn, especially in our human apparel items. The increased presence of ticks virtually everywhere in Maine now has really got the interest growing in our products,” he said.

Rodger Mallison rmallison@star-telegram.com Texas May 24, 2017 3:17 PM Trump border wall would cut through rare wetlands in parched Presidio By Gordon Dickson gdickson@star-telegram.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story PRESIDIO Terry Bishop, a lifelong farmer, decided a few years ago to convert about 10.5 acres of property that he owns along the U.S.-Mexico border into wetlands. The gesture was a favor to his hometown, Presidio, which needed property near the border where it could lay a pipe and discharge treated water from a nearby municipal plant into the Rio Grande. But it was also a way for Bishop to give something back to the Earth, which has been so good to him and his family over the years. In addition to growing alfalfa, Bishop, 63, is an amateur bird watcher. He admires the migratory animals of various shapes and colors that flock to his wetlands each day and flap their feathers in the shallow water. It is truly an oasis of greenery in an otherwise punishing desert terrain. But Bishop worries about what would happen to the river if the Trump administration builds a border wall perhaps 20 feet high or taller separating Presidio from the Mexican city of Ojinaga, just across the river. Such a wall would essentially put up a giant barrier on the southern end of Bishop’s wetlands, which he thinks would affect the health of the river and unnecessarily disrupt animal migration patterns. “I like the variety of birds you can see. I like how they make all these different noises,” Bishop said. “There used to be places like this up and down the river. There just aren’t anymore.” Security a priority Others say the health of the river is secondary to stopping drug smugglers from crossing illegally, regardless of how it may affect wildlife, flooding or private property. Helen Marie Jones is Republican chairwoman for Kinney County, one of just a handful of counties touching the U.S.-Mexico border that consistently vote Republican in local elections and supported Trump in the 2016 presidential election. She lives more than 200 miles east of Presidio, but she expressed sentiments that Presidio residents often hear from neighboring towns to justify wall construction. “We want the wall, 100 percent,” said Jones, 80, a retired rancher who lives in Brackettville, which is about 20 miles north of the border. “The drug cartels are still a big problem. I have helicopters flying over my house all the time,” she said. “Some of the farmers have issues with [possibly losing] their land [for a wall]. They don’t want to go through eminent domain. That’s understandable. But the security of the border is very important. It’s a big problem.” Hottest place in Texas Presidio, located just west of Big Bend Ranch State Park, is surrounded by beautiful mountains and extremely dry land, other than a thin ribbon of greenery that drapes each side of the river. The city of 5,000 is often the hottest place in Texas (and occasionally the entire United States) — and the nearest Wal-Mart is 160 miles away in Pecos. There is no wall separating it from Ojinaga, except chain-link fencing around a few acres of federal property that make up the region’s lone port of entry — the only place between Fort Hancock (near El Paso) and Del Rio, which are roughly 375 miles apart, where a car can cross the border. Although longtime residents say it has been common over the years for undocumented immigrants to cross the river, it’s less common today because there are far more decent-paying jobs available in Mexico than in years past, said Jose Portillo, Presidio’s city administrator. This is a view of Presidio, which is on the United States border with Mexico. Rodger Mallison rmallison@star-telegram.com Neighboring Ojinaga is just as remote as Presidio. South of the border, the nearest place of size is Chihuahua City, about 150 miles away. A federal proposal to build a border fence — similar to those in El Paso and Laredo — has been debated in Presidio for more than a decade. The measure is widely opposed by area residents and local officials, Portillo said. The Presidio City Council has formally opposed such a wall since 2009. City leaders value their business contacts and personal friendships in Ojinaga and say they believe a wall would harm those relations while also failing to stop illegal immigration. “You can sneeze in Presidio and Ojinaga catches a cold,” Portillo said. “That’s how intertwined we are.” Challenges for contractors Presidio is but one example of the challenges contractors will face regarding issues such as wildlife and flooding as they design a wall stretching the length of the border, said Michael Evangelista-Ysasaga, a Fort Worth businessman. His PennaGroup is among the companies that have notified the federal government that they wish to take part in the design of the wall. The federal government is expected to soon narrow its list of 230 prospective contractors to just a handful. The finalists would then be asked to build prototypes of their vision for a border wall. Contractors who have made the cut have been asked not to publicly discuss their selection. “Despite the fact that birds can fly over a fence, they actually don’t like to do that,” said Evangelista-Ysasaga, who added that he has been studying biological, ecological and hydrological issues related to the border area and the Rio Grande to prepare for the wall project. Terry Bishop developed the B.J. Bishop Wetlands in Presidio. Rodger Mallison rmallison@star-telegram.com   Wall of contention   Introduction Part one Presidio Part two Big Bend Part three Boquillas Part four Eagle Pass   The challenge is to create a wall that looks uniform from one end of the nearly 2,000-mile-long border to the other, while also designing a structure flexible enough to meet the specific challenges of various terrains, he said. “The challenge is trying to figure out what kind of back-of-the-house engineering we can have that will sustain a front-of-the-house project,” he said. “Anybody who tells you the design is going to have zero impact on the ecosystem is lying to you. Our challenge is to minimize the impact.” In Presidio, the general feeling among residents is that stepped-up enforcement can be accomplished by deploying better surveillance cameras and other technology, and by making better use of Border Patrol agents, several residents said Ask people on the streets, and most will say a border wall would be a tremendous waste of money and a slap in the face to their neighbors. “I hope they don’t build it,” said Elida Martinez, who works the front desk at the Three Palms Inn, one of just two small hotels in Presidio. She remembers crossing the river at one of several unofficial crossings to visit relatives in Chihuahua as a child, back when residents on both sides of the river crossed the boundary without thinking twice. “We are one community,” she said. Revisiting NAFTA That’s not to say Presidio residents don’t see the need to change border laws, not only related to immigration but also to the movement of goods. A fair amount of support exists for revisiting provisions of the North American Free Trade Agreement, Portillo said. “People come from Mexico to buy shoes in the U.S., and when they go back to Mexico they throw away their old shoes [so they can wear their new shoes] and avoid paying tariffs of 15 to 18 percent,” he said. “But you can buy a TV in Mexico and bring it back across to the U.S. with no tariff.” Presidio’s remoteness obviously hurts its economy. Retail jobs are scarce, and goods can be expensive because shipping costs add to the price tag. Presidio sits along the Rio Grande on the U.S.-Mexico border west of Big Bend. Rodger Mallison rmallison@star-telegram.com For example, Presidio motorists typically pay about 50 cents a gallon more for gasoline than residents of metro areas such as Dallas-Fort Worth. Tourism is one of the area’s largest industries, with a handful of locally owned restaurants and shops drawing whatever business they can from motorists heading to and from Big Bend National Park, which is 50 miles to the east. Travelers usually arrive in Presidio on Farm Road 170, sometimes called the River Road. It is designated part of the state’s Texas Mountain Trail system, and it is a favorite of hikers, campers and touring motorcyclists who want to visit the national park, as well as Big Bend Ranch State Park. Making the river healthy And, perhaps not surprisingly, Presidio has recently become a fairly well-known destination for those in the bird-watching community. People come from hundreds of miles away to look at the white pelicans and other creatures bathing in the new wetlands, Bishop said. The wetlands area is partly created out of the former Loma Paloma Golf Course, which was owned by Bishop’s family but destroyed in a 2008 flood and closed permanently. It would seem pointless, Bishop said, to spend millions of dollars on a wall that likely wouldn’t stop illegal immigration but that would cause a major setback in efforts to make the Rio Grande a clean, vibrant river. “The river is unhealthy. We have a low water volume. The water is silty and salty. We are trying to make it healthy again,” he said. “In some places, we may need a fence, but in most places, including here, it’s not necessary. “Governments, whether local or federal or whatever, can be heavy-handed. All we’re saying is, be gentle.” Gordon Dickson: 817-390-7796, @gdickson A sign warns hikers to carry one quart of water for every hour of hiking on the East Rancherias Loop Trail in Big Bend Ranch State Park.

(Philip Montgomery for The New York Times) The Trump Administration ProPublica’s ongoing coverage of the 45th President. This story was co-published with The New York Times Magazine. The Townhouse on High Seas Court in the Cove Village development, in the Baltimore suburb of Essex, was not exactly the Cape Cod retreat that its address implied: It was a small unit looking onto a parking lot, the windows of its two bedrooms so high and narrow that a child would have had to stand on a chair to see out of them. But to Kamiia Warren, who moved into the townhouse in 2004, it was a refuge, and a far cry from the East Baltimore neighborhood where she grew up. “I mean, there were bunny rabbits all hopping around,” she told me recently. In the townhouse next door lived an older woman with whom Warren became friendly, even doing her grocery shopping once in a while. But over the course of a few months, the woman started acting strangely. She began accosting Warren’s visitors. She shouted through the walls during the day. And at night she banged on the wall, right where Warren kept the bassinet in which her third child slept, waking him up. Warren sent a letter reporting the problem to the complex’s property manager, a company called Sawyer Realty Holdings. When there was no response, she decided to move out. In January 2010, she submitted the requisite form giving two months’ notice that she was transferring her Section 8 voucher — the federal low-income subsidy that helped her pay the rent — elsewhere. The complex’s on-site manager signed the form a week later, checking the line that read “The tenant gave notice in accordance with the lease.” So Warren was startled in January 2013, three years later, when she received a summons from a private process server informing her that she was being sued for $3,014.08 by the owner of Cove Village. The lawsuit, filed in Maryland District Court, was doubly bewildering. It claimed she owed the money for having left in advance of her lease’s expiration, though she had received written permission to leave. And the company suing her was not Sawyer, but one whose name she didn’t recognize: JK2 Westminster LLC. Warren was raising three children alone while taking classes for a bachelor’s degree in health care administration, and she disregarded the summons at first. But JK2 Westminster’s lawyers persisted; two more summonses followed. In April 2014, she appeared without a lawyer at a district court hearing. She told the judge about the approval for her move, but she did not have a copy of the form the manager had signed. The judge ruled against Warren, awarding JK2 Westminster the full sum it was seeking, plus court costs, attorney’s fees and interest that brought the judgment to nearly $5,000. There was no way Warren, who was working as a home health aide, was going to be able to pay such a sum. “I was so desperate,” she said. If the case was confounding to Warren, it was not unique. Hundreds like it have been filed over the last five years by JK2 Westminster and affiliated businesses in the state of Maryland alone, where the company owns some 8,000 apartments and townhouses. Nor was JK2 Westminster quite as anonymous as its opaque name suggested. It was a subsidiary of a large New York real-estate firm called Kushner Companies, which was led by a young man whose initials happened to be J.K.: Jared Kushner. When Americans were introduced last year to Ivanka Trump’s husband and the nation’s prospective son-in-law in chief, it was as the preternaturally poised, Harvard-educated scion of a real-estate empire whose glittering ambitions resembled Donald Trump’s own. In 2007, Kushner Companies, run at the time by Jared and his father, Charles, bought the aluminum-clad skyscraper at 666 Fifth Avenue for a record-breaking $1.8 billion; they are now seeking partners for a $12 billion plan to replace it with a glass tower that would be 40 stories taller. In 2013 they acquired 17 buildings in Manhattan’s East Village for about $130 million, and three years later they spent $715 million on a cluster of buildings owned by the Jehovah’s Witnesses on prime land in Brooklyn’s fast-developing Dumbo district. But the Kushners’ empire, like Trump’s, was underwritten by years of dealing in much more modestly ambitioned properties. Jared’s grandfather Joseph Kushner, a Holocaust survivor from Belarus, over his lifetime built a small construction company in New Jersey into a real-estate venture that owned and managed some 4,000 low-rise units concentrated in the suburbs of Newark. After taking over the business, Charles expanded Kushner Companies’ holdings to commercial and industrial spaces, but the company’s bread and butter remained the North Jersey apartment complexes bequeathed to him by his father. In the mid-2000s, the company began to sell off the more than 25,000 multifamily rental units it owned, culminating in a 2007 sale of nearly 17,000 units for $1.9 billion. The sale — near the peak of the housing boom, just months before the crash — was impeccably timed, but it also reflected a shift in the attentions of what would soon be a three-generation real-estate dynasty. Charles, a major Democratic Party donor, had returned late the previous year from a brief stint in federal prison after pleading guilty to 18 counts of tax evasion, witness tampering and illegal campaign donations. Back at the helm of the company, he began to shift its focus from New Jersey to New York City — and prepared to pass the reins to his son Jared, who had just received a degree in law and business from New York University. But amid the high-profile Manhattan and Brooklyn purchases, in 2011, Kushner Companies, with Jared now more firmly in command, pulled together a deal that looked much more like something from the firm’s humble past than from its high-rolling present. That June, the company and its equity partners bought 4,681 units of what are known in real-estate jargon as “distress-ridden, Class B” apartment complexes: units whose prices fell somewhere in the middle of the market, typically of a certain age and wear, whose owners were in financial difficulty. The properties were spread across 12 sites in Toledo, Ohio; Pittsburgh; and other Rust Belt cities still reeling from the Great Recession. Kushner had to settle more than 200 debts held against the complexes before the deal could go through; at one complex, in Pittsburgh, circumstances had become so dire that some residents had been left without heat and power because the previous owner couldn’t pay the bills. Prudential, which was foreclosing on the portfolio, sold it for only $72 million — half the value of the mortgages on the properties. In the following months, Kushner Companies bought another 1,700 multifamily units in similar markets, according to the trade publication Multifamily Executive. Unlike the company’s big New York investments, the complexes were not acquired with an eye toward appreciation — these were not growing markets, after all — but toward producing a steady cash flow. “Our goal is to keep buying and incrementally growing — they’re good markets where you can get yield,” Jared Kushner told Multifamily Executive in October 2011, predicting that the net income for the year’s purchases would be $14 million within a year. The complexes buttressed the Kushner portfolio in another way, he said: They would serve as a hedge against an upswing in inflation he believed was looming on the horizon. A year later, in August 2012, a Kushner-led investment group bought 5,500 multifamily units in the Baltimore area with $371 million in financing from Freddie Mac, the government-backed mortgage lender — another considerable bargain. Two years later, Kushner Companies picked up three more complexes in the Baltimore area for $37.9 million. Today, Westminster Management, Kushner Companies’ property-management arm, lists 34 complexes under its control in Maryland, Ohio and New Jersey, with a total of close to 20,000 units. Kushner’s largest concentration of multifamily units is in the Baltimore area, where the company controls 15 complexes in all — which, if you assume three residents per unit, could be home to more than 20,000 people. All but two of the complexes are in suburban Baltimore County, but they are only “suburban” in the most literal sense. They sit along arterial shopping strips or highways, yet they are easy to miss — the Highland Village complex, for example, is beside the Baltimore-Washington Parkway, but the tall sound barriers dividing it from the six-lane highway render its more than 1,000 units invisible to the thousands traveling that route every day. The complexes date mostly from the 1960s and ’70s, when white flight from the city was creating a huge demand for affordable housing in Baltimore County. They were meant to exude middle-class respectability — unglamorous but safe and pleasant enough, a renter’s Levittown. Since then, however, they have slipped socioeconomically, along with the middle class itself, into the vast gray area of the modern precariat — home to casino workers, distribution-warehouse pickers, Uber drivers, students at for-profit colleges. Although most of the tenants I met in a series of recent visits to the complexes pay their own rent, ranging from about $800 to $1,300, some of them receive Section 8 assistance, as Kamiia Warren did; Baltimore County has no public housing for a population of more than 825,000, so these and similar complexes have become the de facto substitute. At the time of the 2012 Baltimore purchase, Kushner raved about the promise of the low-end multifamily market. “It’s proven over the last few years to be the most resilient asset class, and at the end of the day, it’s a very stable asset class,” he told Multifamily Executive. He said things were proceeding well in the Midwestern complexes he purchased a year earlier. “It was a lot of construction and a lot of evictions,” he said. “But the communities now look great, and the outcome has been phenomenal.” Kamiia Warren still had not paid the $4,984.37 judgment against her by late 2014. Three days before Christmas that year, JK2 Westminster filed a request to garnish her wages from her in-home elder care job. Five days earlier, Warren had gone to court to fill out a handwritten motion saying she had proof that she was given permission to leave Cove Village in 2010 — she had finally managed to get a copy from the housing department. “Please give me the opportunity to plead my case,” she wrote. But she did not attach a copy of the form to her motion, not realizing it was necessary, so a judge denied it on Jan. 9, on the grounds that there was “no evidence submitted.” Kamiia Warren at Cove Village, the Kushner Companies property in Essex, Maryland, where she once lived (Philip Montgomery for The New York Times) The garnishing started that month. Warren was in the midst of leaving her job, but JK2 Westminster garnished her bank account too. After her account was zeroed out, a loss of about $900, she borrowed money from her mother to buy food for her children and pay her bills. That February — five years after she left Cove Village — Warren returned to court, this time with the housing form in hand, asking the judge to halt garnishment. “I am a single mom of three and my bank account was wiped clean by the plaintiff,” she pleaded in another handwritten request. “I cannot take care of my kids when they snatch all of my money out of my account. I do not feel I owe this money. Please have mercy on my family and I.” She told me that when she called the law office representing JK2 Westminster that same day from the courthouse to discuss the case, one of the lawyers told her: “This is not going to go away. You will pay us.” The judge denied Warren’s request without explanation. And JK2 Westminster kept pressing for the rest of the money, sending out one process server after another to present Warren with legal papers. Finally, in January 2016, the court sent notice of a $4,615 lien against Warren — a legal claim against her for the remaining judgment. Warren began to cry as she recounted the episode to me. She said the lien has greatly complicated her hopes of taking out a loan to start her own small assisted living center. She had gone a couple of years without a bank account, for fear of further garnishing. “It was just pure greed,” she said. “It was unnecessary.” I asked why she hadn’t pushed harder against the judgment once she had the necessary evidence in hand. “They know how to work this stuff,” she replied. “They know what to do, and here I am, I don’t know anything about the law. I would have to hire a lawyer or something, and I really can’t afford that. I really don’t know my rights. I don’t know all the court lingo. I knew that up against them I would lose.” A search for “JK2 Westminster” in the database of Maryland’s District Court system brings back 548 cases in which it is the plaintiff — and that does not include hundreds of other cases that have been filed in the name of the company’s individual complexes. The vast majority of these cases have been filed by a single small law firm in the Baltimore suburb of Owings Mills. The law office of Jeffrey Tapper specializes in “collections” work, with an emphasis on landlord-tenant cases. It has represented several other real-estate management companies, including Sawyer, which retains a stake in many of the Kushner complexes. In April, I drove to Owings Mills in hopes of speaking to Tapper. As I waited for him by reception, I overheard an assistant making a call about a new case, saying that the firm would continue to pursue one tenant even if the other person on the lease had filed for bankruptcy. Tapper emerged, a man in his mid-60s with white hair, a paunch and a large smartphone clipped to his belt. Our interview was brief. “I’m not having any conversation with you that has to do with one of my clients,” he said. “I’m not helping you with any of whatever you’re trying to do.” In the cases that Tapper has brought to court on behalf of JK2 Westminster and individual Kushner-controlled companies, there is a clear pattern of Kushner Companies’ pursuing tenants over virtually any unpaid rent or broken lease — even in the numerous cases where the facts appear to be on the tenants’ side. Not only does the company file cases against them, it pursues the cases for as long as it takes to collect from the overmatched defendants — often several years. The court docket of JK2 Westminster’s case against Warren, for instance, spans more than three years and 112 actions — for a sum that amounts to maybe two days’ worth of billings for the average corporate law firm associate, from a woman who never even rented from JK2 Westminster. The pursuit is all the more remarkable given how transient the company’s prey tends to be. Hounding former tenants for money means paying to send out process servers who often report back that they were unable to locate the target. This does not deter Kushner Companies’ lawyers. They send the servers back out again a few months later. In March 2009, Joan Beverly, a probation agent, signed the lease for her daughter, Lennettea, for a unit at Dutch Village, a complex on the northern edge of Baltimore. Lennettea moved out a year later, several months before her lease was up. Kushner Companies bought Dutch Village more than two years later. In December 2012, JK2 Westminster filed suit in Baltimore County District Court against Beverly, seeking $3,810.16 — several months of rent it said it was owed, plus about $1,000 in repair costs, including $10 for “failure to return laundry room card.” That February, Lennettea filed a written court notice explaining that her mother, who was dying of pancreatic cancer, was “in terminal hospice care and is not eligible to work.” She added by way of supporting evidence a letter from the hospice provider to Joan Beverly’s bank, explaining her and her husband’s late mortgage payments on their home: “There has been added financial stress because Mrs. Beverly is very ill at this time.” But JK2 Westminster persisted in seeking a hearing on the suit. In March, a district court judge found in favor of the company — a total judgment against Joan of more than $5,500. Joan died two weeks later. Her husband, Tyrone Beverly, a retired longshoreman, requested that the judgment against his deceased wife be removed but was denied. The case remains open in the court database. Tyrone, who was married to Joan for 32 years, told me that he had assumed the judgment had been dismissed and was unaware that it was still listed as awaiting payment. “They just didn’t treat us fair,” he said. Dutch Village, a Kushner Companies-owned complex in Baltimore (Philip Montgomery for The New York Times) The sweeping nature of the company’s pursuit of tenants was most evident when those tenants were, in fact, prepared to defend themselves. Shawanda Hough moved out of her unit in the Carriage Hill complex in the northwestern Baltimore suburb of Randallstown in early 2012 after black mold worsened her son’s asthma, landing him in the hospital twice. After the maintenance crew tried and failed to fix the problem, she got the rental office’s written permission to move out in advance of her lease. But then Kushner Companies bought Carriage Hill, and a year and a half later, in August 2013, JK2 Westminster filed a lawsuit against Hough, seeking $4,068.53. Hough fought back. In a court filing, she said that she had kept all of her documentation, and that the company had assured her that it had not lost a dime in rent; she had gone so far as to coordinate the time of her departure with the arrival of a new tenant. JK2 Westminster went ahead with a hearing before a judge a month later, but the judge ultimately found for Hough. Cases like Hough’s, however, were the exception rather than the rule. Overall, about nine out of every 10 cases brought by JK2 Westminster that I surveyed resulted in judgments against the defendants, who often did not appear in person for the hearings — and if they did, almost never had legal representation. How could it possibly be worth Kushner Companies’ while to pursue hundreds of people so aggressively over a few thousand dollars here and there? After all, the pursuit itself cost money. And it wasn’t happening just in Baltimore — Doug Wilkins, a lawyer in Toledo who has represented some of the complexes bought there by Kushner, told me the company is seeking far more monetary judgments than did previous owners. When I presented JK2 Westminster’s record of litigation to Matthew Cypher, a Georgetown University business professor who used to work for the real-estate giant Invesco, he said it was highly unusual to put so much effort into pursuing former tenants in court. “These people fade into the shadows of the night,” he said. “It’s amazing to me that there’s that much to go after.” Brian Pendergraft, an attorney in Greenbelt, Maryland, who works on both sides of landlord-tenant litigation, told me he had heard of large property-management companies pursuing former tenants for unpaid rent but not going so far as to pursue tenants who predated the company’s ownership of a complex. “I guess you can do it,” he said, “but I don’t think it’s cool.” But Matthew Hertz, whose Bethesda, Maryland, firm represents landlords and tenants in similar cases, explained to me that there is a logic behind such aggressive tactics. The costs of the pursuit are not as high as you might imagine, he said — people are not that hard to find in the age of cellphones and easily accessible databases. “If I give my process server a name and phone number, it’s generally enough to trace you,” he said. “If I have a date of birth and Social Security number, it’s even easier.” The legal costs can be billed to the defendant as attorney’s fees, if the terms of the lease allow. And garnishing wages is relatively easy to do by court order, assuming the defendant has wages to garnish. As for pursuing former tenants from years before the new company’s ownership of a complex, Hertz said it was hardly different from an investor’s buying a portfolio of mortgages: It’s debt to be collected on. “If you buy someone’s properties, you’re buying their debts, not just their assets. You take the good with the bad, and try to collect on the bad. Even if you only get back 5 percent, you’re making something,” he said. “It’s, ‘I’m buying up this property and if I can collect anything, it’s gravy on top.’” There was, Hertz added, an ancillary benefit to such relentless pursuit: sending a message to current tenants. One way to make sure that tenants are paying their rent and to keep them from breaking leases early — which brings with it the costs and hassles of having to clean apartments and find new tenants — is to instill a sense of fear about violating a lease. “Any landlord takes that into account,” Hertz said. “They know tenants are going to talk to each other. If they say, ‘He’s going to come after you,’ it’s deterrence.” When Kushner Companies finally responded to my questions about the cases, they essentially affirmed Hertz’s reasoning. As manager for the Baltimore complexes, the company had a “fiduciary obligation” to its ownership partners to collect as much revenue as it could, said Kushner Companies’ chief financial officer, Jennifer McLean, in a written response. She said the company’s legal costs have been “minimal” compared with what it seeks to recover. McLean declined to comment on several cases, including Kamiia Warren’s. But she said the pursuit of Joan Beverly, the woman dying of cancer, was justified. “This tenant owed the landlord $3,819.16,” she said in the written statement. “As property manager, it’s our job to collect rent payments.” In general, “Westminster Management only takes legal action against a tenant when absolutely necessary,” McLean said. “If legal action is pursued, however, the company follows guidelines consistent with industry standards.” She added: “While taking a tenant to court is far from an ideal outcome, that option — and clear rules governing it — must exist as a last resort.” The Highland Village complex, along the Baltimore-Washington Parkway, is one of Kushner Companies’ largest, a vast maze of lanes and courts lined with rows of short brick-and-siding-fronted homes. Like the other Kushner complexes I visited in Baltimore’s southern and eastern suburbs, it is situated in what was once a predominantly white working-class community, within reasonable commuting distance of the harbor and industrial plants, now defunct, like Bethlehem Steel. In recent decades, many black transplants from the city and Hispanic immigrants have arrived as well, and Highland Village is an unusually integrated place. Highland Village, where many residents complained about the owners’ aggressive rent-collection practices (Philip Montgomery for The New York Times) The complex, like the others I saw, seemed designed to preclude neighborliness — most of the townhouses lack even the barest stoop to sit out on, and at least one complex has signs forbidding ball-playing (“violators will be prosecuted”). At another complex, kids had drawn a rectangle on the side of a storage shed in lieu of a hoop for their basketball game. The only meeting points at many of the complexes are the metal mailbox stands, the dumpsters and the laundry room. And the only thing that united many of the residents I spoke to, it seemed, was resentment of their landlord. They complained about Westminster Management’s aggressive rent-collection practices, which many told me exceeded what they had experienced under the previous owners. Rent is marked officially late, they said, if it arrives after 4:30 p.m. on the fifth day of the month. But Westminster recently made paying the rent much more of a challenge. Last fall, it sent notice to residents saying that they could no longer pay by money order (on which many residents, who lack checking accounts, had relied) at the complex’s rental office and would instead need to go to a Walmart or Ace Cash Express and use an assigned “WIPS card” — a plastic card linked to the resident’s account — to pay their rent there. That method carries a $3.50 fee for every payment, and getting to the Walmart or Ace is difficult for the many residents without cars. Tenants who pay after the fifth are hit with late fees that start around $40 to $50 and escalate from there, with court fees usually added on as well. What upsets residents most, though, are not the fees themselves but that the property managers, instead of putting pink or yellow late notices and court summonses discreetly in mailboxes or under doors, post them in public — on the front doors of townhouse units or on lobby walls or lobby doors of apartment buildings. This bothered even tenants who said they always paid their rent on time. “The whole neighborhood knows,” said Marquita Parmely, a truck driver who pays $1,010 a month to rent a townhouse at Essex Park, near Cove Village. Dareck Cromwell, a retiree living at Carriage Hill, told me: “They put them in the windows for everybody to see, to see your business. That’s not right. You don’t put people’s business out like that.” Compounding these grievances was Westminster’s maintenance of the properties — or lack thereof. Their complexes comprise hundreds of units, but typically have only four or so workers looking after them. Alishia Jamesson, a 30-year-old Highland Village resident, invited me into the small living room of the $842-a-month townhouse she and her fiancé share with her two children. The room was cluttered with bags from Walmart and Dollar Tree, ketchup packets and supplies for the work Jamesson took up after she lost her cashier’s job at Walmart for missing too many shifts for parenting duties: making personalized tote bags and gift baskets for weddings. Jamesson showed me three large holes in the walls of the townhouse, which Westminster charged her and her fiancé, Keith Riggs, $150 to fix in October but had not yet repaired. “Every time I ask about drywall they say, ‘Oh, well, we only have one drywall person,’” Riggs told me. There was also black mold spreading around the bathtub, a large brown stain and crack on the wall adjacent to the stove and a gap in the bathroom skylight that allowed in rain and snow. Jamesson told me that the refrigerator hadn’t worked for more than a month before being replaced; her family had lived on canned food and boxed milk. Complaints about poor upkeep abounded at the other complexes too. At Highland Village, there was the matter of the vacant unit that burned down one night a couple of months ago: Its shell was still standing, attended by nothing but plywood and a tarp. At Essex Park, east of the city, Marquita Parmely, the truck driver, told me she had a mouse infestation that was severe enough that her 12-year-old daughter recently found one in her bed. Parmely also has a 2-year-old with asthma, which is aggravated by allergens in mice droppings. She moved her own bed and other furniture away from the walls to dissuade mice, kept the family’s laundry in tote bags after mice started appearing in the hamper and vacuumed twice a day. Her neighbor told me it took weeks for staff members to replace a rear window that had been shot out by kids with a BB gun. A late-rent notice left on the front door of a Kushner Companies complex in a suburb of Baltimore (Philip Montgomery for The New York Times) At the Carroll Park complex in Middle River, Maryland, Jen Jackson showed me a ceiling leak that was causing a mold problem. At the Whispering Woods townhouses nearby, a resident named Nicole, who asked that I not use her last name, told me she had filed unheeded complaints about loose plastic shutters, one of which finally fell off and hit her in the head. (When I visited Nicole again a few weeks later, she told me that Westminster staff had scolded her for speaking with me and told her not to do so again. A large black pickup followed me and a photographer as we walked through the complex until we left.) In the same complex, Renee Cook showed me the large swath of her downstairs ceiling that had collapsed and the mold and mildew beneath the carpet, each resulting from a leak from her neighbor’s (illicit) washer-dryer. Asked about such conditions, Kushner Companies said it follows industry standards for maintenance staffing and exterminator visits, and that it and its partners had spent $10 million on upgrades across the complexes. “Despite those improvements, issues still arise, given the age of the properties,” said McLean, the chief financial officer. Shortly after I put questions to the company about specific tenants’ complaints, Cook’s ceiling was repaired. The worst troubles may have been those described in a 2013 court case involving Jasmine Cox’s unit at Cove Village. They began with the bedroom ceiling, which started leaking one day. Then maggots started coming out of the living room carpet. Then raw sewage started flowing out of the kitchen sink. “It sounded like someone turned a pool upside down,” Cox told me. “I heard the water hitting the floor and I panicked. I got out of bed and the sink is black and gray, it’s pooling out of the sink and the house smells terrible.” Cox stopped cooking for herself and her son, not wanting food near the sink. A judge allowed her reduced rent for one month. When she moved out soon afterward, Westminster Management sent her a $600 invoice for a new carpet and other repairs. Cox, who is now working as a battery-test engineer and about to buy her first home, was unaware who was behind the company that had put her through such an ordeal. When I told her of Kushner’s involvement, there was a silence as she took it in. “Get that [expletive] out of here,” she said. Very few of the complex residents I met, even ones who had been pursued at length in court by JK2 Westminster, had any idea that their rent and late fees were going to the family company of the president’s son-in-law. “That Jared Kushner?” Danny Jackson, a plumber in his 15th year living at Harbor Point Estates, exclaimed. “Oh, my God. And I thought he was the good one.” Mike McHargue, whose girlfriend Patricia Howell is a Trump supporter, did not know that Jared Kushner owns the housing complex in Middle River, Maryland, where he lives. (Philip Montgomery for The New York Times) Jackson said he voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016. Many of the others I spoke with had not voted — in that or any other election. “I’m not a big political person, so I feel like I don’t think I should vote on something I know nothing about,” Alishia Jamesson told me. But eastern Baltimore County was a Trump stronghold, a formerly staunch Democratic territory with many downwardly mobile white voters — and Kushner’s complexes were no exception. East of the city, I met Chris Freimiller, a 38-year-old resident of the company’s Morningside Park complex, who was smoking Newports in his car before heading to work at a Rite Aid distribution center. Freimiller complained to me about the persistent leaks from the toilet and the ceiling damage it had caused, and about being hit repeatedly with late fees. He told me he voted for president for the first time ever last year — for Donald Trump. His vote, he said, was motivated by “the racial and police issues. How bad it got with Obama and how he seemed to promote the cop-bashing and the racial divide.” Did knowing that he was sending his late fees to Trump’s son-in-law change anything? “Yeah, actually,” he said. “As if they need any more money.” At the Carroll Park complex, I met Mike McHargue, a private investigator, and his girlfriend, Patricia Howell. “They’re nothing but slumlords,” Howell told me of Westminster Management. “They take everyone’s money.” When I asked if they knew who was behind the company, they said they did not. “Oh, really?” Howell said when I mentioned Kushner’s name. “Oh, really. And I’m a Trump supporter.” Jared Kushner stepped down as chief executive of Kushner Companies in January. But he remains a stakeholder in the company — his share of company-related trusts is estimated to be worth at least $600 million — and the company says it has no intention of selling off its multifamily holdings. (JK2 Westminster was formally dissolved in December, but Kushner Companies still owns the complexes through other entities; lawsuits against tenants are now typically filed in the names of the complexes themselves.) Because Kushner retains his interest in the complexes, the White House told The Baltimore Sun in February that he would recuse himself from any policy decisions about Section 8 funding, as many of his tenants rely on it for their rent. But even as Kushner now busies himself with his ever-expanding White House portfolio, his company is carrying on its vigorous efforts in court. On April 17, three cases were being held consecutively in Baltimore’s District Court involving tenants of the Dutch Village complex. One was against Catherine Silver, a Morgan State University student who had given notice that she was moving at the end of March — she was fed up with lousy maintenance (among other things, a perpetually clogged toilet and a ceiling leak in her closet). But when Silver went to Walmart to pay her March rent with her WIPS card, the money mistakenly ended up not in the account for Dutch Village but the one for Kushner Companies’ adjacent complex, Pleasantview. Westminster Management started eviction proceedings. On March 23, a sheriff’s deputy changed the locks on the unit. Silver was traveling at the time — it was spring break — and it was not until March 31 that she was able to explain to a judge what happened and get her keys back. By that point, it was too late to get her possessions into the moving truck she’d rented, and classes had resumed. She stayed in the unit, in which Westminster had turned off the heat and hot water, trying again to plan her departure. But Westminster was now after her for April’s rent, despite the fact that the company had literally barred her from being able to move before April, as she had intended. On April 25, a judge ruled that she needed to pay half of April’s rent, plus court costs: $471. White House Power Player Jared Kushner Is Keeping Parts of His Real-Estate Empire Given Kushner’s vast portfolio as an adviser to the president, it’s not clear how he’s going to avoid issues that could affect his bank account. The Trump administration has declined to give details. Read the story. Westminster had a lawyer from Tapper’s firm, Andrew Rabinowitz, at the April 25 hearing, which lasted more than three hours — all over less than $500. The next day Rabinowitz was back to defend Westminster against Silver’s criminal complaint over the unfounded eviction. This time, he was more accommodating, perhaps because he realized a reporter was present. After conferring with Dutch Village’s property manager, who was also in attendance, Rabinowitz agreed to let Silver have until the end of May to move out, rent-free, as long as she paid for April. Silver asked if she could have her hot water turned back on. He said he would look into it. But when I visited Silver two weeks later, the hot water was still off. The stove was covered with the pots she was using to boil water for bathing. On May 10 at the Highland Village complex, a woman was distributing the yellow “failure to pay rent” notices filed with the District Court to tenants who were behind on their May rent. One went up on the door of a man who introduced himself to me as Tommy, a recently divorced house painter with two children, who was at that moment sitting in his pickup truck reading Psalm 91 to gird himself for a visit to traffic court. He said he didn’t know why he kept being hit with late fees and court fees at Highland Village because he was up to date on the rent itself. Over at Carroll Park, Mike McHargue, the private investigator, had also received a yellow notice and was trying to find out when he needed to come up with money to avoid eviction. So was Chris Freimiller, the Rite Aid worker. He had missed a couple weeks of work with back pain related to a metal bar in his leg from an earlier car accident, and Westminster Management had moved quickly to file for eviction over $722.09 in missing rent, plus $66 in fees. When I arrived, Freimiller was sleeping on the couch after a night shift, and his wife, Jaclyn Meador, was trying to get an eviction date from the constable while their 11-year-old son, Ethan, looked on. One more yellow notice was affixed at the Highland Park home of Alishia Jamesson, the wedding-basket maker. Her fiancé had left his job as a casino housekeeper to take a job handling Amazon packages near the airport, but his first check hadn’t come through yet. Jamesson was working at Walmart again. The couple’s car tags had expired, so both were enduring long public transit commutes. No one had come from maintenance. There were still three holes in the wall.

Bloomberg | May 24, 2017 (Bloomberg) — House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady said he’s open to reviewing parts of the House Republican tax blueprint as Congress looks for a path forward on trying to make U.S. businesses more competitive globally -- even as Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin offered his most direct criticism of the plan yet. “We know there are legitimate concerns -- including from some of our witnesses here today and our colleagues on the other side of the aisle -- about how it will affect American workers, businesses, and consumers,” Brady said Tuesday during a more than three-hour hearing to discuss a controversial proposal for a border-adjusted tax on imports. Afterward, Brady told reporters that a key point is to “address this transition and design in a way that eliminates those uncertainties and creates that good solid deliberate approach going forward.” Still, little consensus emerged from the hearing, which featured testimony from Target Corp. Chief Executive Officer Brian Cornell, who’s been fighting along with other retailers and import-heavy industries to kill the proposal. One of the witnesses opposing Cornell was Bill Simon, a former top executive for Wal-Mart Stores Inc., who recently called the retail industry “hysterical” on the issue. As witnesses debated such fine points as the BAT proposal’s effects on consumer prices and the strength of the dollar, Mnuchin sounded a clear warning about the measure during a separate appearance in Washington.  “One of the problems with the border-adjusted tax is that it doesn’t create a level playing field,” said Mnuchin, who is playing a key role in shaping legislation with the House and Senate. “It has very different impacts on different companies, it has the potential to pass on significant costs to the consumer, it has the potential of moving the currencies.” ‘If’ Refrain  The House Republican leaders’ tax plan depends in part on taxing U.S. companies’ domestic sales and imported goods while exempting exports. The concept has faced resistance from President Donald Trump’s top economic advisers as well as criticism among Senate Republicans.  Mnuchin said during a meeting Tuesday with members of the House Freedom Caucus that he and Trump are inclined to oppose the border-adjusted tax, according to two people familiar with the conversation who asked not to be identified because the meeting was private. During the hearing, Cornell said the most repeated word was “if” -- in reference to uncertainty about how currency markets would react, the effect the plan would have on consumer prices and the impact more expensive imports would have on business models for different industries. During his opening statement, Cornell said Target’s tax rate would jump to 75 percent from 35 percent, potentially jeopardizing a planned $7 billion investment plan. “It’s really hard for me to sit here today and craft a business plan,” Cornell said, “when I sit here today and keep hearing if.” The measure’s supporters say it would lead to a strengthening dollar, which would even out its effect on the price of imported goods. Simon made clear that a border-adjusted tax would need to be implemented carefully to avoid damaging retailers and raising consumer prices. “If we take the time and do the work and sit down in a group and iron out, lay out what it will look like, I think it will be very successful” for U.S. manufacturing without harming other sectors, Simon said. Still, Simon warned if the transition rules weren’t done correctly, there could be a slowdown in some imports. Republican Opposition Republican lawmakers including Jim Renacci of Ohio and Mike Kelly of Pennsylvania criticized the border-adjusted tax’s potential impact on working Americans. Representative Lloyd Doggett, a Texas Democrat, said the BAT is already on “life support.”  “There were considerable concerns raised by several Republicans on the committee and all Democrats,” said Brian Dodge, senior executive vice president for public affairs at the Retail Industry Leaders Association, which opposes the BAT. “Anyone who watched this hearing looking to understand if and how this would work in the real world could only be left deeply deeply concerned.” House Speaker Paul Ryan said May 18 that a border-adjusted tax “should have some kind of an adjustment and phase-in period.” Importers have brought some suggestions to the Ways and Means committee, such as tax credits for assembly in the U.S. and different ways to phase in the tax on goods brought into the country, Brady told reporters after the hearing. Retail Meeting The retail lobby, however, has said it opposes BAT in any form. A group of CEOs from companies that are members of the National Retail Federation is scheduled to meet with Mnuchin and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross on Wednesday as part of its lobbying effort against BAT this week, according to BJ’s Wholesale Club Inc. CEO Chris Baldwin who is part of the contingent. Analysis done by BJ’s shows border adjustment would quadruple its federal tax bill to more than 80 percent, Baldwin said.  “Ultimately because this will result in significant price increases on important goods and services to consumers, I don’t see how slowing it makes it any better,” Baldwin said. “Consumers will bare the brunt of this change, whether they do it today or over a period of time.”  The border adjustment portion of the House leaders’ tax plan is estimated to raise more than $1 trillion in new revenue over the next decade -- helping to pay for cuts to the corporate and individual income-tax rates that the GOP also wants. Writing a revenue-neutral tax bill is important to Republicans, who plan to move the legislation through the Senate without any Democratic votes. To achieve that aim, Senate rules require that the bill can’t increase the federal deficit in the long run.   --With assistance from Saleha Mohsin and Billy House.To contact the reporters on this story: Anna Edgerton in Washington at [email protected] ;Matt Townsend in New York at [email protected] To contact the editors responsible for this story: John Voskuhl at [email protected] Alexis Leondis  © 2017 Bloomberg L.P 0 comments Hide comments Comment * More information about text formats Text format CommentsPlain text Comments Allowed HTML tags: <em> <strong> <blockquote> <br> <p> Plain text No HTML tags allowed.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 24 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Building on Success in Dallas, the 100,000 Opportunities Initiative™ Looks Ahead to the Washington, D.C. Metro area with Goal to Hire 1 Million Opportunity Youth across the U.S. by 2020 DALLAS & WASHINGTON–(BUSINESS WIRE)–The 100,000 Opportunities Initiative™, the nation’s largest employer-led coalition committed to creating pathways to employment for young people, today announced that participating companies offered 700 jobs to Opportunity Youth – 16-24-year-olds who are not in school nor employed – in a single day at the Dallas Opportunity Fair on May 19. The event marked a key milestone in a national effort that first launched in 2015 and has since already connected more than 100,000 young people to jobs two years ahead of schedule. Since 2015, through partnerships with public and private sector stakeholders in Chicago, Los Angeles, Phoenix, Seattle and most recently Dallas, the coalition has expanded its work, including a new goal to hire 1 million opportunity youth by 2020. Today, the 100,000 Opportunities Initiative also announced plans to expand to the nation’s capital with its next Opportunity Fair scheduled for this fall in Washington, D.C. Working with local community and civic leaders, the event is expected to connect thousands of DC-area youth to employment pathways with companies like Starbucks, FedEx, Five Guys, HMS Host, Macy’s, Nordstrom, Ulta Beauty, and more. Bridging the Opportunity Divide in Dallas, and Beyond In Dallas, an estimated 109,000 young people ages 16-24 are not in school or employed – making up roughly 13% of youth in the area. The Dallas Opportunity Fair, on May 19, brought together more than 600 hiring managers and volunteers from more than 30 companies. The 100,000 Opportunities Initiative™ members that participated in the event included Starbucks, FedEx, JCPenney, Macy’s, Pizza Hut, Ulta Beauty, Walmart, and more, as well as local companies. These companies connected with nearly 2,000 Opportunity Youth from the Dallas/Ft. Worth metro area with the goal to connect them to jobs, apprenticeships, internships and educational opportunities. In the end, companies offered approximately 700 jobs, creating immediate impact for the young men and women in attendance. More than 60% of interviews, resulted in an offer on the spot. The Opportunity Fairs are just one part of the overall approach. The 100,000 Opportunities Initiative is committed to creating lasting change in Dallas to make it easier for young adults to find and retain good jobs in which they can thrive. With funding from the Schultz Family Foundation and Starbucks, Workforce Solutions Greater Dallas will be responsible for building on the Opportunity Fair’s success as it leads the ongoing work of 100,000 Opportunities Initiative™ in the Dallas region. Workforce Solutions Greater Dallas will help to ensure that young people are prepared to enter the workforce and that Dallas-area employers continue to strengthen their commitment to hiring Opportunity Youth; they will also host an ongoing series of smaller events to support thousands of young adults looking for work. The coalition, together with the City of Dallas, Workforce Solutions Greater Dallas, CitySquare, United Way of Metropolitan Dallas and 30 other organizations, took some practical first steps at the Opportunity Fair to help young people prepare for work. Some examples of resources offered to young people included: More than 500 young adults connected with workforce development & training programs 450+ volunteers and staff from coalition companies and community groups to help support young people during the day and to staff company booths and experiences 200+ received access to healthcare services 200+ youth built their confidence in artfully orchestrated practice interviews 100 youth explored high school re-engagement options and over 100 literacy books were given to attendees Nearly 50 youth took a food handling class, passed the food handler permit test, and got their permit – for free thanks to the generous support of the Schultz Family Foundation. Nearly 50 youth learned more about banking and financial resources Hundreds of youth worked on their resumes and completed job applications under the support of countless resume coaches and application expert volunteers Building a Coalition of Support for Opportunity Youth Hiring in Washington, D.C. The 100,000 Opportunities Initiative™ is working with community-based organizations and civic leaders across America to ensure this initiative expands to other cities and continues to host on-going hiring fairs long after the initial event. Following the close of the Opportunity Fair in Dallas last week, the Coalition plans to expand its work to the Washington, D.C. metro area this fall. In Washington, D.C., the coalition will work closely with the Office of Mayor Muriel Bowser and other civic leaders across the region as it begins identifying a network of community based organizations working to connect opportunity youth to jobs and pathways to success. In the D.C. area, where an estimated 70,000, 10 percent, youth are disconnected from work and school, the coalition will aim to apply best practices from its work in other cities where it has already hired more than 100,000 young people. The D.C. Metro area will focus on recruiting and hiring youth from the most underserved communities in the Metro area. About the 100,000 Opportunities Initiative™ The 100,000 Opportunities Initiative™ has the goal of creating the nation’s largest employer-led private sector coalition committed to creating pathways to employment for young people. Companies engaged in the coalition will help to launch careers for young people that are just entering the workforce, including internships, apprenticeships and on the job training, in addition to developing potential in youth that have some work experience but are looking to gain new skills that lead to a successful career.

Opportunity Youth - 16-24-year-olds who are not in school or employed - at the Dallas Opportunity Fair on May 19, hosted by the 100,000 Opportunities Initiative™. (Photo: Business Wire) Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail Small Preview Thumbnail May 24, 2017 12:07 PM Eastern Daylight Time DALLAS & WASHINGTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The 100,000 Opportunities Initiative™, the nation’s largest employer-led coalition committed to creating pathways to employment for young people, today announced that participating companies offered 700 jobs to Opportunity Youth – 16-24-year-olds who are not in school nor employed – in a single day at the Dallas Opportunity Fair on May 19. The event marked a key milestone in a national effort that first launched in 2015 and has since already connected more than 100,000 young people to jobs two years ahead of schedule. Since 2015, through partnerships with public and private sector stakeholders in Chicago, Los Angeles, Phoenix, Seattle and most recently Dallas, the coalition has expanded its work, including a new goal to hire 1 million opportunity youth by 2020. Today, the 100,000 Opportunities Initiative also announced plans to expand to the nation’s capital with its next Opportunity Fair scheduled for this fall in Washington, D.C. Working with local community and civic leaders, the event is expected to connect thousands of DC-area youth to employment pathways with companies like Starbucks, FedEx, Five Guys, HMS Host, Macy’s, Nordstrom, Ulta Beauty, and more. Bridging the Opportunity Divide in Dallas, and Beyond In Dallas, an estimated 109,000 young people ages 16-24 are not in school or employed – making up roughly 13% of youth in the area. The Dallas Opportunity Fair, on May 19, brought together more than 600 hiring managers and volunteers from more than 30 companies. The 100,000 Opportunities Initiative™ members that participated in the event included Starbucks, FedEx, JCPenney, Macy’s, Pizza Hut, Ulta Beauty, Walmart, and more, as well as local companies. These companies connected with nearly 2,000 Opportunity Youth from the Dallas/Ft. Worth metro area with the goal to connect them to jobs, apprenticeships, internships and educational opportunities. In the end, companies offered approximately 700 jobs, creating immediate impact for the young men and women in attendance. More than 60% of interviews, resulted in an offer on the spot. The Opportunity Fairs are just one part of the overall approach. The 100,000 Opportunities Initiative is committed to creating lasting change in Dallas to make it easier for young adults to find and retain good jobs in which they can thrive. With funding from the Schultz Family Foundation and Starbucks, Workforce Solutions Greater Dallas will be responsible for building on the Opportunity Fair’s success as it leads the ongoing work of 100,000 Opportunities Initiative™ in the Dallas region. Workforce Solutions Greater Dallas will help to ensure that young people are prepared to enter the workforce and that Dallas-area employers continue to strengthen their commitment to hiring Opportunity Youth; they will also host an ongoing series of smaller events to support thousands of young adults looking for work. The coalition, together with the City of Dallas, Workforce Solutions Greater Dallas, CitySquare, United Way of Metropolitan Dallas and 30 other organizations, took some practical first steps at the Opportunity Fair to help young people prepare for work. Some examples of resources offered to young people included: More than 500 young adults connected with workforce development & training programs 450+ volunteers and staff from coalition companies and community groups to help support young people during the day and to staff company booths and experiences 200+ received access to healthcare services 200+ youth built their confidence in artfully orchestrated practice interviews 100 youth explored high school re-engagement options and over 100 literacy books were given to attendees Nearly 50 youth took a food handling class, passed the food handler permit test, and got their permit – for free thanks to the generous support of the Schultz Family Foundation. Nearly 50 youth learned more about banking and financial resources Hundreds of youth worked on their resumes and completed job applications under the support of countless resume coaches and application expert volunteers Building a Coalition of Support for Opportunity Youth Hiring in Washington, D.C. The 100,000 Opportunities Initiative™ is working with community-based organizations and civic leaders across America to ensure this initiative expands to other cities and continues to host on-going hiring fairs long after the initial event. Following the close of the Opportunity Fair in Dallas last week, the Coalition plans to expand its work to the Washington, D.C. metro area this fall. In Washington, D.C., the coalition will work closely with the Office of Mayor Muriel Bowser and other civic leaders across the region as it begins identifying a network of community based organizations working to connect opportunity youth to jobs and pathways to success. In the D.C. area, where an estimated 70,000, 10 percent, youth are disconnected from work and school, the coalition will aim to apply best practices from its work in other cities where it has already hired more than 100,000 young people. The D.C. Metro area will focus on recruiting and hiring youth from the most underserved communities in the Metro area. About the 100,000 Opportunities Initiative™ The 100,000 Opportunities Initiative™ has the goal of creating the nation’s largest employer-led private sector coalition committed to creating pathways to employment for young people. Companies engaged in the coalition will help to launch careers for young people that are just entering the workforce, including internships, apprenticeships and on the job training, in addition to developing potential in youth that have some work experience but are looking to gain new skills that lead to a successful career.

The 3rd Annual Statewide Tracking Report, prepared by the Arkansas Center for Health Improvement and released May 23, studied Arkansas’s Healthcare Payment Improvement Initiative (AHCPII). Medical providers traditionally have been reimbursed on a fee-for-service model based on the amount of care provided. AHCPII began in 2011 as an initiative to control costs by financially rewarding quality and efficiency. It originally involved the state Department of Human Services, then-Surgeon General Dr. Joe Thompson, Arkansas Blue Cross and Blue Shield and Qualchoice. Later participants included insurance provider Centene/Ambetter and self-insured employers including Walmart and the plan covering state and public school employees. The initiative includes two strategies. One is a patient-centered medical home program, where a provider coordinates prevention, chronic disease management, and other aspects of care. The other is the episodes of care model, where, for 14 types of acute conditions, a “patient journey” was created describing events that should and should not happen. Quality metrics and expected costs were established, with a principal accountable provider assigned to each episode. Those providers are eligible for bonus payments if targets are met and can be required to provide refunds if they are not. The report found that the patient-centered medical home program, which began in 2014, reduced the rate of growth in health care costs for the second consecutive year, with costs rising .7% among patient-centered medical home practices compared to 1% growth among other practices and a benchmark trend of 2.6% based on historical cost growth in Arkansas. The program’s cost of $606.5 million was $54.4 million less than the expected $661 million cost, a reduction of 8.2%. In 2014, that reduction was $34.3 million. Of that $54.5 million, $14.8 million was reinvested in the provider community for activities such as using electronic health records and providing full-time live telephone access to patients. Another $4.6 million was shared with 22 provider groups who achieved quality and financial targets. Payments ranged from $35,000 to more than $1.5 million. The remaining $35 million represented the final cost savings. The report found that the patient-centered medical home program reduced Arkansas Medicaid hospitalizations by 16.6% and reduced emergency room visits by 5.6% in 2015 after those numbers also fell the previous year. Measurements for diabetes management, breast cancer screenings, and thyroid screenings among Medicaid patients improved. But other quality measurements among those patients decreased from 2014 to 2015. Adolescent wellness visits were reduced by almost 11%, infant and child wellness visits dropped by almost 4%, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) assessments fell almost 3%. The report found that the majority of eligible medical providers are now participating in the initiative. Participation in the patient-centered medical home program has grown to 192 clinics and 919 primary care providers in 2017, up from 123 clinics and 659 primary care providers in 2014. The percentage of eligible Medicaid recipients served by a patient-centered medical home increased from 77% in 2014 to 82.5% in 2015, or 339,000 recipients. The episodes of care model also saw improvements and achieved cost savings in several areas. Among Medicaid patients, the percentage of C-sections has been reduced each year since 2012, falling from 39% in 2012 to 32% in 2015. Among Blue Cross patients, the rate of C-sections fell from 38.7% in 2014 to 35.9% in 2015. Costs for the entire childbirth process were reduced from $3,508 in 2012 to $3,413 in 2015 among Medicaid patients. Among Blue Cross patients, however, they rose 1.3% in 2015 after falling 1.6% the year before. Other results among Medicaid patients treated with the episodes of care model included the following: – Unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions for non-specific upper respiratory infections dropped 28% from 2012 to 2015, while costs per episode were flat despite increases in drug prices. – ADHD episode costs fell 19% from 2013 to 2015. – The costs of total joint replacements fell by 4% per episode from 2014 to 2015. – The average cost for a colonoscopy episode fell 9% from 2013 to 2015. Medicaid and Blue Cross are considering adding other episodes, including appendectomies, pediatric pneumonia, hysterectomies, and urinary tract infections involving emergency room visits. To make AHCPII possible, an advanced analytic infrastructure was developed that has processed 2 billion medical claims for more than 5.3 million episodes in Medicaid alone. The program was implemented with the help of a $42 million federal State Innovation Model Testing grant by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Arkansas was one of six states to receive the grant in 2013. The effort mirrors one by the federal Medicare program, which is also pushing alternative payment models meant to incentivize quality and efficiency. Arkansas was one of seven regions participating in the program’s Comprehensive Primary Care initiative launched in 2012 and was one of four that generated shared savings of $11.5 million after costs in 2015. Hospital admissions fell by 15.7%. The state is one of 14 states participating in the second-phase Comprehensive Primary Care Plus initiative. Participation will expand from 69 Arkansas clinics involved in the first initiative to 182 primary care practices this year. The Arkansas Center for Health Improvement, which performed the study, is a health policy center supported by the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, the Arkansas Department of Health, Arkansas Blue Cross and Blue Shield, and Arkansas Children’s Hospital.

Circle with Disney raises $10 million for its parental control device for families Posted 15 hours ago by Sarah Perez (@sarahintampa) 0 SHARES Next Story How to stage an ICO (and answers to other lingering questions you might have) Circle Media, the company behind Circle with Disney – a device that helps parents enforce their home’s internet rules and restrictions – has raised $10 million in Series A funding, the company announced this morning. The round was led by early stage venture fund Relay Ventures. There was another private equity investment in the round, but the parties didn’t want to be named. The Portland-based startup had previously raised $800,000 in startup capital and $3 million in convertible notes. We had reported $1.5 million raised in November 2015, while fundraising was ongoing. The A round included $7 million in new money from Relay and others, as well as the $3 million in convertible notes that changed from loan to stock. Counting this as additional new money, Circle has raised $10 million to date. The idea behind Circle with Disney is to offer parents a simpler way of managing the devices on their home network, including when family members are allowed to be online, and what content they’re able to access. This is not a novel concept, to be fair – numerous companies have offered internet control software in the past, and several makers of network-attached hardware exist today that can do much of what Circle with Disney can, too. For example, Circle’s device competes with newer kid-safe routers like Torch, as well as modern routers that include parental control features, like Orbi, Eero, Luma, and others. It also takes on services like OpenDNS’s family shield or even the newer parental control applications rolling out from larger companies, like Comcast’s new Xfinity xFi app, Amazon’s FreeTime, or Google’s Family Link. Like many of these devices and services, Circle with Disney allows parents to set device time limits, device “bedtimes,” configure internet and app filters, track web usage, and pause the home’s internet. In fact, Apple’s failure to address some of these parental concerns – like being able to disable internet access, or setting screen time limits – within its iOS software has left a hole in the market, allowing companies like this to emerge. iOS Screen 1 iOS Screen 2 iOS Screen 3 iOS Screen 4 iOS Screen 5  View Slideshow Previous Next Exit In addition to the basics, Circle with Disney offers ways to reward kids with screen time for doing chores, turn off distracting apps while teens are driving, and more through a “Connections” platform that works with third-party apps and services. Circle with Disney’s other advantage – as you can guess by its name – is its partnership with Disney for use of its brand name and select assets. The device includes access to short-form Disney content, like trailers, video clips, games, social media postings, GIFs, emojis, promos and more. Dozens of pieces of content are added daily, so there’s always something new to see. The $99 device is sold through Amazon, Best Buy, Target, DisneyStore.com, and Circle’s website, and it recently hit 3,700 Walmart stores in the U.S. Circle founder Jelani Memory, a former creative consultant, photographer, and videographer, declined to say how many Circle devices have been sold to date, but noted that the expansion in Walmart doubled its retail presence. Beyond the upfront purchase price, Circle Media also makes money by upgrading customers to its Circle Go subscription. This extends Circle’s feature set outside the home, including to mobile devices on cellular networks, for $9.95 per month. However, for this to work on iOS, it requires the installation of a profile on the iPhone. This can be a little tricky to set up. And, because it connects the device to a VPN in order to work, some services may be unavailable or partially disrupted when it’s installed, including Netflix, Hulu, Pokémon Go, and Ticketmaster, the company says. Others may also perform inconsistently, like iMessage, Snapchat and Instagram. This can make for a difficult upsell, obviously, and speaks to the broader issues with not having better iOS parental controls available from Apple directly. (Memory also declined to share details about conversions from device owners to subscribers.) The company says it plans to use the new funding to continue to develop the product, expand to new markets, and pursue growth. “With our current headcount at about 30 people, we have plans to double that in the next 12 months across all departments, specifically in our development teams,” notes Memory. “We’ll also be continuing to work on new product offerings that will be debuted later this year, as well as scaling into additional regions across the globe. We have currently availability in Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Netherlands, Norway and Sweden and seek to expand that. We’ll also seek to deepen our marketing spend,” he adds. “We live in an era where parents need solutions to help manage their family’s persistent access to the internet,” said Kevin Talbot, managing partner, Relay Ventures, in a statement about the firm’s investment. “As a happy Circle customer I proactively tracked them down and decided to invest because their product simply works exactly as advertised.” 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Circle Media Inc Founded 2014 Overview Circle allows your family to manage all of your home’s connected devices with ease.

Inc. is doing something most retailers wish they could do nowadays: they’re getting customers into stores. About one-third of the consumer electronics retailer’s online sales are picked up in stores, according to David Silverman, senior director of corporates at Fitch Ratings, owing to the qualities of many of the items the company is selling. Among the merchandise in Best Buy’s BBY, -2.19% inventory are large-screen televisions and cumbersome appliances. Even among some of the smaller items, there are high price tags. Many customers don’t trust an expensive item to be shipped through home-delivery channels and left on the front porch or outside an apartment door. All of the company’s big-box stores have an in-store pickup area, according to details provided by Best Buy. And about 70% of Americans live within 15 minutes of a Best Buy store. Many items can be ready for pickup within 30 minutes, and many of the big-box stores have parking set aside for customers who are going to a store for a pickup. And once customers are in the store, there’s a chance to sell them something more. “So many items sold online have periphery items customers can purchase,” Silverman said. For instance, a device might need a portable case or additional cords. “It’s certainly an opportunity to sell a related or complimentary item.” Don’t miss: Every time this happens, Amazon crushes another legacy retailer It’s an advantage that Best Buy might be able to hang on to for a while. “Big-screen TVs and refrigerators aren’t getting any smaller,” said Silverman. “The concerns will likely remain, as well as the potential theft risk.” Best Buy was the last major electronics retailer standing after the demise of Circuit City, and the bankruptcy of RadioShack, which worked in its favor. But it now faces competition from chains like Wal-Mart Stores Inc. WMT, -0.43% and Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +0.91%  that also sell consumer electronics at low prices. Plus, they’re always looking for ways to deliver more quickly and conveniently, including on the same day. Best Buy had $4.8 billion in domestic online revenue in fiscal 2017, up 21% from the previous year, according to the retailer. Online revenue in the fourth quarter was $2.3 billion, accounting for 18.6% of the company’s fourth-quarter domestic revenue. Total domestic revenue for the quarter was $12.3 billion. Read: J.C. Penney’s ‘smart’ B2B push into hotels is an encouraging sign for investors Best Buy reports first-quarter earnings on Thursday. FactSet and Estimize, a software platform that crowdsources estimates from buy-side analysts, hedge-fund managers and others, expect revenue of $8.3 billion, down from $8.6 billion a year ago. The FactSet earnings per share consensus is 40 cents, while Estimize expects EPS of 41 cents, up from 37 cents a share a year ago. While Amazon offers everything with free two-day shipping, other retailers still charge for bulky items. That means, it might not be the cost of the item but the cost to have it delivered that is prohibitive. “Buy-online-pickup-in-store in general has really taken off in the marketplace,” said Jim Prewitt, vice president of retail industry strategy at JDA Software, a retail and supply chain software company. He highlighted the “barriers” around delivering items that are large or fragile. “For a company like Best Buy to offer a full range of products online, to offer them with in-store pickup is also a benefit.” And once a big appliance, like a washer and dryer, is in your home, most people don’t want to have to deal with a return. Read also: J.C. Penney, Gymboree and J. Crew at risk - and it’s not all Amazon’s fault “There’s a factor of convenience, being able to see the product you’re buying and get one last chance to see if it’s what you want before you walk out. Perhaps talk to a salesperson and find out if you need a different cable or a stand,” said Stefan Weitz, chief strategy officer at Radial, a retail technology provider. Weitz warns against stores “bombarding” customers as they come in for a pickup in an attempt to generate an upsell. However, it’s an opportunity to have a “high-touch, high-value interaction,” no matter how brief, that will be useful to the customer. Even with the pickup advantage, Wedbush is sticking with its underperform rating on Best Buy shares. Wedbush’s price target is $29, about 48% below its current trading level. “Cost cuts and share repurchases have masked continuing revenue declines, but we expect comp declines to persist due to a lack of compelling new products while the possibility of heightened competition is a constant threat to gross margin,” analysts wrote in a Monday note. “With declining revenues and fewer cost cuts going forward, Best Buy has few levers other than buybacks to drive EPS growth in fiscal year 2018.” SunTrust Robinson Humphrey said the company had a lot of hurdles in the first quarter, including the delayed tax refund and pressure from the HHGregg Inc. HGGGQ, +13.82% going out of business sales at 220 closing stores. Fifteen percent to 20% of Best Buy’s store base is close to an HHGregg store, according to SunTrust analysts.

Local News Palm Beach County News Man accused of upskirting 'did not know that taking photos of girls was illegal', cops say A 38-year-old Chad Thomas Gorman from Lake Park is facing eight counts of video voyeurism after admitting to police to taking upskirt photos of young women at a local Walmart.   A 38-year-old Chad Thomas Gorman from Lake Park is facing eight counts of video voyeurism after admitting to police to taking upskirt photos of young women at a local Walmart.   Adam SacasaContact ReporterSun Sentinel Privacy Policy Police found more than 400 photos of women, including eight upskirt photos and a video, on the phone of a man lurking around the women’s section of a Wal-Mart, according to a Jupiter police arrest report. A security guard first noticed Chad Gorman, 34, of Lake Park, at the store at 2144 W. Indiantown Rd. late Friday afternoon as Gorman spent time walking around the women’s apparel section. The guard noticed Gorman following around young girls with the camera app open on his phone, police said. At one point, security watched as Gorman moved behind an 18-year-old wearing a green dress and took a picture from underneath her as she crouched down looking at clothing. Security called Jupiter police and when an officer arrived, he confronted Gorman about the photos. “I did not know that taking photos of girls was illegal,” Gorman told the officer, according to the report. A check of Gorman’s phone turned up “numerous photos of girls and several upskirt photos of women’s panties,” officer Christopher Morgan wrote in the arrest report. In total, investigators found 453 photos of women and a video of young girls on his phone, they said. The 18-year-old targeted for upskirting was located and told police that she wished to prosecute, the report said. Gorman told investigators he was just killing time shopping at Wal-Mart while waiting for his girlfriend to get off work, according to the report. He faces eight counts of video voyeurism and was released from the Palm Beach County Jail after posting $24,000 bond. Efforts to contact Gorman for comment Tuesday were not successful. Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office Chad Gorman, 34, of Lake Park, is accused of taking upskirt photos of women at a Walmart in Jupiter.

Watch It Out There More High Cost Worker Housing Indian Housing Dictatorship Calling The Pardini Bros Lee Is The Guy In The Photo THE FIXE IS IN Dear AVA, I consider you one of the standard bearers of the language in an age of near illiteracy and imogees. It bears mentioning however that a fixed price meal (for example at the Bewildered Pig) comes directly from the French (prix fixe or price fixed) and is pronounced pre-fix or pre-fixay, not to be confused with prefix. It makes some sense that you would assume prefix means fixed in advance, but it don't. I am an avid reader but I don't want you to have my name. Thanks for the otherwise excellent work! Name withheld Philo THE SUGGESTION BOX Esteemed Editor: I am thinking that one morning shortly after the inevitable root beer schnapps drinking jag you will feel the urge to give the AVA masthead a makeover. For your earnest consideration: "America is at last newspaper.” Retool the second line into "Peace to the Cottage Industries" and finally the sorely needed, "Fanning the flames of disenchantment." Remember if you're not going forward you are going backward. Since you are fanning some sort of flames, could you please explain why "flammable" and "inflammable" have the same meaning? A divided nation turns its lonely eyes to you — woo woo woo. As I tip on out it could be noted that any poetry in "Ukiah" is more easily seen if read in reverse. So here's my 17 syllables in the required 5-7-5 beat: Hiya Ukiah! Haiku bass ackwards. Be you A grape or a raison? Your fan, Russell Haber Gualala/Ukiah RIPPED OUT? Dear Editor, How are you doing today sir? My name is Daniel Montalvo. I am currently in the Mendocino County Jail. I am writing you because I enjoy reading your newspaper. I love how you don't leave anything out. You state the facts and tell it like it is so that people in our county know the facts on stuff that goes on in our county and in our courts. But I miss out on some of the stuff you put in the paper because some people here in the jail rip out the stuff about themselves because they are ashamed of their crimes, or they hoard the paper and I don't get a chance to see it all the time. So I want to ask you if you can send me a subscription to your newspaper so that while I’m doing my time I can stay up to date with what’s going on in the county. Daniel Montalvo County Jail, Ukiah WATCH IT OUT THERE To the Editor: Tick flagging to prevent lyme. This morning I went looking for ticks on the south end of Shakota trail at Lake Mendocino, and gathered 36 ticks in about an hour, along the trail. Last week I flagged for a bit at the north end and gathered about 32, between Pomo A and C. During the worst of my years with Lyme disease, I lost the ability to walk, went blind, and could not spell my own name. You don’t want this, and especially you don’t want it for your children. Tick flagging is a way to clear an area of the waiting ticks. I use a 3’ stick with a 2’ square of white flannel taped onto it, and brush it against the top of the grasses as I walk along, stopping frequently to remove the ticks with a piece of masking tape. And I found lots, mostly on the higher side of the trail. I think I could have gathered more except I was wearing tick repellent. Not willing to do this job without it! I use permethrin spray, (ordered from Walmart, sometimes they have it in stock. Coleman Insect Treatment, blue can). Spray it on the clothing you plan to wear, let it dry for a couple days, and it protects you for months. Don’t spray it on your skin. I spray a few pair of pants early every spring, once a year. It lasts through 4 or 5 washings. When I hike with others who aren’t wearing sprayed clothes, they come home with tick on them, and I don’t. We are at the peak of the tick season now. If you do get bit, be alert for any strange symptoms. A common one is coming home from the store and putting your shoes in the fridge and your groceries in the closet. Lyme really messes with your brain. Left untreated the lyme germs go inside the cells of your brain where antibiotics can’t easily reach. Some people get a bull’s eye rash, several days after getting infected. A rash that comes immediately after a bit however just means your body doesn’t like tick bites. After being out in pretty places, shake your clothes over the tub before you shower, and put them where any ticks can’t crawl off and come looking for you. Have a safe and beautiful spring! Marigold Klein Ukiah MORE HIGH COST WORKER HOUSING To the Editor: That which is scarce becomes dear. The Ukiah Valley is reaping what we have sown (or failed to sow) for the last several decades. For years we have made it clear that developers and their developments are not wanted ‘round these parts. As a community we have put ever more burdensome regulations and fees on new construction so little gets built and only the well heeled can afford to buy. Available housing accommodations are actually negative if you count those folks forced to live in circumstances not of their choosing, i.e. the 30-somethings living with their parents because they can’t find any other place to live. You know the situation is dire when the hospital struggles to recruit doctors because they can’t find a place they can afford. Think what it must be like for welders, teachers and hairdressers! Barring some mass exodus, the only solution to the local housing shortage is an increase in supply but years of no production housing construction has left us short of folks that know how to build production housing units. We lack the developers and trades people that can make such a project happen. Vineyard Crossing (proposed development on Lovers Lane) is such a project and Guillon Construction is such a developer. As a community we should welcome the developer and the development with open arms. That is the quickest and best path to breaking the housing log jamb we’ve spent decades creating. Ross Liberty, Factory Pipe LLC Ukiah INDIAN HOUSING DICTATORSHIP Dearest Editor: My name is Eric Lincoln. I have come across a very important and dire issue that seriously needs to be addressed. A friend of mine who is also an elder in the Indian community brought to my attention during a recent conversation a seemingly biased choice concerning him. The choice had been made by the Covelo Indian housing authority here in Covelo. Of course my friend was deeply offended by the Housing Board’s total disregard and overlooking of his and his family's needs. The outcome of the way the Indian Housing Board chose to deal with my good friend, an elder? It strengthens the views which people have to say about the Covelo Indian Housing Authority. There seems to be some truth in this. Because it has also come to my knowledge that a view of the Housing Board members are and have always been selective about who they think deserves assistance and who doesn't deserve the Housing Authority's assistance. This sounds like a [bleep]ing "dictatorship"! I mean, give me a god damn break! Any idiot and their dog should realize that special needs are a priority and must always come first — even before a family member or even a relative to anyone on the Housing Board who doesn't make it a [bleep]ing priority. But instead of the person who had come before the board with an honest heart, looking for some kind of help for himself and his family, getting help, it just gets refused and turned away while the friend, relative, family member of someone in charge gets all the assistance that he or she asked for. Choices made in that manner are not only purely unprofessional but completely biased and totally immoral. It is these kinds of cases which have to be checked into more thoroughly! For any and all of the sneaky under the table [bleep]. I'm glad my friend asked if I would write a letter about this scandalous stuff that people here in Covelo don't need to take. Stand up! Eric Lincoln Covelo PS. Regarding Officer Quilt I am writing about a tribal cop “big wig” wannabe here in Covelo who goes by the name of Quilt. I was in the tribal cop building finishing an important letter which I intended receptionist Laura Betts to document for me. I have an ongoing file there. Whenever I feel it is necessary to write a letter Laura documents it for me. So here comes Mr. Quilt in the front door of the building. He spotted me sitting at the table writing. He asked me if I made it to court? I said no, why do you ask? Get this: This “Big Wig” wannabe said he cited me for panhandling! What the hell? Maybe he thinks if he hands out a few more of those kinds of citations he’ll be eligible for vacation or something. Returning to my letterwriting, I uttered to myself, "What an Okie." Mr. Quilt’s ultrasensitive radar trained ears instantly picked up on that. So he flipped me a bitch. I said, "I'm going to cite you for that too!" Ha Ha! Like, give me a mother-bleeping break! Obviously this Quilt dude had a bad time being picked on in school as a kid. But god damn it. I was not the bully! So now that Quilt is all grown up and maybe more mature, instead of toting around his school books and his lunch money, he now totes a badge and a gun. So it seems in his childhood mentality of being picked on, it’s now his turn to be the bully. This is some serious mind game BS he is dealing with. Especially when a badge and a gun is involved — his. Retaliation from past childhood problems? This Quilt dude is supposed to be in position of so-called "authority"! Shit! Who let the dogs out? Unfortunately Mr. Blanket, oops, I mean Mr. Quilt isn't the only cop with this childhood payback mentality. Individuals like this believe that just because they carry a badge and a gun they can get away with murder. Also it is totally screwed up when the justice system finds these obviously intentional murders justifiable. They are just protecting their own. They make it seem like it's us against them and we are the bad ones. If these certain troubled cops didn't have their badges or their guns to enforce their over-abused authority, these guys would be on our own level. That being said, some of the screwed up cops are in all reality no better than you or I. So in conclusion I hope things will change for the better. That is a tall order to fill, I know, so we will see. But then again… As such, Eric Lincoln Covelo CALLING THE PARDINI BROS Editor, Where are the Republicans in this country? Why can't they stand up to these liberal Democrat scumbags? Isn’t it about time that we did something for our country? It just amazes me how they can get away with the stuff they do. Look at the 30% gas tax for instance. 30% of the gas tax that Jerry Brown raised for infrastructure is going towards a program to train criminals, felons, child molesters, ex-convicts — that's where 30% of that gas tax is going instead of infrastructure. That's Jerry Brown. That's kind of thing we got running our country. It's despicable. Why don't the Republicans have a meeting in Boonville at the fairgrounds? I will pay for it. Let's see if there's anybody left in this country who can stand up for their rights. Where are people like Kay Hiatt, Smokey Blattner, Floyd Johnson, Julie Bates, Roger Tolman, Buster Hall Hollifield, Emil Rossi and so many more that I cannot name them all. There used to be good upstanding Americans who believed in law enforcement, the Constitution and things that we really based our pride on and the fundamentals of being a good American. It just makes me sick. Take President Trump. He has done more than four months than all the rest of our presidents put together did in four years! Look at the congressional Democrats and how they are attacking him. They can't get over the fact that they lost, and they can't get over the fact that he is going to reveal how corrupt and miserable and shoddy the Democrats have been for the last eight years. It pisses a lot of these other countries off because we are not going to lay down for them like we used to do, like we did for Obama and others. We are going to stand up for our rights. It shocks them to death because they cannot understand why we are doing it. Do you know why we are doing it? Because who knows how many thousands of men and women and given their lives to keep this country free and make the United States a solid, outstanding country. Where is Tony Pardini? Where's Ernie Pardini? They have the balls to say something. And these lowlife scumbag cowardly people who enter a peaceful demonstration and cause all this damage like down in Berkeley. You know who's going to pay for that damage? You are. I am. And the rest of the people. Because Jerry Brown just loves it! He says he'll just take it out of the tax money, no problem. Yeah, that's Jerry Brown. It almost makes me sick to see those guys get away with that. I would like to take a busload of good ol’ boys from Mendocino County down there the next time they have a demonstration and see if those people show up who want to fight other people who want to peacefully demonstrate. I would love to do that. Jerry Philbrick Comptche LEE IS THE GUY IN THE PHOTO Editor, Gods Of Irony Looking Down Aghast  Subconsciously, unconsciously (whatever): immediately after your discourses on courage (and a thorough delving into the life of Rena Lynn Moore), BETWEEN that fulsome segment and the brief blast of publicity for Jeff Blankfort's photo exhibit in SF, listing his illustrious past, you neglected to mention that Lee Edmundson, one of the Democrats you chose to dis, was in fact, a 21-year old college student from the South who drove all night to be in Chicago during the disruptions of the Democratic Convention of 1968, was the young braveheart clinging out of reach on the top of the bronze statute of that civil war general, cops with batons flailing at his feet in Jeff Blankfort's iconic photograph of the revolt in Chicago the summer of '68 that landed up on the cover of Life Magazine. Lee Edmundson became one of the Chicago 6 or 7. And he is still alive and kicking. A very small-d democrat, indeed. Known locally for his vigorous contributions to our wholesome culture.

I’m eager to know. LouisBedrock Reply May 24, 2017 at 12:21 pm Save your breath and your ink, Jeff. This guy is a more vulgar Grace–and in drag: An absolute imbecile. LouisBedrock Reply May 24, 2017 at 3:27 pm Zeke wrote a hilarious response to this moron a couple of weeks ago. He congratulated Philbrick on his brilliant parody of a right wing nut. Zeke obviously wrote in jest, but I wish the missives of people like Koepf, Grace, and Philbrick were mere satire. California and New Jersey are two of the states with the greatest number of John Birchers. This country has elected Nixon twice, Reagan twice, and W twice. Trump’s re-election is not a farfetched possibility. Too many ignoramuses believe that the Navy Seals, Green Berets, and Blackwater are fighting for democracy and not for the American Empire. They are convinced of the truth of American Exceptionalism. The existence of so many people like Grace and Philbrick is in itself a rebuttal of the fantasy that there are loving gods watching over us. And it recalls a quote by Isaac Asimov that appeared in the margin of the AVA a few weeks ago: —There is a cult of ignorance in the United States and there always has been. The strain of anti-intellectualism has been a constant thread winding its way through our political and cultural life, nurtured by the false notion that “my ignorance is just as good as your knowledge.” BB Grace Reply May 24, 2017 at 12:59 pm The fact Trump makes MSM and the corrupt establishment croak is the best.

More Comments LinkedIn Tumblr Pinterest Digg FarkIt StumbleUpon Esther Brake is lovin’ it. The fired McDonald’s manager who successfully sued after she was told she’d have to take a humiliating demotion or lose her job had reason to smile. On Tuesday, Ontario’s highest court upheld a ruling by an Ottawa judge finding that the 67-year-old grandmother had been “set up to fail” and was constructively dismissed after more than 25 years working at McDonald’s restaurants in Ottawa and Newfoundland. The court of appeal also found no reason to alter the judge’s decision to order McDonald’s to pay Brake $104.499.33 — plus interest and costs — to make up for the lack of notice and damages she suffered as a result. That’s on top of the additional $120,000 the company that manages the restaurant has been ordered to pay to cover Brake’s legal costs. “I’m on top of the world,” said Brake Tuesday. “It means everything to me. I’m very, very happy that the courts took the time to listen to an individual who took a company like McDonald’s on, and we won.” Brake said she hopes the appeal court’s decision will finally end the legal saga that began in 2012 after she was told she’d have to take a demotion to first assistant or be fired. The demotion didn’t involve a reduced salary, but would require Brake to report to a much younger manager she herself had trained, along with a significant loss in benefits. The ultimatum came after Brake received her first negative performance review in November 2011 after a decade of positive assessments, court heard. Following that negative review, she was transferred from the restaurant she managed on Hazeldean Road to one of the worst performing McDonald’s in the country, located in the back corner of a Walmart store at the Kanata Centrum. Related ‘I put McDonald’s No. 1 and my family No. 2’: Ottawa woman locked in court battle over wrongful dismissal The judge found Brake was then put on a disciplinary program and subjected to performance standards that were arbitrary and unfair. Brake testified she worked 12 hours a day, seven days a week for five months. Brake achieved what the court described as “outstanding” scores compared with McDonald’s own corporate standards in customer service and quality and cleanliness, but just narrowly missed a third goal. Brake was told she had failed the program and would have to take the demotion or leave. After leaving McDonald’s, she tried to find other management jobs, but got no offers. Attempts to set up a babysitting service and work as a cleaner also failed. Eventually she took a job with Tim Hortons, and later Home Depot as a cashier. Brake said she is looking forward to her former employer finally paying up. But Brake doesn’t have any intention of quitting her current job — she had to dip into her retirement savings to survive after she left McDonald’s. “I haven’t got anything yet,” said Brake. “Yes, it’s a lot of money but at the end of the day I have to watch every cent to keep on living.” The owners of the McDonald’s franchise could still try to appeal the case to the Supreme Court of Canada, but the test for cases is stringent. Only a small percentage of cases are ever heard by the country’s top court. A lawyer representing the McDonald’s franchise didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment Tuesday. “My gut tells me this is over,” said Brake’s lawyer, Miriam Vale Peters. “Five years later she’ll see her money. That’s the reality of Esther Brake.” This is a case that I never thought would go this far Vale Peters said she never expected the case to drag on as long as it has. “This is a case that I never thought would go this far,” she said. “In my experience, 99 cases out of 100 settle. I’m surprised, and I continued to be surprised up until the day I was to be in court, that we were still there.” The court noted in an earlier decision that the judgments in the case could have been avoided if the McDonald’s offers to settle weren’t so “woefully inadequate.” Brake said people have come up to her in the Home Depot store where she works now and told her they were proud of her for taking McDonald’s to court. Brake said she feels vindicated by the decisions from the two courts. “The first thing I would tell anybody is, if they feel they are being treated unfairly — it’s a tough battle, I’m not saying it’s an easy battle — I tell them, ‘Go for it. Don’t hold back. Go for it.’ If you tell the truth, you could win.” Find National Post on Facebook Twitter Google+ Reddit Email Typo?

Among the John Brown University Enactus team's diverse portfolio of eleven projects, they focused on sharing with judges the impact of two domestic projects which have made dramatic gains over the last year. Shredify provides jobs and a steady income stream to the members of Siloam Spring's Adult Development Center through the first local, secure document-shredding enterprise for businesses and individuals. Yellow Crate enables local food pantries to send automated requests for donations through an app to individuals in their community at the point-of-purchase. The team has scaled the program in partnership with four other Enactus teams. Next stop for the team will be to represent the United States alongside 34 other countries at the 2017 Enactus World Cup Sep 26-28 in London, England. "These students are uniquely prepared for future success," says Dave Hall, president of Hallmark Cards, Inc., City Host sponsor of the Enactus United States National Exposition 2017. "They are socially conscious, business savvy and embody the entrepreneurial spirit. That is a combination you don't find in every college student, and that's what makes them so attractive to a company like Hallmark." National competition began on Monday, May 22 with teams delivering live, multi-media presentations describing their project outcomes to panels of business leaders, specifically on how the team created sustainable impact economically, socially or environmentally by using entrepreneurial action. When they were not competing, Enactus students interviewed for jobs and internships at the Enactus Career Fair where recruiters vied aggressively to attract this exceptional talent, and in many cases offered jobs on the spot. "In these three days of competition, celebration and collaboration we've seen amazing life-changing entrepreneurial action projects from 105 teams across this great country," says Alex Perwich, President, Enactus United States. "While students are working hard to impact the lives of others, they are becoming values-driven leaders in the process. We could not be prouder of them as they've inspired us and the hundreds of high-caliber judges they've shared their projects with over the last few days. Congratulations to our National Champions, John Brown University; we wish you continued success at the Enactus World Cup competition." The other teams placing in the top four were: 2nd:  La Sierra University, Riverside, CA 3rd:   Roberts Wesleyan College, Rochester, NY 4th:   Mount Mercy University, Cedar Rapids, IA About Enactus Enactus is a community of student, academic and business leaders committed to using entrepreneurial action to transform lives, improve livelihoods and shape a better, more sustainable world.

Jacquelyn Johnson Merced Sun-Star Sacto 911 Covering crime, police and courts in the Sacramento region Crime - Sacto 911 May 23, 2017 5:44 PM Tanker-truck driver killed in Atwater crash that sprayed out ‘an ocean of fire’ By Thaddeus Miller and Rob Parsons and Vikaas Shanker tmiller@mercedsunstar.com ATWATER A tanker truck loaded with thousands of gallons of fuel raced off Highway 99 in Atwater on Tuesday morning, overturned and burst into flames, spraying waves of fire at least 25 feet wide. The driver of the 2008 Peterbilt truck never made it out. His body was found inside the burned out truck cab. His name was not released Tuesday. Jeanine Jaroszek was buying coffee around 10:00 a.m. with her twin teenage daughters at Starbucks on Bell Lane, just off Highway 99. She said she looked out the store window and saw “an ocean of fire that crashed in waves down the road.” “I looked up and there was this fire like a wall and then we heard the explosion — the first explosion,” she said. “I’ve never seen fire move like that.” What followed, she said, was chaos as people scrambled out of businesses and fast food restaurants. “There was shouting and people yelling to get out of the building,” Jaroszek said. As they scrambled to get away, Jaroszek said, she and her two daughters became separated. They stayed in touch by cellphone. A Starbucks employee, who was putting her own children in a car, also took Jaroszek’s girls away from the fiery, smoke-filled scene. They met up with their mother down the road. “It was very scary,” Jaroszek said. “It looked like a terrorist attack or something.” She said she heard “at least” two explosions. Video captured by Charlene Goodman, who was at the nearby Wal-Mart, appeared to record at least five explosions. Fuel truck burning in #Atwater pic.twitter.com/f6whWk7A6W— Thaddeus Miller (@thaddeusmiller) May 23, 2017 Mark Lawson, division chief with Calfire-Merced County, said the tanker truck was carrying about 9,000 gallons of gasoline on a delivery to the Arco gas station on Bell Lane. He said authorities fear the leaking truck may have dumped about 1,000 gallons of fuel into the gutter and that fuel may make its way into a drinking-water supply. The cause of the crash the explosion remains under investigation, according to Officer Eric Zuniga of the California Highway Patrol. Witnesses told investigators the truck, which was coming from Stockton, may already have been on fire around 10:02 a.m. when it left the freeway onto the Bell Lane exit. It reportedly overturned while exiting, Zuniga said, causing the trailer to “whip” behind the truck and into the onramp side of Bell Lane. “We don’t know how fast he was going, but it was probably a little too fast for that turn,” he said. Driver killed in #Atwater truck fire pic.twitter.com/QZY52PHWFb— Thaddeus Miller (@thaddeusmiller) May 23, 2017 The force of the explosion was felt by numerous people in fast-food restaurants in the area. Multiple cars and trucks sustained heat damage, and many were described by authorities as “scorched” as a result of the blast. A large plume of thick black smoke could be seen for several miles and was reported as far away as at least Delhi to the north and Merced to the south. Related stories from The Sacramento Bee Driver killed when tanker truck crashes and catches fire near Applegate Road and Highway 99 in Atwater Highway 99 was open again as of 12:15 p.m., but the exit off Bell Lane remains closed. Authorities said the clean up is likely to take at least two days. Between 200 and 300 people had to leave the area as 25 to 30 feet of flames crawled along Bell Lane. The heat also melted a sign roughly 100 feet above the crash. Trees along Bell Lane were burned black, and McDonald’s northern wall was charred. The longer term effects of the crash could be wide-ranging, officials said. There were reports of gas leaks and city leaders fear it could be several days before businesses in the area are allowed to reopen. It was a 25-foot wall of fire. Nobody (else) is hurt? It’s pretty amazing. Paul Creighton, an Atwater councilman Students rehearsing their graduation ceremony Tuesday morning at Atwater Community High School were sent home. Their graduation ceremony has been postponed for the time being, according to Nathan Quevedo, spokesman for the Merced County Office of Education. “The explosion was so close the students could feel it,” Quevedo said. “The air quality was just so bad out there.” Fernando Soria, 17, said smoke blacked out the sky. “It sounded like bombs, like from (a video game), boom, boom, boom,” he said. Less than half a mile away from the explosions, Landmark Christian School's classes halted and students came outside. “It was close enough that the windows were all vibrating,” Principal Marvin Waddel said. “Initially, we did see the explosion. It was a distraction and disrupted class for a little bit.” Waddel said classes resumed Tuesday and students were kept inside to avoid any smoke inhalation. Atwater Mayor Jim Price, who surveyed the scene in person, said the Panda Express restaurant will likely be closed for at least two days. City officials will work to open up the other businesses in the area, he said. “I’m sure there is going to be a cost,” he said. “Our main concern is with the deceased.” The 2008 Peterbilt truck was carrying about 9,000 gallons of gasoline on a delivery to the Arco gas station on Bell Lane Authorities said they need to examine the power grid in that area, the road structure and also confirm whether the fuel leaked into any water supply. Multiple first responders expressed relief that there weren’t more injuries in the blast. Atwater Councilman Paul Creighton also arrived to the scene. He said he wanted to check on the Atwater police who responded to the area. “It was a 25-foot wall of fire,” he said. “Nobody (else) is hurt. It’s pretty amazing.” Thaddeus Miller: 209-385-2453, @thaddeusmiller The California Highway Patrol, Atwater Fire Department and the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, Merced County, respond to the scene of a tanker truck fire near Applegate Road and Highway 99 in Atwater, Calif., on Tuesday, May, 23, 2017.

Continue Reading Below Those workers, who marched in the rain Tuesday evening, filling more than two blocks of downtown Chicago's Michigan Avenue ahead of a McDonald's Corp. shareholders meeting, have become the new face of the labor movement as they push for a $15-an-hour minimum wage. The question is whether they'll become the new face of union membership. Labor organizations' "Fight for $15" strategy, led by the Service Employees International Union, primarily benefits low-wage workers rather than traditional union members, such as manufacturing laborers, public-school teachers and nurses. "The SEIU is groping towards a new model -- trying to come up with other ways of helping workers beyond their own narrow membership," said Harry Holzer, a Georgetown University public-policy professor who worked in the Labor Department during the Bill Clinton administration. The Fight for $15 "helps raise the union's profile and their political clout. It also raises the question of: How are they going to pay for it?" Dwindling union membership and tight budgets for organized labor could make it difficult to support an effort that yields little benefit to most union workers, who typically earn well more than $15 an hour. The median weekly earnings for a full-time union worker last year was $1,004, or about $25 an hour, according to Labor Department data. Median earnings of nonunion workers was $802 a week. Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT The Fight for $15, which emerged in late 2012 from a New York gathering of fast-food workers and SEIU organizers, has been successful. Two of the most populous states, California and New York, are on the path to reach a $15-an-hour minimum, as are more than a dozen cities, including Seattle and Washington, D.C. And employers including Aetna Inc. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. have pledged to lift starting pay for workers -- all while the federal pay floor has remained $7.25 an hour since 2009. Protesters finalized their plans in the basement of a Chicago pizzeria in the hours before Tuesday's protest. Bettie Douglas, 59 years old, asked fellow fast-food workers half her age to excuse her language before she uttered, "I'm very angry -- I'm pissed off." The St. Louis McDonald's worker said she is upset that state lawmakers may soon strip her of a minimum-wage increase enacted just weeks ago in the city. She said fast-food workers need a union to give them a better voice with politicians and corporations. "You can't live on $7.90 an hour," Ms. Douglas said. "They can afford to do better by us." The SEIU sent more than $16 million last year to about a dozen regional organizing committees and a related public-relations firm to run Fight for $15 activities, according to filings with the Labor Department. It has spent similar amounts each year since 2013, a sizable portion of its roughly $300 million annual budget. And those amounts don't include millions more spent on everything from legal fees to international organizing efforts that may also benefit the Fight for $15 campaign. The stated goal of Fight for $15 protesters is "$15 and a union." They've had far more success with $15. The movement has yet to yield any new dues-paying members in the fast-food industry. When Fight for $15 launched in November 2012 with worker protests in New York, a $15 minimum wage was far from mainstream. Even in initial meetings, some fast-food workers argued a $10 hourly wage was more realistic. President Barack Obama called for just a $9-an-hour federal minimum in February 2013. "These workers were told they were crazy," said Kendall Fells, the Fight for $15 organizing director who is on loan to the campaign from the SEIU. Now a $15 minimum wage is part of the Democratic platform. But the Fight for $15 has mostly stayed away from candidates. It didn't mobilize to back Hillary Clinton last year, instead keeping its focus on wages. And there lies one paradox of the fight. Mrs. Clinton's failure to win the presidency could be a blow to the ability of franchise employees to bargain directly with big companies -- the mechanism that would allow for fast-food workers to unionize. During the Obama administration, rulings from the National Labor Relations Board opened the door for national brands to potentially be considered jointly responsible for employees at franchised operations. That is a critical step to entering collective bargaining with a company like McDonald's. That still-untested pathway is likely to close. President Donald Trump is expected to appoint regulators who will favor businesses over union organizers. The Fight for $15 may not stay on the political sidelines next time, Mr. Fells said. Fast-food workers and allies marched in red Fight for $15 ponchos and purple SEIU jackets past Trump International Hotel & Tower in Chicago to a landmark McDonald's restaurant Tuesday, an attempt to tie Mr. Trump to the plight of low-wage workers. That helped attract Black Lives Matter and Women's March protesters to join the march. A White House spokesman said the president is committed to supporting policies that help low-wage workers achieve increased success and economic prosperity. A McDonald's spokeswoman didn't directly address the planned protests but said Monday that the company is committed to providing jobs and training to thousands of Americans, many of whom are entering the labor force for the first time. In 2015, the company raised starting pay for workers at its company-owned stores, a fraction of all McDonald's locations, to at least a dollar above the local minimum wage. Earlier this month, McDonald's said it would provide assistance to franchisees to pay for self-order kiosks and table-locator technology that make employees more efficient at serving customers. The SEIU expects that the wage movement will eventually lead to unionized workers. It sees organization of the low-wage food-service industry as the way to reverse the trend of declining union membership. Employment at fast-food restaurants grew twice as fast as overall payrolls last year. Union membership, meanwhile, has declined as a share of the workforce for three decades. "The problem for the union is when dues collected from collective bargaining is your only revenue source, a social movement like Fight for $15 transfers money from your members to a broad-based fight," said Andy Stern, the former SEIU president who left the union in 2010. "You need a different business model." SEIU President Mary Kay Henry said Fight for $15 remains a high priority for the union, and it will cut costs elsewhere to ensure it is funded. Setting $15 as a national benchmark helped SEIU-represented nursing home workers in Chicago and hospital workers in Baltimore bargain to lift their starting wages to $15 as well, she said in an interview. The Fight for $15 makes "the labor movement understand that you can make a bold demand," she said. "Demands that actually are going to change people's lives."

Greybull, a member of the Dakota Tribe and former U.S. Army soldier, was an organizer of the 2010 event. Photo by Jay Mann/courtesy US Army via Flickr The Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma has launched a lawsuit against three national retail pharmacy chains and two of the largest national drug distributors in the country. The complaint charges that they knowingly flooded the tribal community with prescription opioids, fueling a deadly drug epidemic that has taken hundreds of lives and cost hundreds of millions of dollars. The landmark lawsuit, filed on April 20, 2017, contends that retailers Walmart, CVS and Walgreens, and wholesalers AmerisourceBergen, McKesson, and Cardinal Health, “allowed massive amounts of opioid pills to be diverted from legitimate channels of distribution into the illicit black market in quantities that have fueled the opioid epidemic in the Cherokee Nation.  The suit alleges the defendants ignored red flags and “turned a blind eye” to known problems in their supply chains. Todd Hembree, the Cherokee Nation Attorney General, said the drug companies failed to keep their opioids from being diverted and did nothing to prevent rampant over-prescribing. The rate of drug-related deaths among American Indian and Alaska Native people has quadrupled since 1999 and is double the rate of the country as a whole. The diversion of millions of opioid pills over the past 18 years has contributed to nearly 400 deaths among the Cherokee Nation – double the death rate of the country at large – and 10,000 hospital visits.  Actions like the Cherokee suit can be expensive—especially if you lose and have to cover the legal expenses. Despite this, considering the social destruction that prescription opioids have caused the American Indian and Alaska Native populations, it’s possible we will see other tribal nations follow with their own lawsuits. Drug companies are complicit in the opioid epidemic, and they need to be held accountable. The reason: there’s strength in numbers. Similar lawsuits have snowballed among cities, counties and states, where opioid addiction has cost taxpayers and citizens billions of dollars. From coast to coast, they’ve come to the same conclusion: Drug companies are complicit in the opioid epidemic, and they need to be held accountable. The combined pressure is starting to have an effect. Recent federal cases against drug companies show that lobbyists and armies of lawyers are getting companies off rather lightly. “They pay fines as a cost of doing business in an industry which generates billions of dollars in revenue,” the Cherokee suit says. The pharmaceutical industry has to start paying for its lack of responsibility. Light fines and no jail time helps fuel the problem. The industry has to start paying for its lack of responsibility. I support the Nation’s suit, but much more legal pressure is needed.  Almost every day we see new state, county and city laws and statutes that increase funding for local treatment and law enforcement. At the federal level, the new 21st Century Cures Act has allocated the first half of a $1-billion grant to the states and territories for drug treatment, law enforcement and prevention programs. Another important piece of federal legislation is the Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA). Enacted in 2013 and set for completion in 2024, the DSCSA helps ensure prescription drugs get to where they are supposed to go. Right now, drug companies are scrambling to be in compliance by November, when on-pack label serialization and tamper-evident packaging must be in use to prevent theft and counterfeiting. These new requirements are going to make a difference.  All of this is helping. But for communities like the opioid-devastated Cherokee Nation, it’s mostly too little too late. In the tribal communities, which are at high risk for substance use disorders, local governments need to expand education, treatment and prevention programs now. We need insurance regulations that add to, not take away from, coverage for treatment of substance use disorders. And we need more access to medically supervised detox programs that help ease the pain and discomfort of prescription opioid withdrawal. These encourage people to attempt recovery, not avoid it. With more effective drug detox, rehab and support programs, we can greatly reduce relapse rates and enjoy successful long-term recovery. I urge healthcare leaders and lawmakers everywhere to strengthen and more rigorously enforce all regulations that pertain to drug diversion. We must hold manufacturers, distributors and pharmacies responsible for the failures in the supply chain that lead to illicit diversion. I heartily applaud the Cherokee Nation for its preemptive actions to deter diversion. They have implemented their own prescription monitoring program, and eliminated some of the most widely abused opioids from their own formulary.  As an executive deeply involved in the world of drug and alcohol recovery, I have been outraged many times over the past 10 or so years as drug company after drug company has been charged with breaches of the law, brought to court, found guilty and paid enormous fines—from hundreds of millions to even billions of dollars—only to return to the same pattern of behavior as before No one of consequence is ever jailed. Bryn Wesch We deal with the results of the opioid epidemic on a daily basis. We see and hear first-hand how these situations of dependence and addiction can develop, regardless of age or station in life, and so often from a single pill or two or three, usually borrowed or innocently gifted. Every day we hear how opioids—meant to relieve pain—can ruin lives. It is critical that we take immediate action to prevent further loss of life, deteriorating health issues and increased economic consequences. Bryn Wesch is Chief Financial Officer at Novus Medical Detox Center, a Joint Commission Accredited inpatient medical detox facility that is also licensed by the Florida Department of Children and Families and known for minimizing the discomfort of withdrawal from prescription medication, drugs or alcohol.

Roskam Sees Tax Reform Passing This Year House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady said he’s open to reviewing parts of the House Republican tax blueprint as Congress looks for a path forward on trying to make U.S. businesses more competitive globally -- even as Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin offered his most direct criticism of the plan yet. “We know there are legitimate concerns -- including from some of our witnesses here today and our colleagues on the other side of the aisle -- about how it will affect American workers, businesses, and consumers,” Brady said Tuesday during a more than three-hour hearing to discuss a controversial proposal for a border-adjusted tax on imports. Afterward, Brady told reporters that a key point is to “address this transition and design in a way that eliminates those uncertainties and creates that good solid deliberate approach going forward.” Still, little consensus emerged from the hearing, which featured testimony from Target Corp. Chief Executive Officer Brian Cornell, who’s been fighting along with other retailers and import-heavy industries to kill the proposal. One of the witnesses opposing Cornell was Bill Simon, a former top executive for Wal-Mart Stores Inc., who recently called the retail industry “hysterical” on the issue. As witnesses debated such fine points as the BAT proposal’s effects on consumer prices and the strength of the dollar, Mnuchin sounded a clear warning about the measure during a separate appearance in Washington. “One of the problems with the border-adjusted tax is that it doesn’t create a level playing field,” said Mnuchin, who is playing a key role in shaping legislation with the House and Senate. “It has very different impacts on different companies, it has the potential to pass on significant costs to the consumer, it has the potential of moving the currencies.” ‘If’ Refrain The House Republican leaders’ tax plan depends in part on taxing U.S. companies’ domestic sales and imported goods while exempting exports. The concept has faced resistance from President Donald Trump’s top economic advisers as well as criticism among Senate Republicans. Mnuchin said during a meeting Tuesday with members of the House Freedom Caucus that he and Trump are inclined to oppose the border-adjusted tax, according to two people familiar with the conversation who asked not to be identified because the meeting was private.

Sign Up During the hearing, Cornell said the most repeated word was “if” -- in reference to uncertainty about how currency markets would react, the effect the plan would have on consumer prices and the impact more expensive imports would have on business models for different industries. During his opening statement, Cornell said Target’s tax rate would jump to 75 percent from 35 percent, potentially jeopardizing a planned $7 billion investment plan. “It’s really hard for me to sit here today and craft a business plan,” Cornell said, “when I sit here today and keep hearing if.” The measure’s supporters say it would lead to a strengthening dollar, which would even out its effect on the price of imported goods. Simon made clear that a border-adjusted tax would need to be implemented carefully to avoid damaging retailers and raising consumer prices. “If we take the time and do the work and sit down in a group and iron out, lay out what it will look like, I think it will be very successful” for U.S. manufacturing without harming other sectors, Simon said. Still, Simon warned if the transition rules weren’t done correctly, there could be a slowdown in some imports. Republican Opposition Republican lawmakers including Jim Renacci of Ohio and Mike Kelly of Pennsylvania criticized the border-adjusted tax’s potential impact on working Americans. Representative Lloyd Doggett, a Texas Democrat, said the BAT is already on “life support.” “There were considerable concerns raised by several Republicans on the committee and all Democrats,” said Brian Dodge, senior executive vice president for public affairs at the Retail Industry Leaders Association, which opposes the BAT. “Anyone who watched this hearing looking to understand if and how this would work in the real world could only be left deeply deeply concerned.” House Speaker Paul Ryan said May 18 that a border-adjusted tax “should have some kind of an adjustment and phase-in period.” Importers have brought some suggestions to the Ways and Means committee, such as tax credits for assembly in the U.S. and different ways to phase in the tax on goods brought into the country, Brady told reporters after the hearing. Retail Meeting The retail lobby, however, has said it opposes BAT in any form. A group of CEOs from companies that are members of the National Retail Federation is scheduled to meet with Mnuchin and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross on Wednesday as part of its lobbying effort against BAT this week, according to BJ’s Wholesale Club Inc. CEO Chris Baldwin who is part of the contingent.  Analysis done by BJ’s shows border adjustment would quadruple its federal tax bill to more than 80 percent, Baldwin said.  “Ultimately because this will result in significant price increases on important goods and services to consumers, I don’t see how slowing it makes it any better,” Baldwin said. “Consumers will bare the brunt of this change, whether they do it today or over a period of time.” The border adjustment portion of the House leaders’ tax plan is estimated to raise more than $1 trillion in new revenue over the next decade -- helping to pay for cuts to the corporate and individual income-tax rates that the GOP also wants. Writing a revenue-neutral tax bill is important to Republicans, who plan to move the legislation through the Senate without any Democratic votes. To achieve that aim, Senate rules require that the bill can’t increase the federal deficit in the long run. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

A new way to play tech’s comeback. Also recommended: Deep-sea killing machines rattle U.S. military officials. As you may know, earnings season officially came to a close last week with a quarterly report from Wal-Mart Stores Inc. And it’s now clear that American companies — and investors — have plenty to get excited about. According to Bespoke Investment Group, 61% of companies beat analyst estimates for earnings — right in line with the historical average. But more importantly, 63% of companies have beat top-line estimates this season. At this pace, this quarter could see the largest revenue beat rate since Q4 2014. And as Jonathan Rodriguez points out, one sector is leaving the rest of the market in the dust… Ahead of the tape, Louis Basenese Chief Investment Strategist, Wall Street Daily Time to Stack Your Deck With Tech Stocks What a difference six months make… On Nov. 9, the day after Donald Trump was elected president, the stock market exploded. The Dow added 257 points after diving nearly 900 points overnight. And on hopes of tax cuts, infrastructure spending and industry deregulation, the market’s biggest laggards quickly became the stars of 2016: financials, materials and health care stocks. Furthermore, the market’s strongest sector by far — technology — fell 3% in the week after the election, while the S&P 500 rose 2%. It was quite a reversal. But as this earnings season — the first of Trump’s presidency — has proved so far to investors, it doesn’t always pay to jump the gun… According to data from the number crunchers at Bespoke Investment Group, 73% of tech stocks beat analyst earnings estimates. That’s eight percentage points higher than the current beat rate for all stocks (65%). And FactSet notes that 72% of tech firms in the S&P 500 beat revenue estimates, too. These results have investors thinking twice about running for the exits on tech… Sellers Remorse? Since the start of the year, XLK — the ETF that tracks large-cap tech stocks — is up 14%. That’s twice the gain of the S&P 500 over the same period. Exclusive Content The $100 Trump Retirement Roadmap Trump is set to unleash a $11.1 trillion tsunami in the markets… Now that he's officially taken office, dozens of tiny firms could skyrocket by 100%, 300% and even 721%. This is your chance to turn a small stake of $100… into a life-changing fortune. Click here to find out how. What about the “Trump trade” darlings of late 2016? Not so hot… Health care names have gained 10% on the year. But materials have gained 5%, and financials are up less than 1%. While it’s true that many individual tech stocks sport hefty valuations, the tech sector at large trades at just 18 times forward earnings — 25% below the S&P. And with billions in cash on hand, tech firms will continue to reward shareholders with buybacks, dividends and takeovers that supercharge growth. Better still, if you were one of the hasty investors who dumped their tech stocks for Trump trade stocks… you’re in luck. Here’s a small-cap tech name that could help supercharge your 2017 returns… Cleaning up Shop Ultra Clean Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: UCTT) is a tech firm that specializes in manufacturing semiconductor capital equipment. Put simply, Ultra Clean makes the machines that tech device-makers use to craft semiconductor components for their products. And though the company is a rising star in the semiconductor manufacturing space, Ultra Clean is still one of the smallest — boasting a market cap of just $750 million. After a prolonged downturn in the semiconductor industry, business is now booming… The company booked $205 million in revenue in the first quarter — a 69% increase from the same period last year. For the full fiscal year 2016, sales rose 20% from the previous year, to $563 million. Management reported adjusted earnings of 47 cents, versus analyst estimates of 42 cents. That represents an upside surprise of 12%. Ultra Clean trades at 0.9 enterprise value to sales — a 74% discount to the peer average. Shares also trade at 11.8 times forward earnings — a 41% discount to the industry (19.9) and 62% below tech stocks overall (30.9). And fiscal 2017 earnings are forecast to nearly triple from last year. In fact, the stock could easily add another 10% through the end of the year simply by applying the stock’s five-year P/E multiple (13.3) to full-year earnings. Over the last year, shares have soared to an all-time high as Ultra Clean’s fundamentals improve. The stock is up 309% over the last year. That’s eight times small-cap tech stocks and 13 times the rise of the S&P 600. In short, the company is on fantastic financial footing, and the stock is in a solid uptrend. Bottom line: Tech stocks are primed to soar this year as earnings improve and investors rush to buy back shares they sold off after the election. And Ultra Clean represents one of the sector’s hottest momentum stocks, backed by a rock-solid balance sheet.

No news? — Jim G., Central Point Yes, you heard right, Jim. Five Guys, the popular hamburger chain, was looking at a location in Medford. In February 2016, Medford's Site Plan & Architectural Commission considered plans for a Five Guys Burgers & Fries restaurant on the east side of Center Drive, about 1,000 feet north of Garfield Street, according to plans submitted to the commission. The restaurant was planned for Southgate Center across from the Walmart Superstore, according to the plans. Other nearby businesses include Farmer’s Insurance, Northwest Community Credit Union and The RRRink. The proposed building was designed to be 4,100 square feet, and the site plan called for 25 added parking spaces and two bicycle racks.  City planning staff recommended approval for the site plan. Unfortunately, the location didn't work out. "Five Guys pulled out of Center Drive, but they're looking at other options around town," said Sam Barnum, city building director. So, Jim, it looks like you'll have to be a little more patient before the famous hamburger chain comes to town. Five Guys opened its first location in 1986 in Arlington, Virginia, according to the company’s website. It has since opened more than 1,000 restaurants in 47 U.S. states and six Canadian provinces. Reportedly there are “over 250,000 possible ways to order a burger” at the restaurant, the site says. — Send questions to “Since You Asked,” Mail Tribune Newsroom, P.O.

Among them, the driver of an ice cream truck cited for under the influence of drugs and a needle found in a children's shoe rack at WalMart. A former MU football player has pleaded guilty to heroin distribution from his dorm room, too. The shoe needle raises further precautions for parents who acknowledge this could have been at a playground. Caregivers and parents have new concerns --- they might need to check public playing areas BEFORE allowing their children to play, especially in the hot weather which leans toward uncovered attire such as bare feet, flimsy flip flops, sleeveless shirts and shorts. Freelance writer/musician David Williams, who's also a substance abuse counselor, penned the lyrics for a song chronicling Huntington's drug epidemic , woes, and challenges to overcome. HOPINGTON They busted the ice cream man with heroin last night, And they towed his truck too,  There's pictures on the net taken at Walmart,  Of a syringe inside a pair of shoes, There's addicts dying all over town,  But the Mayor's accepting awards, Arguing over if addiction is a disease we are headed for a social civil war The poison is spreading, patience is thin This is a battle we have to win We have to make our city great again Grace is needed to erase all sin Like Rocky Meadows said,  It's not Moneyton It's Hopington Heroin took Bobby's job and money away It left him with kind of debts a soul can't pay He was found in a ditch on the side of a street They put him in recovery and he got back on his feet He was down  He got up again Grace is needed to erase all sin Let's come together my friends This ain't Moneyton No it's not Moneyton It's Hopington It's Hopington If your looking for help it's not hard to find There's good people happy to share their time If you need a helping hand you can find a friend Because this ain't Moneyton it's Hopington The poison is spreading, patience is thin  This is a battle we must win Got to make our city great again Like Rocky Meadows said This ain't Moneyton It's Hopington Hopington   THE IMAGERY BELOW ILLUSTRATES THE REPEATED RESPONSE OF FIRST RESPONDERS THROUGHOUT THE CITY. LOCATIONS WILL NOT BE IDENTIFIED NO WILL ORIGINAL FB POSTERS. ALL COME FROM DAVID WILLIAM'S PAGE.  Williams added: "the media and recovery workers will embrace King Kool the way they have prostitute Lisa Stone and encourage him to seek recovery. King Kool had a high profile arrest like Stone and public hit rock bottom. The media and recovery personnel were there to help Lisa Stone and I believe she is still recovering in Louisville. It would be great if King Kool could get the same opportunity. Not only could these two get the help they need but also become the face of hope for those addicted in Huntington. Their recoveries could bring much needed inspiration to those thinking about recovery." Tweet Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

ON AIR NOW12:00 AM - 5:00 AMCoast to Coast Abandoned barn destroyed in southeast Edmonton fire Caley Ramsay May 23, 2017 04:14 pm WATCH ABOVE: Video of the fire from the Global 1 news helicopter between 4:30 p.m. and 5 p.m. Tuesday. An abandoned barn was destroyed in a fire in southeast Edmonton on Tuesday afternoon. Firefighters were called to the area of Whitemud Drive and 17 Street, behind a nearby Walmart, at around 4:10 p.m. Video from the Global 1 news helicopter showed firefighters dousing the barn and surrounding grass at around 4:30 p.m. Large plumes of grey smoke filled the air. District chief Terry Krucik said when firefighters arrived, the barn was engulfed in flames and the fire was spreading towards the train tracks. “It was actually at the tracks. The guys were able to get it under control there with the use of our all-terrain pumpers,” he said. “It started in the farm yard and moved toward the tracks. “This is an abandoned farm property. It’s actually scheduled to be demolished. There was no one living there at the time, but there was still active power, gas and septic systems that we had to look out for.” Thirty-two firefighters were involved in battling the blaze, which was brought under control shortly after 5:30 p.m. Krucik said the hot weather was tough on fire crews as the temperature hovered around the 29 C mark at the time. “Our firefighters are more used to cold weather than hot weather, so it took a round out of them,” he said. “All firefighters are checked out by EMS upon exiting the fire and we’ve had no injuries.” Traffic heading east on the Whitemud was moving slowly at around 5 p.m. The cause of the fire is under investigation. This was the scene of a fire on the southeast side of the city at around 4:40. Crews still on-scene fighting the blaze. @GlobalEdmonton pic.twitter.com/CR0rHOyPTr — Lauren Fink (@LaurenFink_) May 23, 2017 Kirby Bourne Trending More Latest More Vancouver Traffic Tweets by @AM730Traffic Current Traffic Incidents You May Also Like More News Who should the Green party side with in forming government? 1 hour ago There will be plenty of hard bargaining going on behind the scenes over the next week, as the BC Liberals...

Getty Images MORE FROM: Keith J. Kelly Editor of Jared Kushner's Observer Media has resigned Hamptons magazine business heats up as summer approaches Rolling Stone founder Jann Wenner's bio set for fall release TheStreet editor in chief jumps ship American Media launching 'high-quality' branded content studio Despite its bumpy ride with Dr. Oz The Good Life, Hearst is plunging ahead with two new test launches. The latest on tap is Ree Drummond’s new magazine, Pioneer Woman, debuting June 6. It will be sold only in Walmart stores. The publisher hopes that Drummond’s popular cooking show and her blog — which snags 23 million page views per month — translates into a magazine success story. It is the second test issue to launch from Hearst in recent weeks. The test launch of the travel title Airbnbmag hit this week. Joint ventures hold down launch costs, but TV success is not an automatic pass to success. Dr. Oz The Good Life moved to 950,000 circulation at 10 times a year at the start of the year, but poor ad support caused the company to cut back to a quarterly “bookazine” earlier this month. Vicki Wellington, who is also publisher of Food Network Magazine as well as Pioneer Woman, says of Drummond: “She never wrote a business plan on how to be a success. She’s basically been operating from the heart.” In her first meeting at the Hearst Tower in September, Drummond wore cowboy boots, Wellington said. Drummond married Ladd Drummond and moved to his sprawling Oklahoma ranch when she began doing a mom blog on cooking, country life and family in 2006 that soon gained a national following. Her blog eventually turned into a guest appearance on Bobby Flay’s cooking show and eventually her own Food Network show and a bestselling cook book. Wellington said the first test issue has 35 ad pages. “It sold out very quickly,” she said. “I had to turn people away.” The company is only distributing 150,000 copies of the first issue. The second test issue, scheduled for September, will broaden out beyond the Walmart chain, said Wellington.

I-10 at Rexville Road was still shut down until early this morning after the storm downed power lines and overturned an 18-wheeler on the highway, just west of Highway 36. Traffic was backed up for miles behind the closure on both eastbound and westbound lanes as police refused to allow drivers to go backwards to exit the highway. "The car started shaking from the wind," said Yolanda Rico, who was stranded on I-10 for eight hours. "The rain started to hit, and couldn't see in front of us. Pulled over."

It doesn’t end well. Sarah Taylor May 23, 2017 8:05 pm An angry white woman goes off on a racial rant against a Latina woman and a black woman. (Image Source: Twitter Video screenshot) 209 Follow Share Tweet A video of an unnamed, angry white Walmart shopper — reportedly from Centerton, Ark. — using racial epithets directed at both black and Latino women went viral after it was shared Monday on Facbeook. Eva Hicks, the Latina woman accosted by the white woman, was looking for medicine and reportedly asked the white woman to move out of her way, politely saying, “Excuse me.” The white woman in the video began shouting at Hicks to “go back to where you came from” and suggested that the Latina woman “leave America.” A black woman intervened, and the white woman advised the black woman to “stay out of it.” The unidentified black woman told the white woman that she wanted the white woman to “stop being ignorant,” and then things got even uglier. “A n****r’s calling me ignorant?” the white woman asked, and turned her attentions back to Hicks, who she once again told to leave the country. “This is my country!” the white woman continued to yell until management stepped in. “We don’t want you here!” she added. When the store manager intervened, he advised the white woman that Hicks had every right to be there and asked the white woman to vacate the premises. Sharing the video on her Facebook, Hicks wrote, “I never in my life thought this would happen to me. Just on a simple trip to the grocery store after a hard day of work. I love this country and I will stay in this country.” A spokesperson for Walmart tweeted on Tuesday that they do not condone racial or discriminatory behavior in any way, shape or form. Walmart’s statement read: “We value and respect everyone who visits our stores. We have no tolerance for the language or actions of this customer and are proud that our assistant manager responded appropriately by asking her to leave the store.” Share Tweet 209 Comments Get TheBlaze Newsletters Sign Up Refer Friends to TheBlaze!

When it comes to government policies interfering with market prices, the GOP has loudly denounced everything from caps on oil prices that caused the gas lines during the Carter administration to the numerous ObamaCare price controls producing disastrous results. They have argued correctly that price controls always result in product shortages and other negative results for consumers. Given this history, House GOP members should be rushing to repeal a price control measure sponsored by Sen. Dick DurbinDick DurbinDem senators accuse Trump of purposefully holding back information The GOP must fight against the Durbin amendment's price controls It’s time to rethink prisoner re-entry MORE (D-Ill.) back when he was Senate Majority Whip. The Durbin amendment of the infamous 2010 Dodd-Frank financial “reform” law slapped price controls on the fees that banks and credit unions charge retailers to process debit card purchases. Now, debit card issuers must charge prices the Federal Reserve defines as “reasonable and proportional to the cost.” ADVERTISEMENT On top of that, costs that these fees can cover are only “incremental costs,” a definition that leaves out most fixed costs like computer hardware and software used to process the card transactions. Not only are banks and credit unions forbidden to make a profit on the debit card fees they charge to retailers, they can’t even cover all their costs. Talk about picking winner and losers.   In the House, Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling (R-Texas) is spearheading a plan, the Financial Choice Act, which repeals these price controls as well as other provisions in Dodd-Frank that are harmful to community banks, credit unions, and consumers. Earlier this month, Hensarling’s committee voted to approve the bill, but some GOP lawmakers are reportedly trying to drop the Durbin repeal provision from the bill before it comes to a House floor for a vote. Why? Well, it may have something to do with strong lobbying from multibillion-dollar corporations lobbying hard to keep getting ill-gotten gains from Durbin Amendment price controls. Big retailers like Walmart and Home Depot have reaped a windfall from not having to pay the full cost of processing debit card purchases. The Electronic Payments Coalition, a group representing payment card networks, banks, and credit unions of all sizes, calculates from Federal Reserve data that retailers have taken in $42 billion from the Durbin amendment. A Home Depot executive bragged on a stock analysts’ conference call that price controls could add up to $35 million per year to the chain’s bottom line. If the Durbin amendment explicitly bars banks and credit unions from recouping the full cost of a debit card transaction from a retailers, who pays these costs? Consumers. The costs have been shifted to them in the form of reduced benefits, like free checking, and higher fees at their banks and credit unions. In 2009, the year before Dodd-Frank was enacted, 76 percent of checking accounts were free of charge. By 2011, this share had fallen to 45 percent, and by 2012 to 39 percent, according to Bankrate.com. Service charges on non-interest bearing checking accounts have also increased dramatically. A 2014 George Mason University study calculates that the Durbin Amendment contributed to 1 million Americans losing access to the banking system — becoming “unbanked” — by 2011. And the savings on retail goods and services that retailers said would be passed on to consumers turned out to be miniscule or nonexistent. Even accounting for some lower prices in highly competitive markets, the public still suffered a net welfare loss of $22 to $25 billion — the amount lost (in free checking and imposition of new bank fees) that exceeded any gains from lower retail prices — according to a 2015 study published in the Oxford Review of Law & Economics. Smaller retailers are also losing out from the Durbin amendment. They often make purchases with debit cards and checking accounts, in addition to accepting them as forms of payments. So they have been losing their free checking, just as consumers have, and business debit card rewards. If the Durbin amendment’s price controls stay in effect, eventually everyone will lose out. Price controls are notorious for choking off innovation, which could otherwise make payment processing better and cheaper. Only so many costs can be transferred to consumers, and both the quantity and quality of services from financial institutions in debit card processing may suffer from lack of investment. The results for retailers could be lost sales and a dearth of technology to fight the ever-increasing hazard of security breaches. Shortages are an outcome of all price controls that act as price ceilings, as these do. As the great free-market economist Thomas Sowell writes in his book Basic Economics, price ceilings mean “less is supplied at a lower price than at a higher price — less both quantitatively and qualitatively.” As the House moves forward with the Financial Choice Act, now is the time for Republicans to remember first principles and fight these price controls, just like they fought ObamaCare price controls. As conservative pundit Erick Erickson wrote shortly after Dodd-Frank and the Durbin amendment were enacted, “Standing idly by is an endorsement of Obama administration price controls and Dick Durbin’s leadership. It is also an abdication of conservative principles and responsibility." John Berlau is a senior fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute.

The fired McDonald’s manager who successfully sued after she was told she’d have to take a humiliating demotion or lose her job had reason to smile. On Tuesday, Ontario’s highest court upheld a ruling by an Ottawa judge finding that the 67-year-old grandmother had been “set up to fail” and was constructively dismissed after more than 25 years working at McDonald’s restaurants in Ottawa and Newfoundland. The court of appeal also found no reason to alter the judge’s decision to order McDonald’s to pay Brake $104.499.33 — plus interest and costs — to make up for the lack of notice and damages she suffered as a result. That’s on top of the additional $120,000 the company that manages the restaurant has been ordered to pay to cover Brake’s legal costs. “I’m on top of the world,” said Brake Tuesday. “It means everything to me. I’m very, very happy that the courts took the time to listen to an individual who took a company like McDonald’s on, and we won.” Brake said she hopes the appeal court’s decision will finally end the legal saga that began in 2012 after she was told she’d have to take a demotion to first assistant or be fired. The demotion didn’t involve a reduced salary, but would require Brake to report to a much younger manager she herself had trained, along with a significant loss in benefits. The ultimatum came after Brake received her first negative performance review in November 2011 after a decade of positive assessments, court heard. Following that negative review, she was transferred from the restaurant she managed on Hazeldean Road to one of the worst performing McDonald’s in the country, located in the back corner of a Walmart store at the Kanata Centrum. The judge found Brake was then put on a disciplinary program and subjected to performance standards that were arbitrary and unfair. Brake testified she worked 12 hours a day, seven days a week for five months. Brake achieved what the court described as “outstanding” scores compared with McDonald’s own corporate standards in customer service and quality and cleanliness, but just narrowly missed a third goal. Brake was told she had failed the program and would have to take the demotion or leave. After leaving McDonald’s, she tried to find other management jobs, but got no offers. Attempts to set up a babysitting service and work as a cleaner also failed. Eventually she took a job with Tim Hortons, and later Home Depot as a cashier. Brake said she is looking forward to her former employer finally paying up. But Brake doesn’t have any intention of quitting her current job — she had to dip into her retirement savings to survive after she left McDonald’s. “I haven’t got anything yet,” said Brake. “Yes, it’s a lot of money but at the end of the day I have to watch every cent to keep on living.” The owners of the McDonald’s franchise could still try to appeal the case to the Supreme Court of Canada, but the test for cases is stringent. Only a small percentage of cases are ever heard by the country’s top court. A lawyer representing the McDonald’s franchise didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment Tuesday. “My gut tells me this is over,” said Brake’s lawyer, Miriam Vale Peters. “Five years later she’ll see her money. That’s the reality of Esther Brake.” Vale Peters said she never expected the case to drag on as long as it has. “This is a case that I never thought would go this far,” she said. “In my experience, 99 cases out of 100 settle. I’m surprised, and I continued to be surprised up until the day I was to be in court, that we were still there.” The court noted in an earlier decision that the judgments in the case could have been avoided if the McDonald’s offers to settle weren’t so “woefully inadequate.” Brake said people have come up to her in the Home Depot store where she works now and told her they were proud of her for taking McDonald’s to court. Brake said she feels vindicated by the decisions from the two courts. “The first thing I would tell anybody is, if they feel they are being treated unfairly — it’s a tough battle, I’m not saying it’s an easy battle — I tell them, ‘Go for it. Don’t hold back. Go for it.’ If you tell the truth, you could win.” aseymour@postmedia.com Twitter.com/andrew_seymour Videos Vermont's Governor Vetoes A Bill To Legalize Recreational Marijuana Guardian Reporter Says He Was 'Body Slammed' By GOP House Candidate 'Game Of Thrones' Trailer For Season 7, Martin Confirms 5 Spinoffs Trump Splits From His Cabinet On 'Madman' Kim Jong-Un's Mental Health Security Images Show Manchester Bomber CBO: Republican Health Care Bill Cuts Less Than Previous Versions Belgian PM welcomes Trudeau to Brussels ahead of NATO summit A Company's Plan To Fix Fisheries Has Scientists Feeling Skeptical Does Trump's Budget Cut Medicaid Funding?

MUST CREDIT: Washington Post photo by Sarah L. Voisin. Can this contraption really help you sleep on a plane? by Thomas Heath Washington Post 2 hrs ago 0 Sarah L. Voisin Ephi Zlotnitsky, an Israeli-born entrepreneur, tries out his new airplane pillow - dubbed JetComfy - at his Rockville, Md., office. MUST CREDIT: Washington Post photo by Sarah L. Voisin. Ephi Zlotnitsky landed in Washington as a 22-year-old immigrant from Israel on a July Saturday in 1989. The next day, the former Israel paratrooper, who barely spoke English, walked into a local kosher deli and got a job. As he recalls it: "The owner said, 'I don't have a job for you.' I said, 'I'm not leaving.' He asked me, what can I do?" "Whatever you want," Zlotnitsky replied. "Wash dishes. Clean floors." He did all that - and also made a mean Israeli salad. Fast forward 28 years. The peripatetic Zlotnitsky, now 50, has started several companies, including a real estate company and a Maryland-based software firm. But it's his foray into airline travel that got my attention. Zlotnitsky is not only an example of the rich contributions that immigrants bring to America. His is also a tale of the thankless frustrations that go with building a business. And what with all the horror stories about fights, riots, even scorpions, on the airlines recently, I thought Zlotnitsky's little project to bring peaceful sleep to airline travelers was timely. The entrepreneur has helped invent an airplane pillow with the kitschy name of JetComfy. JetComfy reminds me of those wacky late-night ads hawking offbeat contraptions like the Veg-O-Matic, Pocket Fisherman and Inside the Shell Egg Scrambler. Like entrepreneur and TV marketer Ron Popeil, Zlotnitsky is always thinking of the next thing. People like Zlotnitsky impress me. I wish I had 2 percent of his energy and resourcefulness. After talking with him for an hour, I called the businessman who recommended him to me and asked, 'Is this guy for real?' " He assured me he was. "I wasn't the brightest guy," said Zlotnitsky, who was born and raised 20 minutes north of Tel Aviv. "But I've always been this guy who was thinking outside the box. I don't believe in 'no.' " This anecdote is from when he was a teenager: "We were driving in a car at night in the middle of nowhere in Israel and a belt broke in our car. We couldn't see anything. "The driver looks at me and said, 'We are stuck here.' I said 'I am breaking the mirror.' I told him to turn on the headlights and shine from one mirror to another. We managed to fix the belt and drove back home. From that day, people came to me to fix stuff." His latest mission is fixing sleep problems for travelers. The airspace for plane pillows is as crowded as the skies. The horseshoe pillow has been around for decades. A former Virgin Atlantic flight attendant, a few years back, invented a J-shaped pillow. "Airlines are cramming you in and there is less space and less everything," he said. "At least you want to sleep normal." Zlotnitsky and a business partner have invested three years and $350,000 to create the JetComfy. The pillow is the size of a purse and sells for $39.99. About 10,000 units have been sold since it went on sale in January. Zlotnitsky said he has plans to open the first JetComfy comfort sales center in Dulles International Airport in August and hopes to expand to 25 locations at larger airports in a year. The pillow is available now on Amazon Prime and at Luggage Plus stores and will be offered online by Walmart later this month. It weighs less than a pound and measures 9.5-by-5.5 inches. It looks nothing like a pillow - more like a foam headrest attached to a foot-long pole supported by the arm of your seat. Zlotnitsky is betting that, among the more than 3 billion people who fly every year, there is enough of a market for him to sell millions of JetComfys. "We plan to sell over 350,000 units by mid-2018 in the U.S. alone," he said. "We are working to start distribution is Europe, China, Australia and the Middle East." After leaving the Israeli Defense Forces, Zlotnitsky started a plastering company. It failed, leaving him $250,000 in debt. "I didn't know what I was doing," he said. "I took loans. I bought machinery. All kinds of crazy stuff." He eventually paid off the bank loans. Zlotnitsky had better luck in the United States. He and his brother, Chanan, grew a small newspaper distribution route into the region's largest news delivery businesses, known as News One. They sold it to Hudson News in 2008, before print's steepest decline and in time to make some money off the sale. They invested in iControl. The $150 million company's technology aids communications between retailers and suppliers, and Zlotnitsky owns 22 percent of it. Goldman Sachs owns a chunk, too. In between, he has invested in real estate that earned enough money to subsidize iControl, JetComfy and a few other endeavors. "I don't know what I'm worth," he said. "I hope I'm worth a lot." JetComfy all started on a diving trip with his wife to Bora Bora in 2014. As they were exiting the Air Tahiti jet, he heard a passenger named David Brecht, a battery engineer from San Diego, call it the "worst flight ever." At the hotel bar later, the two decided to team up to bring restful sleep to those who can't afford to buy spacious first-class seats. Zlotnitsky's idea was to re-create the comfort of your chin resting in the cup of your hand with your elbow resting on the desk or table. "That's the natural position," he said. "You tell somebody to rest their head, and that's what they are going to do." They created mock-ups out of cardboard. They drew designs on toilet paper. They bought "selfie sticks" for the pillow stand. They Skyped between Maryland and San Diego. They bought a used 3-D printer for $2,300. They bought used airline seats on eBay to test their designs. They bought foam, aluminum, plastic. They pulled all-nighters. "Dave is the geek that can take my ideas and make it happen. I am the guy taking it to the business. We spent almost two years building this crazy thing." They tried out several names: EZ Rest (using Zlotnitsky's initials); EasyComfy. Their wives came up with JetComfy. The low point came on a factory-hunting trip to China in March 2016. Zlotnitsky arrived in Shenzhen, an industrial city of 12 million, in the middle of the night, meandering for three hours in a cab with a driver who did not understand English. " 'That's it,' I thought," Zlotnitsky said. "I'm not coming back from this one. It was like a movie." But he did come back after finding a small factory that could build most of the parts for his pillow. By last summer, they had nine test pillows that they asked friends and family to try. They sent samples to the Hallmark Channel and media outlets. They got a write-up on the HuffPost's website and a profile by a San Diego television station. Zlotnitsky sent me a free sample. My wife, Polly, took it with her on a trip overseas last week to serve as my guinea pig. "JetComfy is a plus," she reported back from Europe. "Not nirvana, but a definite improvement. It has earned a return ticket." × Post a comment as Emoticons [smile] [beam] [wink] [sad] [cool] [innocent] [rolleyes] [whistling] [lol] [huh] [tongue] [love] [sleeping] [yawn] [unsure] [angry] [blink] [crying] [ohmy] [scared] [sleep] [sneaky] [tongue_smile] [thumbdown] [thumbup] [censored] [happybirthday] [ban] [spam] [offtopic] [batman] [ninja] [pirate] [alien] Comment Text Cancel Post comment × Report Cancel Report Abuse × Watch this discussion.

Set for 4 p.m. June 3 at the Searcy Event Center, the festival’s vendors will include J & M Meat Market, Dickey’s BBQ, Slader’s Alaskan Dumpling Co., Kona Ice, Say Cheese Food Truck, Hot Rod Wieners and Ascenino’s Grill. Armentrout, the festival’s coordinator, said she’s excited about bringing an event like this to Searcy. “The festival will be sponsored by local businesses in the area,” Armentrout said. “We want to be sure that it is understood that this is not a city-of-Searcy-sponsored event, and no taxpayer dollars have been spent.” Employees from the Searcy Code Enforcement office and Searcy Parks and Recreation are spearheading the event, she said. “I’ve met many great people at work, and I kept telling them we need to have a food truck festival. People have told me they think we need to have one as well, so we finally asked the mayor if he’d allow us to,” she said. Sponsors include Think Idea Studio, Zion Climbing, Homer’s Ace Hardware, Yarnell’s Ice Cream, First Community Bank, RiverWind Bank, AJ’s Art Studio, Quattlebaum Music and First Security Bank, among others. “I love food trucks,” Armentrout said. “They’re cheap, quick, and I’d love to see more food trucks come to Searcy. “I’ve never spoken to anyone who said they didn’t like food trucks. I’m coordinating the event, but it’s because everyone I’ve spoken to has voiced how excited they are about food trucks coming to town.” Armentrout said she has been planning the festival since March and has skipped lunch breaks to spend time pulling the event together. “Food trucks are trending right now, and we really just wanted to bring something fun and different to Searcy,” she said. “I hope the event eventually becomes one of the biggest food truck festivals in the state.” Armentrout said money raised at the event will be donated to the Child Safety Center in Searcy, excluding money made by the food truck vendors. She said multiple people have volunteered to be dunked in the dunking booth, including White County Judge Michael Lincoln, White County Sheriff Ricky Shourd, Searcy Fire Department Assistant Fire Chief Andy Woody and Harding University’s head men’s basketball coach, Jeff Morgan. All proceeds from the dunking booth will go to the Child Safety Center. Armentrout said Yarnell’s will donate free ice cream sandwiches, Walmart will give away baked goods and have a face-painting booth, Chick-fil-A will have a food wheel to spin and balloons to give away, Homer’s Ace Hardware will give away popcorn, AJ’s Art Studio will have a painting class set up for children, and the Fire Department will be at the festival with its smoke house for children to go through. Sam’s Club and Adventure Kids Dental will also have booths at the festival, she said. Costumed characters will entertain children throughout the evening, including the Chick-fil-A cow, the Searcy Fire Department’s fire dog and the White County Sheriff’s Office’s Deputy Dan. “I have young children, so I want Searcy to be known for these types of festivals,” Armentrout said. “We’re not charging vendors to set up or charging admission. It’s all about growing Searcy into a place people want to visit and showing off our amazing local businesses. “Everyone seems to be excited. I haven’t heard any negative feedback about the event.” Brian Bostic, co-owner of the Say Cheese food truck, said he and his partner, Trent Moss, launched Say Cheese in March of this year. Moss said their business is based in Cabot, but they travel and participate in events. Bostic said they’re excited to be part of the Searcy Food Truck Festival, as friends and followers in Searcy have supported their business from the beginning. “When we got approached about being in the festival, we were glad to be a part of that town,” Bostic said. Say Cheese serves what Bostic calls “gourmet grilled-cheese” sandwiches. The “Say Cheese” sandwich has American and Swiss cheese on it, then it’s put on the griddle with Gruyere cheese that forms a crust on the outside of the bread, he said. The truck also offers a jalapeno popper sandwich, a roast-beef specialty sandwich and the Full Monte sandwich, inspired by Bennigan’s, among other items. Moss said his favorite sandwich is the Full Monte, made with turkey, ham, American cheese and Swiss cheese, deep-fried and topped with powdered sugar and raspberry jam. “We like being able to cook what we like to cook,” Bostic said. “We get to be creative in what we’re doing. If we’re having a slow day, we’ll experiment with new things to freshen up the menu.” Bostic said he and Moss like being at events and feeling the energy from all of the people who are there. “I’m more than excited about the food truck festival,” Moss said. “Business has just been taking off since we started doing this. I love to cook, and I love to put a smile on people’s faces when they eat my food. We have a lot of new sandwiches coming, we’re having fun, and we hope everyone can enjoy the food,” he said. “We like the idea of being able to move around and meet different people. We want to take our food to different places and let everybody try it,” Moss said. “It seems like the volunteers in Searcy are trying to reach out and do something for their community,” Bostic said, “and we like being a part of that.” Staff writer Kayla Baugh can be reached at (501) 244-4307 or kbaugh@arkansasonline.com.

Tornadoes cut a path of destruction across Iredell, Davie, Yadkin and Stokes counties Wednesday, leaving behind broken trees, a damaged school gym, and dozens of damaged or destroyed houses. A few injuries were reported but no fatalities, and people across the area were expressing thanks for that. Barry Williard, the chief of the Courtney Volunteer Fire Department in Yadkin County, said he and two other firefighters were inside their fire station about 4:30 p.m. on Courtney-Huntsville Road when they saw a tornado coming toward them, from the southwest. “At that time, we took cover in the fire department,” Williard said. “Whenever we looked out, we saw substantial damage across the road (at Courtney Elementary School). It was a pretty good size debris field.” At the school, a tornado struck the school’s gym, knocking down two walls and tearing off its roof, authorities said. Just before the tornado touched down, a group of about 25 people, including students and teachers, took cover inside the school adjacent to the gym, said Keith Vestal, the county emergency management director. No one at the school was injured. “They followed their tornado warning plan, and everything worked well,” Vestal said. The National Weather Service confirmed that tornadoes touched down in southeastern Yadkin County and southwestern Stokes County. The weather service received a report that a funnel cloud, possibly a tornado, touched down six miles northeast of Statesville in Iredell County. There was also an unconfirmed report of a tornado near Monroe in Union County. Three people were injured and 35 houses and other structures were damaged in the Four Corners Road area in northeastern Davie County, where local officials declared a state of emergency, according to Jerry Myers, the county’s emergency management coordinator. Two of the injured were wounded during the storm and one afterward when he cut himself using a chain saw to cut a tree, Myers said, adding that none of the injuries in Davie County was serious. A woman in a mobile home on Baity Road in southeastern Yadkin County was injured when the tornado touched down near Courtney Elementary School, her neighbors said. The woman suffered broken bones and was taken to Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center, the neighbors said. In Stokes County the storm cut a path from the southwest around Pinnacle toward Lawsonville to the northeast, plowing across Sauratown Mountain in the process and snapping off so many trees it looked like part of the mountain had been logged. The worst damage in Stokes County seemed concentrated in an area encompassing Marshall Smith Road, YMCA Camp Road and Cliff View Drive, where a number of mobile homes were damaged, said Stokes County Sheriff Mike Marshall. Those neighborhoods all sit at the foot of the south side of Sauratown Mountain. “So far, I have personally seen about 15 homes that have damage and I’m sure there are more,” Marshall said Wednesday night as he moved around the area checking for damage. “I’m making my way through, trying to get them shelter through emergency management.” On YMCA Camp Road there were three houses destroyed, including two modular homes, Marshall said. “There were several barns that were totally demolished,” he said. A giant oak tree sliced through the kitchen and dining area of a mobile home off Marshall Smith Road, but the renters, Will and Nancy Gambill, got out before the damage when they heard about the tornado warning. “They left and went to Walmart so nobody was at home, but it has got a lot of damage,” said Sandra Smith, the owner of the mobile home. Smith and her husband Stanley were at their house on Gentry Farm Road when the storm hit. “It didn’t hit our house but we have a streak of trees through the woods where it clipped them,” Sandra Smith said. Smith gathered together some relatives and took shelter in her own basement at the height of the storm. “There was a huge roaring noise in the fireplace,” she said. “I looked out and the trees were swaying real bad and it was dark, but we were fine in the basement.” Vickie and Bobby Boyles were in the den of their home on Marshall Smith Road when the storm hit. “The power kept blinking,” Vickie Boyles said. “And the next thing that happened was a racket. We looked at each other and both of us said, ‘What happened?’ We opened the door and there was so much mud on the storm door we couldn’t see out. And he opened the door and everything was gone.” The storm blew away the Boyles’ carport and left it scattered across the yard on the other side of the house. It blew the roof off the den where the couple had been during the storm. A mailbox and the electrical attachment to the house were both ripped away. The whole front of their house was spackled with little bits of insulation. “There’s lots and lots of trees down,” said Maj. Jeff Lemons, Stokes County Sheriff’s Office, who manned traffic control at an intersection on Marshall Smith Road. “I know of several areas where there are trees on houses and on porches. There’s been some barn roofs and outbuilding roofs blown off. I’ve seen a couple of hay barns and outbuildings blown off of their foundations.” Lemons said he was on the other side of Sauratown Mountain when the storm came across and that it “looked like the mountain split the storm.” Damage extended toward Lawsonville on the north side of the mountain, but authorities said it was not as bad there. As the storm made its way into Stokes County it downed trees onto U.S. 52, blocking the southbound lanes until the trees could be cleared away. Yadkin County first responders helped people in 10 damaged houses on Baity Road get out of their homes. The affected residents are staying with their relatives in Yadkin County, authorities said. The American Red Cross was also helping. Courtney Elementary will be closed today because of damage from the tornado. Stokes County schools are on a two-hour delay today, with the start of end-of-grade testing postponed to Friday, school officials said. Duke Energy said about 1,100 customers in Northwest North Carolina were without power about 10:30 p.m. Wednesday. wyoung@wsjournal.com 336-727-7369 @jhintonWSJ Homes destroyed by possible tornado in eastern Iredell At least two homes were destroyed by a possible tornado off Highway 64 in eastern Iredell County near the Davie County line.

Some of them voiced these worries at a recent planning commission meeting with the city. David Brooks is one of those residents. He said when he was younger, his family owned the land that Andi Pratt and her husband are wanting to build on. Brooks said his concerns are not with the Pratts, but with how their project could affect the neighborhood. He said he is worried about traffic, noise and the local environment. Some of the plans the Pratts have are making their business a spot for weddings or small gatherings. “There was quite a bit of opposition we weren’t necessarily thinking it would be," Pratt said. "We are so open to hearing their concerns and adjusting our plan because we are early in the process.” She continued to say that they plan to have a meeting with many of their neighbors to further discuss these worries. They said they want to do this before the next planning commission meeting, so they can make a new proposal to the city. Pratt said their land is already zoned for what they want to do. They are just trying to get some conditional use permits approved at this stage in their plans. Brooks said he does not want to see any commercial ventures past the Lowes and Walmart not too far from his home. “Don’t infringe anymore than what’s already up here," Brooks said. "There’s generations of families that’s been up here. I’ve been here since ’63 and we just want to remain nice and quiet and peaceful and enjoy our neighbors and our surroundings.” Pratt said they are up for making changes to their plans to make sure everyone on Finger Road is happy with what they are doing. "We absolutely would love to hear those concerns so we can take action before it’s to far down the line for us to make a change," Pratt said. Pratt said they want to work with nature, which means keeping as many of the trees in the area as they can. Once everything is approved by the city, Pratt said they hoped to open for business around mid 2018.   Filed in: News Suggest a correction × Suggest A Correction Your name Your email Report a typo or grammatical error Cancel Share this: Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest LinkedIn Email Leave a Reply Cancel reply Enter your comment here...

Buy Now Andrew Dye/Journal Andrew Dye/Journal Emergency workers survey damage on Courtney-Huntsville Road after a tornado moved through the area. Tornadoes cut a path of destruction across Iredell, Davie, Yadkin and Stokes counties Wednesday, leaving behind broken trees, a damaged school gym, and dozens of damaged or destroyed houses. A few injuries were reported but no fatalities, and people across the area were expressing thanks for that. Barry Williard, the chief of the Courtney Volunteer Fire Department in Yadkin County, said he and two other firefighters were inside their fire station about 4:30 p.m. on Courtney-Huntsville Road when they saw a tornado coming toward them, from the southwest. “At that time, we took cover in the fire department,” Williard said. “Whenever we looked out, we saw substantial damage across the road (at Courtney Elementary School). It was a pretty good size debris field.” At the school, a tornado struck the school’s gym, knocking down two walls and tearing off its roof, authorities said. Just before the tornado touched down, a group of about 25 people, including students and teachers, took cover inside the school adjacent to the gym, said Keith Vestal, the county emergency management director. No one at the school was injured. “They followed their tornado warning plan, and everything worked well,” Vestal said. The National Weather Service confirmed that tornadoes touched down in southeastern Yadkin County and southwestern Stokes County. The weather service received a report that a funnel cloud, possibly a tornado, touched down six miles northeast of Statesville in Iredell County. There was also an unconfirmed report of a tornado near Monroe in Union County. Three people were injured and 35 houses and other structures were damaged in the Four Corners Road area in northeastern Davie County, where local officials declared a state of emergency, according to Jerry Myers, the county’s emergency management coordinator. Two of the injured were wounded during the storm and one afterward when he cut himself using a chain saw to cut a tree, Myers said, adding that none of the injuries in Davie County was serious. A woman in a mobile home on Baity Road in southeastern Yadkin County was injured when the tornado touched down near Courtney Elementary School, her neighbors said. The woman suffered broken bones and was taken to Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center, the neighbors said. In Stokes County the storm cut a path from the southwest around Pinnacle toward Lawsonville to the northeast, plowing across Sauratown Mountain in the process and snapping off so many trees it looked like part of the mountain had been logged. The worst damage in Stokes County seemed concentrated in an area encompassing Marshall Smith Road, YMCA Camp Road and Cliff View Drive, where a number of mobile homes were damaged, said Stokes County Sheriff Mike Marshall. Those neighborhoods all sit at the foot of the south side of Sauratown Mountain. “So far, I have personally seen about 15 homes that have damage and I’m sure there are more,” Marshall said Wednesday night as he moved around the area checking for damage. “I’m making my way through, trying to get them shelter through emergency management.” On YMCA Camp Road there were three houses destroyed, including two modular homes, Marshall said. “There were several barns that were totally demolished,” he said. A giant oak tree sliced through the kitchen and dining area of a mobile home off Marshall Smith Road, but the renters, Will and Nancy Gambill, got out before the damage when they heard about the tornado warning. “They left and went to Walmart so nobody was at home, but it has got a lot of damage,” said Sandra Smith, the owner of the mobile home. Smith and her husband Stanley were at their house on Gentry Farm Road when the storm hit. “It didn’t hit our house but we have a streak of trees through the woods where it clipped them,” Sandra Smith said. Smith gathered together some relatives and took shelter in her own basement at the height of the storm. “There was a huge roaring noise in the fireplace,” she said. “I looked out and the trees were swaying real bad and it was dark, but we were fine in the basement.” Vickie and Bobby Boyles were in the den of their home on Marshall Smith Road when the storm hit. “The power kept blinking,” Vickie Boyles said. “And the next thing that happened was a racket. We looked at each other and both of us said, ‘What happened?’ We opened the door and there was so much mud on the storm door we couldn’t see out. And he opened the door and everything was gone.” The storm blew away the Boyles’ carport and left it scattered across the yard on the other side of the house. It blew the roof off the den where the couple had been during the storm. A mailbox and the electrical attachment to the house were both ripped away. The whole front of their house was spackled with little bits of insulation. “There’s lots and lots of trees down,” said Maj. Jeff Lemons, Stokes County Sheriff’s Office, who manned traffic control at an intersection on Marshall Smith Road. “I know of several areas where there are trees on houses and on porches. There’s been some barn roofs and outbuilding roofs blown off. I’ve seen a couple of hay barns and outbuildings blown off of their foundations.” Lemons said he was on the other side of Sauratown Mountain when the storm came across and that it “looked like the mountain split the storm.” Damage extended toward Lawsonville on the north side of the mountain, but authorities said it was not as bad there. As the storm made its way into Stokes County it downed trees onto U.S. 52, blocking the southbound lanes until the trees could be cleared away. Yadkin County first responders helped people in 10 damaged houses on Baity Road get out of their homes. The affected residents are staying with their relatives in Yadkin County, authorities said. The American Red Cross was also helping. Courtney Elementary will be closed today because of damage from the tornado. Stokes County schools are on a two-hour delay today, with the start of end-of-grade testing postponed to Friday, school officials said. Duke Energy said about 1,100 customers in Northwest North Carolina were without power about 10:30 p.m. Wednesday. wyoung@wsjournal.com 336-727-7369 @jhintonWSJ Homes destroyed by possible tornado in eastern Iredell At least two homes were destroyed by a possible tornado off Highway 64 in eastern Iredell County near the Davie County line.

On Tuesday (May 23), a woman walked into Belle Starr Antique Mall and switched the price tag on a bird cage stand, causing the store to lose more than $50 on just one item. "She was in and out in rapid time," owner Beth Templeton said. "I believe she had probably come in prior to purchase, took a picture of the particular items' tag. When I was able to compare the tags directly next to each other, it was clear." Now Belle Starr and other local shops are upping security with multiple surveillance cameras and a locker system. With the locker system, customers must leave their purses and bags at the front of the store in a locker while shopping. "These are just measures that we have had to take to help protect our vendors' inventory, so little things don't slip out," Templeton said. The thief caught on surveillance video on Tuesday brought in a price tag that was forged to look just like the ones you find in the store. Now, the owner is encouraging her vendors to use price tags that are harder to duplicate. "A few different ways that we can try to be more preventative [are] each vendor can make their own tags or do something specific and distinguishing that can't be replicated as easy," Templeton said. "This is definitely helping to keep us at that next level of our security to protect our vendors." For these stores, this type of tag switches is affecting more than just the shop's owners. "It is never okay, regardless of if you are shopping at Walmart or at Belle Starr," Templeton said. "But, when you're shopping small, you're shopping local and you take something from a business like ours, you are literally taking it directly from an individual." "It doesn't feel good at all," Linda Elsken, vendor at Remember When Antique Mall said. "We're on the road a lot, you have to go further and further to find things. You bring them home and clean it, sometimes you have to repair it. It's not a good feeling." The Facebook post of the tag swapping woman is gaining attention on social media, putting the owner one step closer to identifying the thief. For now, vendors and shop owners have this message for thieves: "Be careful when you come to our antique malls," Elsken said. "We're watching you."

If you have any information about the woman who swapped the price tags, please contact Belle Starr Antique Mall or the River Valley Crime Stoppers at 78-CRIME.

Tornadoes cut a path of destruction across Iredell, Davie, Yadkin and Stokes counties Wednesday, leaving behind broken trees, a damaged school gym, and dozens of damaged or destroyed houses. A few injuries were reported but no fatalities, and people across the area were expressing thanks for that. Barry Williard, the chief of the Courtney Volunteer Fire Department in Yadkin County, said he and two other firefighters were inside their fire station about 4:30 p.m. on Courtney-Huntsville Road when they saw a tornado coming toward them, from the southwest. “At that time, we took cover in the fire department,” Williard said. “Whenever we looked out, we saw substantial damage across the road (at Courtney Elementary School). It was a pretty good size debris field.” At the school, a tornado struck the school’s gym, knocking down two walls and tearing off its roof, authorities said. Just before the tornado touched down, a group of about 25 people, including students and teachers, took cover inside the school adjacent to the gym, said Keith Vestal, the county emergency management director. No one at the school was injured. “They followed their tornado warning plan, and everything worked well,” Vestal said. The National Weather Service confirmed that tornadoes touched down in southeastern Yadkin County and southwestern Stokes County. The weather service received a report that a funnel cloud, possibly a tornado, touched down six miles northeast of Statesville in Iredell County. There was also an unconfirmed report of a tornado near Monroe in Union County. Three people were injured and 35 houses and other structures were damaged in the Four Corners Road area in northeastern Davie County, where local officials declared a state of emergency, according to Jerry Myers, the county’s emergency management coordinator. Two of the injured were wounded during the storm and one afterward when he cut himself using a chain saw to cut a tree, Myers said, adding that none of the injuries in Davie County was serious. A woman in a mobile home on Baity Road in southeastern Yadkin County was injured when the tornado touched down near Courtney Elementary School, her neighbors said. The woman suffered broken bones and was taken to Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center, the neighbors said. In Stokes County the storm cut a path from the southwest around Pinnacle toward Lawsonville to the northeast, plowing across Sauratown Mountain in the process and snapping off so many trees it looked like part of the mountain had been logged. The worst damage in Stokes County seemed concentrated in an area encompassing Marshall Smith Road, YMCA Camp Road and Cliff View Drive, where a number of mobile homes were damaged, said Stokes County Sheriff Mike Marshall. Those neighborhoods all sit at the foot of the south side of Sauratown Mountain. “So far, I have personally seen about 15 homes that have damage and I’m sure there are more,” Marshall said Wednesday night as he moved around the area checking for damage. “I’m making my way through, trying to get them shelter through emergency management.” On YMCA Camp Road there were three houses destroyed, including two modular homes, Marshall said. “There were several barns that were totally demolished,” he said. A giant oak tree sliced through the kitchen and dining area of a mobile home off Marshall Smith Road, but the renters, Will and Nancy Gambill, got out before the damage when they heard about the tornado warning. “They left and went to Walmart so nobody was at home, but it has got a lot of damage,” said Sandra Smith, the owner of the mobile home. Smith and her husband Stanley were at their house on Gentry Farm Road when the storm hit. “It didn’t hit our house but we have a streak of trees through the woods where it clipped them,” Sandra Smith said. Smith gathered together some relatives and took shelter in her own basement at the height of the storm. “There was a huge roaring noise in the fireplace,” she said. “I looked out and the trees were swaying real bad and it was dark, but we were fine in the basement.” Vickie and Bobby Boyles were in the den of their home on Marshall Smith Road when the storm hit. “The power kept blinking,” Vickie Boyles said. “And the next thing that happened was a racket. We looked at each other and both of us said, ‘What happened?’ We opened the door and there was so much mud on the storm door we couldn’t see out. And he opened the door and everything was gone.” The storm blew away the Boyles’ carport and left it scattered across the yard on the other side of the house. It blew the roof off the den where the couple had been during the storm. A mailbox and the electrical attachment to the house were both ripped away. The whole front of their house was spackled with little bits of insulation. “There’s lots and lots of trees down,” said Maj. Jeff Lemons, Stokes County Sheriff’s Office, who manned traffic control at an intersection on Marshall Smith Road. “I know of several areas where there are trees on houses and on porches. There’s been some barn roofs and outbuilding roofs blown off. I’ve seen a couple of hay barns and outbuildings blown off of their foundations.” Lemons said he was on the other side of Sauratown Mountain when the storm came across and that it “looked like the mountain split the storm.” Damage extended toward Lawsonville on the north side of the mountain, but authorities said it was not as bad there. As the storm made its way into Stokes County it downed trees onto U.S. 52, blocking the southbound lanes until the trees could be cleared away. Yadkin County first responders helped people in 10 damaged houses on Baity Road get out of their homes. The affected residents are staying with their relatives in Yadkin County, authorities said. The American Red Cross was also helping. Courtney Elementary will be closed today because of damage from the tornado. Stokes County schools are on a two-hour delay today, with the start of end-of-grade testing postponed to Friday, school officials said. Duke Energy said about 1,100 customers in Northwest North Carolina were without power about 10:30 p.m. Wednesday. wyoung@wsjournal.com 336-727-7369 @jhintonWSJ Homes destroyed by possible tornado in eastern Iredell At least two homes were destroyed by a possible tornado off Highway 64 in eastern Iredell County near the Davie County line.

Rick Scott on Wednesday vetoed the hotly-debated "liquor wall" bill that would have repealed a Prohibition-era law that prevents grocery stores from selling hard liquor. The governor offered a hint of his thinking a day earlier when, in response to a reporter's question, he said one factor would be the past struggles with alcoholism among members of his family. But he said the decision came down to his signature issue -- jobs. RELATED NEWS/ARCHIVE If Rick Scott vetoes public school budget, here's what happens 2 Days Ago Supporters of state parks tell Rick Scott: 'Veto this bad budget' 1 Day Ago Will Rick Scott sign or veto 'liquor wall' bill? Two big clues here 1 Day Ago "I have heard concerns as to how this bill could affect many small businesses across Florida," Scott wrote in a veto message. "I was a small business owner and many locally owned businesses have told me how this bill will affect their families and their ability to create jobs." The bill's supporters included big-box retailers such as Walmart, Target, Costco, Sam's Club and Walgreens, all of which stood to profit handsomely by the destruction of the wall. The opponents included locally-owned liquor stores, the statewide ABC Fine Wine & Spirits chain, and Lakeland-based Publix, which has invested millions in stand-alone liquor stores walled off from, but close to, its supermarkets. At least 28 other states allow grocery stores to sell spirits along with beer and wine. The bill (SB 106) was one of the most heavily-lobbied bills of the session and passed both chambers by very narrow margins, a reflection of the powerful moneyed interests lined up on both sides. The Senate vote was 21-17 and the House vote was 58-57. After the House vote, one lawmaker switched his vote from yes to no. In addition, at least three House members did not vote on the bill and were accused of "taking a walk" to avoid casting a diffcult vote.

First, employees noticed the man stuffing a can of beer down his pants in an attempt to steal it (or just cool his junk off), but he wasn't ready to make for the exit just yet. The man pulled another can from the cooler and approached the counter to pay for it, perhaps to throw off the scent of shoplifter he had already given off. The only problem, he wasn't going about this purchase honestly, either. The man attempted to buy the second beer with counterfeit money, but ran from the store when confronted. Mightier Than the Sword Too much homework can make you want to stab someone, which is what makes an incident that occurred at Reid Park Academy last week all the more dangerous. A school resource officer said someone at the school told him about a student with a pen that was also a knife. Sure enough, when the officer investigated, he found the student to be in possession of a pen from which you could remove the back and it would become a small knife. The perfect tool for those more intense essay contests. Take Your Pick An officer approached a vehicle at a stop light on Park Road last week at around 2 a.m. after he noticed the man wasn't bothering to go when the light turned green. Of course, the officer found that the man had dozed off behind the wheel, and woke him up for a pop quiz, also known as a field sobriety test. The man showed signs of impairment, and was arrested for DWI due to drug impairment. While searching the suspect, officers found naltrexone, a drug meant to fight off the effects of opiates or decrease the desire to take such drugs, but alongside that were six different pipes made for smoking a bevy of different drugs. So there's no telling what it was that sent the man into an unplanned early morning nap. Can I Crash Here? An underage drunk driver was also found to be inebriated last week after crashing his car in east Charlotte. Officers responded to a call involving the suspect, who had been involved in an accident at 7:30 a.m. in which he struck a house. Officers administered sobriety tests to the driver, which should have just been a quick one question test: Did you just drive into a fucking home? Undocumented Hopefully, a 25-year-old American man was not making any plans to leave the country, as a recent vehicle break-in left him stuck here under Trump with the rest of us, at least for the foreseeable future. The man filed a police report last week after his car was broken into in his University condominium's parking lot overnight. The man told police that the thief stole nothing but his birth certificate and passport, and is probably now fleeing to the border to start a new life as a lucky American ex-pat. People of Walmart An aggressive duo of shoplifters struck at a Walmart on Albemarle Road last week, and took down an older woman in order to make off with their non-impressive booty. According to a 64-year-old employee of the store, a man was approaching the exit with a set of bathroom chimes that he hadn't paid for. When she asked him to please stop, another man came at her and knocked her to the ground before both made a run for it together. Police then probably checked the vicinity for any tell-tall ringing sounds. People of Target While it's a relatively normal occurrence for nicotine addiction to take hold of someone to the point where they throw a brick through a convenience store window and make off with boxes of cigarettes, one thief at the Metropolitan was at least trying to make better decisions last week. According to Target employees at the location, a man came in and grabbed several boxes of Nicorette gum before fleeing the store and hopping into a getaway vehicle. We wish you all the luck in breaking your habit, sir. Sportsmanship Police recently responded to a youth football game at Martin Luther King, Jr. Middle School after the game broke out into a melee involving both kids and parents. A 35-year-old woman filed a report stating that two juvenile suspects pushed down her 6-year-old son during the game and began kicking him in the head. When she tried to come to her son's defense, a parent of one of those boys pushed her and then pulled her to the ground. Tweet Pin It Submit to Reddit Email Favorite Saving… Share Speaking of...

Your Facebook feed, never mind the newspapers, is still filled with foreign bombings, murky hints of Russian interference and reactionary analysis of the president's tweets. Just under the surface of mainstream discourse, alt-right groups continue to exacerbate tensions, engaging in public fist fights with anti-fascists and trolling the Internet with hate speech. As an engaged citizen, you've attended local resistance efforts, marching in support of science and open borders. Such demonstrations have been happening with at least monthly regularity, so it's no surprise you've begun hearing rumblings about plans for a far-right counter-demonstration in Missoula. You're skeptical—the neo-Nazis who announced their protest of a Jewish real estate agent in Whitefish turned out to be a false alarm, after all. As the scheduled day approaches, the group amps up its rhetoric. They start talking about carrying firearms openly, about showing Missoula what the alt-right is really made of. You try to brush off the implied threat, but it becomes harder and harder to unknot your stomach. The day finally arrives. The whole city is anxious. This time, they actually show up. Crowds of MAGA-hat-wearing young men (and a few women) swarm downtown. Some are sieg heiling, others hoist signs featuring Nazi symbology. Many of them are carrying: pistols, shotguns, semi-automatic rifles. In assembling, armed, they are exercising their rights—open carry and public protest are perfectly legal in Montana. And yet their presence feels clearly like a threat. The police are aware, of course—the demonstrators received the proper permits—but shy of actual violence there's nothing the cops can do. click to enlarge cover illustration by Charlie Wybierala Counter-protesters soon show up and line the streets. Paleoconservatives and neo-Nazis hurl insults at the spectrum of anti-Trump Missoulians. Resisters hurl insults back. Then a shot rings out. Maybe someone fired into the sky as a warning. Maybe the shot was fired into a crowd, or at some protester in particular. Regardless, the street is suddenly thrown into chaos. Whatever intangible barrier separated the two sides collapses, and within minutes downtown is engulfed in violence. Rocks and punches are thrown, and guns are drawn. But just one side has the guns. Soon, the police will swoop in with their full arsenal of military-grade response gear and quell the riot, but the police can't be everywhere. Now let's say you're at this demonstration. Let's say you're black, or Jewish, or transgender, or Native American, or Latinx, or liberal, or poor. You're unarmed, and your belief that something like this could never happen here has just been shattered. Empowered by the violence, a 20-year-old kid storms toward you with a 9mm pistol on his hip. Do you run? Alternately, let's say that the inauguration of Donald Trump on Jan. 20, 2017, shook you to your core. You couldn't get past the fear, born of the candidate's campaign rally thuggery and the embrace of white supremacists, that the country had taken a turn toward the threatening. So let's say that, in response, you went to a pawn shop, or a sporting goods store or Walmart, and you put $500 on the counter and left with a gun. You took some classes and got a concealed carry permit. You know how to use it. And let's say, in downtown Missoula, mid-riot, with an armed kid charging you, you have your gun with you. What would you do? Throughout history, both the political left and the political right have found occasion to take up arms, from the FARC in Colombia to the Bundys in Oregon. But in America, mainstream gun culture tends to favor conservatism. The Pew Research Center reported in 2014 that 41 percent of gun owners in the United States identify as conservative, with only 23 percent considering themselves liberal. The National Rifle Association gave 99 percent of the roughly $1.1 million it spent on campaign contributions in 2016 to Republicans, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. click to enlarge photo by Amy Donovan Gus Hemphill, 23, in his apartment. Hemphill studies the development of far-right movements at the University of Montana. Far-right individuals and groups make up just a fraction of conservatives, but Montana is no stranger to their influence. The Southern Poverty Law Center reported in February that of the 917 hate groups currently active in the United States, seven are based in Montana. Five of those groups are considered anti-Muslim, and two are primarily white nationalist. (Whitefish is the occasional stomping ground of Richard Spencer and his white nationalist National Policy Institute.) Such extremism has a long history, but SPLC claims that its prominence and visibility has increased dramatically following the election of Donald Trump. That election, and the newfound prominence and visibility of right-wing extremism, has leftists—Marxists, anarchists, socialists and some Democrats—reaching for their holsters. After the election last year, NBC reported that minority groups fearful of an uptick in hate crimes were arming themselves in response. And the BBC reported that FBI background checks for gun sales on last year's Black Friday, just weeks after Election Day, set a new single-day record. Today, the threat of far-right violence is palpable for many Montanans. In an age when neo-Nazis threaten to storm Whitefish and white supremacist propaganda litters Missoula synagogues and gas pumps, opponents and potential targets of newly empowered racists, nationalists and fascists have reason to be scared, and motive to recalibrate their response. Nick Campbell, a 27-year-old independent construction contractor and musician in Missoula, started learning to shoot from his parents when he was 5 years old. Today he's the very picture of a working-class anarchist, wearing jeans and a T-shirt revealing a tattoo of a black cat on his triceps, a symbol of the anarcho-syndicalist union the International Workers of the World.

Subscribe to feed Share on Facebook Share on Twitter ShareEmail  Print Americans celebrated Earth Day a few weeks back, amid great fanfare and wholesome platitudes. Schoolchildren sang paeans to mountains and snails. We were model citizens, picking up piles of trash. There was even a “Council of All Beings” ceremony for earthworms to voice their pain over being called “slimy.” These are all pressing issues, but the Independence Institute felt something was missing. Where was gratitude for that unsung portion of the earth, her fossil fuels? A constitutional and conservative think tank, the Institute decided an art contest was the best way to voice their gratitude. Thus, the Earth Day Fossil Fuels Art Contest came into being. Winners Sarah Bouma and Valerie Savarie – Earth Day Fossil Fuels Art Contest Spokesman Tracy K. Smith told WND their art contest may be limited in scope and lighthearted, but their purpose was serious – to highlight hypocrisy. “While most Earth Day participants decry the use of fossil fuels,” almost all are plugged in, charged up and amplified. “From the coal that produces electricity for the electric vehicles that bring participants to the events, to the spandex pants the participants wear, fossil fuels make Earth Day events possible,” she said. Planners deliberately baited leftists and nature worshippers, using terms they knew would bring reaction, such as showcasing “the awesomeness of fossil fuels.” The bait worked, and leftists raged – on their plastic computers, connected by fiber optics and satellites. “Little did we know that our art contest would attract national attention,” said Smith, listing just some of the outraged leftists: Comedy Central Show The Young Turks Think Progress Smith said the April 27 event received entries in several mediums, including poetry, song lyrics and photographs. First place winner was Sarah Bouma with “Fueling the American Dream.” It was a multimedia piece lauding the joys and possibilities of petroleum. She attributed fossil fuels for life saving medical advances, and predicted our “American Dream will soar like a fossil-fueled airplane!” Bouma’s artist’s statement also listed almost every medium and tool she used: “I’d like to thank PETROLEUM for providing the following materials used to create this piece: Gas Can (plastic); Markers (plastic); Hot glue and glue gun (plastic); Foam reinforcements [likely from coal or petroleum]; scissors handle (plastic); Cutting mat and hacksaw handle; Band-aids (no comment).” Sarah Bouma, 1st place winner of Earth Day Fossil Fuels art contest Valerie Savarie, 2nd place winner of Independence Institute’s Earth Day Fossil Fuels art contest Valerie Savarie picked up second place with her intriguing and snug sculpture “Obsolete.” Using a vintage book on engines, her 3-D assemblage used photos, an old vacuum tube, wires and other past technology. It was a homage to technological evolution, brought about by petroleum and plastics. Savarie questioned why coal, oil and gas are considered obsolete: “Coal fuels our factories, gas fuels our transportation, transportation fuels our ability to get goods and fuels our economy,” she wrote. “Fossil fuels – literally from the ground up – provide us the ability to live not as hunter gatherers but as inventors and thinkers.” Contest critics are among those claiming to live “as hunter-gatherers,” but do nothing even close. Their comments are amusing, especially this email exchange between Independence Institute President Jon Caldara and an indignant Mother Earther (let’s call him “LS”): Response from Independent Institute to Angry Person LS: How do you live with yourselves, when you support climate denying organizations that will cause thousands of deaths in the short term and untold destruction in the long term? JC: Well, Andy, it’s very difficult. But my gas-heated home and my well-chilled beer helps take the sting out of my remorse. LS: Do you care about anything other than money? JC: Absolutely. Sex. LS: How are you going to use money after you die sooner than you would otherwise as a result of destroying Earth’s environment? Lining your coffins doesn’t count. JC: Oh, Andy, after I die I’m leaving all my money to the angry feminists to use in their fight to get their sense of humor back from the environmentalists. LS: Do you think a bunch of energy industry lobbyists know more than 97.5 percent of all climate scientists? JC: Know more about what? Making money from government research grants? Definitely not. LS: Do you think calling people who would prefer to live and for there to still be a habitable (sic) planet after they die “enviros” is a slick burn? JC: Slick? Oh, no, not at all. We’re just happy when anything burns. LS. How much did the devil pay for your souls? JC: Actually, I sold them to the Koch brothers first, who then marked them up considerably and sold them to the devil. Hence my TV show, “Devil’s Advocate” with Jon Caldara. Clearly, Angry Person wasn’t interested in the art, but contended that art with such messages should not exist, or be supported. Leftist site Think Progress had nothing to say about potential art, but smeared the Independence Institute with an utter lack of creativity. Using hackneyed scare tactics, they noted the Institute was funded by “dark money groups” with a repeated refrain of “far right-wing.” Koch Brothers were mentioned several times, although their contribution was the smallest of the donors they listed (fishing back to 2001). Think Progress would never allow their funds to mingle with such filthy lucre. They use entirely green money – millions come from Walmart and George Soros. Their sole purpose of existence (according to their own site) is to “push back” against its conservative targets. This is far from the first petro-sponsored or themed art contest, but it may have the most attitude. In 2015, the George Bush Presidential Library and Museum called for children K-12 to create “original art reflecting energy use: past, present or future.” Winners received gift cards from Hobby Lobby (engaged in its own war with Liberaldom at the time). Chevron hosts joint ventures in Africa with the Ministry of Education. It’s an annual arts competition for children, driven by “pertinent themes in line with current social issues.” This year’s subject was “Waste to Wealth.” Shell Oil sponsors art contests across the Philippines for secondary students, bringing in some truly extraordinary art. Prizes help them with school funds or sponsorship. In 2012, Leomar C. Conejos won first place in Shell’s contest with his painting, “Child Trafficking.” “Child Trafficking” by Leomar C. Conejos. winner of 2012 Shell Oil art contest in Philippines Petro-giant Texaco has hosted art contests for children for at least 63 years, with seven different themes annually for differing grade levels, such as portraits or watercolors. It’s quite impressive, really. Although the petro-industry has its faults, holding art contests is a benign, if not gracious, activity. None of these seek political commentary, or promote the industry. How will Think Progress twist this into a scandal? Will it accuse them of a vast right-wing conspiracy to sell more (oil-based) Crayolas? Click here for reuse options!

Cox, Katie Show Caption Hide Caption Previous Next BEECH GROVE, Ind. – A series of food deserts could spring up around Indy if Marsh supermarkets close, and communities like Beech Grove may see themselves in similar situations. Beech Grove Mayor Dennis Buckley said the closing of the city’s supermarket could cause major problems. Marsh filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in mid-May and the chain plans to close its remaining 44 stores unless it finds a buyer. “That would be considered a food desert, there's nowhere to go to get food, they're going to have to rely on transportation,” said Buckley. “Most of these people live in the general area of the store, that causes a problem.” PREVIOUS | Marsh Supermarkets could close all locations if no buyer is found | Marsh to close longtime Indianapolis store at the end of January | Marsh is closing another Indianapolis store at the end of February | Marsh to close two more Indy stores by mid-April; that makes four in 2017 | Greenfield, Indy Marsh stores closing in May The next closest store similar to Marsh on Albany Street is Walmart – about 2 miles away.

Tornadoes cut a path of destruction across Iredell, Davie, Yadkin and Stokes counties Wednesday, leaving behind broken trees, a damaged school gym, and dozens of damaged or destroyed houses. A few injuries were reported but no fatalities, and people across the area were expressing thanks for that. Barry Williard, the chief of the Courtney Volunteer Fire Department in Yadkin County, said he and two other firefighters were inside their fire station about 4:30 p.m. on Courtney-Huntsville Road when they saw a tornado coming toward them, from the southwest. “At that time, we took cover in the fire department,” Williard said. “Whenever we looked out, we saw substantial damage across the road (at Courtney Elementary School). It was a pretty good size debris field.” At the school, a tornado struck the school’s gym, knocking down two walls and tearing off its roof, authorities said. Just before the tornado touched down, a group of about 25 people, including students and teachers, took cover inside the school adjacent to the gym, said Keith Vestal, the county emergency management director. No one at the school was injured. “They followed their tornado warning plan, and everything worked well,” Vestal said. The National Weather Service confirmed that tornadoes touched down in southeastern Yadkin County and southwestern Stokes County. The weather service received a report that a funnel cloud, possibly a tornado, touched down six miles northeast of Statesville in Iredell County. There was also an unconfirmed report of a tornado near Monroe in Union County. Three people were injured and 35 houses and other structures were damaged in the Four Corners Road area in northeastern Davie County, where local officials declared a state of emergency, according to Jerry Myers, the county’s emergency management coordinator. Two of the injured were wounded during the storm and one afterward when he cut himself using a chain saw to cut a tree, Myers said, adding that none of the injuries in Davie County was serious. A woman in a mobile home on Baity Road in southeastern Yadkin County was injured when the tornado touched down near Courtney Elementary School, her neighbors said. The woman suffered broken bones and was taken to Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center, the neighbors said. In Stokes County the storm cut a path from the southwest around Pinnacle toward Lawsonville to the northeast, plowing across Sauratown Mountain in the process and snapping off so many trees it looked like part of the mountain had been logged. The worst damage in Stokes County seemed concentrated in an area encompassing Marshall Smith Road, YMCA Camp Road and Cliff View Drive, where a number of mobile homes were damaged, said Stokes County Sheriff Mike Marshall. Those neighborhoods all sit at the foot of the south side of Sauratown Mountain. “So far, I have personally seen about 15 homes that have damage and I’m sure there are more,” Marshall said Wednesday night as he moved around the area checking for damage. “I’m making my way through, trying to get them shelter through emergency management.” On YMCA Camp Road there were three houses destroyed, including two modular homes, Marshall said. “There were several barns that were totally demolished,” he said. A giant oak tree sliced through the kitchen and dining area of a mobile home off Marshall Smith Road, but the renters, Will and Nancy Gambill, got out before the damage when they heard about the tornado warning. “They left and went to Walmart so nobody was at home, but it has got a lot of damage,” said Sandra Smith, the owner of the mobile home. Smith and her husband Stanley were at their house on Gentry Farm Road when the storm hit. “It didn’t hit our house but we have a streak of trees through the woods where it clipped them,” Sandra Smith said. Smith gathered together some relatives and took shelter in her own basement at the height of the storm. “There was a huge roaring noise in the fireplace,” she said. “I looked out and the trees were swaying real bad and it was dark, but we were fine in the basement.” Vickie and Bobby Boyles were in the den of their home on Marshall Smith Road when the storm hit. “The power kept blinking,” Vickie Boyles said. “And the next thing that happened was a racket. We looked at each other and both of us said, ‘What happened?’ We opened the door and there was so much mud on the storm door we couldn’t see out. And he opened the door and everything was gone.” The storm blew away the Boyles’ carport and left it scattered across the yard on the other side of the house. It blew the roof off the den where the couple had been during the storm. A mailbox and the electrical attachment to the house were both ripped away. The whole front of their house was spackled with little bits of insulation. “There’s lots and lots of trees down,” said Maj. Jeff Lemons, Stokes County Sheriff’s Office, who manned traffic control at an intersection on Marshall Smith Road. “I know of several areas where there are trees on houses and on porches. There’s been some barn roofs and outbuilding roofs blown off. I’ve seen a couple of hay barns and outbuildings blown off of their foundations.” Lemons said he was on the other side of Sauratown Mountain when the storm came across and that it “looked like the mountain split the storm.” Damage extended toward Lawsonville on the north side of the mountain, but authorities said it was not as bad there. As the storm made its way into Stokes County it downed trees onto U.S. 52, blocking the southbound lanes until the trees could be cleared away. Yadkin County first responders helped people in 10 damaged houses on Baity Road get out of their homes. The affected residents are staying with their relatives in Yadkin County, authorities said. The American Red Cross was also helping. Courtney Elementary will be closed today because of damage from the tornado. Stokes County schools are on a two-hour delay today, with the start of end-of-grade testing postponed to Friday, school officials said. Duke Energy said about 1,100 customers in Northwest North Carolina were without power about 10:30 p.m. Wednesday. wyoung@wsjournal.com 336-727-7369 @jhintonWSJ Homes destroyed by possible tornado in eastern Iredell At least two homes were destroyed by a possible tornado off Highway 64 in eastern Iredell County near the Davie County line.

TidewaterBiz Lidl opening stores in Newport News, Hampton this summer German grocer Lidl is opening a store in Newport News and a store in Hampton this summer. The Peninsula stores are among the first 20 Lidl stores to open in the U.S. German grocer Lidl is opening a store in Newport News and a store in Hampton this summer. The Peninsula stores are among the first 20 Lidl stores to open in the U.S. Tara BozickContact Reportertbozick@dailypress.com Privacy Policy German discount grocer Lidl announced plans to open stores at 2000 W. Mercury Blvd. in Hampton and 11076 Warwick Blvd. near Harpersville Road in Newport News this summer. The two Peninsula stores are part of Lidl's first 20 stores set to open in the United States, with the first stores opening June 15, the grocer said. Lidl hasn't revealed specific dates for the stores or which ones will be first. "We're so excited," Lidl US spokesman Will Harwood said. "We're getting very close." Lidl plans to open stores at 6196 Providence Road in Virginia Beach, 4033 Portsmouth Blvd. in Chesapeake and 6440 N. Military Highway in Norfolk and in Richmond this summer, according to a news release. The grocer also is opening stores in North Carolina and South Carolina. Lidl plans to open up to 100 stores on the East Coast by the summer of 2018, creating more than 5,000 jobs, the grocer said. Lidl, which is hiring locally, is constructing a store at Jefferson Avenue and City Center Boulevard and has plans for a store in the Lightfoot area of James City. German-based grocer Lidl is building at two locations in Newport News. One along Jefferson Avenue near City Center and another at Warwick Boulevard near Harpersville Road. Competitor Aldi recently opened next to Kohl's in the Jefferson Commons shopping center. (Daily Press) The stores will have a roughly 20,000-square-foot retail layout with six aisles and a bakery near the entrance, making it easy to pop in and out, Harwood said. The grocer sells certified sustainable seafood and about 90 percent of Lidl products are private label brands, including organic and gluten-free options. Lidl, which operates 10,000 stores across Europe, will import European items, including wines and Belgian chocolates, Harwood said. Pelican's SnoBalls on Warwick Boulevard across from Lidl could get more shopper attention and a new traffic light helps, too, General Manager Phillip Coon said. Tara Bozick Peninsula and Hampton Roads housing will be strongly affected by the needs of millennials and retiring baby boomers sooner rather than later, Rose & Womble Realty Co. Chief Operating Officer Van Rose said Thursday. "We've had three outstanding years of continual growth in the residential market.... Peninsula and Hampton Roads housing will be strongly affected by the needs of millennials and retiring baby boomers sooner rather than later, Rose & Womble Realty Co. Chief Operating Officer Van Rose said Thursday. "We've had three outstanding years of continual growth in the residential market.... (Tara Bozick) "From a business perspective, we're really excited about it," Coon said. "It's going to bring more life to the community, I think." Lidl, with its U.S. headquarters in Arlington, is competing with German grocer Aldi, which has a similar concept and recently opened two stores in Newport News. Aldi is planning to open a store on Saville Row off Mercury Boulevard about a mile from the Lidl store in Hampton. Peninsula stores that cater to discount shoppers — like Aldi, Dollar stores, Wal-Mart Neighborhood Market and Food Lion because of its number of stores — will be most affected by Lidl, although conventional supermarkets like Kroger and Farm Fresh could see some competition, too, said Jeff Metzger, publisher of supermarket trade publication Food World. "If you're in that discounter class of trade, you're going to go head to head," Metzger said. Bozick can be reached by phone at 757-247-4741.

The technology makes it easier for the grocer to stay current with caloric and nutritional information because it is connected to an ingredient database with real-time updates. (Courtesy | SpartanNash) Print Email Shandra Martinez | smartinez@mlive.com By Shandra Martinez | smartinez@mlive.com The Grand Rapids Press on May 24, 2017 at 10:00 AM, updated May 24, 2017 at 2:12 PM comments BYRON TOWNSHIP, MI -- If you have shopped at a Family Fare store lately, you might have noticed new digital menu boards at the deli detailing know many calories are in the panini you are ordering.  There are now signs or labeling for the grocer's baked goods, build-your-own salad bars and grab-and-go fresh items like sushi, soups and sandwiches.  SpartanNash, the Michigan-based grocer that operates 83 Family Fare stores in five states, decided to move ahead with new menu-labeling guidelines that were recently put on hold by the federal government.  "We want our store guests to make informed, better-for-you decisions when it comes to their meal options and portion sizes, and we believe the steps we have taken equip them to do just that," said Larry Pierce, SpartanNash executive vice president of merchandising and marketing, in a statement. But the Byron Township-headquartered grocer isn't investing in the additional signage at its Family Fresh Market, D&W Fresh Market and SunMart stores because the proposed rule only applies to restaurants and stores with at least 20 locations. Walker-based grocer Meijer will have the nutrition labeling and signage for prepared foods in place at all of its 230 Midwest stores by June, a spokesman told MLive and The Grand Rapids Press. Kroger is also currently working on adding caloric information to product labels to its prepared foods. In the meantime, customers can request nutrition information for food in the deli, soup and salad bar, sushi kiosks, and bakery.  Walmart didn't immediately respond to a request by MLive about where the retail giant stands on the proposed rule.  In the face of opposition from major industry groups, the Food and Drug Administration again postponed the rule requiring all "restaurant-type" food items to have calorie and nutritional information, similar to the way packaged food does. The rule was supposed to be far reaching to include prepared food sold by restaurants, grocery stores, convenience stores, gas stations and movie theaters. Family Fare is adding caloric and nutritional information on all prepared foods sold at its bakeries, build-your-own salad bars and grab-and-go fresh items like sushi, soups and sandwiches.Courtesy | SpartanNash  SpartanNash opted to meet the previous deadline of May 5, although days earlier the deadline was pushed back to May 7, 2018. The FDA has been slow to implement the menu labeling guidelines that were a provision of the Affordable Care Act, passed in 2010.  The most recent delay was hailed by Dr. Tom Price, President Trump's new Health and Human Services Secretary, who said he wanted to change the Obamacare rule to be "more flexible and less burdensome." The idea behind the menu labeling law is that people may forgo unhealthy foods if they know the calorie content. Educating people about their food choices is seen as a way to address obesity, one of the biggest drivers of preventable chronic diseases and healthcare costs in the United States.  While grocery and convenience stores have complained the rules are burdensome, the National Restaurant Association has said one federal rule is preferable to a patchwork of state laws that would be "even more burdensome," according to the Associated Press. A number of restaurant chains including McDonald's, Panera and Starbucks already list calories with menu items.   Michigan Prom Prom 2017: Photos from celebrations across Michigan Michigan's Best Craft distilleries of Michigan Craft distillery tour turns to Ann Arbor, Jackson and Kalamazoo Tell us your favorite Michigan craft distilleries, craft cocktails More Michigan's Best » Find Local Homes for Sale Apartments Car Dealers Used Cars Jobs Businesses Find a job Buy or sell a car Find a place to live See what's for sale Find a business View obituaries Connect with MLive Subscribe to our newsletters Like us on Facebook Subscribe on YouTube Most Read Active Discussions About Us MLive Media Group Our Team Advertise Frequently Asked Questions Contact Us Jobs at MLive Subscriptions Newspaper | Digital Editions | eNewsletters The Ann Arbor News The Bay City Times The Flint Journal The Grand Rapids Press Jackson Citizen Patriot Kalamazoo Gazette Muskegon Chronicle The Saginaw News MLive Sections News Business Sports High School Sports Entertainment Living Opinion Obituaries Jobs Autos Real Estate Apartment Rentals Classifieds Local Deals Local Businesses Business Resource Center Your Regional News Pages Ann Arbor Bay City Detroit Flint Grand Rapids Jackson Kalamazoo Lansing Muskegon Saginaw Mobile Mobile apps | Tablet apps More on MLive Photos Video Weather Post a job Post a free classified ad Sell your car Sell/Rent your home Apartments and Rentals Sponsor Content Follow Us Twitter | Facebook | YouTube Registration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy © 2017 MLive Media Group.

Authorities identified the suspect as Derick Montez Robinson, 43, of Hillsboro. Police Chief Clint Reck said Robinson is a registered sex offender due to a first-degree sexual abuse conviction. Reck said police have received complaints since Sunday about Robinson approaching and harassing women at various locations. "We've had three women come in and file reports," the chief said. "He's approaching females and making them feel uncomfortable with some of the things he's saying." He said video footage from Wal-Mart shows a man victims have identified as Robinson shoving a shopping cart into a female. A warrant has been issued on a misdemeanor harassment charge in connection with that event. Police said the suspect's vehicle is a black 1999 Chevrolet Silverado pickup with the license number 42AS196. He is 6 feet 2 inches tall and 217 pounds and could have a gold tooth, the chief said. Reck said anyone who sees someone matching the description of the suspect or a vehicle matching the description should call the law enforcement agency in the city or call 911.

In the new letter to the President, they argued that backing out of the agreement now, after the years of negotiations and strong U.S. leadership on the issue, would be a self-inflicted injury to America’s economy and leave U.S. interests unrepresented on the world stage. The Senators said that reneging on the agreement could put American health and safety at risk, and would leave the American economy and our small businesses to miss out on vital investment and job opportunities while the rest of the world moves forward with trillions of dollars of investment in resilient infrastructure, low-carbon energy, sustainable agriculture, and new technologies. “Backing out of the Paris Agreement now, after the years of painstaking negotiations and strong U.S. leadership it took to get the world to this point, would be a self-inflicted injury to America’s credibility and influence on the world stage,” wrote the Senators. “A U.S. retreat from the Paris Agreement would isolate us from the 196 nations working together within the framework of the Paris Agreement, reaching outcomes on international economic policy that will effect U.S. interests whether we are party or not. A retreat from Paris would harm the trust, faith, and goodwill that America has earned from other nations, and will inevitably harm our ability to work cooperatively to advance our foreign policy goals.” The senators who signed this letter to the President included: Chuck Schumer (D-NY), Dick Durbin (D-IL), Ben Cardin (D-MD), Tom Carper (M-DE), Maria Cantwell (D-WA), Ed Markey (D-MA), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Brian Schatz (D-HI), Al Franken (D-MN), Tom Udall (D-NM), Bob Menendez (D-NJ), Michael Bennet (D-CO), Patty Murray (D-WA), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Gary Peters (D-MI), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Kamala Harris (D-CA), Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Ron Wyden (D-OR), Bob Casey (D-PA), Jack Reed (D-RI), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Bill Nelson (D-FL), Mazie Hirono (D-HI), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), Chris Murphy (D-CT), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Tim Kaine (D-VA), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Martin Heinrich (D-NM), and Chris Coons (D-DE). A copy of the letter from the Senate Democrats appears below: President Donald Trump The White House 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW Washington, DC 20500 Dear Mr. President, We write to express our strong support for the Paris Climate Agreement, and to urge you to keep the United States party to the agreement. The reality of climate change is unforgiving. The three hottest years ever recorded were 2016, 2015, and 2014. The global temperature in 2017 is on pace to break this record yet again. American communities are already feeling the impacts of climate change. City streets from Boston to Baltimore to Miami are flooding at high tide. Western states are just now emerging from years of punishing drought. In recent weeks, extreme downpours have led to deadly floods in the South and Midwest. Doctors and scientists have identified climate change as a significant threat to Americans’ health. The pace and severity of these changes on a global scale prompted military experts in both the Bush and Obama Administrations to identify climate change as a national security threat. Faith leaders from around the world have called for urgent action to address climate change—and especially its impact on the poorest and most vulnerable. Simply put, climate change puts Americans’ health, safety, and livelihoods at risk. Businesses and the American people have taken notice. In 2015, more than 150 major U.S. companies, from Alcoa to Xerox, signed on to The American Business Act on Climate Pledge ahead of the Paris negotiations, and made their own commitments to reduce emissions, use cleaner energy sources, and boost sustainability. The Pledge reads, in part: “We support the conclusion of a climate change agreement in Paris that takes a strong step forward toward a low-carbon, sustainable future. We recognize that delaying action on climate change will be costly in economic and human terms, while accelerating the transition to a low-carbon economy will produce multiple benefits.” Since that time, more than 1,100 companies of all sizes, with combined annual revenue of $1.2 trillion, have affirmed their commitment for implementing the Paris Agreement by signing the Business Backs Low-Carbon USA pledge. Fossil fuel companies ExxonMobil, BP, and Shell, as well as iconic American companies like Walmart, Microsoft, Google, and Mars, support remaining a party. And ‎just this week, more than 200 global investors representing more than $15 trillion in assets wrote to the heads of the G7 nations, urging leaders to stand by the Paris Agreement. And support for this landmark international agreement goes beyond the corporate world, with majorities of Americans in every state saying that the United States should participate in the Paris Agreement. While American communities and businesses grapple with the impacts of climate change, we know that this is a global challenge—and it demands a global response. That is why the Paris Climate Agreement is so vital. For the first time, the Paris Agreement provides a platform in which all countries acknowledge that they have a responsibility to do their fair share to curb the carbon pollution that is driving climate change—including other major emitters like China and India. Backing out of the Paris Agreement now, after the years of painstaking negotiations and strong U.S. leadership it took to get the world to this point, would be a self-inflicted injury to America’s credibility and influence on the world stage. Over the next several years, parties to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change will meet to determine how the Paris Agreement will be implemented when it goes into effect in 2020. Issues of longstanding bipartisan interest will be discussed and decided in those meetings, including matters of transparency and verification of emissions reductions from other countries. A U.S. retreat from the Paris Agreement would isolate us from the 196 nations working together within the framework of the Paris Agreement, reaching outcomes on international economic policy that will effect U.S. interests whether we are party or not. A retreat from Paris would harm the trust, faith, and goodwill that America has earned from other nations, and will inevitably harm our ability to work cooperatively to advance our foreign policy goals. Our allies were insulted by the Bush Administration’s decision to withdraw from the Kyoto Protocol, and we suffered real foreign policy and diplomatic setbacks as a result. If the United States is not at the table as a participant in this process, our interests will not be represented. We will be left out and left behind, sitting on the sidelines with Syria and Nicaragua, the only other countries in the world not participating in the Paris agreement. Our economy and our small businesses will miss out on vital investment and job opportunities, while the rest of the world moves forward with trillions of dollars of investment in resilient infrastructure, low-carbon energy, sustainable agriculture, and new technologies. For the sake of our economy, our national security, and Americans’ health and future, we ask that the United States remain a party to the Paris Agreement and continue to participate in the UNFCCC process.

A family farmer, already sweating and tired from hours of hard work, loads his truck with the day's deliveries. One hundred miles later, he arrives at his first drop in Colorado Springs. A shiny new delivery truck blocks the alley at the rear of the locally owned restaurant. The farmer, with evening chores waiting, hurries to make his deliveries. But he's told to wait until the truck finishes unloading. Surprised and confused, the farmer sees his own produce coming off the truck — the same produce he delivered to a grocery store earlier that week. The restaurant buyer happily picks through the half-priced produce. Excited to greatly reduce his food cost, he rejects the farmer's order outright. Unfortunately, the same truck appears at other stops throughout the day. Finally, back home after dark and finished with chores, the farmer sorts through his mail. Among the bills, there's an envelope from a retail grocery store, the same customer that gave his produce to the competitor he saw throughout the day. In the envelope is a bill demanding payment for what the retail margin would have been had his produce sold. This scenario shows what could happen if the retail-to-restaurant model used by FoodMaven reaches its lofty goals. The concept of grocery stores dumping excess inventories on the restaurant and institutional food sector is so damaging, and yet so brilliant, for the modern food industry. Big retailers like the appearance of abundance, with their overflowing colorful displays. Most of the big food retailers sell very cheap, high-margin, industrially produced food. They calculate waste into their margins and into what they are willing to pay their suppliers. In many cases, the farmer is a vendor who helps finance the retailer, taking payment only if the product sells, likely with considerable delay. The retail-to-restaurant model works like Walmart's relationship to the dollar stores, except better. When grocery stores dump their waste into the food service sector, it doesn't compete with new sales. None of these players have any interest in increasing what the farmer gets for what he produces; they are all in the business of driving prices to unrealistic lows. Also, it's a win-win for big grocery retailers if their waste can be used to destroy the local/regional farm-to-table food movement, which they see as a threat, since it exists outside of their control and reduces their monopoly power. Big Food's monopoly has eliminated the critical supply-and-demand relationship between food producers and consumers. Farmers know that over-production, especially of a perishable product, kills the price. A cabbage farmer from New York State once said, "If I have any cabbage in excess of my demand, I'm better off plowing it under, lest I destroy the price for all my cabbage. At least I'm feeding my soil." Multinational agribusiness firms have monopolized the marketplace. They write farming, food and trade policy. They leverage farmer against farmer, region against region, and country against country to drive commodity prices as low as possible. As a result, imported food — including rotten beef from Brazil and chicken from China — has far easier access to the lucrative U.S. markets than our own family farmers. Since the 1996 farm bill, corporate-controlled farm policy has promoted a heavily industrialized, "get bigger or get out," strip-mining approach to farming that incentivizes farmers to plant from "fence row to fence row." This over-production provides cheap commodities to middlemen processors, distributors and retailers who have posted shamefully high profits year after year, at the direct expense of farmers, ranchers and consumers. This failed policy creates massive food waste, while contributing to farmer bankruptcies, loss of rural communities, historic soil loss, environmental degradation and declining human health. A new-fangled tech start-up modeled on Uber or Airbnb doesn't address the real problem of food waste. In fact, from the scene described above, it's easy to see how it ends up undercutting the farmers who make farm-to-table and truly good local food possible. The opportunistic mindset behind FoodMaven, of using steeply discounted food to make a buck, will only make it more difficult to re-localize, re-humanize and regenerate healthy food systems in the long run.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 24 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Terra Tech Corp. Expands Cannabis Cultivation Capabilities in Northern California with New „Craft Cultivation” Model /EINPresswire.com/ — IRVINE, CA–(Marketwired – May 24, 2017) – Terra Tech Corp. (OTCQX: TRTC) („Terra Tech” or the „Company”), a vertically integrated cannabis-focused agriculture company, today announced that it has launched a new „Craft Cultivation” model to expand its cultivation capabilities, signing its first „Craft Cultivator” in Northern California. This farm, which is approved for up to one full acre (approximately 44,000 square feet) of cannabis cultivation and uses 22,000 square feet of engineered greenhouse space, is estimated to yield approximately one metric ton of the Company’s proprietary high grade „IVXX” cannabis on an annual basis. Terra Tech has executed a one-year lease and operating contract with Panther Gap Farms, with the option to renew both the one-year lease and the operating contract a further three times in the following years. The property is located in Honeydew, CA, in Southern Humboldt County, in an area known as the „Emerald Triangle” that is home to some of the world’s highest quality cannabis products. Terra Tech is adopting a responsible, sustainable and all-natural cultivation methodology to ensure its proprietary IVXX strains are carefully selected and grown to minimize risks to people and the environment. Derek Peterson, CEO of Terra Tech Corp., commented, „We are proud to be implementing environmentally sustainable practices, and operating in a region and on an isolated site that lends itself to contaminant-free cultivation. Each Craft Cultivator is hand selected because of their unique ability to produce high quality product using sustainable farming practices. Working with artisanal growers and using an all-natural cultivation methodology aligns with our commitment to producing premium quality cannabis products for our customers. We are pleased to expand our cultivation footprint while allowing IVXX to elevate in both quality and consistency. This extension of our cultivation capabilities into the Emerald Triangle, home to some of the world’s finest cannabis, will help us to expand both the Company’s product line and margins over the coming year.” Salwa Ibrahim commented, „Humboldt County was the first of California’s 58 Counties to issue a cannabis cultivation ordinance in compliance with MCRSA. The County has very effectively developed its regulations to protect and preserve the community and ecology of Humboldt County while also supporting the legal cannabis industry and helping it to flourish responsibly in a regulated environment. We are excited at the prospect of cultivating cannabis in this region.” IVXX cannabis is grown and harvested under the safest and most beneficial conditions, free of toxic pesticides, harmful molds and chemical residues. All products are thoughtfully produced, rigorously tested and certified to the highest standards of potency and purity. The project is fully compliant with the Medical Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act („MCRSA”), the California Department of Fish & Wildlife and the Humboldt County Commercial Cannabis Cultivation Ordinance. Additionally, the property is registered with the North Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board, and is one of only 15 cannabis businesses enrolled in the Humboldt County Medical Cannabis Track and Trace pilot program.
