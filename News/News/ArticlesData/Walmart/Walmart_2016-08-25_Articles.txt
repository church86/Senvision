Her sweet potato pie was a smash-hit last year for Walmart, her exclusive retailer. Now she’s expanding her line to include five new desserts: berry cobbler, apple cobbler, peach cobbler, apple pecan cake and sweet potato loaf. LaBelle’s sweet potato pie hit stores last August, but it wasn’t a huge success until Youtube star James Wright Chanel sang its praises in a expletive-laced video that went viral. Video contains curse words. Viewer discretion advised. “I want to taste Patti live,” said Wright, breaking into song as soon as he dug in. “You turn into Patti after eating this! Go to Walmart and buy the Patti LaBelle pie.” After that video came out in November, LaBelle’s sweet potato pie sold like hot cakes. “We were selling one per second for a while after his video went live,” said Walmart spokesman John Forrest Ales. “He posted that video and we sold out and had to quickly make more, a million pounds.” And it wasn’t just a Thanksgiving thing. Even after the holidays the pies were still selling, so Walmart has been churning them out year round even though they were originally meant to be a seasonal item. “It’s pretty insane that it’s August and people are still buying the sweet potato pie,” said Ales. LaBelle fans may want to brace themselves for a bit of sticker shock, though. While the sweet potato pie costs $3.98, the cobblers are $6.98, the apple pecan cake costs $9.98. LaBelle was not immediately available for comment.

Food & Dining Patti LaBelle unveils new cobblers, cakes for Walmart -- how do they taste? Patti’s Good Life Peach Cobbler Walmart The peach cobbler dropped off to us had a flat top, which looked fine but did not sport the eye appeal of this undulating landscape of golden brown pastry. The peach cobbler dropped off to us had a flat top, which looked fine but did not sport the eye appeal of this undulating landscape of golden brown pastry. (Walmart) Joseph HernandezContact Reporter 'Shout out to Patti LaBelle, honey!” And with that auspicious beginning, James Wright Chanel’s YouTube love letter to Patti LaBelle’s branded sweet potato pie went viral — to the tune of 5 million views and counting. Put another way, the video was so popular that the pie (sold exclusively at Walmart) was flying off the shelves at the rate of one pie per second for 72 hours. Hoping that lightning strikes twice — or, y’know, 5 million times — Walmart today announced the release of its latest partnership with LaBelle in the form of the Patti’s Good Life brand of pies and desserts. The line features peach, berry and apple cobblers (each $6.98), an apple pecan cake ($9.98) and a sweet potato loaf ($4.48), all available nationwide, starting next week, except the loaf, which is only available in select stores. Here at the Tribune, we got a first taste of everything except the loaf in our test kitchen. Will these inspire more viral videos? Check out our tasting notes below. Patti Labelle's cobblers Walmart Patti’s Good Life cobblers for Walmart include berry (a mix of raspberries, blackberries, blueberries and boysenberries, aka bumbleberry; see our recipe for bumbleberry pie!), apple and peach. Patti’s Good Life cobblers for Walmart include berry (a mix of raspberries, blackberries, blueberries and boysenberries, aka bumbleberry; see our recipe for bumbleberry pie!), apple and peach. (Walmart) Patti’s Good Life Peach Cobbler: Each of the cobblers (all clocking in at just under 2 pounds) list the named fruit on the ingredients list, followed by sugar (not today, corn syrup!). If an attached press release is to be believed, 6.4 million pounds of peaches go into the Patti’s Good Life line; this pie is loaded. A top crust is covered in cinnamon, which is aromatic but actually distracts from the cobbler’s sweetness. Too much cinnamon on the interior turned the tasters off. Not a strong showing on this round. Patti’s Good Life Berry Cobbler: Stuffed with raspberries, blackberries, blueberries and boysenberries, the (bumble)berry cobbler was a favorite for the tasting team. The right balance of sweet to tart, the jewel-toned filling was surprisingly set and not just a puddle of goo — the bottom crust was enjoyably crisp and buttery even as we freed the cobbler from its aluminum pan prison. Plus side? The cobblers are not sold frozen, so they don’t need to be heated to be enjoyed, but heating them through does offer a bit of that “fresh baked” sensation. Patti’s Good Life Apple Cobbler: The texture on the apple cobbler was spot on. Made with Fuji apples, the filling was toothsome yet soft, with a nicer, more balanced mixture of cinnamon and sugar than the peach. The apples have retained a bit of their tartness, which is nice with the pastry crust. Patti’s Good Life Apple Pecan Cake Walmart We liked the cake itself but not the frosting. We liked the cake itself but not the frosting. (Walmart) Patti’s Good Life Apple Pecan Cake: Our team was turned off by the near-impenetrable helmet of buttercream icing and too-rich caramel goo. The cake itself — a Southern-style layer cake of Fuji apples and Georgia pecans — is tasty and would make a good accompaniment to coffee or tea. Just get past the overly rich, heavy-handed application of icing first. Overall, these treats — in particular, the apple and berry cobblers — offer good value and flavor. Not sure if I’d break out into song over these, but I’ll admit that they have their high notes. jbhernandez@chicagotribune.com Twitter @joeybear85         First, we found the best hot chocolate in Chicago.

(Photo: HEIDI HEILBRUNN/Staff)Buy Photo 15 CONNECTTWEET 4 LINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE For more than a century, grocery stores have been trying to find innovating ways to get your business. In 1896, it was S&H Green Stamps. That evolved to double coupons, buy-one-get-one free sales and fuel discounts. As technology advances, grocers realize that convenience and time are prime considerations for customers and will do your shopping for you, provided you give them a list. The latest store to shop for you began operations this week when four Upstate Walmart stores began offering a program that lets shoppers place an order online and drive to a designated pickup parking area at Walmart where an employee will bring the order out to the customer’s vehicle. But they are not the only store that offers shopping for you in the Upstate. In January, Publix shoppers were introduced to the services of a delivery company called Shipt which sends online orders direct to the homes of online customers throughout the Upstate. The Lowes store, which is currently under construction in Five Forks, will features its own version of online delivery shopping service called Lowes Foods-to-Go. These stores are trying to stay ahead in what’s become a very competitive environment. In Simpsonville alone, there are more than 10 full-sized grocery stores and the total continues to increase. A pair of Walmart Neighborhood Markets opened in Simpsonville in 2015 and 2016, respectively, and a Lowes Foods store is scheduled to open in the spring of 2017.

Walmart has launched an online grocery pick up at four Greenville-area store.  (Photo: HEIDI HEILBRUNN/Staff) Convenience is key “We’re looking for our customer base to take advantage of this 100 percent free service,” said Mark Grider, who’s Walmart’s E-Commerce Market Coach for South Carolina. “It’s extremely convenient to be able to make your own orders sitting at home. “You don’t have to worry about bringing your kids in, finding a parking spot or getting through the checkout lines.” In addition to the Walmart website, there’s also an app for the new program. A minimum total purchase of at least $30 is required. Grider says customers call when they’ve arrived during a pickup time they’ve selected, and the order is delivered within five minutes. The new program began Thursday at Walmart Supercenters in Greenville (1451 Woodruff Road.) and Anderson (2003 E. Greenville St.), and at Walmart Neighborhood Markets in Simpsonville (1401 W. Georgia Road.) and Travelers Rest (9 Benton Road.). The program began in South Carolina in April with nine Walmart locations in the Charleston area. It’s also available in six Columbia-area stores as well. Grider said with the program still in its early stages, orders need to be placed a day in advance of pickup. He added that changes can be made to the order by 10 a.m. on the day of pickup. ENTERTAINMENT: Festivals fuel economy LOCAL: Furman to build $1.7M solar farm The pickup service features more than 30,000 items for sale. Grider said those aren’t limited to groceries, which is especially true for the larger Supercenters. “There are a few specific items you can’t order online (for pickup): large, bulky items, TVs, bikes, furniture and most apparel. Tobacco, alcohol and firearms are not allowed (to be purchased this way) in South Carolina,” Grider said. “Outside of that, you can order pretty much anything through the site.” At the Woodruff Road Walmart, there were 25 online orders placed on the opening day Thursday and another 25 placed Friday. One of those customers Friday was Scott Smith, who traveled from his Greer home to pick up various grocery items as well as a couple of air filters. “My wife says I don’t like stores, but I don’t mind picking something up once I’ve ordered it and I’m less likely to buy more things,” Smith said. “So she ordered it all and said, ‘go pick it up.’ I really like the whole concept.” Grider said the lack of impulse buys by online customers was a consideration during the process of deciding to offer the service. He said the positives have far outweighed any negatives. When placing an order online, other recommendations will be presented based on what a customer has selected. Grider said that kind of serves as the impulse item for online. “The fact that we’re offering this level of convenience has increased the number of shopping trips for our customers versus those trips into the store,” Grider said. “In turn, that balances everything out.” Buy Photo Cathy Booker, Walmart department manager, picks produce for an online order Friday. Walmart has launched an online grocery pick up at four Greenville-area store.  (Photo: HEIDI HEILBRUNN/Staff) ‘A life-saver for a working mom’ Shipt’s annual plan costs $99 per year or $14 per month. All Publix grocery items are available for delivery, which is offered on the same day in as little as one hour. There’s no delivery charge on orders of at least $35. Simpsonville mother of three, Kellyn Finlay, began utilizing Shipt soon after it was offered and at a time when she was “very, very pregnant.” Finlay and her husband are both teachers, and their children are ages 6, 4 and 4 months. “It (Shipt) really is a life-saver for a working mom,” Finlay said. “I hate sucking up time on the weekends to have to go to the grocery store. That’s the only downtime we have as a family. “When you’re shopping for five people, a grocery store trip takes forever.” In the weeks before and after her baby was born, Finlay said “it was so nice” to not make one trip to the grocery store. That’s still the case now that school is back in session. “After you’ve been at work all day and you’ve picked up all your kids, the last thing you want to do is go to the grocery store,” Finlay said. “You don’t want to take your kids home, get them settled and go back out to the grocery store either.” Finlay said she especially enjoys the ease of service. She said she can place an order through Shipt’s app on her phone during her planning period at school and have it delivered soon after she gets home. Finlay said if her Publix is out of a brand she ordered, she will get a text asking if she’d like a different brand of the same product. She also receives a text when the order is on its way to her home. In addition to beating the hustle and bustle inside of her local Publix, Finlay said the delivery service also helps her avoid the traffic outside it. “If I don’t have to battle Fairview Road, that $99 a year is worth it to me,” Finlay said.

Grider said it’s an important factor, especially when it comes to choosing produce and meats. “When we bring the groceries out we show the customer every piece of produce we’ve selected,” Grider said. “If we get you bananas that are too green, we will stop and go back and get you more of what you’re looking for.” “This is just where the businesses are going. E-commerce is really kind of taking the retail market by storm,” Grider said. “It’s growing year after year and customers are demanding the ability to do this to save time.” 15 CONNECTTWEET 4 LINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://grnol.co/2bvXFZw TOP VIDEOS Passengers Evacuated to Tarmac During Shooting 1:38 AP Top Stories January 6 P 1:13 Connected Devices Raise Security Concerns 2:09 AP Top Stories January 6 A 1:00 NOAA Plans to Expand Fish Farming in Pacific 1:56 Farm Sculpted Out of Thousand Pounds of Butter 0:45 Farm Sculpted Out of Thousand Pounds of Butter 0:45 Pelosi and Pro-Choice Groups Ready To Fight 1:30 Ryan Backs Intel Community, but Defends Trump 1:16 Sears seeks to stem bleeding: closes more stores, sells Craftsman brand 0:35

By Joel Berg, August 26, 2016 at 5:00 PM It was an early sign of trouble for Apple Pay: Cashiers staring in curiosity as I waved my iPhone in front of credit-card readers. I persisted in pursuit of what I thought would be the future of payments: credit and debit cards linked to smartphones. The so-called mobile wallet is still coming, just not as quickly or in the form you might have expected. The challenge for businesses, especially smaller ones, is to figure out what technology they need to invest in to attract and retain customers. The average American shopper is expected to spend more than $3,000 using mobile devices in 2019, up from an expected $721.47 this year, according to research company eMarketer. Even the biggest technology companies have yet to find the right app to capture that growth. Apple Pay and its cousins, Android Pay and Samsung Pay, are struggling to convince people to stop using plastic and start using their phones, according to industry experts. Retailers like CVS, Starbucks and Walmart, on the other hand, appear to be having more success. Can you pay me now? Walmart Pay is ready for a close-up. Open the app, log in, scan the QR code to pay. - (Joel Berg) The puzzle mobile payments must solve in the U.S. is fairly straightforward: How do you replace what is already a streamlined process? I don’t save much time pulling out my iPhone instead of reaching into my wallet and sliding out a credit card. So far, the shoppers who wield their phones tend to be the people who like to try new things, said Daniel Van Dyke, an analyst with Javelin Strategy & Research, a financial services research firm based in Pleasanton, Calif. The novelty wears off. According to figures from Javelin, people are paying less often with their phones. Between 2013 and 2015, the mean number of monthly transactions per user fell from 3.7 to 3. “That’s because users who stick on the platform realize they’re not getting anything out of it,” Van Dyke said. “It’s a major problem these providers have to address.” To entice users, Android, Apple and Samsung have been handing out incentives. Samsung Pay, for example, offered gift cards this spring to first-time users. Companies also are exploring how to incorporate loyalty rewards.  Retailers, however, don’t have to experiment. They can offer all kinds of rewards from the get-go, starting with the ability to order ahead and skip lines, a feature available from Starbucks, the sandwich chain Subway and others. Walmart Pay, meanwhile, incorporates the company’s promise of low prices. The payment process for Walmart Pay is not much different than the one for Apple Pay, as I learned during a recent demonstration at the Walmart in Silver Spring Township, Cumberland County. But after you buy your goods using Walmart Pay, you can use the app to scan for lower prices at competing retailers. Any savings are totted up and stored on a gift card for spending later. At Walmart, of course. It’s likely someone already is figuring out how to incorporate the app into the Black Friday experience. There will be apps for that The good news for smaller businesses is that they don’t have to jump on the Apple/Android/Samsung Pay bandwagon. The bad news is that they risk being leapfrogged by larger competitors with millions of dollars to invest. “Those companies are transforming the way they receive payments,” said Robb Gaynor, chief product officer at Malauzai, a Texas-based provider of digital banking products. But where there is money, there are solutions. Over the next few years, technology companies, credit card companies and financial institutions are likely to find ways to help smaller businesses accept mobile payments, Gaynor said. In fact, Malauzai recently worked with a community bank in California to develop a payments app for a business customer, Gaynor said. “Our take on it is the banks are in a unique position to help, especially the local businesses,” he said. And if you’re wondering whether people really want a bunch of payment apps on their phones? Consumers are used to juggling credit cards. They will get used to juggling multiple payment apps. “Starbucks ain’t going away and neither is Apple Pay,” Gaynor said. “And neither of them is going to hold all of the market.” More from the Fast Forward Blog • A rising tide won't lift sinking ships • Six predictions for 2017 • The Fed sends a blockchain letter you shouldn't ignore • Rejecting 'Reefer Madness': Changing laws, changing minds Share This Story: Twitter Facebook Google+ LinkedIn   Joel Berg Joel Berg is editor of the Central Penn Business Journal.

By Jamie Grill-Goodman — August 26, 2016 After several quarters of disappointing online sales, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.'s e-commerce sales increased 11.8% in its second quarter 2017 with U.S. e-commerce results stronger than key international markets for the retailer. While one quarter of sales acceleration doesn't spell success, Walmart has been making huge moves to grow its online sales. The retailer recently agreed to purchase e-commerce retailer Jet.com, Inc. for approximately $3 billion in cash, an acquisition could give Walmart's online business the edge it needs to compete with Amazon.  In July, after months of gradually rolling out Walmart Pay, the mobile payment solution became available in all Walmart stores in the U.S. In China, Walmart recently announced it will sell its Yihaodian website to JD.com Inc. JD's significant presence online, where Wal-Mart and Sam's Club will feature prominently, allows Walmart the opportunity to extend the reach of its brands to millions of new customers. "Whether it’s through online grocery, Walmart Pay, or broadening our reach in China through the alliance with JD.com, we're making it easier for customers to access products when and how they want," said Brett Biggs, EVP & CFO, Walmart. "Now, with the agreement to acquire Jet.com, we're building on our e-commerce foundation and creating an opportunity to accelerate e-commerce even further." Walmart has also broadened its e-commerce assortment and expanded online grocery pickup to 30 more markets this quarter bringing the total to more than 60 markets and nearly 400 locations. Since the beginning of the year, Walmart added about 7 million new items to the marketplace assortment and now offers approximately 15 million SKUs.   "The distinctions that we talk about today between stores, apps, pick-up, delivery and sites are continuing to blur into the background for customers," noted Doug McMillon, President & CEO Walmart. "For them, it’s just Walmart." New Leadership Walmart's current global e-commerce chief, Neil Ashe, will leave the company by the end of the fiscal year. Once the Jet.com acquisition is complete, Marc Lore, current President and CEO of Jet.com will become Walmart's new President and CEO of e-commerce, reporting to McMillon. Lore will be responsible for both the Walmart and Jet brands in the U.S. Not only is Lore the founder of Jet.com; he also co-founded Quidsi, which owned Diapers.com, Soap.com, and Wag.com, before it was sold to Amazon in 2011.  During Ashe's tenure, Walmart more than doubled its e-commerce GMV, became the second most trafficked e-commerce site in the U.S., re-platformed Walmart.com, and opened a national fulfillment center network. "Building on this solid foundation, we made some strategic decisions to position ourselves for the future in the priority markets of the U.S. and China, including the announcement last week to acquire Jet.com," said McMillon. "Operating Walmart.com and Jet.com will allow us to reach even more customers and drive a higher level of growth more quickly. One of the things we like about the technology they've developed is that it rewards customers in real-time with savings on a basket of goods and puts them more in charge of the price they pay." Jet has created a unique way to deliver the lowest cost basket online and building a basket of goods rather than ordering one item at a time allows shipping economics in Walmart's favor. Customers won’t see changes immediately, however, as Walmart awaits government approval and the necessary tech platform changes. "While there is still a lot of work to do in executing our multi-year plan, we're encouraged by the results we're seeing," said Biggs.

Now she’s expanding her line to include five new desserts: berry cobbler, apple cobbler, peach cobbler, apple pecan cake and sweet potato loaf. LaBelle’s sweet potato pie hit stores last August, but it wasn’t a huge success until Youtube star James Wright Chanel sang its praises in a expletive-laced video that went viral. “I want to taste Patti live,” said Wright, breaking into song as soon as he dug in. “You turn into Patti after eating this! Go to Walmart and buy the Patti LaBelle pie.” After that video came out in November, LaBelle’s sweet potato pie sold like hot cakes. “We were selling one per second for a while after his video went live,” said Walmart spokesman John Forrest Ales. “He posted that video and we sold out and had to quickly make more, a million pounds.” And it wasn’t just a Thanksgiving thing. Even after the holidays the pies were still selling, so Walmart has been churning them out year round even though they were originally meant to be a seasonal item. “It’s pretty insane that it’s August and people are still buying the sweet potato pie,” said Ales. LaBelle fans may want to brace themselves for a bit of sticker shock, though. While the sweet potato pie costs $3.98, the cobblers are $6.98, the apple pecan cake costs $9.98. LaBelle was not immediately available for comment.

Starting Sept. 2, Walmart will sell premium cobblers in peach, apple and mixed berry flavors. Inspired by a recipe from one of LaBelle’s cookbooks, the cobblers are baked with crusts on top and bottom. Houston-based Walmart supplier Twin Star Bakery will make the pies, which will be sold fresh rather than frozen. Patti LaBelle's cobblers will come in peach, apple and mixed berry flavors. (Photo courtesy of Walmart) In the Northeast, the retailer also plans to roll out LaBelle’s apple pecan cake and sweet potato pound cake. Walmart launched the original #PattiPie last November. It proved so popular that stores had trouble keeping the sweet potato pies on the shelves. In January, the retailer expanded the line with premium vanilla pound cake and premium caramel cake and created a website where customers could search to see if Patti LaBelle bakery products were available in their local store. Rush noted Walmart added 60 new items to the bakery in 2015. “Today, more than half of our items are prepared in our stores, and we’ve enriched our teams across the country with bakery technicians who’ve been training and helping our store associates to ensure everything comes out exactly right,” said Rush. “On top of that, we’re simplifying our processes so that we can bake many different items at one temperature, allowing us to produce more fresh-baked goods for our customers every day.” TAGS: News Walmart 0 comments Hide comments Comment * More information about text formats Text format CommentsPlain text Comments Allowed HTML tags: <em> <strong> <blockquote> <br> <p> Plain text No HTML tags allowed.

Show Caption Hide Caption Previous Next DENVER - Target’s recent woes on Wall Street has consumers and analysts pondering why Target is tumbling. It's prompted the question: Is Target really that off on prices? Everybody likes to save money, even if it’s just a couple of cents. That may be why one the nation’s largest retailer is struggling. Target Corp. cut its profit forecast and a key sales outlook last week as it saw fewer customers in its stores.  Target struggled to get its grocery offerings right and shoppers looking for deals on essentials like detergent were turned off.  Denver7 wanted to find out if the Minneapolis-based retailer is competitive in the grocery aisle. We checked prices at both Target and Walmart. We created a 26-item list before hitting the stores. The prices in this comparison were checked on Thursday August 25. We visited the Target store in Sheridan and the Walmart location on Hampden Avenue in Englewood. The basics are there, like bread and milk, but items on the list are just a small fraction of what a busy family might purchase on a typical grocery trip. What did we find out? It might not be a surprise to most savvy shoppers, but Walmart came out ahead - but only by a few dollars. Our total at the nation’s largest retailer (before tax) came to $78.76. Target, on the other hand, was $80.68 - that’s a difference of just a $1.92. Another disclaimer: Some of the items we compared on our list were on sale at Target, so the difference would be a few dollars more if the items on the list were purchased on a different date. Walmart beats ‘em by pennies Walmart not only came out the pricing champ, it was the low price leader on virtually every item we compared to Target’s non-sale regular price - however we’re talking pennies here. Walmart shoppers may know the retailer never prices anything ending in .99. They often price their products just a couple cents off the dollar, like a box of Oreos for $2.98. Target sells the same box of cookies for $2.99. Although the price differences on the items we compared often came down to a few cents, some things on our list had wider price gaps. Beef for instance was more than 30 percent higher at Target.  Variety is the spice of life Another reason people may be choosing Walmart over Target is the selection offered at the Arkansas-based retailer. One of things we noticed during our price comparison is that Walmart’s aisles appeared to be fuller and offered more of a selection than Target. While Target appeared cleaner and more organized.  Target reported net income for the quarter of $680 million, or $1.16 per share. That compares with $753 million, or $1.18 per share, a year earlier. Adjusted per-share earnings were $1.23, beating projections of $1.14 from Wall Street, according to a survey by Zacks Investment Research. Revenue fell 7 percent to $16.2 billion. --------- Sign up for Denver7 email alerts to stay informed about breaking news and daily headlines.

Here's what you should know. Matthew Frankel (TMFMathGuy) Aug 26, 2016 at 10:42AM Image source: The Motley Fool. In Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B) latest Securities and Exchange Commission filing, it was revealed that the company boosted its stake in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) by 55% during the second quarter and sold a significant number of its Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) stock, to name the two most significant moves. While I never advise buying or selling a particular stock just because a billionaire does, here's what investors should learn from these moves. Adding to Apple while it's cheap During the second quarter, Berkshire added another 5.42 million shares of Apple to its portfolio, increasing its stake by 55%. And, to be fair, the Apple investment isn't Buffett's doing -- rather, one of his stock pickers pulled the trigger on the tech giant. However, the Apple purchase and its subsequent add-on are very Buffett moves. Here are a few Apple characteristics that Buffett tends to look for: An extremely powerful brand name: Other major Buffett holdings (Coca-Cola, Kraft Heinz, American Express) all have some of the most recognizable brand names in the world. Trades cheaply: As of this writing, Apple trades for a low multiple of 12.8 times trailing-12-month (TTM) earnings. Minuscule debt load (relatively speaking): Apple has a little more than $70 billion in debt, but also has more than $230 billion in cash and marketable securities. Plus, Apple's debt is at a low average effective interest rate of 2.47%. A record of growth and profitability: Apple has grown its revenue and profits impressively in every single year over the past decade or so, including during the tumultuous 2008-2010 period. I could go on, but the point is that even though Buffett didn't decide to invest in it, Apple certainly makes sense in Berkshire's portfolio. And while we don't know exactly when Berkshire added on to its Apple holdings, or at what price, I suspect that a major reason was simply that Apple got even cheaper during most of the second quarter. AAPL data by YCharts. This is one of the most valuable lessons any long-term investor can learn. When you do your research and buy the stock of an excellent company and it proceeds to drop like a rock, don't panic and sell. Instead, look at it as a valuable opportunity to add to your position at a discount. And I believe that has a lot to do with Berkshire's increased stake. Know when to walk away During the second quarter, Berkshire sold 27% of its Wal-Mart stake, leaving Berkshire with 40.2 million shares. This follows the smaller unloading of 950,000 shares during the first quarter. While 40.2 million shares of Wal-Mart are still worth nearly $3 billion -- no small chunk of change -- I have a feeling the selling is not done just yet. To explain why, consider the reasons why Buffett bought Wal-Mart in the first place. Berkshire started to accumulate Wal-Mart shares rather aggressively in 2005 and more than doubled its stake in the years following the financial crisis. First of all, at the time Buffett bought Wal-Mart, shares were trading cheaply. In the 2009-2012 period, when Berkshire accumulated about 26.7 billion shares, Wal-Mart was trading at price-to-earnings multiples between 11 and 15. Today, Wal-Mart trades for about 16.4 times TTM earnings. What's more, the company's revenue and especially its earnings growth was much better when Buffett was buying. Fiscal Year Revenue Earnings Per Share Revenue Growth EPS Growth 2009 $405.6 $3.35 7.1% 6% 2010 $408.2 $3.72 0.6% 11% 2011 $421.8 $4.18 3.3% 12.4% 2012 $447.0 $4.54 6% 8.6% 2013 $469.2 $5.02 5% 10.6% 2014 $476.3 $4.85 1.5% -3.4% 2015 $485.7 $4.99 2% 2.9% 2016 $482.1 $4.57 -0.7% -8.4% Data source: S&P Global Market Intelligence. Revenue in billions. In a nutshell, the high earnings growth and low valuation of the 2009-2013 period made Wal-Mart highly attractive. The higher valuation of today combined with two out of three years of negative EPS growth, not so much. Furthermore, Wal-Mart has more of an identifiable competitive advantage in those years. Amazon.com has since evolved into much more of a competitive threat, and Buffett even said in May that Wal-Mart is under pressure to compete with Amazon. It remains to be seen whether Berkshire intends to completely wind down its position in Wal-Mart or if it simply wanted to reduce its exposure to a potential price war with Amazon. Either way, the lesson is clear: When your original reasons for buying a stock no longer apply, it's OK to rethink your investment and, if necessary, head for the exits. The bottom line Warren Buffett is perhaps the most closely followed investor in the world, not just for the particular stocks he buys but for the timeless investing lessons that can be learned from what he buys and sells. The point here is not that you should buy Apple or sell Wal-Mart, but to apply these lessons to the stocks in your own portfolio and to stocks that you're considering.

Wal-Mart's e-commerce sales accelerated last quarter. Can it keep it up? Adam Levy (adamlevy) Aug 26, 2016 at 10:35AM Image source: Wal-Mart The story at Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) for the past year or so has been its declining online sales growth. E-commerce growth went from 16% in the second quarter of last year to 10% in the third quarter before falling into single-digit territory for two straight quarters. Last quarter, e-commerce sales started to rebound, growing 12% year over year. But one quarter of sales acceleration doesn't make a comeback. With a lot of rearrangement in its e-commerce divisions, Wal-Mart is setting itself up for continued growth in online sales. Dropping the dead weight in China Until recently, Wal-Mart operated a site called Yihaodian in China. It bought a 51% stake in the company in 2012, and it bought out the remaining 49% last year for $760 million. After struggling to grow the business, Wal-Mart sold the company to JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) for a 5% stake in the leading Chinese e-commerce company. That stock was worth about $1.5 billion at the time of the agreement, roughly the same value Wal-Mart bought out Yihaodian for last year. The fact that Wal-Mart was unable to increase the value of Yihaodian over the past year is indicative of slow sales growth. It's possible the tie-up with JD.com will help spur sales, considering its success with e-commerce in China. Shedding that slow-growing property from its e-commerce platform may allow whatever growth is happening on its websites in the rest of the world to shine through. That's not really sales acceleration, but it makes the numbers look good. What could actually spur acceleration is the other part of Wal-Mart and JD's agreement. Wal-Mart will establish a store on JD.com under its Sam's Club brand. Additionally, JD.com will list Wal-Mart as a preferred retailer on JD.com's O2O JV Dada, China's largest crowd-sourced delivery platform. Bringing in Jet propulsion Earlier this month, Wal-Mart purchased Jet.com for $3 billion in cash and $300 million in stock. Jet is one of the fastest growing e-commerce start-ups in the United States, and it instantly adds about $1 billion in gross merchandise volume to Wal-Mart's operations. That's about a 7% boost to Wal-Mart's 2015 e-commerce sales. With the acquisition, Wal-Mart is bringing on Marc Lore to lead its e-commerce business. Not only did he start Jet.com; he also started Quidsi, which owned Diapers.com, Soap.com, and Wag.com, before Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) bought the company in 2011. Wal-Mart's previous head of e-commerce, Neil Ashe, was a digital-media guy -- not an e-commerce guy. With Lore at the helm, Wal-Mart could see some improvements in its e-commerce operations from a seasoned vet with a track record of growing companies. Growing investments On top of Wal-Mart's blockbuster acquisition of Jet.com, the company plans to spend $900 million on improving its e-commerce platform this year. Next year, that number will climb to $1.1 billion. That's up from $700 million in fiscal 2016. A large chunk of that money is earmarked for building more fulfillment centers to compete with Amazon Prime's two-day shipping. Earlier this year, Wal-Mart launched ShippingPass, which offers the same two-day shipping perk of Amazon Prime. It doesn't include the bevy of other benefits Amazon offers Prime members, such as video and music streaming, free e-book rentals, unlimited cloud storage for photos, and more, but it's half the price at just $49 per year. Wal-Mart is also investing in expanding its online grocery ordering. CEO Doug McMillan specifically pointed to online grocery sales as a reason for the acceleration of Wal-Mart's e-commerce sales in the second quarter. Online grocery pickup is currently available in just 60 markets and 400 locations. Considering Wal-Mart has over 5,000 locations and nearly 3,500 Supercenters in the United States, it has a lot of room to grow that part of its business. Online grocery pickup, in particular, takes advantage of Wal-Mart's brick-and-mortar locations -- its biggest advantage over Amazon. If Wal-Mart can continue to leverage its physical locations through innovative supply chain management or online ordering options, it could continue to accelerate sales. Amazon has continued to grab share of the market as Wal-Mart's sales slow. If Wal-Mart's big investments don't help turn around its sales growth, it will be a major blow to the company; overall revenue growth came in at just 0.7% through the first half of fiscal 2017 after flat revenue in the first half of last year. The company is counting on e-commerce to keep that number moving in the right direction. Adam Levy owns shares of Amazon.com. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Amazon.com.

Earlier this month, Walmart was ordered by South Carolina Department of Transportation to stop all roadwork associated with the construction of the superstore and Sam’s Club that are being built across the street from Kittie’s Crossing. Stafford Bluffton, which owns the outparcel where Giuseppi’s Pizza and Pasta, AAA Carolinas, Palm Beach Tan, Panda Chinese Restaurant and La Hacienda are located, filed a temporary restraining order against Walmart, along with the retail giant’s contractor and developer, McCrory Construction and Jaz Development. North Bluffton Properties owns the remaining property in Kittie’s Crossing and is also named among the defendants. The court documents filed say the elongated median was built without permission from Stafford. The property owner is asking that an injunction be placed against the defendants and that the new median be removed and the old median replaced. Questions about whether the retailer received permission from North Bluffton Properties remain unanswered. Roberts Vaux, a legal representative for North Bluffton Properties, said Tuesday afternoon that the parties involved met for a hearing that morning and came to a short-term agreement that does not resolve all the issues. He said he could not comment on the details of that agreement. Phillip Keene, director of corporate communications for Walmart, wrote in an email Thursday that Walmart was working with SCDOT and others to address some of the concerns raised about the median and other traffic controls at the intersection. “We’re grateful for the feedback we have received and will continue to address concerns quickly and appropriately,” he wrote. “At this time, due to legal matters, it would not be appropriate for us to comment any further on this project.” Will Euart, vice president of Stafford Properties (also known as Stafford Bluffton), said Tuesday morning he could not comment on the agreement. The consent order was signed Aug. 16 by Stafford’s attorney, Russell Patterson — the same day the SCDOT ordered Walmart to stop working on Bluffton roads. A representative of the SCDOT, Michael Black, told The Island Packet and The Beaufort Gazette that Walmart was not allowed to work on the intersection until the state could verify that Walmart had permission from property owners to build the median. Walmart was allowed to pave the roads Aug. 16 due to safety concerns but was not allowed to continue any other construction. Josh Gruber, the deputy county administrator, said last week that Walmart needs a signal at that intersection in order for the stores to be approved by the county and for the retailer to receive a certificate of occupancy. If Walmart doesn’t receive the certificate, customers would be barred from entering the stores, though Gruber said he would be surprised if that happened. Walmart admitted to building the median in a statement on Aug. 12, two weeks after the installation of the median. So far, three car wrecks have been reported in that area after the median was built.

Aug 26, 2016 — by Brian Mann (Adirondack Bureau Chief) , in Newcomb, NY North Country Public Radio was able to confirm significant parts of Alvin Codner's account of two racial incidents in the Adirondacks this summer. The Florida man was visiting the Park for the first time when he was called the N-word and threatened. Photo: Brian Mann Listen to this story Aug 26, 2016 — Today we're tackling another complicated, thorny question about race: Are African American tourists and other people of color really welcome in the North Country? Our region is one of rural America’s biggest tourist destinations. From the Adirondacks to the Thousand Islands, millions of people come to our small towns every year. But the overwhelming majority of those visitors are white and some critics — and even some experts inside the tourism industry — say people of color don't always feel welcome or safe here. The conversation was sparked in part by a series of troubling racial incidents that happened in the Adirondacks this summer. Alvin Codner's story Alvin Codner, age 26, was working at a camp in the Adirondacks as a sports instructor. He’s from Florida and this was his first trip to the Park. On his off day, he and some friends went to Lake George, one of the North Country’s most popular destinations, stopping to eat at Duffy's, a tavern and restaurant on Amherst Street popular with tourists. Sierra Club president Aaron Mair spoke at a diversity conference in Newcomb. Also pictured, Alvin Codner (center) and Peter Nelson (left) with the Adirondack Diversity Advisory Council, one of the organizers of the gathering. Photo: Brian MannCodner said trouble started right away, that he and other people of color in the group were asked repeatedly for their IDs and then were confronted by the bouncer. "He said I know how you guys like your fried chicken, your orange soda, watermelon, Kool-Aid, and white girls," Codner recounted. The encounter escalated and Codner’s group was told to leave Duffy’s. A couple of weeks later, there was a second incident. He and a mixed-race group of friends were at the Wal-Mart in Ticonderoga when they were confronted by a white man using racial slurs. "The white guy said, Hey n——-, I want to see you outside. Hey n——-, I want to see all three of you n—— and look how you look," Codner said. An experience no one should ever go through DONATE NCPR is made possible by donations from visitors like you. Click to donate today. Before we talk more broadly about what these incidents might say about the experience of people of color visiting the North Country, it’s important to say that North Country Public Radio was able to verify significant parts of Codner’s story.  A Wal-Mart spokeswoman confirmed that Codner and his friends were accosted by a white man using racial slurs and the incident was unprovoked. "The experience Mr. Codner had with another shopper in our store is something no one should ever go through," said Wal-Mart's Leslee Wright.   So much to do in the North Country. So why are nearly 90% of the visitors white? Photo: Brian MannIn some ways, the story at Duffy’s in Lake George is more complicated. Co-owner Linda Duffy said her business is welcoming, that she’s comfortable with diversity.  "There are different races in our family," she said.  Duffy said the dispute with Codner’s group began as an argument over the bill. But she acknowledged that the exchange between Codner’s group and her bouncer may have turned racial. "If he had said anything [racial] to them, I don't know," Duffy said. "If he did, I apologize. He no longer works for us." Ugly incidents, a wider problem The proprietor of the business [was] telling N-word jokes from the time we entered to the time we exited the buildingIf these were one-off incidents, affecting one group of people of color, it would be troubling and ugly. But tourism industry experts say they don’t think Alvin Codner’s experience was unique.    Kim Rielly, director of communications for ROOST, one of the North Country’s biggest tourism marketing groups based in Lake Placid, is white, but she said she had an experience this summer in an Adirondack tourism business that left her troubled. "The proprietor of the business [was] telling N-word jokes from the time we entered to the time we exited the building. That was surprising and certainly off-putting." According to Rielly, concerns about racial sensitivity are serious enough in the Adirondacks that she’s careful when planning press and media junkets for ROOST’s marketing campaigns. "Sometimes those media are black [people] and I put their itineraries together. There are simply some places we won't add to that itinerary because we're not confident they'll have a positive experience," she said. The first step:  Making people of color feel safe ROOST, the Lake Placid-based regional marketing organization, has included mixed-race couples and people of color, as well as members of the LGBT community in advertising and marketing efforts. Photo: Provided by ROOSTThe experiences of Alvin Codner and his friends in Lake George and Ticonderoga have spurred a new conversation about how the region’s tourism businesses can be more welcoming, more open. Earlier this month, a coalition of groups held a diversity conference in Newcomb in Essex County.  One of the speakers was Aaron Mair, president of the Sierra Club, the first African American to hold that post. He said that the incident at Wal-Mart was particularly troubling. "A racial assault happens and not one person thinks to call the cops?" Mair noted. Wal-Mart’s spokeswoman acknowledged to North Country Public Radio that while one of their employees “broke up” the encounter, no one called police. She also confirmed that the white man who threatened Codner’s group wasn’t asked to leave the store. Mair said that decision was unacceptable and sent a dangerous signal. "Either this place is safe for children and people of color to be or it isn't," he said. Bigotry is bad business Lake Placid is one of America's most popular small town tourism destinations. Visitorship here is slightly more diverse than the rest of the North Country, but nearly 80% of the tourists are still white. Photo: Brian MannAt the Newcomb gathering, people talked about the racial divide in the North Country’s visitor experience in two ways. First, the existence of raw bigotry. "There are people who are going to be blatantly racist," said Peter Nelson with the Adirondack Diversity Advisory Council. "There will also be people like that." Nelson said his group can’t solve racism per se, but it can focus on the second issue: helping businesses and other organizations in our largely white small towns respond better.  "The way that businesses deal or don't deal with these kinds of issues. The way they do or don't have competence with issues of diversity and people of different backgrounds and cultures and colors. That [shortcoming] is ubiquitous throughout the Park," he said.    In part, this is a story about fairness, about openness, but it’s also a story about business. Tourism is a huge part of the North Country’s economy. Jim McKenna, head of the tourism marketing group ROOST, said people of color will soon make up nearly half of potential visitors. A lot of local companies just aren’t ready. "I think that some of the larger businesses, they treat [people of color] as a normal customer, no matter what their ethnic background is," McKenna said. But he acknowledged that "that's not prevalent throughout the Park." He said his organization is working to remind tourism businesses that making black, Hispanic and Asian visitors is a "dollars and cents" issue that will shape their bottom line going forward. But the region has a long way to go. Last year, a study found that 90% of visitors to the Adirondack Park were white.   Care to comment on this story?

Published on August 26, 2016. Target associates pitched in to help victims of the Louisiana floods. Credit: Target Most Popular Following historic floods in Louisiana, several marketers are pumping up their relief efforts. Brands including Target, Walmart, Starbucks and Tide have all contributed in recent days. Earlier this month, epic rainfall flooded the area with over 6.9 trillion gallons of water. Minneapolis, Minn.-based Target, which has six stores and over 1,000 staffers in the Baton Rouge area and other affected areas, has pitched in with volunteers and distribution of water and giftcards to local nonprofits. The retailer has also donated $100,000 each to the Salvation Army and American Red Cross. Related Stories National TV 'News' Scores an Epic Fail for an Epic Flood in Louisiana Similarly, Bentonville, Ark.-based Walmart announced recently that its foundation will be giving $1 million to various nonprofits including the Greater Baton Rouge Food Bank in support. In total, the retail chain is committing $1.5 million for food and supplies. "We have been working closely with nonprofit partners, first responders, elected officials and governmental organizations to learn how we can use our strengths to help," said Kathleen McLaughlin, president of the Walmart Foundation, in a statement. Last week, Tide, which is owned by Procter & Gamble, sent its Loads of Hope truck to Baton Rouge in order to collect, wash and dry laundry free of charge for victims affected by the floods. P&G also handed out cleaning products including Mr. Clean and Swiffer. Duracell has also sent its truck with batteries and a charging station. Starbucks donated $100,000 to the American Red Cross, the coffee chain said recently. The brand encouraged customers and employees to text "LAFLOODS" to 90999 in order to donate $10 to the relief fund. Some brands have taken their efforts in an atypical direction. Pizza Hut, for example, started a GoFundMe page asking for contributions to help staffers affected by the tragedy. The restaurant chain, which is owned by $13.1 billion Yum Brands, has received nearly $8,000 of its $25,000 funding goal thus far. In addition, the Ad Council and GSD&M recently unveiled a black-and-white ad, "Our Turn," in response to the disaster, which is the country's worst since 2012's Hurricane Katrina. The film, which includes a voiceover from Matthew McConaughey, directs viewers to OurTurntoHelp.org.

"A lot of shoppers know Walmart is a great place to save money on everyday necessities like groceries," said Mark Mazza, CEO and co-founder of PromoCodeWatch.com. "But there are many more deals to be gotten at Walmart than just [those on] everyday items." Mazza went on to highlight some of the top items on which shoppers can save money, including furniture, televisions, and more. In an effort to help you score the best deals at Walmart, GOBankingRates reached out to some of the best and brightest shopping minds in the business, as well as a Walmart insider. Click through to find out what they said. This article was originally published by GOBankingRates. 6 steps to become a recovering spender A (nearly) foolproof way to hit your savings goals Crucial questions to ask when you're deep in debt 1. Simple Furniture Getty Images Walmart's in-house brand of furniture, Simple Furniture, offers a line of quality home furnishings at prices that are hard to beat. "In most cases, Walmart is consistently cheaper, with similar quality to IKEA, on desks, bookcases, entertainment centers and the like," said Kyle James, founder of Rather-Be-Shopping.com. 2. Mainstays futons Walmart.com Good for a college dorm or even a home office, Walmart futons are both comfortable and affordable. According to a Walmart's spokesperson, customers can score Mainstays futons online or in the stores for just $98 each. Research reveals that most of the chain's competitors charge more than $100 for the same models. 3. Televisions PAUL J. RICHARDS/AFP/Getty Images If you're looking to score an HDTV without blowing your budget, Walmart could have the solution. "Over the last year, about 20 percent of our Editors' Choice deals from Walmart were for TVs," said Benjamin Glaser, features editor with DealNews. "Of those deals, Walmart really slashes prices on off-brand HDTVs, like VIZIO, Sceptre and Element, which are often hundreds of dollars cheaper than name-brand equivalents." Glaser added that customers seeking higher-quality brands can still save money, as Walmart offers regular deals on Panasonic, Samsung and LG TVs. 4. Legos iStockphoto When it comes to toy purchases, Walmart has a habit of besting its competition. Both James of Rather-Be-Shopping and Howard Schaffer of Offers.com noted that Lego sets at Walmart are generally cheaper than those available from competing toy retailers, such as Toys "R" Us, Target and Amazon. "This is especially true when you get into your more expensive Lego sets, like Minecraft, Ghostbusters and Marvel Super Heroes," said James. 5. Sewing and craft supplies Getty Images/iStockphoto If you're looking for a hobby that keeps you or the kids off the computer, you might want to stop by your local Walmart. "Sewing supplies, fabric, ribbon, yarn and craft supplies are far cheaper at Walmart than at a craft or fabric store like Beverly's," said Teri Gault, a shopping expert and author of "Shop Smart, Save More." "Plus, Walmart has an ample selection to choose from." 6. LED desk lamps Getty Images/iStockphoto Let there be light for a lesser price. Walmart sells Mainstays LED desk lamps for as low as $5.87, according to the Walmart spokesperson. Considering that comparable lamps tend to cost $20 at other retailers, the spokesperson singled out this deal as one of the best the chain store has to offer. 7. Brand-name laundry detergent Getty Images/iStockphoto Multiple shopping experts agree that brand-name laundry detergent is consistently one of the best Walmart deals. "125-ounce Tide Original Scent Liquid Laundry detergent from Target is 12.9 cents per ounce, compared to 10.8 cents per ounce from Walmart," said Kendal Perez of Coupon Sherpa. Alicia DeMartini of BeFrugal echoed the sentiment, adding that other brick-and-mortar and online retailers usually can't beat Walmart's prices. 8. Starbucks coffee iStockphoto Even products by brand names as big as Starbucks can be found for cheaper prices at Walmart. "Coffee is a steal from Walmart," said Perez. "A 20-ounce bag of Starbucks Dark Caffè Verona Ground Coffee is priced at $11.98 (60 cents per ounce), compared to $8.19 for a 12-ounce bag from Target (68 cents per ounce) or $12.95 for a 16-ounce bag from Starbucks (81 cents per ounce)." 9. Wines Torsten Schon/Getty Images/iStockphoto There are plenty of generic brands that can save you money, and Walmart's store-brand wine gives the competition a run for its money. "Everyone knows about Trader Joe's two buck chuck, which is now $3. Walmart's Oak Leaf is comparable to TJ's [but available] for less," said Gault. Prices vary from store to store, but Walmart Oak Leaf wine usually goes for $2.29 per bottle, and wine experts have given it the thumbs up for its quality. 10. Organic foods Getty Images/iStockphoto Recently, Walmart made its first foray into the organic food market, and the customer reception has been positive. James and Perez have both observed that Walmart offers competitive prices on organic food products, even compared to organic supply staples like Sprouts Farmers Market. "For example, a 12-ounce jar of Justin's Almond Butter is priced at $8.97 at Walmart, compared to over $11 from Sprouts," said Perez. Walmart deals on organic foods also beat out more direct competitors, such as Target. "Crisco Pure Organic Coconut Oil is priced at $6.99 at Walmart, compared to Target's non-organic Crisco Coconut Oil for the sale price of $6.93," Perez said.

Kaya Yurieff Aug 25, 2016 1:12 PM EDT Updated from 11:13 AM EDT. NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- Shares of Dollar Tree (DLTR) and Dollar General (DG) were tumbling in midday trading on Thursday after both discount retailers reported weak quarterly results. Dollar General also reiterated its full-year guidance for earnings per share falling between 10% and 15%. "I thought that was interesting that they reiterated given the fact that how really kind of subpar it was," TheStreet's Jim Cramer said of the quarter on CNBC's "Squawk on the Street" this morning. Cramer added that the discount retailer also cited "unseasonably mild spring weather." "What does that mean, you bought less Velveeta?" Cramer wondered. "No one else cited the unseasonably mild spring weather of the companies that I deal with...I thought that was curious. It raised eyebrows." Dollar Tree and Dollar General posted "very disappointing" numbers, Cramer added in the above video, saying that if consumers are feeling better they tend not to shop at dollar stores. Additionally, Cramer said that dollar discount retailers are being pressured by Walmart Stores (WMT). Walmart CEO Doug McMillon "is upending the whole retail world. Walmart is driving some everyday low prices like they did in the old days when they put out of business a lot of companies," Cramer noted. The retail giant has raised wages for workers so they do not go to a competitor. The company has also made it so that consumers are "very conscious" that it has cut prices, according to Cramer. Walmart is "livelier. They kept the employees for once," Cramer stated. Prev 0 of 2 Next If you liked this article you might like Can You Find a Bargain Among Discount Retailers Now?

(DG), St. Jude Medical, Inc. (STJ) and Express Scripts Holding Company (ESRX) Are 3 of Today’s Worst Stocks DG, ESRX and STJ stock used more than their fair share of red ink on Thursday By James Brumley, InvestorPlace Feature Writer  |  Aug 25, 2016, 4:43 pm EST     Popular Posts: 5 Stocks to Buy for a Big January 7 Stocks That Won’t Be Around a Year From Now Why Twilio Inc (TWLO), Humana Inc (HUM) and Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Are 3 of Today’s Worst Stocks Recent Posts: Why Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc (REGN), Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd ADR (TEVA) and AT&T Inc. (T) Are 3 of Today’s Worst Stocks Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO) Stock Is More Attractive Than You Think Micron Technology, Inc. (MU) Stock Is Screaming Buy … On Any Dip View All Posts Without any good news to distract them from the fact that stocks are technically overbought and fundamentally overvalued, investors tested the bearish waters again today. And this time, they took a bigger bite. The S&P 500‘s close of 2,172.47 was 0.14% below Wednesday’s close, but more than that, pulled the index under a key support line near 2,175. It was even worse for owners of Dollar General Corp. (NYSE:DG), Express Scripts Holding Company (NASDAQ:ESRX) and St. Jude Medical, Inc. (NYSE:STJ) though. Here’s why these three names were hit as hard as they were. Dollar General Corp. (DG) Deep discount chain Dollar General undeniably had to do whatever it had to do to compete with drastic price cuts from giant rival Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT). Problem is, the price war has taken a much bigger fiscal toll on Dollar General — and now DG shares — than it ever will on Wal-Mart. The bad news: In its second quarter of the year, Dollar General earned $1.08 per share on $5.39 billion worth of revenue. Both were better than the year-ago comparisons when the retailer earned 95 cents per share of DG on sales of $5.10 billion. The pros, however, were expecting a profit of $1.09 per share and sales of $5.5 billion. 7 of the Worst Stocks on Wall Street Buckingham Research commented in the big miss, “The laundry list of reasons for the sales slowdown is also not particularly reassuring.” DG shares ended the day down 17%, while close-cousin Dollar Tree, Inc. (NASDAQ:DLTR) fell 10% after investors assumed the two are suffering a similar fate. Express Scripts Holding Company (ESRX) It may have only been a victim of circumstance, but it was a victim nonetheless. Express Scripts Holding shares fell 6% after Mylan NV (NASDAQ:MYL) announced it would be lowering the price of its EpiPen, which can be used to treat dangerous allergic reactions. The matter was put front and center this week when the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairperson Chuck Grassley asked Mylan CEO Heather Bresch to explain the more-than-400% price hike for the EpiPen in less than a decade. Recognizing there was no good answer, Mylan acquiesced and cut the price of the EpiPen by nearly half. The lower price is also a big blow to Express Scripts Holding Company, which enjoyed a steep markup on the devices it sold to consumers. Rival CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS) is also vulnerable to the EpiPen price cut, sending CVS shares lower by more than 3%. St. Jude Medical, Inc. (STJ) Finally, it remains to be seen if the accusations are true or not, but St. Jude Medical investors weren’t taking any chances. STJ stock tumbled 5% on Thursday following reports that research firm Muddy Waters’ Carson Block cautioned the company’s medical devices have a major security flaw. Specifically, Block warned that St. Jude Medical’s Merlin@home remote monitoring devices don’t make secure connections with the patient’s monitoring service. St. Jude Medical denies the allegation, responding that its equipment uses several security protocols. It’s also worth noting that Muddy Waters has a history of making strong, publicized accusations including of companies he may be holding a short position in. In those cases, Block could profit from their stock’s pullback. Interestingly, Muddy Waters’ claim materialized just before Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) was to complete the acquisition of St. Jude Medical. The claim could prompt Abbott to back out of the deal, which would send STJ shares plummeting. As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obituaries E-Edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds log in Site Archive Walmart, Kroger, and Dollar General are fighting in a war  and that's great news for shoppers Thursday Aug 25, 2016 at 3:33 PM Hayley Peterson Thomson Reuters Competition is heating up between America's biggest grocery chains, and food prices are falling as a result. Dollar General said Thursday that it's cutting prices on hundreds of items across 2,000 stores as it battles slowing sales growth. "These price reductions are meaningful and recognizable," Dollar General CEO Todd Vasos said in an earnings call. "These are the items that will actually drive additional foot traffic into our stores." The strategy follows in the footsteps of Kroger, Trader Joe's, and Walmart, which have also been slashing prices this year. Kroger recently lowered the cost of 1,000 popular grocery items in 120 of its stores, retail consultant David Merrefield writes on industry website The Robin Report. It's also in the process of hiring 14,000 people at its 2,800 stores to boost customer service.  Prior to Kroger's cuts, Trader Joe's quietly dropped its prices and Walmart revealed it was reducing prices on hundreds of items in its grocery department with a particular focus on fresh produce, consumables, and over-the-counter drugs.  Walmart's price cuts are part of a multi-year, multi-billion-dollar investment that Walmart launched in the first quarter of the year.  The grocery price wars are curiously cropping up at the same time that German discount grocer Aldi expands its footprint in the US.  Aldi has about 1,500 stores in the US with plans to open 500 more stores over the next two years as part of a $3 billion expansion. Aldi and rival discounter Lidl have upended the grocery market in the UK in recent years, forcing the nation's largest supermarkets to dramatically cut prices and lay off workers to stay competitive. The CEO of Asda, the UK's second-largest grocery chain, has called the new competitive environment created by Aldi and Lidl "the worst storm in retail history." "When we set the plan, I don't think anyone anticipated the market being in meltdown," Asda CEO Andy Clarke said last year after the Walmart-owned company reported its worst quarterly sales drop ever. In a price check last year, Business Insider found Aldi's prices were roughly 30% lower than Walmart's. Aldi and Lidl are both planning rapid expansions in the US.

Daniel B. Kline (TMFDankline) Aug 25, 2016 at 4:23PM Image Source: Getty. Costco (NASDAQ:COST) not only has tremendous customer loyalty. It also has a reputation for being a good employer. While retail rivals like Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) and Target (NYSE:TGT) have suffered through protests over employee wages, Costco has managed to avoid that negative press. That's because the chain has made an effort to be good to its employees, aggressively keeping its wages ahead of industry averages. That pays off in multiple ways for the warehouse club. Higher wages can obviously help attract and retain employees while also encouraging better service for customers. Wal-Mart CFO Brett Biggs even noted during his company's most-recent earnings call that happier workers have partly been responsible for sales increases in the chain's United States stores. We believe a contributing factor to the results is our consistent improvement in customer experience. Customer surveys indicate that we're making good progress in providing a better shopping experience with cleaner stores, faster checkout and friendlier service. Higher-paid workers are happier workers, and while this simple idea perpetually eludes some retailers, Costco has long understood it. Costco has a reputation for being a good employer. Image source: author. Costco has been a wage leader While Wal-Mart and Target deserve credit for their recent large-scale wage increases, Costco has always been a leader when it comes to hourly salaries. The company continued to protect that turf in the first three quarters of its fiscal 2016 by raising hourly rates at both the top and the bottom of its wage scale. CEO Richard Galanti discussed this during the company's third-quarter earnings call.  As I mentioned, our last quarter's -- second quarter's earnings conference call back in March, in addition to the...top of scale increase each year...this year, we also increased our bottom of scale hourly rates in U.S. and Canada, which is about 80% of our company. Effective this past March 14, we increased our starting wage at $1.50 an hour to $13 and $13.50 an hour. Making a change like that does not come cheaply, and Galanti explained the cost during the call. The new bottom of scale wage increase results in a year-over-year incremental payroll expense of about $6 million, or $0.01 a share in the quarter. We estimate that this will be anywhere from $0.01 to $0.02 a quarter in each of the next three quarters depending on which way it rounds. To put the numbers into perspective, Costco's minimum hourly rate is now $13 an hour, while Wal-Mart's average full-time hourly wage is $13.38 an hour, while its average part-time hourly wage is $10.58 an hour, according to Zacks.com. (It's also worth noting that both companies offer health benefits, retirement plans, employee discounts, and other perks with real financial value that are not part of their hourly wages). Costco is playing smart defense Paying workers a little more than your rivals keeps those employees from leaving. That lessens training costs, improves morale, and creates a better overall environment. Satisfied workers directly translate into better sales, as they do a better job taking care of customers. And employees who are in it for the the long haul -- rather than those who are biding their time until they find a better job -- take more pride in their work. In the grand scheme of things, the difference between being a wage leader and skimping on wages is a relatively small number for Costco. By choosing to pay that price long before employees become unhappy with their wages, the company has made a smart move that should continue to pay off for years to come.

Aug 25, 2016 Is a granola bar 'natural' if there's pesticide in it? The latest debate over "natural" isn't about one specific food ingredient in a product; it's about a pesticide. A series of lawsuits filed by three consumer groups say that Nature Valley granola bars are deceptively advertised as "made with 100% natural whole grain oats" because the bars were found to contain small amounts of the controversial synthetic pesticide glyphosate.

For once, Amazon is taking a page from Walmart's playbook Planning documents filed in three West Coast areas and reported by local news organizations suggest that Amazon is bringing brick and mortar into its online grocery business. The top-secret operation is reportedly a "click and collect" model where customers can order groceries online and pick them up at a nearby location, instead of paying hefty delivery fees to have their purchases delivered to their homes. This model seems to have worked well for other retailers including Walmart, which Quartz reports now has grocery pickup services at more than 400 stores. Read more at Quartz...

On Wednesday, a trader bought 20,000 September 72.50-strike calls for 89 cents, or $89 per options contract. Since each call option accounts for 100 shares of stock, this is a $1.78 million bet that Wal-Mart will rally at least 2 percent in the next few weeks. The hefty trade came amidst an eventful day in the options pit for Wal-Mart, which saw 2.5 times the average daily call volume for its stock. While Dan Nathan of RiskReversal.com is also bullish on Wal-Mart, he does see a potential trouble spot for the retail giant in the next few months. Last October, Wal-Mart's shares tanked following their annual analyst meeting where the company revealed that it expected profits to drop as much as 12 percent in the next year. This year's meeting will be held on October 6, and all eyes will be on Wal-Mart to see if this year will be a repeat. But Nathan believes that traders can actually factor in the analyst meeting, and that the retailer is still a solid bet. "[Wal-Mart is] up 18 percent, that's nearly double the performance of the XRT in 2016," he said Wednesday on CNBC's "Fast Money." "[If] you're looking for possibly some more volatility in the broad market, or potentially as you head into their analyst meeting, you may want to define your risk." "I wouldn't be looking at September, I'd be looking out and I want to capture that analyst meeting and possibly their earnings that are going to happen in mid-November," Nathan added. Wal-Mart is currently down about 2.5 percent this quarter to date.

(Reuters/Rick Wilking) Share Written by Alison Griswold August 25, 2016 Amazon appears to be planning to let US customers order groceries online and pick them up at designated drive-in spots, according to planning documents reviewed by several local news outlets. The e-commerce giant is reportedly testing a “click and collect” model in Sunnyvale, California, a little further up the San Francisco peninsula in San Carlos, and in Seattle, Washington. Online grocery is a notoriously tough business and even Amazon has struggled to crack it. With the drive-in model, Amazon is taking a page from an unlikely player in the space: Walmart. Walmart began testing curbside pickup of online grocery orders for the US in Denver in 2013. This time last year, online grocery pickup was available in five US markets; it has since expanded to nearly 400 stores across more than 60 markets. Pickup is same-day, free for customers, and available from 7am to 11pm local time. Curbside pickup has worked well for Walmart, which has a ready-made storage and distribution network in its more than 4,000 US stores. The service is convenient for customers—Walmart says it takes less than five minutes to drive up and have groceries placed in your car. At no additional cost, it also likely appeals to Walmart’s core shoppers, who tend to be in the mid- or lower-income brackets. “That value proposition is something that has resonated really strongly with our customers,” says Ravi Jariwala, a Walmart spokesman. By having shoppers pick up their groceries at the store, Walmart also eliminates most of the expensive and complicated logistics that have burdened other delivery companies, and which often end up getting passed along to the customer. Instacart, an online grocery startup valued at $2 billion, charges as much as $11.99 for each of its deliveries. Amazon has focused its online grocery efforts thus far on Amazon Fresh, a same- and next-day grocery delivery service it introduced in 2007. Fresh is a competitor to FreshDirect and Peapod, two established US grocery delivery services, as well as startups like Instacart. But nearly a decade after its launch, Fresh is only available in a handful of US cities. And at $299 a year it remains an expensive add-on to Amazon’s flagship Prime membership. Walmart doesn’t break out numbers on its grocery business but Neil Ashe, the company’s outgoing head of global e-commerce, said in June that he expected the grocery segment to contribute “hundreds of basis points” to the US over time. For the quarter ending on July 29, Walmart CEO Doug McMillon pointed to “the continued roll out of online grocery and growth of pick-up in stores” as a key driver of Walmart’s 11.8% increase in e-commerce sales. “We wouldn’t be expanding this as quickly as we have—going from five to now well over 60 [markets], with a view to even further expansion this year—if we weren’t encouraged by the response we were seeing from customers,” Jariwala says. Amazon did not respond to requests for comment. Read full story home our picks popular latest obsessions search

(AP Photo/Jeff Chiu) The Associated Press A month after Wal-Mart introduced online grocery ordering with curbside pickup at five stores in the St. Louis area, the discount retailer is expanding the service to more stores in the region. The Walmart Supercenter at 2608 Green Mount Commons Drive in Belleville will begin offering curbside pickup Sept. 6. Walmart Supercenter at 2700 Ridge Point Drive in High Ridge and a new smaller-format Walmart Neighborhood Market at 45 Sutters Mill Road in St. Peters will add the service Sept. 19. Wal-Mart introduced its online ordering service with same-day curbside pickup about a year-and-a-half ago but didn’t begin offering it in the St. Louis region until last month, starting with stores in Festus, Collinsville, Arnold, Lake Saint Louis and Washington, Mo. With the free service, customers order and pay online, pull up to specially marked parking spaces on the side of the store and a Walmart employee loads the merchandise into their vehicle. There’s a minimum $30 purchase and only a portion of the retailers’ goods are available for curbside pickup, about 30,000 items. Available merchandise also includes lightbulbs and other goods from throughout the store. +1  Walmart's curbside pickup parking spots at its Arnold store on Aug. 25, 2016, are highlighted with orange signage.

Nicholas Rossolillo (nrossolillo) Aug 25, 2016 at 12:47PM Image source: Wal-Mart. Retail giant Wal-Mart Stores (NYSE:WMT) reported second-quarter earnings last week and had lots of details for investors to digest. Besides the health of the giant itself, what have we learned from the company's report? 1. Sales growth is stalling (outside of internet sales) Wal-Mart and other traditional retailers have been struggling against internet retail. July's retail sales report showed e-commerce grew by 14% year over year, a trend that has been in force for years now. By comparison, general merchandise stores saw a mere 0.2% year-over-year growth, with department stores showing a 3.9% contraction. Such is the case for Wal-Mart, posting just a 0.5% increase in revenue last quarter. However, Wal-Mart did have solid growth from certain areas, like its new neighborhood market concept. Comparative sales at the small-format grocery-centric stores were up 6.5%, a positive sign that convenient locations and quicker access to shopping could be a winning strategy with consumers. Comparative sales for Wal-Mart as a whole were 1.6%. Other brick-and-mortar retailers have begun to experiment with smaller formats in an attempt to win back market share. Department store chain Kohl's (NYSE: KSS), for example, is rolling out smaller-footprint locations and small specialty stores to see if they gain traction with digitally minded and time-strapped consumers. But don't bet on physical stores being the answer. Wal-Mart is reporting success with its neighborhood market concept, but internet sales growth remains the focus. Revenue generated from the online store is still a small share of the company's total business, even though e-commerce sales were up 11.8% in the quarter. The company has stated numerous times its focus is on fostering growth in that segment, backing those statements up with the recent purchase of online shopper jet.com. Other traditional retailers, and investors in them, should therefore take heed. Growth can still be eked out of physical store formats, but the key to long-term growth lies with internet selling. 2. Retail stocks look like a bargain Wal-Mart's latest quarter was ultimately pretty lackluster, posting flat top-line growth as the retailer struggles to find the answer to fight changing consumer shopping habits. However, the stock popped the day of the earnings release anyway. In an environment where retail has been struggling, any good news whatsoever is refreshing for investors. Throughout second-quarter earnings season, many other retailers have noted difficulties with the business of selling merchandise. Wal-Mart's big-box rival Target (NYSE: TGT) stated discounting was and will continue to be a necessity to keep customers coming in. Even with this situation being the case, Wal-Mart's  report was enough to lift shares as much as 3% the day of the report. The earnings release showed flat sales growth and 8.6% growth in profits coming from falling cost of sales and the sale of the Yihaodian business in China. With the one-time sale item having a big impact on quarterly profits, the report really was just meh. WMT Price data by YCharts. With all of the downbeat news many retailers have endured in the last year, many stocks in the industry look like a bargain. I think Wal-Mart has demonstrated it's time for investors to start researching retailers with an eye for making a purchase. 3. Traffic and comp growth is key Cost-cutting can only carry profit growth so far. Cost of sales during the quarter dropped 0.6% year-over-year, but what Wal-Mart and other merchants really need is traffic and comparable-sales growth to keep up with internet retailers. Wal-Mart in the U.S. posted growth during the quarter in each measure of 1.6% and 1.2%, respectively. This growth came mostly from the aforementioned neighborhood market and e-sales figures, offsetting declines at Wal-Mart's supercenters. The positive momentum is a good sign, but the company will have to do better to stave off Amazon. As mentioned before, Wal-Mart's e-commerce efforts yielded an 11.8% growth rate. But with e-commerce in general averaging 14% growth, the company actually ends up losing market share to the competition. If foot traffic declines can't be offset more aggressively with neighborhood markets and e-commerce, the company will continue to be stagnant. This situation is being mirrored at other retailers. Developing an omnichannel sales model, one that incorporates online and physical store sales, is proving difficult for some big-box and department stores. Investors, if your merchandiser is suffering from this problem, it's time to take a look at other stocks that are having greater success. 4. The pain of being a multinational organization Since the summer of 2014, the U.S. dollar has gained in value against most other global currencies. This situation is weighing on profits of U.S.-based multinational corporations, Wal-Mart included. ^DBLUSD data by YCharts. When Wal-Mart sells goods in another country, it collects payment in that country's currency. When the company brings the proceeds back to U.S., it has to convert them  to dollars. If the dollar has strengthened against the other country, the value of the money collected drops. Because of this situation, Wal-Mart and other businesses that operate in multiple countries have seen profits affected. For the retail titan, revenue was negatively impacted by $2.7 billion dollars in the quarter, representing a 2.2% hit on the top line. It has been a tough two-year stretch for big corporations dealing with currency issues, but some respite might be in store with the recent pullback in the dollar. Even with the recent decline, though, the dollar is riding high. Nicholas Rossolillo owns shares of Target. The Motley Fool has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Thank you! August 25, 2016/0 Comments/in 2016, Columns, Week of August 25 /by Website Editor by Debbie Walker Please bear with me and yet another local article about the lock down at Wal-Mart in the Newport/Palmyra store on Friday, August 19. My big thank yous to the Maine state troopers, local sheriff’s department, Newport police, Wal-Mart staff and management, Dunkin’ Donuts staff, first responders and anyone that I may have left out of this. With all the craziness in this world today it was wonderful that the whole situation was taken care of with no shots fired. They were able to talk to a distressed, armed man and bring everything to an end, and send the man off for the help he obviously needed. My friend Kathy and I went in to Wal-mart just before 10 a.m., we were in there for four things. Got right in there, found the things we wanted and were ready to head out. We were headed for the cashiers when a man said, “No need to hurry ladies, we are now on lock down”. Lock down!!!!! You’re kidding, but looking at the people milling around the doors told us he was telling the truth. Soooo, what to do, so we walked around and the cart grew from four things to a cart load! Someone made the crack that maybe this was Wal-mart’s new marketing plan! I saw a man coming down an aisle with a flat loaded with chairs, didn’t take long to figure out this was going to be a while. So we went to Dunkin’ Donuts for some lunch. They were doing their part of passing out goodies to folks, too. Most everyone we saw seemed to be trying to make the best out of a bad situation. You have to know no one planned on all that time in there. The staff went around with a cart with water and crackers. Someone else was passing out crayons and paper to the children. How people handle others in strange situations is always of interest to me. I was quite impressed with all the professionalism of all involved. “Bless his heart,” there was one man in there that had left his dog in the car for a short trip into the store. Needless to say three hours later he is upset. It was towards the end of the ordeal the troopers took him out to bring in the dog and got him water. Kathy and I were feeling bad because that could have been us. Every other day last week we had Toby, her dachshund, with us. Guess we learned an important lesson. Sometimes things just don’t go as planned. And believe it or not, after spending three hours in Wal-mart on Friday, I still have to go back to do our real grocery shopping. However, I think I will head for Waterville this week. I’m just curious if we ever show people our true gratitude. Contact me at dwdaffy@yahoo.com. Sub line: Thank you. Thank you and looking forward to hearing from you!

News Forget The Amazon Effect; The Wal-Mart Effect Hits Dollar Stores Dollar Tree and Dollar General are suffering from more price competition, including from retail giant Wal-Mart. (Michael Rivera) BILL PETERS 8/25/2016 Reprints Dollar General (DG) and Dollar Tree (DLTR) on Thursday said increased competition, lower grocery prices and other difficulties weighed on their second-quarter results, which for both companies missed Wall Street's expectations. The results come as Wal-Mart (WMT) starts to cut its own prices, potentially luring away customers who might otherwise head to smaller dollar stores strategically placed within the orbit of big-box Wal-Mart locations. Meanwhile, Amazon (AMZN) has been ravaging clothing retailers and is making more inroads in groceries. "Retail food deflation ... coupled with unseasonably mild spring weather, proved to be stronger than expected headwinds to our business," Dollar General CEO Todd Vasos said in a statement. "The competitive environment also intensified in select regions of the country." Dollar Tree CEO Bob Sasser, meanwhile, cited a continued "challenging retail sales environment" in the company's second-quarter earnings release. Variations on that phrase -- "challenging environment" -- have become a common refrain this earnings season amid heightened concerns about economic security and personal safety. Shares of Dollar General dived 17.6% to 75.61 in the stock market today, dropping below their 200-day average and falling out of buy range. Dollar Tree sank 9.9% to 85.50. Technically, that's back in buy range from a prior breakout, but the high-volume gap down through the 50-day line is a clear sell signal. Wal-Mart dipped 1.4% to its lowest close since June 20 -- just two days after hitting a 14-month intraday high. Amazon ticked up 0.3%. Dollar Tree cut its full-year net sales forecast to $20.69 billion-$20.87 billion from an earlier outlook of $20.79 billion-$21.08 billion. Analysts expected $21.02 billion. However, Dollar Tree raised its full-year earnings-per-share guidance to $3.67-$3.82 from $3.58-$3.80. Analysts forecast $3.79. IBD's TAKE: Cheaper groceries also pose a competitive threat to the restaurant business, potentially forcing restaurants to cut costs. See this story on Middleby, which makes equipment for restaurant kitchens, for more on how restaurants try to contain expenses.  Dollar General stuck to its full-year EPS forecast, but said it expected capital expenditures during the year to rise after purchasing 42 Walmart Express stores — Wal-Mart's small-store model that the dollar stores effectively killed. The dollar stores benefit from a smaller-store model, which can be easier to navigate for shoppers seeking to buy only a few items and helps keep labor costs down. But Wal-Mart has stepped up its e-commerce efforts, and its price cuts could force the dollar stores into a downward spiral of discounts to compete more aggressively with each other. "As we spoke to store managers about price competition in March of this year, almost none cited any issues or changes in activity from competitors," Jefferies analyst Daniel Binder said in a research note earlier this month. "However, as we went through spring and summer, the responses around increased pricing activity spiked up enough to get our attention. Walmart was often mentioned as the culprit, but we also heard store managers call out direct competition in the dollar store channel."

Best Buy reported better-than-expected numbers this past week and the stock spiked as short-term sentiment improved. While this certainly is a ray of sunshine for this beleaguered retail stock, Best Buy in the long-run, will not be able to overcome the headwinds of agile competitors with lower cost structures. Toys R Us, a dominant brand, was crushed by the online presence of distributors combined with the scale of Wal-Mart. Egghead Software made a proactive decision to eliminate brick-and-mortar stores and move towards online sales. Circuit City, Good Guys and CompUSA all were crushed as margins compressed based on increasing online competition. Best Buy was the beneficiary of the problems that each of these companies faced which allowed it to carve off significant brick-and-mortar market share. Still, despite market gains, there is no disputing the erosion of profit that occurs when just-in-time delivery web access solutions provide the same product at lower cost. Even Wal-Mart, with its purchase of Jet.com, recognizes that in order to compete with Amazon and other online retailers, it must have a significant presence in the online space. This is Walmart we are talking about which has the most scale of virtually any company in the United States and even THEY needed to take drastic action to blunt the impact of online stores. Best Buy is a popular choice when you wish to test out an item, see it live and in person, need it same day, and are looking for some degree of human interaction. But despite the brick-and-mortar advantage, how many times have you noticed someone at Best Buy on their smart phone looking to see whether or not Best Buy is charging the lowest price? And given that Best Buy has a price match guarantee for any web retailer, doesn't it make sense that their margins will be crushed given they have much higher overhead costs then online retailers? There are 4 basic reasons Best Buy faces major headwinds despite its valiant efforts to remain relevant in today's web-enabled marketplace: Margin compression: As Best Buy matches prices and attempts to be competitive with a higher cost structure, there is simply no way it can stem the erosion of profit as online retailers have a significantly leaner cost structure. Service revenue won't fix the problem: The service business promoted by Best Buy is a higher profit center enterprise but we do not see its potential to be significant enough to offset the erosion of profit margins as it continues to operate as a brick-and-mortar chain. Online retailers are moving downstream: Online competitors are beginning to develop brick-and-mortar solutions for product delivery. Amazon, for example, already has a network of delivery lockers for consumers looking for same-day delivery, purchasers of products without permanent addresses, buyers of goods traveling out of town. Online will be the core with modified brick-and-mortar solutions available to compete on a local basis. This is a much different cost structure than brick-and-mortar as the core and online as an add on. Same-day delivery services will continue to increase as Amazon and other online retailers work to increase the efficiency of their distribution network. Already in some communities Amazon offers same-day delivery. We expect an increase in delivery efficiency through the use of logistics and other technology solutions. This is not to say that Best Buy is ultimately moving in the direction of Good Guys or Circuit City; there needs to be a competitor in the marketplace for those wishing to touch and feel a device prior to purchase. But as a lesson to be learned, investors should look and see what happened to the book space: Borders is out of business and Barnes & Noble has been closing stores. There is no reason to believe that Best Buy will avoid the same fate that bookstores fell prey to over the course of the last 10 years. I'm not saying Best Buy will declare bankruptcy but it's going to have a smaller footprint with less retail impact. One last thought to consider. When Webvan emerged in the spring of 1999, pundits talked about grocery as the next great conquest for online sales. Obviously with the demise of Webvan that turned out not to be the case as consumers wanted to touch and feel the product. But I would contend that buying groceries is far different than buying a computer. The book seller comparison is much more appropriate. The stock investment game is really one of time horizon. On the short-term there were some positive signs for Best Buy and that is why the stock popped. But if one looks below the surface to look at trend lines and the oncoming march of online retailers towards becoming the alternative to brick-and-mortar solutions, it's hard to see why Best Buy should be a part of one's core long-term portfolio strategy. The competition is fierce and the world is moving online. While there will be a need for a smaller scale Best Buy footprint, the future for this company will likely look much different that today's current market position. The reasonable inevitable conclusion for this company will be that this enterprise will be smaller and less profitable; I just don't see any other outcome. Commentary by Michael A.

Welspun has been caught in a maelstrom after U.S. retailing giant Target last week accused the Indian manufacturer of passing off cheap sheets as premium Egyptian cotton for two years. Target has said it is severing ties with the company, prompting other Welspun clients including Wal-Mart Stores and JC Penney to also probe the manufacturer. Welspun shares fell 10 percent at the open on Thursday, and hit the daily lower limit for a fourth day. At Thursday's low, Welspun had a market value of Rs 5,355 crore ($798 million), nearly half the market value it had last Friday. The stock recovered to trade largely flat by midday on Thursday after Welspun sent a clarification to exchanges reiterating that an external audit of the supply chain has been sought and would be completed in 6-8 weeks. Bed Bath probe Bed Bath & Beyond spokeswoman Leah Drill said the retailer will pursue an investigation and take appropriate action. The company's announcement came after Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, said it is reviewing Welspun's cotton certification records. Department store JC Penney is also conducting an investigation "to ensure the integrity of Welspun's product claims." Macy's said on Wednesday it is also monitoring the situation. Target on Wednesday said it is in the process of taking out all products made by Welspun under the 'Fieldcrest' label, and has already removed 750,000 Fieldcrest bedding products from stores and its website. Those were sold between 2014 and 2016, and Welspun claimed they were made from Egyptian cotton, spokeswoman Molly Snyder said. The investigation at Target, which routinely audits its products, finished at the end of July, Snyder said. She declined to provide details about what triggered the probe. Target declined to comment on how this product quality issue was not caught by its internal buying team for two years. also see AgustaWestland scam: CBI to focus on top politicians Sheena Bora murder case: CBI maligning my image, says Peter Mukerjea TMC workers demonstrate outside CBI office against Sudip Bandyopadhyay's arrest Target is offering a refund, in the form of a gift card, to affected customers, who either have a loyalty card or bought the products online. On Monday, Welspun said it would hire a major accounting firm to review its supply processes. Some retailers such as Swedish home furnishing giant IKEA AB said they would continue doing business with Welspun while awaiting the outcome of the firm's probe.

"A lot of shoppers know Walmart is a great place to save money on everyday necessities like groceries," said Mark Mazza, CEO and co-founder of PromoCodeWatch.com. "But there are many more deals to be gotten at Walmart than just [those on] everyday items." Mazza went on to highlight some of the top items on which shoppers can save money, including furniture, televisions, toys and electronics. In an effort to help you score the best deals at Walmart, GOBankingRates reached out to some of the best and brightest shopping minds in the business, as well as a Walmart insider. Click through to find out what they said. 1. Mainstays Futons Good for a college dorm or even a home office, Walmart futons are both comfortable and affordable. According to a Walmart's spokesperson, customers can score Mainstays futons online or in the stores for just $98 each. Research reveals that most of the chain's competitors charge more than $100 for the same models. 2. Televisions If you’re looking to score an HDTV without blowing your budget, Walmart could have the solution. “Over the last year, about 20 percent of our Editors' Choice deals from Walmart were for TVs,” said Benjamin Glaser, features editor with DealNews. “Of those deals, Walmart really slashes prices on off-brand HDTVs, like VIZIO, Sceptre and Element, which are often hundreds of dollars cheaper than name-brand equivalents." Glaser added that customers seeking higher-quality brands can still save money, as Walmart offers regular deals on Panasonic, Samsung and LG TVs. 3. Legos When it comes to toy purchases, Walmart has a habit of besting its competition. Both James of Rather-Be-Shopping and Howard Schaffer of Offers.com noted that Lego sets at Walmart are generally cheaper than those available from competing toy retailers, such as Toys "R" Us, Target and Amazon. “This is especially true when you get into your more expensive Lego sets, like Minecraft, Ghostbusters and Marvel Super Heroes,” said James. 4. Sewing and Craft Supplies If you’re looking for a hobby that keeps you or the kids off the computer, you might want to stop by your local Walmart. “Sewing supplies, fabric, ribbon, yarn and craft supplies are far cheaper at Walmart than at a craft or fabric store like Beverly's," said Teri Gault, a shopping expert and author of "Shop Smart, Save More." "Plus, Walmart has an ample selection to choose from.” 5. LED Desk Lamps Let there be light for a lesser price. Walmart sells Mainstays LED desk lamps for as low as $5.87, according to the Walmart spokesperson. Considering that comparable lamps tend to cost $20 at other retailers, the spokesperson singled out this deal as one of the best the chain store has to offer. 6. Brand-Name Laundry Detergent Multiple shopping experts agree that brand-name laundry detergent is consistently one of the best Walmart deals. “125-ounce Tide Original Scent Liquid Laundry detergent from Target is 12.9 cents per ounce, compared to 10.8 cents per ounce from Walmart,” said Kendal Perez of Coupon Sherpa. Alicia DeMartini of BeFrugal echoed the sentiment, adding that other brick-and-mortar and online retailers usually can’t beat Walmart’s prices. 7. Starbucks Coffee Even products by brand names as big as Starbucks can be found for cheaper prices at Walmart. “Coffee is a steal from Walmart,” said Perez. “A 20-ounce bag of Starbucks Dark Caffè Verona Ground Coffee is priced at $11.98 (60 cents per ounce), compared to $8.19 for a 12-ounce bag from Target (68 cents per ounce) or $12.95 for a 16-ounce bag from Starbucks (81 cents per ounce).” Related: 5 Best and Worst Deals at Starbucks 8. Wines There are plenty of generic brands that can save you money, and Walmart's store-brand wine gives the competition a run for its money. “Everyone knows about Trader Joe's two buck chuck, which is now $3. Walmart's Oak Leaf is comparable to TJ's [but available] for less,” said Gault. Prices vary from store to store, but Walmart Oak Leaf wine usually goes for $2.29 per bottle, and wine experts have given it the thumbs up for its quality. 9. Organic Foods Recently, Walmart made its first foray into the organic food market, and the customer reception has been positive. James and Perez have both observed that Walmart offers competitive prices on organic food products, even compared to organic supply staples like Sprouts Farmers Market. “For example, a 12-ounce jar of Justin’s Almond Butter is priced at $8.97 at Walmart, compared to over $11 from Sprouts,” said Perez. Walmart deals on organic foods also beat out more direct competitors, such as Target. “Crisco Pure Organic Coconut Oil is priced at $6.99 at Walmart, compared to Target’s non-organic Crisco Coconut Oil for the sale price of $6.93,” Perez said. 10. Organic Kids Foods Walmart’s organic food savings extend to snacks and treats for the kids. “Ella’s Kitchen Organic Nibbly Fingers baby food is priced at $3.98 from Walmart, compared to $4.09 from Target," said Perez. "Honest Kids Super Fruit Punch Organic Juice is priced at $2.98 from Walmart, compared to $3.14 from Target. Horizon Organic Low-Fat Chocolate Milk is $7.59 from Target, compared to $6.42 from Walmart." 11. Photos For people who still prefer to print out their photos, Walmart offers great low rates that beat out the competition. “You can get 4-inch-by-6-inch photos for 9 cents apiece at Walmart," said James, who went on to note that Shutterfly charges 15 cents, Walgreens charges 12 cents and Target charges 15 cents on average. 12. Beauty Products Want to pay less for your favorite beauty products? Perez said Walmart deals on beauty products, such as makeup, nail polish and personal care items, are tough for competitors to beat. “For example, a CoverGirl LashBlast Super Sizer Mascara is currently priced at $7.49 from Walgreens, compared to $5.94 from my local Walmart,” she said. Perez also singled out shampoo and eye shadow as top Walmart deals. Cosmetics chain Ulta has Pssssst! Dry Shampoo currently on sale for $5.99, while Walmart regularly charges just $5.47 for the same item. “I buy Almay eye shadow from Walmart, too," said Perez. "The Almay Intense I-Color Everyday Neutrals is priced at $4.97 from Walmart, compared to $6.39 from Target and $8.49 from Walgreens." 13. Cleaning Products Walmart offers affordable prices on both name-brand and house-brand cleaning products. “I buy Mule Team Borax from Walmart, priced at $3.97 for 4 pounds. That’s compared to $4.09 from Target or $8.99 from Walgreens," said Perez, adding that Walmart’s Great Value bleach beat Target’s price for its equivalent up & up brand bleach. Perez also prefers Walmart for brand-name cleaners. “Clorox All Purpose Cleaner with Bleach Spray (32 ounces) is priced at $2.88 from my local Walmart, compared to $2.94 from Target and $4.49 from Walgreens,” she said. 14. Kitchen Appliances Both Glaser and James reported that Walmart often posts incredible deals on kitchen items, from simple cookware to heavier equipment like mixers and waffle makers. “I was really surprised to find that Walmart sold the KitchenAid 4.5-Quart Stand Mixer for $35 less than Bed Bath & Beyond,” said James. “At first, I thought it might be an inferior model but, after some investigative work, it turned out to be the same product.” 15. DVDs and Blu-rays Walmart makes keeping up with the latest movies and TV shows a little easier on your pocketbook. “One of the most popular deals posted in the FatWallet Hot Deals forum is for Walmart Blu-rays or DVDs,” said Brent Shelton of FatWallet. “Walmart has some of the best pricing, if not the best, on current and popular movies and TV series.” Walmart DVDs and Blu-rays often include exclusives, such as extra footage and behind-the-scenes features, said Shelton. Additionally, Walmart offers InstaWatch on select items, allowing purchasers to watch content within 24 hours on any device they choose. 16. School Supplies If the kids are heading back to school, you might want to consider hitting up Walmart's office supplies department. The Walmart spokesperson said the retailer offers some of the best deals on school supplies, such as folders, spiral and composition notebooks and even Crayola Crayons. While Walmart does go big with its back-to-school sales, customers should keep a sharp eye on the price tags. “Look for the cardboard seasonal displays that are full of loss leaders on school supplies, like binders, pencils, composition books, crayons, markers and backpacks,” said James. “They're so cheap, they are clearly losing money on them, hoping you'll buy stuff at full price, too. Don't fall for the trick…only shop the screaming deals and ignore the rest.” 17. Laptops and Tablets Whether you’re shopping for your college student or seeking a new computer for yourself, Walmart has laptops and tablets to fit your taste and wallet. According to the spokesperson, Walmart has slashed prices on multiple computer products. The Acer Chromebook currently costs $179, down from $199; the HP Manhattan Gold laptop costs $539, down from $599; the iPad Mini 2 costs $229, down from $269; and an iPad Pro 9.7-inch 32GB is presently priced at $584. 18. Back-to-School Apparel Walmart is also the perfect place to buy your back-to-school clothing. Apparel favorites such as School Uniform Polos, Girls’ Faded Glory Leggings and Boys' Fruit of the Loom short-sleeve basic tees all cost less than $5 each at Walmart. And school uniform pants are under $10. 19. Baby and Toddler Clothing Children grow out of their clothes quickly, a fact that can put a serious burden on your budget. Fortunately, Walmart offers some of the cheapest apparel around for fast-growing babies and toddlers. Said Shelton, “This makes sense for the family budget when buying back-to-school apparel for pre-school and elementary kids who often go through clothing quickly, whether they wear them out or grow out of them. And the young are often not concerned with sporting popular brands, which can cost hundreds of dollars more when shopping for school.” 20. Brand-Name Toiletries Walmart once again comes to the rescue with affordable, brand-name grooming products. “My husband uses Arm & Hammer AdvanceWhite toothpaste, and we can purchase a two-pack from Walmart for $5.98, or $1 per ounce. That’s compared to $3.49 per tube from Target,” said Perez. Additionally, customers can score sweet-smelling deals on deodorant. “A twin pack of Secret Invisible Solid Antiperspirant is available for $3.97 from Walmart, compared to $3.49 for a single deodorant from Walgreens or $6.88 for the same twin pack on Amazon,” she said. “Even Walgreens’ promotion of 'buy one, get one half off' on this product doesn’t compete with Walmart’s regular price for two products.” 21. Disposable Razors James knows first-hand how convenient the savings are that Walmart offers on disposable razors. "I've been buying my Schick disposable razors at Walmart for years and pay 20 percent to 30 percent less than at Target or Amazon," he said. Schaffer echoed this claim, noting that razors at Walmart can be up to 50 percent off what they are in drugstores. 22. Sunscreen Walmart protects your bank account and your skin. Both name-brand sunscreens and Walmart's own brand, Equate, can be found at the chain for cheaper prices than competitors offer, said DeMartini. 23. Office Supplies and Stationery Office supplies and stationery are great buys at Walmart, especially for those purchasing custom wedding invitations through Walmart Stationery. "[Walmart Stationery] is, perhaps, the easiest and fastest way to create your own invites for weddings for under 99 cents per piece," said Shelton. The FatWallet pro added that Walmart serves up passport photos, greeting cards and baby announcements from 28 cents each. 24. Women’s Active Wear It might come as a surprise to clothing aficionados, but Walmart offers great deals on women's active wear. The Walmart spokesperson singled out Avia and Danskin brands as some of the top bargains available at Walmart. From sports bras to vintage-style hoodies, V-neck shirts to leggings, Walmart stocks quality women's athletic apparel for around $15 per item.

Sales increased 8.7% to R42bn. Weaker economic growth and the effect of the weaker rand on the price of imports “severely constrained consumers’ discretionary spending on durable goods,” the company said. Food and liquor sales growth accelerated with factors including and lower pricing than competitors, it said. South African retailers have wrestled this year with challenges including weak domestic consumer confidence and rising interest rates, as economic growth stalls. "We anticipate that this situation will make trading for the remainder of 2016 difficult," Massmart said. Wal-Mart, based in Bentonville, Arkansas and the world’s largest retailer, bought a controlling stake in Massmart in 2011 to take advantage of African growth.

Events Close ESTHER CEPEDA: One person's clutter could be another person's treasure Aug 25, 2016 (…) CHICAGO -- In a recent op-ed piece, Stephanie Land characterized the de-cluttering craze, popularized by Marie Kondo's best-selling "The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up," as a form of class-based scorn. "In a new documentary about the movement, 'bad' consumption is portrayed by masses of people swarming into big-box stores on Black Friday, rushing over one another for the best deals," wrote Land, a fellow at the Center for Community Change, in The New York Times. "They are, we're led to understand, slaves to material goods, whereas the people who stay away from mass consumption are independent thinkers, free to enjoy the higher planes of life. But those people flocking to Wal-Mart ... are people teetering on or even below the poverty level, desperate for comfort in their homes. To point to them as a reason to start an anti-consumerism movement is just another form of social shaming." I agree -- there's a lot of hype tinged with snobbery. The minimalism movement has become what Kyle Chayka calls "Silicon Valley's version of Zen monkhood." Writing in The New York Times Magazine, Chayka nailed Land's discomfort: "Minimalism is now conflated with self-optimization. ... The movement, such as it is, is led in large part by a group of men who gleefully ditch their possessions as if to disavow the advantages by which they obtained them. But it takes a lot to be minimalist: social capital, a safety net and access to the internet." Still, as someone who lives in an area where the Wal-Mart is only a mile from the local Goodwill thrift store, I have a very different take on it: Kondo's approach may be a conceit of the upper class, but it has undoubtedly enriched the lives of all the working-class people who are lucky enough to live near high-quality second-hand-goods stores. From the perspective of someone who has been going to Goodwill every Saturday morning since my local store opened in 2011, Kondo's "Life-Changing Magic" has brought a lot of high-priced glee to a neighborhood whose poverty rate reached almost 21 percent in the years after the Great Recession. What this means for a low-income family with school-aged children is that when back-to-school time comes around, a mom can usually find new, often-times very high-quality name-brand clothes and shoes -- plus extremely cheap, practically new school supplies like scissors, loose-leaf notebook paper, folders, rulers and required paperbacks like "To Kill a Mockingbird" or "The Great Gatsby" -- for pennies on the dollar. These families then take the savings from having purchased donated goods down the street to Wal-Mart for the licensed-cartoon-character brand lunchboxes, backpacks and other supplies the kids simply can't do without for the start of school.

The Salvation Army, for instance, funds adult rehabilitation centers and programs that help people re-enter society and attain gainful employment in part through profits from the donated goods that are resold in their thrift stores. According to Charlene Sarmiento, the public relations program manager at Goodwill Industries International, people's donations help fund programs that educate and train veterans and military families, older workers and others entering the job market. The stores and associated programs provide real work experience and career counseling, computer classes, resume reviews, job interview training and specialized industry education to get people into jobs in their communities. Last year, Sarmiento said, "Goodwill placed 312,000 people in employment in the U.S. and Canada and nearly 2 million people worked to build their career and financial assets by engaging with Goodwill team members. In addition, more than 35 million people used computers and mobile devices to access Goodwill education, training, mentoring and online learning services to strengthen their skills." Sarmiento could not make a direct connection between the Kondo craze, which started after the book was published in the United States in 2014, and Goodwill's 4 to 7 percent increase in donations over the past two years but said, "We know that Kondo's book has been very popular and we encourage people who are de-cluttering to donate the items they no longer need to Goodwill. ... Many of our friends, family members and neighbors have been able to find jobs and care for their families through your donations to Goodwill." De-cluttering doesn't have to be a vapid exercise in conspicuous austerity. Clean house and help others at the same time by donating to your local nonprofit thrift store.

Appeals court upholds Walmart EIR; project can move forward By Jill Barnes Nelson, Tehachapi News Aug 24, 2016 City of Tehachapi An artist's rendition of the proposed Tehachapi Walmart. Walmart once again looks to be a go in Tehachapi. The Fifth District Court of Appeal in Fresno announced Wednesday afternoon, Aug. 24, that the City of Tehachapi has adequately addressed environmental issues related to the project. The vote of the three-panel judge was unanimous.  A hearing on the matter was held July 26 and it was widely expected the decision would take about a month to come down from the court.  “It’s our understanding the City and Walmart have prevailed in the appeals court,” City Manager Greg Garrett said just after the decision became public. “The appeal process is not yet completed but we’re happy that this long legal back and forth may soon be over.” Mayor Susan Wiggins also was happy the appeal process could be at an end. “I’m really happy to hear this,” Wiggins said by phone. “I listened to both sides and also from 350 senior citizens who said they needed the Walmart. They said didn’t want to drive to Bakersfield any more to get lower prices on the things they need. I’m glad to hear that this is over, unless they can appeal again.” The drive to stop the Walmart project had been brought before the court twice in the past by a group called Tehachapi First, which cited environmental concerns. The last time Tehachapi First went to court was in July 2015 after Kern County Superior Court Judge Kenneth Twisselman ruled that the City of Tehachapi had adequately addressed environmental concerns related to the project. Tehachapi First emerged as an organization after the city approved Walmart in 2011. Through its attorney, Mark Wolfe of San Francisco, the organization has challenged the adequacy of environmental reviews related to the proposed Walmart. If allowed to move forward, the 165,000-square-foot Walmart super center would be built on property the company owns near the southeast corner of Tucker Road and Tehachapi Boulevard. Tehachapi First initially appealed the Tehachapi Planning Commission’s approval of the Walmart project in January 2011. The latest report from the court hearing said the city will recover all its costs for the appeal.

Like other big companies before it, including Walmart and Google, Apple recently received a federal designation for its energy subsidiary that allows it to become a wholesale seller of electricity from coast to coast. In effect, Apple is creating its own green utility company, although the main customer is itself. The motives may be economic as much as they are environmental. As a wholesaler, Apple could reduce the cost of its electricity load, which reached 831 million kilowatt-hours in the last fiscal year — enough to power about 76,000 homes for a year. But like a growing number of corporations, Apple is intent on reducing carbon dioxide emissions from electricity production — one of the biggest sources of greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming. In one ambitious venture, Apple has contracted with First Solar to begin buying a little less than half of the power later this year from California Flats, a solar energy farm now under construction. Under the terms of the deal, Apple will pay $848 million for the electricity over 25 years and receive the farm’s total output by the end of the agreement. It is one of largest commercial clean energy contracts yet. Lisa Jackson, the former administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency who is now the Apple executive overseeing environmental policy, social initiatives and worldwide government affairs, said she hopes Apple will serve as a model for the many other big corporate power users that are now embracing clean energy. “This is just another sort of innovative way to get that power onto the grid so we don’t have to take the California grid-mix default, which still includes fossil fuel,” Jackson said. Although much of Apple’s manufacturing is done offshore, it still has extensive needs for electric power in the United States — and not only for the sprawling corporate complex it is building at its headquarters in Cupertino, and its 270 retail stores around the country. One of Apple’s biggest demands for electricity comes from operating the computing cloud through which it sells apps, music and videos to users of its iPhones, iPads and Mac computers. Apple’s move comes as prices for renewable energy continue to plummet. And signing long-term contracts allows businesses to shield themselves from potentially higher, more volatile charges from a power company. Apple would not say how much it is paying for California Flats’ energy, but Jackson said last year at a Wall Street Journal conference that it is less than what it paid for commercial power. She said she expects the company to save hundreds of millions of dollars over the life of the contract. Google, which received its federal energy wholesale designation from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in 2010, is a big proponent of the approach Apple is now taking. “Running any kind of business, having predictability in terms of your operating costs can be very important,” said Gary Demasi, director of operations for data center energy and location strategy at Google, which has been a leading investor in and user of clean energy. “Renewable energy, from a cost perspective, is now competitive with other forms of energy, much more so than it was a few years ago.” In the United States, the generating capacity of corporate clean energy projects has more than doubled each year since 2013, according to the Business Renewables Center at the Rocky Mountain Institute, which tracks publicly announced deals. In 2015, 11 companies signed up for 3.23 gigawatts’ worth of projects, roughly the equivalent of five coal plants and up from 1.18 gigawatts the year before. Executives face greater pressure from shareholders and customers to show that they are doing their part to fight climate change. At the same time, corporate energy use has exploded, driven in many cases by the ravenous demands of the data cloud. “We are all becoming very large energy players, and this is a shift,” said Brian Janous, director of energy strategy at Microsoft. “Energy is not something that Microsoft or Amazon or Google really ever had to think much about prior to the advent of the cloud.” Helping drive that shift are environmental groups like the World Resources Institute. In May, it helped create the Renewable Energy Buyers Alliance, a coalition of nonprofits that has more than 60 corporations in its network, including McDonald’s and General Motors, as well as Google and Walmart. Electric utilities have begun to respond by creating services to meet the corporate demand for clean energy, said Letha Tawney, the World Resources Institute’s director of utility innovation. One is a green tariff. It was pioneered in North Carolina by Duke Energy and is now under consideration in about a dozen states. It allows companies to designate that they are paying for a renewable energy supply. Another is a synthetic or virtual power purchase agreement, under which companies contract to buy the output of a clean power plant, as Apple is doing with California Flats. Although the companies say these arrangements mean they are running their businesses on renewable energy, in reality the clean power often does not flow directly to their facilities. They typically buy the renewable energy in amounts to match what they draw from the grid — a system of swaps that Jackson of Apple likened to using an ATM. “The dollar you deposit in the bank might not be the exact same bill that you get out,” she said. Robert F. Shapiro, a partner at the law firm Chadbourne & Parke who focuses on project finance and energy, describes it as meaningful symbolism. “They’re actually getting power from their local utility, which may be coal,” Shapiro said. “But they’re deemed to have put into the world carbon-neutral energy, which they are deemed to have used for their load.” To keep track of the clean energy credits, power generators work with registries to issue numbered certificates. “The power flows into the grid. The electrons go where they go,” Tawney said. “But because there’s a renewable-energy certificate, no one else can claim the same zero-carbon benefit.” Such complexities are necessary, executives and clean energy advocates say, because it is not often feasible to install enough renewable-power generators at corporate sites to meet companies’ full energy needs. Walmart, despite having installed solar panels, wind turbines and fuel cells at stores and distribution centers, can nonetheless meet only about a third of those operations’ energy needs. So it also buys renewable energy from generators and utilities, said David Ozment, director of energy at Walmart stores. At Apple, where the purchase or production of renewable energy has more than tripled since 2012, the company would prefer to not have to go to great lengths to ensure a clean energy supply, Jackson said. But the public energy grid is simply still too dependent on carbon fuels to make that possible. “If we had our preference, we’d just be able to say, ‘We want 100 percent green power everywhere we use power,’” Jackson said. “The best would be if we could run every one of our stores, every one of our data centers, every office complex, every building we have, on 100 percent renewable — and if we didn’t have to spend a whole bunch of our time and energy figuring out how to get that done.” Latest from the SFGATE homepage: Click below for the top news from around the Bay Area and beyond.

Matthew Zinner, 17, of Conway is charged with attempted murder in connection with the incident, according to an Horry County police arrest warrant. At about 11:50 p.m. on Aug. 17, Zinner met with the 18-year-old male victim in the Wal-Mart parking lot at 151 Middle Ridge to sell him an unknown amount of marijuana, an arrest warrant states. The victim gave Zinner two counterfeit $100 bills, and Zinner got out of a vehicle and chased after the victim with a handgun and fired two shots at him, the warrant states. One shot struck the victim, and he feared for his life, according to the warrant. Horry County police met with the store manager when they arrived and the manager told authorities they thought someone was shooting in the parking lot, a report states. Officers found an abandoned hat and shoes and went to the hospital after hearing a gunshot victim had come in, police said. The victim told authorities he was shot while at Wal-Mart and left his shoes and hat behind during the incident, according to the report. Zinner was arrested Thursday and released later that day on $25,000 bond, according to J. Reuben Long Detention Center.

The world's largest retailer also raised its fiscal-year profit forecast, sending its shares up 1.5 percent. For the second quarter in a row, the company bucked a string of weak results from higher-end brick-and-mortar competitors like Target Corp, Macy's Inc, and Kohls Corp. Target cut its fiscal-year profit outlook on Wednesday after quarterly sales fell more than expected. Wal-Mart U.S. Chief Executive Officer Greg Foran said on a conference call that the company's customers were still cautious with their spending but were visiting stores more often and buying more items. Store visits increased 1.2 percent, and the average size of an order rose 0.4 percent during the second quarter ended on July 31. "We are seeing a steady improvement in the U.S. business, and it is responding favorably to the changes we are making," he said. The Bentonville, Arkansas-based company said sales were strong for grocery items and apparel but weak for electronics. Wal-Mart has been spending heavily to get customers back. Earlier this year, it increased entry-level wages to $10 an hour and said it would invest $2.7 billion in employee compensation and training over two years, a move it says has led to cleaner stores, faster checkouts and better customer service. "Walmart's strategic investments are generating traction, which is especially meaningful, given a large portion of its customer base remains challenged," said Moody's analyst Charlie O'Shea. The retailer said it was difficult to quantify the effects of low gasoline prices and unseasonably warm weather, but those factors contributed to overall sales growth. Online sales growth accelerated sequentially for the first time in more than five quarters, rising 11.8 percent from 7 percent in the first quarter on the back of investments in technology and warehouses to fulfill those orders. Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs said e-commerce growth was stronger in the United States than in major overseas markets, mainly because of its larger third-party seller business and the continued roll-out of online grocery pickup options. Wal-Mart has added 7 million items on its website this year, bringing the total to 15 million. This compares with 200 million on online rival Amazon.com Inc. In hopes of accelerating its e-commerce business and narrowing the widening gap with Amazon, Wal-Mart is buying internet retailer Jet.com for more than $3 billion. The company raised its fiscal-year earnings outlook to between $4.15 and $4.35 a share, including an estimated hit of 5 cents from the Jet.com acquisition, from a previous range of $4.00 to $4.30. Second-quarter earnings per share of $1.07, excluding a gain from the sale of Wal-Mart's e-commerce business in China and other items, exceeded the analysts' average estimate by 5 cents. Sales at U.S. stores open at least a year rose 1.6 percent, excluding fuel prices, to beat expectations in their eighth straight quarter of growth. International sales fell 6.6 percent to $28.6 billion but increased 2.2 percent on a currency-neutral basis. Total revenue rose 0.5 percent to $120.9 billion.

Now that the worst of the downturn has come and gone, investors have one last chance to buy value dividend stock Royal Dutch Shell plc (ADR) (NYSE:RDS.A, NYSE:RDS.B) on the dip. It’s certainly unusual to call a stock that is currently generating negative net income a value stock. However, most stocks don’t have cash flows and profits tied so closely to the price of a commodity like oil. Like many oil and gas stocks, if crude oil prices stay below $50/bbl, RDS.B stock will struggle to make significant headway. But assuming oil prices continue a steady long-term rise, Royal Dutch Shell is sitting in an ideal position. In the years leading up to the collapse of the oil market, RDS.B spent heavily on exploration and production projects. In addition, the company recently closed a massive $50 billion buyout of BG Group plc (ADR) (OTCMKTS:BRGYY). 7 Best Dividend Stocks You Haven’t Heard Of The buyout certainly stretched Royal Dutch Shell’s balance sheet thinner than shareholders would ever want to see it stretched. However, if oil prices recover, RDS.B’s aggressive buying will work wonders for its cash flow for years to come. RDS.B Is a Hidden Value Stock Royal Dutch Shell’s new game plan is selling off non-core assets, cutting costs as much as possible and attempting to stay afloat. Management is prioritizing spending until the crude oil market is more cooperative. The company now says its priorities will be debt reduction, dividends, capital investments and share buybacks. Click to Enlarge The following Bloomberg graph shows just how much Shell’s net debt has ballooned in 2016. Yet, so far, the company has opted not to cut the dividend. In fact, Shell hasn’t cut its dividend in 70 years. That fact is a good indication of how committed management is to maintaining the dividend. In June, CEO Ben van Beurden provided an update on this strategy. “By capping our capital spending in the period to 2020, investing in compelling projects, driving down costs and selling non-core positions, we can reshape Shell into a more focused and more resilient company, with better returns and growing free cash flow per share,” van Beurden explained. Of course, these projections assume at least $60/bbl crude oil prices in the long-term. Wall Street’s Take on Shell Stock The company and its shareholders are understandably optimistic, but what do industry experts think of Shell stock? Just this week, Argus analyst Bill Selesky reiterated his “Buy” rating of RDS.B. He expects RDS.B stock to outperform Energy sector peers and the S&P 500 in coming quarters. The ratings agencies aren’t particularly concerned about Shell’s large debt load. Shell debt is still rated A/stable by Standard & Poor’s, Aa2/negative by Moody’s and AA-/negative by Fitch — all investment grade. Rackspace Hosting, Inc. (RAX) Jumps on Apollo Buyout However, Raymond James analyst Jean-Pierre Dmirdjian believes Royal Dutch Shell’s balance sheet could actually get worse before it gets better. Earlier this month, Dmirdjian questioned Shell’s ability to grow its free cash flow and continue to pay its dividend in the current “unsupportive oil price environment.” If Bank of America’s projections are correct, RDS.B could morph into one of the best long-term value stocks in the market by the middle of next year. Analyst Savita Subramanian is “Overweight” energy stocks and believes crude oil will hit $69/bbl by summer 2017. It seems clear that if oil prices rise, RDS.B stock could easily be one of the best value/dividend combos in the market. However, crude oil has proven to be volatile and unpredictable in the last two years. The market doesn’t seem to trust RDS.B stock just yet. But the window to buy the dip in Shell stock before the market re-gains its confidence may be closing. As of this writing, Wayne Duggan was long RDS.B.

(Thankstelfair) JAMES DETAR 8/26/2016 Reprints Big Lots (BIG) easily beat second-quarter profit estimates Friday morning, but shares quickly reversed lower amid ongoing concerns about retailers and discounters in particular. The report followed a steep sell-off in Dollar General (DG) and Dollar Tree (DLTR). The dollar stores missed Wall Street earnings targets, and Dollar General cut its full-year sales forecast amid intense competition, as Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) was preparing to slash prices, and as Amazon.com (AMZN) continued to expand its online retail footprint. Big Lots, which operates more than 1,400 closeout stores in 47 states, said Q2 earnings per share minus one-time items climbed 30% to 52 cents, easily topping estimates of 40 cents. It was the third quarter in a row of better-than-expected earnings. Revenue dipped slightly to $1.2 billion from $1.21 billion a year earlier, just missing projections for $1.216 billion. Comparable store sales edged up 0.3%. For Q3, Big Lots sees diluted EPS between a 4 cent loss and a 1 cent gain. Consensus is for a 1-cent loss. The company expects sales at stores open more than a year to be flat to up 2% vs. the same quarter a year earlier. For Q4, Big Lots sees adjusted EPS of $2.18-$2.23, with same-store sales flat to up 2%. Analysts had expected Q4 EPS of $2.21. Big Lots has seen weak revenue for more than two years, reporting growth in a range of minus 1% to plus 1% every quarter in that period. Its earnings growth, however, has mostly in double digits due to cost control measures. Big Lots opened higher on the stock market today, but it soon reversed and traded down 4.5% to 50.57 in very heavy volume, below the 50-day moving average. The stock fell 4.3% on Thursday, dropping below its 50-day line intraday but closing above that support area. Thursday's move did push Big Lots slightly below a 53.45 entry point cleared in late July. The high-volume selling below the 10-week line is a clear sell signal. IBD'S TAKE: Retail earnings and stocks have been uneven in recent weeks, with discounters no exception. But one specialty discounter has performed well since its July 2015 IPO and is setting up in a bullish consolidation. Check out this IBD Stock Analysis of Ollie's Bargain Outlet, which reports earnings next week. Dollar General fell 0.15% after closing down 17.6% Thursday. Dollar Tree ended flat after losing nearly 10% Thursday. Wal-Mart dipped 0.1% and Amazon advanced 1.3%.

Dollar stores such as Dollar Tree (DLTR) and Dollar General (DG) were hammered in response to their tepid fiscal second-quarter earnings and outlooks. All signs pointed to the following rare occurrence happening. Big-time deflation in consumable goods like milk, which has the effect of pulling down sales for companies that are expected to deliver huge sales gains. For some reason, Wall Street and the home gamers never seem to factor in inflation and deflation in their modeling and often get surprised when their large swings in either direction. Walmart (WMT) has been the price aggressor in the retail business year to date and has managed to rip off more than seven-straight quarters of traffic gains. These gains are coming at the expense of dollar stores. Food stamp reductions that began in April are a sales killer for dollar stores. Both of the main dollar stores continue down the road of mind-boggling new store opening/remodeling plans, which is creating inefficiencies in a business model that can't afford to have any. The million-dollar question today is whether to begin building positions in these once-high flyers. After all, they remain solid long-term growers, have good moats around their business and serve a critical function in society. I spent the night reviewing both quarters and earnings calls and came away less than enthused, for now, on the companies. Here are several key factors that should leave you on the sidelines. Pricing War I am in the process of doing a longer piece on this, but my general sense was that the discounters have entered a pre-holiday-season price war. Judging by the comments on pricing from Dollar General and Dollar Tree (and my knowledge of the situation at Walmart), each company has begun lowering prices on key food and household products in an effort to drive traffic. For example, Dollar General has dropped the price on 450 of its top-performing products across many of its stores. I think these new initiatives will come at the expense of margins for the balance of the year and that Wall Street is still underestimating the impact. Shout out to Walmart -- you finally have the dollar stores playing catch-up. Cannibalization Intensifies Dollar stores thrive on efficiencies in terms of store design (it's no frills, few employees on hand) and transportation. One way to create those efficiencies is to open stores right around the block from each other, which both dollar stores have done. But I think both of the companies are starting to run into a key problem from their pursuit of efficiencies by opening hundreds of stores over the past five years: cannibalization. In other words, the companies are no longer growing the market for their services, rather just shifting sales in the community among stores. This is a structural issue and one that Wall Street is probably not too keen on factoring into its forward outlook. But what it's likely to cause is slower sales growth and possibly lower returns on investment. Food Stamp Cut Let me provide some background on this because clearly investors were caught off guard. The thinking on the food stamp cuts that began in April was that increasingly, poor people would live at the dollar stores each week. That hasn't played out. Starting this year, unemployed food stamp applicants between 18 and 49 years old who are not disabled or raising minor children, will only qualify for the food stamp program for three months during a three-year period. So, those consumers who no longer qualify for the food stamp program lost their benefits April 1. The change impacted roughly 500,000 to 1 million people. As a result of this, dollar stores are seeing fewer visits to their stores -- if someone doesn't have any money, then they can't buy essentials. Moreover, when those affected visit the stores with whatever money they have, they are buying fewer items and skipping the higher-margin discretionary departments such as apparel. So, the dollar stores are being forced to drop their prices. I think this will remain a headwind for the sector this year. Perhaps next year its impact will die down as the labor market picks up (or so we hope) and these folks returning to paying jobs. But for now it's a structural impediment for the dollar stores.

As with many earnings seasons, some companies' EPSs exceeded estimates, but revenue fell shy of expectations. Some retailers offered a soft outlook, limiting stock movement. And, there were some companies like Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE: WMT) that delivered better-than-expected EPS and revenue. Although investors reacted to Wal-Mart's results positively, the stock gave away more than what it gained after the results. Related Link: The Market In 5 Minutes: Jackson Hole In Focus One of the possible reasons for investors' sentiments turning negative on such stocks could be the concern on store traffic, which hurt companies like Express, Inc. (NYSE: EXPR) in the second quarter. Despite a mixed bag of results, some of the retailers are still gaining considerably while others are on a losing streak. Let's look at the performance of five strong and five poor performs. 5 Poor Performers Express: Down over 25 percent on the week after reporting on August 24. Dollar General Corp. (NYSE: DG): Down 16.86 percent on the week after reporting on August 25. Dollar Tree, Inc. (NASDAQ: DLTR): Down 10.71 percent on the week after reporting on August 25. Signet Jewelers Ltd. (NYSE: SIG): Down 9.7 percent on the week after reporting on August 25. Target Corporation (NYSE: TGT): Down 6.58 since reporting on August 17. 5 Strong Performers Best Buy Co Inc (NYSE: BBY): Up 20.46 percent on the week after reporting on August 23. Urban Outfitters, Inc. (NASDAQ: URBN): Up 17.73 percent since reporting on August 16. Guess?, Inc. (NYSE: GES): Up 16.68 percent on the week after reporting on August 24. Foot Locker, Inc. (NYSE: FL): Up 9.42 percent since reporting on August 19. Dicks Sporting Goods Inc (NYSE: DKS): Up 6.96 percent since reporting on August 16. One indicator of the broader retail sector's performance, SPDR S&P Retail (ETF) (NYSE: XRT), is down 0.74 percent on the week, but up 0.93 percent over the month.

By John Seiler Former Editorial Writer at the Orange County Register Friday, August 26th, 2016 It passes strange that, after so many scandals, the Veterans Administration is a being held up as a model for prescription drug prices. But that’s just what Proposition 61 does. The Ballot Summary reads: “Prohibits state agencies from buying any prescription drug from a drug manufacturer at any price over the lowest price paid for the same drug by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, except as may be required by federal law.” I’m a U.S. Army veteran and sometimes use the VA. Right now it’s my only medical insurance. Although the care can be quite good, and I like the doctors and other medics I’ve worked with, the real problem is that it’s a big government bureaucracy that needs to be pushed, sometimes pushed hard, to get things done. That’s why John Cooper, a spokesman for Concerned Veterans for America, said in April, “The VA is still struggling with a lack of accountability, an inability to properly manage a budget rapidly approaching $200 billion, and a failure to provide veterans with timely access to care and benefits.” And is the VA the best model for low-cost prescriptions? For generic drugs, according to the VA’s site, “Prescriptions: 30-day or less supply for certain Veterans: $8. 30-day or less supply for higher income Veterans.” (Some veterans, such as those who are wounded or former POWs, receive all medical care free.) But for my two blood-pressure prescriptions, I pay $4 each at Walmart. Perhaps the difference in cost favors the VA for non-generic drugs. But for me, at least, and millions of other veterans, the private-sector is the way to save money. Of course, I realize Walmart offers its low price to get me to come into the store to buy mass quantities of the stuff on its shelves. But that is the point: The private sector finds ways to cut costs because it is competing. The government doesn’t. I wish the California Public Employees’ Retirement System would stay out of politics and just maximize its funds’ value. However, in this case Prop. 61 directly would affect CalPERS, according to its analysis: “As related to CalPERS, then, the Act would: Apply the VA price ceiling to programs where the state is the ultimate payer for a drug, which could include CalPERS even if CalPERS does not purchase the drug directly…. Require responsible state agencies, such as CalPERS, to enter into agreements with drug manufacturers for further price reductions so that the net cost of the drug, as determined by the California Department of Health Care Services (DHCS), is the same or less than the lowest price paid for the same drug by the VA.” And: “The Legislative Analyst’s Office, in its May 2016 report … indicated that the overall fiscal effect of the Act is ‘highly uncertain’ due to ‘uncertainty around (1) whether the lowest prices the VA pays for prescriptions drugs are publicly available and (2) how drug manufacturers would respond in the market if this measure were enacted.’” And: “The Act could cause pharmaceutical manufacturers to increase their VA prices instead of lowering the prices paid by California state purchasers such as Medi-Cal and CalPERS.” Sounds like higher costs and even more bureaucracy. And given that CalPERS has big financial problems, suffering its worst year of returns since 2009, any extra costs imposed by Prop. 61 ultimately would be withdrawn from taxpayers like an unneeded blood sample. The Yes on 61 campaign released a memo attacking CalPERS: “The analysis also underestimates the market power that CalPERS will have when negotiating drug prices pursuant to the measure…. [T]he analysis ignores crucial evidence from the pharmaceutical industry. The industry itself predicts that the measure would lower their profits and cause other states to pass similar legislation. Both of these outcomes would be exceedingly unlikely if this Act produces higher drug prices or reduced drug sales in California.” But how is “lower…profits” good for the drug industry? In a capitalist system, profits are used to fund research and development for new products, in this case wonder drugs to save us. (Granted, Big Pharma gets us hooked on too many of its potions and lobbies against alternative medicines and treatments; but that’s another matter.) The memo quotes the publication Pharma Exec from Dec. 16, 2015, with “emphasis added”: “If the voters of California approve this proposition it would establish an incredibly deep, mandatory discount – in essence a ‘price control’ – for the public purchase of prescription drugs in America’s largest state.” Price controls? How’s that working in Venezuela? From the days of Emperor Diocletian’s Edict on Maximum Prices in 301 in ancient Rome until today, price controls always cause scarcity and misery. The Yes on 61 campaign does highlight the problem of expensive medications. But the solution there is to reduce, not increase, government controls on medications. My longtime Register colleague the late Alan Bock used to urge that the FDA insist only that drugs be safe, not efficacious. Efficacy would be left to the determination of doctor and patient. Such a change would drastically cut the cost of developing new drugs. And Obamacare, the risibly named Affordable Care Act, has forced premiums to rise faster than the thermometer under the tongue of someone with a bad fever. All of this – Prop. 61, Obamacare, the inevitable Hillarycare II – is intended to push us into a single-payer, government-run system like they have in Canada, Venezuela or Cuba. If that’s the case, I might as well move to Cuba for the cheap stogies. Longtime California commentator John Seiler’s email: writejohnseiler@gmail.com.

"Following" : "Follow"}} August 26, 2016 8:41am   Comments Share: Related WMT December Price Changes At Wal-Mart Fast Money Traders Share Their Trump Picks: Ford, General Motors, Kansas City Southern Old Retail Gasps, As Foreign Online Retailers Rally (Investor's Business Daily) Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE: WMT)'s turnaround story appears to be playing out as planned, and the company is well positioned for continued growth, especially in the domestic business. However, with a lot of the focus on the domestic business, many investors may be ignoring Wal-Mart's international problems, especially in the United Kingdom where its grocery store, Asda, accounted for 8 percent of Wal-Mart's total sales in 2014. As noted by Bloomberg Gadfly's Chris Hughes, Wal-Mart bought the U.K.-based supermarket in 1999 for roughly $9 billion. Today, its same-store sales have plunged to nearly negative 8 percent compared to nearly 4 percent position in the first quarter of 2013. While Wal-Mart has a reputation of delivering low prices to consumer, in Europe, the German-based discounted no-frills supermarket chain Aldi and Lidl hold that reputation, and consumers are flocking towards the German brands. Related Link: Wal-Mart's Turnaround Story May Be The Real Deal Asda has tried to fight back, but it is losing a price war, not only against the German chains, but against the U.K.'s other large chains, J Sainsbury, WM Morrison Supermarkets and Tesco. So Now What Wal-Mart hired a new CEO, Sean Clarke, to oversee Asda and his priority is to increase market share rather than protecting profit. A sale of the company to a private equity firm that offers Wal-Mart a quick out from the market is "probably the last thing" on the company's mind right now. However, a sale would make sense, Hughes suggested, but it may have to come from an overseas firm. International private equity firms are "flush with funds," and a potential turnaround opportunity in Asda is attractive. Nevertheless, Hughes added that it is "hard to identify a foreign buyer that really needs to enter the U.K." Bottom line, Hughes stated Asda isn't yet a "big enough problem" for Wal-Mart to make a decision on how to proceed today, but the "sell-by date " for any deal could drift away.

Opinion Op-Ed Op-Ed How the charter school lobby is changing the Democratic Party Steve Barr enters L.A.'s mayoral race Los Angeles Times An attorney looks on as Steve Barr signs the initial paperwork that the city and state require for candidates to run for office, at Barr's home in Silver Lake on June 24. Barr has announced that he will challenge L.A.'s incumbent Eric Garcetti for the mayoralty next year. An attorney looks on as Steve Barr signs the initial paperwork that the city and state require for candidates to run for office, at Barr's home in Silver Lake on June 24. Barr has announced that he will challenge L.A.'s incumbent Eric Garcetti for the mayoralty next year. (Los Angeles Times) Harold Meyerson At a time when Democrats and their party are, by virtually every index, moving left, a powerful center-right pressure group within the liberal universe has nonetheless sprung up. Funded by billionaires and arrayed against unions, it is increasingly contesting for power in city halls and statehouses where Democrats already govern. That’s not how the charter school lobby is customarily described, I’ll allow, but it’s most certainly what it’s become.

It's snowing in the Sierra. It started snowing Jan. 4, and you can already see what Mother Nature has wrought. Next year, the progressive mayors of America’s two largest and overwhelmingly Democratic cities – New York’s Bill de Blasio and Los Angeles’ Eric Garcetti – will each stand for reelection. So far, the only visible challenger to Garcetti’s bid is Steve Barr, founder of the Green Dot charter schools. In New York, de Blasio’s critics have suggested that Success Academy Charter Chief Executive Eva Moskowitz would be the candidate most likely to depose the mayor, though Moskowitz has denied any interest in running. This abrupt elevation (or self-elevation) of today’s charter school entrepreneurs into tomorrow’s civic leaders may seem surprising, but it’s part of a larger pattern. In California, political action committees funded by charter school backers have become among the largest donors to centrist Democratic state legislators who not only favor expanding charters at the expense of school districts, but also have blocked some of Gov. Jerry Brown’s more liberal initiatives. In New York’s upcoming primary, such longtime charter supporters as Wal-Mart heiress Alice Walton have given hundreds of thousands of dollars to a PAC seeking to unseat several Democratic legislators who’ve defended the role and budget of traditional public schools. In future decades, historians will have to grapple with how charter schools became the cause celebre of centrist billionaires – from Walton to Bloomberg to Broad – in an age of plutocracy. The historians shouldn’t dismiss the good intentions behind the billionaires’ impulse: the desire to provide students growing up in poverty with the best education possible. But neither should they dismiss their self-exculpation in singling out the deficiencies, both real and exaggerated, of public education as the central reason for the evisceration of the middle class.  In their mix of good intentions and self-serving blindness, the billionaire education reformers have much in common with ... their Gilded Age predecessors. If Wal-Mart, the corporation from which Walton derives her wealth, hadn’t compelled its suppliers to make their products abroad to reduce the price of their goods, more public school students’ parents might have the kind of stable employment and adequate incomes that foster learning-friendly upbringings. Despite the fact that our traditional ladders of mobility – decent blue-collar and service sector jobs, unions, cross-class marriages – have largely collapsed, seemingly sentient billionaires insist that teachers and their unions are the main obstacles blocking young people’s escape from poverty. The poor, or their tribunes, don’t necessarily agree. In the past couple of weeks, both the Movement for Black Lives (50 organizations active in the Black Lives Matter movement) and the NAACP passed resolutions declaring that charter schools increase segregation and leave school districts with both fewer resources and a more challenging student body. While many in minority communities dispute these views, there’s clearly some real skepticism about the merits of charterizing education among the very people it purports to help. That’s one reason the Steve Barrs and Eva Moskowitzes aren’t likely to be supplanting their mayors next year. But the charter advocates don’t need to win the high-visibility offices to prevail. By spending sufficiently to shift the composition of Democratic caucuses in legislatures, city councils or school boards to the right, they can undermine public education. Whether they mean to or not, by backing more conservative Democrats, they can also impede unrelated progressive initiatives for greater environmental protections and worker rights. And by making Democratic elected officials even more dependent on the mega-donations of the 1%, they make campaign finance reform all the harder to win. In their mix of good intentions and self-serving blindness, the billionaire education reformers have much in common with some of the upper-class progressives of a century ago, another time of great wealth and pervasive poverty. Some of those progressives, in the tradition of Jane Addams, genuinely sought to diminish the economy’s structural inequities, but others focused more on the presumed moral deficiencies and lack of discipline of the poor. Whatever the merits of charters, the very rich who see them as the great equalizer are no closer to the mark than their Gilded Age predecessors who preached temperance as the answer to squalor.

NEW YORK — U.S. retailers including J.C. Penney and Wal-Mart are scrutinizing whether sheets Welspun India Ltd. said were high-end Egyptian cotton were in fact cheaper knock-offs, a question that has sent the textile company's shares plunging. Since Target announced Friday that it was pulling the sheets from its stores and online and was terminating its relationship with the company, other retailers have launched investigations into the certification claims from Welspun, one of India's largest textile makers. Target said an investigation confirmed that Welspun used another type of non-Egyptian cotton between August 2014 and July, and the retailer is offering refunds to its RedCard and Target.com customers who bought the sheets during that time. Target declined to say what spurred its investigation. Welspun told investors this week it's conducting an audit. It said in a conference call that the product in question with Target accounts for about 1 percent of the textile company's sales. Welspun's shares have fallen more than 40 percent since Friday on the BSE, the largest exchange in India, and were down 8 percent Thursday. Wal-Mart spokeswoman Marilee McInnis said Welspun supplies the retailer with a number of products, including some of the sheets. She said Wal-Mart is reviewing Welspun's certification records and plans to have “additional conversations” with the company. Bed, Bath & Beyond said it is working with an independent third party to audit the supply chain and will “aggressively pursue its investigation and take appropriate action, if needed.” Penney said it was too early in its review to determine what actions may be necessary. Macy's said Welspun produces some of the chain's private-brand products but they are not involved in this situation because they are not marketed as 100 percent Egyptian cotton. But it said it is monitoring developments. More Business Mt.

Earnings excluding one-time items rose to 321 million rand ($23 million) from 269 million rand a year earlier, the Johannesburg-based company said in a statement on Thursday. Sales increased 8.7 percent to 42 billion rand and the company reduced the half-year dividend by 49 percent to 74.1 South African cents. Slower economic growth and the effect of the weaker rand on the price of imports dampened consumer spending on durable goods, the company said. In contrast, food and liquor sales rose by 13 percent as the company increased its market share, Chief Executive Officer Guy Hayward told reporters on a conference call. The divergence in performance reflects a “defensive economic environment where food does better than non food,” he said. “Our drive into food of a few years ago is paying for itself.” ‘Quietly Confident’ South African retailers have wrestled this year with challenges including drought-related food-price inflation, weak domestic confidence and rising interest rates. While consumer spending is likely to remain constrained and food prices will probably rise further in the second half of the year, conditions may improve in 2017, Hayward said. “We are quietly confident about next year,” he said in a presentation in Johannesburg. “But the second half of this year we think will be exceptionally tough.” The shares erased declines to trade 1 percent higher at 135.28 rand by 11:51 a.m. in Johannesburg, extending the year’s gain to 35 percent. Massmart is the best performer on the FTSE/JSE Africa General Retailers Index in 2016. Wal-Mart, based in Bentonville, Arkansas and the world’s largest retailer, bought a controlling stake in Massmart in 2011 to take advantage of African growth. Massmart’s stores in the rest of Africa increased sales by 23 percent, or 17 percent on a constant local-currency basis, the retailer said. The company expects to open five new stores outside of South Africa in the next two years, Hayward said. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.
