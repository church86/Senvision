Target Keeps Building Tiny Stores, Tries To Succeed Where Walmart Failed Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Target Keeps Building Tiny Stores, Tries To Succeed Where Walmart Failed Image courtesy of Steve September 14, 2016 5:11 pm EST By Laura Northrup@lnorthrup tiny targets mini-stores small big boxes target brian cornell For the first half of this decade, Walmart experimented with mini-stores: tiny Walmarts that fanned out across the country, serving markets too small to support a full-size store. The experiment ultimately failed, and Walmart closed all of its Express stores at the beginning of 2016. Target, however, wants to take over the business of building tiny big boxes, planning to build at least 25 more through 2017. The chains’ strategies do differ, though. Target’s mini-stores are in urban neighborhoods where a full-size Target simply wouldn’t fit, while the Walmart Express experiment mostly put stores in small rural towns. Target CEO Brian Cornell said today during the company’s annual meeting that if the concept succeeds, we could see hundreds of tiny Targets across the country. “Tiny” is a relative term when it comes to big-box stores, of course, since the smaller Target stores are usually about 50,000 square feet. Notably, though, both chains have experimented with mini-stores on or near college campuses. Cornell says that a store near the University of Maryland, for example, carries a lot of clothing and cosmetics. A second purpose for mini-stores is as access points: yes, you can buy stuff there, but more importantly, they bring in-store pickup closer to urban dwellers.

A man told police that two cars pulled up in the parking lot, and blocking his car in the parking spot. He said the victim was putting groceries into the back of his car when three people got out and started punching and kicking him. Luckily for him, a Comanche Nation officer happened to see the fight, and ran over to help. He drew his service weapon and ordered everyone to get on the ground until Lawton police got there. "I would do it a 100 times over if I had to and If I see someone else in trouble, you can guarantee it, I'll be right there to help them," John Lawrence, Comanche Nation Police Officer. Officer John Lawrence says he was just running a quick errand with his wife, son and daughter and on the way out unexpectedly witnessed a fight. Oddly enough, he says this isn't the first time this has happened at the same Walmart. He once broke up a small fight after someone attempted to steal from the store. He says stepping up to put an end to it, just came natural. "It's just pure instincts. No one deserves to be treated that way. No one deserves to be hurt Whether I'm in law enforcement or not, I think any good citizen would do the same thing and any law enforcement officer would do the same thing. It's our obligation as a human being, as a person," said Lawrence. A witness close by was able to capture some of the incident on video. He says he's thankful the officer was at the right place at the right time. "I was just thinking holy cow this is going on right in front of me. I was just shocked. I was completely shocked that I was in Walmart and I was around for something like that to happen. I was a little scared that I didn't know what was going to happen, that guns were drawn," said Patrick Carney, a witness. Carney says he's thankful there are good Samaritans and officers who will step up and protect this community whether they're on duty or not. "I just want to say thank you to that officer for doing his job, and I mean, he did a great job. He defused the situation and he showed his badge to let everyone know he was a police officer and not just some random guy with a gun," said Carney. Lawrence says the victim's wife and young child were close by when he was attacked. He says knowing he might have helped save that man's life is touching. "I mean, it makes me feel good. I'm glad that he's able to go home to his newborn son and and take his wife and newborn son home and spend the rest of the day with them, rather than being in the hospital or worse. He didn't deserve to have that happen to him and his child didn't deserve to have that happen in front of him," said Lawrence. Officer Lawrence says he hopes other Samaritans will learn from this and not be afraid to put an end to incidents where people might be in danger. He also says if you do carry a firearm, to make sure you do have a conceal and carry permit. Two of the suspects were arrested for disorderly conduct. The third person involved, ran away from the scene.  Copyright 2016 KSWO. All rights reserved.

Responding paramedics administered Narcan to revive the Newbury man, 21, and took him to Hillcrest Hospital. Officers located multiple indicators of drug use in the stall. The incident was turned over to the drug enforcement unit for investigation. Theft from auto, Queens Park Avenue: A man reported Aug. 31 he believed his wallet was stolen from his vehicle while it was parked in his driveway. He believed he left the vehicle unlocked because there were no signs of forced entry. Inside the wallet were debit and credit cards, which he learned had been used fraudulently to make purchases at a Giant Eagle store in Cleveland and at an unknown Walmart location. The four purchases at Giant Eagle totaled over $350 and the Walmart purchase was $106.21. Officers are investigating and checking to see if the Giant Eagle store has surveillance video of the transaction. Theft, Mayfield Road: A woman and her fiancé suspect a friend that they allowed to briefly live with them when he moved from Florida, may have stolen the woman's debit card before he moved out of their apartment Aug. 30. There were fraudulent charges made to the card at the city's Target store and online at T-Mobile. They said there was nobody else in the apartment and the charges were made a day before the man, 26, moved out. While he was there, they said they had issues with him regarding living conditions, personal space, personal property and unusual behaviors. The woman's bank is investigating. Theft from building, Eastgate Plaza: A woman, 78, reported Sept. 1 her wallet was stolen from her purse while she was shopping at Marc's the previous day. She said a woman kept asking her questions about cereals and she answered her questions because she wanted to be polite. At one point, she said she turned her back to her purse, which was in her cart. She was unable to locate the wallet after the encounter. Inside the purse, was her roommate's credit card, which the man, 80, later found to have been used fraudulently at the Home Depot in Euclid to make a $1,287 purchase. Officers reviewed surveillance video from Marc's but did not see the incident or any suspects. They are investigating and trying to obtain surveillance video from Home Depot. Theft, Mayfield Road: A True North Shell employee reported at 1:30 a.m. Sept. 3 a man stole a can of Mike's Hard Lemonade after she declined selling it to him because of the time of day. She said he concealed it in his pants and left the store. She provided officers with a description of the vehicle he left in and they located the vehicle and stopped it at a neighboring business. The driver denied stealing the item, but it was subsequently located inside the vehicle and the Mayfield Heights man, 20, was cited for theft, driving under suspension and underage alcohol possession. Two passengers were inside the vehicle. One was drunk and the other also had a suspended driver's license. Impaired driving, Mayfield Road: A Mayfield Village man, 27, was arrested for OVI after officers found him asleep at the wheel of his vehicle at 1 a.m. Sept. 4. His foot was on the brake and the car was in gear. Officers had to tell him how to move the gear shifter to place it into park. He said he was coming from Panini's and admitted he had been drinking alcohol. Menacing, Mayfield Road: A woman, 21, reported at 11:50 p.m. Sept. 5 a car, occupied by five people, followed her from Lyndhurst into the city and then into the Walmart parking lot. She said the occupants were yelling at her as she drove and she was trying to elude them. At one point, she said the driver tried to run her off the road, causing her five-year-old daughter to hit her head on a back seat window. After she turned into the parking lot, she said she remained in her car as they all surrounded it and yelled at her for being scared. She said the male, who had been driving, then yelled at her to get out of the car while pointing a gun at her. She was subsequently able to drive to the police station. She provided officers with the license plate number of the suspect's car and a picture she took of one of them. The vehicle was registered to a 22-year-old Cleveland Heights man. Officers from that city checked his residence, but did not locate the car. The woman did not know any of the people in the car. She said there were two female and two male passengers. The incident remains under investigation. Suspicion, SOM Center Road: Officers responded to the Target parking lot Sept. 3 after someone saw a man trying to force a child into his car. They learned the man was the child's father and the boy was upset because he did not get a toy at the store. The boy calmed down and the family left the area. Disturbance, Marsol Road: Just after midnight Sept. 4, a woman, 54, reported her boyfriend was at her apartment and tried to steal her dog. She said they had both been drinking alcohol. Responding officers learned the couple was only arguing. The woman's son arrived and said he would monitor the situation and call police if there was a problem. While there, officers confiscated a sword for safekeeping and told the man he could retrieve it when he becomes sober. Suspicion, Lander Road: A Mattress Firm manager said Sept. 4 it appeared someone broke into the store because the staff found empty beer cans inside of it. He said they would file a report if they found anything missing or damaged and he requested special attention to the store.

Dan Voorhis The Wichita Eagle Kroger, the parent of Dillons, said it expects grocery prices overall to stay down into 2017. Dan Voorhis The Wichita Eagle 1 of 2 i By Dan Voorhis dvoorhis@wichitaeagle.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story The low price of eggs is a nice surprise at the grocery store these days – but is it too much of a good thing? Prices for eggs – as well as for cheese and other dairy products, meat, grains, gasoline and diesel fuel – are all down from a year ago. And it’s giving grocers indigestion. Kroger, parent of Dillon Stores, and Wal-Mart – the nation’s two largest grocers – both reported in recent conference calls an overall fall in food prices, which has cut sales growth, profit growth and their stock prices in recent quarters. Corporate officials and analysts in the industry have dubbed it “food deflation.” It’s caused by a low ebb in the cycles of a series of food commodities sold on grocery store shelves. The price drop has caused trouble for food producers, manufacturers and, now, grocers. The big winners are consumers. The price drop is a big factor in holding down inflation and allowing people to survive on their wages, which had been fairly stagnant until recently. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the price of food bought to eat at home was down 1.6 percent from a year ago, even while the price of food bought at restaurants was up 2.6 percent. So what does that mean for the big grocery chains when prices are falling? It’s a challenge to their financial models, which assume price inflation, allowing them to show increased store sales and more flexibility in pricing. Kroger CEO Rodney McMullen told analysts in a recent conference call that the chain’s grocery prices overall were down 1.5 percent for the quarter compared to a year ago. Wal-Mart, in its most recent quarterly filing, showed that food prices were down 1 percent compared to a year ago. Jim Hertel, senior vice president of industry consulting firm Willard Bishop and Inman Analytics, said falling food prices expose store operations to greater scrutiny. Kroger, for instance, held off on $500 million in capital expenditures because profit growth didn’t hit targets. “I think the key piece of it is that, for years, grocery retailers have counted on 3 to 5 percent food inflation as a source of profit growth, and when that’s not forthcoming, as we are seeing, it sheds lights on other parts of the business,” he said. Why are prices down? Commodities prices cycle up and down based on supply and demand. In recent years, U.S. crop and livestock farmers enjoyed high prices caused by drought and strong export demand. To take advantage, they pushed to increase production, which then turned into overproduction as the drought receded, weather improved and global demand for U.S. exports slackened. Grain prices and gasoline prices dropped sharply in late 2014, and meat and poultry prices started dropping sharply last year. Eggs had a particularly sharp price drop. When the bird flu arrived from Asia in the spring of 2015, egg and meat producers in the West and the Midwest destroyed 40 million chickens to contain the infection. As chicken and egg prices shot up, consumers and processed-food manufacturers cut back. The industry recovered in numbers faster than expected, but some of the demand hasn’t returned. The result: a price collapse for eggs, down 29 percent from a year ago, according to the USDA. Beef producers and packers saw a similar cycle, but it was spread out over more time. The Midwestern drought of 2011 to 2014 pushed up the costs of raising cattle, causing many ranchers to cut back their herds. By 2013, the rains started to return, and farmers started holding back female calves to breed, adding to the shortage. By late 2014 and into early 2015, beef prices were sky high. But as additional cattle started working its way through the system, prices started dropping. As of July, beef prices are down 7.7 percent from a year ago. Also from a year ago, dairy prices are down 3.1 percent and poultry is down 3.2 percent. Even the price of cereals and bakery products, such as bread or crackers, is down 0.8 percent, according to the USDA. Only the price of fresh fruits and vegetables was up, by 1.4 percent. Compounding the problem for some grocery chains is that Wal-Mart, the nation’s largest grocer, has aggressively recommitted to lowering prices. The company is also dealing with food deflation but is better able than most grocers to absorb that, with its broad array of general merchandise products. “You always want that customer coming away realizing that, on a basket of goods, they got the best deal at Wal-Mart. And that’s who we are as a company,” chief financial officer Brett Biggs said at an investor conference this month. McMullen, Kroger’s CEO, said the company – which has focused its strategy on the customer experience rather than simply price – hasn’t seen much impact from its competitors, such as Wal-Mart. How will this fix itself? McMullen told analysts he expects deflation to continue into early next year. “High prices solve high prices, and low prices solve low prices,” McMullen said in the conference call. “Farmers are smart, and they will start producing less of the things that don’t make money.” As demand rises and supplies fall, prices will start to rise. But Hertel, the industry analyst, said there may be some longer-term changes that gradually steer grocers away from being so dependent on the up-and-down swings of the commodities markets. The more processing and preparation involved in food sales, the less commodities price swings will matter, he said. That dovetails with the arrival of the millennial generation and its bias toward more convenience and quality over concerns about price, Hertel said. “Right now, the grocery industry is focused on food consumed at home,” Hertel said. “But you’re starting to see a real blurring in the midst of this deflation. “One of the things creeping in is a move to more prepared foods in store. They’re called ‘grocerants.’ “And that move to more prepared foods will start to mitigate their dependence on some of the commodity price fluctuations,” Hertel said. facebook twitter email Share More Videos 2:29 Woman killed, infant missing Pause 2:49 Salvation Army announces fundraising goal to kick off holiday season 3:07 So what can Trump actually do in his first 100 days? 0:36 30-second pizza 1:35 Trump transition team member: Wall will get built 0:42 Supermoon over Wichita 3:10 Wichita State forwards come up big in win over Tulsa 4:38 Dining with Denise: Wichita's most obscene foods 0:39 Fatal shooting on East Harry 0:15 Quarterback celebrates with a heart for his sister Share Video Video link: Select Embed code: Select facebook twitter email Dillons adds online grocery shopping in Wichita Starting at the 21st and Maize store and moving to six stores in the market by year's end, Dillons is adding online shopping.

Patent reveals 'disc-shaped' robots that allow carts to navigate the stores Patent filed 4 months before rumors surfaced of driverless carts Describes motorized robots that could slide underneath shopping carts Customers could control units with mobile device or voice commands  Also describes 'parcel retrieval process' that places items in the cart e-mail 67 shares 4 View comments While driverless cars may be a few years away, it appears self-driving shopping carts are right around the corner. Walmart has been awarded a patent illustrating ‘disc-shaped’ robots that use sensors and cameras to transport and navigate shopping carts throughout stores. This application comes two months after reports surfaced that the firm was developing driverless carts that scan a customer's shopping list and then guide them to the aisles and shelves. The patent suggests the system could easily retrieve abandon carts ‘in and around the area of the shopping facility, including the sale floor areas and back-room areas’. Pictured are the motorized robots underneath the shopping carts WALMART'S NEW  PATENT  Walmart was awarded a patent called ‘Shopping Facility Assistance Systems, Devices and Methods’ is the patents title which was filed on March 4, 2016. The pages describe a ‘motorized transport unit’ that is a disc-shaped robotic device designed with motorized wheels, which transports and navigates the shopping carts through the store.  Customers could summon the robots by pushing a button. When the cart arrives, the person would either push the cart or have the robot drive. It could also be controlled with a mobile device or voice commands.  The document describes components of inventory tracking and parcel retrieval process using a multitiered inventory system. Illustrations suggest the shopping cart would be navigated to specific locations where items could be placed, swept or blown into the car ‘Shopping Facility Assistance Systems, Devices and Methods’ is the title of a patent filed on March 4, 2016, which is just four months before Bloomberg reported that Five Elements Robotics collaborated with Wal-Mart to build the tech savvy carts. DailyMail.com has contacted Walmart for comment and has yet to hear a response. The new patent presents an illustration of a ‘motorized transport unit’ that is a disc-shaped robotic device designed with motorized wheels. These devices are neatly arranged in a docking area, where they wait to be summoned by shoppers. Somewhere in the store will be a central computer that transmits a wireless signal to the unit, informing it of the customer’s location after the human pushes the request button, reports PatentYogi. The motorized unit then exits the holding area and navigates itself to the shopping cart storage where it slides under an empty cart, and both objects then head towards the customer's location.  Customers would have two options with Walmart's technology: they can either detach the shopping cart from the robotic disk to push it themselves or navigate the motorized unit using a mobile device.

These devices are neatly arranged in a docking area, where they wait to be summoned by shoppers The motorized unit then exits the holding area and navigates itself to the shopping car storage where it slides under an empty shopping cart, and both objects then head towards the customer's location. It has a second tier that activates when it slides under a shopping cart Although this technology is aimed at helping its customers, Walmart believes it will also be a fan favorite among its employees. The pages in the patent suggests the system could easily retrieve abandon carts ‘in and around the area of the shopping facility, including the sale floor areas and back-room areas’. The technology would use its visual recognition to tap into the store’s cameras, user interface units and central computer systems to identify the lonely shopping carts and use the motorized units to return them back to the storing area.  Customers has two options: they can either detach the shopping cart from the robotic disk to push it themselves or navigate the motorized unit using a mobile device. The patent also suggests the system could respond to voice commands REPORTS FROM BLOOMBERG Wal-Mart is working with a robotics firm to developing 'driverless' shopping carts that help customers find items on their lists. It has implemented tools that allow consumers to scan and purchase items using their mobile phones –without ever having to step foot in a checkout line. Wal-Mart is also working on an online grocery service that brings a cart full of edibles right to the customer's vehicle in the parking lot and in some cities the firm has teamed up with Uber and Lyft for home delivery. Walmart's new system may also end the frustration of not being able to find items on your shopping list. The document describes components of inventory tracking and parcel retrieval process using a multitiered inventory system. Illustrations suggest the shopping cart would navigate to specific locations where items could be placed, swept or blown into the car - this portion coincides with news that surfaced this past June. Altogether, this new innovation is a way for Walmart to compete with the convenience that Amazon and other online stores offer consumers. 'I don't have a lot of details to share but here's what I can tell you', Ravi Jariwala, director of public relations at Wal-Mart, told DailyMail.com in June. Walmart has been awarded a patent illustrating ‘disc-shaped’ robots that use sensors and cameras to navigate shopping carts for customers throughout shopping centers. This is just two months after rumors surfaced that the firm was developing driverless carts 'We test many new technologies at any given time, including innovations from several companies.' 'We are focused on testing how these advanced technologies can help make shopping faster, easier and more convenient for our customers.' Bloomberg reported that Five Elements Robotics has collaborated with Wal-Mart to build the tech savvy carts, following a panel discussion with the New Jersey firm's founder and CEO Wendy Roberts. During the conference, Roberts said they are working on a project with the 'world's largest retailer', a title given to Wal-Mart this year by Market Watches. And although Wal-Mart has declined to share any details, a person familiar told Bloomberg that a prototype is currently in the works and the firm is providing feedback on the design and technology.  Rumors surfaced in June that Walmart was working with a robotics firm to develop 'driverless' shopping carts that will help customers find items on their lists. This new innovation is a way for the retiler to compete with the convenience that Amazon WAL-MART TO TAKE ON AMAZON IN DRONE WARS  Wal-Mart says using the drones enables it to check inventory in about a day or less, instead of a month that it takes manually. Right now, employees stand on lifts that go up and down the stacks, and scan items to make sure that boxes are in the right place. Shekar Natarajan, Wal-Mart's vice president of logistics strategy, told reporters the technology is custom-built on top of the drone and is proprietary for Wal-Mart. 'We are still in early phases of testing and understanding how drones can be better used in different types of business functions,' he said. The remotely controlled drone captured 30 frames per second of products on aisles and alerted the user when product ran out or was incorrectly stocked. Natarajan said drones can reduce the labor intensive process of checking stocks around the warehouse to one day. It currently takes a month to finish manually. A control tower will oversee the images on a screen and will send alerts when items are flagged so that workers can go back to the stacks to fix the issue. This innovation is among a handful of others the American corporation is developing in order to compete with e-commerce sites that are slowly taking over the world of retail.  Wal-Mart has implemented tools that allow consumers to scan and purchase items using their mobile phones –without ever having to step foot in a checkout line. It is also working on an online grocery service that brings a cart full of edibles right to the customer's vehicle in the parking lot and in some cities the firm has teamed up with Uber and Lyft for home delivery. Although Walmart declined to share details, a person familiar told Bloomberg that a prototype is currently in the works and the firm is providing feedback on the design and technology. This innovation is among a handful of others the American corporation is developing The grocery service is said to be a bid to gain back shares and business Wal-Mart has lost to rivals like Kroger and Costco Wholesale. Since 2008, grocery sales at Wal-Mart US division has contributed 100.4 percent of its sales growth, which is $48.7 billion, increasing overall revenue from 47 percent to 56 percent, reports The Motley Fool. The retailer is also toying with drones as a method to deliver online orders or monitor inventory in its distribution centers. AMAZON DRONE DELIVERIES COULD BEGIN IN TWO YEARS  Drones could be bringing parcels to your door within two years, thanks to a bill that left the Senate in april. The bipartisan aviation policy bill, which passed the Senate 95-3 earlier this month, demands that the Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) authorize package deliveries by drones within two years. Amazon says Prime Air will start once government regulations are in place to support it. It has development centers in the U.S., the U.K. and Israel The bill, which must now be debated by the House, also makes changes to various regulations including those affecting airport security and airplane pricing. The FAA currently bans commercial drone flights but has granted several thousand waivers. It has granted Amazon approval to fly drones for research. The drones will fly under 400 feet and weigh less than 55 pounds, according to details posted on Amazon's web site.  Amazon says Prime Air will start once government regulations are in place to support it. It has development centers in the U.S., the U.K. and Israel. Although Wal-Mart has been operating since 1962, the corporation has stuck very close to its traditional ways of operating. However, as technology advances the firm has found itself in a race to impress investors – not only with competing technology, but prove they can maintain the honorable title of 'world's largest retailer'. Over the past few years, Wal-Mart has reported a slow in revenues and profits are projected to fall as much as 12 percent this year due to more spending on wages and its technology operations.   Read more: Wal-Mart Experimenting With Robotic Shopping Cart for Stores - Bloomberg Why Wal-Mart Needs Grocery Pick-Up to Work -- The Motley Fool Self-driven shopping carts to follow Walmart shoppers - PatentYogi Share or comment on this article e-mail 67 shares Most watched News videos Autistic boy bursts into tears on stage as teacher snatches microphone Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Good pup!

Working on Self-Driving Shopping Carts The carts could help customers find items in the store Sep 14, 2016, 11:24 am EST  |  By William White, InvestorPlace Writer     Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is working on self-driving shopping carts. Source: Flickr A patent filed by Walmart with the US Patent & Trademark Office reveals plans for shopping carts that customers can summon with the aide of an interface device, which would likely be a smartphone. The patent mentions that these carts would have motors attached to them with sensors that could let them see their surroundings. One possible use of the Walmart self-driving shopping carts would be returning carts to the store. This could mean that carts corrals would no longer be needed and employees wouldn’t be given the task. The cart could also scan store shelves to assure that they stay stocked with products for customers to buy and lead them to the items. The system to create self-driving shopping carts would have the company retrofitting its normal carts with new technology. This technology would be a motor with various sensors. The motor in the patent is detachable, which means it could be used on different carts, reports CNNMoney. Five Elements Robotics is reportedly working with Walmart to develop the self-driving shopping carts. The robotics company is said to be evaluating a prototype in its lab. This wouldn’t be the company’s first helpful robot. It also released Budgee in 2014. This robot is designed to help a person carry things in inside and outside environments. It has been used to help people with disabilities, Bloomberg notes. Walmart’s work on self-driving shopping carts is likely part of an effort to make shopping easier on customers. The retailer has been working to find ways to better compete with online retailer Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN).

 You'll soon be able to get cookie fries and deep-fried hash browns at this Walmart Kate Taylor Sep. 14, 2016, 10:18 AM 1,198 facebook linkedin twitter email print Issac Rousso's Cookie Fries were named Most Creative at this years' Big Tex Awards at the State Fair. State Fair of Texas A Walmart in Plano, Texas is about to become a destination for bizarre, deep-fried foods.  State Fair Treats will open next week, serving items inspired by State Fair favorites such as cookie fries, funnel cake fries, and deep-fried hash browns stuffed with bacon and cheddar cheese, reports the Dallas News.  The restaurant — which replaced a McDonald's previously located in the Walmart — is the brainchild of Issac Rousso, a restaurateur who has established himself as a State Fair champion. Rousso's past State Fair hits, which will serve as menu inspiration for the Walmart location, include the Smoky Bacon Margarita, Deep Fried Cuban Roll, and Fried Pop Tart.  Why yes, I think I will!! #texasstatefair #smokybaconmargarita A photo posted by @offgridtinylife_shelly on Oct 17, 2015 at 9:09am PDT on Oct 17, 2015 at 9:09am PDT "Walmart was looking for a creative new food concept to energize high-profile locations," Rousso told Dallas News. "They loved the idea of finding someone who was able to take an idea and constantly create something fresh and innovative." While many Walmart locations around the US have long rented space to local franchises, such as Subway or McDonald's, it is less common to see original concepts like State Fair Treats.  Rousso's Deep-Fried Cuban Roll won the Best Taste Big Tex Award in 2013. State Fair of Texas Walmart will serve as the landlord, not an investor in State Fair Treats, according to the Dallas News. The hope is the restaurant will serve as another reason to visit the store.  Collaborations between retailers and restaurants are increasingly common, as retailers look for ways to improve in-store experience and boost traffic. Whole Foods is opening an outpost of the popular vegan concept By Chloe in a store in Los Angeles and investing in the gourmet sandwich chain Mendocino Farms. Last year, Urban Outfitters purchased a pizza chain and several fine-dining restaurants.  SEE ALSO: Walmart is patenting 'mini-robot' technology that could have terrifying implications for workers NOW WATCH: FAST FOOD WARS: Burger King goes all in with 'Cheetos Chicken Fries' Loading video...

READ MORE READ MORE READ MORE Share Hayley Peterson Sep 14th 2016 9:33AM Target is losing customers to Walmart and Amazon, according to new research. The retailer recently revealed that shopper traffic is declining for the first time in years. The decline immediately followed the start of a boycott against Target for its policy welcoming transgender customers to use any bathroom or fitting room that matches their gender identity. But Cowen & Co. analysts say the real reason shoppers are abandoning Target is because they can find better prices and more convenience elsewhere. STOCK PRICE FOR TGTFull price information According to the analysts, Target is losing the business of shoppers who visited the retailer for "fill-in" trips — or quick stops to get a small amount of items between larger "stock-up" trips. Shoppers are cutting down on these "fill-in" trips to Target because they are finding cheaper prices at Walmart and more convenience with Amazon Prime, according to data compiled by Cowen & Co. "Amazon is seeing explosive growth in several categories most notably grocery and consumables, which accounts for 45-50% of Target's business and are likely the categories feeling pressure from the 'fill-in' trip dynamics," the analysts wrote in a research note published Monday. "In our view, Walmart can use its scale to compete on price to regain or maintain market share vs. Amazon... but Target cannot compete as easily." Associated PressTarget's same-store transactions, which is how traffic is measured, fell 2.2% in the second quarter. Overall, sales fell 7.2% to $16.2 billion. "In the second quarter, our No. 1 challenge was traffic, which affected sales in all of our merchandise categories," Target CEO Brian Cornell said last week on a call with analysts. Target is planning to overhaul its grocery department to better compete with its rivals, but analysts say the changes will take too long to accomplish.

Walmart, Kroger, Harris Teeter, Giant Food, and other chains have started offering online grocery pickup, meaning customers can order their groceries online and pick them up at a nearby store.

The American shopping giant has imagined a complete ecosystem, from store to end-user, which would allow a container of purchase to travel from a designated space to a customer, follow the shopper, and drive back to its place after it becomes empty again. In other words, WalMart has thought of a way to make shopping carts autonomous. These vehicles would operate using a multitude of sensors, but their primary advantage would be the knowledge of the “map.” Since none of the vehicles would leave WalMart’s parking lot, the company would not have to go to great lengths to make them independent or outstandingly smart. Think about it - the fleet of autonomous shopping carts could be controlled seamlessly from a central node in each store, while each of the carts would drive itself after its human user. Since people do not tend to be fast while walking through stores, the speed of operation would be humble, and they might make the cart even slower than average walking pace just to keep it safe. The patent application already mentions the fact that the customer selects the cart with a “user interface device,” which could mean a smartphone with an app. The phone would only be used to identify and “tag” the client, so that the cart would know whom to follow. Evidently, merely patenting an autonomous shopping cart will not make it a reality. Wal-Mart would probably not replace all of its carts with the self-driving units because of the costs that would be involved in the move. However, in the name of convenience, a few might be placed at every store once they will be available. Expect them to be offered to customers that have locomotion deficiencies. In other words, if you can walk without assistance, you can probably push you shopping cart just fine. Otherwise, shopping might be a hassle and bring numerous impediments.  Download attachment: Walmart patent application (PDF) Walmart self-driving cars self-driving vehicles autonomous car technology shopping technology autonomous   What if Jaguar and Land Rover Weren't British Anymore?

News Room SOURCE: High Performance Beverage Co. September 14, 2016 07:30 ET High Performance Beverage Co. Confirms Meeting With Walmart for Distribution in Mexico, Talks to Include Potential Sales in Sam's Clubs in U.S. CAVE CREEK, AZ--(Marketwired - Sep 14, 2016) - High Performance Beverage Co. (OTC PINK: TBEV) (the "Company") is pleased to announce confirmation of their meeting with Walmart for distribution of its High Performance Sports Drink in Mexico. Walmart de Mexico (WALMEX) represents Walmart's largest division outside of the U.S. consisting of 2,363 stores around the country, including 256 Walmart Supercenter stores and 160 Sam's Club stores. The meeting is currently set for October 05, 2016 at Walmart's corporate headquarters in Bentonville, AK and will include executive buyers from WALMEX and U.S. representatives. Any distribution into Mexico will be handled by Pro Prom, High Performance Beverages Licensee for Mexico, Central & South America. The Company also expects to start preliminary discussions on North American distribution in Sam's Clubs which has been initiated by Joey Girardin of Girardin International Marketing and Consulting Group.  Toby McBride, High Performance Beverage CEO, stated, "We are extremely grateful for the work that has been done by both Pro Prom and Girardin International Marketing and Consulting Group for the meetings set up with Walmart executives. While optimistic, we realize that with fast potential growth come many challenges that will need to be addressed. With that in mind, I would like to briefly address the Company's recent decision to increase its authorized shares. While we understand our shareholders concern, the increase is not necessarily reflective of the Company's intent to dramatically increase its outstanding shares. Rather, we felt it necessary to be proactive and prepared in the event of our decision to utilize our previously announced $5 million credit facility. Should that become necessary, it would be related to significant progress with our operations, inventory controls, distribution and sales. We would view that as a significant positive for our company. Our only other alternative would have been to do a reverse split in order to create reserve shares and that was not an option. We are hopeful that eventual royalties from sales through Pro Prom will allow us to eliminate our remaining notes, fuel growth and procure more conventional forms of financing. Taking this proactive approach is our best option to ensure our abilities to meet potential supply and demand needs. Additionally, unlike a stock split that is irreversible, we can always modify and reduce our authorized shares at a later date."  To purchase High Performance Sports Drink on Amazon Go to: https://www.amazon.com/Performance-Punch-16-Ounce-Pack/dp/B014Q64HEI About Pro Prom ProProm Mexico with offices in Mexico City DF, Monterrey Mexico and Guadalajara Mexico, is a 20 year old company specializing in the deployment and marketing of new products through the aggressive market penetration of new brands through their abilities to elevate brands with dedication, intensity, professionalism and the overall synergy they create when bringing a product to market. Most notably, ProProm was instrumental with the introduction and success of the Gatorade brand in Mexico.

Confirms Meeting With Walmart for Distribution in Mexico, Talks to Include Potential Sales in Sam's Clubs in U.S. CAVE CREEK, AZ -- (Marketwired) -- 09/14/16 -- High Performance Beverage Co. (OTC PINK: TBEV) (the "Company") is pleased to announce confirmation of their meeting with Walmart for distribution of its High Performance Sports Drink in Mexico. Walmart de Mexico (WALMEX) represents Walmart's largest division outside of the U.S. consisting of 2,363 stores around the country, including 256 Walmart Supercenter stores and 160 Sam's Club stores. The meeting is currently set for October 05, 2016 at Walmart's corporate headquarters in Bentonville, AK and will include executive buyers from WALMEX and U.S. representatives. Any distribution into Mexico will be handled by Pro Prom, High Performance Beverages Licensee for Mexico, Central & South America. The Company also expects to start preliminary discussions on North American distribution in Sam's Clubs which has been initiated by Joey Girardin of Girardin International Marketing and Consulting Group. Toby McBride, High Performance Beverage CEO, stated, "We are extremely grateful for the work that has been done by both Pro Prom and Girardin International Marketing and Consulting Group for the meetings set up with Walmart executives. While optimistic, we realize that with fast potential growth come many challenges that will need to be addressed. With that in mind, I would like to briefly address the Company's recent decision to increase its authorized shares. While we understand our shareholders concern, the increase is not necessarily reflective of the Company's intent to dramatically increase its outstanding shares. Rather, we felt it necessary to be proactive and prepared in the event of our decision to utilize our previously announced $5 million credit facility. Should that become necessary, it would be related to significant progress with our operations, inventory controls, distribution and sales. We would view that as a significant positive for our company. Our only other alternative would have been to do a reverse split in order to create reserve shares and that was not an option. We are hopeful that eventual royalties from sales through Pro Prom will allow us to eliminate our remaining notes, fuel growth and procure more conventional forms of financing. Taking this proactive approach is our best option to ensure our abilities to meet potential supply and demand needs. Additionally, unlike a stock split that is irreversible, we can always modify and reduce our authorized shares at a later date."

Suburbs Daily Southtown Southtown News Wal-Mart Supercenter opens in Olympia Fields; nearby grocer wary Walmart opens a Supercenter in Olympia Fields Will Konrath, the store manager of the new Walmart Supercenter in Olympia Fields, explains what the new store has to offer. Will Konrath, the store manager of the new Walmart Supercenter in Olympia Fields, explains what the new store has to offer. Erin GallagherDaily Southtown Privacy Policy Wal-Mart is opening a new 183,000-square-foot Supercenter in Olympia Fields Wednesday. A couple miles away, the owner of a small grocery store said bigger does not necessarily mean better, but he remains optimistic. The opening of a large store "will always impact some, but I don't think it will impact much," said Jeff Jabar, owner of Country Squire Foods, 113 W. Joe Orr Road, Chicago Heights. "(Customers) always turn around and come back to you." The Wal-Mart Supercenter at 21000 Western Ave. will employ 330 people and sell both food and general merchandise. Store manager Will Konrath said that the expansive variety of products will appeal to everyone. "Our target audience is going to be every type of customer," he said. The new Wal-Mart features organic and gluten-free products, he said. Along the wall of the bakery department, there are more than 20 racks filled with different varieties of fresh-baked breads and doughnuts. There are also more than 100 different rice products for sale. The Supercenter is not much different from the Richton Park Wal-Mart, 22401 Central Ave., which opened earlier this summer, Konrath said. There are some cosmetic differences, such as sign placement inside the store and lower tables for bakery goods. However, both offer similar services, such as the drive-thru pharmacy and custom cake decorating, he said. Walmart is opening a new 183,000-square-foot Supercenter in Olympia Fields Wednesday. A couple miles away, the owner of a small grocery store said bigger does not necessarily mean better, but he remains optimistic. Jabar said his 15,000-square- foot store offers convenience for people who do not want to take on the challenge of a large store. Country Squire customers Robert Plochl and Jackie McGarel of Chicago Heights agreed. "The (Wal-Mart) store is too big," said Plochl, 84. "You get lost in there." "I like the little personal stores, where the boss talks to me," McGarel said. Both Wal-Mart and Country Squire feature a wide variety of specialty items. Wal-Mart has an aisle of ethnic foods, which includes Asian fare. Jabar said Country Squire stocks foods reflecting the area's diverse community, such as numerous products from Italy and Mexico. For example, a typical store may stock 10 to 20 varieties of vinegars, but Country Squire stocks over 50. While other stores may carry two or three different Italian specialty salami, Country Squire stocks eight. John Zartuche of Chicago Heights, said he shops at Country Squire Foods for many reasons, not just the Italian foods indicative of his Sicilian heritage. In addition to wanting to support his local community, he said it's not worth "spending $10 dollars in gas to save a nickel." "I think his prices are fair," Zartuche said. Still, Wal-Mart offers numerous products and services that Country Squire does not, such as a pharmacy, a vision center, general merchandise and its own mobile app. In June, Wal-Mart launched Walmart Pay in Illinois, allowing customers to use a cellphone app for payment. "More than 20 million customers actively use the Wal-Mart app each month, and it ranks among the top three retail apps in the Google and Apple app stores," according to a Wal-Mart statement.

HILO, Hawaii – Safety concerns and potential construction violations at the Hilo Walmart were brought to the attention of the Hawaii County Council last week. The discussion took place September 7 during the meeting of the Committee on Public Works and Parks and Recreation, when Hilo councilman Aaron Chung shared recent complaints received by his office. The complaints came from the Pacific Resource Partnership, which represents the Hawaii Regional Council of Carpenters and more than 240 contractors. According to Chris Delaney of PRP, Walmart is doing an unpermitted renovation. He also accused Walmart of hiring unlicensed subcontractors and committing OSHA violations. Part of the problem seemed to be confusion over Hawaiian Homelands regulation. “We had a tenant that was operating under the mistaken belief that they did not have to get a permit, because the original person that built the building – DHHL – had taken themselves out of county regulation,” said Brandon Gonzalez, deputy public works director. Public Works said Walmart has submitted its plans for review in order to get the proper building permit. Walmart faces a penalty for its after-the-fact permit application.

He told KNXV that he has a leg injury, which is why he decided to use a motorized shopping scooter. Avalos decided to investigate the scooter, and that’s when he saw the tiny brown bugs on the seat. He and his girlfriend, Lupita Cruz, went to look for another scooter to use and found more bed bugs. “I got out of the chair, turned around and the whole chair was infested with bed bugs,” he said. Pest expert and owner of The Works Pest Control Ian Campbell told KNXV that the bugs probably appeared on the scooters after someone who has an infestation at home came into Walmart and that anyone who sat on the scooters could have brought the pests back to their home. “That person goes home and sits on their couch and instantly the bed bug tries to hide,” Campbell said. “That bed bug is going to feed on [that person] and once they feed they start laying eggs.” Walmart released a statement regarding the incident. “The carts have been pulled from public use, and we’re awaiting a team to arrive at the store for testing,” Walmart’s senior manager of corporate communications Charles Crowson  said in the statement. If you’re worried about taking bed bugs home and ending up with an infestation in your house, you can take precautions. “All the clothes you’re wearing, put them in the dryer on high heat for about an hour and a half or so,” Campbell advises.

He vowed that his company and other supporters would continue their efforts to promote the alternative plans in other states. (Dylan Hollingsworth for ProPublica) This story was co-published with NPR. A national campaign to rewrite state laws and allow businesses to decide how to care for their injured workers suffered a significant setback Tuesday when the Oklahoma Supreme Court ruled that Oklahoma’s version of the law is unconstitutional. The 2013 legislation gave Oklahoma employers the ability to “opt out” of the state workers’ compensation system and write their own plans, setting the terms for what injuries were covered, which doctors workers could see, how workers were compensated and how disputes were handled. The statute was backed by the oil and gas industry and retailer Hobby Lobby. Buoyed by the success in Oklahoma, proponents took the idea nationwide as a coalition led by Walmart, Lowe’s and several of the largest retail, trucking and health care companies sought to pass similar laws across the country. Bills and draft proposals have been floated in Tennessee, South Carolina, Georgia, Mississippi, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Illinois. Last year, an investigation by ProPublica and NPR found that the plans typically had lower benefits and more restrictions than workers’ comp. The story was part of a series on how states have been dismantling workers’ comp, which was designed a century ago to protect businesses from lawsuits while providing medical care and lost wages to workers who had been hurt on the job. Tuesday’s decision is the latest in a series of state Supreme Court rulings that have struck down several business-driven workers’ comp laws featured in the ProPublica and NPR investigation. The Florida Supreme Court struck down laws that placed strict caps on attorney fees and limited workers to two years of temporary disability pay regardless of whether they were able to return to work. Two-year caps have also been passed in California, North Dakota, Oklahoma, West Virginia and Texas. In addition, the top Oklahoma court in April overturned a provision that drastically cut compensation for workers who suffered permanently disabling injuries. Florida, New York and Tennessee have also significantly reduced benefits for such injuries in the past 13 years, but those provisions are still in place. Inside Corporate America’s Campaign to Ditch Workers’ Comp One Texas lawyer is helping companies opt out of workers’ compensation and write their own rules. What does it mean for injured workers? Read the story. The stories also prompted two groups — one of academics and one of workers’ comp regulators — to schedule separate forums later this month to discuss the various changes that have occurred and ways to improve workers’ comp. Oklahoma’s ruling leaves Texas as the only state that lets employers opt out of workers’ comp insurance. Bob Burke, a longtime workers’ comp attorney who has filed several successful challenges to Oklahoma’s new law, called opt out “the biggest attack on the American worker” since he started practicing law. Had the Supreme Court not acted, the Oklahoma opt-out law “would have deprived injured workers out of necessary surgeries and weekly benefits,” he said in an email. “Opt out also would have allowed companies to shift the cost of paying for work-related injuries to Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security.” Bill Minick, a Dallas lawyer whose company PartnerSource wrote most of the Oklahoma opt-out plans and about half of those in Texas, said in a statement that the ruling was specific to “Oklahoma’s unique constitution.” He vowed that his company and other supporters would continue their efforts to promote the alternative plans in other states. “We believe it’s critical to provide better care and benefits for injured workers, decrease the number of disputed claims and significantly decrease insurance premiums and claim costs for all employers,” he said. The Oklahoma case involved an employee at Dillard’s department store who injured her neck and shoulder while lifting shoeboxes in 2014. Dillard’s, which had opted out of workers’ comp and created its own benefit plan, initially paid for her medical care. But the company later denied her claims, insisting that any further damage and surgeries she might need were due to a preexisting degenerative condition and not her injury at work. In a 7–2 ruling, the justices found that such opt-out plans were unconstitutional because they treated one group of injured workers differently from all other injured workers in the state. In a concurring opinion, Justices Noma Gurich and Tom Colbert noted that while most Oklahoma workers have 30 days to report an injury and can request a hearing before a judge, Dillard’s employees had to report injuries by the end of the workday and could only appeal in writing to a committee made up of people picked by the company. The court sent the case back to the state’s workers’ comp commission to determine whether the injury was work-related and what benefits, if any, the woman should receive. Like this story?

News Peninsula stores fight for grocery dollars Hampton Roads grocery store market share rankings TidewaterBiz.com reports grocery rankings in our local area. TidewaterBiz.com reports grocery rankings in our local area. Tara BozickContact Reportertbozick@dailypress.com Who are the top grocers in Hampton Roads? Peninsula grocers are adapting to give customers what they expect — healthy, quality food at affordable prices — as Wal-Mart, Kroger and Whole Foods continue to grab more market share in the region. Of the total Hampton Roads market share, Food Lion remains the dominant grocer with Wal-Mart at No. 2 and Farm Fresh at No. 3, according to trade publication Food World's annual market study report. On a more local level, Food Lion is the favorite for Newport News, Hampton, Isle of Wight, Smithfield and Mathews while shoppers in James City and Williamsburg prefer Farm Fresh, according to the report. Wal-Mart dominates in Gloucester while the big-box retailer barely beats out Food Lion in York County. Food Lion remains the dominant grocer in Hampton Roads, according to trade publication Food World's annual market study report. Check out the full list. Regionwide, Food Lion dominates because it has the most stores with 78 to garner 17.8 percent of total market share, according to the report. Farm Fresh took a dip from 13.9 percent to 12.9 percent of total market share from 2015 to 2016. Wal-Mart, including its smaller Neighborhood Markets, had a slight increase in total market share from 14.8 percent to 14.9 percent from year to year. Other alternative grocers, including 7-Eleven, Wawa, Walgreens and Sam's Club, also gained ground with alternatives now representing 51.6 percent of the market, up from 51.2 percent in 2015. Military commissaries, which represent 10 percent of the Newport News and Hampton market share, saw a total regional market share dip from 4.9 percent in 2015 to 4.4 percent this year, according to the Food World report. Kroger's addition of Marketplace stores in Hampton Roads contributed to its increase in total market share from 4.76 percent to 4.84 percent, according to the Food World report.

Electric cars account for less than 1% of U.S. new car sales right now, but that number will most likely increase in the future. Hampton Roads is already a highly competitive market where price remains the primary driver with strong low-price influence from Wal-Mart and the commissaries, according to the report. And it's only going to get more competitive as discount retailers Aldi and Lidl plan to enter the market and as Kroger plans more stores on the Peninsula — in Denbigh and in the redevelopment of Riverdale Plaza in Hampton. Keep your eye on Food Lion's sustainability in Hampton Roads when German discount grocer Lidl starts entering the market in 2018 with nine stores planned so far in the region, including two in Newport News and one in Hampton, Food World Publisher Jeff Metzger said. The millennial generation, or the 18-34 age group, is driving a lot of change toward nutrition and wellness as well as convenience, Metzger said. That's why you see grocers adapting with better marketed organic and natural food sections and a better selection of prepared food or ready-to-cook items. Over the years, Hampton Roads' changing demographics has led to households with more disposable income, demanding higher end stores and selection, Metzger said. Whole Foods is the case in point in Newport News, where Mid-Atlantic favorite Wegmans also had its eye. Grocers are also adding improved private-label products, which could appeal to those who aren't as brand loyal, Metzger said. What grocery store chain is the Peninsula still missing? Do you want to see a Wegman's? A Publix? Here's a partial look at missing supermarkets. For instance, Food Lion recently took its premium-tier Taste of Inspirations deli line companywide, said Wanda Marshburn, Food Lion director of operations for 25 stores in the Newport News-Hampton region. Salisbury, N.C.-based Food Lion, which is part of the Ahold Delhaize group, continues to invest to keep low prices on staple items and has been enhancing stores to showcase its fresh produce and natural and organic items, Marshburn said. Food Lion makes buying natural or premium products more affordable with its own brands, including its own wine, she added. Food Lion also remains strong because of its convenient neighborhood locations and dedicated employees, Marshburn said. Farm Fresh has been remodeling stores on the Peninsula to modernize the shopping experience, said Dave Huettl, vice president of sales and merchandising. From 2014 to the end of 2016, Farm Fresh will have remodeled 18 of its 41 stores in Hampton Roads, including seven of 12 Peninsula stores. Much of those renovations have focused on highlighting its fresh products in addition to revamping the deli, bakery and seafood departments, Huettl said. (Judith Lowery) Throughout the store, Farm Fresh is allocating more space to capture customer trends for healthier options, including organic and gluten-free items, and its chef-to-go items to make it easier for folks who want to cook gourmet-style meals at home, Huettl said. The company is also adding more items to the Wild Harvest line. "We try to give you a convenient meal solution regardless of the size of your family," Huettl said. Farm Fresh finds more folks want healthier meal options and transparency in labeling, he said. Still, Virginia Beach-based Farm Fresh, a subsidiary of Minnesota's SuperValu, might appeal to millennials who are focused on the local community. "Being in the area, we're always trying to highlight who's local, what's local in our weekly ads in the store," Huettl said. While Cincinnati-based The Kroger Co. and its Village Square at Kiln Creek shopping center store compete well on price, the biggest change the company has seen during the past five years has been the customer emphasis on convenience, spokeswoman Noelle Motley said in an email. That's why the company is rolling out its ClickList online ordering service at stores in South Hampton Roads this year. Kroger now operates 10 stores in the region, including four Marketplace stores that sell home decor, bed and bath items and small appliances. The new Marketplaces and providing items customers ask for, such as natural and organic foods, local produce and craft products, have helped Kroger's regional uptick in sales, Motley said. Millennials also like the digital coupon savings and prepared foods. Harris Teeter has been able benefit from its January 2014 merger with The Kroger Co. to pass savings on to shoppers with lower prices on thousands of products, said spokeswoman Lea Ramsey. Harris Teeter's market share in Hampton Roads grew from 6.08 percent to 6.15 percent, according to Food World. The grocer also prides itself on its quality products, extensive selection, clean stores, friendly staff and promotions. The Fresh Market, which saw its regional market share increase from 1.06 percent to 1.29 percent, had already been providing shoppers easy grab-and-go options for preparing a home-cooked meal, said spokeswoman Stephanie Lowder. The "Little Big Meal" program changes meals each week. Food World's market analysis is based on information collected from April 1, 2015, through March 31, 2016.

READ MORE READ MORE READ MORE Share Kate Taylor Sep 13th 2016 2:41PM Walmart just patented a system based on mini-robots that can control shopping carts, as well as complete a long list of duties once reserved for human employees. Last week, Walmart was granted a patent for a new system that allows shopping carts to drive themselves, untouched by customers and employees. However, the system goes far beyond self-driving carts, with details on automated devices that can do much of the work a human employees would do. According to the patent, "motorized transport units" are tools that attach to shopping carts, allowing the carts to drive freely around the store, be summoned to customers, and move safely into docks instead of clogging up parking lots. The system uses a combination of sensors, video cameras, a wireless network, and a central computer. Thomson Reuters But, Walmart's plans are bigger than cleaning up carts more efficiently. These motorized units can also potentially move containers; scan, retrieve, and deliver products; check inventory; retrieve trash; and even connect with customers. And, the patent says that Walmart is not limiting what else the motorized units can be configured to do. While the patent describes the motorized unit's role as enhancing a shopping experience and assisting customers or employees, the new tech could be bad news for Walmart employees.

More than 200 violent crimes have been committed so far this year at Walmart locations across the US, with Bloomberg arguing that the rise in crime is linked to the retailer understaffing stores. Cost-cutting policies that started in the early 2000s resulted in a drop in store quality, while the loss of greeters and the rise of self-checkout scanners made shoplifting and other illegal activities easier to engage in without employees noticing. The patent's authors argue that the new, tech-heavy system could improve customers' in-store experience and solve problems that Walmart employees cannot. Thomson Reuters "In a modern retail store environment, there is a need to improve the customer experience and/or convenience for the customer," reads the patent's background section, which notes issues including insufficient employees in peak hours, under-trained workers due to high-turnover rate, messy aisles, and theft. "All of these issues can result in low customer satisfaction or reduced convenience to the customer," the patent continues. "With increasing competition from non-traditional shopping mechanisms, such as online shopping provided by e-commerce merchants and alternative store formats, it can be important for 'brick and mortar' retailers to focus on improving the overall customer experience and/or convenience." Further, the benefits of a more-fully automated store are particularly appealing for retailers as labor costs rise, according to analysts. While Walmart CEO Doug McMillon announced $2.7 billion in spending on wages and training last year, labor activists argue that the retailer still underpays employees and continue to call for higher pay. Walmart did not respond to Business Insider's request to comment, and has not provided any information regarding if or when the new system would roll out in stores. With robots that can drive shopping carts and preform a wide array of other employee duties, Walmart could cut the number of employees on payroll while also improving customer experience. Automation is already taking over the fast-food industry — and it looks like the budget retail business might be next. NOW WATCH: We tested Walmart's ice-cream sandwiches, which supposedly don't melt, and were mystified by the results 9 ways to save money at Walmart: 10 PHOTOS 9 secret ways to save money at Walmart See Gallery 9 secret ways to save money at Walmart 1. Take Advantage of Walmart's Price Matching Policy  Even if Walmart isn’t offering the lowest price on a given item, you can take advantage of the store’s price match policy to secure a better deal. Walmart will match any advertised price from stores in your area, said Paul Ivanovsky, creator of IHeartTheMart.com, a blog dedicated to saving money at Walmart. To qualify, the items in question must be identical and in stock at the other retailer. According to Ivanovsky, the price matching policy is a great way to save money on items such as fruit, meat and paper products. Additionally, Walmart will match many online competitors’ prices for home goods and other non-food items. While restrictions exist, the retail giant will generally match prices for goods from Amazon.com, BestBuy.com, Target.com and TigerDirect.com, among other stores. Photo credit: vvoe/Shutterstock.com 2. Get Online Prices in the Store Before you make a purchase in one of its stores, see if Walmart is offering a better price online, as the company will match Walmart.com prices for in-store purchases. Bethany Halford, co-creator of the Whoa, Wait. Walmart? blog that features great finds at Walmart, said she frequently finds items that have been marked down online but not in the stores. To get the better price, she pulls the item up on her phone and shows it to the cashier when she checks out. Recently, Halford saved a couple dollars when she found a pair of slippers selling for $12.88 in the store and about $10 online. Photo credit: iStock.com/Larry Herfindal 3. Use the Savings Catcher App If you forgot to check other stores’ prices before shopping at Walmart, you still can take advantage of the retailer’s price match policy after the fact by using the Savings Catcher app. After scanning your receipt with the app, you can compare the prices you paid with local competitors’ advertised rates, Ivanovsky said. If an item you bought is cheaper elsewhere, you will be credited the difference in the form of Savings Catcher Rewards Dollars, which can be redeemed for a Walmart gift card or Walmart Buck$ to be added to a Bluebird by American Express Card prepaid debit card. “Even if you don’t think you bought something that can be matched, you might be surprised at what the Savings Catcher finds for you,” said Dian Farmer of GroceryShopForFree.com. Photo credit: iStock.com/LDProd 4. Get Free Shipping From Walmart.com Shipping costs can quickly negate the savings you might accumulate by shopping online. However, there are two ways you can get free shipping from Walmart.com. If you spend $50 or more online, Walmart will ship your purchases for free, Halford said. While there’s a flat $4.97 shipping fee for orders less than $50, shoppers can get around that fee by having online purchases shipped to their local stores, said Amanda Jerkins, the other co-creator of Whoa, Wait. Walmart? It’s important to note that perishable products, hazardous materials and items weighing more than 350 pounds aren’t eligible for free store pickup. With many other items, though, you can pick them up the same day you order them online. Photo credit: chrisdorney/Shutterstock.com 5. Comb Through the Clearance Racks If you rush through your Walmart trips, you might miss out on some of the retailer’s best clearance deals. Typically, deeply discounted items are placed in an aisle near the toy or lawn and garden department, Halford said. When she and Jerkins comb through the clearance racks, they often find that items they were coveting at full price are now on sale for much less. For example, Jerkins said she recently found a floor lamp she wanted that was marked down from $45 to $20 in the clearance section. She also recommends checking the end caps on aisles throughout the store for heavily discounted items. Photo credit: Kzenon/Shutterstock.com 6. Shop Early in the Morning for Grocery Deals If your local Walmart has a grocery department, you can save money by timing your food shopping trips right. Farmer recommends shopping early in the morning to score discounts on one of the priciest food items on your list — meat. “Normally, by 8 a.m., the meat department has discounted their meat, and you can grab some great deals,” she said. Photo credit: iStock.com/Steve Debenport 7. Tap Into Seasonal Savings Walmart is known for offering great Black Friday sales. In fact, DealNews.com found that it was among the top five retailers with the best deals on Black Friday and the entire week of Thanksgiving. However, there are other times of the year when retailers offers savings, as well. In particular, July has become a season for merchants to promote Black Friday-like deals, said Slickdeals.net consumer expert Regina Conway. In July of 2015, Walmart hosted a big sale to rival Amazon’s one-day sale for its Prime members, who pay a $99 annual fee for free two-day shipping and other benefits. Amazon has already announced plans to hold the event again, and Conway anticipates that Walmart will do the same. As an added bonus, Walmart doesn’t require any sort of membership fee to take advantage of its deals. Photo credit: txking/Shutterstock.com 8. Get $1 Deals Some of the items you can find at a dollar store can also be purchased at Walmart for $1 or less — and you don’t even have to ask for price matching. For example, Walmart sells personal grooming products such as deodorant and shampoo for about $1.

 Target's biggest problem isn't a customer boycott Hayley Peterson Sep. 13, 2016, 2:29 PM 45,327 facebook linkedin twitter email print Target is losing customers to Walmart and Amazon. Associated Press Target is losing customers to Walmart and Amazon, according to new research. The retailer recently revealed that shopper traffic is declining for the first time in years. The decline immediately followed the start of a boycott against Target for its policy welcoming transgender customers to use any bathroom or fitting room that matches their gender identity. But Cowen & Co. analysts say the real reason shoppers are abandoning Target is because they can find better prices and more convenience elsewhere. According to the analysts, Target is losing the business of shoppers who visited the retailer for "fill-in" trips — or quick stops to get a small amount of items between larger "stock-up" trips. Shoppers are cutting down on these "fill-in" trips to Target because they are finding cheaper prices at Walmart and more convenience with Amazon Prime, according to data compiled by Cowen & Co. "Amazon is seeing explosive growth in several categories most notably grocery and consumables, which accounts for 45-50% of Target's business and are likely the categories feeling pressure from the 'fill-in' trip dynamics," the analysts wrote in a research note published Monday. "In our view, Walmart can use its scale to compete on price to regain or maintain market share vs. Amazon... but Target cannot compete as easily." Joe Raedle / Getty Target's same-store transactions, which is how traffic is measured, fell 2.2% in the second quarter. Overall, sales fell 7.2% to $16.2 billion. "In the second quarter, our No. 1 challenge was traffic, which affected sales in all of our merchandise categories," Target CEO Brian Cornell said last week on a call with analysts. Target is planning to overhaul its grocery department to better compete with its rivals, but analysts say the changes will take too long to accomplish. "The food section is facing increasing competition from Walmart's price investments as well as added convenience features at some competitors, such as online grocery pickup and expanded service offerings." Walmart, Kroger, Harris Teeter, Giant Food, and other chains have started offering online grocery pickup, meaning customers can order their groceries online and pick them up at a nearby store. Analysts said Target will have to drop prices in its grocery department to stop losing customers to Walmart.

Pitting the two successful national retailers against each other as stock investments. Demitrios Kalogeropoulos (TMFSigma) Sep 13, 2016 at 2:18PM Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) and Lowe's (NYSE:LOW) have two of the most stable retailing businesses in the stock market. In fact, both companies have raised their dividend payout for over 20 consecutive years. Wal-Mart's chief grocery rival, Kroger (NYSE:KR), can't claim the same stellar track record. Neither can Lowe's main competition, Home Depot (NYSE:HD). Today, I'm taking a closer look at these two dividend aristocrats to see which one would make a better buy for investors right now. Here are a few key statistics to get us started: Metric Wal-Mart Lowe's Market cap $217 billion $62.7 billion Sales growth 1% 5% Gross profit margin 25% 35% Dividend yield 2.8% 1.9% Price to sales 0.5 1 Forward price to earnings 16 18 Sales growth is for the past complete fiscal year and excludes fuel sales and exchange rate changes. Data sources: Company financial filings and S&P Global Market Intelligence. Operating wins: Wal-Mart Wal-Mart's operating trends are improving with respect to both its past stumbles and industry rivals. The retailing titan just posted its sixth consecutive quarter of positive comparable-store sales. Comps improved by 1.4% last quarter, which bested Target's (NYSE:TGT) 1% decline and marked an acceleration over the prior quarter's 0.8% boost. The company even managed to fight to a near draw against Kroger, which has been poaching away market share from Wal-Mart's grocery business for over a decade. Image source: Wal-Mart.  Lowe's, meanwhile, is enjoying higher absolute sales gains but is also struggling against the competition. The home improvement retailer's latest 2% comps figure was far from the 5% that Home Depot managed. At the same time, Lowe's continues to lag its bigger rival in the key metrics of profitability and cash flow. Overall then, Wal-Mart wins this round since it is executing better against peers. Cash Returns: Wal-Mart Income investors will find more reasons to prefer Wal-Mart over Lowe's today. Not only do shares come with a higher dividend yield (2.8% vs. 1.9%), but the retailing giant has demonstrated a stronger commitment to sending cash back to its shareholders. Wal-Mart spent over $6 billion on dividends last year, compared to $4 billion on stock repurchases. Lowe's, in contrast, dedicated the vast majority of its cash returns to stock buybacks. Wal-Mart also delivers a higher percentage of earnings to investors as dividends. While Lowe's aims to return just 35% of profits each year, Wal-Mart's payout ratio is climbing toward 50%. WMT PS Ratio (TTM) data by YCharts. Round two goes to the king of retail. Growth outlook: Lowe's A bright outlook for their industry has Lowe's executives feeling confident right now. After all, the home improvement market has strong fundamentals, including housing formation and home prices, that point to years of continued above-average growth. Image source: Getty Images. Lowe's executives frequently cite that "favorable macroeconomic backdrop" as a key reason that customer traffic keeps trending higher. Home Depot's management agrees, and the CEO recently told investors, "We continue to see positive signs in the housing data which we believe serve as a tailwind for our business." Wal-Mart, in contrast, is fighting to post even nominal growth in a sluggish industry that executives of Target and other retailers have called "challenging." That weakness is especially true on the grocery side of the business, where price deflation is tripping up most market participants. Kroger, for example, just posted its worst expansion pace in years and projected soft growth for the rest of the 2016 and into 2017. Give this round to Lowe's. Why Lowe's wins The stock valuations of these two retailers appear to reflect their different growth and profit profiles, as Lowe's is more expensive on both a price-to-sales and price-to-earnings basis. Still, that's a justifiable premium, in my view, given the retailer's faster, more profitable growth. There's clearly room for more gains, too, given how quickly Home Depot is expanding right now. Lowe's key challenge will be to close the gap with its key rival, which is an admittedly tough feat. Lowe's might even be preferable over Wal-Mart for income investors. Yes, its payout is lower right now. However, that is understandable, given that it needs cash for major growth initiatives like boosting its store base. And ultimately, steady housing market gains could help produce faster dividend growth over the coming decade. Demitrios Kalogeropoulos owns shares of Home Depot.

 Walmart is patenting technology that could have terrifying implications for workers Kate Taylor Sep. 13, 2016, 1:38 PM 9,354 facebook linkedin twitter email print Thomson Reuters Walmart just patented a system based on mini-robots that can control shopping carts, as well as complete a long list of duties once reserved for human employees.  Last week, Walmart was granted a patent for a new system that allows shopping carts to drive themselves, untouched by customers and employees. However, the system goes far beyond self-driving carts, with details on automated devices that can do much of the work a human employees would do.  According to the patent, "motorized transport units" are tools that attach to shopping carts, allowing the carts to drive freely around the store, be summoned to customers, and move safely into docks instead of clogging up parking lots. The system uses a combination of sensors, video cameras, a wireless network, and a central computer.  Shopping carts with the motorized transport units attached at the bottom. US Patent and Trademark Office But, Walmart's plans are bigger than cleaning up carts more efficiently. These motorized units can also potentially move containers; scan, retrieve, and deliver products; check inventory; retrieve trash; and even connect with customers. And, the patent says that Walmart is not limiting what else the motorized units can be configured to do.  "Walmart was able to revolutionize retail using technology to better serve customers," Walmart spokesperson Lorenzo Lopez told Business Insider. "And as the retail landscape continues to evolve, we want to be able to serve customers when and how they want to shop. That means testing new and innovative ways to serve the customer, which we’ve done through different initiatives like our grocery pickup service." While the patent describes the motorized unit's role as enhancing a shopping experience and assisting customers or employees, the new tech could be bad news for Walmart employees.  Walmart has come under fire for a number of issues with staffing and employees in recent months.  More than 200 violent crimes have been committed so far this year at Walmart locations across the US, with Bloomberg arguing that the rise in crime is linked to the retailer understaffing stores. Cost-cutting policies that started in the early 2000s resulted in a drop in store quality, while the loss of greeters and the rise of self-checkout scanners made shoplifting and other illegal activities easier to engage in without employees noticing. The patent's authors argue that the new, tech-heavy system could improve customers' in-store experience and solve problems that Walmart employees cannot.  Joe Raedle/Getty Images "In a modern retail store environment, there is a need to improve the customer experience and/or convenience for the customer," reads the patent's background section, which notes issues including insufficient employees in peak hours, under-trained workers due to high-turnover rate, messy aisles, and theft. "All of these issues can result in low customer satisfaction or reduced convenience to the customer," the patent continues. "With increasing competition from non-traditional shopping mechanisms, such as online shopping provided by e-commerce merchants and alternative store formats, it can be important for 'brick and mortar' retailers to focus on improving the overall customer experience and/or convenience." Further, the benefits of a more-fully automated store are particularly appealing for retailers as labor costs rise, according to analysts.  While Walmart CEO Doug McMillon announced $2.7 billion in spending on wages and training last year, labor activists argue that the retailer still underpays employees and continue to call for higher pay. "While it's too early to determine how we would even potentially use this technology, our goal always is to find ways to help simplify processes to help our associates better serve our customers as they will continue to play a critical role in the success of our business," Lopez told Business Insider. Walmart has not provided any specific information regarding if or when the new system would roll out in stores.  With robots that can drive shopping carts and preform a wide array of other employee duties, Walmart could cut the number of employees on payroll while also improving customer experience. Automation is already taking over the fast-food industry — and it looks like the budget retail business might be next.  Disclosure: Jeff Bezos is an investor in Business Insider through his personal investment company Bezos Expeditions.

Wal-Mart's robotic shopping carts will help you buy even more stuff Money 9/13/2016 Kaitlin Mulhere Walmart shoppers may soon be able to hail a self-driving shopping cart much like they’d hail a taxi with their smartphone. The mega-retailer has filed a patent for a cart that has a motor and video cameras, describing a cart that will drive itself to customers and even help them track down items in the store. CNN Money reports that the patent filing also says the system will be able to identify unattended carts in the parking lot and return them to a docking station, potentially saving you the headache of hunting down a prime parking spot only to find that some careless shopper left their cart in the middle of it. (Or if you’re more of a glass half-empty person, this further demonstrates all the ways robots will take our jobs—by eliminating the need for an employee to collect carts in the parking lot.) Walmart’s confirms what onlookers have suspected since June, when Five Elements Robotics announced at the Bloomberg Technology Conference that it was working with Walmart to design robotic shopping carts that would help shoppers find items on their list and automatically drive through the store and parking lot. Bloomberg reported described it as an opportunity for “brick-and-mortar stores look for innovative ways to match the convenience of Amazon.com Inc.” Walmart hasn’t commented on its robotic scheme, but this isn’t the only way the retailer is experimenting with technology. The company has implemented technology for customers inside stores to scan and purchase items on their mobile phone to avoid the check out line. Last year, Walmart also announced it wanted to use drones for delivery and warehouse operations, in much the same way as has started using robots and drones. ]]> Go to MSN Home More in Money 12 leaders who took $1 salaries Money What Trump's win could mean for older Americans CBS News 30 things you should never buy without a coupon GOBankingRates 6 brand mascots that actually existed in real life Business Insider 20 tips for saving money at the grocery store U.S. News & World Report - Money Amazing Airstreams: The coolest tiny homes on wheels Lovemoney Up Next 15 of the biggest business disasters of all time Lovemoney AdChoices AdChoices AdChoices More from Money Can Trump Make Coal Great Again?

We put three stores to the test. Thomas Hawthorne/azcentral.com Birthday cake is a big business, and Valley grocers are vying for a slice. The Food & Dining team wondered which grocery store bakery makes the best cake, Walmart, Fry's or Whole Foods? Charlotte Rough, 3, and her brother, Scott Rough, 6, taste test sheet cake. (Photo: David Wallace/The Republic) Julia Child said, “A party without cake is just a meeting.” Indeed, a slice of baked batter topped with frosting is a requisite piece of any celebration, from a birthday bash to an office occasion. Grocers are keen to be part of America’s parties. Many are investing in their in-store bakeries, both as a way to appear fresh in the eyes of consumers and as a means to keep you in their aisles. Buying a cake from a baker instead of a cooler case adds value to the shopping experience. And bakeries add to grocers’ bottom line. Americans spent $13.5 billion on in-store bakery products in 2015, according to Progressive Grocer’s 2016 Retail Bakery Review. The Republic's Food & Dining team wondered which grocery store bakery makes the best cake, so we hosted a taste test of sheet cakes.

In its latest quarterly earnings report, released on Aug. 16, Walmart’s total revenue was $120.9 billion. Fry's Food Stores Fry's Food Stores of Arizona is based in Tolleson and operates as a subsidiary of the Kroger Co. Last year, Kroger reported $109.8 billion in total sales, with 23 percent of that as perishable products including produce, deli and bakery. Whole Foods Market Whole Foods Market cakes are made using cage-free eggs and do not have artificial colors, flavors, sweeteners, preservatives or hydrogenated fats. Prepared foods and bakery accounted for nearly a fifth of the “values matter” company’s $15.4 billion in annual sales in 2015.

Arizona Republic reporters Kaila White (L) and Weldon Johnson (R) taste test sheet cake.  (Photo: David Wallace/The Republic) THE TASTING This was a blind taste test. Tasters were asked to rate the store’s offerings based on appearance and taste on a scale of 1 (hated it) to 4 (great). While this was not a scientific taste test using hundreds of participants, we did our best to ensure a fair playing field by ordering the same types of cakes from each locale, and took steps to ensure that no one cake sat longer than the others or was uncovered. We purchased white/vanilla and chocolate quarter sheet cakes from each store on a weekday morning. All six cakes have the same serving size, 12-15 slices.  We chose stores that didn’t require memberships. We placed orders for each cake over the phone about 48 hours prior to pickup. The Walmart and Fry's frosting was buttercream. The Whole Foods cakes had whipped topping because we were told that was the only option. THE RESULTS Walmart edged out the competition and won both the white and chocolate cake categories. Whole Foods cakes tasted the most “homemade,” judges said, though not all agreed that was an advantage.

Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr Even better, there’s good case to be made that there’s much more upside to go. Shares are up more than 15% for the year-to-date and sentiment is improving by the day. On Monday analysts at Cowen & Co. lifted their recommendation on WMT stock to “outperform” (buy, essentially) from “market perform” (neutral), citing a number of sustainable factors. According to Cowen’s own proprietary data, higher wages and better training are making a dent. Employees more helpful and the stores look better. Strength in critical retail metrics in the most recent quarter further burnish the shine on Walmart stock. 10 Growth Stocks That Will Outrun Google It also doesn’t hurt that its biggest rival has made some missteps. From Cowen’s note to clients: “We’re confident WMT’s positive US traffic (7 straight quarters) should continue over the next 2 years as WMT makes more aggressive price investments and makes further improvements in the customer experience. WMT’s impressive 2Q results of US comps of +1.6% driven by traffic of +1.2% demonstrated that the retailer is taking share at the expense of TGT, dollar stores, and grocers. The investments in wages/training from the last 2 years have elevated the store experience, as highlighted by customer satisfaction scores for the total shopping experience (76% of respondents) and customer service (63% of respondents) at 2-year high’s in our proprietary consumer survey.” Is WMT on a Retail Roll? Importantly, the story doesn’t end there. Hewing to its “always low prices” ethos, price rollbacks in the grocery category are helping to make WMT more popular with supermarket shoppers. Cowen also takes pains to remind investors that WMT is only a third of the way finished with its two-year program to make stores more desirable places for consumers. It’s a compelling argument, but one part is a little harder to swallow. Walmart is making effort to get e-commerce growing but progress has been painfully slow. Part of the bear argument against Walmart stock is, of course, the existence of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). The acquisition of Jet — an e-commerce site that skews younger and more urban — is intended to help WMT’s demographics. Too bad corporate efforts at cool never seem to work. The key point on Walmart is that it is successfully addressing the things that were bringing the company — and WMT stock — down. Shabby stores or messily stocked shelves are a huge turnoff for shoppers. Just ask anyone who did back-to-school shopping at Sears Holdings Corporation (NASDAQ:SHLD) this year. Shares are outperforming the S&P 500 by a wide margin so far in 2016. However, they’ve recently plateaued. Part of the sluggishness can probably be blamed on September being the worst month for market performance. That doesn’t mean you can dismiss the doubters. Cowen’s more optimistic view is in the minority on Wall Street. Of the 27 analysts covering the stock, five have it at buy, three call it a sell and 19 say it’s a hold, according to a survey by Thomson Reuters. Cowen’s target price of $83 — up from $76 — is also on the rosy side. Starbucks Corporation: Can SBUX Stock Escape This Bad Brew? Analysts’ average price target comes to $73 and change in the next year or so. The stock is currently trading between $71 and $72. Bottom Line By Cowen’s reckoning, the market is under-appreciating the effects of Walmart’s rejuvenation efforts and underestimating how much more progress is to come. The market is less sure, but recent strength in all the right areas suggests WMT stock will reap more upside for its efforts. As of this writing, Dan Burrows did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

NEW DELHI: US retail giant Walmart is still evaluating India's policy of allowing 100% foreign investment in food retail even as not allowing any non-food item makes it tough to create a competitive model, Walmart India CEO Krish Iyer has said. "It would have been nice to see a little of non-food being allowed, not purely from the point of view of economics, which is important, but also from the point of view of the consumer because the consumer who comes to the stores for food and grocery, is wanting to shop everything under one roof.... The missing non-food does cause a little problem in terms of creating the right model and also competing with the domestic retailers because it doesn't provide a level plane," Iyer said on Tuesday. He said the company is working on tackling this challenge, and will conceptualise the model. "We assure you we are in the country for a really long time, and my CEO says we are in India for the next 100 years, so we will take all the right steps and make sure that there is no step which is taken backwards," Iyer said at a conference on FDI in marketing of food products and promotion of exports organised jointly by CII and the ministry of food processing. Walmart India has introduced ecommerce in its business and plans to go pan-india with the cash and carry concept. "We will increase the participation of food in our cash and carry business because if we are able to persuade our e-sellers, to buy more of their food requirements, we will start making a difference soon, without having to wait for opening our retail formats," Iyer said. "I think what is being done in the food processing sector is going to be revolutionary for the country. It is going to be revolutionary for the farmers, consumers because the prices of essential commodities will stabilise once all this starts taking effect," he said. Walmart currently has 21 cash & carry stores and has committed 50 stores in five years. Stay on top of business news with The Economic Times App. Download it Now!

An analyst shifts gears on the two leading discounters. Rick Munarriz (TMFBreakerRick) Sep 13, 2016 at 9:07AM Even Target's autumn home decor collection seems to know which way the stock's been heading lately. Image source: Target. We're more than two months away from the holiday shopping season, but at least one Wall Street pro is making changes to his wish list. Cowen analyst Oliver Chen is reshuffling his ratings on the country's two leading discount department store chains. He's lowering his rating on Target (NYSE:TGT) from outperform to market perform. At the same time he's boosting his call on Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) from market perform to outperform. Switcheroos don't happen often. Analysts often sour or get bullish on entire industries, but that's not the case here. Chen feels that Target's losing market share, in part, to Wal-Mart.  Target has posted year-over-year declines for three consecutive quarters and the shortfalls are accelerating. Comparable-store sales are negative, and Chen feels that recent initiatives to beef up its grocery and pharmacy offerings aren't resonating with shoppers. Chen singles out the decline in fill-in traffic, customers that come in to grab just an item or two on the fly. Whether those lost customers are turning to Wal-Mart or online retailers, the point is that they're not doing it at Target.  Chen is no longer bullish on Target. He's slashing his price target on the "cheap chic" retailer from $75 to $68. Sam Walton would be proud If Target is losing share to Wal-Mart and online retailers, it's probably a good thing that Wal-Mart is acquiring Jet.com to gain some more skin in the dot-com game. That's just one of the reasons why Cowen's Chen turned bullish on the world's largest retailer yesterday.  Sales at Wal-Mart are holding up better than at Target. U.S. comps have been positive for eight consecutive quarters, and traffic is also on the rise. Chen feels that we're still in the early innings of Wal-Mart's revival. The chain's investments in training and higher wages are elevating the shopping experience, resulting in two-year highs in customer satisfaction surveys. Perhaps more important for Wal-Mart's reputation as a shrewd provider of roll-back pricing, the extra investments in its workforce haven't gotten in the way of its aggressive pricing on merchandise. Chen is boosting his price target on Wal-Mart stock from $76 to $83. When did Target stop being cool? It's easy to pin the blame on the data breach during the 2013 holiday shopping season. It ultimately settled two years later, but exposing roughly 40 million credit and debit card accounts isn't something that "Tar-zhay" has been able to overcome.  Yield chasers may gravitate to Target's 3.5% payout, beefier than Wal-Mart's still-impressive 2.8% rate. However, Wal-Mart's the one with momentum clearly in its corner for a change. Shoppers see it, and now another analyst does, too.   Rick Munarriz has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Fri, Nov 18, 2016, 15:04 GMT - UK Markets close in 1 hr 26 mins UK Grocer Morrisons On Cusp Of Quiet Revolution, But Doubts RemainReuters - UK Focus – Tue, Sep 13, 2016 07:00 BST Share 0 Tweet 0 Share0 Print Shopping trolleys are parked at a Morrisons supermarket in south London, Britain August 19, 2016. Picture taken … Eighteen months after Chief Executive David Potts took over, the retailer is on course to return to profit growth this yearafter four years of falls caused largely by the rapid advance of German discounters Aldi and Lidl. That would put Morrisons, the fourth-largest supermarketgroup, on a par with market leader Tesco, which is expected to post a small rise, and ahead of second-biggestplayer Sainsbury which is set to post another fall. Analysts forecast Morrisons will report underlying pretaxprofit of 150 million pounds ($200 million) for the first halfof the year on Thursday, up from 141 million in the same periodof 2015. But Potts has yet to win over the doubters. Shares in the firm, which is based in the northern English city of Bradford, have risen 17 percent in the last year but remain a little below 204 pence, where they were when he joined on March 16, 2015. Over 60 percent of analysts rate the stock as "underperform". Morrisons is still losing market share but this is due to Potts's decision to close about 30 stores and sell a loss-making local convenience chain. On the measure of sales at stores openfor over a year, he has made significant progress. The firm has reported two consecutive quarters oflike-for-like sales growth, is expected to report a third on Thursday and given current forecasts is likely to be thestrongest of the big four, which also includes Wal-Mart's Asda, on that measure over the first half. There is also some evidence that the group may be in astronger position than its peers to cope with the consequencesof Britain's vote to leave the European Union. More tangibly, two deals with Amazon and Ocado to sell Morrisons products online could also boost profit. PATRIARCH Ken Morrison, the firm's boss for half a century and stillits Life President, gives what by his standards is a ringing endorsement of Potts. "I think he's doing very well, but there'sstill a lot of room for improvement," the 84-year-old son of thecompany's founder told Reuters. By contrast, the patriarch of a family that still ownsalmost 10 percent of the group once described the strategypursued by Potts's predecessor Dalton Philips as "bullshit". Potts, 59, joined Morrisons after 39 years with Tesco wherehe began by stacking shelves. His initial task was to steady theship after the group lost ground in its traditional northernmarket under Philips. Potts has slashed prices, narrowing the gap with thediscounters. He has replenished shelves more rapidly, tailored products to local tastes and improved service with, for example, more self-scan and express checkouts. Analysts say he has also improved the look and condition ofthe group's 492 stores and sharpened up marketing, emphasising its army of more than 9,000 trained butchers, bakers,fishmongers and other specialists who prepare more food in-storethan in other British supermarkets. The changes appear popular. Like-for-like transactions wereup 3.1 percent in the first quarter, with sales volume growth up 3.3 percent. Analysts at Jefferies International, who have a 'buy' ratingon the stock, say the firm is misunderstood. "Rarely have we seen such a negative combination of viewsboth from investors and sell siders," they said, noting thatabout 21 percent of Morrisons' freefloat stock is on loan forshort-selling by investors who expect the price to fall. NAYSAYERS Naysayers highlight the intensely competitive nature of theBritish grocery market, saying Potts needs to go even further onprice cuts, and fear a fight back by industry laggard Asda, theBritish arm of U.S. giant Wal-Mart. Morrisons has invested heavily in food production andpacking and now has 14 plants, making it Britain's secondbiggest food manufacturer and most integrated food retailer. While data is sparse, Morrisons says it imports less of thefood it sells than the 40 percent industry average. This would make it less exposed than rivals to the pound'sfall of 9 percent against the euro and 11 percent against thedollar after Britons opted for Brexit. Potts has cut pricestwice since the referendum on June 23. Morrisons also has a very small non-food offer, shunning thetrend of other big supermarkets which sell everything from coffee makers to washing machines and TVs. With many of thosegoods imported, here too Morrisons is less exposed to thecurrency swings. It is also less exposed to the risk of a post-Brexit economic slowdown and a resulting drop in consumer confidence which would particularly damage demand for bigger purchases. Such a slowdown has yet to materialise but remains expected bymany economists. Phoenix Asset Management, which owns nearly 1 percent of Morrisons according to Reuters data, has estimated the firm'sfood production capacity has grown to about three times the sizeit was a decade ago. However, it says productivity, or volumegrowth, has not kept track, meaning it has scope to raise output. A wholesale supply deal struck by Potts with U.S. onlinegiant Amazon in February gives Morrisons the opportunity toincrease volume with little additional capital expenditure,boosting profitability. Amazon's own assault on the UK grocery market is focused onLondon, where Morrisons is weak and has little share to lose butwhere Tesco and Sainsbury's are strong. Morrisons is also benefiting from its own belated moveonline through a partnership with Ocado, a deal that Potts re-negotiated, paying less upfront and holding on to moreprofit. It also wants to expand the wholesale of its own-label foodsthrough an alliance with Motor Fuel Group (MFG) Britain's secondlargest independent forecourt operator. BALANCE SHEET STRENGTH Morrisons has significantly strengthened its balance sheet,with net debt forecast to be as low as 1.4 billion pounds ($1.86billion) by the end of its 2016-17 year, down from a peak of2.82 billion pounds in 2014. Clive Black, analyst at the group's broker Shore Capital,says Morrisons stands apart with a lease-adjusted netdebt/earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisationand rent (EBITDAR) ratio of 2.4 times. This compares with aforecast of 3.9 times for Sainsbury and 4.6 times for Tesco. Black said that if trading remains sound and debt reduction continues, Morrisons may be able to consider something to please shareholders, such as a share buyback, over the next 18 months.   Share 0 Tweet 0 Share0 Print 'How I positioned my £1.6bn portfolio for higher inflation' Telegraph - 22 minutes ago 'How I positioned my £1.6bn portfolio for higher inflation' … More » - Sponsored  The last thing UK insurers need is more strangulating regulation Telegraph - 1 hour 13 minutes ago The last thing UK insurers need is more strangulating regulation … More » Volkswagen is spiking 30,000 jobs as part of a huge restructuring programme Business Insider UK Finance - 6 hours ago The German carmaker Volkswagen is axing about 30,000 jobs over the next five years as part of a huge restructuring programme.

Aldi coming to Stuart; Walmart Neighborhood Markets planned for Port St. Lucie, Vero Beach Kelly Tyko , kelly.tyko@tcpalm.com 6:13 p.m. EDT September 12, 2016 The grand opening for the new Aldi at 3937 S.E. U.S. 1 is Sept. 15. The first 100 shoppers will receive store gift certificates, free reusable bags, samples and entry in a contest to win free produce for a year. (Photo: KELLY TYKO/TREASURE COAST NEWSPAPERS) CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Just because a store is small, doesn’t mean you can’t save big. I’ve found this to be the case at the Treasure Coast’s new wave of smaller grocery stores, especially no-frills discount grocery retailer Aldi. The German grocer opens its third store here Thursday in Stuart at the southeast corner of U.S. 1 and Southeast Miami Avenue near the Wal-Mart Supercenter. Another Aldi is expected to open this winter in Port St. Lucie. Not to be outdone, Wal-Mart is continuing to bring its smaller grocery-only stores to the region. Wal-Mart Neighborhood Market stores are scheduled to open early next year in Vero Beach and Port St. Lucie. The smaller stores — a typical Aldi is 18,539 square feet and a Neighborhood Market is one-fifth the size of a Supercenter — make shopping trips faster. New Aldi Aldi, one of the world’s largest grocery chains, is short for “Albrecht Discount,” named after brothers and original owners Karl and Theo Albrecht. A California offshoot of Aldi operates the trendier Trader Joe’s, a gourmet and specialty grocer whose closest stores are in Palm Beach Gardens and Wellington. The grand opening for the new Aldi, at 3937 S.E. U.S. 1, begins with a ribbon cutting at 8:45 a.m. After the ceremony, the first 100 shoppers will receive store gift certificates, free reusable bags, samples and entry in a contest to win free produce for a year. On Wednesday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., shoppers can get a sneak peek and make their first purchases at the new store. “We are pleased to bring our first store to Stuart to help customers get high-quality products at everyday low prices,” said Chris Hewitt, Aldi’s Royal Palm Beach division vice president, in a news release. “We challenge shoppers to switch from national brands to our high-quality exclusive brands and stretch their dollars without compromising quality.” Like with past Aldi grand openings, I expect many dedicated shoppers will line up early or possibly camp out. Aldi opens its third Treasure Coast store Sept. 15 in Stuart at the southeast corner of U.S. 1 and Southeast Miami Avenue near the Walmart Supercenter.  (Photo: KELLY TYKO/TREASURE COAST NEWSPAPERS) However, a competing grand opening — the region’s first Wawa also opens Thursday in Stuart at the southeast corner of Kanner Highway and Monterey Road — might split the crowds. Aldi stores primarily carry items most commonly purchased at grocery stores and don’t have pharmacy, bakery and deli departments. The store brands are more than 1,300 products and the company says it keeps prices low by using a warehouse layout and minimal staffing. Another cost-saving measure is customers “rent” shopping carts for a quarter. As long as you return your cart, you’ll get the quarter back. You also need to bring your own bags and then bag your own groceries. Since Aldi started accepting credit cards in March, I’ve been a regular shopper and my favorite things to purchase are produce and eggs because of how low the prices are. Because of the store’s generous “Double Guarantee,” I’m willing to be adventurous and try other products. With the guarantee, if you’re not 100 percent satisfied with a product, bring it back and Aldi will replace the product and refund your money. Future stores Two Wal-Mart Neighborhood Market stores are under construction and more could be in the works. Like the region’s first market in St. Lucie West, the old Vero Beach Albertsons, which closed in June 2012, is being replaced by a grocery-only Wal-Mart. A second Port St. Lucie store is being built at the northwest corner of Port St. Lucie Boulevard and Yale Street, north of Darwin Boulevard. A Wal-Mart Neighborhood Market also could replace the Fort Pierce Winn-Dixie that closed in 2013 on U.S. 1 in the Kmart plaza, according to plans on real estate website LoopNet. Wal-Mart officials would not comment on this but if it happens perhaps Aldi would open a store nearby too. Not far from where the Port St. Lucie Wal-Mart is under construction, the city’s second Aldi is being built at Gatlin Boulevard and Brighton Street and expected to open this winter, Hewitt said in an email statement. But what about an Aldi in Indian River County? While preliminary plans were filed for a location on State Road 60 near the Wal-Mart Supercenter earlier this year, formal plans haven’t been filed yet with the county. The proposed store could go in a plaza on a 9.5-acre lot between the Applebee’s and Sonny’s BBQ being proposed by Konover South, the same developer of the Stuart Aldi. Although Hewitt said he had no details he could share about a possible Indian River or Vero Beach location, I firmly believe the company will eventually open a store in the county. If not on State Road 60, maybe near the new Wal-Mart. And since both Aldi and Wal-Mart are continuing to add stores throughout Florida, I think we’ll have more places to shop in the future.

Show Caption Hide Caption Previous Next SHAWNEE, Kan. - An Overland Park man accused of attempted murder, kidnapping and robbery outside a Shawnee Walmart remains behind bars. Previous stories: Woman, good Samaritan improving after Shawnee Wal-Mart attack Shawnee Wal-Mart tops businesses police respond to in recent years Arthur Wyatt, 27, went before a judge Wednesday. Shawnee Police say he was one of two suspects involved in a shooting Sunday night. He is being held on a $1 million bond. “My brother was in the wrong. No matter what anybody says, no matter how I feel about him being gone, I will always openly admit that he was wrong for what he did,” Kayla Blackmon told 41 Action News. Blackmon’s older brother John Simmons was with Wyatt when the shooting occurred. Simmons was shot and killed at the scene. "We are so sorry for everyone that is affected by this. We hate the fact that they have to go home traumatized, their lives have changed, everything has changed. A lot of things have changed due to this once incident,” said Blackmon. Shawnee Police say Wyatt and Simmons attacked a mother who was buckling her child into a carseat. According to the police report, two good samaritans rushed over to the mother’s car, who 41 Action News confirmed is a Johnson County paramedic, to help. Joshua Owen, 33, was one of the good Samaritans. His family told 41 Action News, Owen was shot three times— in the face, chest and arm. Owen has already undergone two surgeries and his recovering in the hospital. He is an Air Force veteran who severed overseas in Iraq and Afghanistan. Owen’s 15-year-old daughter, Halle, sent 41 Action News this statement, via text: “To me, my dad is a hero. He risked his life trying to save someone else’s. I love him with all my heart and I’m so thankful that he is going to be fine. I’m so thankful that the people were there to help my dad. Without them, I would’ve lost the best dad that I could have ever asked for.” A GoFundMe account has been set up to help Owen’s family with medical expenses.  ------   Ariel Rothfield can be reached at Ariel.Rothfield@KSHB.com.

(This year’s new creations include fried Jello and pulled pork-stuffed fried Funyuns.) But if one fair food vendor has it his way, fair-worthy fried food will be as close as your nearest Walmart. State Fair vendor Isaac Rousso, who’s won numerous awards for his deep-fried wonders, is opening a fair food-themed restaurant inside a Walmart in the Dallas suburb of Plano next week. The Dallas Morning News reports it’ll be “the first in a region-wide, then potentially nationwide expansion.” The aptly named State Fair Treats, described as a “retro-themed diner,” will serve funnel cake fries, corn dogs, “deep-fried hash browns stuffed with bacon and cheddar cheese,” and Rousso’s new cookie fries (deep-fried cookie dough masquerading as crinkle fries, with chocolate and strawberry sauces for dipping), among other things. This is the same guy that unleashed nuclear-colored bacon margaritas on an unsuspecting public, so expect things to get weird. Rousso anticipates he’ll have more than a dozen locations open by the end of 2017, and tells the Morning News he’s looking to snap up vacant spaces inside Walmart stores as big chains like McDonald’s move out. While we’d argue that the best part about State Fair food is that it’s only available three weeks each year, perhaps Walmart customers in other parts of the country will take delight in discovering the kind of deep-fried oddities that Texans have punished their bodies with for years. • Deep-Fried State Fair Food Will Be Served At A Plano Walmart 365 Days a Year [E] • State Fair Fixture Isaac Rousso Opening Restaurant in Plano Walmart [DMN] • The Weirdest Things to Eat at the 2016 State Fair of Texas [E] More From Eater Watch: How to Turn Leftover Sashimi Into Beer-Battered Fish Tacos The Eater Guide to the Whole Entire World The 23 Most Anticipated Restaurant Openings of Fall 2016 Escaping the Restaurant Industry's Motherhood Trap The 24-Year-Old Coca-Cola Virgin The Biggest New Cookbooks of 2016 Most Read Internet Crazies Think This DC Pizzeria Is the Center of a Clinton Sex Ring The 9 Hottest New Restaurants in Tucson, Arizona Watch: Eating Wagyu Beef From Nose to Tail at This Meaty Omakase This Article has a component height of 6.

First came a woman’s scream. Then Linda saw and heard another woman yell directly to her: “Call 911! He’s got a gun!” The Segebrechts had driven smack into the middle of what authorities say was a brutal attempted robbery that turned into a deadly encounter between two attackers and two unrelated Good Samaritans. In a matter of minutes one of the attackers was dead and one of the Good Samaritans was critically wounded, as was a mother who apparently was the initial target. Exactly three days after that Sunday afternoon incident, at 1:30 p.m. Wednesday, an Overland Park man made his first appearance in Johnson County District Court. Arthur Fred Wyatt III, 27, is charged with attempted first-degree murder and other crimes, accused of repeatedly hitting the mother on the head and trying to rob her. When Magistrate Judge Daniel W. Vokins learned that Wyatt’s previous convictions included involuntary manslaughter and aggravated arson, he doubled the bond to $2 million. facebook twitter email Share More Videos 2:20 Grandma of KCK boy fed to pigs recites a message she wrote to her grandson Pause 0:35 Crime video: Man robs Hy-Vee Pharmacy in Leawood 0:14 Who kicked this small dog down a flight of stairs?

The 33-year-old Kansas City man faces many surgeries in the weeks ahead and is not expected to be able to work for at least six months. “We will continue to pray for a speedy recovery for Josh, as well as the victims and any other members of the community who were affected by this unfortunate and unforgettable event,” Owen’s sister-in-law Brittany Parks wrote on the GoFundMe page. “We ask you to do the same.” Linda Segebrecht, an education consultant who has worked with the Battle of the Brains at Union Station’s Science City and several other projects, immediately called 911 as the woman in the parking lot implored her to do. Charles Segebrecht, a volunteer firefighter for Lake Quivira, at first mistakenly thought someone was having a heart attack and he prepared to do what he could to help. That’s when the gunfire began. The Segebrechts saw it all through their windshield. “Two men tumbled out in front of us and one had a gun and was shooting at the other one,” Linda Segebrecht said. “They were wrestling on the ground.” One of those men was 28-year-old John W. Simmons III of Kansas City. The other was Owen, who was not armed but was coming to the aid of a woman who was struck in the back of the head as she was placing her child into a car seat in the parking lot outside the lawn and garden section of the Wal-Mart. “And then a third man came out from between the cars and he shot the man with the gun,” Linda Segebrecht continued. “He shot, it looked like, several times. It looked like he was trying to get up and then finally he fell backwards.” Simmons died at the scene. According to police, the second man with a gun was a second Good Samaritan. Police questioned that 36-year-old De Soto resident and released him later that afternoon. Police have not released his name. By this time Charles Segebrecht was backing up, trying to get himself and his wife away from any errant bullets. “My husband turned and saw a second man run up the hill and the back down the hill,” Linda Segebrecht said. “Then he turned around and ran away.” That, apparently, was the other alleged attacker. A police K9 unit soon apprehended nearby a man who fit the description that witnesses gave. But they later released him after determining he was not involved in the Wal-Mart incident. Police then began the hunt for the second attacker, which led them Tuesday to Wyatt. Wyatt was convicted as a juvenile in 2003 of aggravated arson and a few years later of involuntary manslaughter in Wyandotte County. He was convicted again in Wyandotte County in 2012 on a drug charge. He was released from state prison in July 2015 and his sentence expired in July this year. According to court records, Wyatt was either employed by or had some affiliation with Avenue of Life, a Kansas City, Kan., organization whose mission “is to mobilize our community to equip and empower low-income individuals and families to be self-sustained and independent,” according to its website. The organization did not return calls Wednesday. Wyatt’s father on Wednesday told The Kansas City Star that his son was at the crime scene at Wal-Mart on Sunday but said he was not the gunman. “All I can say is my son never pulled a trigger on a gun at that site and he’s being blamed for everything,” Arthur Wyatt Jr. said. “He didn’t have a gun and they didn’t find no gunshot residue on him or nothing. … I think it’s an injustice on the Shawnee Mission police force to say, ‘OK, we’re going to put all the blame on you and we got our man and glorify ourselves,’ because he wasn’t the guy that committed the crime.” The criminal complaint against Wyatt alleges he did shoot at Owen with the premeditation of killing him. It also alleges that Wyatt repeatedly struck the mother, identified only as “M.D.J.” and a 39-year-old Kansas City, Kan., resident. The complaint alleges Wyatt’s actions were an attempted kidnapping and that he tried to grab her “purse or keys or motor vehicle.” The woman was released from a hospital on Monday. Arthur Wyatt Jr. said his son did not know what Simmons intended to do in that parking lot and that he thinks Simmons had a bipolar disorder. Federal court records show that Simmons, at the time of his death, was under indictment in U.S. District Court in Western Missouri for possession with intent to distribute cocaine and for having a firearm while trafficking drugs and for being a felon in possession of a firearm. Missouri court records show Simmons had a protective order against him in 2013, ordering him to stay away from a person with whom he had a child. The day Wyatt was charged, Owen underwent a second surgery, this one on his hand, according to the GoFundMe page. A previous surgery on Sunday was on his face after a bullet removed part of his nose, shattered cheek bones and damaged nerves. A third bullet struck his chest and traveled up to his left shoulder and remained lodged in the bone on Wednesday, according to the GoFundMe page. He is unable to eat because of the surgeries and trauma to his face; a tube offers nutrients. “This past Sunday was not the first time Josh has put his life on the line to save someone else’s,” the page said, adding that the joined the Air Force after 9/11  and during more than four years’ deployment served in Iraq and Afghanistan. “He was also present during the shooting at Independence Center in 2012, and quickly responded by helping aid people who were injured,” the page said. “Josh has always put others before himself, and we are all confident he will continue to do so, even after this tragic event that has left him hospitalized.” The Saturday afternoon shooting at Independence Center in 2012 injured two people and caused the mall to shut down for several hours. Linda Segebrecht said she had never before experienced anything like what happened Sunday afternoon in the Wal-Mart parking lot and she hopes she never will again. As she related events to a police dispatcher on the phone, she did not realize that Good Samaritans were involved. “It was absolutely shocking to see all that happen in front of you,” she said. “It didn’t seem real.” To reach Matt Campbell: goodsamaritan@kcstar.com, 816-234-4902, @mattcampbellKC Related content Good Samaritan shot, alleged robber slain near Wal-Mart in Shawnee LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Crime Comments Videos facebook twitter email Share More Videos 2:20 Grandma of KCK boy fed to pigs recites a message she wrote to her grandson Pause 0:35 Crime video: Man robs Hy-Vee Pharmacy in Leawood 0:14 Who kicked this small dog down a flight of stairs?

Michael Taleb, 41, was found by Lt./Detective Mike Nichols and Patrolman Travis Rutherford in the store's electronics department. One of the store managers explained to the officers that Taleb tried to return cell phones to the store. When she was told that the 15-day return limit had expired on the phones, Taleb “...began yelling and screaming about the policy...,” the probable cause affidavit related. When she reportedly refused to leave the store, the manager had an employee call 9-1-1 and request police assistance. Officers attempted to calm the woman and then called for Scott County EMS to come when she stated she felt ill. When told the ambulance would take her to Scott Memorial Hospital, Taleb apparently became upset again and refused to get into the ambulance, saying she wanted to go to University of Louisville Hospital instead. Told she would have to go to the local hospital first as a matter of EMS policy, the woman still refused to be helped by the technicians and stated she would not leave the store either. At that point, Lt. Nichols attempted to handcuff the woman, but, in the struggle that followed, both EMS technicians and Lt. Nichols were allegedly struck or scratched by her. When Lt. Nichols walked Taleb to his patrol car, he said the woman fell. EMS staff assisted Taleb off the ground and onto a stretcher. She was transported to Scott Memorial where her handcuffs were removed by Deputy Jac Sanders so she could be examined by emergency room staff. He had to “forcefully” place them back on her, and the woman was taken to the Scott County Security Center after being released by a doctor. Lt. Nichols noted that the woman's 13-year-old daughter was recording portions of the incident. The girl and her mother's possessions were released to her older brother. A copy of the Wal-Mart store security video and tapes of the store manager's 9-1-1 call and two 9-1-1 calls made by Taleb have been obtained as evidence by the police department. Taleb was charged with two Level 5 battery charges for hurting Lt. Nichols and one of the EMS technicians. A Level 6 battery charge was added for the injury she allegedly caused to the second EMS technician. A Level 6 felony resisting law enforcement is also among her charges as are two misdemeanor charges of criminal trespass and disorderly conduct. Taleb appeared for her initial hearing in Scott Circuit Court on Wednesday, September 7. A preliminary plea of not guilty was entered for her, and her case was assigned to a public defender. An initial jury trial date of December 13 was scheduled. Bail was set at $10,000 by corporate surety bond or $1,000 cash. As conditions of her bail, Taleb was advised that she was not to contact either Lt. Nichols or the EMS technician hurt in the scuffle nor was she to go onto Wal-Mart property again. Judge Roger Duvall set a hearing to review her bail on Tuesday, September 13.   -30-

Unfortunately they’ll be out of the artisanal potato chips and organic cottage cheese. Instead, you’ll receive Doritos and Cheez Whiz. Close enough, right? Libra (9/23-10/22) — You’ll blitz through town ripping down Halloween decorations you feel are up too early. You’ll continue by pulling banners off the endcaps of a local grocery store for the same reason. Psych evaluations are in your future. Scorpio (10/23-11/21) — With a hint of fall in the air, you’ll break out your flannel shirt and winter cap. Despite their style and comfort between the hours of 8 p.m. and 8 a.m., come noon you’ll be sweating like Michael Jackson at an orphan’s picnic. Sagittarius (11/22-12/22) — Inspired by the Alabama Coastal Cleanup, you decide to purge the clutter from your life and organize all your remaining possessions alphabetically and according to color. Weeks later, you’ll be diagnosed with OCD, but luckily, you’ll also be down with O.P.P. Capricorn (12/23-1/19) — After spending last weekend decorating your front porch for Halloween, you’ll be disappointed when a vigilante sabotages the display overnight. In an effort to protect it, you’ll spend the next six weeks standing guard, motionless, dressed as the Grim Reaper. Aquarius (1/20-2/18) — Misunderstanding the Mobile Arts Council’s annual “Throwdown,” you’ll arrive wearing nothing but tight briefs and a Mexican wrestling mask. But a fight will erupt anyway after you declare that pop art is boring and Picasso’s Blue Period was more like an ultramarine. Pisces (2/19-3/20) — You’ll storm the field during a football game, shirtless and drunk, evading police for about two minutes before becoming winded and surrendering. Despite your very public crime, you’ll be offered immunity along with a position on the force. Aries (3/21-4/19) — After your favorite internet cartoon is hijacked by the “alt-right,” you’ll finally take it upon yourself to shut down Breitbart.com. After learning to code and planning a multistage hack, you’ll realize nobody but your uncle reads the website and apply for a job in IT somewhere. Taurus (4/20-5/20) — Despite being reared as a patriotic American, your boycott of the NFL over its failure to condemn peaceful protests won’t last. With a fantasy app beeping and constant peer pressure, you’ll be painting your face again by next Sunday. Gemini (5/21-6/21) — As a Republican, you’ll mourn for your party after watching a recent candidate compete on “Dancing with the Stars.” If the rise of Donald Trump wasn’t enough, the fact that Rick Perry’s footwork is far superior to his foreign policy plan should drive the point right home. Cancer (6/22-7/22) — Inspired by YouTube videos aimed at gaining awareness and acceptance of various disorders, you’ll take to Bienville Square to create your own. You’ll demonstrate your problems with rage by screaming at and breaking the cell phone video recorder when the music starts. Leo (7/23-8/23) — It’ll be a new battle of the bulge, when your guilt will force you on a juice cleanse after workday candy bars cause your weight to balloon to 10 pounds above your previous high in college. You’ll drink only juice for exactly half a day before consuming a Big Mac.

Reports Results for Three and Nine Months Ended July 31, 2016 STATEN ISLAND, NY -- (Marketwired) -- 09/14/16 -- Coffee Holding Co., Inc. (NASDAQ: JVA) (the "Company") today announced its operating results for the three and nine months ended July 31, 2016: Net sales totaled $17,354,533 for the three months ended July 31, 2016, a decrease of $9,685,324, or 35.8%, from $27,039,857 for the three months ended July 31, 2015. The decrease in net sales reflects reduced wholesale transactions with our largest wholesale green coffee customer during the quarter of approximately $9,379,000. Cost of sales for the three months ended July 31, 2016 was $14,203,343, or 81.9% of net sales, as compared to $24,991,366, or 92.5% of net sales, for the three months ended July 31, 2015. Cost of sales consists primarily of the cost of green coffee and packaging materials and realized and unrealized gains or losses on hedging activity. The decrease in cost of sales reflects a more favorable inventory position during the quarter and reduced wholesale transactions with our largest wholesale green coffee customer. Gross profit for the three months ended July 31, 2016 was $3,151,190, an increase of $1,102,699 from $2,048,491 for the three months ended July 31, 2015. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to 18.1% for the three months ended July 31, 2016 from 7.5% for the three months ended July 31, 2015. The increase in gross profits was due to improved margins on our wholesale and roasted business as well as a decrease in our losses quarter to quarter on our hedging operations. Total operating expenses decreased by $18,785 to $1,868,223 for the three months ended July 31, 2016 from $1,887,008 for the three months ended July 31, 2015. The decrease was primarily the result of a decrease of $18,785 to $1,704,373 in selling and administrative expenses for the three months ended July 31, 2016 from $1,723,158 for the three months ended July 31, 2015. The Company had net income of $755,518 or $0.12 per share basic and diluted, for the three months ended July 31, 2016 compared to net income of $139,162, or $0.02 per share basic and diluted for the three months ended July 31, 2015. The increase in net income was due primarily to the reasons described above. "I'm pleased to report another solid quarter to our shareholders as we earned $0.12 per share for the quarter ended July 31, 2016 versus $0.02 per share for last year's corresponding quarter. The second half of the quarter saw positive developments for the green coffee market as prices continued to rise from previous lows. These higher prices have translated into improved margins on our sales of specialty green coffee as we are able to take advantage of our favorable inventory position. This trend continues into the fourth quarter as the market is currently trading at highest level since February of 2015 and we believe this trend will be sustainable for the foreseeable future. Also, during the quarter, we completed our acquisition of the assets of Coffee Kinetics LLC, doing business as Sonofresco, a seller of electrical table top roasters and specialty green coffee. Sonofresco's financial results from the month of July are reflected in this quarter's results and going forward, will be fully integrated in our consolidated financial statements. The Sonofresco acquisition has already been accretive to both top and bottom line results and the effects of a higher green coffee market will assist in meeting our positive expectations," commented Andrew Gordon, the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer. "As previously announced, we are excited about the rollout of our Café Caribe flagship brand, a popular Spanish style espresso roast coffee, in approximately 900 Food Lion grocery stores and our new business developments with Smart&Final and Wal-Mart. Food Lion is a prominent food retailer located in areas where we previously had limited distribution of Café Caribe and we are excited about the opportunity for expansion into this market. While we have not yet seen the impact of our Smart&Final and Wal-Mart partnerships on our financial statements as these took place late in the quarter, we look forward to these results in upcoming quarters. "We remain upbeat that going forward we will begin to rebuild top line revenue growth in conjunction with our improved bottom line results by continuing our aggressive approach to seeking new business opportunities and sustaining our margins on both current and new business," concluded Mr. Gordon.

To be honest, I hadn’t had much of an encounter with America itself. I had only arrived the country the first time just over a week ago. And my encounter had been mostly limited to the pleasantly choreographed tours around the twin cities of St. Paul and Minneapolis by the wonderful organisers of the World Press Institute (WPI) fellowship. I had only gone out once on my own to a nearby Walmart to buy groceries. The trip to Ely was also particularly interesting to me because I was earnestly looking forward to seeing what life in rural America looked like, having spent some part of my teenage years in a rural community in Lagos. I like making comparisons. I have come to believe that most big cities around the world are essentially alike – a core, made of huge concrete edifices, mostly fenced by affluent suburbs, with a mix of undesirable slums pushed further away or hidden from view like piles of used dishes after a feast. So, Lagos minus 17 million people, the chaotic rush hour traffic, and Keke Napep (tricycle popularly called tuk-tuk in some parts of the world) would not be much different from the Twin Cities. I had not spent time in rural communities in any other countries I had visited before so I was eager to see how rural America compared to rural Nigeria. There was not much comparison to be made. Rural America was not the neglected poverty-stricken, hopeless settlements that rural Nigeria is. One could move back and forth from urban America to rural America without the degraded standard of living that such a movement in Nigeria would have automatically elicited. I tried to imagine how things would have been different if politicians back home could be made to see the benefits of developing their rural communities but the picture of Kano State governor, Abdullahi Ganduje, commissioning a hand pumped borehole early this year kept popping up in my mind. I had no intention of getting depressed so turned and mimicked Marina, the fellow from Bulgaria and Natalia, from Ukraine, who were speaking Russian inside our van. The ensuing laughter was therapeutic. Ely was a beautiful town of 3,500 people sheltered by forests of tall pines and several lakes. Ely was old money. You know this as soon as you drive into the town. Its picturesque setting provides the perfect summer getaway for wealthy Minnesotans, who own beautiful lakeside cabins inside the woods. I didn’t have to wait long before I found out the source of the old money – mining. A resident, Hans Olsen, 73, told me that buried under the pines of Ely is huge deposits of copper, nickel and 20 other minerals. John Seliga, inside the old Pioneer Mine, Ely Minnesota. “At its peak, two-third of all the iron ore in the United States came from Ely,” he said. The Pioneer Mine, which opened in 1888 was forced to close in 1967 due to the introduction of new steel-making technology where oxygen was directly shot into the steel via ceramic lances thereby ending the demand in the richly oxygenated ore found in Ely. However, by the time it closed the mine had shipped 41,112,587 tons of iron ore. In 2015, many inhabitants were filled with hope of the return of the town’s heydays after Twin Metals LLC, owned by Chilean mining conglomerate, Antofagasta Plc, announced it was considering revisiting an underground mine near the Birch Lake, southeast of Ely, where large deposits of copper and nickel were found. The announcement caused a crack in the relationship between local Ely politicians and residents, who wanted the mines back and state politicians and environmentalists, who feared that the return of sulphide mining in the area might destroy the forest and contaminate the pristine lakes in the area. John Seliga, who worked at the Pioneer Mine from 1957 to 1966, six months before the mine was closed, said the concerns about the resumption of mining in the area were unfounded. He added that if anything at all there are now technologies to stop any environmental hazards that may result from mining in the area. “The mining company (Oliver Mining Company, a division of US Steel) allowed you to go to college. As long as they do it right there shouldn’t be any problem,” he said, his voice overflowing with nostalgia. Similarly, Seraphine Rolando, picker/historian, who conducted the WPI fellows on a tour of the Pioneer Mine, said the state of Minnesota maintained the highest environmental standards you can find anywhere. He doesn’t see the reason why the anti-mining people are worried. “At this stage, the mining company is only testing to see what can be found. But it would eventually happen because there is a lot of jobs to be created. Job creation and the prosperity of the town was also high on the mind of Anne Swenson. “The three biggest industry in the town are mining, logging, and tourism. How much do loggers make? Maybe $9,000. You’d be lucky if you made $9,000 from working in tourism but studies have shown that miner could make up to $60,000 to $70,000 a year,” she said. Ms Swenson was probably referring to a 2009 study by the University of Minnesota, Duluth. The study revealed the enormous impact of the return of mining in northern Minnesota. The Study, “The Economic Impact of Ferrous and Non-Ferrous Mining Study on the State of Minnesota” found that Iron mining helped contribute $3.1 billion to the state’s economy in 2007 and helped support more than 10,000 jobs. Iron mining paid $148 million in state and local taxes in 2008, based on 2007 production levels. Of that amount, $46 million was used to supported local schools, $11 million supported the University of Minnesota and what was left was spent on mining communities. The study also showed that mining was the single largest contributor to the region’s economy. It was responsible for 23 percent of the gross regional product in 2001; in 2007, mining was responsible for 34 percent of the gross regional product. As she drove me back to her lovely cabin on Eagle Nest Lake, Cynthia Stokes, 83, said she believed that the numbers of pro-mining people of Ely  are exaggerated. “Usually, the company goes away after five or six years. It could create negligible jobs and pollution will stay for a long time,” she said. However, she added that she somehow understands the need to kick-start the economy of Ely and as someone who only spend the summer in the town she doesn’t think she qualifies to tell the people what they want. Lessons for Nigeria I think Nigeria has a lot to learn from the arguments for and against mining in Ely. As the federal government moves towards the exploration of solid minerals as an alternative means of revenue in the face of cascading oil prices, I believe some of the arguments going on in Ely should be replicated back home. But unfortunately, I do not see any of those. The government seems to have made up its mind and unlike in Ely are forcing its decision down the throats of the communities where these mining are expected to take place. All I have read is about how much the government stands to make. Very little, if any, attention is being paid to the impact mining would have on the environment and on the lives of the people in mining communities. This is most unfortunate because it seems we have not learned from the havoc wrecked by oil exploration to the rich creeks of the Niger Delta. Neither have we learned anything from widespread deaths due to lead poisoning in Niger and Zamfara States. In Ely, the people are part of the debate. Even those in support of mining are insisting on the highest safety standard. To avoid the debacle that the Niger Delta has since become, the Nigerian government should copy this model.

Please include your name, city of residence and a daytime phone number for verification. Danger zones Wouldn't it be great to pass through any downtown/west-side/east-side/north-side/south-side congested area, I-25 exit/on-ramp, underneath I-25 overpasses, every shopping mall, Walmart, Target, every stoplight, and now nearly all major roads... without seeing young kids, middle-aged substance abusers, men, women, elderly, and their dogs, camped on the median panhandling for money? Notice I said money, that's an important point. Obviously I would never group all people under the same umbrella, but let's say 85 percent of the people panhandling don't want food, water, groceries, a free meal, or information directing them to various Colorado Springs homeless shelters and substance-abuse programs. Sounds like exaggeration but I've tried on many occasions to help with the aforementioned items, including printed-out papers with local resources. Are we waiting for one of these people to be smashed in the roadway before we act? Some innocent driver will spend the rest of his life thinking about a senseless death he caused because we don't "police" our roadways. (CSPD should check with Manitou Springs Police Department and traffic enforcement; they're well-trained in these operations.) Can kids set up lemonade stands in these same places? Can the tamale lady occupy these dangerous areas also? Or, just people under the influence with the most potential for falling into traffic? Come on Springs we're better than this. — William Hoopes Colorado Springs Willing to help The mission of Incline Friends is to advocate for preservation and maintenance of and public access to the Manitou Incline. We recognize that Incline-related visitation has heavily impacted the residents on Ruxton Avenue and in Engelmann Canyon. Please note that Incline-related visitation is not the only issue that creates quality-of-life and public-safety issues — visitors to the Cog Railway and to Barr Trail contribute significantly to the traffic. The city of Manitou Springs has implemented some measures to try to mitigate the traffic on Ruxton, including limiting public parking, providing free parking on the eastern edge of town, along with a year-round, free shuttle from the free parking to the base of the Incline. While these measures have helped, they have not solved the problem. The Incline is a tremendous asset to Manitou, Colorado Springs and the Pikes Peak region. It is worth hundreds of thousands of dollars in free marketing and is recognized nationally and internationally. Most cities would love to have this "problem." The Incline, Ring the Peak Trail, Barr Trail, the soon-to-be "Missing Link" trail that connects Barr Trail to the Bear Creek watershed, and Colorado Springs' south slope watershed offer a world-class outdoor recreation experience. Together, they make the region a tremendous place to live and play. This is something to be celebrated, and involved parties are encouraged to work together to find solutions to issues created by the use of these resources. Incline Friends will cooperate in any manner that we can to further a solution. — David Adair President, Incline Friends No bikes in the wild We are blessed with a wide variety of public lands, an incredible heritage that can be passed on to our grandchildren, if we're vigilant. Unfortunately, population growth, energy development, ATV proliferation and other human activities have steadily eroded wildlife habitat on far too many public lands. A new twist in this degradation involves the efforts of the Sustainable Trails Coalition (STC), pushing to allow bicycles in wilderness areas. According to the STC website, "The political stars are currently aligned in our favor on Capitol Hill. We will be working with a Republican-controlled U.S. House and Senate that philosophically favor limited government and oppose severe and overzealous regulation..." Two GOP senators from Utah, Orrin Hatch and Mike Lee, are doing the STC's dirty work, pushing a bill to allow bikes in wilderness areas. They don't care about bicyclists, but they are interested in more oil wells, sulfide mines, etc. The proposal is controversial in the biking community, and opposed by hunters, anglers and others who say bikes would degrade wildlife habitat and erode trails. Some 116 conservation and preservation organizations have formally asked Congress to oppose attempts to weaken wilderness protections via this legislation. Here in Colorado, the Aspen-based Roaring Fork Mountain Biking Association, aligned with the International Mountain Bicycling Association (IMBA), does not support the effort to open wilderness trails to mountain bikes, said Mike Pritchard, the local organization's executive director. Ashley Korenblat, a former IMBA chair, adds: "We don't need to ride our bikes everywhere." Research shows that increased mountain bike and recreational disturbance has a negative impact on big game and other wildlife species. As a result, sportsmen's groups like Backcountry Hunters & Anglers support management planning that minimizes the impacts of mountain biking and other growing recreational demands. We believe wilderness designations work well as currently stipulated in the Wilderness Act and oppose efforts to rewrite the act to allow mountain bike and mechanized use in wilderness areas. — David Lien Chairman, Colorado Backcountry Hunters & Anglers Colorado Springs Come together As I live in and love America, past, present and hopefully the future, I feel obligated to have a candid conversation with my mother country, my (and our) only home. Like every cherished relative, our mother, as great as she is, is not perfect. Try as she might, she can't be all things to all people, but like all good mothers she has to fight for all her children. All people are her children, and we must fight to understand each other. As brothers and sisters, united under one flag, standing, sitting or kneeling. — Joe Debise Falcon Women for change American women have had a lot to celebrate this summer. In July, we saw the first female presidential nominee of a major party. And in August, female athletes were the unquestionable breakout stars of Team USA. Despite these high points we can't take for granted what's at stake for women in America. Women are more likely to live in poverty and work a minimum-wage job. Access to reproductive health care is threatened, and sexual assault pervades our campuses and communities. We need quality legislation and leadership to address these critical issues. We need more women to jump into politics and begin moving up the ladder. That's where Emerge Colorado comes in. We're Colorado's premier candidate training program, giving Democratic women the skills and network they need to run for office and win. We're recruiting for the class of 2017 now. Applications are available at emergeco.org. Let us help you be a force of change. — Jenny Willford Executive Director, Emerge Colorado Denver More Letters » Tweet Letters Speaking of...

Nelson Mandela Home About Us Projects Multimedia Opinion Reports Agenda Contacts Search for: Article written on 14.09.2016 at 08:20 AM by Joshua Massarenti Article tags Feminism multinational corporations Oxfam Tax category: Africa, Economy, Gender, Rights and Society Corporate tax is a feminist matter 0 Sep14 CitiGroup, Coca Cola, ExxonMobil, General Motors, Goldman Sachs, Verizon, Wal-Mart, Pfizer, JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America and Microsoft; of all the things these multinational corporations (MNCs) agree on, two things stand out: a proclaimed devotion to the feminist agenda and a penchant for tax dodging. On the former, all MNC’s claim to dedicate some part of their corporate responsibility and philanthropy duties to the “economic empowerment” of women and girls in poor countries, and to that end, promote business skills, good saving practices and access to loans as a panacea for women’s empowerment and their countries’ development. The steps these corporations take “to advance and empower women” make them role models for gender justice among MNC’s, according to the United Nations Global Compact. But then there’s the tax issue. A few months ago, the NGO Oxfam calculated that between 2008 and 2014 alone, the 50 largest public companies in the US accumulated some $337 billion in tax breaks, while holding a whopping $1.4 trillion in offshore cash reserves. All the companies mentioned above are on the list. Tax dodging by MNCs represents “integral components of [their] profit-making strategies,” and a huge force of socio-economic devastation in particular for the Global South, where such taxes represent a larger share of overall government revenue (16%, according to the IMF, versus 8 % for their high-income counterparts), and where the technical capacity to deal with complex tax offshore investment hubs and other loopholes is weaker. Here, Oxfam argues, unpaid corporate taxes can make the “difference between life and death, poverty and opportunity.” The practice costs poor countries aroundUS$ 100 billion dollars a year. The result, predictably, is that across Africa, the working poor, (over 38% of the population in sub-Saharan Africa) often end up carrying the burden of raising tax revenue while the multinationals go scot-free. In Malawi, for example, where tax incentives for the mining sector allegedly suck out eight times the amount the government collects in revenues every year, some say that “it is the order of the day for small businesses to pay more tax than multinational companies.” Meanwhile, as a new investigation reveals, South African companies make extensive use of tax haven benefits in the Netherlands, where, apparently, “an office with a house plant is enough to satisfy tax inspectors that a company really has operations in [Amsterdam],” rather than just a letterbox company. (By routing money through the Netherlands, companies reportedly push down their tax rate from to as low as 0,6 %. Of the 20 largest companies listed on the Johannesburg stock exchange, 14 have one or more subsidiaries in the Netherlands). Within progressive feminist groups and anti-poverty NGOs, tax justice is now treated as a key development and human rights concern, with many feminists pointing out that it’s women and children who suffer the most, when social services are not provided. Chiara Capraro worked for Christian Aid, whose Death And Taxes report estimated, as early as 2008, that developing countries lost more to false invoicing and trade mis-pricing by corporations (more on that later) than what comes in as development aid. Later, in partnership with Tax Justice Network Africa (who tweet here), they published “Africa Rising” which (amongst other things) outlines steps on how to stop corporations and other elites from abusing tax loopholes. To Chiara, who is now Policy and Advocacy Manager for Women’s Economic Rights at Womankind in London, corporate tax is a feminist matter and a huge potential source of empowerment for women, if given the chance to learn about, and organize around it.

Harris Dozens of RVs have populated the parking lot of Wal-Mart as the Pendleton Round-Up moves into full swing. Buy this photo Staff photo by E.J. Harris Campsites are popping up all over Pendleton this week, and that includes in the parking lot of Wal-Mart. Buy this photo Recreational vehicles flood Pendleton each Round-Up, and plenty park for free and pay nothing in taxes. But others pay hundreds of dollars to set up shop in designated RV parks. The city of Pendleton requires trailer and mobile home businesses collect a transient room tax and the tourism promotion assessment charge, just like hotels. The tax is 8 percent for parks and hotels alike, and hotels pay an additional tourism charge of $1.50 per night per paid room while the parks pay 50 cents per night for each paid mobile home or trailer park space. The city uses the money to fund its convention center and boost tourism efforts. In its city budget, Pendleton projected $98,000 in revenue from the tourism charge for fiscal year 2017. The Pendleton Wal-Mart, 2203 S.W. Court Ave., allows Rocket RV Parking to provide RV and camping space on the south side of the large parking lot. Dozens of campers have staked their claims. Rocket asks for $25 for the length of the stay, but that is only a “suggested donation,” according to the handmade sign at the site. The money benefits Pilot Rock High School, home of the Rockets. Doug and Becky Reynolds are in their second year of operating Lookout RV Park & Storage, 601 Airport Road, which has 28 spaces. The business charges $35 a night to park an RV there during Round-Up. That means $3.30 of each charge goes to the city. Doug Reynolds said no one really knows how much free RV parking is available in Pendleton. While those sites — and some who just park on city streets or empty lots — do not pay their fair share, Reynolds said he and his wife have no plans to complain about it. “We just work hard, keep our heads down,” he said. “We want to add to the solution, not the problem.” KOA campground, 1375 S.E. Third St., has 101 spaces, though some are reserved for people living there month-to-month. Tina Groshen works at the KOA. She said parking there during Round-Up requires a commitment to a seven-day reservation at a cost of $450-$550, whether or not a guest stays the whole time. KOA rents any open spaces this week for $60 a night. She said the campground is “completely booked all the way” for Round-Up. The business has not felt pressure from free RV parking, even outside of Round-Up week. One or two people a month assert they can park for free at Wal-Mart, Groshen said, but KOA campers are a loyal lot. The Pendleton site also is just moments away from Interstate 84 and has full electrical hookups, wi-fi, showers and laundry, all part of the price. Groshen said the park even provides breakfasts on Saturdays from May though September. And during Round-Up, she said, there are breakfasts and dinners every day. The RV parks also purchase an annual city business license. The city’s basic fee is $100 for businesses inside city limits and $160 for those outside. Pendleton Police Chief Stuart Roberts said free parking lots do not require a license. “The way we handle the Round-Up business license issue is we start by generating a master list of all temporary business licenses, which has been amassed since May or so,” Roberts said in an email. “The code enforcement officer then inspects every license/location. Typically, she will find additional ‘pop-up’ vendors who are shut down until a license is obtained.” That process continues, he said, until city hall closes its doors Friday. After that, any new pop-ups police find face a choice: shut down or face a fine. The city also exempts civic and nonprofit groups from the business licenses fee. Those are the kinds of groups, such as Rocket RV, that often operate parking lots during Round-Up to raise funds. RV parking in Pendleton is no longer a Round-Up only event. Although just two years old, Pendleton Bike Week saw attendance jump in its second year, and plenty of campers were involved. “For Bike Week, we filled up,” Groshen said. “And I’ve already got people wanting to come to bike week next year.” Several cities in Oregon have banned overnight parking at Wal-Marts, including in Hood River, Portland and Salem. Local RV park operators, though, expressed ambivalence about such a move, even as Pendleton pushes to become a destination beyond the second full week of September.

Companies such as Walmart and Amazon manufacture next to nothing but sell hundreds of billions of dollars worth of merchandise. The macro trend — the transition from a manufacturing economy to a service-based high-tech economy — has been in place for decades. Millions of jobs that used to be done by people are now done by robots and several million jobs have been outsourced to other countries because of much cheaper labor costs. As labor costs rise overseas many of these jobs are starting to come back. The current government work-force is about 6.9 percent of the population. This is the lowest number in decades. Typically it is between 7 percent and 7.5 percent in the modern era. On the federal side of the equation, there were 5.3 million federal workers in 1962 and there are 4.1 million workers today. Keep in mind our population has grown from 180 million in 1962 people to more than 320 million people today. In terms of government workers not producing anything, I would argue a surgeon, plumber or architect who works for the government produces exactly the same thing as his private-sector counterpart. Gerry Hageman Las Vegas Preaching division If you read Zach Linly’s Sunday commentary, “White people just don’t get racism,” and mentally transpose “black” for “white” — and vice versa — you have a great draft for a white supremacist manifesto. His suggestion that “black people” should disengage with “white America” sounds like segregation to me. Rick Houle Las Vegas All for one I read with interest the Monday Review-Journal article, “City, county try to ease tensions.” While I appreciate the desires of the City Council and County Commission for a “kumbaya” agreement, nothing to date has produced any results. Meanwhile, we and other property owners in the northwest, who have been forcibly annexed into the city over the past few years, are paying property taxes 20 percent higher due to the annexations. For these additional taxes, we get nothing — no additional (or better) fire, police or utility services. When my husband and I attended an informational meeting prior to our property being annexed, we were told that there was nothing we could do about it, just grin and pay for it. When we asked what additional services we would receive for the additional taxes, the only thing the city officials could come up with was “you will get your streets cleaned.” That was false, given we live in a gated community with private streets. We do get to vote for mayor and our City Council representative, so we know where our votes are not going. Perhaps those of us who have either been annexed or are threatened with annexation should consider strongly the views of those running in the next elections and their positions on these forcible annexations. Phyllis Torrey Las Vegas Candidate projection Trying to walk back her “basket of deplorables” comment about Donald Trump supporters, Hillary Clinton talks about how the Trump campaign is based on “paranoia and prejudice.” Last month, Harry Reid commented that there aren’t enough uneducated white male voters to beat Hillary Clinton in Nevada. There is a psychological phenomenon known as “projection.” Paranoia? Hillary Clinton is the one who talks about “the vast right wing conspiracy.” Prejudice? It is obvious from Sen. Reid’s comments that he has a prejudice against white men, and Hillary Clinton’s prejudice is probably based on her husband’s marital and extra-marital conduct. Are the white males uneducated? In my case, educated enough to be at early voting on Oct. 22. Then, I can do my bit to send Hillary Clinton to the ash heap of history. Harry Reid is smart enough to go on his own. Richard C.

Its replacement will open at Viking Court, near Wyoming Boulevard across from Verda James Elementary School. “We are relocating the depot to city-owned property,” the city’s solid waste manager Cynthia Langston said in a news release. “Walmart has been very generous in allowing us to have our recycling depot located there until we could arrange for a permanent location,” Langston said. These are the other recycling depots in Casper: Wyoming Boulevard near the west entrance to the Central Wyoming Fairgrounds. Rocky Mountain Discount Sports. Paradise Valley pool. Meals on Wheels. North Casper soccer fields in the east parking lot along K Street. Huber Park. The Balefill. All depots have self-serve bins for cardboard, white paper, newspaper, magazines, number one and number two plastic bottles, aluminum cans, and glass, Langston said. “All these commodities, with the exception of glass, are taken to Wyoming Recycling and sold for recycling, while the glass is crushed and reused at the solid waste facility,” she said.

Wendy Russell Macrorie had been shopping at the store in Shawnee, Kansas, US, on Sunday when a bloody shoot-out erupted outside. The horrifying incident began when a 39-year-old woman was ambushed by two men and hit with an object. Two Good Samaritans rushed to her aid, but one of the attackers, John W. Simmons III, spun round and shot one of them several times. The other man then whipped out his gun and fatally shot Simmons. Simmons's victim was rushed to hospital, where he remains in critical condition today. Wendy Russell Macrorie has been criticised after filming a dead body in a Walmart car park (Photo: Facebook / Wendy Russell Macrone) The man who fatally shot Simmon's was interviewed by police but later released without charge. Simmons's accomplice is believed to still be on the run. But one Walmart shopper has been criticised after she posted footage of the aftermath of the incident on Facebook - which has since been taken down.

Wendy was criticised for smiling in the footage (Photo: Facebook / Wendy Russell Macrone) "Apparently right in front of my car two men have been shot. I was inside buying some light bulbs and stuff — an inner tube for my son for his bike, and everybody was telling everybody not to go outside. " So you be careful when you're going to Walmart. This is really scary and insane and grotesque, and I am freaked out." At the end of the video Macrorie said, "Gross, gross — don't come to Walmart!"

Shawnee police said 27-year-old Arthur Fred Wyatt III of Overland Park was charged in Johnson County District Court with attempted first-degree murder, attempted aggravated kidnapping and attempted aggravated robbery. A 39-year-old Kansas City, Kan., woman who had been shopping at the Wal-Mart at Shawnee Mission Parkway and Maurer Road was attacked in the parking lot about 1:30 p.m. Sunday. Two men approached her while she was putting her child in a safety seat, police said. She was struck in the head. A Good Samaritan tried to intervene, and one of the attackers shot him. A second Good Samaritan then shot one of the attackers, killing him. The other attacker escaped on foot. A man who fit that person’s description was detained but later released. Wyatt was arrested Tuesday. Shawnee police spokesman Maj. Dan Tennis said he could not discuss details of the arrest because the case was now in the hands of the district attorney. The Good Samaritan who was shot, a 33-year-old Kansas City man, remained in serious condition in a hospital Tuesday morning. The woman who was attacked was released from a hospital on Monday. The attacker who was killed was identified Monday as 28-year-old John W.

Christopher Michael Ono, 25, is charged with second-degree felony theft, as well as misdemeanor charges of possession of a controlled substance and possession of drug paraphernalia. Ono made his first appearance in 3rd District Court Monday morning before Judge Robert Adkins. He was appointed a public defender and bail was set at $15,000. On Sept. 7, Tooele City police were dispatched to the Walmart in Tooele in reference to a report of a stolen vehicle that had been located in the store’s parking lot, according to a probable cause statement. The car had been listed as stolen out of West Valley City in the National Crime Information Center database. When Tooele City police officers arrived on scene, they located the car and found Ono inside, the statement said. When officers searched Ono prior to his arrest, they found a white, crystalline substance, suspected to be methamphetamine. A subsequent search of the vehicle located a backpack that contained drug paraphernalia, including tin foil, a glass pipe with burn residue, syringes and small plastic baggies, according to the statement. Police also found files and pry tools, such as those used to conduct burglaries, inside the backpack. A filed piece of silverware with tape wrapped around one end was located in the ignition of the stolen car, according to police. Ono is expected back in 3rd District Court on Oct. 4 at 9 a.m. for a roll call hearing before Adkins.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it A Walmart in Hyattsville, Md. (Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post) By Arelis R. Hernández September 13 Follow @arelisrhdz Prince George’s County Council members voted Tuesday to block Walmart’s proposed expansion of a store in Landover Hills, reversing a decision by the county Planning Board that had sparked an outcry from community activists. Council member Dannielle M. Glaros (D-Riverdale Park), in whose district the Walmart is located, said the 35,200-square-foot extension was too large to be approved by county planning officials and should have undergone a more thorough screening. A day after a public hearing was held on the matter, Glaros made a motion to reject the Planning Board’s approval, and council members — who act as the District Council on land-use matters — voted unanimously in favor. Walmart can appeal the council’s decision in court or pursue expansion approval through the county’s special-exception process — a more rigorous zoning review that allows regulators to more closely examine the project details and creates more opportunity for public input. Neighborhood and community activists have long complained about security and conditions in and around the big-box store in the 6200 block of Annapolis Road. Prince George’s County Council member Dannielle M. Glaros (D-Riverdale Park) (Courtesy of Danielle Glaros's campaign) They said that, although Walmart promised to help spur additional development around the store when it sought to open there 10 years ago, new retail offerings have been sparse, and some well-regarded stores have shut down. Walmart said its efforts were slowed by the Great Recession and pointed out that some new stores are coming. It said the proposed expansion would make possible a much fuller grocery section to help make up for the departure of a Safeway. Denise Hamler, who leads a coalition of organizations dedicated to upholding the decade-old agreement between the community and Walmart, said she was “thrilled” at the council’s action. “We have been working on this for years,” Hamler said. “We cannot support an expansion until they respond to our issues with the current store.” But Walmart spokesman Phillip Keene said in a statement Tuesday evening that “there is a lot to like about our plan and, most importantly, our customers have told us they want the improvements. “We were ready to invest in the store and the community, so we’re pretty disappointed in today’s decision,’’ Keene said. “At this time, we are reviewing our options in terms of next steps.” local md-politics Orlando Shooting Updates News and analysis on the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. post_newsletter348 follow-orlando false after3th false Please provide a valid email address.

Whenever I go to Exton Mall, I usually head first to Chico’s, where the name of the store is printed on the labels of its blouses, skirts, slacks and dresses. At Wal-Mart near Kennett Square, I start shopping at aisles filled with food items from well-known food manufacturers such as Kraft Foods. During occasional jaunts through Concord Pets in Dilworthtown, I initially look at products from well-known dealers. Iams small chunks anyone? In other words, I am extremely wary about buying no-name products. Advertisement I know, I know, I know. Generic products at the CVS and Wegman’s stores in Chester County sometimes surpass big-name brands. But I’m not buying it. My preference for well-known labels over generic merchandise stems from numerous experiences over the years where a copycat item failed to measure up to my expectations. Have you ever tried mystery ice cream trying to compete with Breyer’s and Ben and Jerry’s on price rather than quality? Case closed. As a brand aficionado, I have been intrigued in recent years as the concept has expanded to encompass human beings as well as inanimate products. According to innumerable business gurus, you are expected to apply the term “brand” to yourself as a verb, as an adjective and as a noun – a significant grammatical as well as business challenge. What do I mean? Specifically, you need to brand yourself, to become branded and to establish yourself as a brand. The pressure is enough to make you run out for a Dunkin Donut or Starbucks coffee just to quiet your emotions. So what exactly is personal branding? “It’s about unearthing what is true and unique about you and letting everyone know about it,” writes David Tyreman in a book called “World Famous: How to Give Your Business and You a Kick-Ass Brand Identity.” “As a brand, you are a free agent. You have the freedom to create the career path that links your talents and interests with the right position and the ability to move both vertically and horizontally now and throughout your career.” So how exactly do you go about branding yourself? Here are a few ideas: • Expand your vision. The first step is to stop looking at yourself as an employee. You are more, much more, than your current job. Everything you do today as a corporate executive, a nonprofit director or a fledging entrepreneur will stay with you throughout your career. The days of working from graduation to retirement at the same company are screeching to a halt. • Zone in on your strengths. Turning yourself into a brand takes planning. Before proceeding to enumerate your best qualities, you need to figure out what they are, through any one of a combination of techniques. Take a formal assessment such as the Myers Briggs Type Indicator. Ask family and friends about your best traits. Think about tasks and roles that make you feel satisfied with your contribution to the world. Afterward, compile the information to get a sense of a viable brand. • Pinpoint your uniqueness. Usually, it’s a combination of factors; you are a one-of-a-kind package deal. Let’s say you landscape properties in upscale Westtown Township. And you have a passion for installing waterfalls on front lawns. Plus you have a horticulture degree from a well-known college. Put those characteristics together and you might come up with a brand statement such as “I am a landscaper with a degree in horticulture who will build a cascading fountain in your yard to enhance the beauty and value of your home.” • Identify the benefits you provide. Sound like sales? You bet. If you repair high-end electronic equipment, for instance, I suggest you create a brand statement focusing on the payoff to your customer rather than to yourself. An example: “My staff and I will be in your home or office to fix your computer within 48 hours of your call.” Your prospect then has hope that they will be back on line sometime this week, not next month or, heaven forbid, next year. • Tap into social media. Linked In. Facebook. Twitter. Instagram. Wordpress. You need to be visible on all of these computer platforms and more. Now that setting up your own website is easier than ever, do it now. In a book called “Branding: How to Use Social Media to Invent or Reinvent Yourself,” authors Erik Deckers and Kyle Lacey advise you to create an intriguing autobiography to post online. “The important part of building a personal brand is telling your story,” Deckers and Lacey write. “In fact, that’s the phrase you’ll hear over and over from personal branding and social media experts. Tell your story.” • Establish your live presence. In my view, nothing sets you up as an authority more than speaking to groups such as the Rotary or Kiwanis Clubs. Forget about getting paid for your talk. With any luck, you’ll be compensated later in sales to your listeners. If you are opening a chain of beauty salons, for instance, try to book gigs where you can demonstrate the latest hairstyles in PowerPoint slides or, better yet, on people in the audience. • Revisit marketing concepts. The steps used in personal branding require many of the same tactics as product branding. Packaging yourself. Developing a slogan. Seeking new opportunities. “Regardless of age, regardless of position, regardless of the business we happen to be in, all of us need to understand the importance of branding,” writes Tom Peters in a recent article in Fast Company magazine. “We are the CEOs of our companies. To be in business today, our most important job is to be head marketer for the brand called ‘You.’” Kathleen Begley of East Goshen owns Write Company Plus.

He’s been my colleague for the three years I’ve worked at The Atlantic, and in that time, there have been a lot of chats in our work Slack-room about video games and Soylent and Tab and typewriters and the new iPhone’s missing headphone jack. He also edits Object Lessons, a series that goes super in-depth on the history and meaning of things, like cardigans and meatballs. So it’s not surprising to those who know him that his newest book, Play Anything, is mostly about stuff, all the stuff that makes up the world, from the duct tape at Walmart with the boys of One Direction printed on it to his lawnmower. (He talks about his lawnmower a lot.) By paying attention to this stuff instead of just dismissing it, we can find meaning, he says. Rather than turning ever more and more inward, if we get out of our heads and pay attention to the abundance of stuff in the world, we learn things and make discoveries. According to Bogost, that’s what it means to play with things. (This applies to intangible things, too, like relationships or ideas.) In this way, play, he says, is a defense against irony and meaninglessness. “This demand to make something wholly from nothing, by sheer force of will,” is eating away at us, he writes. Instead, he suggests that “you accept that meaning can come from outside of you rather than from within. Perhaps, even, that it must.” I spoke with Bogost about what fun and play mean for adults, and how taking the world as it is instead of struggling against it can provide some relief. An edited and condensed transcript of our conversation is below. Julie Beck: I see now why you wanted me to be the one to interview you about this book, because you start from the premise that the universe is indifferent and life is an unending hellscape of disappointment and we have to find a way to get through it anyway! And that is 100 percent my thing. Ian Bogost: [Laughs]   Beck: You really zero in on a big problem in our culture: [The belief that] you are supposed to be able to somehow generate everything you need to be happy and content from within yourself. Bogost: It’s interesting because it’s a very secular worldview. It’s not that you’re looking to God, and it's also not that you're looking to some other source of outside meaning, and we have those sources—our families or our jobs. But the modern world is very wealthy, it's full of options. It’s not like “This is the land I was born on and I have to make the most of it, and these are the people who are near me, and so they will become my family.” We have so many choices that it's only always our fault if we’re malcontent. Beck: The answer to every dissatisfaction always seems to be to just work more on yourself, or take better care of yourself. Practice gratitude, or exercise more, or take more baths. Just change how you feel. If you’re lonely, just figure out how to enjoy being alone more! If you can’t have the things you want, just don't want those things anymore! Related Story Can This App Make Me Happier? Bogost: We’re so trained to think of life that way, that it circles around us as individuals. Our ideas of happiness, gratification, contentment, satisfaction, all demand that those feelings come from within us. If you flip that on its head and say “What if I took the world at face value?” and then ask “What can I do with what is given?” it’s an interesting trick to turn around the whole problem of how you feel. Beck: The way you define “fun” and “play” in the book aren’t the ways that most people would define them off the top of their heads. Can you explain what you mean by them? Bogost: I think the most important way to understand play is that it's this property that's in things. Like there’s play in a mechanism. For example, there’s some play in the steering column before it engages as you're turning the wheel. Beck: Play as a noun rather than a verb? Bogost: That's an interesting way of thinking about it. Play is this process of operating the world, of manipulating things. It's related to experimentation, and it's related to pleasure, but not defined by it. Normally we think of play as the opposite of work. Work is the thing you have to do, and then there's play, the thing you choose to do. But if you think of play as being in things, there are things that are playable, then it becomes the work of figuring out what a thing can do. “For me, what fun means is finding novelty in the suffocating familiarity of ordinary life.” Beck: Quick sidebar: What do you think of the phrase "Work hard, play hard?" Bogost: Any phrase that suggests play is this domain that’s the opposite of work, or the thing that you do when you're done working, should trouble us. Because it means that play is always relegated to the exhaust of life. It's the thing that you do after you do the important stuff, it's what you do on your own time. Play becomes a distraction, something you don't really need to do. It's not for serious people. They work hard, they don't play hard. Yes, you can say play hard, but that really means, keep working hard, right? Beck: It usually means drink. Bogost: Right, it means people get totally drunk and go do foolish things. I think this dichotomy or opposition between work and play, between leisure and serious stuff, is definitely a bad way of thinking about the useful insights that play provides. You can experience play at work, not because you’re messing around or wasting time or something, but because you’re looking really deeply and seriously at things and asking what is possible, what can be done with them, what new ideas might emerge? Beck: Then can you define fun? Bogost: The problem with fun is we really don’t know what fun means at all. If you stop someone who's talking about something being fun, and say “Well what do you mean?” it’s almost impossible to answer. Generally speaking, when people use the word fun, it's like a placeholder. You know, “How was your evening?” “Oh it was fun.” For me, what fun means is finding novelty in the suffocating familiarity of ordinary life. Every now and then if you try, you can discover something new. When we use this word fun, it sort of bangs up the ordinary and the extraordinary altogether. Fun has to do with habitual activities but then also terrifically novel or unusual ones. It works as a sort of strange milkshake of those concepts. When we think about play and games and the situations in which having fun is seen as an outcome, they often have to do with repetition. You're returning to something again, and even despite that similarity, you squeeze something new out of it. Beck: So can it be both novel and horrible? Can a fresh horror be fun? Bogost: Fun doesn’t have anything to do with pleasure, necessarily. I think this will be terrifically unintuitive for people. Because we're used to thinking of fun as a sort of synonym for light pleasure.  A fun movie is something that is pleasurable without being demanding, you don't have to think too hard. But if you think about the contexts in which we talk about things being fun, often there’s a certain kind of misery or effort that's involved with it. The difficulty of travel, getting all your bags packed and your work done and navigating the airports and all that. That sort of struggle. With sports and games, you have fun despite working very hard, even despite failing repeatedly. Even the fun of a night out, you have to get somewhere and do all the conversational, social work of being out. There's effort involved. But then when you're finished, you can conclude, “Actually there was something gratifying about the hardship that I just encountered.” That discovery of novelty is where the molten core of fun is. There's a whole bunch of stuff about mowing the lawn in the book. It’s an example I love because it’s the kind of thing that no one would intuitively call a fun experience, but then when you do it you discover something you haven’t seen before. Maybe this way of using my equipment will produce better results, or when the weather's like this I have to respond in that way. It's almost like, the more you’re drowning in familiarity, the better the fun is. It requires less novelty to produce even more gratification. And it's something that didn't come from you. It was about the other thing—the thing you were experiencing, or the people you were with, or the mechanism you were operating, or whatever it might be. It wasn’t you who had to come up with that meaning. It was given to you by the world. You allow yourself to discover the things that are already there when you play. Beck: A lot of times you do see articles where people are complaining that adults don’t play anymore. And it’s weird because often those arguments are like, “Remember when you used to run around your backyard and pretend to be a princess or a cowboy? Isn’t it so awful that you don't do that anymore, and you’ve lost that creativity and freedom?” But I don't want to run around and pretend to be a princess. I'm not sad that I don't do that anymore. So what does play mean for adults? I mean, some adults LARP. But other than LARPing, how do we play? Bogost: I think what you’re honing in on is that you don't want to be told, “Hey, do whatever you want.” That's what we think of when we think of play. It’s the thing where you get to do whatever you come up with in your own mind, all bets are off, there's no boundaries. But even when we tell kids to go play, what do the kids do? They come up with a set of constraints and structures. “Oh, we’re gonna build a fort out of clothes, and now that we're in the fort we're going to pretend that we're prisoners,” or whatever. The whole idea of play is in finding, acknowledging, and then working with the natural constraints and limitations that you find in the world. “The playful perspective is not meant to turn your life into a game or a jungle gym. It’s rather that the activity is looking outside of yourself.” I think the most important thing to realize about play is that it's this thing that's in stuff, it’s not in you. Play isn't you being clever, or finding a trick, or finding a way of covering over your own misery, or persuading someone to do what you want. It's the process of working with the materials that you find and discovering what's possible with them. Beck: So you do stuff and then you sit back and see what happens. Bogost: What happens and then what do you learn? Once you turn that corner it’s not even necessary to say “I’m playing,” the verb isn’t important. The playful perspective is not meant to turn your life into a game or a jungle gym. It’s rather that the activity is looking outside of yourself. Beck: You mention this in the book, how people talk about making things fun, or gamifying things, as a way to make shitty tasks less shitty. So it’s just in service of doing more work. Bogost: I definitely think that's one of the ways people have misused these notions of play and fun. We think we want enjoyment, and that enjoyment is incompatible with work, and somehow we have to import the pleasure into these miserable experiences. That takes for granted that there’s not fun or play to be found in the work itself. We have to always spread sugar on top of it in order that we can tolerate swallowing the things we’re supposed to do, which is an incredibly depressing way of thinking about living your life. Not just that your work or your home life would be so miserable that you have to slather sugar on it, but then the sugar is all you’re tasting. If that's the only way that I'm finding meaning, then we have this sort of mental diabetes that we're descending into. Beck: I listen to podcasts while I clean, or I watch Netflix while I'm folding my laundry. Am I doing it wrong? Bogost: Well, maybe, maybe not. Everyone is different. But I think that is a good example of an opportunity to stop and say, “What would it be like if I took this thing for what it is rather than trying to slather that Mary Poppins sugar on top of it?” It’s not so much that there's some sort of Protestant work ethic that dictates that you must not watch Netflix while folding your laundry, but rather that the experience of folding laundry also has its own pleasure. That might just be like “Oh I know the size and shape of these garments and I can get better at folding them into neat piles.” Or the individual packing of the dishes into the dishwasher such that they are efficiently inserted but yet not so full that they don’t clean properly. These are dumb things. They're silly things. We think they couldn’t possibly be as interesting as listening to that interview on the podcast, or watching Netflix. Until you realize that actually a lot of the supposedly serious and meaningful and worthwhile content on the podcast or on the television is no more or less meaningful than the clothes in the laundry basket or the dishes in the sink. It's more a matter of the attention you’re willing to bring to them, where you’re willing to allow meaning and pleasure and the light to escape. It’s not even that finding laundry pleasurable or delightful should be our goal rather than finding television delightful. It's that both laundry and television can be delightful. And once you get yourself on that path where you're willing to find something delightful in laundry and in dishwashers, it means that you train yourself to be able to find it almost anywhere in almost anything. And wouldn't we all rather have the possibility of finding pleasure and delight in literally anything we might encounter? Instead of assuming that actually there are only these three things where pleasure and delight are possible. Like oh, it’s television and socialization and work, and then everything else is  the smoke I have to somehow choke my way through in order to get to the good parts. Beck: Nothing is more fun than television! Bogost: I kind of agree. Beck: I get it in terms of like objects, but a lot of people’s sadness comes from more ephemeral things. They want to make more friends, or they’re dating and it sucks. How do you “play” with these intangible things? Bogost: It feels gross to talk about people with the same kinds of language that we talk about things with, but you and me and everyone, there are things about us that make us who we are, personality traits, or capacities that we have, or knowledge we possess or that we don’t possess, habits we have that are good or bad. Normally if you're dating, you’re looking for compatibility, and then the moment that there's incompatibility, you're like, “Well, swipe left on that, let’s just keep looking.” In some ways I think the same lessons apply to people that apply to objects. It’s just much easier to see that lesson in things because they're these fixed intangible lumps of stuff. People are not. They can change. My lawnmower can’t change in the way that my son can or that I can. But the idea of thinking of our relationships with people as also being structured by limitations and constraints can be useful. “This willingness to be frank and plain about the way that the world is, is a good first step. But that doesn’t mean that you get what you want.” I'll just give you one example. This is going to sound rudimentary. My wife, there's certain kinds of housework that she just doesn’t see as necessary to do in the way that I do. Things like the state of our closet or where things are in the kitchen. I have this almost unhealthily obsessive desire to have things in their place and she just totally doesn’t. And this is a potential point of conflict, of course. But there are also many things she can’t stand about me, and there are certain capacities that she has that are different than mine. The trick is to find compatibilities, and it's just much easier for me to do the chores that I can find tolerable, that bring me bizarre pleasure. Like the dishwasher, or whatever it is. It’s allowing those properties of individuals to structure your relationship with them. This produces a greater depth of understanding and empathy. There are personality traits, or baggage from their backgrounds, goals that they have and the first thing I need to do is understand and then acknowledge and then accept those properties. That's kind of the baseline requirement to have a productive relationship. I think fundamentally this honesty, this willingness to be frank and plain about the way that the world is, is a good first step. But that doesn’t mean that you get what you want. Forcing your spouse to stop doing that bad habit that drives you crazy, or making your kid be better at math or at art or at swimming, or making your parents or your in-laws not be annoying in the way that they're annoying, these are sometimes doomed goals. The question becomes not how can I change someone, or how can I change myself? But what about me doesn't change? What is true about someone else's nature? How can I work within those limits, how can I respect them, how can I understand them? Which doesn’t mean being happy about it. Then I'm not worried so much about “maybe this time will be different.” No, it won't be. Beck: It never will be. There's this quote from this Jesse Ball book, and I definitely quoted it when I interviewed Heather Havrilesky, so sorry for double dipping, but I seriously think about it all the time. It says: I believe in discovering the love that exists and then trying to understand it. Not to invent a love and try to make it exist, but to find what does exist, and then to see what it is. I think about this in terms of relationships, yes, but also in terms of trying to write a story: You try to find what exists and you try to see what it is. Even though I think about that all the time, I’m really bad at doing it. Bogost: It’s hard because we have been trained to think we have enormous power over the world. Whatever you dream, you can do. Anything can be bent to your will. But actually isn't it much more interesting to imagine that you’re quite small? Not in a powerless way, but there’s so much that is not you. There's just an enormous vast universe of possible intrigue out there and why not pay attention to it? Because then you're not burdened with trying to find that meaning in yourself all the time. Part of the reason is that the universe is not particularly concerned with you. We don’t like to think of ourselves as subject to the forces of the world, we like to think of ourselves as exerting that force. I think a lot of the misery that people experience comes from that sensation of boundlessness, of infinite possibility. We’re stuck in these situations with other people and our stuff and our jobs, and thinking that we can extract ourselves from those seems doomed to me. Instead, how can we live within those systems of constraints? We don’t have to enjoy them, exactly, but at least acknowledge that those boundaries are real and that they structure our response to the world. And then once you do that, you allow yourself to say “I did my best given the circumstances.” It releases you from the burden of thinking of all the infinity of things that you could have done or all the ways the world could be different. Beck: The thing I appreciate about this idea is that it's sort of in the middle of two weird tendencies that humans have. One is what we've been talking about this whole time, which is you just struggle so hard to try to make things happen the way you want them to and obviously that's never going to work. But then the other side of that, and this tends to be sometimes a more religious thing, is, “Oh you should just accept what is handed to you or just accept that that is the plan of the universe.” And you’re sort of saying, you can do what you can with what you have, but you're not going to change the whole world with it. Bogost: Yeah, there's some kind of happy medium here. There’s some sort of meeting point, and to me that meeting point is much closer to the world than it is to you. The actual effort that you can exert upon the universe is fairly limited. So it’s helpful to be prepared to celebrate the tiny things that you can do, where you meet the world and you negotiate an outcome that’s quite tiny. But you can still make it feel remarkable. It’s a lot like the stupid example of lawnmowing, because no one wakes up and says, “Yay I get to mow the lawn!” But if I can find meaning there, then there’s nowhere I can’t find meaning. It’s not that we’re out of control. It’s not fatalistic. It’s not something where the thing that I am meant to do will be given to me. God will not speak to me and tell me to mow my lawn today. But if you start the day not really expecting substantial change, but anticipating some small new revelation or some small alteration, then over time you’re able to find them in more places. To me, being able to find gratification in more venues, rather than greater gratification in a few, seems like a much more sane way of living. We know exactly where the path to despair and insanity lies. It's in that sense that life is meaningless, there's nothing about today that's worth doing because it's just like yesterday and it's going to be just like tomorrow. But I think for everyone, nowadays in particular, it becomes harder and harder to deal with that day-to-day, and so looking for meaning in the ordinary seems like the most urgent thing that we can do.

Twitter Email previousThe Free-Time Paradox in AmericanextHow Donald Trump Exploited Charity for Personal Gain Most Popular Presented by Mike Segar/ Reuters Donald Trump's Choice for National Security Adviser Has One Priority: Combatting 'Radical Islamic Terorrism' Krishnadev Calamur Michael Flynn is also known for his long military career and his unceremonious exit from the Defense Intelligence Agency. Michael Flynn, the retired Army lieutenant general and former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) whom Donald Trump has reportedly picked to be his national security adviser, is known for his long and distinguished military career, his unceremonious exit from the DIA, and for his controversial views on Islam, torture, and Russia. Flynn, a registered Democrat, was an early and ardent supporter of Trump’s improbable presidential run, giving the Republican presidential hopeful a much-needed endorsement from the national-security establishment. He led crowds at Trump’s rallies to chant “Lock her up” about Hillary Clinton, Trump’s Democratic opponent. “Donald Trump is about the future of this country and making sure that we take a direction … that puts us back on a track that we can continue to be the global leader around the world,” he told Fox Business Network in July. Continue Reading Bettman / Getty Progress Isn't Natural Joel Mokyr Humans invented it—and not that long ago. How and why did the modern world and its unprecedented prosperity begin? Many bookshelves are full of learned tomes by historians, economists, political philosophers and other erudite scholars with endless explanations. One way of looking at the question is by examining something basic, and arguably essential: the emergence of a belief in the usefulness of progress. Such a belief may seem self-evident today, but most people in the more-remote past believed that history moved in some kind of cycle or followed a path that was determined by higher powers. The idea that humans should and could work consciously to make the world a better place for themselves and for generations to come is by and large one that emerged in the two centuries between Christopher Columbus and Isaac Newton. Of course, just believing that progress could be brought about is not enough—one must bring it about. The modern world began when people resolved to do so.               Continue Reading Jacky Naegelen / Reuters The Problem With Abandoning the Paris Agreement Robinson Meyer Bill O’Reilly and Barack Obama agree: President-Elect Trump shouldn’t walk away from the first international climate treaty. If the Trump administration withdraws the United States from the Paris Agreement, the country would face a massive global diplomatic backlash and permanently cede worldwide leadership on climate and renewable-energy issues to China, experts warn. Withdrawing from the treaty “would be a huge mistake, even forgetting about climate change,” said Todd Stern, the former U.S. special envoy on climate change. He added that it would have “radiating bad impacts with respect to U.S. standing” on all other international issues. We know very little for sure about the Trump administration’s foreign policy. So far, he has seemed to choose Russia-friendly advisors like General Michael Flynn, and he has not backed down from previous threats of a trade war with China. If the U.S. were to renege on its NATO commitments or enter a battle of tariffs with China, this could so remake global order that climate would slide off the international agenda. Continue Reading Pablo Martinez Monsivais / AP Will Trump Be Ready to Govern? Russell Berman The early days of his transition have looked like chaos, but veterans of the process say the president-elect has time to catch up. This was not exactly how the 2016 presidential transition was supposed to go. For years, legislators, civil servants, good-government advocates, and veterans of the last several administrations had been preparing for this very moment. Congress had passed two new laws allowing the two major-party nominees to begin planning earlier than ever, and the Obama administration was committed to handing off the baton of government in full stride. The singular goal was to make this transfer of presidential power the smoothest, most effective transition in U.S. history. Then came the unexpected victory of Donald Trump to blow it all to bits. The Trump transition has looked, from the outside, like a mess. Days after winning the presidency, the new president-elect abruptly replaced the man who for months had been running his transition efforts, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, with the soon-to-be vice president, Mike Pence. Other departures quickly followed in what was described as “a purge” of people close to Christie. The leadership swap caused an important paperwork snafu, delaying by several days the point when Trump’s “landing teams” of potential appointees could begin on-the-job training at federal departments and agencies. A former national-security official in Republican administrations, Eliot Cohen, emerged from a single conversation with the transition team only to warn others to stay away. One of Trump’s first appointments, chief strategist Steve Bannon, prompted a firestorm of criticism over his website’s links to white nationalism. Leaks flowed out of Trump Tower faster than transition staff could plug them, while the president-elect himself sneaked away from his press corps for an evening out at the 21 Club in Manhattan.

At a glance, Million Dollar Extreme Presents: World Peace seems like typical fare for Adult Swim, the alternative, late-night comedy channel that airs on the Cartoon Network after 9 p.m. One of a coterie of bizarre series on the channel, the show lurches from one surreal, sometimes violent, sketch to the next, and describes itself as being set in an “almost present-day, post-apocalyptic nightmare world.” But Million Dollar Extreme, which premiered in August, is also from the mind of Sam Hyde, an unapologetic member of the alt-right. Hyde crafts his comedy with the goal of shocking his young, liberal, Millennial audience while simultaneously appealing to like-minded members of a white-nationalist movement that generally supports Donald Trump.

Alana Semuels So-called activist investors are increasingly gaining control of legacy corporations, forcing them to trim payrolls and downsize research operations—and, quite possibly, damaging the entire economy. WILMINGTON, Del.—Ron Ozer was thrilled to get a job with DuPont, the two-centuries-old chemical company, when he finished his Ph.D. from Cornell in 1990. It was the place to go for young, ambitious chemists; it offered salary and benefits so generous that some people called it “Uncle Dupey.” For 26 years, he invented things for DuPont, filing patent after patent, working on renewable plastic bottles and polymers from the company’s Experimental Station, a research lab where Kevlar, Neoprene, and nylon were all invented. Then, in January of this year, he was abruptly fired, along with hundreds of other employees at the Experimental Station, part of a company-wide wave of 1,700 layoffs, one-third of DuPont’s Delaware workforce. Globally, DuPont cut 10 percent of its workforce, or 5,000 people in early 2016.

What does its darkening political climate—and growing belligerence—mean for the United States? What if China is going bad? Since early last year I have been asking people inside and outside China versions of this question. By “bad” I don’t mean morally. Moral and ethical factors obviously matter in foreign policy, but I’m talking about something different. Nor is the question mainly about economics, although for China the short-term stability and long-term improvement of jobs, wages, and living standards are fundamental to the government’s survival. Under China’s single-party Communist arrangement, sustained economic failure would naturally raise questions about the system as a whole, as it did in the Soviet Union. True, modern China’s economic performance even during its slowdowns is like the Soviet Union’s during its booms. But the absence of a political outlet for dissatisfaction is similar.

The carts will be equipped with detachable motors that have sensors and video cameras. Customers will be able to request a cart using a “user interface device”, potentially a smartphone, and the roaming motors will be able to fetch a cart and bring it to a customer. The system will be able to identify an unattended shopping cart and return it to a docking station. There is no word yet on when or where Walmart intends to start using the system.

His name sells books and magazines. So if you’re looking for investment advice, you might think he’s the guy to follow. But while Buffett is a pro at what he does, his investment strategy isn’t right for everyone. Before you imitate his path to wealth, here are six reasons why you shouldn’t duplicate Buffett’s investment strategy. everything possible / Shutterstock.com 1. You Need a Personalized Investment Strategy No hard-and-fast rules exist when it comes to investing. The strategy that works for someone like Buffett might not work for you. And if you attempt to imitate his investment style, you could lose more than you bargained for. “Mr. Buffett has been quoted as saying, ‘There is more than one way to get to heaven.’ And, what he means by that is not everyone has to adopt the same investment strategy to be successful,” said Robert R. Johnson, president and CEO of The American College of Financial Services in Bryn Mawr, Pa. Johnson pointed out that Buffett is a value investor who historically has looked for undervalued securities before taking very large positions in them. “But not all of us have the time, inkling or ability to replicate Mr. Buffett’s investing style,” said Johnson. “He is actually on the record as saying his style is not for everyone.” The right investment strategy has everything to do with your income and how much money you can afford to lose. So, choose a strategy based on your short-term and long-term goals.  The difference between the average Joe and Buffett is that Buffett can afford to take more risks. He has an estimated net worth of more than $67 billion, according to Bloomberg. So a handful of bad investments are not going to bleed him dry. Krista Kennell / Shutterstock.com 2. Warren Buffett Makes Investing Mistakes Buffett might be one of the best investors today, but he isn’t perfect. He’s had some good investments over the years — and some bad ones. For example, Buffett considered the purchase of Berkshire Hathaway — his holding company — a “monumentally stupid decision,” according to Fortune. Buffett bought into the troubled textile manufacturer more than 50 years ago because it was cheap. Berkshire Hathaway eventually became a successful investment partnership, but at a cost. Because Buffett had to dump a lot of money into the company, he referred to this investment as his “$100 million mistake.” In a 2004 Berkshire Hathaway Q&A session, Buffett revealed another mistake — waiting too long to buy into Walmart. An AOL News report quoted Buffett as saying: “I set out to buy $100 million shares of Walmart at a (pre-split price of) $23. We bought a little and it moved up a little, and I thought maybe it will come back a bit. That thumb sucking has cost us in the current area of $10 billion.” Find Out: 7 Investing Mistakes Warren Buffett Regrets The point is simple: Successful investors are humans, too, and they make mistakes. Imitation might be the sincerest form of flattery, but it’s never wise to copy a single investor’s style — even if that person is Buffett. Rawpixel.com / Shutterstock.com 3. You Don’t Have an Investment Team Buffett is a successful investor because he surrounds himself with other investors. He has a team he collaborates with, which includes former hedge fund managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler. Combs and Weschler each manage portfolios of about $9 billion, and their duties also include stock-picking. For example, Buffett didn’t have a hand in Berkshire Hathaway’s investment in Apple. Instead, his team spearheaded the deal. In all likelihood, you don’t have a team of advisors by your side. But you can receive guidance on a smaller scale. If you have questions or need to be pointed in the right direction, a financial advisor can help you choose the best investment strategy based on different factors, such as your age, risk tolerance and long-term plans. iStock.com / EdStock 4. You Lack Warren Buffett’s Experience Buffett has experience that most everyday investors lack. Some people don’t think about investing until their 20s, 30s or 40s. Buffett comes from a different breed of investors. He didn’t wait until he was older to develop an interest in money and business. He purchased his first stock at the age of 11. By the age of 15, he had a net worth of $6,000, MarketWatch reports. That was in 1945 and would be the equivalent of about $80,000 today. According to a 2014 Gallup survey of 946 investors — which included 576 nonretirees and 370 retirees — just 7 percent starting saving for retirement before age 20. So compared to the average investor, Buffett had a huge head start. And since his father owned an investment firm, he likely had a solid understanding of how different investments work from an early age. Learning about different investments takes time and a lot of research, especially if you want to put your money to work. You might not have as much experience as Buffett, but you can make solid investment decisions by educating yourself, listening to the advice of advisors and diversifying your portfolio to protect against market swings.

An investment consortium made up of Berkshire Hathaway and 3G Capital purchased Heinz for $72.50 a share in 2013, a transaction valued at $28 billion. Geico became a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway in 1996, and the company acquired The Pampered Chef in 2002. The more these companies are worth, the more Buffett is worth. Buying into a company can also be profitable for the average investor, but stock-picking is a risky business. Selecting a winner is not guaranteed. If you invest in the wrong company and its stock drops, you can lose a lot of money that you have invested. Unlike Buffett, your cushion might not be strong enough to absorb hits to your net worth. It might be safer to explore other types of short-term and long-term investments. “When it comes to investing there are two very different Warren Buffetts,” said Stephanie Genkin, a certified financial planner and founder of My Financial Planner in Brooklyn, N.Y. “Unfortunately, many investors emulate the wrong one and as a result, lose money.” Genkin said one Buffett is the Oracle of Omaha who buys good companies that are beaten down and out of favor. “And there is the lesser-known Buffett, who instructed the trustee of his estate to buy index funds,” Genkin said. “The second Buffett is the one investors should be following, not stock-picking Buffett.” wavebreakmedia / Shutterstock.com 6. You Have Limited Cash Flow Finally, you probably do not have enough assets to emulate Buffett. “It’s always good to follow in the footsteps of mega-rich investment moguls like Warren Buffett, but I do not recommend people model their entire portfolio after one,” said Josh Brein, a Bellevue, Wash.,-based financial advisor and founder and president of Brein Wealth Management. Brein said it’s hard to leverage the market like someone who has billions in net worth. Dabbing in different investments and diversifying your portfolio can help build a sizable net worth. But rather than invest like Buffett and follow in the footsteps of an investing guru, develop a strategy that is realistic for your situation. Doing so can lessen your risk and help maximize your return.

KAZINFORM The world's top ten corporations, including Apple, Shell and Walmart, have a combined revenue that is greater than the combined income of the 180 "poorest" countries out of the world's total 195 sovereign states. The figures, which reveal that Walmart, Apple and Shell alone are now richer than Russia, Belgium and Sweden, were released by the campaign group Global Justice Now. Sixty-nine of the world’s 100 top economic entities are now corporations instead of countries – a rise from last year’s staggering figure of 63. Out of the top 200 entities in the world, a whopping 153 were found to be corporations. The US, China, Germany, Japan, France and the UK comprise the top six economic entities followed by Italy, Brazil and Canada. “The vast wealth and power of corporations is at the heart of so many of the world’s problems – like inequality and climate change,” said Nick Dearden, director of Global Justice Now. “The drive for short-term profits today seems to trump basic human rights for millions of people on the planet. These figures show the problem is getting worse,” he added. The London-based campaign group released the figures in an effort to put increased pressure on the British government ahead of their working group with the UN. The meeting, led by Ecuador, was established with the aim of working towards a binding treaty that would ensure “transnational corporations abide by the full range of human rights responsibilities”. “The UK government has facilitated this rise in corporate power – through tax structures, trade deals and even aid programmes that help big business,” said Dearden. “Their wholehearted support for the US-EU trade deal TTIP, is just the latest example of government help to big business. Disgracefully it also routinely opposes the call of developing countries to hold corporations to account for their human rights impacts at the UN.”  Source: RT  Keywords: World News, : Read also Educational robot attacks man in China Terminally ill teen won historic ruling to preserve body 3 dead bodies found in central Japan home Man set himself on fire in Australia Black gold: Newly discovered Texas Oil Field could hold 20 bln barrels Mosul Iraq battle: Bad weather slows advance inside city News from dashboard.idealmedia.com Send Latest news Caspian countries to create common chart atlas of region’s geological content 20:30 Regions > Mangystau region 22 Educational robot attacks man in China 19:16 World News > World News 87 Tokayev met Ambassadors of Israel and Japan 18:16 Authorities and Policy > Parliament 97 India keen on trade development with EEU 17:29 Authorities and Policy > Integration 86 RoK Ombudsman told about Kazakhstan’s achievements in prevention of tortures in Geneva 17:04 World News > International Activity of Kazakhstan 97 -40°C frost to hit some regions at weekend 16:58 Regions > Regions 98 Regional Mass Media Alliance may be established in Kazakhstan 16:32 Regions > Regions 106 Improvement of ambulance service discussed in South Kazakhstan 16:06 Regions > South Kazakhstan region 106 KASE day session: USDKZT_TOD = 340.92 16:04 Economy and finance > Economy 99 Brazil to participate in 2017 Almaty Winter Universiade 15:57 Sport > 2017 Winter Universiade 97 Education Ministry to raise up to $100 M for scientific projects 15:34 Society > Education and Science 104 Terminally ill teen won historic ruling to preserve body 15:03 World News > World News 106 OANA General Assembly kicks off in Baku 14:43 Authorities and Policy > Integration 99 Kazakhstan, Singapore enjoy trust-based dialogue: Bilahari Kausikan 14:23 Regions > Astana 106 Halyk Bank comments on rumors about its merger with KKB 14:16 Economy and finance > Economy 107 Finland's Commissioner denies negative comments about EXPO pavilion collapse 13:59 Regions > Astana 131 3 dead bodies found in central Japan home 13:47 World News > World News 120 Man set himself on fire in Australia 13:20 World News > World News 114 Local content share in public procurements reached 58.3% in 2016 12:57 Economy and finance > Economy 100 Olympic champions join charity campaign for little Kazakhstanis 12:42 Regions > Astana 107 Kazakhstan ranks 94th in Global Terrorism Index 2016 12:24 131 Regional mass media can contribute to Kazakhstan's modernization - Abayev 12:12 Regions > Astana 103 Kazakhstan and Canada to intensify inter-parliamentary coop 11:56 World News > International Activity of Kazakhstan 122 OIC elects new Sec Gen 11:43 Authorities and Policy > Integration 124 KASE morning session: USDKZT_TOD = 341.33 (+0.11) 11:23 Economy and finance > Economy 112 New Vice Minister of Defense and Aerospace Industry appointed 11:06 Authorities and Policy > Government 109 American business interested in EEU 10:43 Authorities and Policy > Eurasian Economic Union 57 Flights delayed at airports in Astana, Almaty 10:19 Regions > Almaty 111 Load more Commented articles UNESCO heritage was discussed in Kyzylorda Regions > Kyzylorda region 0 Mazhilis and EU representatives discuss interpaliamentary partnership Authorities and Policy > Parliament 0 Portugal investor to build apartment house in Ayagoz, East Kazakhstan State programs and projects > Housing Construction Development 0 Gusty wind, black ice forecast for most regions of Kazakhstan Regions > Regions 0 Nazarbayev, Putin discuss situation in Syria World News > International Activity of Kazakhstan 0 Kazakhstan announces inflation forecast for 2017-2018 Economy and finance > Economy 0 Almaty to welcome November Music Fest international festival Regions > Almaty 0 Archive 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 January February March April May June July August September October November December 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 Terms of Use Vacancies Photo website About Kazinform Our partners Contacts State symbols Advertisement © 2016 Kazinform

All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. NEW YORK (CNNMoney) Walmart is planning to eventually have self-driving shopping carts roaming its stores and herding themselves out of the parking lot. The U.S. government granted Walmart a patent last week that indicates the company is planning to roll out a system that allows shopping carts to drive themselves. According to the patent request, the carts will be equipped with detachable motors that have sensors and video cameras. Customers will be able to request a cart using a "user interface device" -- potentially a smartphone -- and the roaming motors will be able to fetch a cart and bring it to a customer. And employees who are usually in charge of rounding up abandoned carts may be able to abandon that task. The system will, in theory, be able to identify an unattended shopping cart in a store or parking lot and return it to a docking station, according to the filing. The system may help the stores manage inventory. One portion of the filing describes a scenario in which the system receives a request for an item, searches an inventory database, then sends the motorized unit to a store shelf to ensure the product is there. There's no word yet on when or where Walmart intends to start using the system. A Walmart spokesperson was not able to immediately provide additional information.

SHARE Blotter, September 13, 2016 By Staff Monday, September 12, 2016 Accused flasher has history A 37-year-old man accused of flashing his Strive case manager was arrested Thursday and could be charged with felony indecent exposure. Joshua Dean Crum, who has a history of indecent exposure and public masturbation, was reportedly meeting the woman Thursday afternoon about some paperwork he needed to sign for the organization, according to an arrest warrant. The case manager reported that when she put the paper on her desk, Crum stepped forward, and she realized he was exposing himself, according to the report. The woman said she told him to get out, but said Crum had followed her back to her personal vehicle at one point, the report said. When contacted by Grand Junction police officers, Crum reportedly said he had “just forgot to put it away after he had gone to the bathroom,” the report said. Crum was issued a $2,000 cash bond Monday in county court.   Police tase suspect twice   A man who was twice hit with a Taser after allegedly taking a swing at a police officer’s face early Monday morning in the Walmart parking lot on North Avenue is being held in the Mesa County Jail in lieu of a $5,000 cash bond. Vince Joe Pacheco, 24, could be charged with felony counts of second-degree assault on a police officer and criminal attempt, as well as misdemeanor counts of obstructing a peace officer and third-degree criminal trespass. Officers wrote in an arrest affidavit that they saw Pacheco acting suspiciously around Walmart at about 3 a.m. Monday and he seemed to be trying to avoid them, so they addressed him. “I asked Pacheco how he was doing and he stated ‘I don’t have to talk to you,’ ” the report said. Officers told Pacheco to stop, and he said no several times before he “turned around, balled his right fist and swung at me attempting to punch me in the face,” the report said. The officer drew his weapon and chased Pacheco, eventually using his Taser twice, according to the affidavit. “Pacheco then began flopping on the ground having a ‘seizure’ as he claimed even though he was still yelling at me for Tasing him for no reason while having this seizure,” the report said. Pacheco was transported to the jail.   According to the Grand Junction Police Department: ■ Scott Gill, 30, was cited on suspicion of driving under the influence and other offenses Wednesday. ■ Travis Koncher, 27, was cited on suspicion of driving under the influence and careless driving Thursday. ■ Mitchell Wintrow, 26, is accused of theft Friday. ■ Blake Curtis, 26, Samuel Wentling, 29, and John Bigger, 31, were each cited on suspicion of disorderly conduct Saturday. ■ Someone stole a vehicle worth less than $100,000 and a handgun worth less than $2,000 from the 2800 block of Brittany Drive on Saturday. ■ Someone stole property worth between $200 and $300 from a vehicle in the 800 block of Noland Avenue on Sept. 3. ■ Matthew Barnard, 31, is accused of trespassing in vehicles, damaging them and stealing items at Action Rent A Car on Sept. 3. ■ Brett Spenneberg, 37, is accused of criminal impersonation on Sept. 5. ■ Someone stole property worth less than $2,000 from a trailer near Rio Grande Drive and Cumbres Court on Sept. 2. ■ Someone stole items from a garage in the 1700 block of North 26th Street on Sept. 5. ■ Someone cut a trailer padlock and stole tools and supplies worth less than $5,000 from a parking lot in the 500 block of 30 Road on Sept. 1. ■ Someone entered a refrigerated product dispensing machine and stole products worth between $300 and $750 on Wednesday. ■ Someone stole a vehicle worth less than $5,000 from the 1600 block of North 23rd Street on Thursday. ■ Someone stole a vehicle worth more than $20,000 from the 500 block of Redwing Lane on Friday. ■ Someone stole property worth less than $2,000 from vehicles in the 600 block of Little Rose Avenue on Thursday. ■ Someone broke a window and stole items worth less than $300 from a vehicle in the 2800 block of Hermosa Court on Thursday.   According to the Mesa County Sheriff’s Office: ■ Deputies responded to a criminal mischief report in the 4000 block of Horse Canyon Road on Aug. 12. ■ Deputies responded to a criminal mischief report in the 9000 block of Colorado Highway 65 on Aug. 26. ■ Alta Lamphier, 41, was cited on suspicion of disorderly conduct Sept. 2. ■ Deputies responded to a theft of a firearm in the 3100 block of 32 1/2 Road on Sept. 6. ■ Deputies took a report of a theft in the 3000 block of the Interstate 70 Business Loop on Sept. 1. ■ Deputies responded to a reported theft in the 500 block of 32 Road on Thursday. ■ Roger Knuckles, 32, is accused of possession of a controlled substance, a protection order violation, a bail-bond violation and traffic offenses Saturday.   According to the Montrose County Sheriff’s Office: ■ Brandon J.

Prev Next A request to rezone property along Alford Avenue in Bluff Park tonight received approval from the Hoover Planning and Zoning Commission. The request was submitted to rezone two parcels, totaling 8.96 acres, from an agricultural district to a Planned Residential Development district in order to accommodate 35 single-family homes. Joey Miller, a civil engineer representing the property owner, said the lots would be 75 feet wide and homes would be between 2,500 and 2,800 square feet, almost double the city’s required minimum size of 1,500 square feet for that zoning classification. Two years ago, the property owners proposed a plan to put a Walmart Neighborhood Market on the property in question, which is located near the corner of Alford Avenue and Tyler Road. However, they later withdrew the request after much opposition from the community. The land is surrounded by Bluff Park United Methodist Church and St. Luke Korean Catholic Church, estate zoning, townhomes, agricultural zoning and the Bluff Park Village shopping center. Miller said the single-family houses around Bluff Park Village and the townhomes across the street are both denser than the proposed development. “There are some single-family, large residential lots that are kind of caddy-corner across the street, but it’s kind of a mixed area right there,” he said. “To me this is a very good transitional zoning because we’re backing up to the church and to a commercial shopping center, so to me it’s a good use of the property.” Hoover resident Steve Ledger, who lives off of Shades Crest Road near the development, told the commission he believes the proposed development was too dense for what he described as a “mature, historic neighborhood.” The development could put a further strain on resources, including Bluff Park Elementary and the single-lane ingress and egress roads in that residential area, Ledger said. Miller previously said the proposed development is expected to generate 140 vehicle trips per day. Allowing a dense development could set a poor precedent for infill development, Ledger added. “If Hoover Country Club, of which I’m a member, were to go bankrupt, as many golf clubs are doing these days such as Altadena, how would we look at the development there? If we took this precedent, can we imagine how many home sites would be built there?,” Ledger said. Sid Lassiter, a resident of the Tyler Crest Townhomes across the street from the proposed development, said while they did not oppose the development, he and other residents had concerns. Their main concerns included stormwater runoff and maintaining a “reasonably safe” access to the townhomes, Lassiter said. A gully behind the townhomes fills in current storms, he said, and residents worry it will overflow with excess runoff. Lassiter added, however, that the developer said they would help clean out the gully to prevent it overflowing. Miller said there would also be a retention pond at the new development to prevent excess runoff to other properties. Because many people were upset at the proposed Walmart development, Lassiter said he saw the proposed subdivision as the best alternative for the land. In regard to density issues, Lassiter said the area was already dense, and the subdivision would not change that. “It is what it is already, is what I’m trying to say,” he said. “The die has already been cast.” The planning commission unanimously approved the rezoning request, and it now goes to the Hoover City Council for consideration. Also at the meeting, the commission: Approved a request to add 108 acres to the Blackridge development at the end of Stadium Trace Parkway. The addition of land would not increase the number of homes in the development, Signature Homes Jonathan Belcher said. Hoover Executive Director Allen Pate said it seemed like a “no-brainer” to approve the addition because it would not add any homes, but rather spread the planned 1,150 homes over more land. Approved a request to allow 40 townhomes and a park across the street from the Ross Bridge Welcome Center in what Belcher said residents know as the “gravel lot.” Belcher said that during a meeting with residents, most seemed to believe the development would be OK. In conjunction with the townhomes, Signature Homes has agreed not to build any more multi-family dwellings in Ross Bridge. Previous agreements allowed for up to 110 more multi-family units, but those would be off the table with approval of the townhomes. Commissioner John Lyda said it was good to take the multi-family units off the table, and Zoning commission Chairman Mike Wood commended Belcher for "getting rid of the apartments.” Sent a request for a car wash and detailing company off of Alabama 119 and Tattersall Drive near Greystone to the City Council without a recommendation. The request was submitted by Warren Bailey, representing Blue Rain Express Car Wash. A motion was made to deny the request, with three votes in favor of the motion and three against. The request will go on to the Hoover City Council presented as a tie vote. Community members who spoke in opposition of the car wash included a Greystone resident who said she and neighbors were “not ecstatic” about having a car wash backing up to their property and a man who said he received approval to build a car wash across the street in unincorporated Shelby County. Approved a request from Jim and Lynn Estes to combine two lots into one in the Park Lane addition to Riverchase. Approved a request from Tameron Honda to combine four lots on property along Sierra Drive into one lot. Approved the resurvey of several lots in phase five of the Northampton portion of Ross Bridge. Approved a request to reconfigure several lots in the commercial sector of Ross Bridge. Delayed consideration of a request to divide one lot in the second sector of International Park into two lots until the Oct. 10 Hoover Planning and Zoning Commission meeting. The resurvey would create ingress/egress utility and drainage easements for a road that Vestavia Hills wants to build to a new city park being developed on the former Altadena Valley Country Club property off Acton Road.

The figures, which reveal that Walmart, Apple and Shell alone are now richer than Russia, Belgium and Sweden, were released by the campaign group Global Justice Now. Sixty-nine of the world’s 100 top economic entities are now corporations instead of countries – a rise from last year’s staggering figure of 63. Out of the top 200 entities in the world, a whopping 153 were found to be corporations. Read more ‘Time to pull secret trade deal TTIP out of the shadows’ The US, China, Germany, Japan, France and the UK comprise the top six economic entities followed by Italy, Brazil and Canada. “The vast wealth and power of corporations is at the heart of so many of the world’s problems – like inequality and climate change,” said Nick Dearden, director of Global Justice Now. “The drive for short-term profits today seems to trump basic human rights for millions of people on the planet. These figures show the problem is getting worse,” he added. The London-based campaign group released the figures in an effort to put increased pressure on the British government ahead of their working group with the UN. The meeting, led by Ecuador, was established with the aim of working towards a binding treaty that would ensure “transnational corporations abide by the full range of human rights responsibilities”. “The UK government has facilitated this rise in corporate power – through tax structures, trade deals and even aid programmes that help big business,” said Dearden.

NEW DELHI: Global companies are cold in setting up brick-and-mortar stores because they are either confused about the new amendments to policy allowing 100% foreign investment in food retailing and relaxing the years that "cutting edge" single brand companies can avoid the 30% local sourcing to eight years from five years because they are fearful the new regulations skew up a level-playing field in food retailing. A senior executive of a global company, which was hopeful of a more liberal retail regime and was contemplating setting up brick-and-mortar stores, said the new food retailing policy does not provide a level-playing field to multinational retailers vis-a-vis domestic counterparts. "Imagine a scenario where there are two outlets within five km radius. The shop owned by a domestic company is allowed to sell everything — from local and imported food items to general merchandise while the outlet owned by the foreign company is allowed to sell only food products sourced and produced within India. Where do you think the consumer will go?" He said there are high costs associated with retail in India including skyrocketing rentals, overhead costs and other expenses including electricity charges that makes it very difficult to make money on wafer thin margins associated with food-only retailing. Asked if Walmart India is preparing to open food-only stores in India, its spokesperson said: "We are evaluating the model as per the guidelines announced." The lacklustre response from global firms to set up physical stores has punctured the government's high hopes of attracting heavy foreign capital and know-how to create millions of jobs and improve farmers' incomes by opening up FDI (foreign direct investment) in retailing of food manufactured and sourced within India. Now, the government is using various methods from luring companies to even pressurising them to invest, according to various executives directly aware of the matter. Earlier this month, Minister for Food Processing Harsimrat Kaur Badal, a proponent of FDI in food retailing, headed a team of officials to London and met representatives of British retailers including Tesco, Sainsbury's, Harrods, Marks & Spencer and Cobra Beer in a bid to drum up support for the non-starter policy. Prior to that, the top bureaucrat of the ministry invited officials from Walmart, Nestle, Heinz, Thailand's CP Foods and others firms to gauge the mood among foreign food and retailing companies on the new FDI policy and to get their feedback. The executives told government must allow such ventures to also sell a small portion of non-food items to make such ventures work. Some executives even suggested allowing about 15% non-food in such stores, according to officials who attended the meeting in New Delhi. K Radhakrishnan, co-founder of Grocermax.com, said even if companies including Walmart and Tesco apply for such ventures, it may not see overwhelming response from companies to actually open such outlets until the government allows companies to run an amalgamation of food and non-food stuff. "While this policy is progressive but it will not create any difference because it is not possible to open stores which only sell food," said Radhakrishnan, a food retailing veteran who has worked as head of food at Future Group. "The customer shops for everything in one place when it comes to grocery shopping. As per this legislation, I have to go somewhere else if I want to buy toothpaste." Radhakrishnan and other food-retailing experts feel various companies including Walmart, Tesco and even online grocery retailers may apply for the food licence in coming months anyway so that they are ready whenever the government tweaks the rules to allow non-food items in such stores. "Since there is a notification and it is allowing them to take 100% FDI, they may make applications and keep the permission," says Radhakrishnan. "This is the stepping stone to open up fully. It is a precursor to a larger plan whenever the time is right." In June, India amended its single brand retail policy for "cutting edge technology" companies by extending the period from 5 years to 8 years. ET VIEW: Scrap the rule The government should simply scrap the sourcing rule if is serious about attracting FDI. There is no reason why a retailer should not have the leeway to decide on how much to source locally and how much from abroad. The reasoning is simple. The economics of production that includes scale, capital concentration, skill and other costs determine how and where things should be made, subject, of course, to the essential forces of technology at any time. To nurture the SME sector, we need reforms on other fronts, not absurd conditions. Stay on top of business news with The Economic Times App. Download it Now!

Some segments are less crash prone than traffic counts would indicate. The figures used in this analysis are average daily traffic from 2014 and crashes recorded from 2012 through 2015. Numbers show that caution is advised when traveling through certain zones and in a couple of instances, construction makes a big difference in the lack of accidents. Also factoring in these numbers are the number of traffic inlets over these segments and the distance involved from one intersection to another as reference points. For example, one area may have a higher number of accidents that happens in a bigger amount of space. Take 41st Street and Louise Avenue. Having the Big Sioux River nearby increases the survey area as far as the City is concerned for calculating crash data. The eastern segment of that area stretches all the way to Kiwanis Avenue. The other “spokes” are much shorter that feed that junction with the north side stopping at Walmart, Shirley Avenue to the west and Empire Place to the south. This whole area totaled 194 crashes over four years. Plus this area is the highest traveled stretch of street in the city. You could make a case that 41st and Western Avenue is more likely to produce a fender-bender with fewer cars as the 9th highest traffic count in the city and a tighter area than 41st and Louise. The City uses only three “spokes” with no data on the north coming out of a residential area, 49th Street is the mark to the south, Holly to the west and West Avenue going eastward. A whopping 171 crashes came in that area. Not far behind on the danger scale is 41st and Minnesota with the same makeup as the junction with Western and is the 7th most cars flowing through. There are only three listed access points with residential on the eastern stretch, Norton Avenue to the west, 37th Street on the north side and I-229 to the south. Over the past four years 135 crashes took place. The other interesting factor in the numbers is 57th and Louise which is the 2nd highest in traffic counts, but only 122 reported crashes. Plus there is a lot of distance to the east and west from Solberg to Western and 49th Street to the north with I-229 Southbound on the south end. Lastly there’s the junctions with controlled access highways. Three of them get heavy traffic, but two of them are pretty safe. 41st Street from Terry Avenue to Empire Place which has cars coming off and going on I-29 has 122 accidents in the survey period. Compare that to 10th Street and I-229 or 12th Street and I-29 with just a few thousand fewer cars per day and only 48 and 40 crashes respectively. The one similarity to the places with lower numbers is the design of the intersection. Both of these are “Center Point” intersections where all the signals are in one place which may have a major influence of controlling traffic flow. The amount of distance covered reveals a little more evidence of safety on 12th Street because it’s double compared to 41st and 10th Streets. In conclusion, 41st Street as a whole is still a popular stretch of road. Just don’t let your guard down when you get past Louise Avenue.

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. Story highlights The attackers shot one of the men The other man returned fire (CNN)Were it not for two good Samaritans who risked their lives, a Kansas City mother and her baby may have not survived an attack in a Walmart parking lot. And most likely, neither would they. It happened in Shawnee, Kansas, over the weekend, police told CNN. Two men attacked the 39-year-old mother as she was putting her baby in a car seat. They struck her in the back of her head, said Shawnee police Maj. Dan Tennis. Hearing the mother's screams, the good Samaritans rushed to help. One of them, 33-year-old Air Force veteran Joshua Owen, was shot multiple times when one of the attackers, later identified as John W. Simmons III, pulled out a gun. Read More The second rescuer, who has yet to be identified, had a gun of his own and he fired back, killing Simmons, police said. The baby wasn't hurt. Police later caught the second suspect, 27-year-old Arthur Fred Wyatt III. On Tuesday, Wyatt was charged with attempted first-degree murder charges, aggravated kidnapping and attempted aggravated robbery. He pleaded not guilty and is being held in Shawnee jail. Owen, the wounded good Samaritan, remains hospitalized. Owen's sisters-in-law created a GoFundMe page to help cover the cost of his medical and living expenses while he's recovering. In just seven hours, the campaign raised nearly $30,000. "We are so very grateful for the outpouring love and support from everything. We are so overwhelmed with emotions," Leslie Owen, the wounded man's wife, said in a message to CNN. Brittany Parks, one of the sisters-in-law, also provided a statement from Owen's 15-year-old daughter Halle: "To me, my dad is a hero. He risked his life trying to save someone else's. I love him with all my heart and I'm so thankful that he is going to be fine. I'm so thankful that the people were there to help my dad. Without them, I would've lost the best dad that I could've ever asked for." The woman who was attacked has been released from hospital and reunited with her baby. The second good Samaritan, a 36-year-old De Soto, Kansas, man, was interviewed by police and released. The mother didn't know the suspects. CNN's Samira Said contributed to this report.

Graham For Dailymail.com Published: 18:52 EST, 14 September 2016 | Updated: 19:44 EST, 14 September 2016 e-mail 39 shares 1 View comments A young mother just shy of her 20th birthday was killed in a drive-by shooting on Tuesday in Texas after being repeatedly threatened on social media.  Lekendra 'Kendra' Childs, 19, was found dead on the bedroom floor inside her apartment when her boyfriend came home around 12.40pm, the Houston Police Department said in a statement to DailyMail.com.  Childs, who has a two-year-old daughter and worked as a cashier at Walmart, was pronounced dead at the scene.   Witnesses told authorities that a black Chevrolet Camaro with tinted window stopped outside of the Uvalde Ranch apartments on South Lake Houston Parkway.  Tragic: Lekendra 'Kendra' Childs, a young mother just shy of her 20th birthday, was killed in a drive-by shooting on Tuesday in Texas after being repeatedly threatened on social media. She (pictured above) was found dead on the bedroom floor inside her apartment when her boyfriend came home around 12.40pm in Houston. She was pronounced dead at the scene The shooter fired several shots from the ground below - aiming the weapon at the second level apartment where Childs was home alone.  'If you can see it's just a blank wall, they wouldn't have had known someone was exactly in there and it was a very unlucky shot,' Mark Holdbrook of the Houston Police Department told ABC13.   Holdbrook described the suspect as a black male who appeared to have a shaved head.  However, several reports claim that a woman may have also been in the car, but police would not confirm that detail DailyMail.com.  Police say they received a tip which lead them to a black Camaro parked in front of a home at Noah and Scott Streets.  Witnesses told authorities that a black Chevrolet Camaro with tinted window stopped outside of the Uvalde Ranch apartments (above) on South Lake Houston Parkway The shooter fired several shots from the ground below - aiming the weapon at the second level apartment where Childs (pictured above) was home alone. Her relatives say that she was targeted Detectives searched the car, but did not say if it was the one involved in the incident that left Childs dead.   On Wednesday, the hashtag '#RIPKendra' was trending on Twitter for a few hours, as many paid their condolences for the tragic loss of her life.   Police have not named any suspects, however, Childs' relatives say that she was targeted.   'I feel very broken, and it just hurt because she didn't deserve to go like this,' the victim's cousin, Angel Whitaker, told ABC 13.  'I understand it was her time, but she didn't have to go like this.  'She didn't even make it to her birthday tomorrow. Tweets (above) from a user on the social media site dating back several months ago appeared to possibly target Childs, as thousands of people had retweeted them after the shooting accusing her of the crime In June the woman, who is allegedly the ex-girlfriend to Child's boyfriend, reportedly wrote the above message, saying that she doesn't care if police see the message 'Whoever did this, they were wrong and we will get justice for her.'  One of her final tweets shared days before her shocking death, Childs wrote 'Mommy will always be there' as a caption to a video she uploaded of her daughter.   As the hashtagh '#RIPKendra' kept trending on Twitter, social media users also speculated that the identity of the shooter was an ex-girlfriend to Childs' boyfriend, as one of her friends shared a heartbroken message about the tragic situation to Facebook. “How do you kill somebody this pretty behind a n****? You shot her dead in her head,' Quotta Taylor wrote to Facebook.  'D*** is not that serious for you to be sitting behind bars, because that n**** not gone write you or nothing. 'Karma is a b**** and best believe you gone get yours! And I'm pray for your baby daddy, because he was the one who found you man I can only imagine the pain and thoughts running [through] his head right now.  Back in January the same user reportedly tweeted the above message threatening to kill and eat someone, but did not name Childs specifically in any of the  messages 'She was only 19. She ain't even get to experience life yet, man. Kendra was all about her daughter and it's sad she had to leave her daughter in this cruel world ‘cause it took her mama.” Tweets from a user on Twitter who Taylor seemingly wrote about in her Facebook post date back several months ago and appeared to possibly target Childs. Thousands of people had retweeted them after the shooting accusing the woman of of the crime.  One message shared to Twitter in June of this year by the woman, who is allegedly the ex-girlfriend to Childs' boyfriend reads: 'my plan is to plot for a year.. And I'm gone kill them people...' 'We're aware of it and we've gotten multiple calls,' Victor Sentries, public affairs spokesman with HPD told DailyMail.com. The tweets did not name Childs, and police would not comment further as the investigation is ongoing. Anyone with information on the drive-by shooting are being urged to contact HPD's Homicide Division at 713-308-3600.   Read more: Update Your Browser | Facebook Share or comment on this article e-mail 39 shares Most watched News videos Autistic boy bursts into tears on stage as teacher snatches microphone Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Good pup!

(WDRB) -- Back to school means big bucks for teachers, but a Western Middle School educator won't have to worry about money this year. Meredith Waterworth was surprised Wednesday morning with an assembly to recognize her work and to award her with a $490 gift card from Walmart. That's the average amount teachers spend of their own money for their classrooms each year.  Waterworth is a new math teacher  who found out first hand this year how expensive setting up a classroom can be. "The fact that they're willing to go the extra step and make a way for teachers to get what they need, to help students learn, is a great thing," she said. Walmart is asking for nominees to award other outstanding teachers from across the country. Copyright 2016 WDRB Media. All rights reserved.

Highway Patrol trooper Sean Groubert will not take place, at least for the time being. Groubert, 33, who was arrested with his wife, Morgan, was charged with shoplifting at Wal-Mart last October. According to an arrest warrant in the case, the two allegedly switched price tags on items they had bought. On Sept. 4, 2014, Groubert, once an S.C. Highway Patrol trooper of the year, was the subject of nationwide publicity when he shot an unarmed African-American man whom he had stopped for an alleged seat belt violation. In March, Groubert pleaded guilty to assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature in the shooting case. He is now awaiting sentencing. No court date has been set for either the shoplifting charge or the shooting-related sentencing.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Emma Brown September 14 Follow @emmersbrown Freshman Prince Onwuvuche, 13, experiences virtual reality during an elective class at the Washington Leadership Academy in the District. The new charter school has been awarded a $10 million prize and plans to use the money to develop academic virtual-reality programs. (Bonnie Jo Mount/The Washington Post) When the Washington Leadership Academy opened its doors for the first time last month, it hoped students would be inspired not only by the stained-glass windows and vaulted ceilings of the former seminary building it occupies but also by the unique brand of education inside its classrooms. It wants to transform local students’ lives and give them unmatched opportunities in a school that looks like no other in the city. Now, it also hopes to make a difference for students far beyond the District. The Washington Leadership Academy on Wednesday became one of 10 schools to win $10 million each to show how American public high schools can be reimagined to better serve young people. [City living is difficult on a teacher’s salary. Could this new building change that?] The $100 million investment comes via XQ: The Super School Project, a competition that philanthropist Laurene Powell Jobs funded to infuse new energy into the nation’s high schools, where many still teach much as they did a century ago. Laurene Powell Jobs arrives for a state dinner at the White House in August. (Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP) Washington Leadership Academy co-founder Seth Andrew said he wants to create tools that will help schools radically reshape what and how students learn. The academy, which opened its doors for the first time last month, combines online, project-based and service learning with new and emerging technologies such as virtual reality. Someday, the school would like to work with holographic teaching — which could allow a person in Arizona to show up, via hologram, in a classroom in Alaska — and it is putting its plans and operations online for anyone to copy. Eventually, the school will post its lessons, too. There are millions of public school students who don’t have access to the opportunities they deserve, Andrew said. “Adding one more school is not the goal here,” he said. “You can’t do it 100 kids at a time.” Philanthropists such as Bill and Melinda Gates, Eli and Edythe Broad and the Walton family, heirs to the Walmart fortune, have played a key role in spurring changes in U.S. education policy during the past decade, doling out millions of dollars in grants to encourage fast-growing charter schools, new Common Core State Standards and teacher evaluations tied to student test scores. The donations have inspired fierce criticism from those who accuse wealthy people of using private dollars to dictate public policy. The XQ competition was envisioned as a different kind of philanthropy. It asked teams of people in communities around the country to dream up how high school could do a better job engaging kids and preparing them for the real world. It’s not yet clear whether this approach will succeed in being less controversial. The challenge drew applications from 700 teams of nearly 10,000 individuals — 10 times the number that Russlyn H. Ali, XQ’s executive director, had anticipated. XQ had announced it would award five $10 million prizes, but Ali and Powell Jobs — who is the widow of Apple’s Steve Jobs — doubled that figure in response to the outpouring of interest. [Laurene Powell Jobs donates $50 million to redesign high school] Ali described the money as “risk capital” that would help the winning schools and others who care about education understand more about what might work — and what might not. Winners were chosen by 42 judges, including many in the education reform movement, such as Teach For America CEO Elisa Villanueva Beard and Cami Anderson, the former superintendent of Newark Public Schools, as well as school system administrators, researchers, college professors, civil rights advocates, an immigration policy expert, a student activist and the artist MC Hammer. Two of the winners are large, comprehensive high schools with more than 2,000 students: one in Houston, where students will work on solving local environmental problems, and one in Vista, Calif., where students will learn by examining and coming up with solutions for the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. A school in Los Angeles will target foster and homeless youth, co-locating with shelters citywide and offer flexible scheduling for students with complex lives. Another will partner with a museum in Grand Rapids, Mich., putting artifacts at the center of the curriculum. Half the winners are charter schools and half are part of traditional school districts; XQ didn’t want to favor one type of school over the other. “Those are just old fights,” Ali said. The ideas that rose to the top, Ali said, were those that didn’t allow customs to dictate how schools would use time or space. They are “beacons of what’s possible. They will, I believe, excite the nation.” XQ expects to announce more financial awards, resources and support for other schools that had promising proposals but didn’t make it to the final 10. Ali said there are dozens and dozens of ideas that they want to “reward and cultivate.” The XQ prize is only the latest philanthropic boost for the Washington Leadership Academy. The Walton Family Foundation and Breakthrough Schools: D.C., a coalition of local and national donors, also have donated substantial start-up sums, perhaps in part because of Andrew’s track record. Andrew — who recently stepped down from a White House job, where he was a senior adviser on technology — previously founded Democracy Prep, a network of 17 charter schools that serves primarily low-income students in New York, the District and elsewhere. Democracy Prep has posted impressive standardized test scores, but whereas it is a “no-excuses” school — with strict discipline and behavioral rules — Washington Leadership Academy takes a more relaxed approach. [Education secretary calls on charters to rethink discipline] Students walk to their elective classes at Washington Leadership Academy in the District. (Bonnie Jo Mount/The Washington Post) As they move from class to class, students don’t have to walk silently in lines; they’re allowed to listen to headphones when they’re working independently in class; and they can slouch a little bit. It’s a reflection of an evolution away from the no-excuses approach in the charter-school world. Stacy Kane, Washington Leadership Academy’s executive director, said that as she and her colleagues visited other schools to build theirs, they saw graduates of no-excuses schools struggling with self-advocacy and self-direction. “The culture we’re trying to build here is not a lockdown, no-excuses culture. It’s a relationship culture,” Kane said. The school sees itself as a place to refine and share ideas that could work anywhere. But the founders want to do more than be an example, they want to use the XQ money to create a library of lessons and courses, delivered via virtual-reality technology, that other schools can use. Andrew said one of their first projects will be to create virtual-reality content for schools nationwide, such as a virtual-reality chemistry lab that could give hundreds of thousands of students a chance to learn science hands-on. Washington Leadership Academy also is experimenting with a new approach to staffing, tapping into the freelance “gig economy” to hire part-time teachers with specific, hard-to-find skills, such as Silicon Valley programmers who don’t want to leave their jobs but could teach a class remotely. In-the-flesh freelancers are teaching many of the elective classes — which include photography, DJing and criminal forensics — that students take at the end of each long, 8:30-to-5 day. The school also plans for all of its students to take computer science for four years, an effort to equip them with skills that are meant to set them apart as they go off to college and look for jobs. By next school year, Washington Leadership Academy plans to more than quadruple the number of African American students in the city who have access to Advanced Placement computer science. In 2015, there were just 30 black students who took an AP exam in computer science. There are 110 freshmen at Washington Leadership Academy this year; almost all of them are black, and the school plans for each of them to be ready to take an AP exam in computer science at the end of their sophomore year. Khalilah Sutton, 13, said she was excited about Washington Leadership Academy because she wants to work in the tech industry. Coding is one of her electives, in addition to her basic computer science course. “I chose this school because they had opportunities here that would help me achieve what I want to do later in life,” she said. Seth Andrew, right, co-founder of the Washington Leadership Academy, teaches students about perception.

X What is this? Sponsored content is written by Global News' without any editorial influence by the sponsor. If you'd like to learn more... - A A + Listen When Belinda Hankins posted screenshots of a funny text exchange she had with her daughter over feminine products on Facebook, she had no idea she would become a social media sensation. It all started last weekend when Hankins sent her 13-year-old daughter Bella into an Arkansas Walmart to pick up some essentials. When Bella couldn’t find what she was looking for, she texted her mom and ignited a comedic back-and-forth. Since being shared over social media, Hankins took to her Facebook page to explain her experience. “I posted screenshots of a text exchange between myself and my daughter, AS I HAVE BEEN DOING FOR YEARS, because I thought it was funny,” she wrote. “This wild ride that has been the accidental creation of a ‘viral’ Internet thing. I did not intend to do that.” READ MORE: One man’s hate for Pokemon Go has gone viral Hankins says it all started when some of her friends had asked her to make her post public. She only expected it to be shared an extra half dozen times outside of her circle of friends. But in a span of a few days, the post garnered over 57,000 shares and over 40,000 likes on Facebook as of Wednesday afternoon. That’s largely because people, especially women, can relate to the hilarious exchange. This is hilarious… and this 13 year girl is soooo my shero! #VaginaZone #LazerEstrogenBeams #iDie https://t.co/yERSlwDp7B — Josie (@Jo_Muneroki) September 13, 2016 This needs to be retweeted plus infinity. 😂😂😂😂#vaginazone#feministmothering#smashthepatriarchy https://t.co/XJdf8gOk6I — Jessica Nydia Pabón (@justjess_PhD) September 14, 2016 Despite widespread appreciation, Hankins said she has received some harsh criticism from people online questioning her parenting choices. And while she refused to address them all, one critique particularly bothered her. “(The) #1 critique seems to be: ‘What was a 13-year-old doing ALONE in a drugstore after midnight?'” Hankins wrote. “Yes, she went in alone while I waited in the car. She does this ALL THE TIME, and is proficient at it. She even (gasp) uses a debit card! How SOPHISTICATED.” READ MORE: Facebook says it doesn’t eavesdrop on your conversations to show you ads She added, “My 13-year-old (14 next month) is taller than me. She has a set of lungs on her you wouldn’t believe… She is extremely precocious even for her age, and is about the age I was when I started babysitting for ACTUAL BABIES… The idea that she is incapable of walking into a store, buying a thing, and walking back out to where I am parked 10 feet from the entrance is just… I don’t even know what that is.” Hankins has received a flood of friend requests over Facebook. And although she can’t say she’ll accept every one, she does promise to eventually look through them all. “Friends of friends will be considered first,” she wrote, “and as for everyone else, I’ll have to see what I can see on public profiles.

When the police officer who stops you says it doesn’t. That latitude in deciding whether someone should be ticketed is considered officer discretion and professional courtesy. The two concepts were debated heavily during the Cliff Hardy trial in July. Hardy won a $300,000 verdict against the city of Tupelo after claiming that the police department forced him out of his job after he spoke on behalf of former Deputy Police Chief Robert Hall. Hall was indicted for releasing the suspect of a May 28, 2006, hit-and-run accident that caused an injury. Some called his action a criminal offense, but both he and by Hardy called it a matter of officer discretion. A state investigator found Hall’s actions questionable, but not illegal. Latitude given Officer discretion gives law enforcement the latitude to operate within the borders of the law, according to Ken Winter, executive director of the Mississippi Association of Police Chiefs. He called officer discretion the most important tool in law enforcement. “Discretion is the cornerstone of the justice system,” said Winter. “Every law can’t be enforced 100 percent of the time, so discretion has to be used. From police, to prosecutors, to judges, they all have to use discretion.” If officers write tickets every time they stop a car, Winter said, they’re not going to work for long in law enforcement. And if they let every one off with a warning, they’re not going to work for long, either. Winter said different situations warrant different actions. For example, if a car is stopped for speeding and police find it’s a woman in labor on her way to the hospital, he said, she should be let go without penalty. Discretion common Dr. David McElreath, the Legal Studies chair at the University of Mississippi, says discretion is not a concept limited to law enforcement. “A doctor has the discretion to decide what medication to prescribe a patient,” said McElreath. “Even the door greeter at Walmart can choose to smile at you or not. This difference between law enforcement and other professions is that being a policeman is one of the few jobs where we give someone a gun and give them the option to use deadly force. That’s why discretion must be used properly, because often people’s lives depend on it.” How to use discretion must be understood by the officers, McElreath said, and it’s up to the head of the department to make sure the lines are clearly drawn. Tupelo Police Chief Harold Chaffin said he talks to all of his officers about the use of discretion. “We tell them to use their common sense,” said Chaffin. “Everyone who speeds does not deserve a ticket and everyone who speeds doesn’t deserve to be let go either. We want our officers to have the flexibility to make decisions and use their judgment to handle situations. I can’t make a rule to say everyone stopped gets a ticket. That wouldn’t work.” Chaffin said the proper use of discretion is learned over time. A rookie police officer, he pointed out, is not going to make the same decision as a veteran. One officer, who’s been on the force a couple of years, said the department does a good job of making sure officers know how to use their instincts. “We learn a lot about how to deal with different crimes in the academy,” the officer, who did not want to be identified, said. “When we go out to do our jobs we are aware that we are not going to arrest everyone, but we are also aware that those decisions have to be made fairly and on a case-by-case basis.” When it goes wrong Discretion sometimes straddles the line between fair and unfair treatment. When it’s used because of prejudice or favoritism, McElreath said, problems start. “Discretion should never be used in a way that an officer lets someone go because they are white, old, young or a woman,” McElreath said. “People should not be given breaks because of who they are or who they know. That’s not fair discretion, but an abuse of it.” McElreath said discretion should allow for a good officer to use the power entrusted in him with a social benevolence. During the Hardy trial, it was revealed that District Attorney John Young had a speeding ticket dismissed, and that the son of a former North Mississippi Medical Center executive was taken to a mental health care center rather than to jail after assaulting an officer. Hall’s attorney’s argued that his action in releasing the DUI suspect was no different from Chaffin using discretion to dismiss Young’s ticket or the officer’s decision to take the executive’s son to a hospital rather than jail. Chaffin admitted there was no policy regarding the discretionary dismissal of tickets, but said the circumstances were different because Young was on official business when he was ticketed. Discretion doesn’t apply in every instance. Jamison Shell, the man Hall released from jail after he hit a boy riding a bike, was charged with a felony and taken to jail, so the former deputy chief had little discretionary power, and that’s where the problems for Hall arose. Winter said in some cases the law takes away discretion. “In domestic violence situations when an officer finds there has been a crime, he has no choice but to follow the letter of the law and make an arrest,” said Winter. “There is no discretion at all in those cases. There is also very little discretion in felony cases because of the serious penalties. You can decide which felony to charge a person with, but that’s basically where discretion ends.” In domestic violence cases, even if the victim does not press charges, the suspect will be arrested and charged if the evidence points toward the crime. But no matter what the circumstances are, McElreath said, someone will disagree with an officer’s use of discretion. “No one has a problem with discretion when it favors them, but only when they don’t get the outcome they desire do people complain,” he said. “It’s not going to go your way every time. Sometimes you’re going to get the ticket. But police write way less tickets than they can. Whether you’re going three miles over the speed limit of 30, you’re still breaking the law and it’s up to the officer to decide how to deal with that.” Contact Danza Johnson at (662) 678-1583 or danza.johnson@djournal.com.

You May Soon Be Able to Check Your Snail Mail via Email Share this on Facebook Tweet this on Twitter Share this on Google Plus Share this on LinkedIn Print this article Email this article Increase size The U.S. Postal Service has more employees—600,000-plus—than the city of Miami has people, and under the leadership of Postmaster General Megan Brennan, each employee “owns customer experience” for almost 1 billion retail customer visits per year. The Postal Service’s focus on customers is not new—Benjamin Franklin was its first postmaster general—but in today’s era of retail behemoths like Amazon and Wal-Mart and delivery giants like FedEx and UPS, improved customer service has helped keep the Postal Service competitive. At times, the Postal Service has provided the best customer service in government, and currently sits third in Forrester’s most recent Customer Experience Index among federal agencies, behind the National Park Service and the State Department’s Bureau of Consular Affairs. » Get the best federal technology news and ideas delivered right to your inbox. Sign up here. What’s key, though, for the Postal Service is how it competes with private-sector competitors because, as Jim Cochrane, chief marketing and sales officer for the Postal Service explained Monday, money spent with other deliverers is revenue the cash-strapped Postal Service isn’t collecting. And right now, the extreme emphasis on customer service has it competing quite well. In Forrester’s latest index, which measured customer experience among 319 brands in 21 major industries in the second quarter, the Postal Service scored 58, one percentage point ahead of UPS and 10 ahead of FedEx. “Every dollar of our revenue is at risk,” said Cochrane, speaking at an event held by Forrester in Washington, D.C. “We are an agency that competes against the private sector and every day has to deliver value that withstands that pressure. Customer experience is the final frontier for us, and every interaction matters.” The little things, Cochrane said, sometimes matter the most. One clear example: the “Say No to the Throw" campaign the Postal Service launched in 2015. The campaign began after customers began posting home surveillance videos—like this one—on YouTube. Not surprisingly, customers weren’t happy to learn mail carriers sometimes chucked their packages like a quarterback heaves a football. Videos went viral and the Postal Service’s image took a hit, Cochrane said. Now “Say ‘No’ to the Throw” posters adorn post offices nationwide, and the campaign also included video, talks and other communications designed to emphasize customer service and exemplary customer service. It’s been a “worthwhile investment,” Cochrane said, because the Postal Service’s internal data shows  its most satisfied customers drive 2.5 times more revenue for the agency than its least satisfied customers. In other words, happy customers spend more—so keeping customers happy directly affects business. “That little poster has done a lot for us,” he said. With holiday season fast approaching, Cochrane said he expects the “Say No to the Throw” campaign to kick in again, likely with videos, posters and continued education for front-line carriers. What Cochrane said he hopes the Postal Service won’t see are more viral videos of carriers pretending they’re throwing Hail Mary passes to the end zone. “My hope is you won’t see us up there rolling things on the porch,” Cochrane said. recommended for you Threatwatch Alert Thousands of cyber attacks occur each day See the latest threats ADD A COMMENT Emerging Technology: The Government of the Future Has Arrived Textual Chemistry: Getting to Know Citizens Through Their Words The Inimitable Effect of Standing on Productivity The Decision-Making Science of Effective Healthcare FROM OUR SPONSORS sponsored Get Smart.

Kids are back in school, Congress is back in session, and since it's an election year, the political industrial complex of America has just remembered the oft-forgotten fact that women make up more than half of the electorate and, therefore, probably should have been more than half of what politicians and campaigns were thinking about and talking about for the last three and a half years. What's done is done. So, let's not harp on the fact that most elected officials are men, most political consultants are men and most political pollsters are men. Or the fact that many men have a habit of forgetting anything they don't really want to remember. They're going to know when the Redskins are playing on Monday Night Football, but will they remember parent-teacher night? My sources are skeptical. [Forget About Great People, Where Are the Good Ones?] Other than remembering that female voters exist, are different from men and will decide the election, I think my favorite thing about this time of an election year is the way the female electorate is discussed in the press like an exotic, unknowable species. In 2016, the most complicated, yet most prized, among the species has become the Suburban Woman, the once social beast who used to walk among us, but now spends most of her time driving carpool, texting babysitters and communicating primarily with other members of her tribe. With such remote behavior, political professionals have traditionally only been able to understand the Suburban Woman by where she shops ("Wal-Mart Moms"), what her kids do for fun (Soccer Moms), or the one issue she probably cares about given world events (Security Moms). Headlines in 2016 will ask the eternal questions about this mysterious creature, like, "What do suburban women want?" They'll try to figure out whatever happened to all those Soccer Moms? And my favorite, for its sheer offensiveness, they'll declare candidate X officially interested in "wooing suburban women voters." As a public service, I feel compelled here to come clean that I myself am a suburban woman voter. After years as an urbanite, I was in denial until last week, when my husband suggested we get a minivan, with a built-in vacuum cleaner. After pausing to absorb the horror of this idea, I said no thanks. But reality had dawned nonetheless. [Hillary Clinton Has an Edge as a Democrat, Not a Woman] So to Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton and all of the other campaigns scratching their heads about how they'll be able to get the support of suburban women in eight short weeks, I'm sharing three observations from what I've seen this cycle as both a political reporter and an embed among the most coveted group of voters this cycle: 1. The "women's vote" does not exist. Like many voting blocs, suburban women are not monolithic and often share nothing more in common than their gender. Will Melania Trump and Ellen DeGeneres vote the same way because they're both white, married women over 45 with country houses? Will you and your mother-in-law? What do you think? 2. Women who have had babies have not also had lobotomies. The Trump campaign has signaled that his new outreach to minority voters is really about winning over suburban women who have been offended by his verbal diarrhea over the last year. But the suburban women I routinely speak with have been paying attention throughout the campaign cycle. Just being less offensive from now on isn't going to do the trick. Having a kid at home and a suburban Zip code isn't going to change that. [What if Joe Biden Had Run?] 3. If there's an X factor I've encountered this cycle speaking to suburban women at campaign events and rallies, it's character, namely a search for clues among the two presidential candidates and members of Congress that these are people of good character. They know we can't anticipate what the next president or Congress will face, but they want to know our leaders will do the right thing when the time comes. That they won't lie to us. That they'll do what's best for the country and make Americans proud of them and of themselves. In a perfect world, their next president would also substantially improve the economy, make the country a safer place for children, no matter where they live, and use the United States' global influence to make the world itself safer and more stable. Since it's not a perfect world, most suburban women I talk to seem ready to settle for someone who won't lie to them. But even that seems a tall order in 2016.

By Evan Clark on September 14, 2016 Share This Article Reddit LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Print Talk Deloitte found that 56 cents of every dollar spent at stores is influenced by digital interactions. Cultura/REX/Shutterstock Retailers are losing control — at least digitally. And that’s a big deal. According to new research from consultancy Deloitte, digital interactions influence 56 cents of every dollar spent in stores — or $2.1 trillion — up from 14 cents per dollar in 2013. But Deloitte said that even as digital becomes more important to spending, retailers have less influence on the shopper’s “purchase journey” as Facebook and Google and the like redefine what a great customer experience means with constant, real-time connections. “Any retailer who thinks they can build their own personalized experience to interact with customers anywhere near the extent of major digital platforms and find success may be disappointed with their results” said Jeff Simpson, coauthor of the study and principal at Deloitte. “Their limited interaction with customers — about six to eight transactions per year — limits their understanding of the ‘moments that matter’ in a personalized experience such as purchase intent and preference,” Simpson said. “Instead, retailers should more aggressively embrace integration and the native capabilities of the major digital platforms where their customers have already chosen to interact and transact.” The retail giants — from Wal-Mart Stores Inc. to Gap Inc. to Nordstrom — have all been contending with not just changing trends, but systemic changes to an industry that is struggling to find the balance between clicks (where all the action is) and bricks (the profit center). At the same time, the online giants have been working to help brands connect with users on their platforms. Pinterest, for instance, just completed a yearlong study showing that Pins that show products in “real-life” situations lead to higher click and checkout rates. Even though brands are adjusting their strategies to be where the shoppers, they still find themselves increasing getting their brand message out on the consumer’s terms. The study showed that two third of consumers prefer a “self-directed” shopping journey, up from 30 percent in 2014, and that the influence of advertising is changing. “Two years ago, 70 percent of surveyed consumers said they responded to advertising compared to nearly 30 percent in this year’s study,” Deloitte said. At the same time, shoppers have grown increasingly comfortable with trading their digital data as they parry with brands. “More consumers are starting to share their location and personal details to acquire better service and perks from a store or to receive more personalized e-mails with recommendations and suggestions to blogs,” Deloitte said. The survey showed that 48 percent of shoppers are willing to trade their data for personalized service. The consultancy polled 5,014 random consumers in late April and early May to piece together a picture the broader shopping picture. You're missing something! Activate your FREE PREVIEW now. Gap Inc.

Hong, File) SHAWNEE, Kan.—Authorities have arrested and charged a Kansas man in an attempted robbery and shooting at a suburban Kansas City store. The Johnson County District Attorney’s office announced Tuesday that 27-year-old Arthur Fred Wyatt III, of Overland Park, is charged with attempted first-degree murder, attempted aggravated kidnapping and attempted aggravated robbery. Police said a Kansas City, Kansas, woman was hit from behind by two suspects while putting her child in a car Sunday at a Wal-Mart in Shawnee. A Kansas City, Missouri, man who tried to help was shot several times. Another good Samaritan from De Soto, Kansas, was released after fatally shooting 28-year-old John Simmons III, of Kansas City, Missouri. Spokeswoman Kristi Bergeron declined to release more information about Wyatt’s arrest. The wounded good Samaritan is still hospitalized, FOX31 reported. “My son is just a wonderful guy. He’d help anybody because that’s just his nature,” his mother said. An eyewitness who saw the incident unfold told KCTV that two men were fighting one another before shots were fired. “There was two men on the ground fighting. I started honking my horn trying to get him to stop fighting,” the person said. “It was so chaotic and upsetting,” the man added. “I couldn’t wait for it to be over. It’s pretty upsetting to see a man shot in front of you and die there.” Epoch Times contributed to this report.

The deep fried destination is the idea of Isaac Rousso, who has been making fair food for years at the State Fair of Texas. He created cookie fries and fried Pop-Tarts. The in-store restaurant will be called State Fair Treats. The Dallas News reports that the restaurant will start off serving “cookie fries and funnel cake fries along with corn dogs, deep-fried hash browns stuffed with bacon and cheddar cheese and some new creations.” So far, only the Walmart in Plano, TX will have a State Fair Treats, but Rousso want to expand the his idea regionally, then nationally.

Randi Roper Perkins had been shopping at Walmart, when she spotted an elderly member of staff stood in the back near the electronics section. As she waited in line, mindlessly on her phone, the man, whose name is Mr Billie, motioned her over to him, before giving her a sticker and singing her a song. Then, he began to speak to her. ‘At first, I was thinking about how I might lose my spot in line, but I decided to settle in and talk to Mr Billie. I’m so glad I did!’ Randi wrote in a Facebook post. While speaking with Mr Billie, Randi learned that he was 85 years of age, that he was married, and that both he and his wife work. Randi said: ‘I learned he is concerned about losing his job because he enjoys it and doesn’t want his wife to have to support them. (Picture: Randi Roper Perkins / Facebook) ‘I learned that he served our country in the Air Force for 8+ years, and he can tell you how many months and days.’ ‘I learned he was the only one of 15 children to graduate high school, not because he was smart but because he was lucky. ‘I learned his second cousin was Brigadier General Chuck Yeagar, the man who broke the sound barrier.’ Alongside learning about Mr Billie’s history, she also learned a lot about his personality – the fact he was very loyal and respectful as he saluted every single veteran who came to greet him during their conversation. And then, the pair begun talking about today’s world. About how ‘electronics are going to be the death of family histories being passed down’. ‘He remembers sitting around the fireplace with his parents and siblings and them sharing stories of their lives. We don’t do that anymore,’ said Randi. Before their conversation ended, Mr Billie told Randi that she was the ‘prettiest girl in the whole store’ and ‘not to ever stop smiling’. Mentioning is at the very end of her post, Randi described her conversation with the elderly man as the ‘best 30 minutes’ she’d spent in a long time. (Picture: Randi Roper Perkins / Facebook) But not only was it a wonderful conversation – it was also a beautiful reminder to ‘slow down’, to invest less time in technology and to invest it in someone else. Randi’s post received almost 2,000 shares and was flooded with comments from others who have been truly touched by Mr Billie’s kind reminder. Many who knew Mr Billie also came forward with their own fond memories of him. One said: ‘He came into my work once to eat and told me how he has people come from all over to meet him because of a story his daughter wrote and everyone on Facebook saw it. He was so nice.’ Another wrote: ‘Mr Billie is a very popular guy and very well known in the community! My kids LOVE seeing him and he always sings! He is genuinely the best!’ It’s safe to say we all need a Mr Billie in our lives.

Upon arrival, they made contact with a female employee of the Smart Style Hair Salon (located inside of Walmart). The employee advised that she was walking from Walmart to Farmer’s Bank to deposit the money from the store when she was approached by a white male. The man allegedly grabbed her bag and ran away from the area. The suspect was approximately 6 feet tall, wearing dark clothing and a dark “hoodie” style sweatshirt. Officers ask that if anyone has any information regarding this robbery, they contact the Great Bend Police Department at 620-793-4120 or Crimestoppers at 620-792-1300.

It’s a worn-out cliché, but it’s true. “Time flies when you’re having fun.” And I can honestly say I have been having great fun for the past 30 and back still to 40 years. And I plan to continue to have fun serving the Lord and His people. This is certainly not a retirement announcement. Thirty years ago in September, 1986, my family and I moved here to Fayetteville for me to pastor the small group of Lutherans starting a church. Prince of Peace had about 30 people worshipping in the cafeteria of Fayetteville Elementary School on Hood Ave. Every Sunday we moved tables and chairs and created quite a cozy chapel where we had many memorable and spiritual worship services. And we had Sunday School for children, youth, and adults scattered through the hallways, as well. My family was my wife Elaine and our then four-year-old Jessica and five-month-old Andrew. We were what you might call the “perfect fit” for starting and growing a church — an energetic young pastor and his wife and small children. We had moved here from Florida where I had served two churches for the previous 10 years, going back to October of 1976, when I was ordained in Miami. That’s the 40 year part of this story. And our family was completed when our Rebecca was born in 1989. Thirty years ago Fayetteville was quite different than it is today, as you can imagine. And many of you long-timers here can remember much more accurately than I can what it was like then. But I can tell you that when we moved here there was no Walmart, and the first one was where Tractor Supply is today. There was no Pavilion, no Banks Crossing, no Town Center, and no Summit Point. To go shopping meant going to malls and stores in Jonesboro, Morrow, Union City, etc. About the last thing south of town was Melear’s Barbecue. Jordan’s Salvage was the edge of town east, except for the soccer fields.  And there wasn’t much west of the Square, just a straight shot to Peachtree City. And, of course, the hospital was not there. There were just two high schools in the county, Fayette County and McIntosh. But what was happening in 1986 was that houses were being built, and being built, and being built. And people were moving in, and moving in, and moving in. And it was exciting to be a newcomer to Fayetteville and then to welcome the rest of the good people who were gathering here. And this is where the “fun” comes in. I have loved the people of Fayetteville for the entire 30 years we’ve been here. And I still do! I have loved the people who came to be a part of our church. I have loved the pastors and people who have built up the great churches we have all around us. I have loved the people we shared life with as our kids were in school, in sports, in music, and everything they did. I have loved our community leaders and our school system’s administrators, teachers, choir and band directors, coaches, school bus drivers. I have loved and respected our police, sheriff’s officers, fire fighters, and all our first responders and public servants. I have loved our doctors, dentists, and nurses. I have loved the good people who work at the airport and everything connected to it. I have loved the people with whom we have done business in any circumstance. And, as I have said, I still love Fayetteville and all its people, and the people who move here or make their way here to work or to go to church or just to be a part of us in some way. I consider myself so blessed and privileged to have been the pastor here at Prince of Peace for these 30 years. I am thankful to God that we had those precious early years in the school cafeteria, that we were blessed to be able to come here onto our property on Highway 314 and build our beautiful sanctuary and early fellowship hall. Then we were blessed to add our next fellowship hall and classrooms for Sunday School. And I’m thankful to God that we were blessed to build our Life Center for contemporary worship and large dinners and even basketball games. I am thankful to God that I have had the personal relationships with you, the people whom I have been privileged to know here and the ones I have been privileged to serve as pastor. I have used the word “fun” in this article, but we know that some of being a pastor is walking the hard steps of life with people, as well. I have been privileged to do that, too. As I said, I am not retiring, but we will celebrate and give thanks to God for my 30 years here and 40 in the ministry with a “Homecoming” here at Prince of Peace on Sunday, Oct. 30. Please “save the date” and join us if you can.   Find Kollmeyer at www.princeofpeacefayette.org Justin Kollmeyer's blog Log in or register to post comments Section:  Opinion Columnists Ad space area 4 internal Stay Informed Subscribe to our newsletter Most Read Today 193 are unverified (2,495) Let’s examine the real cause of the 54-74 traffic jams (1,705) New roundabout now operational (1,601) Robberies on FCSO blotter (1,547) Aviation program seeks support (1,232) Ad space area house ad and ad 2 Recent comments Marc, you have hit the 27 min 23 sec ago Mike Mahoney That center is doing a very good job in a lot of areas... 1 hour 7 min ago Spyglass Attorney General Sessions 1 hour 24 min ago JessieJames1847 Another one 12 hours 9 min ago moelarrycurly Was coming home the other night 12 hours 42 min ago Husband and Father of 2 more Showcase 2010 EZGO Shuttle Golf Cart - Pristine Condition!

Sure, the legalization of marijuana is not yet official nationwide, but that doesn’t mean you have to wait until 4/20 to celebrate. Let’s be blunt: Smoke signs are a trending topic of conversation (hello, Vetements Fall 2016 collection of boots and heels featuring lighter stilettos), and just because lighting up isn’t quite legal, it doesn’t mean that we can’t elevate the conventional conversation around rituals and smoke stereotypes. With ultra-luxe lifestyle meets high-fashion e-commerce destinations hitting the marketplace—Au Box and Sweetflag to name just two—we’ve rounded up the best head-shop accessories.

The deceased's boyfriend came home to find his girlfriend and mother of a 2-year-old daughter shot to death in a bedroom in their second-story apartment. The boyfriend quickly ran out of the home to seek help and called the police, Sgt. Mark Holbrook, of HPD's Homicide Division, said. According to police, witnesses saw someone in a newer-model, black Chevrolet Camaro with standard rims and tinted windows firing multiple rounds into the apartment. Childs, who was a cashier at Walmart, was described by her cousin Angel Woodward as an all-around amazing person. “She lit up the room and was one of a kind. She would do anything for her daughter,” Woodward said. Woodward told authorities her cousin’s death is shocking because she didn’t have beef with anyone, to her knowledge. Childs’ 20th birthday would have been today (Wednesday, September 14th). On the same day as her shooting, she wrote on Twitter about how excited she was about her birthday Meanwhile, Childs’ boyfriend’s ex-girlfriend is being accused of the murder on social media. Facebook user, Quoyaa Taylor is accusing Childs’ boyfriend’s ex-girlfriend with being involved in the shooting that took the 19-year-old’s life. Taylor wrote in a lengthy message on Facebook: Taylor shared in another message:  According to Taylor, Childs and the ex-girlfriend had recently got into a fight, which could have led to the murder. “Kendra whooped this girl so she plotted on her and brought the tool out. this hoe grime #RIPKENDRA,” wrote Taylor in a separate message. “Did you really think this N***a would be with you after you killed his bm ? B*tch come back to real life THIS IS NOT A LIFETIME MOVIE #RIPKENDRA,” she wrote in another post. Other users on social media have also called the ex-girlfriend out over Childs’ death.

And most likely, neither would they. Two men attacked the 39-year-old mother as she was putting her baby in a car seat over the weekend. They struck her in the back of her head, Shawnee police Maj. Dan Tennis said. Hearing the mother's screams, the good Samaritans rushed to help. One of them, a 33-year-old Air Force veteran, was shot multiple times when one of the attackers, later identified as John W. Simmons III, pulled out a gun. The second rescuer had a gun of his own and he fired back, killing Simmons, police said. The baby wasn't hurt. Police later caught the second suspect, 27-year-old Arthur Fred Wyatt III. On Tuesday, Wyatt was charged with attempted first-degree murder charges, aggravated kidnapping and attempted aggravated robbery. He is being held in Shawnee jail. The wounded good Samaritan remains hospitalized. "My son is just a wonderful guy. He'd help anybody because that's just his nature," his mother told WDAF. The woman who was attacked has been released from hospital and reunited with her baby. The second good Samaritan, a 36-year-old man from De Soto, Kan., was interviewed by police and released.

News Business Business News Ikea, JD Sports, Morrisons: Business news in brief Wednesday 14 September 2016 Swedish furniture giant unveils ambitious China and India growth plans; Sportswear chain posts 'astonishing' growth; Supermarket aims to stem four years of losses amid brutal price war Ben Chapman Wednesday 14 September 2016 13:56 BST Ikea posted strong growth but CEO is targeting more ambitious expansion plans Reuters Ikea targets China expansion as profits rise 7% Ikea Group laid out plans to accelerate its expansion in China and open its first store in India as the world’s largest furniture retailer seeks to boost sales by almost 50 per cent over the next four years. In China, where the company opened its first store almost two decades ago, sustained growth will enable an accelerated pace of expansion, Peter Agnefjaell, Ikea chief executive, said on Tuesday. Ikea plans to open its first outlet in India next year and aims to have 25 there by 2025, he said. The retailer has a goal for revenue of €50bn (£42bn) by 2020. Sales in the 12 months to August rose 7.1 per cent to €34.2bn (£29bn), it said on Tuesday. The expansion in China and India, the world’s two most populous countries, may help the company achieve the target as sales growth stalls in Russia amid an economic slowdown. Ikea will accelerate the pace of its Chinese expansion to five stores a year from the three it opened in the past year, Mr Agnefjaell said. It currently has 21 stores in the country. In India, the company has started construction of its first store in Hyderabad, has bought land in Mumbai and is also looking at cities such as Delhi and Bangalore. “India is one of the biggest growth markets we see going forward,” Mr Agnefjaell said. “But it of course hinges on a continued good economic development.” India’s gross domestic product rose 7.1 per cent in the second quarter, though that was the slowest pace of growth in more than a year. Ikea’s total store numbers in the 2017 financial year will be about the same or slightly higher than in the past year, Mr Agnefjaell said.  Bloomberg JD Sports posts ‘astonishing’ growth JD Sports reported first-half earnings growth that showed why it has surged past Mike Ashley’s Sports Direct among UK athletic-gear retailers. Underlying pretax profit jumped 66 per cent to £77.4m, the Bury-based company said on Tuesday, an outcome described as “astonishing” by independent retail analyst Nick Bubb. The shares rose as much as 8.3 per cent to a record high. While still smaller than Sports Direct in sales, JD Sports has sprinted past its larger rival in market capitalisation, now being valued at £2.8bn compared with its competitor’s £1.9bn. By stocking exclusive ranges from Adidas and Nike in bright, spacious outlets, JD has attracted a new breed of fashion-savvy customers as Sports Direct’s stack-it-high, sell-it-cheap strategy has fallen out of favour. JD Sports “is clearly differentiated” from Sports Direct, Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Freddie George said. In addition to having the support of Adidas and Nike, the retailer “has significant potential to be developed overseas, where it now has momentum.” The first-half profit boost was based on same-store sales growth of 10 per cent in the company’s main sports retail business. It also has an unprofitable camping unit that includes the Blacks and Millets chains. While still predominantly a UK business, JD is making strides across Europe and beyond. It acquired 12 stores in Portugal in July and is due to open outlets in Brussels and Cologne, Germany, in the second half of the year. It has also acquired stores in Malaysia and Australia. Bloomberg Morrisons on course to return to profit  (AP) Eighteen months after chief executive David Potts took over, Morrisons is on course to return to profit growth this year after four years of falls caused largely by the rapid advance of German discounters Aldi and Lidl. That would put Morrisons, the country’s fourth-largest supermarket group, on a par with market leader Tesco, which is expected to post a small rise, and ahead of second-biggest player Sainsbury’s which is set to post another fall. Analysts forecast Morrisons will report underlying pretax profit of £150m for the first half of the year on Thursday, up from £141m in the same period of 2015. The firm has reported two consecutive quarters of like-for-like sales growth and is expected to report a third on Thursday. Given current forecasts it is likely to be the strongest of the big four, which also includes Wal-Mart's Asda, on that measure over the first half. There is also some evidence that the group may be in a stronger position than its peers to cope with the consequences of the Brexit vote. Morrisons has invested heavily in food production and packing and now has 14 plants, making it Britain’s second biggest food manufacturer and most integrated food retailer. While data is sparse, Morrisons says it imports less of the food it sells than the 40 per cent industry average. This would make it less exposed than rivals to the pound’s fall of 9 per cent against the euro and 11 per cent against the dollar. Mr Potts has cut prices twice since the referendum on 23 June. Morrisons also has a very small non-food offer, shunning the trend of other big supermarkets which sell everything from coffee-makers to washing machines and televisions. With many of those goods imported, here too Morrisons is less exposed to currency swings or a fall in consumer confidence. Reuters Football Pools to be sold in £100m deal The Football Pools is to be sold to its management team in a deal worth nearly £100m. The owner of the world’s oldest football gaming company, Sportech, has entered into exclusive talks with private equity firm Burlywood Capital, which has proposed setting up a new Aim-listed company that will then buy the Pools for £97.25m. The directors of the new firm include the Pools’ current managing director Conleth Byrne, who will become chief executive, finance director Carl Lynn and Sportech's former chief operating officer Ian Hogg, who will chair the company. The deal will be bankrolled through a combination of debt and equity, with Sportech saying the deal “represents an attractive opportunity” following a modernisation programme. Punters no longer fill in paper coupons to bet on football results, with the Pools now operating online. Around 300,000 players stake their cash each week in the hope of winning a maximum £3m. Football pools began in 1923 in Manchester, with Littlewoods selling coupons. But the firm has struggled since the National Lottery was launched in 1994. Nevertheless, Sportech said that operating profit for the Liverpool-based Pools came in at £7m for the first half of the year. Sportech consists of three divisions: Sportech Racing and Digital, Sportech Venues and the Football Pools. PA Job cuts and closures at Clydesdale and Yorkshire Bank  (Reuters) The Clydesdale and Yorkshire banking group signalled more job losses and confirmed around another 50 branches will close, as it ramps up cost cutting. Glasgow-based CYBG, which was spun off from former owner National Australia Bank in February, said it will trim its branch network from 248 to fewer than 200 over the next three years as it looks to slash costs by a further £100m. CYBG's latest cost-cutting moves come after it recently announced plans to shut 26 branches nationwide by the end of September and reduce its workforce, with nearly 500 jobs axed over the past 18 months. It will deliver the new cost savings by the end of September 2019 to help it meet performance targets earlier than planned. The challenger bank said its “refreshed” strategic plan also takes into account revised expectations for the UK economy after the Brexit vote. PA Hanjin bosses use personal fortunes to save stranded ships Cho Yang-Hohas stepped in to save Hanjin Shipping (Reuters) South Korea's Hanjin Shipping says it has received £34m from its current and former chiefs to relieve its global cargo crisis.  The chairman of Hanjin Shipping, Cho Yang-ho, spent 40bn won (£26.8m) from his personal assets on Tuesday, said Hanjin Shipping spokeswoman Min Park. She said former Hanjin Shipping chair Choi Eun-young contributed 10bn won (£6.7m).  The cash-strapped container shipper will use the money to pay for unloading billions of dollars’ worth of cargo stranded offshore on its ships. The company, South Korea’s top ocean shipper, filed for bankruptcy protection on 31 August.  Ms Park would not say how much money Hanjin needs to resolve the entire cargo crisis, citing business confidentiality. Hanjin Shipping is still awaiting 60bn won (£40m) pledged earlier by its parent company. The company said 93 of its vessels were stranded offshore as of 11 September, including 79 container ships. Four ships have been seized by creditors.  AP Ocado shares hammered as it warns of falling profits (Matt Cardy/Getty Images) Ocado’s shares fell almost 15 per cent yesterday as the online grocer said profits will probably fall below analysts’ estimates, showing the effects of a damaging UK price war. Duncan Tatton-Brown, chief financial officer said he “wouldn’t be surprised” if analysts cut their estimates for the company’s full-year earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation as persistent UK food deflation pressures its margins.  Ocado is mired in a longstanding price war with mainstream chains, as grocers struggle to fend off discounters. Amazon, last week extended its Fresh grocery delivery service across most of London. “There aren’t many retailers who can turn a blind eye to Amazon turning up in their backyard, and Ocado is no exception,” said George Salmon, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. “Despite higher sales and order numbers, competitive forces are likely to keep margins under pressure for some time.” Bloomberg Samsung blames battery flaw for Note 7 fires Samsung has suspended sales of the Galaxy Note 7 after reports of exploding batteries (Getty Images) Samsung has blamed a minor battery manufacturing flaw for prompting a global recall of its Galaxy Note 7 smartphones and is seeking more time to investigate the cause behind its deepest crisis in years. The Korean company outlined the preliminary findings in a report to the country’s technology standards agency that has not previously been released. Initial conclusions indicate an error in production that placed pressure on plates contained within battery cells. That in turn brought negative and positive poles into contact, triggering excessive heat. Samsung stressed that it needed to carry out a more thorough analysis to determine “the exact cause” of battery damage. While executives have referred publicly to manufacturing slip-ups, Samsung’s report went into more detail about the potential flaws in battery design. The company has scrambled to contain the fallout after 35 cases emerged of the Note 7 overheating or combusting. Bloomberg Chinese demand for compact cars drive Audi sales Audi increased global sales 2.9 per cent in August on strong demand in its key Chinese market for luxury compact cars, including the A3 and Q3 models. The Volkswagen-owned division on Tuesday said deliveries rose to 132,350 autos last month from 128,647 a year earlier, with eight-month sales up 4.9 per cent at 1.23m. Sales in China were up 8.8 per cent at 49,154 cars, expanding year-to-date registrations in Audi's largest market 6.8 per cent to 361,315. German luxury rival BMW earlier on Tuesday reported a 5 per cent increase in brand sales to 142,554 cars, with eight-month sales up 5.5 per cent at 1.28m.

So who's defending Alabama? Print Email Kelly Kazek | kkazek@al.com By Kelly Kazek | kkazek@al.com AL.com Email the author | Follow on Twitter on September 14, 2016 at 8:00 AM, updated September 14, 2016 at 9:12 AM comments Given the past year of awkward political scandals involving a 73-year-old, married governor and a plethora of not just Dumb Crook News but Nekkid Dumb Crook News, Alabamians are aware outsiders think we're pretty weird down here. As Pulitzer Prize-winning humorist and best-selling author Dave Barry tours the country touting his newly released book, "Best. State. Ever.: A Florida Man Defends His Homeland," I began to wonder which state requires more defense, Florida or Alabama? Who better to have that debate than Dave Barry, who since retiring his regular humor column for the Miami Herald authors a weird news blog, and me, humor columnist and weird Alabama news writer? It's a match-up to rival the Iron Bowl. OK, not really. Not even a little. Define 'weird' Before we could have a debate on weirdness, Dave – I call him "Dave" because after spending 20 minutes in a phone interview we're, like, thisclose – had to define what, exactly, is weird? This presidential election, for sure. The Alabama Legislature, of course, but as Dave points out, most states can make that claim. The woman who sustained bruises after being struck by a catfish that fell from the sky certainly qualifies, but that happened in Philadelphia, which doesn't have a dog, or catfish, in this fight. So I asked Dave which factor carries more weight in making Florida weird: The bizarre headlines about strange crimes committed by stranger criminals, or quirky roadside attractions like the Bowling Ball House and Art Museum in Safety Harbor, Fla.? "So you mean stupid vs. weird," he said with a laugh, immediately recognizing our categories. His answer was also immediate: "Definitely stupid. Just go to the @_FloridaMan Twitter feed." The feed contains tweets of headlines beginning with the words "Florida man..." that are based on real news stories, such as "Florida Man Caught Twerking at Judge." "It's hard to imagine any place in the world where people are doing that many stupid things in a single geographic region besides Florida," Dave said. It does tend to give the state a bad name, usually some version of "Flori-duh." But, as Dave says: "I like to point out that most of those people are not from Florida. They came to Florida from somewhere else." That's one reason he decided to write "Best. State. Ever." And he has a legitimate argument, which is basically: Really, is it Florida's fault? Dave's theory: "It's hot so they have a cold, refreshing beverage, and then another, and another, and before you know it they're naked in Walmart. In Michigan, they're less likely to do that." But Florida's weird seems to have a little something extra. "There tends to be a weird wrinkle to the Florida stories," he said. He gives this example in his book: In 2010, a woman in a hurry to meet her boyfriend was driving to Key West. Suddenly, and I'm surmising here, she says to herself: "Oopsy. I forgot to groom my lady parts." So she did what any right-thinking woman would do and began to shave down there, a feat which requires a razor and major acrobatics in the best circumstances, much less while driving along a highway. How did the public come to know this most private piece of information? Because she crashed the car and the po-po were called. You might be saying to yourself: "Wow, that's weird, even for Florida." Then Dave says, I'm surmising: "But wait! There's more!" Turns out, the man in the passenger seat during the driving-while-grooming incident when she was on the way to meet her boyfriend was the woman's ex-husband. Now that's just Florida showing off. Taking a different tone In "Best. State. Ever.," Barry takes readers on a tour of Florida's vintage roadside attractions. His introduction and the first chapter, "A Brief History of Florida," are written in his usual guffaw-out-loud style of exaggerated humor, but the subsequent chapters are thoughtful, amusing essays that took him back to his journalism days. A Brief and Mostly Untrue History of Alabama "It was a nice departure for me," he said. "When I wrote regularly for the Miami Herald's Tropic magazine, I used to do long feature stories. I'd go watch professional wrestling for a month and write about it, or get certified for scuba diving and write about it. This was a conscious decision; instead of sitting in front of the computer and reading weird headlines I'd go out and explore the state. It turned into a little bit of a nostalgic trip." It's a trip that's fun for the reader, as well, at least for those who enjoy great writing and want to know more about the Skunk Ape, or the mermaids of Weeki Wachee Springs ... and who doesn't? The moment of truth ... So how do Florida and Alabama compare? I decided to challenge Dave's knowledge of his home state to see if he knows how truly weird it is. I chose three headlines from last week and asked him if the stories originated in Florida or Alabama. Here's how he did: 1. Headline: "Huge alligator captured near two schools." Dave's response: "Hmmm. I think this is a trick question. It should be Florida because it has alligators so I'm going to go with Alabama." Click here to find out if he was correct. 2. Headline: "Woman reported pet rock stolen." Dave's response (making a pish noise as if I really had to ask): "Florida." Click here to find out if he was correct. 3. Headline: "Lawmaker: Ethics laws ruin all the fun in the Legislature." Dave's response: "Alabama." Click here to see if he was correct. The quirk quotient Unlike the people involved in the strange and stupid headlines we might read about a state, a roadside attraction worthy of the name requires a slightly twisted, creative mind and a who-the-hell-cares attitude. I, for one, admire that. And in the arena of quirky roadside attractions, Alabama is a contender. We have the World's Largest Mooning Statue. The Eggbeater Jesus Church. The Car-Bumper Chicken. The list goes on. Here's a quick comparison with just a few of the attractions mentioned in chapters of Dave's book: Alligator Attractions. Alabama has one gator tourist attraction – Alligator Alley – compared to Florida's 9,982, give or take. But we do have one thing Florida doesn't: Captain Crunch, who reportedly has the strongest bite of any gator. Bigfoot Expert. Ours is no Skunkape hunter but we do have Jim Smith, founder of the Alabama Bigfoot Society, to keep us informed of the comings and goings of furry humanoid creatures that no one has ever seen. Live Mermaid Shows. I have to admit, Alabama is lacking in mermaids. In their stead, I will offer up the Lady in the Bay, a massive sculpture of a woman's head, shoulders and knees emerging from the bay at Barber Marina in Elberta. She's not alive, and she doesn't give a show, but she is nekkid. As far as we know. Debauched Town. I concede. Florida has Alabama beat with Key West and, as someone whose visited, I'm OK with that. There should never be more than one Key West per country. Or maybe per planet.

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. Story highlights The attackers shot one of the men The other man returned fire (CNN)Were it not for two good Samaritans who risked their lives, a Kansas City mother and her baby may have not survived an attack in a Walmart parking lot. And most likely, neither would they. It happened in Shawnee, Kansas, over the weekend, police told CNN. Two men attacked the 39-year-old mother as she was putting her baby in a car seat. They struck her in the back of her head, said Shawnee police Maj. Dan Tennis. Hearing the mother's screams, the good Samaritans rushed to help. One of them, 33-year-old Air Force veteran Joshua Owen, was shot multiple times when one of the attackers, later identified as John W. Simmons III, pulled out a gun. Read More The second rescuer, who has yet to be identified, had a gun of his own and he fired back, killing Simmons, police said. The baby wasn't hurt. Police later caught the second suspect, 27-year-old Arthur Fred Wyatt III. On Tuesday, Wyatt was charged with attempted first-degree murder charges, aggravated kidnapping and attempted aggravated robbery. He pleaded not guilty and is being held in Shawnee jail. Owen, the wounded good Samaritan, remains hospitalized. Owen's sisters-in-law created a GoFundMe page to help cover the cost of his medical and living expenses while he's recovering. In just seven hours, the campaign raised nearly $30,000. "We are so very grateful for the outpouring love and support from everything. We are so overwhelmed with emotions," Leslie Owen, the wounded man's wife, said in a message to CNN. Brittany Parks, one of the sisters-in-law, also provided a statement from Owen's 15-year-old daughter Halle: "To me, my dad is a hero. He risked his life trying to save someone else's. I love him with all my heart and I'm so thankful that he is going to be fine. I'm so thankful that the people were there to help my dad. Without them, I would've lost the best dad that I could've ever asked for." The woman who was attacked has been released from hospital and reunited with her baby. The second good Samaritan, a 36-year-old De Soto, Kansas, man, was interviewed by police and released. The mother didn't know the suspects. CNN's Samira Said contributed to this report.

Close Latest Minutes Politics Culture Magazine Climate Books Podcasts Subscribe About Advertise Contact FAQ Jobs RSS Masthead Privacy Subscriber Services Menu Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images Obama Thanks Himself—for a Slow, Partial Recovery A good 2015 doesn’t make up for years of stagnation. By David Dayen September 14, 2016 Americans got a raise last year, for the first time since the Great Recession. The Census Bureau’s annual Income and Poverty Data, released on Tuesday, showed a robust 5.2 percent increase in median household income. Adding to the good news, fewer families subsisted in poverty while fewer people went without health insurance. Given the widespread reaction to the report—seemingly everybody invoking the meme “Thanks Obama” in a straight-up way, in a chorus that was joined by the President himself at a Hillary Clinton rally yesterday—you would think this cements the triumph of administration policies to bring about economic success. And there’s no question that aggregate positive outcomes are far better than aggregate negative ones. Obamacare absolutely made a difference for the uninsured population, and a strong job market created the conditions for income gains. But digging into the data reveals a more complicated picture, especially when put in the context of what we’ve been through in the Obama era. First of all, we should be chastened by the fact that this is the first gain in median household income since 2007. That means that, after eight years in the wilderness, the post-recession recovery for the middle class only started in 2015. It was a sharp-enough bump to restore much of the loss of the recession years. But that doesn’t make up for the opportunity cost of a near-decade of stagnation. Even with last year’s increase, households are still making 1.6 percent less than they did in 2007, and wages have been flat overall for the entire millennium (for men, earnings have flat-lined since the 1970s). And that begs the question of why it took this long for the recovery to reach the ordinary American. What opportunities were available to get results like this earlier in the business cycle, rather than eight years into it? What if households received relief from their debt overhang and returned to spending sooner? What if we didn’t pre-empt the recovery with unnecessary austerity? A good report like this five years ago would have prevented a lot of pain, and the 2015 experience shows that it was well within our grasp. Even putting the past aside, we’ll need several more years like this to reverse the Great Recession’s scarring. One particularly powerful data point in the Census report shows how bad it’s been: From 2009 to 2012, 34.5 percent of the population—over one in three—had at least one period of poverty lasting two months or more. We need lots of good news, not just one year. We should also be alarmed at how hard it can be in our modern economy to get income, poverty, and health insurance moving in the right direction. This was the first instance since 1999 of higher income, lower poverty, and more Americans being insured (and only the second time ever since these reports began to be compiled concurrently in 1988). And despite these positive figures, inequality did not really budge. It’s true that incomes at the lower percentiles grew faster than those at the top in 2015. But most of the traditional measures of inequality studied by the Census did not move in a statistically significant direction. We still have two economies, one for the rich and one for the rest. We still have two economies, one for the rich and one for the rest. We’re also seeing rising geographical inequality—a few islands of prosperity amid a sea of misery. Income growth was rapid inside large cities (7.3 percent), home to more than 40 million workers. But outside metropolitan statistical areas—in other words, in rural America—those 20 million workers saw their incomes decline from 2014 to 2015 by an average of 2 percent. The poverty numbers tell a similar story: The number of America’s poor went down all over the country except in rural America, where it rose 0.2 percent, a statistically insignificant number but wildly different from cities or suburbs. Rural areas did rapidly shrink in population over the past year, leaving less total people in poverty, even if the ratio was higher. But if workers in the countryside could not be reached even in a record year for the middle and working class, it speaks to something historically severed in our ability to channel gains to those regions. Public policy should not leave millions of rural Americans behind who cannot escape their geographic destiny. My suspicion is that if you examined this further, you would find the growth concentrated in a just a handful of metro areas—New York, Los Angeles, Seattle, Washington, D.C.—that are pulling away from the rest of the nation. Phillip Longman chronicled this phenomenon of regional inequality last year for Washington Monthly. The rise of just a few high-performing sectors clustered in certain areas and takeovers of local businesses by national conglomerates has hollowed out much of the country. It’s also unsustainable, as the high cost of living that accompanies these well-performing areas super-charges inequality and makes it impossible for middle-income Americans to live there. If we’re handing out credit for the positives in yesterday’s report, Obama might have to share the plaudits with an unlikely ally—Walmart. When the nation’s largest employer announced in 2015 that it would raise the minimum wage for its workforce, it had a ripple effect across the lower-wage retail space. Other department stores quickly followed Walmart’s lead, to keep their workers from leaving for higher wages. We can see hints of the Walmart effect in the data. While household income rose 5.2 percent, incomes for individual, full-time male and female workers only went up 1.5 percent and 2.7 percent, respectively. That means that the household-income statistics either reflect more than two people within a household working, or a big increase in wages for part-time work. The part-time hypothesis is bolstered by the faster income rise for workers making around $13,000 a year or less, which intersects with part-time workers. And where are part-time workers prevalent? Retail stores like Walmart, where employees are often scheduled for shifts at less than 30 hours a week. While it’s good that part-time workers are making more money, they’re still not making a living wage. A contingent workforce that has to cobble together two or three jobs to make ends meet—what I’ve called the 1099 economy—is not exactly one living the American dream, even if their income rises in one year. But we can pay unqualified tribute to another champion that boosted incomes and helped move people out of poverty in 2015. Walmart’s decision to raise wages can be partially chalked up to tighter labor markets and the need to retain workers. But it’s also about the momentum of low-wage worker activist groups, which have pushed for minimum-wage increases all over the country. I don’t want to disrupt the “Thanks Obama” narrative, but you could just as easily respond to the income and poverty statistics by saying, “Thanks Fight for $15.” Read More Politics, Economy, Barack Obama, income inequality, Great Recession Sign up for your daily dose of politics, culture, and big ideas.

Here are some things to know about the 19-year-old mother and the details surrounding her tragic death: 1. Kendra Childs was killed in a drive-by shooting at her apartment complex. According to Houston police, a call came in around 12:15 p.m. on Tuesday (Sep. 13) reporting a shooting at the Uvalde Ranch apartments on 5300 South Lake Houston Parkway. Sgt. Mark Holbrook, with HPD Homicide, said a car drove through the parking lot of the complex and fired multiple shots into Childs’ second-floor apartment. Witnesses told police they saw a man and a woman in black Chevrolet Camaro with rims and tinted windows. Childs was alone at her home during the time of the shooting. Her boyfriend returned home from work to find her shot to death in a bedroom in their apartment. He ran out of the house to seek help and notified police. 2. Childs had a 2-year-old daughter and worked at Walmart. Childs, who was a cashier at Walmart, was described by her cousin Angel Woodward as an all-around amazing person. “She lit up the room and was one of a kind. She would do anything for her daughter,” Woodward said. Woodward told authorities her cousin’s death is shocking because she didn’t have beef with anyone, to her knowledge. Childs leaves behind her 2-year-old baby girl. In a tweet from September 9th (just days before the shooting), she posted a flipagram in tribute of her daughter. Mommy will always be there ? pic.twitter.com/vZLisR8hte — 9/14? (@__TheKendoll) September 9, 2016 Gods greatest gift and my biggest blessing ? pic.twitter.com/3TfrDaF7ms — 9/14?

Childs’ 20th birthday would have been today (Wednesday, September 14th). On the same day as her shooting, she wrote on Twitter about how excited she was about her birthday. I turn 20 tomorrow ?? — 9/14? (@__TheKendoll) September 13, 2016 Her cousin Angel said it hurts knowing she died less than 24 hours before her special day. “I feel very broken, and it just hurt because she didn’t deserve to go like this. I understand it was her time, but she didn’t have to go like this. She didn’t even make it to her birthday tomorrow,” he told the news. One of Childs’ friends tweeted wishing her a happy birthday today. Happy birthday kendra? — bre? (@bryannaaaaaa_) September 14, 2016 4. Childs’ boyfriend’s ex-girlfriend is being accused of the murder on social media. Facebook user Quoyaa Taylor is accusing Childs’ boyfriend’s ex-girlfriend with being involved in the shooting that took the 19-year-old’s life. Taylor wrote in a lengthy message on Facebook: “How do you kill somebody this pretty behind a n***a ? You shot her dead in her head , d**k is not that serious for you to be sitting behind bars , because that n***a not gone write you or nothing karma is a b*tch and best believe you gone get yours ! And I’m pray for your baby daddy because he was the one who found you man I can only imagine the pain and thoughts running thru his head right now, she was only 19 she ain’t even get to experience life yet man, Kendra was all about her daughter and it’s sad she had to leave her daughter in this cruel world cause it took her mama REST UP PRETTY.” Taylor shared in another message: “yo she was real life plotting on this girl….jealousy is a crazy thing man the hate be so real. Okay I’m let Kendra rest now. I just wanna be the first to wish her happy birthday because tomorrow she would have been 20 have fun in heaven baby girl #RIPKENDRA.” According to Taylor, Childs and the ex-girlfriend had recently got into a fight, which could have led to the murder. “Kendra whooped this girl so she plotted on her and brought the tool out. this hoe grime #RIPKENDRA,” wrote Taylor in a separate message. “Did you really think this N***a would be with you after you killed his bm ? B*tch come back to real life THIS IS NOT A LIFETIME MOVIE #RIPKENDRA,” she wrote in another post. Other users on social media have also called the ex-girlfriend out over Childs’ death.

The ex-girlfriend (“Ling”) allegedly spoke about plotting to kill Childs on social media. There’s alleged tweets from the ex-girlfriend’s (alleged) Twitter account @___ladykocaine, in which she threatens to kill a woman who had been messing with her man. “I think I’m really evil enough to eat a mf alive! Like bitch idgaf about you..I’ll real life kill you and eat you bitch! Fuck you,” she wrote in one of the tweets from August. I think I'm really evil enough to eat a mf alive! Like bitch idgaf about you.. I'll real life kill you and eat you bitch! Fuck you? — linglingbaby? (@___ladykocaine) January 10, 2016 In another tweet, the girl, whose name appears to be “Ling,” says that the woman she has a problem with won’t be “around for too long.” “Nothing makes me mad about a bitch saying she was with my nigga or whatever cause like I tell him..the hoe won’t be around for too long,” the ex-girlfriend wrote. Nothing makes me mad about a bitch saying she was with my nigga or whatever cause like I tell him..the hoe won't be around for too long — linglingbaby? (@___ladykocaine) August 11, 2016 The ex-girlfriend also allegedly wrote in another tweet that she was going to plot on the murder for a year. “My plan is to plot for a year,” she shared. “And I’m gone kill them people. Idgaf if the P.O. see this.” my plan is to plot for a year.. And I'm gone kill them people? Idgaf if the p.o see this?? — linglingbaby? (@___ladykocaine) June 17, 2016 One of the most recent tweets on her page posted on Tuesday, September 13th (the day of the shooting) is a retweet from another user and reads, “I got something on my mind n I need to get to the bottom Ov it.” 6. There is a photo of the ex-girlfriend posing with a black Chevrolet Camaro. A Twitter profile named @Justice4Kendra (likely ran by a friend of Kendra’s) posted a tweet showing the ex-girlfriend/alleged murderer standing outside with a black Camero right behind her, the same car that was said to be at the crime scene. Omg here is the black camero right here @houstonpolice that's the proof that @___ladykocaine killed my friend pic.twitter.com/MCYsFmrphD — ??

They accounted for the difference in a tight primary for the state Senate seat vacated by Adriano Espaillat by electing his hand-picked successor, Marisol Alcantara. Pundits say the big winner in the race was actually state Sen. Jeff Klein, who is expected to add Alcantara to his stable of breakaway Democrats in the upper chamber, virtually assuring that neither the Republicans nor the regular Democrats can control the Senate in 2017 without allying with his Independent Democratic Conference. Alcantara's win also made a loser of charter-school advocates and Bloomberg administration alumni, who backed second-place finisher Micah Lasher, a former colleague of theirs. Ironically, they were joined in Loserville by their nemesis, the United Federation of Teachers, who went all-in for former City Councilman Robert Jackson with a six-figure independent expenditure and member mobilization. Jackson finished a close third. Lasher's loss was not the only setback for supporters of charter schools. Along with a separate movement supporting a proposed state tax credit for private-school tuition, they also tried to eject state Sen. Gustavo Rivera from office, but he walloped Councilman Fernando Cabrera by 26 percentage points in a rematch of their 2014 contest for Senate District 33. "Clearly the charter school/education tax credit folks took a beating," one political consultant said, noting lopsided victories by Brooklyn Assemblywoman Latrice Walker over term-limited City Councilwoman Darlene Mealy, Brooklyn Assemblywoman Pamela Harris over Kate Cucco, and Suffolk County Assemblyman Phil Ramos. "They spent millions on Assembly races and [against] Gustavo Rivera and will completely strike out." A source with the political action committee backing the tax credit claimed that the PAC won four of the eight races in which it played a big role. The PAC did not give directly to Alcantara, but one of its big donors, Tom McInerney, gave $100,000 to the Independent Democratic Conference's campaign arm in an effort to help her. Among the donors with nothing to show for huge donations to that effort were Alice Walton (of the Wal-Mart fortune), who gave $450,000; Christie Denicola, who gave $531,000, and financial magnate Richard Cashin, who chipped in $300,000, according to the Daily News. The vaunted West Side political establishment also went down with Lasher, but in truth, the deck was stacked against the white Lasher and the African-American Jackson from the outset, as Latinos outnumber whites by roughly two to one and blacks by more than five to one in Senate District 31. The ethnic discrepancy among actual primary voters was surely much narrower, but just enough Latinos turned out to put Alcantara over the top. Another loser in the race was Airbnb, as the Hotel and Motel Trades Council put in a substantial effort for Alcantara and can expect her to be an ally in the Senate, where legislation could break the home-rental company's business model in New York state. The union represents workers at hotels that compete with Airbnb for tourists, many of whom book home-sharing rentals that are illegal because they are shorter than 30 days and the homeowner is not present. The union has teamed up with the hotel and real estate industries to push Albany to crack down on Airbnb transactions that violate the little-known law. Editorial boards failed to provide their candidate with the winning margin, as is almost always the case these days: The New York Times, Daily News and City & State all endorsed Lasher. One shocking result—the upset of Assemblywoman Margaret Markey in Queens—enabled the Catholic Church to escape the loser list despite the victories of many candidates who oppose the tuition tax credit, a measure that could boost enrollment at struggling Catholic schools. Markey, in office since 1999, has for 11 years been tirelessly championing a bill to allow people to sue for child abuse that they assert happened decades ago. That legislation represents a huge potential liability for the church. Markey was crushed, 64% to 36%, by the unheralded Brian Barnwell, a somewhat conservative 29-year-old attorney from Woodside who knocked on voters' doors for more than a year. The incumbent was apparently hurt by not leading the fight against a homeless shelter proposed for Maspeth. Such results are so rare in New York politics that it almost seems more likely that the Board of Elections got the count backwards. If that happens, an addition of the agency to the Land of Loserdom would be forthcoming. But it seems more likely that voters' disgust with politicians and desire for change spelled Markey's demise. That dynamic has certainly powered Donald Trump's presidential candidacy, but almost all New York incumbents who had primaries won easily (albeit largely in areas less favorable than Woodside is to Trump). The last loser of the night was the public at large, which shelled out tens of millions of dollars to conduct a statewide primary that could have been held in June to coincide with the federal primary election. Assembly Democrats and Senate Republicans could not agree on a new date. Voter turnout Tuesday was exceptionally light.

Asda is owned by US retail giant Walmart, and are also reportedly planning to cut prices on some wines, alongside improving the freshness of its fruit and vegetables. Asda chief executive, Sean Clarke, who replaced long-term boss Andy Clarke this summer, said: “This week we’re taking the next step in our journey to deliver better value for our customers and to improve quality. "We will continue to listen to our customers and take action, with better prices for products they buy week in, week out.” The cuts on thousands of lines come after rival retailer Morrisons slashed the price of 160 products, mainly fresh meat, fruit and vegetables, by an average of 12 per cent last week. Last week, it was revealed Morrisons is aiming to win back customers who have turned to discount chains such as Aldi and Lidl, who experts predicted would thrive after the UK backed Brexit in the EU Referendum in June.

The move from the chain comes just a month after they cut the price of more than 1,000 products by an average of 18 per cent.

These companies have combined revenues than more than180 poor countries from a list that includes Ireland, Indonesia, Israel, Colombia, Greece, South Africa, Iraq and Vietnam.

But few complaints are coming from the likes of Murphy USA Inc. or Casey’s General Stores Inc. They’re making a lot of money from it. Filling-station operators and suppliers who mix their own gasoline with ethanol or biofuel are enjoying a profit bonanza by selling renewable-fuel credits to refiners struggling to comply with federal standards. Transactions this year are set to reach a record $1.8 billion. It’s an obscure corner of the petroleum business that companies like Icahn’s CVR Energy Inc. say is “rigged” against them. Refiners are required to add increasing amounts of plant-based fuels, and when they can’t find enough, they buy credits from blenders who aren’t covered by the mandate or have a surplus. The credits are created when a company mixes ethanol or biofuel with gasoline, which then gets a Renewable Identification Number that can be bought or sold. RINs prices have soared as demand increased and are now so costly that refiners including Tesoro Corp. and PBF Energy Inc. are investing in their own blending facilities. “When you have regulations, it’s almost inevitable that you’ll have winners and losers,” said Wallace Tyner, an economist at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana. El Dorado, Arkansas-based Murphy’s is a big beneficiary. The company operates more than 1,300 filling stations across the Midwest and South -- usually connected to Wal-Mart stores. Murphy also has access to fuel distribution and blending facilities that generate RINs, but aren’t subject to the federal mandate. In 2015, the company earned $117.5 million by selling the credits, or 67 percent of net income, according to regulatory filings. This year is even better, with a record $43.9 million from RINs in the second quarter. For a discussion of RINs, click here. Fuel blending created an added bonus for Casey’s General Stores, which operates more than 1,900 stores and gas stations mostly in small, rural communities. The Ankeny, Iowa-based company mixes gasoline and ethanol in tankers to generate RINs, which it sells. In the fiscal year ended April 30, Casey’s pocketed $31 million from credits, representing 14 percent of its record profit, a company filing showed. In the quarter ended July 31, RINs earnings reached an all-time high of $14.7 million. Some fuel retailers say they use the RINs windfall to help lower pump prices. That means consumers like Christina Matthews are also coming out winners. Every week, Matthews goes out of her way to fill up at the Murphy’s station in south suburban Chicago. It’s easy to see why. On Aug. 24, a gallon of regular gasoline sold for $2.07, well below the $2.25 charged at the Amstar station down the street and $2.49 posted price at a nearby Shell. “It’s a great, big deal,” said Matthews, 69. “It’s worth the trip.” Refining Costs But for many independent refiners who have to buy the RINs, the fuel credits are pure cost. RINs prices more than doubled in the past year to almost $1 a gallon as the federal government expanded the mandate for biofuel use in gasoline and supplies of ethanol and biodiesel tightened. While fuel retailers can generate RINs by blending biofuel with gasoline, many independent refiners don’t have the infrastructure. They just refine crude oil and have to purchase RINs.  Sugar Land, Texas-based CVR Energy, owned 82 percent by Icahn, saw the cost of RINs at its two refineries in Kansas and Oklahoma surge to $94.1 million in the first half of the year, up from $74.1 million in the same period a year earlier, a company filing shows. Philadelphia Energy Solutions, which operates a 335,000-barrel-a-day refinery, cited $250 million in RINs costs and low fuel prices as reasons why it must reduce its payroll and delay capital projects. Since passage of a 2005 law, refiners have been mandated to use escalating amounts of biofuels under standards set by the Environmental Protection Agency. Compliance is tracked by the 38-digit RIN, and the supply of those credits will tighten as demand grows faster than supply of biofuels, according to analysts including Goldman and Jefferies LLC. Under the law, biofuels should account for about 10.1 percent of what refiners produce this year and 10.44 percent next year. To meet that obligation, they have to blend more ethanol and biodiesel or purchase the RIN from someone else. Gasoline consumption this year will total 9.33 million barrels a day and will be little changed in 2017, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said Sept. 7. More Players As the market expanded, so did the number of participants. Costco Wholesale Corp., Alimentation Couche-Tard Inc.’s Circle K, 7-Eleven Inc. and Wawa Inc. are among retailers registered to sell RINs, an analysis of government data show. In 2014, EPA data show 60 percent of the 50 billion RINs transactions were by companies not obligated to participate under the law, Bernard Weinstein, an economist and director of Southern Methodist University’s Maguire Energy Institute in Dallas, wrote in a report last month. The jump in the value of RINs prompted allegations of price manipulation and calls to repeal or alter the law. Icahn warned regulators last month of mass bankruptcies from what he called a “rigged market,” which has been inflated by speculators outside the fuel industry who are permitted to buy and sell RINs. “Some form of RINs reform or elimination would make sense,” said Carl Casale, chief executive officer of CHS Inc., a farmer cooperative based in Inver Grove Heights, Minnesota, that has two oil refineries and two ethanol plants. The system created almost a decade ago “creates an artificial marketing force that really is kind of past its intended useful life,” Casale said by telephone on Aug. 31. Industry Infighting The Renewable Fuels Association, a Washington-based trade group, asked the EPA and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to investigate allegations of price manipulation. The American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufactures, a lobby for oil, along with Valero, the largest U.S. oil refiner, asked EPA to move the onus of acquiring RINs down the supply chain to fuel distributors and retailers. The American Petroleum Institute, typically in lockstep with the fuel manufacturers on most issues, opposed the petition, arguing that a shift in the obligation would create even more uncertainty in prices. Andrew Clyde, the chief executive officer of Murphy’s, said the condition of merchant refiners has more to do with their decision not to build their own blending facilities than the cost of complying with the fuel standard. “The folks that are screaming the loudest have also made strategic choices in the past,” Clyde said. “Some people may want to deflect the issue onto something else as opposed to saying, ‘You know what? This is the industry we’re in.’” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Kayla Hunter, 25, called 911 and claimed that her ex-boyfriend arrived in the parking lot of the Walmart in Halfmoon and threatened to shoot her, State Police said. But police said their investigation showed the ex-boyfriend was elsewhere at the time. After making the initial complaint, police said Hunter could not be located and would not answer phone calls made by the police. She was found in Albany, and police said she admitted to making up the story. She was charged with falsely reporting an incident and was issued an appearance ticket to return to the Halfmoon Town Court on a later date. State Police did not say when the incident occurred in their release issued Tuesday.

From there, The Hershey Company continues to explore how it can combine its brand recognition with Uber’s millennial following to build sales, Mobile Marketer highlighted.   The Hershey Company’s partnership with Uber started with a $5,000 test-and-learn promotion for Mother’s Day that saw Uber share Kisses candy with riders and give others the opportunity to send the product to loved ones through Uber for free. In a single day, 100,000 people ordered Mother’s Day Hershey’s Kisses.   Following the initial test, the partnership was replicated in five cities across Mexico.   Based on further success, the two companies developed a Valentine’s Day promotion that sold out Uber Kisses in eight hours. Additionally, the campaign reached 20 million Twitter users, or 40 percent of all Twitter users in Mexico, in eight hours. The hashtag #UberKisses became a top five trending topic in Mexico and reached Twitter users around the world, garnering 45 million mentions in five days.   For Hershey, the program helped the brand stay relevant to the millennial consumer, a market where Uber is strong.   For Uber, the partnership helped it increase brand recognition and awareness.   Read the full article from Mobile Marketer here.

Whittington Seniors, disabled staying mobile with Dial-A-Ride Dial-A-Ride driver Michelle Davis and Henry Burnett, vice president of operations, prepare for another day at the nonprofit agency's operations center. Photos by Ron P. Whittington For the Times-Union "If we didn't have this, for most of us who don't have our own transportation, we would be lost," Loretta Corraspe says of Dial-A-Ride. The nonprofit transit agency serves Beaches residents. Loretta Corraspe, who lives at Pablo Hamlet just south of Beach Boulevard, is one of more than 450 residents around the Beaches who rely on the nonprofit Dial-A-Ride service for affordable transportation and, more importantly, a level of independence. “If we didn’t have this, for most of us who don’t have our own transportation, we would be lost,” Corraspe said. Started 41 years ago by local ministries at the Beaches that were concerned with the lack of transportation for the elderly, Dial-A-Ride relies on little municipal support to continue operations — offering a round-trip for a “suggested” $5 donation from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. weekdays for the elderly and disabled Beaches residents who need it. Dial-A-Ride provides between 2,000 to 3,000 trips annually, operating in a 15-mile radius around the Beaches area from Mayport south to Solano Road in Ponte Vedra — with occasional trips to the Walmart Store on Hodges Boulevard. Calls for transportation outside its service area are referred to Connexion, the paratransit service operated by the Jacksonville Transportation Authority. To help supplement the cost to fund Dial-A-Ride’s operations, which is about $65,000 a year, the nonprofit agency also relies on fundraisers — including the upcoming Monday Tasting from 5:30 to 7 p.m. on Sept. 19 at restaurant Table One on A1A North in Ponte Vedra Beach. The following month, the agency’s biggest fundraiser of the year, the Dial-A-Ride Annual Celebration, takes place from 5 to 8 p.m. Saturday, Oct. 22, at the South Beach Community Center, located at 250 South Beach Parkway in Jacksonville Beach. “Every fundraiser that we have is vital,” said Dial-A-Ride board President Kathryn Latham. “The Square One event isn’t our biggest event, but every fundraiser is important. Even though we get some support from the cities, the vast majority of our donations come from private citizens.” Latham, wife of Jacksonville Beach Mayor Charlie Latham, has served on the board since 2014 and is in her second term as board president. “I’ve always had this draw to the elderly and their care. I felt like oftentimes they are forgotten, so it’s really a calling for me,” she said. “When I found out Dial-A-Ride was struggling, I reached out and joined the board and have been involved ever since.” In addition to serving on the board, Latham has reached out to others to get involved — including her neighbor Henry Burnett, a retired engineer and transportation professional who joined the board in 2014 and now serves as vice-president of operations at Dial-A-Ride. “Kathy came over one day and kind of mentioned they needed help and I thought ‘Heck, I’ll give it a shot,’ ” he said. “So, I went before the members and they approved me for the board. Then, about six months later, they put me in charge of managing the office, then the payroll, then recently put me in charge of the entire thing.” Burnett spent 21 years in the Marine Corps as an engineer before retiring from the service, then spent more than 16 years working at various highway construction sites with a company contracted by the Florida Department of Transportation. He received a medical retirement from that company in 2013, joining the Dial-A-Ride effort the following year. Burnett notes that the service faced shutting down completely two years ago because they lacked the funding to keep it going. While the service is in better shape today, he says keeping the donations flowing is “very much an ongoing thing.” Along with Burnett, who wouldn’t accept a salary for the job, Dial-A-Ride has one secretary who works about 10 hours a week and has two drivers for the single, 15-passenger bus it operates. “It doesn’t sound like much, but it costs money to run that bus,” he said. “You’ve got labor costs and maintenance costs as well. Fortunately, the City of Jacksonville Beach helps us by providing all the fuel and provides a certain amount of maintenance each quarter throughout the year — and Atlantic Beach provides us $1,500 a year.” Although their residents are served by Dial-A-Ride, the cities of Neptune Beach and Ponte Vedra Beach don’t provide any financial support for the system. “We get other donations, including grants from the Rotary Club,” Burnett said. “Baptist Beaches Hospital is a big supporter, and the ministries that started the service are still in and help with donations to keep it going. We have a ministerial association lunch once a month most of the year, and all the nonprofits are there because they all help support us.” ON A SHOESTRING Burnett notes that, just like when the service was started 41 years ago, Dial-A-Ride still very much operates on a shoestring budget. “For our event at Table One, we hope to raise $1,500,” he said. “That may not sound like much money, but it’s a lot to us.” Tickets for the Monday Tasting event are $25 each and include two drinks and heavy hors d’oeuvres. For each ticket sold, Dial-A-Ride will receive $20. Tickets for the Dial-A-Ride Annual Celebration in October are $60 per person and include dinner, drinks and live entertainment. Sponsorships are also available at levels from $250 to $2,500, where sponsors receive a specific number of tickets and signage at the event depending on the sponsor level they purchase. People can call (904) 246-1444 to purchase tickets or inquire about sponsorship opportunities still available. “Basically, with this event and others we’re just trying to help cover our operating costs for the service,” Burnett said. “But what we’re trying to do is get enough donations together to purchase another vehicle … a regular van.” Dial-A-Ride’s current bus has tie-downs for two wheelchairs, but Burnett says many of the disabled people they carry aren’t handicapped to the point that they need a wheelchair. “Many of them could ride a regular van and we could provide service to more people,” he said. “We could go further across the ditch as well, but with a bus it’s just not as economical.” Also, it would give them an option if their current bus encountered any mechanical problems. “If the bus goes down, we’re done … and none of our riders can get service until we can get it back on the road,” he said. Burnett says Dial-A-Ride provides transportation but, more importantly, independence for homebound seniors and the disabled in the Beaches neighborhoods. “This is a service these Beaches residents are counting on, and they’ve depended on it for four decades,” he said. “If we lose it, it’s going to be a very traumatic experience for them. Once you can’t drive, you lose your independence. When you lose that, it puts you further into a depression, and that’s the thing we don’t want. We want these people to know that we’re going to be there for them.” For riders like Corraspe, who has depended on Dial-A-Ride since 2000, the service is an essential part of staying connected to the community. “It’s very important to me because I rely on Dial-A-Ride as an affordable way to go to doctor appointments, the post office, bank and the grocery store,” she said. “And the drivers and dispatchers are so nice. It feels like family, so it’s a very, very special blessing for us all. We’re grateful to have this service.” Advertisement Most Popular News Mon, 06/27/2016 - 09:55 Adam Paulraj, 2011-2016: Born with rare disease and abandoned at birth, 'Baby Adam' defied odds Public Safety Mon, 10/10/2016 - 12:15 Blog: Hurricane Matthew News Fri, 10/07/2016 - 01:12 With Hurricane Matthew nearing Northeast Florida, authorities tell residents to ‘stay home’ Metro Wed, 11/02/2016 - 18:53 Jacksonville Suns changing name to Jumbo Shrimp   View all Local Store Sales » Advertisement More Tiffanie Reynolds Brown to lead Neptune Beach; Jacksonville Beach mayor and council incumbents re-elected Tiffanie Reynolds Piece of old Palm Valley finds home with Beaches Museum Jackie Rooney The annual struggle to get holiday lights up Jackie Rooney End of Daylight Saving Time doesn’t mean more sleep Load more   Contact Us Privacy Policy Terms of Service About Our Ads Advertise with Times-Union Media Jacksonville News, Sports and Entertainment | jacksonville.com © 2016.

Johns Hopkins School of Medicine Share Share via Emailemail Share on Twitter Share on Facebook Three years ago, Geoff Baird bought a drone. The Seattle dad and hobby plane enthusiast used the 2.5-pound quadcopter to photograph the Hawaiian coastline and film his son's soccer and baseball games. But his big hope is that drones will soon fly tubes of blood and other specimens to Harborview Medical Center, where he works as a clinical pathologist running the hospital's chemistry and toxicology labs. In the near future, Baird and others say, drones could transform health care — not only in rural areas by bringing critical supplies into hard-to-reach places, but also in crowded cities where hospitals pay hefty fees to get medical samples across town during rush hour. By providing a faster, cheaper way to move test specimens, drones could speed diagnoses and save lives. "It's superexciting to me," Baird says. The technology seems to be there. Drones are delivering pizza in New Zealand and taking condoms to parts of Ghana that lack reliable roads or access to birth control. Tech giants and big retailers, including Amazon and Wal-Mart, are testing drones for deliveries and pickups. However, "blood specimens are not like a book or a shoe," Timothy Amukele, an assistant professor of pathology at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, said in a TED talk earlier this year. No one knew whether bumpy flights would hurt cells or otherwise make biological samples unsuitable for lab tests. Drones In Flight Amukele and his colleagues transport donated blood samples by drone in this video. The drones climbed to over 328 feet above ground and orbited the field for 6 to 38 minutes. https://player.vimeo.com/video/123492106?color=ffffff&amp;title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0 So Amukele and co-workers conducted several experiments to find out. In their first study, published in PLOS ONE last July, the team collected several hundred blood samples from healthy volunteers. They drove the samples to a flight field an hour northwest of Baltimore, packed half of them into foam containers and flew them around in a drone for up to 40 minutes. The other samples sat. All specimens went back to the lab for 33 routine tests. The results were the same for each group, suggesting samples stay intact during drone flights. In follow-up analyses, drone transport also seemed safe for samples containing microbes and for donated blood. The microbial study was published in August in the Journal of Clinical Microbiology; a manuscript on the blood products study is under review. (Videos of each experiment can be found here.) "The results don't surprise me," says Bill Remillard, chief technical officer at TriCore Reference Laboratories in Albuquerque, N.M. "But until you do the science, you just don't know." TriCore handles nearly three quarters of New Mexico's clinical lab testing. And in a sparsely populated state, moving samples over large distances is expensive. TriCore spends $3.5 million per year. So after Remillard heard the results of Amukele's first drone experiment at a meeting last summer, the two started discussing a possible pilot study using drones to transport lab samples in New Mexico. While Amukele's experiments show it's feasible to move lab specimens with drones, pilot studies in real clinical settings are still needed to work out logistics. Questions include how to request a drone, where it would land, who would pick up the samples and how often a drone would need new batteries. Safety is another concern. Some drones drop cargo with parachutes or other release mechanisms, making it harder for people to tamper with the vehicles. But as far as how safe drones are, "those data don't yet exist," Amukele says. Though millions of drones have been sold worldwide, "we don't know how many crashes happen and how many are due to operator error," he says. The Federal Aviation Administration is starting to collect this data. It's a promising development for an industry where legislation has lagged behind the fast-advancing technology. For years, the FAA had imposed a near-ban on commercial drones, only allowing them to fly if businesses applied for an exemption. But in June the agency announced a set of rules for companies to operate drones in the United States, and on Aug. 29 those regulations took effect. The FAA expects the number of registered commercial drones to jump 30-fold, from 20,000 to 600,000, within months. "The rules had not been well defined. This is an attempt to define them," says Lawrence Williams, who heads business development at Zipline, a Silicon Valley startup making drones for medical applications. Zipline is focusing much of its effort in Rwanda, where less crowded skies, relative to the U.S., make it easier to negotiate drone delivery of blood samples. Another drone startup, Vayu, whose CEO is a co-author on the PLOS ONE drone study, is also dipping into the international arena. In July, the Michigan-based company did a demo flight in Madagascar, carrying specimens from a remote village to a lab for testing. Vayu makes a quadricopter plane capable of vertical takeoff — an appealing feature for hospitals with limited landing space. While it's easy to see how drones could improve health care in poor countries, Amukele thinks medical drone delivery could make a bigger splash in the U.S. Compared to Africa and other developing countries, the U.S. does much more testing per person, he says, and many of the country's 200,000 medical labs are collection-only sites that rely on central labs for testing. So "there are likely to be more [medical drone users] in the U.S. than anywhere else," Amukele says. As Zipline prepares to launch blood delivery drones in Rwanda, the company is also seeking regulatory approval for three projects using drones to bring medical supplies to underserved communities in the U.S. One project would integrate drone delivery of medications with telemedicine appointments at a small clinic in rural Maryland. Another would use Zipline drones to link a large health care distribution center to hospitals and tribal clinics around Reno, Nev. And for the third project, the company would partner with a regional blood bank in Washington state, creating a plan to distribute blood to various hospitals and clinics in the event of earthquakes and other natural disasters. Johns Hopkins was initially skeptical of Amukele's experiments — the review board thought his first proposal was a joke — but now the university is giving the pathologist space and funds to hire a drone engineer and continue researching medical delivery drones. In Seattle, Baird is working with Amukele and aeronautical engineers at the University of Washington on their own drone proposal. Ideally their test flights would take samples from Seattle Children's to Harborview, a bustling facility that runs thousands of tests each day. However, that flight path would violate the FAA rule requiring drones to stay within the pilot's line of sight. So the initial plan is to run 2-mile line-of-sight flights between the children's hospital and UW Medical Center, Baird says. Drones could be a huge help in poison emergencies, Baird says. In a typical scenario, a child gets rushed to the emergency room after accidentally swallowing some pills. Though routine tests can rule out some things, clinics often send samples to a centralized toxicology lab for confirmation and further testing. This can take hours. A drone could zip samples downtown in 5 to 10 minutes, Baird says, helping a child get diagnosed and receive medications more quickly. He also envisions drones collecting samples from patients' homes and bringing them to the hospital. You could prick your finger and rub the blood onto a card that a drone could fly back to the lab for testing, Baird says. In the meantime, though, Zipline's U.S. projects remain on hold, awaiting the regulatory go-ahead, and the Seattle team continues studying maps and sketching flight routes for the small drone test it hopes to launch. The team has presented the plan to grant agencies and gotten positive responses — but no funding yet. Like other technological advances, Baird suspects drones for medicine will "wait, wait, wait and then go very quickly."
